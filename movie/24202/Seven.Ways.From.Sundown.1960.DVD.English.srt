1
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,513
A Ranger?

2
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:36,433
- Now we get a Ranger.
- Let's whup him.

3
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:50,319
- What's the matter with you two fellas?
- Tar and feather him as a lesson.

4
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,307
Yeah, tar and feather him, you with us?

5
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,180
- Come on.
- Come on.

6
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,526
- Someone mind telling me what happened?
- Jim Flood happened.

7
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,409
Flood figured he was getting
cheated at poker by Ike Hanley.

8
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,112
He shot Hanley then shot his brothers.
That's when we needed us a Ranger.

9
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:14,979
One finally comes along, he ain't even
got brains enough to be wearing a gun.

10
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,997
- Take it easy Beeker.
- Take it easy?

11
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,643
After Flood burns my place
down and shoots four men?

12
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,006
Without a lawman,
this town depends on the Rangers.

13
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,359
Ain't never one around when you need them.

14
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,272
- Hey, the fire is starting up again.
- Hey, get those water buckets men.

15
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,770
Form a line men.

16
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,085
Mind telling me how I get
to the town of Buckley?

17
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:37,647
- About 30 mile due north.
- Which way did this Flood go?

18
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:40,892
Out that way, northwest.

19
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,068
But I wouldn't go chasing
after him all by my lonesome.

20
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,465
I'm obliged.

21
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:49,846
Better get out of this town though,
before they decide to hang me.

22
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:30,213
- I guess you fellas are Company D.
- That's right.

23
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,383
Captain Bledsoe sent me up from Austin
and I'm supposed to go to work for you.

24
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:38,997
- You Lieutenant Herly?
- What's your name?

25
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,372
Jones sir, Seven Jones.

26
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,547
You any kin to Two Jones?

27
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:50,374
Yes sir, he was my brother, you knew him?

28
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,455
I knew him.

29
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:56,748
- You remember Jones lieutenant.
- I remember sergeant.

30
00:04:56,935 --> 00:05:01,562
I've been here earlier, but I've been
chasing a fella by the name of Jim Flood.

31
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,935
You were chasing Flood?

32
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:09,881
Well, not exactly chasing him, mostly
just trying to see which way he went.

33
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:13,255
He sort of wrecked
a place called Beeker's Crossing.

34
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:14,749
What happened?

35
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:19,962
He burned down the saloon, shot up
the place, I couldn't pick up his trail..

36
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:22,869
Get a long start.

37
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:24,955
Hennessy, you'll go after Flood...

38
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:28,256
first thing in the morning,
I'll figure out which men you can take.

39
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:31,750
- You're not going?
- No, I got too much work to do here.

40
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,069
You take care of Jones, get him settled.

41
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:39,416
- How long you been a Ranger?
- Just since they signed me up at Austin.

42
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:44,136
- Don't you believe in sidearms?
- They said you'd issue me a revolving gun.

43
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:47,389
What about Clancy's old gun?

44
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:50,079
It'll be deducted from
your first month's pay.

45
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,535
Well, sure is a honey.

46
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:07,735
No, it's a gun not a baby Seven.

47
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,601
- Yes sir.
- You don't call sergeants sir.

48
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,398
You know how to shoot it?

49
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:18,884
Sort of, is someplace
where I could try it out?

50
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,908
About 10,000 square miles
of nothing out back a way.

51
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:24,109
Come on.

52
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,163
Take a shot at that gong out there.

53
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:04,415
That's doing it the hard way.

54
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:08,535
- You some kind of trick shot or something?
- No.

55
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,375
Try the rest of your shot.

56
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:24,004
Only safe place in
the whole valley was that gong.

57
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,079
I'll show you your bunk
and where you put your horse.

58
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:34,267
As soon as you tend to your horse, maybe
Mrs. Karrington will give you some dinner...

59
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,705
- if she's got any left.
- Mrs. Karrington?

60
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:40,505
Yeah, that's her house over there.
She's got the deal to feed us Rangers.

61
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:44,605
- I could sure use something to eat.
- Put your horse in the first stall there.

62
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:45,606
Thank you.

63
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,994
I just got a glimpse of him
when he went by the house.

64
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:56,957
I'll bet he's real nice.

65
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:01,317
Ma?

66
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:03,623
You think...

67
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,680
Do you think the average person
would like me in this dress?

68
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,463
They told me I might
be able to get something to eat.

69
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,852
The noon meal is already over.

70
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,516
Who sent you? That lieutenant?

71
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:23,889
No ma'am, sergeant Hennessy.

72
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,636
Well, clear a place
for yourself at the table.

73
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,416
There's some dishes in the
kitchen and beans in the pot.

74
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,356
The door over there.

75
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:50,529
Hold still.

76
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,916
- A cup.
- We got plenty of cups.

77
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,583
And two plates.

78
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,490
- Well, I think that looks all right.
- I think it's beautiful.

79
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,543
You find beans all right?

80
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:33,606
- But you didn't get any coffee.
- I'll get it for him Ma.

81
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:52,717
There you are, mister...

82
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:55,877
- Jones, Seven Jones.
- I'm Joy Karrington.

83
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:59,010
Ma, his name is Seven Jones.

84
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:01,196
- Pleased to meet you ma'am.
- Sit down.

85
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:02,663
Go and eat.

86
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:07,043
I'll get the hot water started and you
bring the rest of the dishes, will you dear?

87
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,063
- It's nice dog.
- His name is Apache.

88
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:17,743
Apache?

89
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,040
Well, it's no funnier name than you've got.

90
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,864
No I, I guess not.
Just wait till you heard the rest of it.

91
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,040
You see, my Pa wasn't much for fancy
when it came to giving out names, so...

92
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:30,837
he just named us by
the numbers and let it go at that.

93
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,997
Plain number is not much of a name.

94
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:37,798
That's what my ma said too,
so we always used to add something like...

95
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:41,464
the firstborn was One for the Money Jones...

96
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:45,931
the second was Two for the
Show Jones and and right on up to me.

97
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:51,317
My full name is
Seven Ways From Sundown Jones.

98
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,438
Well.

99
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,624
- You're new on the Rangers.
- Yes ma'am.

100
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:58,264
How you come to join?

101
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,612
Well, mostly was on account
of my older brother, Two Jones.

102
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:06,531
- He got killed working for the Rangers.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:11,331
That was a real
pretty dress you were trying on.

104
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,917
For the Fultons' barn
raising tonight, are you going?

105
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,117
Oh, I don't know and I haven't been asked.

106
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:22,020
Well, the Fultons
will be real glad to have you.

107
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,463
Well, maybe.

108
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,397
Oh, I'll get you some pie.

109
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,837
- We ain't that hard up for men Herly.
- That's for me to say sergeant.

110
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:38,267
You know as well as me
what kind of man Flood is.

111
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,218
I ought to be taking a whole
company instead of one new man.

112
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,069
Jones has got to pull his own weight.

113
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:45,025
You saw how he handled the gun...

114
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,172
me and him taking on
Jim Flood would be downright suicide.

115
00:11:48,744 --> 00:11:51,517
You're taking Jones
sergeant, and that's that.

116
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,564
Hennessy.

117
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,915
You don't think I like
making that choice, do you?

118
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,269
But I got men scattered over half of Texas.

119
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:12,349
I need at least five men down in the south
plateau, four men covering the Baker place...

120
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,725
and I can't send Duncan or Hollis.

121
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,985
Most of those men are protecting cows.

122
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:20,165
Is saving a few head of cattle
more important than a man's life?

123
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,559
He joined up, didn't he?
Let him earn his pay.

124
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,548
He don't seem to know Flood
was in on the killing of his brother...

125
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,749
but finding out might make him
act even more foolish than normal.

126
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,359
I'd say he'd be the last man to send.

127
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,693
Stay Apache, stay here boy, stay.

128
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,785
Apache.

129
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:06,558
Apache, there.
There's a good dog, it's all right.

130
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:09,491
There, there now.

131
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:14,024
Well, just maybe he might
not be the last man to send.

132
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:33,212
How come you can't handle a six-shooter?

133
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:39,598
Us Joneses never had too much spare cash, I
never could afford one of them revolving gun.

134
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,142
When word gets back in the morning about...

135
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:48,543
Flood, you and me
is going to take out after him.

136
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:49,565
Good.

137
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:55,245
Say, your brother ever mention
anything about working for Herly?

138
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,858
No, Two wasn't much for writing.

139
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:01,908
I'm glad I'm going with you sergeant.

140
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:07,164
Well, maybe along the way
I can teach you about using a sidearm.

141
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,964
I'd be obliged to you.

142
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,684
Jones? You're staying here
tonight, keep an eye in the office.

143
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:22,257
Yes, sir.

144
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:25,071
First barn raising I've been to in a year.

145
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,657
Lots of girls and lots of whiskey,
both are fun and both are risky.

146
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:33,310
Hey. Wait for me.

147
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,690
Come on Shorty,
we can't keep the women waiting.

148
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,339
Yeah, all the
good looking ones will be picked.

149
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,152
You sure smell pretty Shorty.

150
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:42,782
Yeah, he smells like he climbed out
of a jug of that fancy flowery water.

151
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,647
- Let them rip.
- Come on.

152
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,451
Gal in one hand and a jug in the other.

153
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,529
Maybe I should take the duty Seven.

154
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:29,055
Wouldn't want you
half asleep when we take off.

155
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,475
I'm all right.

156
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,288
- Hennessy.
- Yeah?

157
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:38,942
You said you knew my brother,
how did he come to get killed?

158
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,476
Well, I don't know much about it.

159
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:45,295
- Some fracas down in the Big Bend country.
- Yeah, I know that.

160
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,562
If you should get sleepy, I'll take over.

161
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:50,624
Thanks.

162
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,410
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

163
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,889
You don't want sit down?

164
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:32,519
I thought you went to the barn raising.

165
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,930
Oh, oh, we, we did but...

166
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:41,116
Well, Ma wasn't feeling
so well, so we, we left early.

167
00:16:47,143 --> 00:16:48,689
That's too bad.

168
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,862
They said it was you and
Hennessy going out after Jim Flood.

169
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:56,782
That's right, sergeant Hennessy and me.

170
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:01,368
From the stories I've heard about him,
Flood must be 20 feet tall.

171
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:04,555
- Don't you worry about that.
- Well...

172
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:09,715
It's just that, well, Ma and me we...

173
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:13,341
we wouldn't want to have anything
bad happen to sergeant Hennessy...

174
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:19,902
- But why should it be you going with him?
- Why not? I'm a Ranger.

175
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:22,009
Yes, but you're so new.

176
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:26,046
Yes I am but the sergeant is
going to teach me as we go along.

177
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:30,066
Maybe he'll be able to keep me from
getting killed for the first day or two.

178
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:34,543
Oh, it's just...

179
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:41,636
Well, Ma sure thinks an awful lot of you,
the way you saved the pup today and all...

180
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:46,983
Well, she liked you right away
from the first time she saw you.

181
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:55,956
Yeah well, I sure like her too.
She's nice, all right.

182
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:02,956
Look, it isn't as if it's going
to be my last night on earth.

183
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:09,370
I wish you good luck.

184
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,238
Well, report is Flood is still heading north.

185
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:26,198
Likely pick up his
trail around Sterling City.

186
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,424
That far up? He sure gets
a lot of distance out of a horse.

187
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:33,558
Doing the impossible is
just everyday living for Flood.

188
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:36,007
I'll check us out, be right back.

189
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:44,211
- Oh, fine morning Miss Joy.
- Yes, sure is fine.

190
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:50,010
- How's your Ma this morning?
- Oh, she's much improved today, thank you.

191
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:56,117
She was, saying how too bad we didn't
get to know you longer than just one day.

192
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,797
Well I...

193
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:02,191
I'd sure like to be able to, to write you
a letter sometime, if I'm gone that long.

194
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:05,952
- You think it'd be all right?
- Oh, I'd like that, so would Ma.

195
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:10,358
Oh, I brought you
a little food to take along.

196
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,780
It's always nice to have a little extra food.

197
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,578
Oh, it's a cake.

198
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:29,183
It's a real beautiful cake, about the
nicest thing anyone ever did for me.

199
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,796
You take good care of yourself Seven.

200
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:36,329
- I'll come back to see you.
- Morning Joy.

201
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:51,436
Cake.

202
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:39,102
Hey.

203
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:41,879
That's two times out of four...

204
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,830
you hit good and close today,
you're getting the hang of it.

205
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,095
Doesn't look like we ever
going to catch up with Flood.

206
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,242
Should pull into Sterling late today.

207
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,329
Knowing Flood, you figure he still be there?

208
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,196
Knowing Jim?

209
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,280
The only thing a man can know about
what Jim is going to do is that he'll...

210
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:00,891
darn sure never know.

211
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:04,743
- Kind of full of surprises, eh?
- Yeah.

212
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,050
- Nothing, eh?
- No.

213
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:28,490
- Any other suggestions?
- Yeah, let's have a drink.

214
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,142
Hello, boys.

215
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,542
- Evening miss...
- Lucinda.

216
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:28,135
- How about a drink?
- Couple of whiskeys.

217
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:32,135
- And get whatever you'd like for yourself.
- Thank you.

218
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:36,268
Joe? Two whiskeys.

219
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:44,631
Bet this is the only town in Texas
where nobody ever heard of Jim Flood.

220
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:46,349
They've heard of him all right.

221
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:51,081
He's been here and gone.
Left them all dizzy with his blasted charm.

222
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:54,468
There's not many places
left to look for him around here.

223
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:17,060
- What you boys do?
- A little of everything.

224
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:21,860
- Well, I heard you're looking for Jim Flood.
- Might be.

225
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,176
What you want with him?

226
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,629
That ain't anybody's
business but Jim's and ours.

227
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:34,562
- A man like that has a lot of enemies.
- Jim can take care of his enemies.

228
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:41,317
- It's true, you're not the law.
- Do I look it?

229
00:23:41,722 --> 00:23:45,122
You don't. He does, kind of.

230
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,042
Except he's young.

231
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:51,255
His honest looks come in handy sometimes.

232
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:56,322
If you're still doubtful, I don't suppose
a lawman would know the particular place...

233
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:59,614
Flood has a burn scar, shaped like an X.

234
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:04,814
Yeah, well, how do you know about that?

235
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:09,481
Because me, accidentally branded him
one time, one time when we was drunk.

236
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,988
If...

237
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:21,868
If I do tell you where he went, will you,
will you give him a message for me?

238
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:23,828
Fair enough.

239
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:30,322
He left day before yesterday,
he's headed north towards Big Spring.

240
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:35,761
Will you tell him that, that Lucinda
loves him and, and to please come back?

241
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:38,989
Or to let me know
where he is so I can go to him.

242
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:40,375
We'll tell him.

243
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,882
- I sure wish the best for you ma'am.
- Oh no, the, the drinks are on the house.

244
00:24:50,216 --> 00:24:53,696
- Well, thank you.
- You won't forget?

245
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,122
Not a chance.

246
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,028
- We're not headed north.
- No.

247
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:12,228
How come?

248
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:15,095
Flood didn't go south
because we come up that way.

249
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:18,261
He didn't go east
because is nothing out there.

250
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:22,462
That pretty much leaves west, the way we're
traveling, out toward the Llano Estacado.

251
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:24,850
What about north like the girl said?

252
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:29,164
Flood never in his life told a girl
the right direction he was going.

253
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:44,466
You really think we can make
money off the lake Mr. Flood?

254
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:45,158
Sure.

255
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:49,132
After we stock it with sturgeon, we can
make a million dollars selling caviar.

256
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,373
What's that?

257
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:53,637
Well, it's a fancy food the
crowned heads of Europe swear by it.

258
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,071
Crowned heads?

259
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:58,723
You know, kings and queens,
lords and ladies, czars and czarinas.

260
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:02,371
Them people sure must've
a great time of it, ain't it mister?

261
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:06,347
Most of them would like to
change places with us right now.

262
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,054
- They would?
- You betcha.

263
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:11,025
Taking life easy is one
of the delights of the world.

264
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,537
Guess so.

265
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:15,594
Gee, that sure is
a mighty pretty folding knife.

266
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,345
You like the idea of us
stocking the lake with sturgeons?

267
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,594
Sure do, I'd like to go
partners with you anytime.

268
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:26,088
Well, just maybe we'll
do her one of these days.

269
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:30,827
I've been living right over there,
in part of this canyon, my whole life...

270
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:34,339
and nobody ever had
that idea before, they're just farmers.

271
00:26:35,184 --> 00:26:37,034
Well, farming is fine if you like it.

272
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:42,532
Me, I'd rather do something I like and go
bust than succeed at doing something dull.

273
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:46,081
Yeah, makes you feel like...

274
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:50,297
- That life has a kind of magic in it.
- Yeah.

275
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:55,834
Say, would you take another
look at the flats behind us there?

276
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,097
Sure.

277
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:01,945
Still don't see nothing.

278
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:05,810
Out toward the peaks, way back, look high.

279
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:10,479
Yeah, there's a speck of dust way out there.

280
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,926
People sure can be a nuisance sometimes.

281
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:16,289
- You in a spot?
- What, me?

282
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:19,714
They're going to be in
trouble if they don't quit following me.

283
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:23,248
- You might tell them that.
- All right. I'll sure tell them.

284
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,027
On stocking the lake.
We just might do it one of these days.

285
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:32,759
- Mr. Flood?
- Yeah?

286
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,639
You forgot your folding knife.

287
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,339
You know, that's much too nice a knife
for a fellow like me to be careless with it.

288
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,505
You better take care of it for me.

289
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,985
Gee, thanks.

290
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,067
- So long Jody.
- Goodbye Mr. Flood.

291
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,653
Seven.

292
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,386
- Flood?
- No doubt about it.

293
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:33,466
Smoked these ever since he is a kid.

294
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:36,585
About a day ahead, I'd say.

295
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,599
You seem to know him real good.

296
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:43,132
Nobody knows Jim Flood real good.

297
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,945
But when we young fellas,
we did spend some time together.

298
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,918
- That so?
- Yeah.

299
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:57,385
He could always beat us others at
anything, cards, women, guns...

300
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,839
Never even seemed to try hard.

301
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,973
How come he wound up an outlaw?

302
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,279
Well, some people say he just never grew up.

303
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:16,759
To him, this world is kind of a circus and
4th of July celebration all rolled into one.

304
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,585
That's why he was trouble, people say.

305
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,759
And it's also why they
usually loved him, at first sight.

306
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,882
You seem to think a fair amount of him too.

307
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:31,679
Yeah, in a way.

308
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:38,399
When you see the kind of a fella he is,
you got to forgive him a lot of things.

309
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:45,066
It's not for us to judge
him one way or the other.

310
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,105
I want you to remember that.

311
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,759
I'll remember.

312
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,346
- One thing I know for sure about him.
- Yeah?

313
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:59,119
He seems to just loaf along
and rides about a thousand miles a day.

314
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:02,598
Sooner or later we'll
come up with him, hey...

315
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:23,451
You see a stranger around here lately?

316
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,598
Not for six or eight months.

317
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:33,877
You've been making these horse tracks
and munching that grass there yourself?

318
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:38,358
He said for you not to follow him no more.

319
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:44,624
- Don't suppose you know which way he went.
- Didn't rightly notice mister.

320
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,411
See what I mean about Flood?

321
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,823
Stay down.

322
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:37,156
I should've known, was going too easy.

323
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:40,969
Hennessy?

324
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:46,675
Remember what I told you,
it ain't up to us to judge Flood.

325
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,316
I'm giving you an order.

326
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:55,315
You head right back for Texas.
Promise me you won't go after him yourself.

327
00:31:55,555 --> 00:31:58,455
Not going anywhere by
myself, you're going to be all right.

328
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,880
Promise me.

329
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:05,328
You sure are stubborn.

330
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:53,526
Where's my hat?

331
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,883
You one of those two fellas been trailing me?

332
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,246
That's right.

333
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:05,633
If you're going to shoot, I'd wish you'd
get it over with, the suspense is awful.

334
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,072
Hold it.

335
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:17,962
That's the last one, you want it?

336
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,592
You pretty good shot.

337
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,772
- It's a pretty bad hole.
- Doesn't look too bad to me.

338
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:43,371
- What are our plans?
- I'm taking you back to Texas.

339
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,584
I imagine they'll hang you.

340
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:50,651
Well, in the meantime would you
be good enough to toss me my hat?

341
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:52,717
Get it yourself.

342
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,480
Looks like you'll have
to carry me all the way to Texas.

343
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:19,771
- That won't stop me.
- Can't get far.

344
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,117
I tell you, I'm bleeding to death.

345
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:25,825
All right, we'll stay right
here till that bleeding stops.

346
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:28,732
- Sit down.
- There's a better place close by.

347
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:31,213
- Where?
- Cabin of mine.

348
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
Let's go.

349
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,560
After all I did get shot.

350
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,293
That cabin of mine is
just a short way up ahead.

351
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:54,069
I'm telling you this because
I'm just about to pass out.

352
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,740
You pass out and I'll
let you lay here and die.

353
00:36:58,066 --> 00:36:59,706
This is kind of embarrassing.

354
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:33,199
- I got any blood left?
- I don't know.

355
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,812
- You cutting me open to see?
- I got to probe for that bullet.

356
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:43,732
Way you look right now, you're
more likely to stab me to death.

357
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:46,559
Why don't you shut up.

358
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,135
Honest...

359
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,361
real nice of you,
leave me out there to die after all.

360
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:17,335
Well, I should've,
after what you did to Hennessy.

361
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,269
- Hennessy?
- Sergeant Hennessy, Texas Rangers.

362
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:26,388
Man you shot back there.

363
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:32,482
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

364
00:38:33,442 --> 00:38:35,442
Who cares how you feel?

365
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,815
- What's your name?
- Jones.

366
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:46,882
Jones, you're a nice, likable young fella.

367
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:53,028
You look real close, you'll see a small
scar, right at the top of my forehead.

368
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,482
A Comanche put it there
when he started to scalp me...

369
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:01,149
15 years ago.

370
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,109
Was Hennessy who stopped him.

371
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:12,309
Let's not bring Hennessy up again.

372
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:40,694
Still here.

373
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:51,028
Couple pieces of beef and I'll
feel good as new, how about you?

374
00:39:51,574 --> 00:39:52,894
I'm fine.

375
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,974
There's food aplenty out there in the pantry.

376
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,427
I found it.

377
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:02,360
There's a lean-to out back for the horses.

378
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:04,934
- Feed out there too.
- I found it.

379
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:09,001
I found that too.

380
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,950
That's the only piece
of artillery in the place.

381
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:17,426
If you'd asked me where it was, I'd told you.

382
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:18,427
I'll bet.

383
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,319
Well, I might as well get a fire started.

384
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:26,707
I'll go feed the horses,
you know how to cook?

385
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:32,347
All the chefs in New Orleans slink away
in shame when my name is mentioned.

386
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,000
Yeah.

387
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,001
Steak and beans for supper.

388
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:46,094
Now, this six-gun has
what you might call a hair trigger.

389
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:49,373
Don't put that fork
down too heavy, it might go off.

390
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:53,791
They're sure teaching you young
Rangers to be cautious nowadays.

391
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,187
Let me have your plate.

392
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:05,280
- I noticed some rat poison in the pantry.
- Jones?

393
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,108
Your cutting knife.

394
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:19,228
Is it all right that we eat now?

395
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,521
Yeah.

396
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,281
You're an incessant talker, aren't you?

397
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:43,228
I talk when there's something to say.

398
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:48,387
Tell me something...

399
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:52,067
why did they send an inexperienced
young fella like you after me?

400
00:42:53,494 --> 00:42:57,108
It's kind of insulting,
nothing personal, of course.

401
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,067
I got you, haven't I?

402
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:03,721
Well, in a way, yes.

403
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:06,417
But the only reason I haven't killed you
is because you're a friend of Hennessy's...

404
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,135
and you're a likable young fellow.

405
00:43:08,348 --> 00:43:10,998
- There's some pickles in the pantry.
- I'll get them.

406
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,424
Think pretty high of yourself, don't you?

407
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,254
Kill me?

408
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:25,519
You see what I mean?

409
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:34,853
When you were watching me through the
window there, you didn't watch long enough.

410
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:39,693
- Well, from now on I'll be more careful.
- I should hope so.

411
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:57,614
- You a gambling man?
- Sometime.

412
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:03,681
- Want to play a little stud or draw?
- I got a hunch you ain't honest.

413
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:09,894
Well, let's just say I'm not easy to beat.

414
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:17,187
- What should we play for?
- Fun?

415
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,507
All right money, pennies.

416
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,147
- You sure are a plunger.
- Look, I only make 26 dollars a month.

417
00:44:33,187 --> 00:44:35,947
I'll get some beans,
each bean will be worth one penny.

418
00:44:38,346 --> 00:44:41,200
Well, I guess it's
better than playing solitaire.

419
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:24,310
- Call.
- Jacks, three of them.

420
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:27,829
Beats two pair.

421
00:45:28,883 --> 00:45:34,229
- How much is that altogether?
- Let's see now, that makes 62 dollars.

422
00:45:35,802 --> 00:45:38,229
Better than two month's
wages gone in one night.

423
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:40,509
You'll have to wait a while to get paid.

424
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,934
- Thing to do is try to win it back.
- No.

425
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:46,716
We're leaving here first thing in the
morning, it's time to get some sleep.

426
00:45:46,717 --> 00:45:49,469
- You figured out how to do that?
- Yeah.

427
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,599
You're sleeping in the pantry,
there's room on the floor..

428
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:54,775
I suspected as much.

429
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:03,802
Good night.

430
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:25,080
- Say, Flood.
- Yeah?

431
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:29,444
I've been thinking about
you not hitting me with that poker.

432
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,093
You miss me on purpose?

433
00:46:33,414 --> 00:46:35,534
It's a stupid question Jones.

434
00:46:37,667 --> 00:46:41,121
Yeah well, the thing is I, Well...

435
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:45,698
- You trying to thank me kid?
- No, I'm not.

436
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,107
- Don't call me kid either, my name is Seven.
- What?

437
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,346
Seven Ways from Sundown Jones.

438
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,200
Well, we all have a cross to bear.

439
00:46:58,133 --> 00:46:59,133
Night.

440
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:18,893
I wish you weren't so set on going all the
way back to Texas, I kind of like it here.

441
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:20,444
Well, that's where we're going.

442
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,809
You're an easy cuss to
get along with, I sort

443
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:25,010
of hate to hurt you so
I'll go along a ways.

444
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,666
But I'm not going to jail
in Buckley, let's make that clear, eh?

445
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,587
I'll take two.

446
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,240
- Twenty cents.
- I call that.

447
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,120
- Three jacks.
- Straight.

448
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:41,547
You sure you're not cheating?

449
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,454
All right, I'm going to
teach you something Seven.

450
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,080
- See the back of that card?
- You using a marked deck?

451
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:58,907
I still don't feel like going back to Texas.

452
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:02,720
Just the same, come daylight
you better be ready to ride.

453
00:49:03,601 --> 00:49:05,651
Can't beat you young fellas for optimism.

454
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:09,681
Seems to me I ought to have a
strong vote in what we do just now.

455
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,614
- Hennessy said you was full of tricks.
- Yeah.

456
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:16,361
So I took the trouble to unload that six-gun.

457
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,210
You know, I'm beginning to think
that you and me ought to be partners.

458
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:29,773
- Game is over.
- Yeah.

459
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:34,013
You, owe me 86 dollars.

460
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,159
Turn around and I'll tie you up.

461
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:41,905
Right at.

462
00:50:34,704 --> 00:50:36,370
Thought maybe I busted your head.

463
00:50:37,637 --> 00:50:40,624
Speaking of heads, you
got the hardest one I ever saw.

464
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,250
Last fellow I walloped
like that was out for three hours.

465
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,103
I was out long enough.
You could have shot me.

466
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:49,769
This rope is kind of tight.

467
00:50:51,063 --> 00:50:53,263
How long you figuring on keeping me tied up?

468
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:55,476
All the way back to Texas.

469
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:19,937
You sure you wouldn't rather
go to California instead of Texas?

470
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:21,984
Texas.

471
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:24,498
The least you can do
is let me choose my route.

472
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,649
There's a couple of girls
I'd kind of like to see along the way.

473
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,797
This is not exactly a sightseeing trip.

474
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:32,345
It's a long way, least we can do is enjoy it.

475
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:06,947
Say Seven, I don't
know whether you know it or not...

476
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:09,148
but I think we might be in a little trouble.

477
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:13,171
- What kind of trouble?
- Apaches, I suspect.

478
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,189
We've been traveling
on some of their sacred ground.

479
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,938
I know it might seem
foolish from your point of view...

480
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:26,829
but I'd suggest that you
untie me and give me my gun.

481
00:52:26,997 --> 00:52:29,547
If they are Apaches
you're still going to stay tied.

482
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:33,153
I'd suggest strongly that you
give me something to shoot with.

483
00:52:33,637 --> 00:52:38,090
- You got any other suggestions?
- Yeah, come on.

484
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:02,543
We got some other visitors over here.

485
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:10,347
How you going to fight
them off from both sides at once?

486
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:13,718
I don't know, but is a lot
better than having to fight you too.

487
00:53:16,637 --> 00:53:18,987
I thought Indians
always did a lot of hollering.

488
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:22,543
They only do that mainly when
they're trying to build up their nerve.

489
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:25,486
They don't think they got
any particular problem here.

490
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,396
You keep watching that side.

491
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:00,824
Looks like they're
planning on joining the merriment.

492
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,811
Well, we're not waiting for that.
Get on your horse.

493
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,292
I'd argue with you, only it's
better than waiting around here all day.

494
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,293
Of all the lousy, rotten luck, a single shot.

495
00:54:40,613 --> 00:54:42,333
Where you get that rifle?

496
00:54:45,186 --> 00:54:46,346
Look at them run.

497
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:49,049
I guess they decided to do something easy...

498
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,000
like attack an army fort
rather than tangle with you and me.

499
00:54:52,406 --> 00:54:56,456
You know, if you had untied my hands they
might have thought they were surrounded.

500
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,427
Let's get out of here.

501
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:38,547
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

502
00:55:41,803 --> 00:55:46,879
You know, I think I had to face life without
cigars, whiskey, women, steak and cards...

503
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:49,574
I'd much rather they
take me out, string me up.

504
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:54,285
There's an unpleasant thought, getting hung.

505
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,019
The word is hanged.

506
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:00,175
Which is what ain't going to happen to me.

507
00:56:00,948 --> 00:56:04,398
I've been shot 11 times, broke
out of more jails than you can count...

508
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:08,389
had a rope around my neck
twice, so don't worry about me..

509
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:10,657
I won't.

510
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:16,992
I'm still trying to figure out how
they sent just you and Hennessy after me.

511
00:56:18,129 --> 00:56:23,133
- Your boss got something against you?
- Heck no, Herly is just short of men.

512
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:30,455
Herly? That's just like the Rangers, always
short of something, men, money or brains.

513
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:35,606
You know Jones, you could've a lot more fun
if you'd quit the Rangers, join up with me.

514
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,780
I got a kind of calling.

515
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,880
One my brothers was killed with the Rangers.

516
00:56:44,162 --> 00:56:46,062
That's a darn shame.

517
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:50,370
- Last spring, down the Big Bend country.
- Last spring?

518
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:53,222
Yeap, April.

519
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:59,209
Your brother, he, he look anything like you?

520
00:57:01,077 --> 00:57:03,612
I guess so, taller maybe.

521
00:57:09,868 --> 00:57:11,569
I kind of liked old Two.

522
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:15,689
Seems to me I heard
something about that scrap.

523
00:57:17,056 --> 00:57:19,806
Way I heard it, that ranger
wouldn't have gotten shot...

524
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:21,887
another ranger hadn't ducked out on him.

525
00:57:22,602 --> 00:57:23,602
How do you mean?

526
00:57:23,603 --> 00:57:27,453
Well, the way I heard it another lawman
was supposed to be covering for him...

527
00:57:27,454 --> 00:57:29,905
but he hid behind
a rock, never showed himself.

528
00:57:31,432 --> 00:57:36,477
- Seems to me it was the ranger's fault.
- What else do you know about it?

529
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:38,972
Nothing.

530
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:42,869
Nothing at all, just
picked that story up in El Paso.

531
00:57:44,538 --> 00:57:47,153
In any case, I sure I'm
sorry about your brother.

532
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:54,759
Going to get some sleep.

533
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:17,044
Well, what will it be, Sterling or Hobbs?

534
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,779
I don't want to go into a town
where there'll be a lot of fuss.

535
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,530
Just want to pick up some
supplies and wire the Rangers.

536
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:27,049
Then my suggestion would be to
head on over towards Sterling.

537
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:31,789
I thought it would be.
I met your girl Lucinda the other day.

538
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:36,553
- Everyone in town kind of likes you.
- Well, I guess it'll have to be Hobbs then.

539
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:40,811
You think we can get our supplies
without a mob coming out to lynch you?

540
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,428
We might even stop off
for a quiet drink or two.

541
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:57,656
Now that you wired the Rangers,
and before we go shopping and you...

542
00:58:57,657 --> 00:58:59,872
suppose we could have that quiet drink?

543
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:02,721
I guess one drink wouldn't hurt.

544
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:07,634
Oh, Howdy Jim.

545
00:59:10,954 --> 00:59:13,354
And it was your suggestion
we go to Sterling, eh?

546
00:59:13,355 --> 00:59:15,455
Was your decision to come to Hobbs, Jones.

547
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:18,531
- Say, how in blazes you get tied up?
- Well, let's untie him.

548
00:59:18,532 --> 00:59:19,532
Hold it.

549
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:21,009
Jim.

550
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:25,087
- Oh, who tied you up?
- Meet Seven Jones, Gilda.

551
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,949
Maybe we ought to drop
this Jones down a well.

552
00:59:27,979 --> 00:59:30,540
Oh, no, no Sam, don't tangle
with him, he's tougher than he looks.

553
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,541
We ain't going to let him take you away.

554
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:33,927
- Right?
- Right.

555
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:37,230
Hold down everybody, we don't
want to get each other banged up.

556
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:40,476
I'm sure Mr. Jones wouldn't mind
if we all has a sociable drink.

557
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,551
You give me your word
you won't try to get away?

558
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:46,679
You think my word is any good?

559
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:49,871
- Yeah, I do.
- You got it.

560
00:59:51,408 --> 00:59:54,013
- All right.
- You sure are a trusting soul.

561
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,703
First drinks are on the house, come on boys.

562
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:01,890
Sit down here Jim.

563
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:04,341
Make yourself at
home Jones, you're among friends.

564
01:00:04,342 --> 01:00:06,492
- There you are, the good stuff.
- Good boy.

565
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,602
- Fill us in on what you been doing Jim.
- Oh, staying sober mostly...

566
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:12,265
keeping out of trouble.

567
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:16,420
- What do we drink to?
- Let's drink to Seven Jones...

568
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:19,473
the only man I ever hit who didn't stay down.

569
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,226
To Seven Jones.

570
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:30,446
If Seven here would be willing to turn his
back long enough for us to cut those ropes...

571
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,543
between all of us here, we'd give
him enough money to retire.

572
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:38,669
What I've been wondering Flood, is
what is it you ever did for this town.

573
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:42,734
- He's just him, that's all.
- Town comes to life when he's here.

574
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:47,325
You know, he's, he's what every
man would like to be but never is.

575
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,205
Nobody will ever tame him.

576
01:00:49,235 --> 01:00:53,730
And what's more, he's never gone on a rampage
in this town, which is sort of a help.

577
01:01:03,595 --> 01:01:05,068
How are you, Jim?

578
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:07,731
Maybe you ladies
would like to rejoin us later?

579
01:01:08,506 --> 01:01:09,506
Sure.

580
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:16,683
You fellas got something on your mind?

581
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:19,810
Word come that Flood was here.

582
01:01:20,675 --> 01:01:23,472
Flood is worth $6,000, dead or alive.

583
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:26,088
Word also came he was tied up.

584
01:01:26,237 --> 01:01:28,987
Or you two bounty hunters
would be running like rabbits.

585
01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:31,937
Pay no heed Dick.

586
01:01:34,008 --> 01:01:38,417
You're a Texas Ranger
young fella, on New Mexico soil.

587
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:40,221
You know the law?

588
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,424
- No.
- But he upholds it anyhow.

589
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:47,672
We got us duly constituted
authority here, you ain't.

590
01:01:48,195 --> 01:01:52,369
You got to turn him over to us.
We'll guarantee he won't get away.

591
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:59,436
- I don't like your looks mister, sorry.
- Maybe we'll have to shoot you too kid.

592
01:02:02,746 --> 01:02:06,055
Of course, we'd be willing to
make a deal about the reward money.

593
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:09,376
That's about far enough.

594
01:02:10,656 --> 01:02:12,856
I got a gun aimed right at your belt buckle.

595
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,303
- He's bluffing.
- I reckon.

596
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:21,841
And he's defending Flood, which
means he's going against the law.

597
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:25,040
Get him.

598
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:31,601
Put it on the bar.

599
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,253
Now finish that quiet drink of yours.

600
01:02:42,617 --> 01:02:45,617
Why don't you just shoot him
and let's get on with the party?

601
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:49,022
Let's get out of here.

602
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:02,041
You get any idea
about following us, forget it.

603
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,938
I'll untie Flood and give him a gun.

604
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:14,691
That was an interesting
break in the monotony last night.

605
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:18,453
If you only had the sense
to take my advice, we'd still be there.

606
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:20,904
Little girl who kept
eying you was kind of pretty.

607
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:24,866
- There's one I like better back in Buckley.
- No reason not to like them all.

608
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:28,033
Maybe if I get to stay in Buckley
long enough, I'll meet her.

609
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:29,166
See if I approve.

610
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:32,657
- You'll have plenty of time.
- Nope.

611
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:36,350
You keep forgetting.
I said I'm not going to jail.

612
01:03:39,158 --> 01:03:41,258
You know, we never did get those supplies.

613
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,912
All we need is some meat and
flour and some horseshoe nails.

614
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,965
- We can make do.
- What about cigars?

615
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:51,206
Well, is a tragedy I can't
even stand thinking about.

616
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,900
The problem is we're headed toward
the Pecos country over toward Devil's River.

617
01:03:56,014 --> 01:03:58,364
Not many towns there
I'm on friendly terms with.

618
01:03:59,632 --> 01:04:00,977
I'm glad to hear that.

619
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:06,443
You know Jonesy, you'd brave
as a lion, holding off them bounty hunters.

620
01:04:33,314 --> 01:04:35,664
Maybe we can get the
supplies we need from them.

621
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:39,078
I'd give my right arm for a cigar.

622
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:11,276
- Afternoon.
- What do you want?

623
01:05:11,426 --> 01:05:13,726
We need some supplies,
if you let us have them.

624
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,727
- Like what?
- Hey, that's Jim Flood.

625
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:20,233
Sure it is, I've seen him in El Paso.

626
01:05:21,204 --> 01:05:25,400
I'm taking him in, we don't
want any trouble, just some supplies.

627
01:05:25,912 --> 01:05:28,812
That's the man Jake Hanley
and his bunch was looking for...

628
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:31,063
and he'll pay plenty to lay his hands on him.

629
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:35,563
- I said I'm taking him in.
- Sure, son.

630
01:05:35,691 --> 01:05:39,276
Hanley pay half a year's
wages for him and he's tied up.

631
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:40,782
Shut up.

632
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,116
This man is the law and
we ain't going against the law.

633
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:47,196
Now that we've got that settled...

634
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:51,730
what we need is flour and beans
and horseshoe nails if you could spare them.

635
01:05:52,543 --> 01:05:54,130
Get him some Joe.

636
01:06:28,112 --> 01:06:29,808
Hah. Hah.

637
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:32,113
Get out of here. Hah. Hah.

638
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,834
Hey, look at this.

639
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:45,234
Seven, when I pass on to glory, my one wish
will be to go with a pocket full of cigars.

640
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:48,914
Where I'm going there'll
be no problem lighting them.

641
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:53,660
Hey, who is that Jake Hanley
they were talking about?

642
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:57,234
Hanley? Him and his
friends are undoubtedly the meanest...

643
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,753
bunch of gunslingers in the entire Southwest.

644
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,800
And you, a Ranger, never heard of him?

645
01:07:02,007 --> 01:07:03,273
What he got against you?

646
01:07:03,462 --> 01:07:05,712
All sorts of things, too numerous to mention.

647
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:08,813
Had a dispute with some of
his brothers one time, for instance.

648
01:07:09,014 --> 01:07:11,814
They the same Hanleys
you shot back at Beeker's Crossing?

649
01:07:11,815 --> 01:07:12,815
Yeah.

650
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,360
No wonder he's out to get you.

651
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:17,851
They're just one, big, mean
family and Jake is the last of them.

652
01:07:19,673 --> 01:07:22,173
We may as well
help ourselves to the stuff we need.

653
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:24,124
That's the way I like to hear you talk.

654
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,440
You know, you'd make a fair to middle badman
if you ever gave yourself half the chance.

655
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,713
You ever think about it?

656
01:07:31,993 --> 01:07:34,393
- About what?
- Being an outlaw.

657
01:07:34,686 --> 01:07:37,086
Having the sheer pleasure
of throwing in with me.

658
01:07:37,169 --> 01:07:41,119
Together we could pick up the entire
Southwest and shake it like a pair of dice.

659
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,240
Come up with a lucky seven every time.

660
01:07:43,535 --> 01:07:45,319
Nope, never thought about it.

661
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:48,434
Well, think about it.

662
01:07:54,424 --> 01:07:57,360
Hey, look at this, some bacon.

663
01:08:12,575 --> 01:08:14,675
Those peaks are starting to look familiar.

664
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:17,603
We ought to be in Buckley
about tomorrow night, I'd say.

665
01:08:17,604 --> 01:08:20,464
- We make it to Buckley.
- Eh?

666
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:25,877
Look Seven, if we run into that Hanley
bunch, don't try too hard to hold on to me.

667
01:08:56,357 --> 01:08:57,970
- Hanley?
- Yeah.

668
01:08:58,263 --> 01:08:59,890
Let him take me Seven.

669
01:09:00,783 --> 01:09:03,463
No use of us both
getting killed, get out of the way.

670
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,569
I'm not standing by and let you
get shot, you're my prisoner.

671
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:13,395
Don't do it.

672
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:26,489
Let's not have a big fracas.
I'll just go along with you fellows.

673
01:09:27,008 --> 01:09:30,062
- Good.
- Nobody is taking him Hanley.

674
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,649
Better get out of here kid.

675
01:10:10,435 --> 01:10:11,688
Hey Jonesy.

676
01:10:19,742 --> 01:10:20,755
Thanks.

677
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:46,501
- Buckley, eh?
- Yeap.

678
01:10:46,874 --> 01:10:48,434
You made it Seven.

679
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:52,458
Now I kind of like to get out
of here without hurting you.

680
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,647
Don't worry about it.

681
01:11:22,181 --> 01:11:23,634
It's Flood.

682
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,347
That's Flood.

683
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,200
Get down.

684
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,697
Lieutenant, this here is Jim Flood.

685
01:12:00,867 --> 01:12:03,253
Lieutenant, seems to me we met someplace.

686
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:09,733
- Fogarty, lock him up.
- I'll see you later Seven.

687
01:12:17,372 --> 01:12:18,599
All right Jones.

688
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:21,878
- Jones.
- Yes sir?

689
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:25,561
Write up a report. I want details
on Hennessy and bringing in Flood.

690
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:27,075
Give it to me in the morning.

691
01:12:30,438 --> 01:12:31,788
Here, I'll take them Seven.

692
01:12:33,452 --> 01:12:36,225
Boy, that sure was
something, bringing in Jim Flood.

693
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:38,025
Yeah.

694
01:12:42,786 --> 01:12:44,132
Seven.

695
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:50,866
- Hello.
- You look tired.

696
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:55,453
- I am a little.
- Can I fix you some coffee?

697
01:12:57,066 --> 01:12:58,306
I'd like that.

698
01:13:04,266 --> 01:13:06,892
Let's see now,
after I left Beeker's Crossing...

699
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:11,452
All right Fred, you've got your
story, that's enough for tonight.

700
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:14,548
You shouldn't have thrown that newspaper
fella out. I could have held him...

701
01:13:14,549 --> 01:13:16,452
spellbound for another hour or so.

702
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,560
But then doubtless, you wanted
to have a word with me in private, eh?

703
01:13:20,561 --> 01:13:22,066
I got nothing to say to you.

704
01:13:22,293 --> 01:13:23,843
The service here is deplorable.

705
01:13:24,056 --> 01:13:26,856
You save hanging money
by letting your prisoners starve?

706
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:28,986
Supper will be brought.

707
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:33,721
Only I had a better memory...

708
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:37,454
I'm sure I've seen that
distinguished face of yours.

709
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:39,427
Yeah.

710
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,430
Yeah, it's coming to
me now a little more clear.

711
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,599
It happened last year.

712
01:13:45,146 --> 01:13:46,846
Had something to do with a loop...

713
01:13:47,413 --> 01:13:51,866
or a curve or a twist, yeah.

714
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:56,919
That's it, a bend.
That's it, the Big Bend country.

715
01:13:57,493 --> 01:14:00,693
Seems to me the fella you remind
me of was sitting behind a rock.

716
01:14:02,466 --> 01:14:05,306
You spend much time
sitting behind rocks, lieutenant?

717
01:14:13,145 --> 01:14:15,145
Talk like that can get you hurt.

718
01:14:15,386 --> 01:14:18,836
In case you hadn't thought of it
lieutenant, it can also get you hurt.

719
01:14:19,306 --> 01:14:21,933
I doubt if anyone is going to be
fonder of you when they find out that...

720
01:14:21,934 --> 01:14:26,197
you deserted a Ranger named
Two Jones last year, let him get killed.

721
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,744
Killed by you.

722
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:31,770
My guess is that you sent Seven
after me hoping I'd kill him too.

723
01:14:32,277 --> 01:14:35,146
With Seven Jones out of the way,
you could forget the whole Jones...

724
01:14:35,147 --> 01:14:37,677
family, maybe even forget
what a coward you are.

725
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,207
Nobody ever believe
you, telling a story like that.

726
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,685
No? The only way to find out is to tell it.

727
01:14:45,021 --> 01:14:48,871
You going to be at the end of a rope
one way or the other, what are you after?

728
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:52,312
Sometimes I just get a calling
to even things out for a friend.

729
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,489
You're dead set on
pushing your luck, aren't you?

730
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,540
That's right.

731
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:03,059
I'm going to let you out of here.

732
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:06,769
Well, that's sure neighborly of you.

733
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:11,275
You got a reputation for breaking jail.

734
01:15:11,902 --> 01:15:13,502
You're going to try a break now.

735
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:16,592
I don't know, that doesn't seem quite honest.

736
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:21,155
Step out of the cell.

737
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:28,462
Lieutenant, before you shoot,
you mind if I have another puff or two?

738
01:15:31,188 --> 01:15:33,462
Well, I better get started with the dishes.

739
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,536
Was a good meal, doubt even
Flood could've done better than that.

740
01:15:44,334 --> 01:15:48,921
Flood, I'd like to know more
about him, you seem to like him.

741
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,294
- He's kind of a hard man to tell about.
- I wish you'd try.

742
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,974
Well, seems almost
impossible to explain but...

743
01:15:59,947 --> 01:16:03,240
I trust him more than
any man I know, with anything I had.

744
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,147
And at the same time know he
might turn on me any minute.

745
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,010
What is it makes you feel that way about him?

746
01:16:11,241 --> 01:16:15,321
Flood is whatever a man
kind of wants to be, I guess.

747
01:16:16,374 --> 01:16:18,507
Wild and free as a bird.

748
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,204
As free as the hawk
that tried to kill my puppy?

749
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:23,975
Well...

750
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:28,164
- I don't think you understand what I...
- Free enough to kill Hennessy?

751
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:57,388
Yahoo, see you later Seven.

752
01:17:12,588 --> 01:17:13,841
Get the doctor.

753
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:31,521
She'll be fine.

754
01:17:31,788 --> 01:17:34,138
Shock is what does it
when you're hit like that.

755
01:17:34,494 --> 01:17:37,594
I don't suppose you'd have
a cup of hot coffee, would you Mary?

756
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:40,422
Why certainly, in
the kitchen, I'll get it for you.

757
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,200
You ought to get some sleep.

758
01:18:41,532 --> 01:18:42,706
Flood.

759
01:18:48,866 --> 01:18:51,066
Took me a little while to shake the Rangers.

760
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,193
I figured it take you about this long.

761
01:18:53,346 --> 01:18:55,546
- Going to do you a big favor.
- What's that?

762
01:18:56,026 --> 01:18:58,776
Going to give you one last
chance to come along with me.

763
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,080
You know Seven, you and I
hit it off like nobody is business.

764
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,187
That's right, we did.

765
01:19:04,627 --> 01:19:06,927
Well, come on then.
We'll have us a great time.

766
01:19:07,147 --> 01:19:10,307
No, I got to stop you Flood.

767
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,183
You don't think you're
going to put me in that jail again?

768
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,346
I'm going to try.

769
01:19:24,906 --> 01:19:27,056
What's bothering you? You're awful serious.

770
01:19:27,373 --> 01:19:30,773
You remember firing a shot near
this house when you rode out of town?

771
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:32,959
- Yeah.
- Well, you hit a girl.

772
01:19:33,172 --> 01:19:36,092
A girl you never even
knew, you could've killed her.

773
01:19:38,558 --> 01:19:41,972
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You still could've killed her.

774
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:44,758
A man just can't do the things you do.

775
01:19:45,491 --> 01:19:48,931
Look Seven, we can do things that
nobody is ever dreamed of, come on.

776
01:19:49,878 --> 01:19:50,878
No.

777
01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:54,962
You know as well as
I do that you can't stop me.

778
01:19:56,145 --> 01:19:58,532
- I'll do my best.
- Why?

779
01:19:59,278 --> 01:20:02,518
Because of
Hennessy, that girl, all the others.

780
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,691
It's not enough just to be sorry Flood.

781
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:12,264
For all I know, the man who killed my brother
might've been sorry, but it didn't help.

782
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:15,652
Yeah.

783
01:20:17,372 --> 01:20:20,919
Well, so long Seven.

784
01:20:26,839 --> 01:20:30,693
I got to stop you Jim, turn around.

785
01:20:54,907 --> 01:20:59,488
When I first met you, you were
pretty clumsy, you've been improving.

786
01:21:01,448 --> 01:21:03,888
I never knew you to be so slow.

787
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,527
I didn't expect you to miss like that.

788
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:13,754
At the last minute there,
I remembered you owed me $86.

789
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:18,167
Couldn't stand to lose that gambling debt.

790
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:21,046
Yeah.
