「1991年，波斯灣戰爭剛結束」

17
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,897
要不要開槍？
Are we shooting?

18
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,315
什麼？
What?

19
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,860
我們到底要不要開槍打人？
Are we shooting people or what?

20
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,361
我們要開槍嗎？
Are we shooting?

21
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,697
我剛不是這樣問你嗎？
That's what I』m asking you!

22
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,699
答案是什麼？
What's the answer?

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,828
我不知道，所以我才要問
I don't know the answer!
That's what I』m trying to find out!

24
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,664
給我一點口香糖
我剛已經給過你了
-Give me some gum.
-I already gave you some.

25
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:26,294
我看到你眼睛裡有一粒沙子
但弄不出來
I can see a grain of sand in there.
I just can't get it out.

26
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,838
這傢伙似乎有帶武器
I think this guy has a weapon!

27
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,343
果然沒錯
Yeah, he does!

28
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,155
恭喜你，你打死了個中東鬼
Whoa! Congratulations,
my man, you shot yourself a raghead.

29
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,367
沒想到在這場戰爭中
居然還能看到有人被殺
Dag. Didn't think I'd get to see
anybody shot in this war.

30
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,911
幫我照張相
Aw, take my picture.

31
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,206
奪寶大作戰

32
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:10,963
I just want to celebrate another day of livin'

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:16,803
I just want to celebrate another day of life

34
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,641
I put my faith in the people
But the people let me down

35
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,437
So I turned the other way
And I carry on anyhow

36
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,065
That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,734
Another day of livin'

38
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,363
I just want to celebrate

39
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,907
軍營中充滿了歡欣熱鬧的音樂
大家都士氣高昂
Spirits are high,
and the music is boisterous...

40
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,785
這些年輕士兵…
該死的，等一會兒
...as these young troops--
Shit, hold on a second. Okay.

41
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,539
軍營中充滿了歡欣熱鬧的音樂
大家都士氣昂揚…
Music is high, and the spirits
are soaring as these--

42
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,833
我剛剛是不是說「昂揚」？
Did I just say "soaring"?
How did it sound?

43
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,920
聽起來如何？
他們說美軍藉著這次任務
來驅趕越戰帶來的陰影
They say you exorcised the ghost of
Vietnam with a clear, moral imperative.

44
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,129
我們解放了科威特
We liberated Kuwait.

45
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,511
If I had to start again
With just my children and my wife

46
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,640
I would thank my lucky stars
To be living here today

47
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,018
Because the flag
Still stands for freedom

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,438
And they can't take that away

49
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,733
And I'd gladly stand up next to you

50
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,611
And defend her still today

51
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:21,325
'Cause there ain't no doubt
I love this land

52
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,454
God bless the U.S.A.

53

「特洛拜隆
最近喜獲麟兒」
It was you that chose your due

54
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,294
You built a maze you can't get through

55
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,298
I tried to help you all I can
But I can't do nothing for you, man

56
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,758
I can't do nothing for you, man

57
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,433
I can't do nothing for you, man

58
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,476
-Go lean on shells
-Answer man

59
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,103
I can't do nothing for you, man

60
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,812
「康拉德維克
他極為羨慕特洛拜隆」
-Go lean on shells
-Answer man

61
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:57,612
I can't do nothing for you, man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,657
Make you love the wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night

63
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,745
The cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls

64
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,456
Oozy down the bullets in the gun

65
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,666
英勇的戰士…
Trained warrior! Trained warrior!

66
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,668
蓋特少校…
Trained warrior! Oh, my God!

67
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,255
Major Gates, Major Gates, Major Gates!

68

「艾奇蓋特
剩兩周就可退伍」

69
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,101
愛德安娜採訪到什麼新聞？
What's Adriana got?

70
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,312
還不是戰勝慶功的那些鏡頭
Just the celebration story.

71
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,273
就這樣？
這種新聞根本是曇花一現
That's it? That story's evaporating.

72
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,568
伊拉克戰俘的新聞
也是曇花一現
The Iraqi POW story's evaporating.

73
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,364
我要採訪伊拉克將黃金
歸還科威特的新聞
I still have my gold story, though.
Returning the gold to Kuwait.

74
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,032
你對那件事瞭解多少？
What do you know about that?

75
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,326
他們說黃金藏在某個碉堡裡面
They think it's in
some bunker somewhere.

76
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,163
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

77
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,412
怎麼了，上校？
我正要問你
相同的問題呢，少校
-What's going on?
-I was about to ask you the same thing.

78
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,598
你說過他是前特種部隊的一員
他會好好照顧我
真是一派胡言
You said he was former Delta, he'd take
great care of me. What a bunch of bullshit.

79
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,968
讓我來處理，好嗎？
她難道沒有自己的護衛嗎？
-Let me handle this.
-Doesn't she have an escort?

80
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,965
當然有，她就在這裡
你幫她找一個能讓她搞的護衛
-Of course she does. She's right here.
- Find her someone she can fuck...

81
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,801
這樣她就不會來染指
我的帖身保鏢了
你講話小心點
-...so she'll leave my escort alone.
- That's unnecessary.

82
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,308
我不希望他把我採訪到的新聞
洩漏給其他的記者
I don't want him going to other
reporters and giving away my stories.

83
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,353
你根本沒採訪到什麼新聞嘛
你不可以四處張揚
-You don't have any stories.
-You don't tell people that!

84
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,397
看看你自己變成什麼德性
Look at you.
Look at what's become of you.

85
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,566
沒錯，但我至少還穿著衣服
Yes, look at me.
I've got my clothes on! I』m dressed!

86
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:20,857
「愛德安娜克魯茲
五度與艾美獎擦身而過」

87
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,697
沒錯，但你已經人老珠黃
But I will say you are old, Adriana.

88
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,405
我不想為這等狗屎事煩心
少校
你懂不懂？
I really don't need this shit, major.
You understand me?

89
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,744
這是一場媒體戰爭
你最好搞清楚狀況
Yeah.
-This is a media war. A media war...

90
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,329
...and you better get onboard!

91
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,290
我們明天要好好談談
我要好好的修理你
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
I』m gonna straight you out!

92
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,209
照張相
Take a picture!

93
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,419
再照一張
One more!

94
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,925
帥斃了
-Very handsome.
-All right.

95
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,969
So please stay off my back

96
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,513
Or I will attack
And you don't want that

97
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,429
拜隆，你真是神槍手
Yeah!
-Good shot, Barlow.

98
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,434
別鬧了
Hey, enough!

99
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,444
上尉要來了
Captain's coming!

100
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,688
「契夫艾吉
為了逃離底特律而從軍」

101
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,703
你們最好快一點
他現在就來了
You better move your butts.
He's coming right now.

102
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,957
該死的，這些酒是哪兒來的
快處理掉
Goddamn it! Where the hell did this
booze come from? Hey, get rid of it!

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,378
我們明天還要繼續處理
伊拉克人戰俘…
We gotta take more Iraqi prisoners
tomorrow! Tomorrow!

104
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,547
把彈夾拿下來
把武器丟到左邊的地上
Remove the magazine from your weapon.

105
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,841
Sling your weapon over
your left shoulder, muzzle down.

106
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,636
雙手高舉過頭
Have both arms raised above your head.

107
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,140
請跟著領隊士兵
慢慢的朝著多國部隊前進
Approach the multinational force's
position slowly...

108
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,060
...with the lead soldier
holding this document...

109
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,772
將文宣高舉過頭
這樣做就不會被殺死
...above his head. If you do this,
you will not die.

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,860
根據國際慣例
You will be processed
as prisoners of war...

111
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,404
我們會提供戰服，食物，衣服
和遮風避雨棲身之處
...provided food, shelter and clothing...

112
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,658
...and be treated according to the guidelines
provided by the Geneva Convention.

113
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,078
Do not resist.

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,663
這樣做就會得到這些
If you do this, you get this.

115
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:58,876
只要投降，就有吃有睡
If you surrender,
you will get food and shelter. Okay?

116
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,921
沒事的，沒有人會傷害你們的
不要緊張
Everything is cool.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Just relax.

117
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,840
先生，麻煩你把頭巾拿下來
Sir, you're gonna have to
take the turban off as well.

118
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,551
你有沒有在科威特
強暴或折磨任何人？
Did you rape and torture anyone
in Kuwait, Abdul?

119
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,220
那你呢，你這個狗娘養的？
What about you, motherfucker?

120
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,516
你把他們嚇壞了，把槍收起來
你這樣會闖禍的
Hey, hey. You're making them hysterical.
Stop pointing that. You'll get us in trouble.

121
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,518
別緊張，請各位趴在地上
Just relax. We want everybody facedown.

122
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:18,020
-Come on.
-Get down.

123
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,353
聽不懂英文嗎，渾蛋？
Take these things-- Hey,
no comprende English, motherfucker?

124
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,317
你有什麼毛病啊？
What is your fucking problem?

125
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,694
拜託你拿出專業素養
你把他們嚇壞了
Act in a more
professional manner, please.

126
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,656
我也想要保持專業素養
但他不肯拿掉頭巾
I wanna be professional.
He wouldn't take his rags off.

127
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,117
在一旁學著點吧
對不起，先生
Pay attention to how it's done.
Excuse me, sir.

128
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,830
請你像其他的毛巾頭一樣
寬衣解帶，好嗎？
Listen. Sir, we're gonna need you to
disrobe like all the other towelheads, okay?

129
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,711
我也不希望事情演變成這樣
把他的衣服剝下來
I hate to see it come to this.
Strip him down.

130
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,588
Come on, motherfucker.

131
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,217
把你的衣服脫掉
Take your fucking clothes off.

132
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,426
快點
Come on.

133
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:56,225
特洛，快過來看
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Troy. Troy.
Troy, come here. Check this out.

134
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,102
快來看，簡直是變態透了
Freaky thing here, possibly.

135
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,855
那傢伙的屁股裡塞了一些文件
There's a document in that guy's ass.

136
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,731
有狀況了
We got a classified situation.

137
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,733
這張紙是不是被他吃下去了？
You think he ate it?

138
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,486
如果是被吃下去的
不會這麼完整
No, it wouldn't come out
perfect like that if he ate it.

139
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,197
把它拉出來，士兵
-Pull it out, private.
- Back off! Back off!

140
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,407
拉出來
Pull it out.

141
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,161
我從軍不是為了
把手伸到大男人屁股裡去
Man, I didn't join the Army
to pull paper out of people's asses.

142
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,496
百分之百不是
No, sir. Not what I signed up for.

143
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,253
Aw-- Aw--

144
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,921
Ugh!

145
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,299
打開來看
Open it up.

146
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,050
你只給我一隻手套
You only gave me one glove.

147
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,428
我只有一隻手套
但你一定要把它打開來
Sorry, I only have one,
but you have to open it.

148
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,972
我的軍階比你高
你要聽我的話
That's how the chain of command works.

149
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,228
Ugh.

150
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,440
是什麼？
What is it?

151
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,276
不知道，反正很重要就是了
It』s important enough
to squeeze your cheeks for.

152
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,406
你要讓她心甘情願的報導
我們要她報導的事
You're supposed to make her
feel good about stories we want...

153
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,158
而不要去挖
我們不想要讓人知道的事
...not push stories we don't want.

154
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,328
你不可以丟下她
去上另一個記者
You don't walk away from her
and go screw another journalist.

155
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,413
我本來就不想
擔任這個任務，朗
I never wanted this job, Ron.

156
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,082
你在伊拉克的任務結束了
Your work in Iraq was over. Done.

157
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,085
我想要幫你忙
如果你處理得宜的話
I』m trying to help you out.
If you play your cards right...

158
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,796
讓你在國內媒體界找份好差事
...maybe she'll hook you up
with the media at home.

159
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:08,984
去他的好差事
-Fuck that.
-Fuck that?

160
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:11,588
去他的？你以後打算怎麼辦？
Where you going?

161
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,010
你未來一片光明
You got your star clinched.

162
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,305
你無法陞官
難不成都是我的錯？
Oh, so now it's my fault that
you plateaued a long time ago?

163
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,058
我甚至不知道
我們在這裡做了什麼
少來這套…
-I don't even know what we did here.
-Don't start.

164
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,227
告訴我我們在伊拉克
做了什麼？
Just tell me what we did here, Ron.

165
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,021
你想佔領伊拉克
重演越戰舊事嗎？
You wanna occupy Iraq
and do Vietnam all over again?

166
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,814
這就是你想要的嗎？
Is that your brilliant idea?

167
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,731
去他的，我反正要退休了
-Fuck it, I』m retiring anyway.
在你退休之前
你仍然是美國軍人
-Until you do, you're an Army officer.

168
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,571
你仍然要照顧那名記者
別搞砸了
You're still taking care of
that reporter, so do it right.

169
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,951
Let's move this now!

170
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,844
你已經洗了一千次了，別洗了
Come on, you've washed your hands
a thousand times.

171
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,639
誰知道那傢伙屁股裡
有什麼寄生蟲
Lord knows what vermin
live in the butt of a dune coon.

172
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,183
你為何讓這傢伙
當你的跟屁蟲？
Why do you let this cracker
follow you around, man?

173
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,019
他沒問題的
他是從達拉斯的孤兒院來的
He's got no high school.
He's from a group home in Dallas.

174
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,105
他沒念高中，很可憐的
-He doesn't know better.
-Don't say that.

175
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,186
別四處宣揚嘛
就算他是從約翰尼斯堡來的
我也不管
I don't care if he's from Johannesburg.

176
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,777
我不希望聽到任何人
說這些有種族歧視意味的話
I don't wanna hear "dune coon" or
"sand nigger" from him or anybody.

177
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,737
上尉不是也有說嗎？
Captain uses those terms.

178
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,866
康拉德，你可以改稱他們為
「毛巾頭」或是「騎駱駝的」
Look, the point is, "towelhead" and
"camel jockey" are good substitutes.

179
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,576
完全正確
對不起
-Exactly.
- I apologize.

180
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:24,123
你們這些親阿拉伯反伊拉克的
作風搞的我暈頭轉向
A little confusing with all this pro-Saudi,
anti-Iraqi type language and all that.

181
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,375
你拿到高空照片了沒？
Did you get the aerials?

182
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,378
這些照片是哪兒來的？
How'd you get those?

183
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,964
契夫自有辦法
叫華特把守好門口
Chief is hooked up.
-Hey. Keep Walter on that door.

184
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,133
把夜視鏡拿掉
Would you take
those fucking things off?

185
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,051
我從來沒有戴過夜視鏡
I never got to use night vision.

186
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,137
夜視鏡在白天沒有用
They do not work during the day.

187
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,680
還是有點用的
Yeah, they kind of work.

188
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,933
你到外面去好讓契夫研究這張
伊拉克屁眼地圖
Just stand outside so Chief
can translate my Iraqi ass map, okay?

189
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,685
Okay.

190
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,024
你現在打算跟我合作了嗎？
Are you ready to work with me now?

191
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,152
是的
I』m ready to work with you.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,571
很好，因為我得到一個
驚人的線報
Good. Because I've got an amazing lead.

193
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,032
地圖藏在那傢伙的屁股裡
不是這樣的
-It was in his ass.
- That's not the real story.

194
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,576
那是怎樣？
圖藏在他的老二里
-What's the real story?
-It was in the guy's dick.

195
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,621
他們用鑷子把圖拔了出來
那是一本薩達姆碉堡圖？
-Had to pull it out with a pair of tweezers.
-A 10-page atlas of Saddam's bunkers?

196
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,834
沒錯，不過很小
就像是吃乖乖送的那種
Yeah. Only real small, like those books
you get in a box of Cracker Jacks.

197
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,421
他們從那傢伙的耳朵裡
把圖拉了出來
They pull it out the guy ear.

198
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,465
他說什麼？
從耳朵拉出來的
-What?
-"Out of his ear."

199
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,674
也許是鼻子
Maybe out the nose.

200
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,593
他到底在說什麼？
鼻子
-What's he talking about?
-"The nose."

201
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,553
告訴我是哪個部位？
你讓我來問
-What body part?
-Let me handle this.

202
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:23,818
那張圖被縫在他的後腦杓裡
那張圖被縫在他的後腦杓裡？
縫在後腦杓裡
-It was stitched in back of his head.
- Stitched in the back of his head.

203
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,059
他叫什麼名字？
誰？
-The guy's name?
- What guy?

204
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,518
找到圖的人
我不能說
The guy who found it.

205
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,145
放屁，你說過可以告訴我們
抱歉，現在不能說
- I cannot tell you.
- Fuck that!

206
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,022
-You said you could.
-Sorry, not now.

207
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,858
這小子什麼都不知道
- This guy doesn't know shit.
- Adriana, come here.

208
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,068
他什麼都不知道
He doesn't know shit.

209
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,197
聽著，他是法國特種部隊的人
他能幫我們的
Listen to me. This guy is French
Special Forces and he can help us.

210
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,907
他能幫我們？
是的，他是我的朋友
-He can?
-Yes, and he's my friend.

211
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,493
但有你在，他就不會說
But he's not gonna talk to me
if you're around.

212
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,536
你最好別耍我
我沒有
-Better not be fucking with me.
-I』m not.

213
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,665
我這次一定要採訪到這個新聞
你會如願的
-I want the story this time.
-You'll get the story. Okay?

214
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,336
這一定是薩達姆的碉堡
就在卡巴拉和納撒拉間
These have got to be Saddam's
bunkers between Karbala and Nazaria.

215
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,545
裡面有什麼？
What's inside?

216
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,961
根據我們的情報
裡面有畢加索的名畫
新力電器，亞曼尼名牌服飾
勞力士
According to Intel,
Picasso, Sony, Armani, Rolex.

217
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,260
科威特是阿拉伯的首富之區
薩達姆把這裡洗劫一空
Kuwait was like the Arab Beverly Hills.
Saddam jacked them for it.

218
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,763
如果能帶一些
好東西回去就好了
Be nice to bring something home
besides sand fleas.

219
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,016
只要拿到一隻勞力士軍表
我就能買下一棟房子
One gold Rolex would get me a very
nice house outside of Garland.

220
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,185
五隻勞力士就能買一輛
萊瑟斯敞蓬車
Five would get a Lexus convertible.

221
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,646
萊瑟斯不出敞蓬車
才怪
-Lexus doesn't make one.
-Yes, they do.

222
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,147
後面還可以放嬰兒椅
It has room for a kid seat.

223
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,566
永恆有出敞蓬車
-Infiniti has a convertible, not Lexus.
-Wrong.

224
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,858
但萊瑟斯沒有
你錯了
不管怎麼說
上帝讓我們得到這張藏寶圖
我相信我們能夠找到寶藏
Either way, the Lord put this map in
our path. I believe we'll find something.

225
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,323
上帝也賜給我們一條
充滿地雷之路
He could also put a land mine
in our path.

226
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,660
我不這麼認為
我受過聖火洗禮
I don't think so. I've been fire
baptized, and this feels safe.

227
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,318
我覺得應該不會有危險
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

228
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,123
耶穌會指引我的
I have a ring of Jesus fire
to guide my decisions.

229
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,831
你在耍我，對吧？
-Do I look like I』m putting you on?
我像是在耍你嗎？
-You're putting me on, right?

230
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,420
好吧，你說是就是
Okay, ring of Jesus fire.

231
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,963
停
Halt!

232
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,673
不要動，渾蛋
Freeze, motherfucker!

233
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,714
對不起，這邊是閒人勿入
讓開
-Sir, this tent is restricted, sir.
-Get out of my way.

234
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,928
緊急情況…
Sir! Sir!

235
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,758
該死的
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! Goddamn it.

236
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,602
午安，這裡是
直腸外科帳篷嗎？
Good afternoon.

237
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,939
Would this be the proctology tent?

238
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,524
不是，長官
No, sir.

239
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,402
那就是泌尿科帳篷羅
還是神精外科？
Maybe it's a urology tent.

240
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,281
Or the neurology tent.

241
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,700
還是耳鼻喉科？
Or the ear, nose and throat tent.

242
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,119
上尉在開小組會議，長官
Captain's at a staff meeting, sir.

243
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,704
上尉是直腸外科專家嗎？
Captain a proctologist?

244
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:13,371
什麼是直腸外科專家？
那不重要
-What's a proctologist, sir?
- It doesn't matter.

245
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,586
我不是來找上尉的
我是來找拜隆士官長
I』m not looking for him.
I』m looking for Barlow.

246
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,015
不是有句俗話說
「聞到屎味就離真相不遠」
You're on the path to truth when you smell
shit. Isn』t that what they say, sergeant?

247
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,852
我沒看過你，長官
你是我們隊上的人嗎？
I don't recognize you, sir.
Are you in this division?

248
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,855
不，他是特種部隊的人
He's not from this division.
He's Special Forces.

249
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,733
你們有沒有把這張圖
拿給你們的長官看？
Have you soldiers
presented this map to your captain?

250
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,359
還沒有
Not yet, sir.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,070
我拿去給他
I'll take it to him.

252
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,695
沒這個必要，長官
他是我的直屬長官
我會拿去給他
That's not necessary, sir.
He's my CO. I can take it to him.

253
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,950
別太貪心了
Don't get grabby, sergeant.

254
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,453
他是我們的直屬長官
我得告訴他你把這張圖拿走了
He's our CO, sir.
I'd have to tell him you took it.

255
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,083
這樣做對我們都沒好處
是吧？
That won't do either of us any good,
will it?

256
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,504
是的
No, sir.

257
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,550
坐下
Sit down.

258
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,098
你圖上畫的是什麼？
是碉堡
-What do you see here?
-Bunkers, sir.

259
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,768
碉堡裡放的是什麼東西？
他們從科威特搶來的東西
- What are in them?
- Stuff they stole from Kuwait.

260
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,605
鬼扯，裡面放的是
科威特的金條
Bullshit. I』m talking about
millions in Kuwaiti bullions.

261
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,067
你是說那種雞湯塊嗎？
You mean them little cubes
you put in hot water and make soup?

262
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,070
不是雞湯塊
No, not the little cubes
you put in hot water to make soup.

263
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,571
是金塊
Gold bricks, Conrad.

264
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:29,197
這是薩達姆從阿拉伯手中偷走的
我再去偷他的東西
一點都不會良心不安
Saddam stole it from the sheiks.
I have no problem stealing it from Saddam.

265
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,496
我認為他應該是把這些金條
分成好幾堆儲藏
My guess is, he's divided these bricks
into several different stashes.

266
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,774
想要從他的軍隊手中
奪走一堆應該不是難事
Just one of these stashes would be easy
for us to take from his deserting army.

267
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,974
只要成功我們這輩子
就可以不用再工作了
That would be enough
to get us out of our day jobs.

268
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:43,708
除非你們不願意放棄
你們的工作
Unless of course you reservists
are in love with your day jobs.

269
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,940
我沒有工作
I don't really have a day job, sir.

270
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,234
首先我們要確定
這張真的是藏寶圖
First thing we have to do...

271
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,654
...is make sure this is more
than a love letter to an Iraqi.

272
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,156
卡巴拉附近有許多碉堡
It』s a series of bunkers
outside Karbala, sir.

273
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,492
也許吧
我們百分之百確定
Maybe.
-Definitely, sir.

274
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,369
偵察照片已經證實了這一點
The recon photos match.

275
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,996
走著瞧吧
We'll see.

276
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,123
Dag.

277
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,334
咱們特種部隊配備精良
所以才人見人怕
It』s what makes S.F. so badass.
We got the best flashlights.

278
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,670
我看的確是一堆碉堡
東邊還有三個小村莊
Still looks like a series of bunkers.

279
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,840
Three villages a little farther
to the east.

280
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,676
北邊75公里處
應該是65公里
-Seventy-five clicks north.
- More like 65.

281
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,511
這離聯合國部隊很遠
Way north of any allied troops.

282
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,014
簡直是太完美了
離部隊越遠越好
Perfect. We don't want
any troops around.

283
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,183
我們可以開著吉普車
到幼發拉底河河谷去
Yeah. Just us and a Humvee
up by the Euphrates River Valley.

284
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,311
摩西小時候
就是被人丟在那裡的
Where they put Moses in the basket.

285
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,645
那是埃及
That's Egypt.

286
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,567
我們東方三賢人
要去偷這些金條
We three kings be stealing the gold

287
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,818
安靜
Quiet down!

288
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,195
我們的朋友都開保時捷
我一定要迎頭趕上
My friends all drive Porsches
I must make amends

289
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,862
閉嘴，好嗎？
你唱完了沒？
- Hey, just shut up, okay?
- Are you done singing?

290
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,908
地雷怎麼辦，長官？
What about mines, sir?

291
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,786
82軍已經完成掃雷任務
我們不要離開馬路就好
Grid was swept by the 82nd.
We'll stick to the roads.

292
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,747
我們現在只需要弄一部
2，5公噸的卡車就行了
Are we gonna need
a deuce-and-a-half?

293
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,798
不，開吉普車
比較不會引人注目
It』s easier to slip out in a Humvee.
如果我們到找寶藏怎麼辦？
-What if we have a lot to carry?

294
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,708
那就搶一輛伊拉克卡車
這樣萬一被攔下來
也比較不會出事
We'll grab an Iraqi truck.
Better cover if we get stopped.

295
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,419
我們可以說這是我們從
伊拉克軍俘據來的
沒錯
We could always say we captured it.
-That's right.

296
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,339
我們黎明出發
午餐前就可以回來了
沒什麼大不了的
We leave at dawn, back before lunch.
No big deal.

297
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,428
站在外面那小子叫什麼名字？
華特
-What's the guy's name outside?
-Walter.

298
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,890
波羅，進來
-Bolo! Get in here!
-Who's Bolo, sir?

299
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,059
波羅是誰？
是個不知道自己在做什麼的人
Bolo is a guy who
doesn't know what he's doing.

300
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,269
什麼事，長官？
-Yes, sir?
- Want you to get this reporter...

301
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,548
我要你去擺平那個記者
你知道愛德安娜克魯茲
是誰吧？
...off my back.
Know who Adriana Cruz is?

302
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,398
她是NBS的記者
沒錯
-Reporter on NBS, sir.
- That's right.

303
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:26,902
告訴她我去幫她打探消息
你會帶她來找我
Tell her I』m checking a story
and you're bringing her to meet me.

304
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,654
去伊拉克？
不
In Iraq?
-No.

305
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,365
我會給你一張假地圖
你帶她出去兜兜風
I'll give you a fake copy of this map.

306
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,659
Take her on a ride
that lasts all morning...

307
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,662
但絕對不能靠近那些
卡拉巴村莊
...and goes nowhere near
the villages outside of Karbala.

308
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,916
如果找不到我那是因為
你們迷路了，明白嗎？
When you don't find me, it'll be
because you got lost. Is that clear?

309
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,373
是的
還有其它的問題嗎？
-Yes, sir.
-Any other questions?

310
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,588
特種部隊是不是要割下
敵人的耳朵？
Yeah. Is it true that to be S.F.,
you gotta cut off an enemy's ear?

311
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,255
你制得住他嗎？
我保證沒問題
-Are you able to control him?
-Yes, sir. He'll be fine, I promise.

312
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,928
我們準備明天早上出發
Let's get ready to roll in the morning.

313
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,353
出發羅
All right, here we go, ma'am.

314
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:17,938
快丟
快丟
Pull!

315
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,416
快丟
Pull!

316
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,960
我也要玩
Let me get some, chief.

317
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:32,046
快丟
快丟
Pull!

318
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,386
我丟的比你好
-I gave you a better arc!
- What you talking about?

319
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:34,685
你在說什麼？
I threw the ball at a higher arc.

320
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,681
我丟的球比較高比較容易打
鬼扯
-Made it easier.
-Bullshit!

321
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,975
黑人不適合當四分衛
比較適合當接球員
Blacks make better receivers
than quarterbacks.

322
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,226
住嘴
Stop speaking.

323
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,645
華倫穆恩是有史以來
最出色的四分衛
Warren Moon is one of
the best in the league.

324
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,356
就算有了華倫穆恩
休士頓隊還是一樣吃癟
Houston's gone nowhere
with Warren Moon.

325
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,034
那倫達卡寧漢呢？
契夫，別說了
-Randall Cunningham?
-Don't get in the mud with him.

326
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,983
要是靠卡寧漢
老鷹隊就進不了超級杯了
Eagles'll never make it to
the Super Bowl with Cunningham.

327
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,031
道格威廉斯不光是讓紅人隊
進入超級杯，而且還贏了
Doug Williams not only took
the Redskins to the Super Bowl...

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,992
-...but they won.
-Yeah, so?

329
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,491
那又怎樣？
的確有不少出色的四分衛
是黑人
We can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks.

330
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,830
看看你有多行
Let's see what you can hit.

331
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,625
你這個爛白人
你絕對打不中伊拉克人
Come on, sorry-ass cracker!
You'll never hit no Iraqi!

332
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,211
才怪，我能一槍
轟掉伊拉克人的頭
I'll hit that Iraqi.
I'll blow his fucking head off!

333
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,047
契夫，你別管他
和他辯只會越來越糟
Chief, he talks like that,
ignore him or it'll get worse.

334
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,009
你說的對
不過有時候我實在忍不住
You're right, you're right.
Just can't help myself sometimes.

335
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,343
注意看
Watch this.

336
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,847
Whoa! Unh!

337
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,934
那是怎麼回事？
我在足球上綁了炸藥
-What was that?
- I rigged a football with C4, sir.

338
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
你為何那麼做？
Why would you do that?

339
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,942
你自己說只要開的夠遠
就可以開槍取樂
You said we could fire off
some rounds when we left camp.

340
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,445
我說你們可以開幾槍
I said that you could fire a few rounds.

341
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,530
我們根本沒有體驗到
戰爭的刺激
We didn't get to see any action, sir.

342
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,701
你想體驗刺激？
是的
-You wanna see some action?
- Yeah, I do, sir.

343
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,215
你想看的是這些嗎？
Is this what you're after?

344
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,010
美軍在這裡投擲了不少炸彈
We dropped a lot of bombs here.

345
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,472
我們也活埋了許多人
We also buried a lot of guys alive.

346
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,889
我們唯一看到的激烈戰況
是在電視新聞上
除了特洛開槍打死的那個人
The only action we seen was on CNN,
except for that dude Troy shot.

347
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,187
你打中了他的喉嚨？
是的
-Shot him in the neck?
-That's right, sir.

348
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,398
他簡直酷斃了
隔著四百碼就打死了那個人
Fucking badass. I was there.
Fucking took him out at 400 yards.

349
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,523
把他的頭打得半天高
簡直是神槍手
Head popped up 3 feet in the air.
It was a crazy shot, man.

350
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,529
別這麼說
你知不知道被槍打到會怎樣？
You know anything
about gunshot wounds?

351
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,155
不知道
你聽好了
-I don't know.
- Specifically.

352
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,784
如果沒被子彈打死
就很可能會發生敗血症
The worst thing about a gunshot wound,
provided you survive the bullet...

353
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,578
-...is something called sepsis.
-Infection of the blood.

354
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,577
血液感染？
沒錯
假設你腹部中彈
Right. Say a bullet tears into you--

355
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,417
會在體內造成
充滿死亡組織的部位
Creates a cavity of dead tissue.
That cavity...

356
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,463
如果被膽汁或細菌感染的話
你就死定了
...it fills up with bile and bacteria.
You're fucked.

357
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,804
我們這次行動絕對不能開槍
But we're gonna do this
without firing any shots...

358
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,266
為了以防萬一
我們來排演一下
...and just to be sure,
we're gonna do a dry run.

359
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,142
穿好你們的防護衣
So get your suits on.

360
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,689
假設那頭母牛是碉堡外的守衛
We will say that the cow is
a primary guard outside the bunker.

361
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,441
你們的動作一定要快
Pull up fast. Stop short.

362
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,777
而且要侵略性十足，懂嗎？
Move very aggressively. Got it?

363
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,112
懂了
Got it!

364
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,030
開始
Go!

365
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,469
有沒有人受傷？
Who's hurt?

366
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,763
這些都是牛血
It』s all cow.

367
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,142
沒錯，都是牛的血
Yeah, it's all cow.

368
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,394
你們有沒有看到牛頭
被射的半天高？
Kaboom!

369
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,688
Y'all see that cow's head shoot up?

370
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,065
簡直就像卡通一樣，瘋狂極了
Just like a cartoon.
It』s fucking crazy.

371
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,067
你說這裡的地雷
已經被清乾淨了
You said this area was swept for mines.

372
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,404
不是地雷，是集束炸彈
這種炸彈很難找的
Wasn't a mine. It was a cluster bomb.
Very hard to see.

373
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,657
上車吧，我們要出發了
Get in the Humvee.
We're moving on.

374
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,327
Round, round, get around
I get around

375
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,038
Yeah, get around
Ooh, ooh, I get around

376
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,334
Round, round, get around

377
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,835
-I get around
-I get around, yeah

378
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,587
Get around

379
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,796
I get around

380
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,757
-I get around
-Get around, round, round

381
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,425
-I get around
-From town to town

382
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,427
我們衝進去，別忘了開保險
We go in fast, leave the safeties on.

383
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,388
攻他們個措手不及
Hit them with the blinding power
of American sunshine.

384
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,351
-I』m making real good bread
-Get around, round, round, I get around

385
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,645
I』m gettin' bugged
Driving up and down the same old strip

386
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,024
I gotta find a new place
Where the kids are hip

387
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,572
My buddies and me
Are gettin' real well-known

388
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,867
Yeah, the bad guys know us
And they leave us alone

389
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,077
I get around

390
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,620
碉堡在哪裡？
Where's the bunker?

391
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,705
在那裡
There. No, there!

392
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,915
不，在那裡
Round, round, I get around

393
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,918
-I』m a real cool head
-Get around, round, round, I get around

394
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,544
I』m making real good bread

395
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,090
我們是奉美國總統之命行事
Orders from the president
of the United States of America.

396
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:44,052
我們是奉美國總統之命行事
Orders from the president
of the United States of America.

397
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,553
退後
-Step aside.
- Get back!

398
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,347
趴在地上
On the ground, right now.

399
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,559
我們是美軍
We are the Army
of the United States of America.

400
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,894
退後
Stay back!

401
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,690
我們是美軍
We are the Army
of the United States of America.

402
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,398
我沒有牛奶喂孩子
No milk! Baby milk!

403
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,487
-Baby milk!
-Let's go.

404
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:07,909
走吧
我們是來保護各位的
不要害怕，退後
We are here for
your protection and safety.
Stay calm. Lay back. Hey.

405
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,203
退後，快點
Let's go, step aside. Move!

406
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:14,499
這是美國總統布希的命令
是停火協議的一部份
Orders from President Bush.
Part of the ceasefire agreement.

407
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:16,838
請你們合作

408
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,417
「這些美國人是創子手
全身沾滿鮮血」

409
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,172
安全了，我們走吧
Clear. Let's move.

410
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,844
我們是美國軍人
- United States military!
- United States military!

411
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,345
我們是美國軍人，全部出去
Everybody out!

412
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,682
我們是來保護各位的
知道嗎？
We are here for your protection
and safety, all right?

413
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,770
趴下去
Hey. Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground.

414
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:41,668
美國人來了，我們安全了

415
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:45,658
我們可以對抗薩達姆

416
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,199
這是美國的命令
Order from the United States.

417
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,209
該死的
Ah. Shit!

418
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,132
再來
Again!

419
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,050
不要動
美國萬歲
Freeze!
-I love the United State of freedom.

420
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,972
我恨薩達姆
-I hate Saddam.
-Yah! Yah!

421
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,141
放開他
-Yah! Yah! Yah!
-Let him go!

422
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,771
沒問題，朋友
No problem, my friend. No problem.

423
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,064
沒問題
No problem.

424
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,149
叫他閉嘴
Tell him to shut up. Be quiet.

425
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,151
我愛美國
I am love United State of freedom.

426
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,487
我也愛美國
I』m love United States of freedom too.

427
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,865
冷靜點，不要說話
我是你們的朋友
- Just calm down and be quiet, okay?
- I am friend. Friend.

428
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,742
我是你們的朋友
I am-- I am friend. I am friend.

429
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,702
你們是來找化學武器的嗎？
-You look for chemical weapon?
- No.

430
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,038
我們是來找黃金的
這裡沒有黃金
-We look for the gold.
-No gold here.

431
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,288
閉嘴

432
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,707
沒有黃金
No gold.

433
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,334
你說什麼？
這裡沒有黃金
- What did you say?
- No gold.

434
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:44,059
他說這裡沒有黃金
那黃金在哪裡？
- He says there's no gold here.
- Where's the gold?

435
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,965
殺了他
遵命
-Kill him.
-You wanna die?

436
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,551
你想死嗎？
在另一個村莊中的碉堡裡
在另一個碉堡裡？
-Other bunker, other village! Yes.
-Other bunker?

437
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,342
不是這個碉堡，是另一個？
不是這裡
-Not this bunker? Another?
- No. Not this town.

438
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,347
在那裡嗎？
That town? That town?

439
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,891
對，就是那裡
That town! Yes, yes, yes! That town.

440
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,645
我們走吧
Let's go.

441
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,358
打倒薩達姆

442
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:08,822
你為何對他們丟石頭？
Why you throwing rocks at them?

443
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,889
解放伊拉克

444
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:25,868
快攔住那輛卡車
這裡不准送東西來

445
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,756
是牛奶
It』s milk.

446
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,018
請送藥來
Please bring us food.

447
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,985
-Please bring medicine.
- Medicine. Medicine.

448
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,608
請幫幫我們
-Please help us.
- Hey, hey. Hey, come on.

449
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,940
別這樣
下車
- We need doctors.
- Off the vehicle!

450
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,322
女士，請你下車
Ma'am, you'll have to step down
from the vehicle.

451
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,616
醫院…
Hospital! Hospital!

452
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,034
食物，我們好餓
We need your help, please.

453
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,911
Food. Food.

454
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,121
把我們的口糧給他們
我們快離開這裡
Give them the M.R.E.s. Let's go!

455
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:43,198
拿去吧

456
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:44,792
Take that. Take that.

457
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,547
那個女人的水被士兵搶走了
The soldier's taking the water
away from that woman.

458
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:50,965
Heads up!

459
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,093
Here you go.

460
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,304
快下去
Look out! Get off!

461
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,014
Hey.

462
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,433
把東西還給那個小男孩
Hey, give that back to the boy!

463
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,692
帶我一起去
-Take me, take me, take me.
- Excuse me. No.

464
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,654
你不能跟我們來
-You can't come with us.
-Please take me. Aah!

465
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,171
冷靜點…
Right here, right now.

466
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,260
剛剛那裡到底發生什麼事？
The fuck was going on back there, major?

467
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,638
平民唾棄士兵，士兵射擊平民
Civilians spitting on soldiers.
Soldiers shooting civilians.

468
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,515
他們根本對我們不屑一顧
Ignoring us like we weren't there.

469
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,976
伊拉克軍隊已經向我們投降了
現在平民才是他們的目標
They surrendered.
Now they're after civilians.

470
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,852
他們為何要炸掉牛奶車？
Why'd they blow up that milk truck?

471
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,938
他們想要餓死那些人
為何？
-Trying to starve the people out.
-Why?

472
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,858
布希叫平民起身反抗薩達姆
Bush told the people
to rise up against Saddam.

473
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,194
他們以為美軍會幫助平民
但事實不然
They thought they had our support,
they don't.

474
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,363
現在平民遭到屠殺
Now they're getting slaughtered.

475
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,371
另一座碉堡在哪裡？
So where's the next bunker?

476
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,874
如果那人說的沒錯
就在離這裡20公里處
About 20 clicks on the map,
according to what that guy said.

477
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,752
不，不是
No, it's not.

478
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,339
那座井有問題
There was something about that well.

479
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,050
哪座井？
村中的那座井
- What well?
- The well in the center of town.

480
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,013
那裡有士兵防守
我打賭下面有地下碉堡
There were soldiers guarding it.
I bet there's a bunker in there.

481
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:22,056
那傢伙騙我們
The guy lied to us.

482
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,642
黃金就在那裡
It』s back where we came from.

483
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,400
我不能這麼做
Hey, I don't know if I can do this, okay?

484
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,736
Hey! I got a family.

485
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:38,529
我有妻小
如果在戰爭結束之後
我還被打成殘障
If I shit in a bag for life because
I got shot after the war was over...

486
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,742
那就太荒謬了
...that'd be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

487
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,494
人生最重要的是什麼？
What is the most important
thing in life?

488
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,496
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

489
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,499
人生最重要的是什麼？
What's the most important thing?

490
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,835
尊重
這太依靠別人了
-Respect.
- Too dependent on other people.

491
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,546
是愛嗎？
你有點太天真了吧
-What, love?
-A little Disneyland, isn't it?

492
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,423
上帝的旨意
God's will.

493
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,505
很接近了
不然是什麼？
-Close.
- What is it then?

494
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,635
需要
Necessity.

495
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,304
怎麼說？
As in...?

496
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:05,016
人類會視自己的需要而行動
People do what is most necessary
to them at any given moment.

497
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:10,104
現在薩達姆的部隊最需要的
就是鎮壓民眾的暴亂
Now, what's most necessary to Saddam's
troops is to put down the uprising.

498
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,273
我們愛幹嘛就幹嘛
他們不會管我們的
We can do what we want.
They won't touch us.

499
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,693
好吧，但我還是會穿著
防彈衣的
All right. I'll be wearing
fashionable Kevlar.

500
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,112
我也是
Me too.

501
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,948
來吧，康拉德
Come on, Conrad.

502
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,660
那些碉堡到底在哪裡？
Where the hell are the bunkers?

503
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,080
一定就在這裡附近
Supposed to be right around here.

504
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,040
這些火焰很壯觀吧
How about these fires?

505
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,168
我已經報導過油田大火了
I already did this story, goddamn it.

506
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,129
要不要看看沼澤中的塘鵝？
How about a rare pelican
migration out by the marshes?

507
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,548
去他的塘鵝，快停車
Fuck that! Stop the car!

508
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,801
這附近沒有軍營
I don't see any bunkers. Do you?

509
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,470
我們一定會找到少校的
We'll find Major Gates, ma'am.

510
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,473
放屁，這裡只有鶴
Bullshit. All we're finding
is Ukrainian cranes.

511
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,016
它們是塘鵝
Pelicans.

512
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:51,479
這則新聞真是老掉牙了
真是浪費時間
This story has been so done.
A waste of my fucking time.

513
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,606
看看這些倒霉的鳥
全身沾油了油污
Look at these poor fucking birds.

514
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:59,024
簡直是生態大浩劫
All covered in some kind of fucking oil,
ecological, catastrophic....

515
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,071
Fuck it.

516
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,452
他媽的
It』s so goddamn horrible!

517
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,332
真可怕
Jesus Christ!

518
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,756
我的天啊，可憐的鳥
Poor fucking birds.

519
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,716
它們真可憐，慘透了
Look at them.

520
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,386
It』s so sad.

521
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,432
你別想騙我
You're not gonna fuck me.

522
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,722
艾奇答應要幫我找金塊
and I』m driving.
我來開車
I was promised the gold story,

523
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,438
按照軍方的規定，你不能開車
Military regulations. You cannot drive.

524
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,606
女士，麻煩你離開那輛車
Step away from the Chenowth, ma'am!

525
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,358
別逼我開槍
Don't make me shoot you, ma'am!

526
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,448
Ma'am!

527
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,870
求求你停車
Ma'am! Please fucking stop!

528
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,175
你要不要告訴我他在哪裡？
You gonna tell me where he is?

529
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,385
我不能告訴你
放屁
- I can't tell you. I can't.
- Bullshit!

530
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,387
他在哪裡？
我不能告訴你…
-Where is he?
-I can't give you that--

531
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,056
少來了，告訴我他在哪裡？
Come on, bitch. Tell me where he is.

532
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,389
我不能…
否則我就把你丟在這裡等死
- I can't, ma'am.
- You'll die here like these birds!

533
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,104
他在卡巴拉附近的村莊裡
It』s a village near Karbala!

534
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,151
好，咱們去卡巴拉吧
All right. Let's go to Karbala.

535
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,654
趴下…
Get down! Get down!

536
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,997
趴下
-Hey, get down!
-Get down!

537
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,394
別逼我開槍
這次我們可不是鬧著玩的
Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul.
We're gonna have no nonsense this time.

538
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,486
你這個該死的騙子
Hey! You fucking liar!

539
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,655
Hey!

540
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,660
不要跑
Freeze!

541
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,496
根據5月3日簽的停火協議
By orders of the ceasefire
signed in Safwan, March 3rd...

542
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,123
美軍要扣押所有伊拉克
由科威特掠奪來的東西
...the United States military
hereby confiscates...

543
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,418
...all materials stolen by Iraq
from the state of Kuwait.

544
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,421
你們偷的東西全部要送回去
That means everything you took
is going back.

545
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,508
只要大家保持冷靜
我們就可以速戰速決
Everybody stay calm and
we'll get through this quickly.

546
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,052
懂了嗎？很好
Is that clear? Good!

547
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,263
去抓他
Now-- Hey! Grab that--

548
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,349
Hello? Hello? Hello?

549
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,812
契夫，別亂扣板機
Keep your finger off the trigger.

550
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,939
抱歉，長官
-Sorry about that, sir.
-No.

551
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,771
不要
可以送給你太太
For wife.

552
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,776
我離婚了
I』m divorced.

553
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,738
最新最好的產品
Newest and best. Newest and best.

554
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,615
這才不是最新最好的
雜音那麼大，畫面又不清不楚
Newest and best has
better noise reduction.

555
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,160
趴下
Less distortion. Get on the ground.

556
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,289
聽這種音樂不好
This is bad music. This is bad for you.

557
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,334
我要你告訴我黃金在哪裡
Now, I want you to tell me
where the gold is.

558
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,420
少校，這裡還有一扇門
There's another door over here.

559
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,514
沒事的，他是犯人…
It』s okay. He is prisoner. It』s okay.

560
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,367
對付叛黨是伊拉克的事
我們把他們帶開
不會煩你們的
Okay, okay. We take them outside
so we don't bother you, okay?

561
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,928
別擔心，我們待會兒
再把犯人帶回來

562
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,786
你最好別忘了帶他們回來

563
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,877
你去開那扇門
Hey. You open that door now.

564
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,046
去開門
Open that door.

565
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,675
快去
Let's go!

566
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,896
趴在地上
Hey. Get down on the ground.

567
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,565
犯人不能離開這裡
-The prisoners stay!
- You, soldier.

568
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:09,608
快趴下…
犯人不能離開
-Get on the ground!
-The prisoners must stay!

569
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,878
這些東西是屬於薩達姆的

570
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:34,438
薩達姆現在擔心的是叛黨

571
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,779
這是薩達姆的

572
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,439
閉嘴，他已經簽署了和平協定

573
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,258
Hey!

574
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:23,644
聽我說
你們從科威特搶來的東西
現在都屬於我們的了
Listen to me. Everything you stole from
Kuwait belongs to us now. You understand?
I got him.

575
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,230
放回去
為何？
-Put it back.
-Why?

576
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,316
我們要照原定計劃去找金條
而不是這些東西
We stick to the plan,
plan is for the gold. We're not thieves.

577
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,986
我們要找的是伊拉克的金條
We're returning Kuwaiti bullion, correct?

578
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,858
金條
Full.

579
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,568
金條
Full.

580
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,873
希望萊瑟斯敞蓬車
有我想要的顏色
I』m getting a fleet of Lexus convertibles,
every color.

581
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,375
你這會兒可以買
萊瑟斯敞蓬車了
I told you, Lexus don't
make a convertible.

582
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,960
要買儘管買
但萊瑟斯沒有出敞蓬車
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

583
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,214
Okay. You're on, but it won't be
a convertible. I guarantee you.

584
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,675
該死的
Ow. Shit! Ah.

585
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,053
你沒事吧？
-You all right?
- Yeah. It landed on my foot.

586
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,927
我的腳被金條砸到了
用這些箱子根本不能搬
They definitely didn't get it here
in these bags.

587
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,391
我們一定要找
別的袋子來裝才行
The tensilary strength in these
is only 200 pounds.

588
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,310
什麼？
-What?
- Tensilary strength.

589
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,643
我要找別的袋子來裝
他以前在機場工作
He works at an airport.

590
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,233
這種袋子可以裝
65磅左右的東西
If we put it in one
of these Vuitton bags...

591
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,236
...they can hold about 65 pounds,
maybe more.

592
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,737
還有沒有別的行李箱？
You have any more luggage?

593
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,104
這裡歸美國軍方管
United States military
is in charge here.

594
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,487
我在加油站看到一輛卡車
I saw a truck out by the gas station.

595
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,237
什麼加油站？
上面那個加油站
-What gas station?
-The one upstairs.

596
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,285
我上去看看
Let's see what U-Haul has on the lot.

597
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,917
我們需要一輛卡車
Conrad. We need a truck.

598
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,254
你們找到了嗎？
Did we get it? Did we get it?

599
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,627
找到了嗎？
找到了
很多嗎？
-We got it.
-Is it a lot?

600
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,676
多的不得了
你們上面沒事吧？
Conrad, you have no idea.
Are you cool here?

601
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,469
他們根本不理我
Yeah. They've been ignoring me.

602
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,806
你保持冷靜就好了
我去找一輛卡車
Don't worry about it. Just stay calm.
I』m gonna find a truck.

603
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,978
快離開那輛卡車
Move! Move away from the vehicle!

604
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,314
快走
Let's go!

605
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,520
你們要帶走科威特的黃金？
You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?

606
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,065
是的
We take the Kuwaiti gold, yes.

607
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,485
不能讓薩達姆留下來？
不能
- Saddam cannot keep?
- No, Saddam cannot keep.

608
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,362
薩達姆現在要煩心的事
實在在太多了
Saddam have too many problem today.

609
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:06,049
沒錯
要我們幫忙拿嗎？
-He certainly does.
-You need help to carry?

610
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,952
那就麻煩你們了
I think we'll be all right.

611
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,081
這兩個人會去幫你們
對，他們會幫你們
-These men help you.
-Yeah, these men help you.

612
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,629
你們趕快拿完東西走人吧
And then you go away fast
from all this bullshit.

613
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,886
繼續搬…
Keep it going, keep it going.

614
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,954
不要走，求求你們不要走
Don't leave. Please don't leave.

615
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,409
不要走
Don't leave!

616
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:02,210
救救我們，不要走
Look!

617
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,340
救救我們
Help!

618
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,801
Look! Look!

619
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,761
Help!

620
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,805
求求你們
Please!

621
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,727
不要走…
Don't go. Don't go.

622
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,011
請你們走吧
You go now, please.

623
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:50,971
我看沒這麼簡單
I don't think so.

624
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,931
這個男人意圖叛亂
This man is leader of uprising.

625
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,185
少校，按照原定計劃進行吧
Major, let's just stick to the plan.
The plan is for the gold.

626
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,313
我們可以先幫他們然後再離開
We can help these people first,
then we'll be on our way.

627
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,857
不行，我們是來找黃金的
走吧
This is not what we're here for.
Let's go!

628
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,365
各位…
Cover me.

629
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,548
不要隨便開槍，康拉德
你知道會有什麼後果
No unnecessary shots, Conrad,
because we know what they do.

630
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,009
會害人被膽汁感染得到敗血症
They make infected pockets
full of bile, sir.

631
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,844
沒錯
That's right, that's what they do.

632
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,974
我要你們離開這裡
I want you to leave this town.

633
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,599
我們離開的話會被薩達姆殺死的
連我們的家人都不會放過
Saddam kill us if we leave.
Kill our family.

634
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:26,518
我們已經讓你們拿黃金走了
現在你就不能來煩我們了
We give you the gold.
Now U.S.A. out of Iraq.

635
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,404
不要開槍
No shooting.

636
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:32,739
好，我們好好談談
Okay. Okay, we work something out.

637
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,284
不要激動…
Easy! Take it easy!

638
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,791
怎麼了？
What's happening?

639
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,334
不過是小意外罷了，別緊張
Accident. Stay cool.

640
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,755
不
No!

641
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,262
雙手舉高
Put your hands up.

642
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:39,556
特洛
Troy!

643
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,280
特洛
Troy?

644
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,909
我沒事
I』m okay.

645
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,828
趴下
-Chief.
-Get down.

646
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,378
趴下…
Shut up! Get down!

647
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,630
Get down! Shut up.

648
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,390
帶這些人上吉普車
-Put the people in the Humvee.
- What?

649
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,888
什麼？
帶這些人上吉普車
Put the people in the Humvee.

650
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,578
坐不下的
那就想想辦法
-There's no room.
- Make room.

651
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,105
你說的「需要」怎麼了？
What happened to necessity?

652
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,940
情況改變了
It just changed!

653
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,109
我不這麼認為，走吧
Not for me. Let's go!

654
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,441
如果剛剛的事
發生在你身上怎麼辦？
如果是你呢？
-What if that was you?
-What if this was you without Kevlar?

655
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,863
Hey! Hey.

656
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,537
好極了，還有坦克車
Great, a fucking tank.

657
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,372
我們這會兒慘了
That should send us on our way.

658
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,084
要開火嗎，長官？
L.A.W., sir?

659
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,587
不，咱們離開這裡吧
No, let's get out of here.

660
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,423
早該走了
It』s about fucking time!

661
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:59,177
快上車吧
Ride in that Humvee. Let's go!
Let's go! In the Humvee.

662
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:05,139
快…
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, come on, come on.

663
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,478
Hurry up.

664
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,773
Let's go.

665
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,504
你瘋啦，薩達姆會殺你的
你這個大笨蛋
我們本來已經沒事了
Stupid son of a bitch.
We were home free!

666
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,423
讓我看看你的手
Give me that arm.

667
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,970
那架坦克在做什麼？
What's that tank doing?

668
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,558
我不知道，好像停了
I don't know. Looks like it stopped.

669
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,588
他讓他們把黃金和犯人帶走

670
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:56,958
他們破壞了停火協定
快想想辦法

671
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:27,974
Mortar!

672
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,480
是毒氣彈
It』s gas!

673
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,498
我的防毒面罩呢？
Where's my mask?

674
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,876
我的防毒面罩呢？
Where's my fucking mask?

675
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,881
我的防毒面罩呢？
Where's my mask?

676
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,008
特洛
Mine!

677
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,262
不要跑…
Hey, stop! Stop!

678
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:33,058
等等，有地雷
Hey! Wait! Those are mines!

679
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,938
快回來
Come back this way!

680
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,150
不要跑
Hey, stop!

681
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:07,425
這不是沙林毒氣
否則我們早就死了
No, no, no, this isn't sarin.
We'd be dead already.

682
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,132
那這是什麼，摧淚瓦斯嗎？
- It』s C.S. Come on.
對，來吧
- What is it, mustard?

683
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:15,058
沒錯，他們抓走拜隆了
- Tear gas?
- Yeah, times 10.

684
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,231
過來，把這戴上
Come here. Come here. Put this on.

685
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,817
你拿去戴吧
Here, you take it.

686
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,362
這裡有地雷，不要走那邊
You see that? That's a mine!
Come here.

687
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:33,839
遮住你的臉
Don't step there. Do not step there.
Where's your kids?

688
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,705
過來，你的孩子呢？
Cover your face. Come here.

689
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,999
Where are your children?

690
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,084
你的孩子怎麼了？
What happened to your children?

691
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:45,839
小心後面
Watch your back!

692
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:48,717
不要動
Freeze! Don't move!

693
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,303
怎麼回事？
我不知道
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

694
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:00,061
不要緊的，他們是來幫我們的
他們是反抗軍
It』s okay. They're helping us.
They're with the rebels.

695
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,105
他們附近有地方可以躲
They got a shelter.

696
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:04,941
Tunnel.

697
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,239
快進去
Go, go. Get in!

698
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,491
我去找拜隆
I gotta look for Barlow.

699
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,076
特洛呢？
Where's Troy?

700
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,537
特洛呢？
Wait a minute! Where's Troy?

701
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,498
我們快點離開這裡
Hey, man. We gotta get out of here.

702
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,042
特洛呢？
快來
Where is Troy?

703
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,960
別碰我
- Come on!
- Get off me!

704
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,630
我們進去吧
Let's go.

705
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:34,804
You motherfucker.
Get the fuck off me!

706
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,615
拜隆
Barlow?

707
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,249
拜隆

708
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,988
你們在搞什麼鬼？
Get the fuck off me.

709
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,784
我們要去找特洛
We have to go back and get Troy.

710
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,286
他不在上面
等摧淚瓦斯散了再說
He's not out there.
We have to wait till it clears.

711
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,831
都是你害我們損失了特洛
You made a choice in the village
and we lost Troy.

712
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:48,548
我沒有選擇
才怪
我別無選擇
-I had no choice.
-You had a choice!
I had no choice.

713
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:52,549
那特洛呢？
他現在有什麼選擇？
What about Troy?
What choice does he have now?

714
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,259
我們能打死他嗎？

715
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,199
我們不該扣留美國人

716
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,939
他們破壞了停火協定

717
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,899
叛軍在搶坦克

718
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,271
快點開始拍
Paco, start shooting!

719
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,858
我覺得情況不妙
我們最好趕快離開
I don't like this. We should go.

720
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,986
讓我來處理
Let me handle this.

721
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,795
快穿衣服
知道了
-Get dressed! Get dressed!
- Okay.

722
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,046
快穿衣服
我說我知道了
I said okay!

723
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,321
Fuck!

724
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,454
你會說英文嗎？
會
-Do you speak English?
-Yes.

725
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,584
我遇上麻煩了，我要…
-Could you--?
-Yes, sir?

726
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,836
I have a little problem.

727
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,421
請問你要接幾號？
I need to know the number.
What number, please?

728
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,173
「沙漠風暴」行動
Operation Desert Storm.

729
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,133
對不起，你說什麼？
I』m sorry? I need to know the number.

730
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,719
幫我接沙漠中的指揮中心
這是緊急事件
The big Army in the desert.
It』s an emergency.

731
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:06,778
你必須要告訴我號碼才行
你去死
-You'll have to give me more specific--
-Fuck. Maybe--

732
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,770
快點…
Come on, come on, come on.

733
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,952
喂？
Hello.
-Honey, it's me.

734
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:26,264
親愛的，是我
Troy? Aah!

735
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:31,328
特洛？我的天啊
我正希望你會打來呢
Oh, my God! Oh, baby,
I was hoping it was you.

736
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,456
是我，親愛的
-It』s me, honey.
寶寶哭了
-Oh, God, the baby's crying.

737
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,461
她還好嗎？
How's she doing?

738
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:40,296
她睡的不太安穩
go back to work, so I』m real tired, baby.
我媽回去上班了
所以我現在很累
She hasn't slept good, and Mom had to

739
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:44,258
我真希望我能幫得上忙，寶貝
你何時回來？
-I wish I was there to help, gooney bird.
-When are you coming home?

740
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,222
我正在設法，親愛的
Well, I』m working on that right now.

741
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,559
我看到報上有電腦公司在徵人
要不要幫你安排面試？
I saw an ad for a computer job.
You want me to set up an interview?

742
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,266
聽著，親愛的…
你什麼時候回來？
-Listen, honey--
-What date are you coming home?

743
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,188
他們還沒有告訴我們
確切的日期
They haven't given us
an exact date yet--

744
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,316
如果我知道你哪天會回來
我可以幫你安排…
If I knew,
I could set up this interview--

745
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,982
親愛的，求求你聽我說
怎麼了？
-Listen to me, please.
-What's happening?

746
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,209
那是什麼？
牆壁爆炸了
-What was that?
-The wall just exploded.

747
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,489
戰爭不是結束了嗎？
I thought the war was over.

748
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,242
還沒有，幫我個忙
打電話給後備軍人指揮中心
It is and it isn't.
Could you call the reserve center?

749
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,619
你要我怎麼做？
What do you want me to do?

750
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,497
告訴他們，我被困在
卡拉巴北方223的碉堡中
Tell the duty NCO I』m stuck in a bunker
near 223 north outside Karbala.

751
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,751
卡拉巴北方223
Two-two-three north outside Karbala.

752
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:18,208
你沒事吧？
別擔心我
-You're okay? Everything's okay?
-I don't want you to worry.

753
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,840
我正在想辦法為我們家籌些錢
I tried to do something
for the family, and....

754
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,426
我只想告訴你…
告訴我什麼？
-I just want you to know--
-Know what?

755
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,094
我愛你
告訴我到底怎麼了？
-I love you.
-What's going on?

756
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,804
告訴克莉絲，我也愛她
-Just tell Krystal.
-Troy.

757
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,680
告訴克莉絲，我們發財了
Tell Krystal I』m a rich man and if things
如果一切順利
她就不愁吃穿了
work out, she'll be taken care of.

758
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,977
我得掛了，親愛的，我愛你
What are you talking about?

759
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,189
-I gotta go, gooney bird! I love you!
-What's going on?

760
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,900
Troy? Troy?

761
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,284
軍營中一片歡欣鼓舞
Spirits are high
and the music is soaring...

762
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:55,037
年輕的士兵們，正在慶祝成功解放科威特
...as these young troops
celebrate the liberation of Kuwait.

763
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,962
我現在被困在一個…
該死的，等等
The mood here is boisterous and giddy,
as these troops are--

764
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,090
I』m being held by a bunker outside--
Shit! Wait!

765
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:06,970
我現在被伊拉克人
扣押在佈滿砂礫的卡拉巴…
I』m being held captive by Iraqi troops
outside a bunker near the gritty city--

766
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,390
等等…你又說了砂礫
Cut, cut! You said "gritty city" again.

767
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,768
誰管我說了什麼
這些人就要死了
Who gives a shit what I said?
These people are dying, for chrissake!

768
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,314
華特怎辦？
-What about Private Wogaman, Adriana?
- Let's lay one down first.

769
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,445
我們先報新聞再說，3，2…
I』m being held captive by Iraqi troops....
In three, two....

770
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:21,730
我被伊拉克軍隊扣押在卡拉巴軍營

771
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,488
Okay. Okay. Okay.

772
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:26,906
反抗軍已經…
The rebels have gone down the road....

773
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,074
那是NBS的記者
Okay.

774
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,939
她本人看起來矮多了

775
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,369
快把她帶開

776
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:37,634
這次攻擊行動，顯然是由卡拉巴叛軍發動的
Now, the assault, started by
the rebels from Karbala, came up on--

777
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:39,108
退後

778
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,504
別鬧了
Hey, back off! Hey, hey! No!

779
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,145
我們有權到這裡來
Sir, that's enough!
-We have a right to be here!

780
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:46,259
那是我的
去死吧
That's mine.

781
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:47,427
華特
-Yes.
- No.

782
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,429
麻煩把褲子還給我，好嗎？
Yes. Fuck it. Walter?

783
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,973
我要我的褲子
-Could I have my pants, please?
- Walter?

784
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,058
快走
華特…
- My pants, on my legs.
- Go!

785
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,935
快走
Walter?

786
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,022
快離開這裡
- Go!
- Out! Get out!

787
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,109
你小時候希望以後能當什麼？
What did you wanna be as a little boy?

788
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,280
我小時候想當獸醫或神槍手
As a boy, I wanted to be either
a veterinarian or a CIA sharpshooter.

789
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:08,935
真的？真複雜
-Really? That's very complicated.
- Doug?

790
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,109
道格
什麼事？
Yes, colonel.

791
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,288
你在搞什麼鬼？
我在接受NRG的訪問
-What the fuck are you doing?
- I』m giving an interview to NRG.

792
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,332
你有沒有得到批准？
有的
-Do you have authorization?
-Yes, sir, I do.

793
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,797
不行
不行？
No.

794
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:26,466
-No?
-No.

795
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,259
這是誰給你的？
蓋特少校
-Who gave you this?
-Major Gates.

796
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,221
這是艾奇蓋特給你的？
我的天啊，道格
Archie Gates gave you this?
Jesus Christ, Doug.

797
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:36,028
我不能接受訪問嗎？
不行
-I don't get to do the interview?
-No, you don't get to do the interview.

798
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,435
跟我來
Come with me.

799
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,565
你告訴我他在哪裡
否則我送你回旅館
Tell me where he is, or you're going
back to the hotel in Dhahran.

800
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:45,276
我不知道他在哪裡
他不是去了幫愛德安娜嗎？
I don't know. I think
he's helping Adriana Cruz.

801
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,861
她在不在這裡？
不在
-Is she here?
- No, sir.

802
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,362
還有誰不見了？
So who else is missing?

803
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,239
契夫不見了
契夫不見了？
-Chief's not here.
- Chief's not here?

804
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,825
你不知道你的部下在哪裡嗎？
You don't know where
your staff sergeant is, captain?

805
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,577
拜隆和維克也不見了
Barlow and Vig are gone too, sir.

806
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,789
他們昨天在某個傢伙的屁股裡
找到一張文件
They got a document
out of a guy's ass yesterday, sir.

807
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,665
什麼？
What?

808
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,689
我不知道那是什麼
好像是地圖或是秘密名冊
我親眼看到的
I don't know what it was. Some map
or secret list. But I saw it happen.

809
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,005
他們有沒有拿來給你看？
沒有
-Did they bring it to you?
-No, sir.

810
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,466
我就知道他在搞鬼
Yeah, see, he's working something.

811
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,865
幫我找些地圖來
Get me some maps.
Check radio transmissions.

812
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,999
檢查一下無線電通訊
也許能找出他們的位置
Maybe we'll get their positions.

813
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,830
他怎麼了？他死了嗎？
What's wrong with him? Is he dead?

814
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,749
他死了嗎？
你們要帶他到哪裡去？
Is that guy dead?
Where are you gonna put him?

815
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,918
我們帶他到神廟去
A shrine.

816
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:28,754
神廟？你們這裡有什麼樣的神廟？
A shrine? What kind of shrine y'all got?

817
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,464
聖人的神廟，能夠撫慰他
並帶他到天堂去
A shrine near a holy man...

818
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,468
...that gives him comfort
and access to paradise.

819
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:39,223
這個神廟聽起來蠻不錯
對不對？
Hey, that sounds like
a pretty good shrine, right, chief?

820
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,060
我說真的，聽起來真的很好
I』m not kidding.
It sounds like a good shrine.

821
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,773
很抱歉，我不該打你
我只是很擔心特洛
Hey, man, I』m sorry I hit you.

822
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:54,610
他是我朋友，我不希望他出事
I was just worried about Troy,
you know. He's my friend.
I didn't want nothing
to happen to him.

823
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:58,784
他說要帶我到底特律去，幫我找工作
He's gonna take me to Detroit
with him, hook me up with a job.

824
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,578
別生氣了嘛
Come on, man. Chief.

825
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,460
我知道你是來幫我的
I know you was coming to help me.

826
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,052
我不希望，我們兩人之間有任何不快
Thanks. I don't wanna hold no grudges.

827
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:19,639
你是不是喪失了自己的信仰？
You got kicked out of that
ring of Jesus fire, huh?

828
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,807
不是這樣的
That ain't how it work.

829
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,185
那是怎樣？
How's it work?

830
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:28,060
不管他讓我面臨任何困境，我都坦然處之
完全沒有任何疑問
I take care of whatever he puts
in front of me, no questions asked.

831
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,733
他讓我找到了黃金
所以我就拿了
He put that gold in front of me,
and I took it.

832
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,902
就是這樣
That's how it works.

833
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:34,987
那現在呢？
What about now?

834
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,990
我不知道，靜觀其變吧
I don't know. I gotta see.

835
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:45,739
你還好嗎，康拉德？
-I』m fine.
我沒事
-How you doing, Conrad?

836
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,377
今天的事是我造成的
It was my choice today.

837
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:53,965
你可以回去拿你的黃金
把它埋了
You can try and head back if you want.
Take your share and bury it.

838
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,550
我自己去找拜隆
I'll find Barlow myself.

839
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:00,179
我也要去找特洛
I wanna find Troy.

840
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,431
我隨時準備出發
I』m here. I』m ready.

841
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,606
我們先看看皮箱裡的東西吧
Let's check the suitcases.

842
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,448
一共有79個
I count 79.

843
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,368
這表示少了41袋
That means we're missing 41 bags.

844
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:25,079
這樣一共有2300百萬
收穫還不錯
That's about $23 million left.

845
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:30,872
不過我們當然要找到拜隆
而且不受到軍法審判才行
Not bad for a disaster, provided we find
Barlow and not get court-martialed.

846
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,253
她還好吧？
How is she?

847
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:36,309
你女兒還好吧？
Hey. How is your little girl?

848
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,135
她嚇壞了
She's traumatized.
What do you expect?

849
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:43,597
我在美國念過商學院
I went to B-school
at Bowling Green, okay?

850
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,892
我回來是想在這裡開飯店
I came back to open
a couple of hotels near Karbala.

851
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,895
在這場愚笨的戰爭開始之前
我幾乎要轉虧為盈了
I』m nearly in the black
when this stupid war starts...

852
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,398
你們卻來炸了我的餐廳
...and you guys bomb all my cafes.

853
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,400
現在我們想要反抗薩達姆
布希卻棄我們於不顧
Now we try to get rid of Saddam...

854
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,185
...Bush leaves us twisting in the winds.
Unbelievable.

855
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,029
看看這些人
美國為何不伸出援手？

856
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,244
Look at these people.
Where is America now?

857
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,121
美軍為何不來幫我們？
Where is the Army now?

858
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,960
你們有無線電嗎？
-Do you have a radio?
- No.

859
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:14,920
沒有無線電，也沒有水
No radio, no water.

860
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,758
拜隆呢？
他被他們抓走了
-Where's Barlow?
- They got him.

861
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,426
他們會帶他到哪裡去？
綠洲碉堡
Where would they take him?

862
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,637
那裡的戒備森嚴
Oasis bunker.
It』s full of Saddam's Republican Guard.

863
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,766
碉堡在什麼地方？
離這裡18英哩左右
Where's that?
-Approximately 17, 18 miles from here.

864
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:28,976
帶我們去
我們沒有交通工具
Take us there.
-We have no transportation.

865
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,929
那就用走的
直到找到車輛為止
你們為何不聯絡海軍？
We'll walk till we find some.
-Why don't you call in the Marines?

866
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,232
怎麼聯絡？我們又沒有無線電
-With what? We don't have a radio.
- Okay.

867
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:40,150
我們幫你找輛車
你開回軍營去找架直升機
幫我們找幫手來
We'll find a vehicle, you drive back,
get a helicopter, fly in, get your man.

868
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,823
礙難從命
為何？你們有大軍駐紮
We can't do that.
-Why not? You have a huge Army here.

869
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,950
我們不該捲入你們的內政
We shouldn't be involved
in the uprising.

870
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,496
我們打死了伊拉克士兵
已經違反了停火協議
We killed Iraqi soldiers,
broke the peace accord.

871
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,122
你知道我是怎麼想的嗎？
你們在偷黃金
You know what I think?

872
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:55,319
我們為了反抗薩達姆，傷亡慘重
你們卻在偷黃金
You're stealing gold. We're fighting Saddam
and dying, and you're stealing gold.

873
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,670
你錯了
You're wrong.

874
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,756
有50萬美軍駐紮在此
卻只派了你們4個來拿黃金？
They have half a million men here.

875
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,343
They send four guys
to pick up all this bullion?

876
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,178
我看不是吧
I don't think so.

877
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:10,628
我們一定要找到我們的人
你要多少黃金
才肯幫我們的忙？
We need to find our man.
How much do you want to take us to him?

878
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,312
你有什麼資格分配黃金？
Is this still yours to give? Huh?

879
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,982
你們能拿到黃金
是因為有我們幫忙
The only reason you have these bags
is my people picked them up.

880
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,068
我們會拿屬於我們的份
幫你們搬運你們的
We'll take our share...

881
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,987
...and we will help you
carry your share.

882
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,241
還要幫我們找到我們的弟兄
And find our man.

883
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:29,870
我叫做艾米爾阿布杜拉
Amir Abdulah.

884
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,998
我是艾奇蓋特
Archie Gates.

885
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,528
你們要帶我們到伊朗邊境
什麼？
-You'll take us to the Iranian border.
-What?

886
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,329
要是我們不趕快到難民營的話
就死定了
最近的難民營在伊朗境內
If we don't get to a refugee camp,
we are dead. The nearest is in Iran.

887
01:02:40,424 --> 01:02:42,174
你不需要我們
你們可以買通一條出路
You don't need us. Buy your way.

888
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,261
薩達姆的士兵不會拿這些黃金
No. Saddam's soldiers
will never take Saddam's gold.

889
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,763
我們只有跟著美國人，才有活命的希望
Our only chance
is if we are with Americans.

890
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:51,308
我們不能帶你們到伊朗邊境
那我們也不能幫你們的忙
-We can't take you to the Iranian border.
-Then we don't have a deal.

891
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:54,103
少來這套
我們救了你們一命
-Give me a fucking break, man.
-We just saved your life!

892
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,564
我們也救了你們
我們為了你們損失了一名弟兄
-And we saved yours.
-We lost a man for you.

893
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:59,984
把我們丟在這裡任人宰割
對你們有什麼好處
What good is it if you leave us here
to be slaughtered, huh?

894
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:04,447
民主大軍打敗了醜陋的獨栽者
解救了富有的科威特人
The big Army of democracy beats the ugly
dictator and saves the rich Kuwaitis...

895
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:09,326
而你們會因為幫助我們
逃離獨栽者的魔掌而坐牢嗎？
...but you go to jail if you help us
escape the same dictator?

896
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:14,540
你們也看到我太太的下場
You saw what happened to my wife.

897
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,709
看看我的女兒
Look at my daughter.

898
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,465
多少人要去？
Who's going?

899
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,217
除了神父外，大家都去
一共55個人
Everyone but the priests. That makes 55.

900
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,774
我們有從吉普車上搶救什麼下來嗎？
Did we save anything from the Humvee?

901
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:44,236
有，維克的包包
Yeah. Vig's bag.

902
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,784
好極了
Lovely.

903
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,247
你是什麼軍階？
What is your rank, bro?

904
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,166
一等兵
Sergeant first class.

905
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,918
哪個連？
Your company?

906
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,505
美國後備軍人437連
437 Civil Affairs Company,
U.S. Army Reserve.

907
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:06,759
好朋友，告訴我一件事
My main man...

908
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,095
...tell me something, okay?

909
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,641
麥可傑克森到底是怎麼回事？
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

910
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,477
你這話什麼意思？
What do you mean?

911
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:28,238
麥可傑克森到底是怎麼回事？
麥可傑克森到底是怎麼回事？
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

912
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,533
你不懂我的問題嗎？
You understand my question?

913
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,118
我不太懂
No, I』m not sure I do.

914
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,164
流行樂之王
The King of Pop. Woo-hoo. Hee, hee.

915
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:38,624
麥可傑克森
Yeah, Michael Jackson.

916
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,460
他到埃及來了
我在報上看到他的照片
He come to Egypt.
I see picture in newspaper.

917
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:45,627
他帶著白手套跟大家打招呼
"I』m Michael Jackson in my hotel room...
「我是一天到晚整容的麥可傑克森」
"Hello," with the white glove.

918
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:50,258
你們國家逼他去整容
...with my chop-up face."
Your country make him chop up his face.

919
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:51,637
應該不是這樣吧
I don't think so.

920
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:55,182
麥可傑克森是你們這個變態國家的流行樂之王
Michael Jackson is pop king
of sick fucking country.

921
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,560
放屁，他是自願的
That's bullshit. He did it to himself.

922
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,359
我看在放屁的人是你
You are the blind bullshit, my main man.

923
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:07,778
這事再明顯不過了
It is so obvious a black man...

924
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,657
黑人漂白皮膚，洗直頭髮
你知道為何嗎？
...make the skin white and the hair
straight, and you know why?

925
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,284
不知道
No.

926
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,996
你們這個變態國家，逼得黑人自我嫌惡
Your sick fucking country
make the black man hate himself...

927
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,791
就像你們恨這裡被你們
轟炸的阿拉伯人和孩子們一樣
...just like you hate the Arab
and the children you bomb over here.

928
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,668
我不恨小孩
I don't hate children.

929
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:26,229
大戰已經結束了
你這樣做不合法
所以你也已經犯法了
-This is illegal. The war's over.
-That's why you are illegal.

930
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:29,341
你們破壞停火協議，而且還偷了黃金
You broke the ceasefire,
and I think maybe even you steal the gold.

931
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:33,178
所以沒有人知道
你們現在在這裡
So nobody know where you are, right?
Your Army don't know.

932
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:37,433
我可以把你送到巴格達去
永遠不會有人找到你
I』m gonna send you to Baghdad
for a long time. Nobody found you.

933
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,189
他們關心嗎？
誰？
-Do they care, buddy?
-Does who care?

934
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:48,149
美軍關心伊拉克的孩子嗎？
他們有回來幫忙嗎？
Do your Army care about the children
in Iraq? Do they come back to help?

935
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,654
不，他們不會來的
No, they're not coming.

936
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,253
你的軍隊是不是回來
幫助反抗軍？
Do your Army...

937
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:09,169
不會
-...come back to help the people?
- No.

938
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,258
說實話吧
Tell the truth, dude-ski.

939
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,260
免得吃苦頭
Save us the big bummer.

940
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,220
我說的都是實話
That's the truth.

941
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,419
會不會痛？
Does it hurt?

942
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,632
我剛問你會不會痛？
I asked you a question, man.
Does it hurt?

943
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,425
很痛
Yes, it hurts.

944
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,471
你們轟炸了我的家人
你知道嗎？
You bomb my family. Do you know that?

945
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,101
你們夷平了我住的那條街
You blow up my home. The whole street.

946
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,813
我太太被大塊水泥
砸的血肉模糊
My wife is crushed by
big fucking block of concrete.

947
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,273
她失去了雙腿
She lose her legs.

948
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,151
她的雙腿已經被切除了
Those legs cut off now.

949
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,779
真是太可怕了
什麼？
That's horrible.
-What?

950
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,407
我說那太可怕了
I said that's horrible.

951
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:20,577
我還沒說到可怕的部份呢
Oh, my God, buddy. I didn't even
told you the horrible part yet.

952
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,457
我兒子在床上被活活炸死
My son....

953
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,502
My son was killed in his bed.

954
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,465
他才一歲大
He is 1 years old.

955
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,301
抱著玩具睡覺時卻被炸死了
He is sleeping with his toy
when the bomb come.

956
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,307
我有個女兒
I have a daughter.

957
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,852
你真好命
Very nice for you, bro.

958
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,228
她安全的住在亞歷桑那
She's safe in Arizona...

959
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,395
不用擔心從天而降的
炸彈和水泥塊
...without the bomb, the concrete
and all this shit.

960
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,192
我不是亞歷桑那人
I』m not from Arizona.

961
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,571
她多大了？
How old is she?

962
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,532
一個月大
One month old.

963
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,617
她叫什麼名字？
What's her name?

964
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,871
克莉絲
Krystal.

965
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:08,000
你為何要告訴我這些？
What make you decide to tell me
about Krystal, my main man?

966
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,503
因為我們兩個都為人父
Because we're both fathers.

967
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,007
我已經不是父親了，記得嗎？
我兒子已經死了
I』m not father no more, dude.
Remember?

968
01:08:15,467 --> 01:08:17,801
My son is dead now.

969
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,599
如果我去轟炸你的女兒
你會有何感覺？
Can you think how it feel
inside your heart...

970
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,768
...if I bomb your daughter?

971
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:32,649
我會覺得痛不欲生
Worse than death.

972
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:39,009
你說的對
痛不欲生
That's right. Worse than death.

973
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:11,838
你們都認為美國很邪惡
對不對？
你們認為美國是撒旦？
Y'all think America is Satan, right?
America is Satan?

974
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,235
他們說什麼？
What'd they say?

975
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,403
他們說希望能開一家理髮廳
They say he want salon.

976
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,907
什麼？
理髮廳
-A what?
-A salon. Hair salon.

977
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,325
你會剪頭髮？
You cut hair?

978
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,369
對
-Yes.
-Yes, yes.

979
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:30,668
他們才不管自己的客戶
是美國人，什葉派教徒
還是回教徒
Look, they don't care if they cut
American hair, Shiite hair, Sunni hair.

980
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:36,255
他們只想逃離海珊的暴政
然後過著平靜的生活
They just want get rid of Saddam
and live life. Make business.

981
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:43,595
他想知道你們是不是要殺光
所有的阿拉伯人
He wants to know,
do you want to kill every Arab?

982
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,264
我們受訓的時候是這樣學的
That's what I was trained to do.

983
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:49,351
不，不是這樣的
我們也有阿拉伯盟國
No. That was not our training.
We got Arab allies, man.

984
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,228
沒錯，我們有阿拉伯盟國
Yeah, well, we got Arab allies.

985
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,276
他說「所以你們不想
殺光阿拉人羅？」
He says, "So you don't want to
kill every Arab."

986
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,695
他沒有念過高中
-Well, not--
-He's just had no high school.

987
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,780
別到處宣揚
-No high school.
-Don't tell people that.

988
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:12,040
他們說什麼？
說你的髮型糟透了
-What'd they say?
-He says you have terrible haircut.

989
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,878
這是特洛幫我剪的，很酷呢
Troy gave me this haircut.
It』s a badass haircut.

990
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:18,255
Yeah!

991
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,552
美國萬歲
America!

992
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:27,681
美國萬歲
-America!
-America!

993
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,146
歡迎美國人
America, welcome.

994
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,969
Welcome, America! Welcome!

995
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:15,687
Major Gates.

996
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,148
你好
他在問候你們
-How you doing?
-He says, "How are you?"

997
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:19,858
他很高興有美國人來
He's happy to welcome America.

998
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,860
謝謝
我們歡迎美國人
-Thank you.
-We welcome America.

999
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,572
他們都是海珊的逃兵
They're all deserters.
They leave Saddam army.

1000
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,283
但他們常常幫助我們
他是個大好人
-But they help us near Karbala. Good man.
-Karbala.

1001
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,577
Welcome, America.

1002
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,752
不，男人不這樣叫
只有女人會叫
No, no, my friend. The man don't do that.
Only the woman.

1003
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:44,668
為何？
這是他們的習俗
-Why's that?
-Because it's their custom.

1004
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,468
你們有沒有無線電？
沒有
-You have a radio?
- No radio.

1005
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:48,971
布希一定要現在就解決海珊
George Bush get rid Saddams now?

1006
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:52,053
不盡然
恭喜你
-Not exactly, no.
-Congratulation!

1007
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,308
恭喜你
Congratulation!

1008
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,062
麻煩你告訴他
我們需要交通工具
Would you inform this gentleman
we need a vehicle of some kind?

1009
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,250
從科威特搶來的
From Kuwait.

1010
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,602
我問你一個問題
Man, let me ask you a question.

1011
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,605
萊瑟斯有沒有這款車？
Does Lexus make this model?

1012
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,524
只有永恆有敞蓬
Infiniti convertible only.

1013
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,860
沒有萊瑟斯敞蓬車
只有永恆的
No Lexus convertible. Infiniti only.

1014
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:46,445
只有永恆有
Infiniti only.

1015
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,238
我就知道
Exactly what I said.

1016
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:52,159
我們要用這些車
來對抗海珊的軍隊
Listen. We use these cars
to fight Saddam's soldiers.

1017
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,954
有什麼好笑？
What's so funny?

1018
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,289
不能給你們
Cannot take.

1019
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:01,622
你這話什麼意思？
我們打敗了海珊
我們當然可以拿
What you mean, cannot take?
We kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely take.

1020
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,378
我們是美國軍人
We are the United States Army.

1021
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,631
你們是三個帶著一群百姓的人
而且沒有吉普車
You are three guys with a bunch
of civilians and no Humvee.

1022
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:09,760
我們沒有錢過日子
Need money. Have no money.
To eat, to live.

1023
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:16,641
美軍陣容龐大，有飛機，坦克
我們什麼都沒有
"American Army is huge. It has planes
and tanks, and we have nothing."

1024
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:20,312
聽我說，我們會一起起義反抗
告訴他
Listen to me.
We will rise up together. Tell him.

1025
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,646
起義
Rise up.

1026
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:25,229
你看看我們有許多種族
來自許多國家
Look at us. Many races.

1027
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,566
我們一起同心協力
Many nations, many nations.
Working together.

1028
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:30,322
告訴他，契夫
-Tell him, chief.
-Yes. We're united.

1029
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,944
我們很團結
團結一致
United.

1030
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,242
喬治布希需要你們
George Bush. George Bush wants you.

1031
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,744
You. You.

1032
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:37,162
你們要為自己挺身反抗
Stand up for yourself.

1033
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,500
喬治布希需要你們
他需要你，他需要大家
-George Bush?
- Wants you!

1034
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,793
- You!
- Wants you.

1035
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,002
-You!
- Yes!

1036
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,172
我們要團結起來挺身反抗
-He wants everybody.
-Yes. Me and you stand up together.

1037
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,466
我們要一起打敗海珊
We fight. Kick Saddam's ass!

1038
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:50,675
Huh?

1039
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,846
喬治布希需要你們
-George Bush wants you.
-Yes.

1040
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,264
He wants you.
-Yes.

1041
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:03,939
你們要為自己的自由而戰
要自助才會人助
He wants you!
Make the fight for freedom on your own!

1042
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,691
讚美上帝
-Then America will follow.
- Praise the Lord!

1043
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,694
天祐美國，天祐自由伊拉克
God bless America,
and God bless a free Iraq!

1044
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:15,919
自由伊拉克

1045
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:19,826
自由伊拉克
Free Iraq! Free Iraq!

1046
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:23,083
- Free Iraq! Free Iraq!
- Free Iraq!

1047
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:24,501
Free Iraq!

1048
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,461
怎麼樣？
Now, what do you say, my friend?

1049
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,213
不能給你車
Cannot give car. Ha, ha.

1050
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,383
那我們就用買的
Okay. I guess we'll buy them.

1051
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,522
別這樣，這音樂很好聽的
聽了讓你精神百倍
Come on, man. This is good music.
Man, Judas Priest will pump you up, man.

1052
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:48,775
我才不要聽這種音樂
會讓我頭痛
No! We're not listening to that
headache music. Stop.

1053
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:53,734
聽一首就好了嘛
我們應該聽輕音樂
-Just one song.
-What you need is easy-listening classics.

1054
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,532
我才不要聽
I do not need that.

1055
01:14:55,700 --> 01:15:00,241
你需要聽音樂放鬆一下
聽這種音樂才不能放鬆
-You need something to calm your nerve.
-Not easy-listening classics.

1056
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,414
聽這張
All right, try this.

1057
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:15,588
這是巴洛的太太
從底特律傳來的
這應該就是他的下落
Sir, this is from Barlow's wife in Detroit.
They may have a position on him.

1058
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,429
他太太從底特律傳來的？
From his wife in Detroit?

1059
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:20,182
這到底是怎麼回事？
What the hell is this?

1060
01:15:20,892 --> 01:15:24,978
戰爭結束了，我卻不知道
這場戰爭到底有何意義？
The war is over, and I don't fucking know
what it was about. What was this war about?

1061
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,480
我被軍方耍著玩
我也是
-I was managed by the military.
-Me too.

1062
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,483
我報新聞不是靠個人風格取勝
而是靠內容
I try to be substance-based,
not style-based.

1063
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,110
我覺得你很有格
I think you got a lot of style.

1064
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,154
那個叫凱西的小婊子說我老了
That little Cathy bitch says I』m old.

1065
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,114
那是因為她嫉妒
That's because she's jealous.

1066
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:39,826
你比她聰明讓她備受威脅
第二，你很漂亮
First of all, you are smarter than her,
and that is a threat.

1067
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:46,879
你是電視台最美麗的女人
謝謝
And second of all, you are beautiful.
You're the most prettiest woman...
-...down there at that network.
-Thank you.

1068
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:51,588
你皮膚很好，一頭秀髮
You got great skin, beautiful hair.

1069
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:54,489
你真會說話
但幹我們這一行的
就是政治角力
That's sweet, but there's
sexual politics in this business.

1070
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:58,094
最重要的三件事
就是外表，性和風格
It』s about looks, it's about sex,
it's about style.

1071
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,847
很多主播都找過我
但我不為所動
Many an anchormen came on to me.
I didn't go for it.

1072
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:04,392
我不需要
我從來不為五斗米出賣色相
I never played that game, never dropped
to my knees for an assignment.

1073
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,647
我之所以到這裡來
是因為別人沒種來
Christ, I came out to the desert because
nobody else had the fucking balls to do it.

1074
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:16,529
我從軍是為了想改善
家人的生活，買棟好房子
I only joined Saddam Hussein army
to make good living for my family.

1075
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,241
Good house.

1076
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,618
但現在卻無法脫身
Now I can't get out.

1077
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:25,413
我也是為了賺錢才從軍
I joined up for the extra cash too.

1078
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,332
我發現我太太懷孕了
Found out I was gonna have a baby.

1079
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,711
是美國人教我怎麼用武器的
You know, I got
weapon and training from America.

1080
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,213
騙人
Bullshit.

1081
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,674
你以為我的英文是怎麼學的？
Oh, yeah?
How you think I learned my English?

1082
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,425
兩伊戰爭時
美國人來教我們如何對抗伊朗
Specialist guys come here...

1083
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:40,178
...to train us when we fight Iran.

1084
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,846
他們教了你們什麼？
What'd they train you in?

1085
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:44,182
武器，秘密破壞行動，審問
Weapons, sabotage...

1086
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:45,642
...interrogation.

1087
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,144
好極了
Great.

1088
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:52,691
你們到伊拉克來打仗
一點意義都沒有
It was a total waste for your Army
to come to Iraq, right?

1089
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,610
我聽說科威特
發生了不幸的事情
I heard about a lot of bad shit
that happened in Kuwait.

1090
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,947
這種事情難免發生
我也覺得很丟臉
Yeah, bad shit happened.
I』m not proud of that.

1091
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,699
到底哪一個國家才變態？
Who's got the sick country?

1092
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,701
也許海珊瘋了
Maybe Saddam is very crazy.

1093
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,245
你們也瘋了才會轟炸伊拉克
And then you are crazy
to bomb all of Iraq.

1094
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,540
大肆轟炸的確瘋狂
但解救科威特卻很理智
Too much bombing is crazy,
but not saving Kuwait.

1095
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,335
你們是來救科威特人的？
是的
You are here for save Kuwaiti people?
-Yes.

1096
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:16,059
真的？
是的
-Really?
-Yeah.

1097
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,136
世界上有麻煩的人太多了
你們為何不幫他們出頭？
A lot of people
in trouble in this world, my man...

1098
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,555
...and you don't fight
no fucking war for them.

1099
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:27,434
你們入侵了別的國家
這是不可以的
為何不能？
-You invaded another country. Can't do that.
-Why not, dude?

1100
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,186
這樣會使世界一片混亂
我們一定要維持局勢安定
It makes the world crazy.
You need to keep it stable.

1101
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,749
為何？
為了石油嗎？
For what? Your pickup truck?

1102
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:36,026
不，是為了維持
這個區域的安定
No, for stability. Stabilize the region.

1103
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,836
這才是你要的安定
This is your fucking stability,
my main man.

1104
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,934
我們先去救我們的人
然後回來拿黃金
We get our man, and then we
come back and pick up the gold.

1105
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:13,589
還要接我們嗎？
沒錯
-And my people?
-That's right.

1106
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,190
讓我們再沙盤推演一次
Let's go over the plan.

1107
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,276
好
Let's do it.

1108
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,864
懸崖上有一個碉堡
看起來像是一座城堡
There's a bunker built into
the side of the cliff face.

1109
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:26,781
這裡有兩條路
It looks like a castle. There's a road
coming there, another one across.

1110
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:31,247
路上全是海珊的人馬
我不認為能夠壓制他們
It』s full of Saddam's Republican Guard.
Now, I don't think we can overpower them.

1111
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:32,665
太多人了
There's too many.

1112
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,579
不過他們只怕一件事
什麼事？
-But there's one thing they're afraid of.
-What's that?

1113
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,129
海珊
Saddam.

1114
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,840
我們正好可以利用這點
Then that's what we use.

1115
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,510
好，就這麼辦
Right. That's what we'll use.

1116
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:49,265
保佑我，請你保佑我
You stay with me.

1117
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,610
等等，我想再詳細的
討論一下這個計劃
Wait, hold on a minute. I wanna
go over this plan one more time.

1118
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,320
你很害怕，對吧？
You're scared, right?

1119
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,406
也許吧
Maybe.

1120
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:07,992
是這樣的，你要想辦法
做好這件讓你害怕的事
The way this works is, you do
the thing you're scared shitless of...

1121
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,746
事後再鼓起勇氣
...and you get the courage after
you do it. Not before you do it.

1122
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:16,709
這樣太笨了吧
應該是反過來才對
That's a dumb-ass way to work.
It should be the other way around.

1123
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,503
我知道
I know.

1124
01:19:18,796 --> 01:19:20,755
就是這樣
That's the way it works.

1125
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,659
海珊來了

1126
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,969
你們讓他失望，他很火大

1127
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:08,169
他要把你們全殺光

1128
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,499
他要把你們全殺光

1129
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:15,209
我的天啊

1130
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,479
他鬼扯

1131
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,879
他來了

1132
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,329
海珊來殺我們了

1133
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,891
If you leave me now

1134
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:59,604
You'll take away the biggest part of me

1135
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:07,153
No, baby, please don't go

1136
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:17,372
You'll take away the very heart of me

1137
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:25,046
No, baby, please don't go

1138
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:40,689
怎麼了？
手被刺傷了
Ow! I got a splinter.

1139
01:22:32,979 --> 01:22:36,238
你們不是海珊的人

1140
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:49,547
How could we let it slip away?

1141
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,579
該死的

1142
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,309
別跑，等等

1143
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:18,409
Jesus fire, Jesus fire, Jesus fire....

1144
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:07,899
上帝啊…

1145
01:24:09,837 --> 01:24:10,575
來吧
Come on.

1146
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:14,709
快點
Quickly, quickly.

1147
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,525
該死的
Oh, shit.

1148
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,677
你沒事吧？
You all right?

1149
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,388
天啊，你死了
Oh, shit, you're dead.

1150
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:13,008
你們這些懦夫

1151
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:16,179
快點回去打他們

1152
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:20,109
我們有直升機，我們會贏的

1153
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,497
等等…
Wait! Wait!

1154
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:35,963
該死的
Shit.

1155
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,842
快回來
Get back. Get back inside.

1156
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:53,439
艾米爾，快點
Come on. Amir, come on.

1157
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,131
- Huh? How you feel?
- Stop!

1158
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,259
I told you....

1159
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,769
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

1160
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:33,474
康拉德呢？
Where's Conrad?

1161
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,648
大家不要放鬆警戒
Keep your guard up.

1162
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,291
你沒事吧？
Barlow, are you okay?

1163
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,416
康拉德呢？
我們要怎麼回去？
Chief. Where's Conrad?
How we getting back, man?

1164
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:03,495
我們有一輛勞斯萊斯
-We got the Rolls.
- You got a Rolls?

1165
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:08,092
你們有勞斯萊斯？
對
-Yeah.
-Hey. Hey.

1166
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:11,804
這是一輛永恆敞蓬車
This is an Infiniti convertible.

1167
01:29:13,432 --> 01:29:14,890
你不是被嚇呆了嗎？
Man, I think you're in shock.

1168
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:20,767
這是一輛永恆敞蓬車
對不對？
-It』s an Infiniti convertible, isn't it?
對
- Yeah, it is.

1169
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:23,274
就算我欠你一輛車
我可沒被嚇呆
Okay, so I owe you a car.
I』m not in shock.

1170
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:24,817
你沒事吧
You sure you're okay?

1171
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:26,527
不要動
Hey, freeze!

1172
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:29,238
不，他是跟我們一道兒的
No! He's with us!

1173
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,949
別開槍，他是我們的人
Don't shoot him. He's with us!

1174
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:35,286
你是那個帶著小女孩的人？
沒錯
You're the guy with the little girl?
-That's right.

1175
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,704
你在這裡做什麼？
What are you doing here?

1176
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,623
是他幫我們找到你的
我是來救你的
He helped us find you.
-I came here to help you.

1177
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,960
你真是個大好人
All right. You're all right, man.

1178
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,923
我看到有人
但看不出在幹嘛，你不要動
I see some people.

1179
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,134
I can't see what's happening. Stay put.

1180
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,887
你女兒好嗎？
她暫時沒事
-How's your little girl?
-She's safe for now.

1181
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:55,389
好極了，我們能怎麼幫你們？
Outstanding, excellent.
How can we help you?

1182
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,788
你們說好要送我們到邊境去
不過現在人數增加了
我們需要更多車子
We had a deal to get to the border, but now
we have more people and need vehicles.

1183
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,771
沒問題，我們會想辦法的
That's not a problem.
We'll work it out.

1184
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:04,148
我們一定要救他們，沒問題的
We have to do this.
We can work it out, okay?

1185
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,941
他們人很多耶
I don't know. It』s a lot of people.

1186
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:09,065
那你去告訴他們
我們只能帶一些人
Okay, well, then you choose who we take.
Tell the others they're gonna have to die...

1187
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:15,034
其他人就只有在這裡等死
你去說，我說不出口
...because I can't do that.
-You're gonna have to do it yourself.
- Okay, okay.

1188
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,328
Okay.

1189
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:24,919
你逃出來了
-Troy! You made it, man!
- Conrad!

1190
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,420
我就知道是你
I thought that was you.

1191
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,798
你死到哪裡去了？
Where the fuck have you been?

1192
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:34,678
康拉德
Conrad!

1193
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:50,111
你穿的是什麼？
什麼？
-What are you wearing?
- What?

1194
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,612
這是什麼衣服？
What is this?

1195
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,657
這是伊拉克人給我的外套
Oh, it's a suit jacket.
The Iraqis gave it to me.

1196
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:57,614
你穿這樣我都認不出來了
還蠻合身的
是啊
-I didn't recognize you in it.
-It fits all right, right?

1197
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:00,162
契夫，快來幫忙
-Yeah.
-Hey, chief! We need your help!

1198
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,919
我沒事
- I』m okay.
他被擊中哪裡？
- Where's he hit?

1199
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:06,961
子彈穿過去了
我想應該就在鎖骨上方
It』s in and out. I think
it's just above his collarbone.

1200
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,839
上帝呢？
Where's the Jesus fire?

1201
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,716
他正在保佑你，你不會有事的
It』s all around you right now.
You're gonna be all right.

1202
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:15,899
- I』m going to hell.
我會下地獄的
-You're gonna be all right, man.

1203
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,721
你不會有事的
You're gonna be fine.

1204
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:22,101
你能不能帶我到神廟去
洗清我的罪惡？
Can you take me to a shrine that gives you
comfort and erases the bad things you did?

1205
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,937
你今天做了正確的抉擇
-Hey. We made the right choice today.
- Shh, shh.

1206
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,815
別再提神廟的事了
你不會有事的
You stop with that shrine shit.
Everything'll be okay.

1207
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:30,109
真的嗎？
當然是真的
You think so?
-I know so!

1208
01:31:30,277 --> 01:31:31,485
我們要快點離開這裡
We're getting out of here. Hey, major!

1209
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:35,549
少校，你能不能來幫幫…
Would you please fucking help--?

1210
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:37,783
該死的
Goddamn it!

1211
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,122
特洛？
Troy.

1212
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,097
怎麼了？
What's the matter, man?

1213
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:06,319
你能呼吸嗎？
你能呼吸嗎？
Can you breathe?

1214
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:39,136
他的胸腔裡充滿了空氣
壓迫到肺部
There's air in his chest.
It』s crushing his lung.

1215
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,265
這樣好一點了嗎？
-Does that feel better, man?
Mm-hm.

1216
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,851
好點了嗎？
-That feel better?
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1217
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,402
他死了
He's gone.

1218
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,324
每隔15分鐘就要放氣一次
Air pressure's gonna build up
about every 15 minutes.

1219
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:44,243
打開氣門再關上
Release the valve
and close it back up.

1220
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,163
我要這樣做多久？
我不知道
-How long can I keep doing that?
-I don't know.

1221
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:53,659
如果出血不嚴重的
四，五個小時吧
你看來並沒有嚴重失血
Maybe four or five hours, if you're not
bleeding too bad. You don't seem to be.

1222
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,673
他說過想去神廟
He said he wanted
to go to one of those shrines.

1223
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,259
他是當真的嗎？
Did he mean that?

1224
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:44,219
他是這麼說的
That's what he told me.

1225
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,015
我們可以帶他到伊朗的庫姆去
Qum in Iran. We can take him with us.

1226
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,893
那就帶他去吧
Then take him.

1227
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:55,856
好，帶他去
All right. We'll take him there.

1228
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:17,029
爸爸

1229
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:38,482
我們在裡面找到無線電
已經幫你設定好了
We found a radio inside.
You're hooked for that call, major.

1230
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,162
波羅，我是貝爾小白兔
Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1231
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:53,997
我們會坐牢的
We're going to jail.

1232
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:58,079
不會的
波羅，我是貝爾小白兔
No, we're not. Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1233
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,167
這是波羅，請說
你在哪裡？
-This is Bolo. Come in.
-Where are you?

1234
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:03,507
離軍營兩公里處
About two clicks outside of camp.

1235
01:36:03,675 --> 01:36:05,384
我們準備要到薔薇道
We're ready for that briar patch.

1236
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:09,959
我只想知道我們要上哪兒去
-Ma'am, please. I』m transmitting code here!
別吵，我正在想辦法解讀密碼
-I wanna find out where we're going.

1237
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:13,399
你懂了嗎，波羅？
應該吧
-You got me, Bolo?
-I think so.

1238
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:16,019
薔薇道是誰負責的？
Who handles the briar patch?

1239
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:18,188
是你
-You do.
-Oh, okay.

1240
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:21,233
如果一切順利的話
塔兒寶貝就要到薔薇道去
Tar Baby goes to the briar patch
if everything's okay, right?

1241
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,944
不，你說反了
-No, it's the other way around.
-Right.

1242
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,030
對不起，長官，我忘了密碼
I』m sorry, sir. I don't remember
how the code goes.

1243
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:30,659
我需要四輛卡車和一輛吉普車
I need four personnel trucks
and a Humvee.

1244
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,912
這恐怕有點困難
That's a pretty tall order
for a secret operation, sir.

1245
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:38,375
告訴我的朋友提伯
每一名駕駛都會拿到十萬元
Talk to my friend Teebaux.
Each driver will get 100K.

1246
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:40,294
貝爾小白兔的位置
在北方239處
Brer Rabbit at 239 north.

1247
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:44,381
別忘了帶急救箱來
還有那個記者
Add one medevac pack to the order.
Make sure you bring the reporter.

1248
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:46,592
沒問題，給我兩小時
Roger. Give me two hours.

1249
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:55,659
這是你的，小心藏好

1250
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,932
把黃金埋好，契夫
Bury those real good, chief.

1251
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:39,937
們帶這些人越過國界後
再想辦法來拿這些黃金
After we take these people to the border,
we'll figure out a way to get it out of here.

1252
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:44,107
他太太說他在北方223
但現在那個碉堡空無一人
Two-two-three north is the position his wife
called in. There's an empty bunker.

1253
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,860
派直升機到附近去巡邏
Task air recon to cover
223 north to the border.

1254
01:37:47,028 --> 01:37:50,781
準備好直升機隨時待命
如果他們在那裡
應該很容易找到
I'll put choppers on standby.
-If they're there, they won't be hard to find.

1255
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,783
知道了，長官
All the way, sir.

1256
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:22,563
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

1257
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,440
不是我，幫拜隆注射嗎啡
It』s not me.
Barlow could use some morphine.

1258
01:38:25,692 --> 01:38:27,776
有人去照顧他了
讓我來看看你的傷
They've got him.
Let's see about you first.

1259
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,543
你們找到黃金了嗎？
沒有，不過救了很多人
-Did you get the gold?
- No, but we helped a lot of people.

1260
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:47,504
現在我們要想辦法
送他們過邊境
Right now we have to get them
over the border.

1261
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:52,329
若是沒人保護，他們必死無疑
你會被逮捕的
-They'll be killed without our protection.
-They're gonna bust you for that.

1262
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,511
你只管報導這件事
咱們靜觀其變
Then cover it and see what happens.

1263
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,941
Hey.

1264
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:09,535
你真的不跟我們一塊兒走？
-You sure you're not coming with us?
-No.

1265
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:13,769
不，我要留下繼續作戰
I will stay here to fight Saddam.

1266
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:16,366
祝你好運
Good luck.

1267
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:25,208
坐好，我們很快就要出發了
Sit down. We're gonna pull out fast, okay?

1268
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,210
坐好，我們就要出發了
Everybody sit down. We're pulling off.

1269
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,825
華特，你認識他們嗎？
-Walter, did you meet everybody?
-Walter, this is Kaied.

1270
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:32,841
華特，這是卡伊德
Hi, Kaied.

1271
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,914
你打算怎麼做？
What are you thinking?

1272
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,713
我們護送他們通過伊拉克關卡
確定他們平安無事後再回來
We walk them past
the Iraqi soldiers. Make sure they're safe.

1273
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:55,465
We walk back to the trucks
and we get out of here.

1274
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:58,051
開始吧
All right, let's do it!

1275
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:05,392
不准帶槍，只有美軍才能拿槍
No guns. Only American soldiers
carry guns.

1276
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:12,983
We are just now about....

1277
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:15,436
拍到了嗎？
We're getting it now? We're about
25 yards from an Iraqi checkpoint...

1278
01:41:15,441 --> 01:41:20,440
我們目前在位於伊拉克關卡
25碼處，對面就是伊朗
...heading into Iran.

1279
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:24,953
我們即將要越過邊境進入伊朗
We are just about to move across
the zone up into the Iranian border.

1280
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,289
這裡到處都是鐵絲網
一行人有男女老幼
It』s a barbed-wire point.

1281
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:30,917
We have men, women and children here...

1282
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:34,963
這群伊拉克難民
就要進入伊朗了
...assumed to be Iraqi refugees
crossing over into Iran.

1283
01:41:35,214 --> 01:41:38,300
叫他們好好照顧康拉德
我會的
-Make sure they take care of Conrad.
-I will.

1284
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:42,053
現場有許多伊拉克士兵
--ally of the United States
would be not an ally of the United States.

1285
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:46,016
We did see a lot of Iraqi soldiers.
They are here, up in bunkers.

1286
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,976
大家不要走散了
Keep in a tight group.

1287
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:52,689
這似乎是某種檢查站
They're going through
some kind of checkpoint.

1288
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,525
這已經違反了美國的政策
This is a violation of American policy.

1289
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:59,237
美國已經取消了對難民的援助
The United States has
withdrawn its support.

1290
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,160
停機再拍
-Okay. Let's cut and go again.
- Okay.

1291
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:11,166
Officially supported by
the United States, they are refugees now...

1292
01:42:11,334 --> 01:42:13,376
...um, trying to escape
from Saddam Hussein--

1293
01:42:16,714 --> 01:42:21,384
The refugees are 150 yards
from the border of Iran.

1294
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:26,890
Uh, the Americans here are not supposed
to be escorting anyone across the border....

1295
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:33,647
你們不假外出
並違反了美國政策
You are AWOL, and you
are in violation of American policy.

1296
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,065
你們已經被逮捕了
You are under arrest.

1297
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:37,400
動作快
Double-time. Let's go!

1298
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:39,736
我們能在他們
阻止我們之前過去的
We can make it before they stop us.

1299
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:44,741
--to make it across the border
before the Americans land and stop them.

1300
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:48,078
Come on. Move, move!

1301
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:53,917
快逮捕他們
帶他們離開難民營
Arrest them. Get them away
from those refugees.

1302
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:56,336
快跑
Let's go!

1303
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:00,590
快來
Come here. Come here.

1304
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:02,926
把手給我，小心
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. Come on.

1305
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:04,594
-Come on.
- Watch out! Unh!

1306
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:09,049
你被逮捕了
讓我帶這些人過去
You're under arrest!
-Let me just help these people get across!

1307
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:12,849
不

1308
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:15,188
讓我帶她過去
Let me get her over! Ah!

1309
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:16,915
讓我帶她過去
-Let me get her over!
-Wait! Wait!

1310
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:20,989
等等，讓他們過去
Just let them get over first! Wait!

1311
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:23,989
我要能伸手轉動氣門才行
I need to reach this valve in my chest.

1312
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:27,284
你們快讓他們過去
Look what's happening!
Just let them get over!

1313
01:43:27,577 --> 01:43:30,370
求求你們讓他們過去
你們不能幫助他們
Help these people get across
and I'll go with you!

1314
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:33,039
讓我帶他們過去
我就跟你們回去
Let me get them across,
and I'll go right with you.

1315
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,501
跟我們來
Let's go. You're coming with me!
-Wait. Wait.

1316
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:41,840
我們不幫他們的話
他們會被殺的
They'll get slaughtered
if we don't help them across!

1317
01:43:42,133 --> 01:43:44,384
你們為何這麼做？
他們會被殺的
Why you doing this, man?
They gonna kill them!

1318
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,055
難民沒有辦法成功越過邊境
他們被…
The refugees are not crossing
the border. They have been rounded up....

1319
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:55,020
讓他們過去
- Just let them get over!
- Not our mission!

1320
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,479
這不是我們的任務
你不屬於這裡
You don't belong here!

1321
01:43:56,689 --> 01:43:58,773
你是怎麼回事？
你不該這麼想的
What is the matter?
You ought to know better!

1322
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:01,776
這不是我們的問題，你懂嗎？
We're not involved in this problem,
Major Gates. Understand?

1323
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:03,904
你不假外出，你被逮捕了
You're AWOL, and you're under arrest!

1324
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:07,657
你要讓他們殺這些人嗎？
這是不對的
Are you gonna let them
kill those people? It』s not right, Ron.

1325
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:15,661
他們被逮捕了
我不能呼吸了
-They're arresting them.
- I can't breathe!

1326
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,668
你敢耍我，你現在完了
你給我閉嘴
Hey! You fucked me, now you're fucked!
So shut your mouth!

1327
01:44:18,836 --> 01:44:21,004
--of American policy, major.
Do you understand?

1328
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:24,007
我要放氣
快點照顧他
-I need to reach this!
-Give this man medical attention.

1329
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:26,426
我不知道你在搞什麼鬼
但這不是我們的問題
We're not involved in this problem here.

1330
01:44:26,636 --> 01:44:30,092
少校，你太過份了
你們看他
-You're way out of line, major.
- Look at him!

1331
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,682
我沒辦法放氣
他無法呼吸
- I can't reach the valve!
- He can't breathe!

1332
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:35,518
把他的手銬在前面
-Put the cuffs in the front!
- He'll die if you don't--

1333
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,896
他會死的…
你們先為自己著想吧
You don't worry about him!
Worry about yourself!

1334
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:40,023
Damn it, Ron, cut his cuffs!

1335
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:43,360
你已經被逮捕了
He can't breathe! Cut his cuffs!

1336
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,570
這是怎麼回事？把攝影機關掉
What the hell is this?
Turn that camera off!

1337
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,657
這個攝影機很貴耶
你在這裡做什麼？
- Hey, that's a $70,000 camera!
- What are you people doing here?

1338
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:51,493
我有得到授權…
-I was authorized to be here.
- You were not authorized.

1339
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:53,328
他要死了
He's gonna die!

1340
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:56,915
- Why aren't you helping them?
- Because it's not our policy!

1341
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:58,166
快解開他的手銬
Cut his cuffs!

1342
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:00,335
我有權報導這則新聞
我取消你的授權
-I should tell this story!
-Out of the pool!

1343
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:01,586
狗屎
你滾吧
-Bullshit!
-You're done!

1344
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:27,362
我們只想幫他們而已
他們離邊境不到一百尺
All we had to do was help them.
It was less than 100 feet.

1345
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:52,345
我們找到黃金了
We got the gold.

1346
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:54,389
什麼？
What?

1347
01:45:54,849 --> 01:45:58,018
我們找到科威特的金條
鬼扯
-The Kuwaiti bullion. We've got it.
- Bullshit.

1348
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:04,720
你看那個袋子，把袋子給我
去拿袋子
-Hold that bag. Give me that bag!
-Get the bag.

1349
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,873
你們拿到多少？
2300萬
-How much do you have?
-Twenty-three million.

1350
01:46:20,041 --> 01:46:21,124
在哪裡？
-Where's it at?
- No.

1351
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,001
不行，先讓他們過去
Get those people over first.

1352
01:46:23,169 --> 01:46:25,336
是他們幫我們找到的
They helped us find it, Ron.

1353
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:31,169
我們跟他們說好了
We made a deal. It』s a soldier's honor.
事關軍人的榮譽
不能言而無信
You can't fuck them now.

1354
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:34,929
把黃金還給科威特
解救難民，你會升將軍的
Come on. Return the gold.

1355
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:39,768
Save some refugees. Get that star.

1356
01:46:42,813 --> 01:46:44,689
走吧，道格
Let's go, Doug.

1357
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:56,159
這裡是誰作主？
Who's in charge here?

1358
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:25,188
你們被捕了
將會受到軍法審判
You're under arrest.
You'll be court-martialed...

1359
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:27,899
而且還要帶我們去找黃金
...and you'll show us
where that bullion is right now.

1360
01:48:25,029 --> 01:48:30,299
「艾奇，特洛
和契夫光榮退伍」

1361
01:48:30,699 --> 01:48:36,999
「這一切都歸功於
愛德安娜的報導」

1362
01:48:40,609 --> 01:48:46,679
「契夫辭掉了機場的工作
轉而和艾奇共事」

1363
01:48:49,559 --> 01:48:55,319
「艾奇成為好萊塢的軍事顧問」

1364
01:49:01,899 --> 01:49:08,069
「拜隆在加州經營地毯生意」

1365
01:49:09,639 --> 01:49:13,079
「伊拉克將黃金還給科威特」

1366
01:49:13,079 --> 01:49:19,389
「但宣稱其中部份不知去向」
