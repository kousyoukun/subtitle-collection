1
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,081
Are we shooting?

2
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,516
What?

3
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,085
Are we shooting people or what?

4
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,587
Are we shooting?

5
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,856
That's what I'm asking you!

6
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:15,848
What's the answer?

7
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:22,054
Give me some gum.\nI already gave you some.

8
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:29,461
I think this guy has a weapon!

9
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,968
Yeah, he does!

10
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,685
Congratulations, my man,\nyou shot yourself a raghead!

11
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,856
Dag. Didn't think I'd get to see\nanybody shot in this war.

12
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,627
Take my picture.

13
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,007
Spirits are high\nand the music is boisterous...

14
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,999
...as these young troops\nShit, hold on a second.

15
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,303
Music is high and spirits are soaring\nas these   Did I just say ''soaring''?

16
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:47,116
How did it sound?

17
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:50,108
They say you exorcised the ghost of\nVietnam with a clear moral imperative.

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,112
We liberated Kuwait.

19
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:57,349
<i>And I had to start again</i>\n<i>With just my children and my wife</i>

20
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,753
<i>I would thank my lucky stars</i>\n<i>To be living here today</i>

21
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,269
<i>Because the flag</i>\n<i>Still stands for freedom</i>

22
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,261
<i>And they can't take that away</i>

23
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,631
<i>And I gladly stand up next to you</i>

24
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,845
<i>And defend her still today</i>

25
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:18,837
<i>'Cause there ain't no doubt</i>\n<i>I love this land</i>

26
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:24,476
<i>God bless the U.S.A.</i>

27
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:11,234
Trained warrior! Trained warrior!

28
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,226
Trained warrior! Oh, my God!\nMajor Gates!

29
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,886
What's Adriana got?

30
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,521
Just the celebration story.

31
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,513
That's it? That story's evaporating.

32
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:37,549
The lraqi POW story's evaporating.

33
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:41,219
Still have my gold story, though.\nReturning the gold to Kuwait.

34
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,690
What do you know about that?

35
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,375
What's going on?\nI was about to ask you the same.

36
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,367
You said he was former Delta, he'd take\ncare of me. What a bunch of bullshit!

37
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,705
Let me handle this!\nDoesn't she have an escort?

38
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:02,941
She's right here.\nFind her someone to fuck...

39
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,755
...so she'll leave my escort alone.\nThat's unnecessary.

40
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,747
I don't want him going to other\nreporters and giving away my stories.

41
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:12,562
You don't have any stories.\nYou don't tell people that!

42
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,554
Look at what's become of you!

43
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,931
I really don't need this shit, major.\nYou understand me?

44
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,668
This is a media war!\nAnd you better get onboard!

45
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,405
We'll talk tomorrow,\nand I'll straight you out!

46
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:35,318
Take a picture!

47
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,310
One more!

48
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,282
Very handsome.

49
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,500
Good shot, Barlow!

50
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,492
Enough!

51
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,667
Captain's coming!

52
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,776
You better move your butts.\nHe's coming right now!

53
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,879
Goddamn it! Where the hell did this\nbooze come from? Get rid of it!

54
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,183
We gotta take more\nlraqi prisoners tomorrow! Tomorrow!

55
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,798
Remove the magazine from your weapon.

56
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,790
Sling your weapon over your left\nshoulder, muzzle down.

57
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,904
Have both arms raised above your head.

58
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,896
Approach the multinational forces\nposition slowly...

59
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,310
...with the lead soldier\nholding this document...

60
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,302
...above his head. If you do this,\nyou will not die.

61
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,041
You will be processed\nas prisoners of war...

62
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,111
...provided food, shelter and clothing.

63
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,328
Do not resist.

64
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,897
If you do this, you get this.

65
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,889
If you surrender,\nyou will get food and shelter. Okay?

66
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:02,060
Everything's cool. nobody's gonna\nhurt you. Just relax.

67
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,074
Sir, you'll have to\ntake the turban off as well.

68
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,710
Did you rape and torture anyone\nin Kuwait?

69
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,712
What about you, motherfucker?!

70
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,704
You're making them hysterical.\nStop that. You'll get us in trouble.

71
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,751
Relax. We want everybody facedown.

72
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,919
Come on.

73
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,287
Get down.

74
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,279
Take these things off.\n<i>no comprende</i> English?

75
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,865
I want to be professional.\nHe won't take his rags off.

76
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,857
Pay attention to how it's done.\nExcuse me, sir.

77
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,961
We'll need you to disrobe like all\nthe other towelheads.

78
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,945
I hate to see it come to this.\nStrip him down.

79
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,948
Come on, motherfucker.

80
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,940
Take your fucking clothes off.

81
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,392
Troy, come here! Check this out.

82
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,262
Freaky thing here, possibly!

83
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:01,130
There's a document in that guy's ass.

84
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,466
We got a classified situation.

85
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,067
You think he ate it?

86
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,059
It wouldn't come out\nperfect like that.

87
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:11,307
Pull it out.

88
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,299
Man, I didn't join the Army to pull\npaper out of people's asses.

89
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,403
no, sir. not what I signed up for.

90
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,424
Open it up.

91
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,416
You only gave me one glove.

92
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:35,554
That's how the chain of command works.

93
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,007
What is it?

94
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,999
It's important enough\nto squeeze your cheeks for.

95
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:52,504
You're supposed to make her feel good\nabout the stories we want.

96
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,042
You don't walk away from her\nand go screw another journalist!

97
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,655
I never wanted this job, Ron.

98
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,191
Your work in lraq was over. Done!

99
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:05,183
I'm trying to help you.\nIf you play your cards right...

100
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:08,030
...she may hook you up with\nthe media at home.

101
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,022
Fuck that.

102
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,236
You got your star clinched.

103
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:16,228
So it's my fault that you\nplateaued a long time ago.

104
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:19,108
I don't even know what we did here.

105
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:21,477
Just tell me what we did here, Ron.

106
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,046
You want to occupy lraq\nand do Vietnam again?

107
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:26,082
Is that your brilliant idea?

108
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,074
I'm retiring anyway.\nUntil you do, you're an Army officer.

109
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:56,212
You've washed your hands\na thousand times.

110
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,714
Lord knows what vermin\nlive in the butt of a dune coon.

111
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:01,517
Why do you let this cracker\nfollow you around?

112
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,509
He's from a group home in Dallas.\nHe doesn't know better.

113
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,057
I don't care if he's from\nJohannesburg.

114
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:11,049
I don't want to hear ''dune coon'' or\n''sand nigger'' from him or anybody.

115
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,163
Captain uses those terms.

116
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:17,155
The point is, ''towelhead'' and ''camel\njockey'' are good substitutes.

117
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,835
Exactly.\nI apologize.

118
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,827
It's confusing with all this pro Saudi,\nanti lraqi type language and all that.

119
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,832
Did you get the aerials?

120
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,545
How'd you get those?

121
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,181
Chief is hooked up.\nKeep Walter on that door.

122
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,350
Would you take those fucking things off?

123
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,218
I never got to use night vision.

124
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,287
They do not work during the day!

125
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:39,955
They kind of work.

126
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,947
Just stand outside so Chief can\ntranslate my lraqi ass map, okay?

127
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,522
Are you ready to work with me now?

128
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,269
I'm ready to work with you.

129
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,805
Good. Because I've got\nan amazing lead.

130
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,274
It was in his ass.\nThat's not the real story.

131
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,810
What's the real story?\nIt was in the guy's dick.

132
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,445
Pulled it out with tweezers.

133
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:05,114
A 1 0 page atlas of Saddam's bunkers?

134
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:08,106
Only real small, like those books you\nget in a box of Cracker Jacks.

135
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,122
They pull it out the guy ear.

136
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:14,724
What?\n''Out of his ear.''

137
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,025
Maybe out the nose.

138
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,626
What's he saying?\n''The nose.''

139
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,795
Tell me what body part.\nLet me handle this.

140
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,198
It was stitched in back of his head.

141
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:23,799
The back of his head.

142
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,301
Who is the guy?\nWhat guy?

143
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,736
The guy who found it!

144
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,371
I cannot tell you.\nFuck that!

145
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,139
You said you could.\nnot now.

146
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,075
This guy doesn't know shit.

147
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,310
He doesn't know shit.

148
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,302
Listen to me. This guy is French\nSpecial Forces, and he can help us.

149
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,216
He can?\nYes, and he's my friend.

150
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,718
But he won't talk to me\nif you're around.

151
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,720
You better not be fucking with me.

152
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,712
I want the story this time.\nYou'll get the story.

153
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,150
These have to be Saddam's bunkers\nbetween Karbala and nazaria.

154
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,763
What's inside?

155
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:56,755
According to Intel, Picasso, Sony,\nArmani, Rolex....

156
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,991
Kuwait was the Arab Beverly Hills,\nand Saddam jacked them for it.

157
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:05,597
One Rolex would get me a very nice\nhouse outside of Garland.

158
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,377
Five would get\na Lexus convertible.

159
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,546
Lexus doesn't make one.\nYes, they do.

160
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,348
It has room for a kid seat.

161
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,340
Infiniti has a convertible, not Lexus.\nWrong.

162
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,813
He could also put a land mine\nin our path.

163
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,228
What are you talking about?

164
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:29,220
I have a ring of Jesus fire\nto guide my decisions.

165
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,900
You're putting me on, right?

166
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,802
Do I look like I'm putting you on?

167
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,637
Okay, ring of Jesus fire.

168
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,138
Halt!

169
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,641
Freeze, motherfucker!

170
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,209
Sir, this tent is restricted.

171
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,112
Get out of my way.

172
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:46,104
Mayday! Mayday! Goddamn it!

173
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:51,954
Good afternoon.

174
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,123
Would this be the proctology tent?

175
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,459
no, sir.

176
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,451
Maybe it's a urology tent.

177
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,523
Or the ear, nose and throat tent.

178
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,904
Captain a proctologist?

179
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,773
What's a proctologist, sir?

180
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:13,375
Doesn't matter.

181
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,367
I'm not looking for him.\nI'm looking for Barlow.

182
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,878
You're on the path to truth when you\nsmell shit. Isn't that what they say?

183
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,061
I don't recognize you, sir.\nAre you in this division?

184
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,053
He's not from this division.\nHe's Special Forces.

185
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,800
Did you present this map\nto your captain?

186
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,803
not yet, sir.

187
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,271
I'll take it to him.

188
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,263
That's not necessary, sir.\nI can take it to him.

189
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,209
Don't get grabby, sergeant.

190
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,201
He's our C.O.\nI'd have to tell him you took it.

191
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,406
That won't do either of us any good,\nwill it?

192
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,711
no, sir.

193
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:04,883
Sit down.

194
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:10,199
What do you see here?\nBunkers, sir.

195
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,968
What's in them?\nStuff they stole from Kuwait.

196
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,960
Bullshit. I'm talking about millions\nin Kuwaiti bullions.

197
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,797
The little cubes you put in\nhot water and make soup?

198
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:23,234
no, not the little cubes you put in hot\nwater to make soup.

199
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:24,947
Gold bricks.

200
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,939
Saddam stole it from the sheiks. I have\nno problem stealing it from Saddam.

201
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:32,143
My guess is, he's divided these bricks\ninto several different stashes.

202
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,713
Just one stash would be easy for us to\ntake from his deserting army.

203
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,029
That'd be enough to get us\nout of our day jobs.

204
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,021
Unless you reservists are\nin love with your day jobs.

205
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,371
I don't really have a day job, sir.

206
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:02,484
First thing we have to do is...

207
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,476
...make sure this is more than\na love letter to an lraqi.

208
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:08,257
It's a series of bunkers\noutside Karbala, sir.

209
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,593
Maybe.\nDefinitely, sir.

210
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,661
The recon photos match.

211
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,396
We'll see.

212
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,398
Dag!

213
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,390
It's what makes SF so badass.\nWe got the best flashlights.

214
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,937
Still looks like a series of bunkers.

215
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,929
Three villages a little farther\nto the east.

216
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,843
Seventy five clicks north.\nMore like 65.

217
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,712
Way north of any allied troops.

218
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:32,414
Perfect. We don't want\nany troops around.

219
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:35,384
Just us and a Humvee\nup by the Euphrates River Valley.

220
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,353
Where they put Moses in the basket.

221
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,345
That's Egypt.

222
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,781
<i>We three kings be stealing the gold</i>

223
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,851
Quiet down!

224
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,597
Will you shut up?

225
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,866
Are you done singing?

226
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,067
What about mines, sir?

227
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:55,037
Grid was swept by the 82nd.\nWe'll stick to the roads.

228
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,072
Will we need a deuce and a half?

229
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,064
It's easier in a Humvee.\nWhat if we have a lot to carry?

230
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,646
We'll grab an lraqi truck.\nIt's better cover.

231
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,382
We could say we captured it.\nThat's right.

232
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,374
We leave at dawn, back before lunch.\nno big deal.

233
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,922
Bolo! Get in here!

234
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,759
Who's Bolo?\nA guy who doesn't know what he's doing.

235
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,227
Yes, sir.

236
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,219
Get this reporter off my back.\nYou know who Adriana Cruz is?

237
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,666
Reporter on nBS, sir.\nThat's right.

238
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,658
Tell her I'm checking a story,\nand you're bringing her to meet me.

239
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,971
In lraq?\nno.

240
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,573
I'll give you a fake copy of this map.

241
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,876
Take her on a ride\nthat lasts all morning...

242
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,868
...and goes nowhere near the villages\noutside Karbala.

243
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,904
When you don't find me, it'll be because\nyou got lost. Is that clear?

244
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,919
Any other questions?

245
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,822
Is it true that to be SF,\nyou got to cut off an enemy's ear?

246
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,814
Are you able to control him?\nYes, sir. He'll be fine.

247
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:54,218
Let's get ready to roll in the morning.

248
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,826
All right, here we go, ma'am!

249
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,305
Pull!

250
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:18,509
Pull!

251
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,284
Let me get some, Chief!

252
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,435
I gave you a better arc!

253
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:34,603
What do you mean?

254
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,739
I threw the ball at a higher arc.

255
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,731
Bullshit!

256
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:43,101
Stop speaking right now.

257
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:46,582
Houston's gone nowhere with Warren Moon.

258
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:49,418
Randall Cunningham?\nDon't get in the mud with him.

259
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,920
Eagles'll never get to\nSuper Bowl with Cunningham.

260
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,912
Doug Williams not only took the Redskins\nto the Super Bowl, but they won!

261
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,984
We can all agree there are many\nexcellent black quarterbacks.

262
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,654
Let's see what you can hit.

263
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,470
I'll hit an lraqi.\nI'll blow his head off!

264
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,273
If he talks like that, ignore him,\nor it'll get worse.

265
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:14,209
You're right.\nJust can't help myself sometimes.

266
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:17,201
Watch this!

267
00:18:23,418 --> 00:18:26,410
What was that?\nA rigged football C 4, sir.

268
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,223
Why'd you do that?

269
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,160
You said we could fire some rounds\nwhen we left camp.

270
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,729
I said you could fire a few rounds.

271
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,798
We didn't get to see any action.

272
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:38,790
You want to see some action?\nYeah, I do, sir.

273
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:54,739
Is this what you're after?

274
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,543
We dropped a lot of bombs out here.

275
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,315
The only action we seen was on Cnn,\nexcept for that dude Troy shot.

276
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,462
Shot him in the neck?\nThat's right, sir.

277
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:10,465
Fucking badass. I was there.\nTook him out at 400 yards.

278
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,367
Head popped up in the air.

279
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,359
Crazy shot, man!

280
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:17,406
I don't know.\nSpecifically.

281
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,398
The worst thing about a gunshot,\nprovided you survive the bullet...

282
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,411
...is sepsis.

283
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,979
Infection of the blood.

284
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,548
Say a bullet tears into you

285
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,540
Creates a cavity of dead tissue.\nThat cavity...

286
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:32,610
...it fills up with bile and bacteria.\nYou're fucked.

287
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,996
But we're going to do this without\nfiring any shots...

288
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,988
...and just to be sure,\nwe'll do a dry run.

289
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,401
So get your suits on.

290
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:49,393
now, we will say that the cow is a\nprimary guard outside the bunker.

291
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:53,742
Pull up fast, stop short.

292
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:55,777
Move very aggressively. Got it?

293
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,346
Got it!

294
00:19:57,346 --> 00:20:00,338
Let's go!

295
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,070
Who's hurt?

296
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,062
It's all cow.

297
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,366
Yeah, it's all cow.

298
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,914
Y'all see that cow's head shoot up?

299
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,316
Just like a cartoon.\nIt's fucking crazy.

300
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,251
You said this area was swept for mines.

301
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:39,243
Wasn't a mine. It was a cluster bomb.\nThey're hard to see.

302
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,891
Get in the Humvee.\nWe're moving on.

303
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:45,394
<i>Round, round, get around</i>\n<i>I get around</i>

304
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:48,386
<i>Yeah, get around</i>\n<i>I get around</i>

305
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,844
We go in fast, leave the safeties on.

306
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,836
Hit them with the blinding power\nof American sunshine.

307
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,904
Where's the bunker?

308
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,896
There. no, there!

309
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,704
Orders from the President\nof the United States of America!

310
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,307
Orders from the President\nof the United States of America!

311
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,821
Stay back!

312
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,423
On the ground, right now!

313
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:51,415
We are the Army\nof the United States of America!

314
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,819
Stay back!

315
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:59,824
no milk! Baby milk!

316
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,937
Baby milk!

317
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,929
Let's go!

318
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,946
Let's go! Step aside! Move!

319
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,938
Orders from President Bush!\nPart of the cease fire agreement.

320
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,413
Clear. Let's move!

321
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,617
United States military!

322
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,588
We are here for your protection\nand safety, all right?

323
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,626
Get down on the ground!\nGet down on the ground!

324
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:49,540

00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:59,650
Shit!

326
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,990

327
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:09,037
Freeze!\nI love the United State of freedom.

328
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:11,339
I am hate Saddam.

329
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:14,331
Let him go!

330
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:18,046

331
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:19,347
no problem.

332
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,349
Tell him to shut up. Be quiet.

333
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:23,351
I am love United State of freedom.

334
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,754

00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,426
I am friend.

337
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,928
You look for chemical weapon?

338
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,920
We look for the gold.\nno gold here.

339
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,699
no gold.

340
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,501
What did he say?\nno gold, my friend.

341
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,969
He says there's no gold here!

342
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,961
Where's the gold?

343
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,208
Kill him.\nYou want to die?!

344
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,777
Other bunker, other village!\nOther bunker?

345
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,769
not this bunker?\nno. not this town.

346
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:55,573
That town! Yes! That town.

347
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,678
Let's go.

348
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:10,181
It's milk.

349
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:23,027
Please bring medicine!

350
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,107
Please help us.

351
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,176
Come on!

352
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,945
Off the vehicle!

353
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,581
Ma'am, you'll have to step down\nfrom the vehicle!

354
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:35,573
Hospital!

355
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,153
Food. Food.

356
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:41,145
Give them the M.R.E.s! Let's go!

357
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:46,584
Take that. Take that.

358
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,764
He's taking the water\naway from that woman!

359
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:52,500
Heads up!

360
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,703
Here you go.

361
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:57,695
Look out! Get off!

362
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:09,206
Take me, take me!

363
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,876
You can't come with us!

364
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,995
Right here, right now.

365
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,502
Civilians spitting on soldiers,\nsoldiers shooting civilians.

366
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,749
They ignored us like we weren't there.

367
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,218
They surrendered to us.\nThey're after civilians now.

368
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:45,086
Why'd they blow up that milk truck?

369
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,023
Trying to starve the people out.

370
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,026
Bush told the people to rise up\nagainst Saddam.

371
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,161
They thought they had our support.

372
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,153
now they're getting slaughtered.

373
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,738
So where's the next bunker?

374
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:06,730
About 20 clicks on the map,\naccording to what that guy said.

375
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:11,001
no, it's not.

376
00:27:11,613 --> 00:27:13,448
There's something about that well.

377
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:16,284
What well?\nThe well in the center of town.

378
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:19,276
There were soldiers guarding it.\nI bet there's a bunker in there.

379
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:22,490
Guy lied to us.

380
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,482
It's back where we came from.

381
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,790
I don't know if I can do this, okay?

382
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,936
I got a family.

383
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,928
If I'm gonna shit in a bag for life\n'cause I got shot after the war...

384
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,076
...that'd be pretty stupid,\nwouldn't it?

385
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,712
What's the most important thing in life?

386
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:46,648
What are you talking about?

387
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,650
What's the most important thing?

388
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:51,086
Respect.\nToo dependent on other people.

389
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,078
What, love?\nA little Disneyland, isn't it?

390
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,623
God's will.

391
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,125
Close.

392
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,493
What is it, then?

393
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:00,228
necessity.

394
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,396
As in...?

395
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:04,388
People do what is most necessary\nto them at any given moment.

396
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,574
We can do what we want.\nThey won't touch us.

397
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:15,566
All right. I'll be wearing\nfashionable Kevlar.

398
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:19,080
Me too.

399
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,072
Come on, Conrad.

400
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,919
Where the hell are the bunkers?

401
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,422
Supposed to be right around here.

402
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,414
How about these fires?

403
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:35,363
How about a rare pelican migration\nout by the marshes?

404
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:38,099
Fuck that! Stop the car!

405
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,001
I don't see any bunkers. Do you?

406
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,804
We'll find Major Gates, ma'am.

407
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,673
Bullshit. All we're finding is\nUkrainian cranes.

408
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:47,275
Pelicans.

409
00:28:47,275 --> 00:28:50,267
This story has been so done.\nA waste of my fucking time.

410
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,848
Look at these poor fucking birds.

411
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,840
All covered in some kind of fucking oil,\necological catastrophic....

412
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,012
Fuck it!

413
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:06,283
It's so goddamn horrible!

414
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,122
Jesus Christ!

415
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:19,307
Poor fucking birds!

416
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,509
Look at them.

417
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,501
It's so sad.

418
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,649
You're not gonna fuck me.

419
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,641
I was promised the gold story,\nand I'm driving.

420
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,655
Military regulations. You cannot drive!

421
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:35,824
Step away from the Chenowth, ma'am!

422
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:38,816
Don't make me shoot you, ma'am!

423
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:49,493
Please fucking stop!

424
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,283
Will you tell me where he is?

425
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,619
I can't tell you!\nBullshit!

426
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,621
Where is he?\nI can't  !

427
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,613
Come on, bitch! Tell me where he is!

428
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,360
You'll die here\nlike these fucking birds!

429
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,352
It's a village near Karbala!

430
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:20,624
All right! Let's go to Karbala.

431
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,346
Get down!

432
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:34,338
Get down!

433
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:12,409
Freeze!

434
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,747
...the United States military\nhereby confiscates...

435
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:19,816
...all materials stolen by lraq\nfrom the state of Kuwait.

436
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,730
That means everything you took\nis going back!

437
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,733
Stay calm and\nwe'll get through this quickly.

438
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:28,725
Is that clear? Good!

439
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,795
Grab him!

440
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,946
Keep your finger off the trigger!

441
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,113
Sorry about that, sir.

442
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:40,181
no.

443
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,784
For wife!

444
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,452
I'm divorced.

445
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:47,444
newest and best.

446
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:50,948
newest and best has better\nnoise reduction.

447
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:57,054
This is bad music. This is bad for you.

448
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,624
I want you to tell me where the gold is.

449
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,827
There's another door over here.

450
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,738
He is prisoner. It's okay.

451
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,765
These rebel lraq problem!

452
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:33,757
We take outside\nso they don't bother you.

453
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,711
You open that door now.

454
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,703
Open that door!

455
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,108
Let's go!

456
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:02,630
Get down on the ground!

457
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,732
The prisoner stay!

458
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,067
Get on the ground!

459
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,059
The prisoners must stay!

460
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:19,429
Listen to me. Everything you stole from\nKuwait belongs to us now. Understand?

461
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,513
Put it back.

462
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:26,547
Why?

463
00:34:26,547 --> 00:34:29,539
We stick to the plan for the gold.\nWe're not thieves.

464
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:32,843
We're returning Kuwaiti bullion,\ncorrect?

465
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:11,392
Full.

466
00:35:11,392 --> 00:35:14,384
Full.

467
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,907
I'm getting a fleet of Lexus\nconvertibles.

468
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:28,576
I told you Lexus don't make\na convertible.

469
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:31,568
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

470
00:35:36,317 --> 00:35:37,451
You all right?

471
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,187
It landed on my foot.

472
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,923
They definitely didn't\nget here in these bags.

473
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,625
The tensilary strength in these\nis only 200 pounds.

474
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,494
What?\nTensilary strength.

475
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:49,486
He works at an airport.

476
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,500
If we put it in one of these\nVuitton bags...

477
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,369
...they can hold about 65 pounds,\nmaybe more.

478
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,361
You have any more luggage?

479
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,594
United States military\nis in charge here.

480
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,681
What gas station?

481
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:43,673
The one upstairs.

482
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:52,026
We need a truck.

483
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,262
Did we get it?

484
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:55,463
Did we get it?

485
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,598
We got it.\nIs it a lot?

486
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:00,590
You have no idea. Are you cool here?

487
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,637
They've been ignoring me.

488
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,629
Don't worry about it. Stay calm.\nI'm going to find a truck.

489
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,210
Move!

490
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,146
Move away from the vehicle!

491
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,138
Let's go!

492
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,088
You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?

493
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:56,290
We take the Kuwaiti gold, yes.

494
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,282
Saddam cannot keep?\nno, Saddam cannot keep.

495
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,262
Saddam have many problem today.

496
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:02,863
He certainly does.

497
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,855
You need help to carry?

498
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,025
I think we'll be all right.

499
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:14,608
These man help you.

500
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,077
These man help you.

501
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:19,069
And then you go away fast\nfrom all this bullshit.

502
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,344
Keep it going, keep it going.

503
00:38:48,843 --> 00:38:51,835
Don't leave. Please don't leave.

504
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:01,277
Look!

505
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,457

506
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:04,792
Look!

507
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:05,960
Look!

509
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:11,154
Please!

510
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,759
Don't go. Don't go.

511
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,770
You go now, please.

512
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,138
I don't think so.

513
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,140
This man is leader of uprising.

514
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,132
Let's just stick to the plan!\nThe plan is for the gold!

515
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,402
We can help these people,\nthen we'll be on our way.

516
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:02,505
That's not why we're here!\nLet's go!

517
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,915
Cover me.

518
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,995
no unnecessary shots, Conrad,\nbecause we know what they do.

519
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:29,210
They make infected pockets\nfull of bile, sir.

520
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,202
That's right. That's what they do.

521
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,526
I want you to leave this town.

522
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,518
Saddam kill us if we leave.\nKill our family!

523
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:30,838
no shooting.

524
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:33,741
Okay, we work something out.

525
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,733
Easy! Take it easy!

526
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,983
What's happening?

527
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,975
Accident. Stay cool.

528
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,127
Put your hands up.

529
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,327
I'm okay.

530
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,319
Get down!

531
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,837
Shut up! Get down!

532
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,829
Get down! Shut up.

533
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:22,605
Put the people in the Humvee.\nWhat?!

534
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:26,620
There's no room!\nMake room!

535
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,522
What happened to necessity?

536
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,190
It just changed!

537
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,359
not for me! Let's go!

538
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,460
What if that was you?!

539
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,452
What if this was you without Kevlar?!

540
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:43,771
Great. A fucking tank!

541
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:46,763
That should send us on our way!

542
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,867
L.A.W., sir?

543
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:52,813
Let's get the hell out of here.

544
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:55,805
It's about fucking time!

545
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,520
Ride in that Humvee. Let's go!\nIn the Humvee!

546
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,512
Come on, sweetheart, come on.

547
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:12,689
Let's go!

548
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,755
Stupid son of a bitch!\nWe were home free!

549
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,747
Give me that arm.

550
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:43,720
What's that tank doing?

551
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:47,490
I don't know. Looks like it stopped.

552
00:44:51,638 --> 00:44:54,630
They broke the cease fire.

553
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,304
It's gas!

554
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,622
Where's my mask?

555
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,259
Where's my fucking mask?

556
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,664
Where's my mask?!

557
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,852
Stop! Stop!

558
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,222
Wait! Those are mines!

559
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:39,195
Come back this way.

560
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:43,466
Stop!

561
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,634
no, this isn't sarin.\nWe'd be dead already!

562
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,070
What is it? Mustard?\nC.S.

563
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:12,472
Tear gas?

564
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:15,464
Times 10.

565
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:20,247
Come here.

566
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,416
Put this on.

567
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,385
Here, you take it.

568
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,521
See that? That's a mine!

569
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:29,890
Don't step there! Do not step there!

570
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,882
Where's your kids?

571
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,930
Cover your face. Come here.

572
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,922
Where are your children?

573
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:47,708
Watch your back!

574
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:48,909
Freeze! Don't move!

575
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:51,901
What's going on?\nI don't know.

576
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:59,408
It's okay. They're helping us.\nThey're with the rebels.

577
00:49:00,587 --> 00:49:03,523
They got a shelter.

578
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,515
Tunnel.

579
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:11,431
Go, go. Get in!

580
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:13,700
I gotta look for Barlow.

581
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,302
Where's Troy?

582
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:18,294
Wait a minute! Where's Troy?

583
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:21,074
We gotta get out of here.

584
00:49:21,074 --> 00:49:22,242
Where is Troy?

585
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:25,212
Come on!\nGet off me!

586
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,204
Let's go!

587

You motherfucker! Get the fuck off me!

588
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:34,637
Get the fuck off me!

589
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,984
We have to go back and get Troy.

590
00:50:37,984 --> 00:50:40,420
He's not out there.\nWe have to wait till it clears.

591
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,090
You made a choice in the village,\nand we lost Troy.

592
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,258
I had no choice.\nYou had a choice!

593
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:48,250
I had no choice.

594
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,854
What about Troy?\nWhat choice does he have now?

595
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:48,488
Paco, start shooting!

596
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:50,190
I don't like this.

597
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,325
We should go!

598
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:55,317
Let me handle this.

599
00:52:09,009 --> 00:52:10,911
Get dressed!

600
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:13,903
Get dressed!

601
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:39,595
Fuck!

Do you speak English?

603
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:51,484
Could you...?

604
00:52:51,484 --> 00:52:53,019
I have a little problem.

605
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,589
<i>I need to know the number.</i>\n<i>What number, please?</i>

606
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,424
Operation Desert Storm.

607
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,359
I'm sorry. l need to know the number.

608
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,928
The big army in the desert.\nIt's an emergency!

609
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,997
You'll have to give me more

610
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:06,989
Fuck! Maybe

611
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,427
Come on, come on, come on!

612
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,520
Honey, it's me.

613

Oh, my God! Baby, I was\nhoping it was you!

614
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:32,425
It's me, honey.

615
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,494
God, the baby's crying.

616
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:35,662
How's she doing?

617
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:38,654
She hasn't slept good, and Mom had\nto go back to work, so I'm real tired.

618
00:53:40,267 --> 00:53:43,259
l wish I was there to help, gooney bird.\n<i>-When are you coming home?</i>

619
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:46,473
I'm working on that right now.

620
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,465
I saw an ad for a computer job.\nYou want me to set up an interview?

621
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:52,245
Listen, honey\nWhat date are you coming home?

Listen to me!\nWhat's happening?

00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,289
<i>-What was that?</i>\nThe wall just exploded.

626
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,690
I thought the war was over.

627
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,459
It is and it isn't.\nCould you call the reserve center?

628
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:07,827
What do you want me to do?

223 north, outside Karbala.

631
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,993
Everything's okay?\n<i>-I don't want you to worry.</i>

632
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:21,041
I tried to do something\nfor the family, and....

633
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:23,643
I just want you to know

I love you.\n<i>-What's going on?</i>

00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:27,981
Just tell Krystal.

636
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,973
Tell her I'm rich, and if things\nwork out, she'll be taken care of.

637
00:54:31,818 --> 00:54:33,153
<i>What are you saying?</i>

638

...as these young troops celebrate\nthe liberation of Kuwait.

641
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,374
I'm being held captive by lraqi troops\noutside a bunker near the gritty city

642
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:08,288
Wait. Cut, cut!

643
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:10,590
You said ''gritty city'' again.

644
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:13,582
Who gives a shit?! These people\nare dying, for chrissake!

645
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,029
What about Private Wogoman?

646
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:18,164
Let's lay one down first.

647
00:55:18,164 --> 00:55:19,332
In three, two....

648
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,324
I'm being held captive\nby lraqi troops...

649
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,597
The rebels have gone down the road....

650
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:38,207
The assault, apparently started by the\nrebels from Karbala, came up on

651
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:41,554
Back off!

652
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,856
Sir, that's enough!

653
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:45,058
We have a right to be here!

654
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,494
That's mine.

655
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:49,562
Fuck it.

656
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:52,132
Could l have my pants, please?

657
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:55,124
My pants! On my legs!

658
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:00,629
Out! Get out!

659
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,143
What did you want to be as a little boy?

660
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:06,135
As a boy, I wanted to be either a\nveterinarian or a ClA sharpshooter.

661
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,983
Really? That's very complicated.

662
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,052
Yes, colonel.

663
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:15,044
What the fuck are you doing?\nI'm giving an interview to nRG.

664
00:56:15,422 --> 00:56:18,414
Do you have authorization?\nYes, sir, l do.

665
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,566
no.

666
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:28,468
Who gave you this?\nMajor Gates.

667
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,460
Archie Gates gave you this?\nJesus Christ, Doug!

668
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:35,397
I don't get to do the interview?\nYou don't get to do the interview.

669
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,845
Come with me.

670
00:56:38,845 --> 00:56:41,837
Tell me where he is, or you're going\nback to the hotel in Dhahran.

671
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:45,518
I don't know. I think he's\nhelping Adriana Cruz.

672
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:47,053
Is she here?\nno, sir.

673
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:48,588
So who else is missing?

674
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:50,356
Chief's not here.\nChief's not here?

675
00:56:50,356 --> 00:56:52,892
You don't know where your\nsergeant is?

676
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:55,884
Barlow and Vig are gone too, sir.

677
00:56:58,598 --> 00:56:59,766
What?

678
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:02,758
I don't know what it was, a map or\nsecret list. I saw it happen.

679
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,439
Did they bring it to you?\nno, sir.

680
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:08,775
See, he's working something.

681
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:11,767
Get me maps. Check radio transmissions.\nMaybe we'll get their positions.

682
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,072
Is that guy dead?\nWhere are you gonna put him?

683
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,085
A shrine.

684
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,922
A shrine?\nWhat kind of shrine y'all got?

685
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,890
A shrine near a holy man...

686
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,882
...that gives him comfort\nand access to paradise.

687
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,392
I'm not kidding.\nIt sounds like a good shrine.

688
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:48,107
Man, I'm sorry I hit you.

689
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,210
I was just worried about Troy.

690
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,045
He's my friend.

691
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:54,614
I didn't want nothing to happen to him.

692
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,606
He's gonna take me to Detroit with\nhim, hook me up with a job.

693
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:02,044
Come on, man.

694
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,903
I don't wanna hold no grudges.

695
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:19,606
You got kicked out of that\nring of Jesus fire, huh?

696
00:59:19,606 --> 00:59:22,598
That ain't how it work.

697
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:24,410
How's it work?

698
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,402
I take care of whatever He puts\nin front of me, no questions asked.

699
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:31,017
He put that gold in front of me,\nand l took it.

700
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:33,186
That's how it works.

701
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:35,588
What about now?

702
00:59:35,588 --> 00:59:38,580
I don't know. I gotta see.

703
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,729
How you doing, Conrad?

704
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:45,721
I'm fine.

705
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,336
It was my choice today.

706
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,328
You can try to head back if you want.\nTake your share and bury it.

707
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,165
I'll find Barlow myseIf.

708
00:59:58,278 --> 01:00:00,179
I wanna find Troy.

709
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,171
I'm here. I'm ready.

710
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:11,246
Let's check the suitcases.

711
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:19,666
I count 79.

712
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:22,635
That means we're missing 4 1 bags.

713
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:25,305
That's about 23 million dollars left.

714
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,297
not bad for a disaster, provided we find\nBarlow and not get court martialed.

715
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,546
How is she?

716
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,316
How is your little girl?

717
01:00:36,316 --> 01:00:39,308
She's traumatized. What do you expect?

718
01:00:40,486 --> 01:00:43,478
I went to B school at Bowling Green.

719
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,715
I came back to open a couple\nof hotels near Karbala.

720
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,896
I'm nearly in the black\nwhen this stupid war starts...

721
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,888
...and you guys bomb all my cafes.

722
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,277
Look at these people.

723
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:05,478
Where is America now?

724
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:08,470
Where is the Army now?!

725
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:13,119
You have a radio?

726
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,955
no radio, no water.

727
01:01:15,955 --> 01:01:18,947
Where's Barlow?\nThey got him.

728
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:21,894
Where would they take him?\nOasis bunker.

729
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:24,063
It's full of Saddam's Guard.

730
01:01:24,063 --> 01:01:27,055
Where's that?\nApproximately 17, 18 miles from here.

731
01:01:29,235 --> 01:01:30,803
We'll walk until we find some.

732
01:01:30,803 --> 01:01:33,072
Why don't you call in the Marines?

733
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:35,475
With what? We don't have a radio.

734
01:01:35,475 --> 01:01:38,467
We'll find a vehicle, you drive back,\nget a helicopter, fly in, get your man.

735
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,015
Can't do that.\nWhy not? You have a huge army here.

736
01:01:43,015 --> 01:01:45,151
We shouldn't be involved\nin the uprising.

737
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:48,143
We killed lraqi soldiers,\nbroke the peace accord.

738
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:50,356
You know what I think?

739
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:53,348
We're fighting Saddam and dying,\nand you're stealing gold.

740
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,863
You're wrong.

741
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,965
They have haIf a million men here.

742
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,957
They send four guys\nto pick up all this bullion?

743
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,627
I don't think so.

744
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,131
We need to find our man. How much\ndo you want to take us to him?

745
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,446
Is this still yours to give?

746
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:16,438
The only reason you have these bags\nis we picked them up.

747
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,318
We'll take our share...

748
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,310
...and we will help you\ncarry your share.

749
01:02:23,222 --> 01:02:26,214
And find our man.

750
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:31,564
Amir Abdulah.

751
01:02:31,564 --> 01:02:33,466
Archie Gates.

752
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:36,458
You will take us to the lranian border.

753
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,561
If we don't get to a refugee camp,\nwe're dead. The nearest is in lran.

754
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,575
You don't need us.\nYou can buy your way.

755
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:45,478
Saddam's soldiers\nwon't take Saddam's gold.

756
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:47,980
Our only chance\nis if we are with Americans.

757
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,982
Can't take you to the lranian border.

758
01:02:49,982 --> 01:02:51,451
Then we don't have a deal.

759
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:53,219
Give me a fucking break, man!

760
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:54,320
We saved your life!

761
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,312
And we saved yours.\nWe lost a man for you.

762
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,151
The big army of democracy beats the ugly\ndictator and saves the rich Kuwaitis...

763
01:03:04,664 --> 01:03:07,656
...but you go to jail if you help us\nescape the same dictator?

764
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:18,400
Look at my daughter.

765
01:03:21,347 --> 01:03:22,849
Who's going?

766
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,841
Everyone but the priests.\nThat makes 55.

767
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:41,656
Did we save anything from the Humvee?

768
01:03:42,668 --> 01:03:45,660
Vig's bag.

769
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:52,667
Lovely.

770
01:03:53,513 --> 01:03:55,548
What is your rank, bro?

771
01:03:55,548 --> 01:03:57,416
Sergeant first class.

772
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,352
Your company?

773
01:03:59,352 --> 01:04:02,344
437 Civil Affairs Company,\nU.S. Army Reserve.

774
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:07,760
My main man...

775
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,752
...tell me something, okay?

776
01:04:11,063 --> 01:04:14,055
What is the problem\nwith Michael Jackson?

777
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,702
What do you mean?

778
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:19,694
What is the problem\nwith Michael Jackson?

779
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:26,067
What is the problem\nwith Michael Jackson?

780
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:31,206
You understand my question?

781
01:04:31,884 --> 01:04:33,219
I'm not sure l do.

782
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:36,211
The King of Pop.

783
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:38,791
Michael Jackson.

784
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,727
He come to Egypt.\nI see picture in newspaper.

785
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,719
''Hello,'' with the white glove.\n''I'm Michael Jackson in my hotel room...

786
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:48,557
...with my chop up face.'' Your country\nmake him chop up his face.

787
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:53,228
I don't think so.

788
01:04:55,408 --> 01:04:58,400
That's bullshit. He did it to himseIf.

789
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:04,906
You are the blind bullshit,\nmy main man.

790
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,020
It is so obvious a black man...

791
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,012
...make the skin white and the hair\nstraight, and you know why?

792
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:13,492
no.

793
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,484
Your sick fucking country make the black\nman hate himseIf...

794
01:05:17,096 --> 01:05:20,088
...just like you hate the Arab\nand the children you bomb over here.

795
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,002
I don't hate children.

796
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,994
This is illegal. The war is over.\nThat's why you are illegal.

797
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:29,230
You broke the cease fire, and I think\neven you steal the gold.

798
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:32,534
So nobody know where you are, right?\nYour Army don't know.

799
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,338
I'll send you to Baghdad for a long\ntime. nobody found you.

800
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:44,190
Do they care, buddy?\nDoes who care?

801
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,182
Do your Army care about the children\nin lraq? Do they come back to help?

802
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:51,219
no, they're not coming.

803
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:06,412
Do your Army...

804
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:09,248
...come back to help the people?

805
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:11,417
Tell the truth, dudesky.

806
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,486
Save us the big bummer.

807
01:06:13,486 --> 01:06:16,478
That's the truth.

808
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,910
Does it hurt?

809
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:51,857
I asked you a question, man!\nDoes it hurt?

810
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:54,794
Yes, it hurts.

811
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:57,786
You bomb my family. Do you know that?

812
01:06:58,898 --> 01:07:01,890
You blow up my home. The whole street.

813
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:05,293
My wife is crush by big fucking\nblock of concrete.

814
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:09,297
She lose her legs.

815
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:14,714
That's horrible.\nWhat?

816
01:07:14,714 --> 01:07:16,549
I said that's horrible.

817
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:19,541
My God, buddy. l didn't even told you\nthe horrible part yet.

818
01:07:23,556 --> 01:07:25,791
My son....

819
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,783
My son was killed in his bed.

820
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:33,566
He is 1 years old.

821
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:36,558
He is sleeping with his toy\nwhen the bomb come.

822
01:07:40,406 --> 01:07:42,842
I have a daughter.

823
01:07:42,842 --> 01:07:44,977
Very nice for you, bro.

824
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,479
She's safe in Arizona...

825
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,471
...without the bomb, the concrete and\nall this shit.

826
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:53,341
I'm not from Arizona.

827
01:07:54,253 --> 01:07:56,789
How old is she?

828
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:58,691
One month old.

829
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:01,683
What's her name?

830
01:08:02,595 --> 01:08:04,096
Krystal.

831
01:08:04,096 --> 01:08:07,088
What make you decide to tell me\nabout Krystal, my main man?

832
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,659
Because we're both fathers.

833
01:08:11,937 --> 01:08:14,929
I'm not father no more, dude.\nRemember?

834
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:18,433
My son is dead now.

835
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:22,837
Can you think how it feel\ninside your heart...

836
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:26,808
...if l bomb your daughter?

837
01:08:30,723 --> 01:08:33,715
Worse than death.

838
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,861
That's right.

839
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,853
Worse than death.

840
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:09,851
Y'all think America is Satan, right?\nAmerica is Satan?

841
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,335
What'd they say?

842
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:19,327
They say he want salon.

843
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,542
You cut hair?

844
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,544
Yes.

845
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:28,536
Look, they don't care if they cut\nAmerican hair, Shiite hair, Sunni hair.

846
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:33,675
They just want get rid of Saddam\nand live life. Make business.

847
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,696
He wants to know,\ndo you want to kill every Arab?

848
01:09:43,696 --> 01:09:45,297
That's what I was trained to do.

849
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:48,289
no. That was not our training.\nWe got Arab allies, man.

850
01:09:49,568 --> 01:09:52,560
Yeah, well, we got Arab allies.

851
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,746
He's just had no high school.\nno high school.

852
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:03,738
Don't tell people that.

853
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:09,744
What'd they say?\nHe says you have terrible haircut.

854
01:10:12,758 --> 01:10:15,750
Troy gave me this haircut.\nIt's a badass haircut.

855
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,802
America!

856
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,794
America!

857
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:34,836
America, welcome!

858
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:17,957
How you doing?\n''How are you?''

859
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:20,025
He's happy to welcome America.

860
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:22,027
Thank you.\nWe welcome America!

861
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,019
They're all deserters.\nThey leave Saddam army.

862
01:11:25,798 --> 01:11:28,790
But they help us near Karbala.\nGood man.

863
01:11:35,574 --> 01:11:38,566
no, my friend! The man don't do that.\nOnly the woman.

864
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:42,348
Why's that?

865
01:11:42,348 --> 01:11:44,650
Because it's their custom.

866
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,719
You have a radio?\nno radio.

867
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,188
George Bush get rid Saddams now?

868
01:11:49,188 --> 01:11:51,991
not exactly, no.

869
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:53,492
Congratulation!

870
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:56,484
Would you inform this gentleman\nwe need a vehicle of some kind?

871
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:19,640
From Kuwait.

872
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,593
Let me ask you a question.

873
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:42,775
Infiniti convertible only.

874
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,110
no Lexus convertible. Infiniti only.

875
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,678
Infiniti only.

876
01:12:46,678 --> 01:12:49,670
Exactly what l said.

877
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,774
We use these cars\nto fight Saddam's soldiers.

878
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:56,121
What's so funny?

879
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,489
Cannot take.

880
01:12:57,489 --> 01:13:00,481
What do you mean? We kicked\nSaddam's ass. We definitely take.

881
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,595
We are the United States Army.

882
01:13:03,595 --> 01:13:06,587
You are three guys with a bunch of\ncivilians and no Humvee.

883
01:13:06,865 --> 01:13:09,857
need money. Have no money.\nTo eat, to live.

884
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:15,863
''American Army is huge, with planes\nand tanks. We have nothing.''

885
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:19,901
Listen to me.\nWe will rise up together. Tell him.

886
01:13:20,612 --> 01:13:22,047
Rise up.

887
01:13:22,047 --> 01:13:25,039
Look at us. Many races.

888
01:13:25,217 --> 01:13:28,209
Many nations, many nations.\nWorking together.

889
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:30,456
Tell him, Chief.\nWe're united.

890
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:33,448
United.

891
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:43,402
Wants you!

892
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:44,570
He wants everybody.

893
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,339
Yes! Me and you stand up together!

894
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:50,331
We fight. Kick Saddam's ass!

895
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:55,069
George Bush wants you!

896
01:14:01,587 --> 01:14:04,579
Make the fight for freedom on your own!\nThen America will follow!

897
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:06,859
Praise the Lord!

898
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:09,851
God bless America,\nand God bless a free lraq!

899
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:21,229
Free lraq!

900
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,743
Free lraq!

901
01:14:24,743 --> 01:14:26,678
now, what do you say, my friend?

902
01:14:26,678 --> 01:14:29,670
Cannot give car.

903
01:14:29,848 --> 01:14:32,840
I guess we'll buy them.

904
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:44,886
Come on, man. This is good music.\nJudas Priest will pump you up!

905
01:14:45,531 --> 01:14:48,523
no! We're not listening to that\nheadache music.

906
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:50,169
Just one song.

907
01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:53,161
What you need is that\neasy listening classics.

908
01:14:53,672 --> 01:14:55,607
I do not need that.

909
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:58,599
You need something to calm you.

910
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,171
All right, try this.

911
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:14,248
This is from Barlow's wife in Detroit.\nThey may have a position on him.

912
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:18,430
From his wife in Detroit?

913
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,422
What the hell is this?

914
01:15:25,037 --> 01:15:27,706
I was managed by the military.\nMe too.

915
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:30,709
I try to be substance based,\nnot style based.

916
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:32,211
I think you got style.

917
01:15:32,211 --> 01:15:34,346
That little Cathy bitch\nsays I'm old.

918
01:15:34,346 --> 01:15:36,181
That's because she's jealous.

919
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:39,173
First of all, you're smarter than her,\nand that is a threat.

920
01:15:39,685 --> 01:15:42,654
And second of all, you are beautiful.

921
01:15:42,654 --> 01:15:45,646
You're the most prettiest woman down\nthere at that network.

922
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:49,817
You got great skin. Beautiful hair.

923
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:54,422
That's sweet, but there's\nsexual politics in this business.

924
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:57,658
It's about looks. It's about sex.\nIt's about style.

925
01:15:58,337 --> 01:16:01,073
Many anchormen came on to me,\nand I didn't go for it.

926
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:04,065
I never played that game or dropped\nto my knees for an assignment.

927
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:15,870
I only joined Saddam Hussein army\nto make good living for my family.

928
01:16:17,215 --> 01:16:19,418
Good house.

929
01:16:19,418 --> 01:16:22,387
Now I can't get out.

930
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:25,379
I joined up for the extra cash too.

931
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,726
Found out I was gonna have a baby.

932
01:16:27,726 --> 01:16:30,718
You know, l got weapon and training\nfrom America.

933
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:33,465
Bullshit.

934
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,901
How you think l learned my English?

935
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:37,669
Specialist guys come here...

936
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:40,505
...to train us when we fight lran.

937
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:43,497
What'd they train you in?

938
01:16:44,443 --> 01:16:46,278
...interrogation.

939
01:16:46,278 --> 01:16:48,513
Great.

940
01:16:48,513 --> 01:16:51,505
It was a total waste for your Army\nto come to lraq, right?

941
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:55,876
I heard about a lot of bad shit that\nhappened in Kuwait.

942
01:16:56,121 --> 01:16:59,124
Bad shit happened.\nI'm not proud of that.

943
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:00,826
Who's got the sick country?

944
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:02,928
Maybe Saddam is very crazy.

945
01:17:02,928 --> 01:17:05,597
And then you are crazy to bomb\nall of lraq.

946
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:08,589
Too much bombing is crazy,\nbut not saving Kuwait.

947
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:12,259
You are here for save Kuwaiti people?

948
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:15,463
Really?

949
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:21,635
Lot of people in trouble\nin this world...

950
01:17:23,548 --> 01:17:25,550
You can't invade another country.

951
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,719
Why not, dude?

952
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:30,711
It makes the world crazy.\nYou need to keep it stable.

953
01:17:32,824 --> 01:17:35,816
no, for stability.\nStabilize the region.

954
01:17:52,177 --> 01:17:55,169
This is your fucking stability,\nmy main man.

955
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:09,183
We get our man, then we come back\nand pick up the gold.

956
01:18:10,195 --> 01:18:13,187
And my people?\nThat's right.

957
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,724
Let's go over the plan.

958
01:18:19,704 --> 01:18:22,696
There's a bunker built into the side\nof the cliff face.

959
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:26,066
Looks like a castle. There's a road\ncoming there, another one across.

960
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:29,737
It's full of Saddam's Republican Guard.\nI don't think we can overpower them.

961
01:18:31,483 --> 01:18:32,918
There's too many.

962
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:35,053
But there's one thing they're afraid of.

963
01:18:35,053 --> 01:18:36,555
What's that?

964
01:18:36,555 --> 01:18:39,224
Saddam.

965
01:18:39,224 --> 01:18:41,059
Then that's what we use.

966
01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:43,895
Right. That's what we'll use.

967
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:46,887
You stay with me.

968
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:50,391
You stay with me.

969
01:18:57,576 --> 01:19:00,568
Hold on. l wanna go over\nthis plan one more time.

970
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:02,747
You're scared, right?

971
01:19:02,747 --> 01:19:04,616
Maybe.

972
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:07,608
The way this works is, you do the thing\nyou're scared shitless of...

973
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,111
...and you get the courage after\nyou do it. not before you do it.

974
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:16,116
That's a dumb ass way to work.\nIt should be the other way around.

975
01:19:16,761 --> 01:19:18,797
I know.

976
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:21,789
That's the way it works.

977
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:40,961
I got a splinter.

978
01:23:14,966 --> 01:23:17,958
Jesus fire, Jesus fire, Jesus fire....

979
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:11,656
Come on.

980
01:24:11,656 --> 01:24:14,648
Quickly.

981
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:33,567
Oh, shit!

982
01:24:58,036 --> 01:24:59,537
You all right?

983
01:24:59,537 --> 01:25:02,529
Shit, you're dead.

984
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:28,522
Wait! Wait!

985
01:25:34,138 --> 01:25:37,130
Shit.

986
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,902
Let's get out of here.

987
01:28:31,282 --> 01:28:34,274
Where's Conrad?

988
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:42,482
Keep your guard up.

989
01:28:57,808 --> 01:28:59,377
Are you okay?

990
01:28:59,377 --> 01:29:02,346
Where's Conrad?\nHow are we getting back?

991
01:29:02,346 --> 01:29:05,338
We got the Rolls.\nYou got a Rolls?

992
01:29:08,986 --> 01:29:11,978
This is an Infiniti convertible.

993
01:29:13,457 --> 01:29:16,449
Man, I think you're in shock.

994
01:29:17,595 --> 01:29:19,597
It's an Infiniti convertible, isn't it?

995
01:29:19,597 --> 01:29:20,798
Yeah, it is.

996
01:29:20,798 --> 01:29:23,668
Okay, so l owe you a car.\nI'm not in shock.

997
01:29:23,668 --> 01:29:25,636
Sure you're okay?

998
01:29:25,636 --> 01:29:27,772
Freeze!

999
01:29:27,772 --> 01:29:29,473
no! He's with us!

1000
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:32,243
Don't shoot him! He's with us!

1001
01:29:32,243 --> 01:29:35,235
You're the guy with the little girl.\nThat's right.

1002
01:29:35,346 --> 01:29:36,847
What are you doing here?

1003
01:29:36,847 --> 01:29:39,839
He helped us find you.\nl came here to help you.

1004
01:29:40,551 --> 01:29:43,543
All right. You're all right, man!

1005
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:48,159
I see some people.

1006
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,328
I can't see what's happening. Stay put.

1007
01:29:50,328 --> 01:29:52,863
How's your little girl?\nShe's safe for now.

1008
01:29:52,863 --> 01:29:55,633
Outstanding! Excellent!\nHow can we help you?

1009
01:29:55,633 --> 01:29:58,625
We had a deal to get to the border, but\nwe have more people and need vehicles.

1010
01:29:59,837 --> 01:30:02,039
That's not a problem.\nWe'll work it out.

1011
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:04,075
We have to do this. We can work it out.

1012
01:30:04,075 --> 01:30:06,911
I don't know. It's a lot of people.

1013
01:30:06,911 --> 01:30:09,903
You choose who we take. Tell the\nothers they'll have to die.

1014
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:13,406
l can't do that.\nYou'll have to do that yourseIf.

1015
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,062
You made it, man!

1016
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:27,031
I thought that was you!

1017
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:30,023
Where the fuck have you been?

1018
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,254
What are you wearing?

1019
01:30:50,254 --> 01:30:51,689
What is this?

1020
01:30:51,689 --> 01:30:54,625
It's a suit jacket.\nThe lraqis gave it to me.

1021
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:56,127
I didn't recognize you in it.

1022
01:30:56,127 --> 01:30:59,119
It fits all right, right?

1023
01:31:00,998 --> 01:31:02,466
I'm okay.

1024
01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:04,101
Where's he hit?

1025
01:31:04,101 --> 01:31:07,093
It's in and out. I think\nit's above his collarbone.

1026
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:10,007
Where's the Jesus fire?

1027
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:12,999
It's all around you right now.\nYou'll be all right.

1028
01:31:13,144 --> 01:31:14,345
You'll be all right.

1029
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:16,013
I'm going to hell.

1030
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:17,948
You're gonna be fine.

1031
01:31:17,948 --> 01:31:20,940
Can you take me to a shrine that gives\nyou comfort and erases your bad deeds?

1032
01:31:22,353 --> 01:31:25,156
We made the right choice today.

1033
01:31:25,156 --> 01:31:27,858
Stop with that shrine shit.\nIt'll be okay.

1034
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:30,027
You think so?\nl know so!

1035
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:32,563
We're getting out of here.\nHey, major!

1036
01:31:32,563 --> 01:31:35,555
Would you please fucking help  !

1037
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,692
Goddamn it!

1038
01:31:58,422 --> 01:32:00,124
What's the matter, man?

1039
01:32:00,124 --> 01:32:03,127
Can you breathe?

1040
01:32:03,127 --> 01:32:06,119
Can you breathe?

1041
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,952
There's air in his chest.\nIt's crushing his lung.

1042
01:33:22,373 --> 01:33:24,442
Does that feel better, man?

1043
01:33:24,442 --> 01:33:27,434
That feel better?

1044
01:33:35,386 --> 01:33:38,378
He's gone.

1045
01:33:39,623 --> 01:33:42,560
Air pressure's going to build up about\nevery 1 5 minutes.

1046
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,552
Release the valve and close it back up.

1047
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:48,599
How long can I keep doing that?\nI don't know.

1048
01:33:48,599 --> 01:33:51,591
Maybe 4 or 5 hours, if you're not\nbleeding too bad. You don't seem to be.

1049
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,672
He said he wanted\nto go to one of those shrines.

1050
01:34:40,217 --> 01:34:42,386
Did he mean that?

1051
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:45,022
That's what he told me.

1052
01:34:45,022 --> 01:34:48,014
Kerman, lran. We can take him with us.

1053
01:34:49,026 --> 01:34:52,018
Then take him.

1054
01:34:52,463 --> 01:34:55,455
All right. Take him there.

1055
01:35:34,405 --> 01:35:37,397
We found a radio inside.\nYou're hooked for that call, major.

1056
01:35:49,286 --> 01:35:52,278
Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1057
01:35:52,556 --> 01:35:54,525
We're going to jail.

1058
01:35:54,525 --> 01:35:57,517
no, we're not.\nBolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1059
01:35:58,228 --> 01:35:59,730
This is Bolo. Come in.

1060
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:01,198
<i>Where are you?</i>

1061
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:03,667
About two clicks outside of camp.

1062
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:05,869
We're ready for that briar patch.

1063
01:36:05,869 --> 01:36:08,861
I want to find out where we're going.\nPlease! I'm transmitting code!

1064
01:36:10,074 --> 01:36:11,408
You got me, Bolo?

1065
01:36:11,408 --> 01:36:14,400
<i>I think so.</i>

1066
01:36:16,246 --> 01:36:18,382
You do.

1067
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:21,374
Tar Baby goes to the briar patch\nif everything's okay.

1068
01:36:21,452 --> 01:36:24,121
no. It's the other way around.

1069
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:27,113
Sorry, sir. I don't\nremember how the code goes.

1070
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:30,617
l need four personnel trucks\nand a Humvee.

1071
01:36:30,861 --> 01:36:33,853
That's a pretty tall order\nfor a secret operation, sir.

1072
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:37,423
Talk to my friend Teebaux.\nEach driver will get a hundred K.

1073
01:36:38,636 --> 01:36:40,537
Brer Rabbit at 239 north.

1074
01:36:40,537 --> 01:36:43,529
Add one Medevac pack to the order.\nMake sure you bring the reporter.

1075
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:47,700
<i>Roger. Give me two hours.</i>

1076
01:37:32,823 --> 01:37:35,092
Bury those real good, Chief.

1077
01:37:35,092 --> 01:37:38,084
After we take them to the border,\nwe figure out a way to get it out.

1078
01:37:40,197 --> 01:37:43,189
223 north is the position his wife gave.\nThere's just an empty bunker there.

1079
01:37:44,034 --> 01:37:46,670
Task air recon to cover\n223 north to the border.

1080
01:37:46,670 --> 01:37:48,372
I'll put choppers on standby.

1081
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:50,908
If they're there, they won't be\nhard to find.

1082
01:37:50,908 --> 01:37:53,900
All the way, sir.

1083
01:38:21,371 --> 01:38:22,840
Are you all right?

1084
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,642
It's not me.\nBarlow could use some morphine.

1085
01:38:25,642 --> 01:38:28,634
They got him.\nLet's see about you.

1086
01:38:41,759 --> 01:38:44,751
Did you get the gold?\nno, but we helped a lot of people.

1087
01:38:45,028 --> 01:38:48,020
Now we have to get them\nover the border.

1088
01:38:48,432 --> 01:38:51,424
They'll be killed without protection.\nThey're gonna bust you for that.

1089
01:38:52,503 --> 01:38:55,495
Cover it and see what happens.

1090
01:39:08,485 --> 01:39:11,477
Sure you're not coming with us?

1091
01:39:15,325 --> 01:39:18,317
Good luck.

1092
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,369
Sit down.\nWe're gonna pull out fast.

1093
01:39:25,369 --> 01:39:27,337
Everybody sit down.\nWe're going.

1094
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:29,006
Walter, did you meet everybody?

1095
01:39:29,006 --> 01:39:31,998
Walter, this is Kaied.

1096
01:40:43,847 --> 01:40:46,839
What are you thinking?

1097
01:40:49,219 --> 01:40:52,211
We walk them past the lraqi soldiers.\nMake sure they're safe.

1098
01:40:52,956 --> 01:40:55,893
We walk back to the trucks\nand get out of here.

1099
01:40:55,893 --> 01:40:58,885
All right, let's do it!

1100
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:04,590
no guns. Only American soldiers\ncarry guns.

1101
01:41:10,807 --> 01:41:13,210
We are just now about....

1102
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,202
We're getting it now? We're about 25\nyards from an lraqi checkpoint...

1103
01:41:18,015 --> 01:41:20,484
...heading into lran.

1104
01:41:20,484 --> 01:41:23,476
We are just about to move across the\nzone up into the lranian border.

1105
01:41:25,656 --> 01:41:27,424
It's a barbed wire point.

1106
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:30,416
We have men, women and children here...

1107
01:41:31,161 --> 01:41:34,153
...assumed to be lraqi refugees\ncrossing over into lran.

1108
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,190
Make sure they take care of Conrad.\nl will.

1109
01:41:46,243 --> 01:41:49,235
Keep in a tight group.

1110
01:41:52,849 --> 01:41:55,385
This is a violation of American policy.

1111
01:41:55,385 --> 01:41:58,377
The United States has\nwithdrawn its support.

1112
01:42:03,527 --> 01:42:06,519
Let's cut and go again.

1113
01:42:29,653 --> 01:42:32,645
<i>You are AWOL, and you are in violation</i>\n<i>of American policy.</i>

1114
01:42:33,924 --> 01:42:35,258
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

1115
01:42:35,258 --> 01:42:37,627
Double time! Let's go!

1116
01:42:37,627 --> 01:42:40,619
We can make it before they stop us!

1117
01:42:49,606 --> 01:42:52,598
<i>Arrest them! Get them away</i>\n<i>from those refugees!</i>

1118
01:42:55,012 --> 01:42:58,004
Let's go!

1119
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,521
Watch out!

1120
01:43:04,521 --> 01:43:07,513
You're under arrest!

1121
01:43:11,294 --> 01:43:12,796
Go!

1122
01:43:12,796 --> 01:43:15,632
Let me get her over!

1123
01:43:15,632 --> 01:43:18,001
Let me get her over!

1124
01:43:18,001 --> 01:43:20,993
Wait! Just let them get over first!\nWait!

1125
01:43:21,038 --> 01:43:24,030
l need to reach this valve in my chest.

1126
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:27,544
Look what's happening!\nJust let them get over!

1127
01:43:27,544 --> 01:43:30,547
Help these people get across!\nYou cannot support them!

1128
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:33,316
Let me get them across,\nand I'll go right with you!

1129
01:43:33,316 --> 01:43:36,308
Let's go! You're coming with me!

1130
01:43:39,389 --> 01:43:42,125
They'll be slaughtered\nif we don't help them!

1131
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:44,728
Why you doing this?\nThey'll kill them!

1132
01:43:44,728 --> 01:43:47,720
The refugees are not crossing the border.\nThey have been rounded up....

1133
01:43:52,969 --> 01:43:54,271
Let them get over!

1134
01:43:54,271 --> 01:43:57,263
That's not our mission!\nYou don't belong here!

1135
01:43:58,942 --> 01:44:01,934
We're not involved in this problem!\nUnderstand?

1136
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:04,114
You're AWOL and you're under arrest!

1137
01:44:04,114 --> 01:44:07,106
Will you let them kill those people?\nIt's not right!

1138
01:44:13,123 --> 01:44:14,724
They're arresting them!

1139
01:44:14,724 --> 01:44:15,892
I can't breathe!

1140
01:44:15,892 --> 01:44:18,884
You fucked me, now you're fucked!\nSo shut your mouth!

1141
01:44:20,997 --> 01:44:22,499
I need to reach this!

1142
01:44:22,499 --> 01:44:24,067
Give this man medical attention!

1143
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:26,736
We're not involved in this problem here!

1144
01:44:26,736 --> 01:44:28,305
You're way out of line!

1145
01:44:28,305 --> 01:44:30,107
Look at him!

1146
01:44:30,107 --> 01:44:32,843
I can't reach the valve!\nHe can't breathe!

1147
01:44:32,843 --> 01:44:35,579
Put the cuffs on the front!

1148
01:44:35,579 --> 01:44:38,571
You don't worry about him!\nWorry about yourseIf!

1149
01:44:43,253 --> 01:44:45,755
What the hell is this?\nTurn that camera off!

1150
01:44:45,755 --> 01:44:48,592
That's a $ 70,000 camera!\nWhat are you doing here?!

1151
01:44:48,592 --> 01:44:51,584
I'm authorized

1152
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:54,653
He's gonna die!

1153
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:00,092
Cut his cuffs!

1154
01:45:23,727 --> 01:45:26,719
All we had to do was help them!\nIt was less than 1 00 feet!

1155
01:45:49,986 --> 01:45:52,978
We got the gold.

1156
01:45:54,824 --> 01:45:57,816
The Kuwaiti bullion. We've got it.\nBullshit.

1157
01:46:00,096 --> 01:46:01,865
Hold that bag. Give me that bag!

1158
01:46:01,865 --> 01:46:04,857
Get the bag.

1159
01:46:17,214 --> 01:46:19,849
How much do you have?\nTwenty three million.

1160
01:46:19,849 --> 01:46:21,351
Where's it at?

1161
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:23,186
Get those people over first.

1162
01:46:23,186 --> 01:46:25,522
They helped us find it, Ron.

1163
01:46:25,522 --> 01:46:28,514
We made a deal. It's a soldier's honor.\nYou can't fuck them now.

1164
01:46:32,696 --> 01:46:35,688
Come on. Return the gold.

1165
01:46:35,865 --> 01:46:38,857
Save some refugees. Get that star.

1166
01:46:42,706 --> 01:46:45,698
Let's go, Doug.

1167
01:46:53,717 --> 01:46:56,709
Who's in charge here?

1168
01:47:22,912 --> 01:47:25,346
You're under arrest.\You'll be court martialed...
