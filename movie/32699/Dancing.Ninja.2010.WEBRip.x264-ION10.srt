00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,419
There is an ancient legend,

2
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,190
some say over
a thousand years old,

3
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:32,626
about a foreign child,
an orphan,

4
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,063
who was lost
and without direction.

5
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,105
The legend says
his feet will fly,

6
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:50,144
and he will overcome many
enemies to find his true home,

7
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,146
his true family,

8
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,249
and eventually his true love.

9
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,318
[baby coos]

10
00:01:57,418 --> 00:02:02,923
This is the legend
of the Dancing Ninja.

11
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,342
Hi, son.

12
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,445
[flies buzzing]

13
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:25,846
- Papa-san.
- Hmm?

14
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,649
Why is business better
at all the other shops?

15
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,319
Very bad location.
No street traffic.

16
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,792
- Take delivery to Mr. Shi.
- Yes, Papa-san.

17
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:58,846
The legend says this child
will be an outsider,

18
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,350
one who is not accepted
by his peers.

19
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,985
But deep inside,

20
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,721
within the recesses
of his very soul...

21
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,990
Here you are, Mr. Shi,
your fish and cake.

22
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,462
...there is a destiny
that must be fulfilled.

Push harder!

29
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,271
You will never be ninja!

30
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,148
Hard! Faster!

31
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,293
Good power.

32
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,868
Kimi, very nice.

Set. Hai!

36
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,238
No.

37
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,414
Set.

38
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,549
Hai!

39
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,430
Whoa!

40
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,755
Impossible.

41
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,630
Thank you, Ikki.

42
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,699
See you later, Mr. Shi.

43

* Sometimes you need
more than that *

to see you again *

for you to come back *

do your dance *

Hi-ya!

You are getting worse and worse.

60
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,787
Sabu, I really want
to be a ninja.

61
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:50,123
Ikki, one does not want
to become a ninja.

62
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,626
One either is
or is not a ninja,

63
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,061
and you are not a ninja.

64
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,297
Ooh, I'm so disappointed!

65
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,032
You can do better!

* Keep on trying
and you will shine *

that you could *

you will be mine *

if you really want some more *

* More, more, more
Yeah, we can lock the room *

81
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,414
* We can make it through

82
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,750

anything like this!

Ready?

00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,633
Begin!

90
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,682
You ready?

91
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,653
You win.

92
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,857
* Yeah, we can lock the room

93
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:33,560
* We can make it cool
So come and make it groove *

94

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,636
Perfect!

97
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,177
- Okay, Mama-san, nice pose.
- Okay.

98
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,712
This video will sell good.

99
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,818
Ikki-san, where are you going?

100
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:02,923
To go see Sabu to tell him
I have mastered the dance!

101
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,357
Okay, okay.

102
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,528
Okay, come on now,
we finish video.

103
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,065
Yeah, baby, arch your back,
lick your lips.

104
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,667
I've heard there is a legend.

105
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,938
Ha. What legend?

106
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,774
The Legend of the Dancing Ninja.

107
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,210
He studies hard
and becomes so disciplined

108
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,611
that he saves the world.

109
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,214
[laughs]
You are a naÃ¯ve child.

110
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,717
That is ridiculous!
It is a fable.

111
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,786
But that's not what
the other ninjas say.

112
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,923
And if it is true,
I have to be him.

113
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:38,291
[scoffs]

114
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,362
The ninjas of legend
are cold and hard,

115
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,098
but the insides burn like fire.

116
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,535
A boiling core of repressed chi
ignites their abilities.

117
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,138
You show no signs of what
a dancing ninja can do.

118
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,773
Can you do this?

119
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,753
Ugh!

120
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,623
Ah.

121
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,259
Whoa!

122
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,494
That was a cool hip move, Sabu.

123
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,833
Cool hip?

124
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,634
Mm-hmm.

125
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,406
When you learn that,
come see me.

126
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,476
But, Sabu,
it sounds to me

127
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,512
like you just admitted
there is a Dancing Ninja.

128
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,914
It sounds to me, Ikki,

129
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,284
like you are getting
on my nerves!

130
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,585
You will see, Sabu.

131
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,821
I will train hard,
and I will show you.

132
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,329
[clears throat]

133
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,764
It is not for me to say, Sabu,

134
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:56,203
but I think you treat him
in an unusual way.

135
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,670
Really?

136
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,342
Do not question
my training methods.

137
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,678
Did you just say,
"training method"?

138
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,114
Stand!

139
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,515
Everyone stand!

140
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,816
Two hours!

141
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,552
Do not move!

142
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,957
And someone clean up that rice!

143
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,526
But do not move!

144
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,165
**

145
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,535
Sabu, you asked for me?

146
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,537
- I'm not your Sabu.
- Oh, sorry.

147
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,106
Yes, Ikki,

148
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,907
I asked you here to return
these videos to your mother

149
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,177
before she stick me
with late charge.

150
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,544
Also...

151
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:15,348
I've sensed
that you are troubled,

152
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,717
and I decided
that this one time only

153
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,221
I will give advice, in an
unofficial capacity, of course.

154
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,922
Thank you, Sabu.

155
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,691
- That's very kind of you.
- [coughs]

156
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,460
I mean, that is very kind
of you, not my Sabu.

157
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,562
It is no problem,
not my student.

158
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,532
Now, what troubles you?

159
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,268
I do not know who I am.

160
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,469
That is simple.

161
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,771
You are a poor orphan boy.

162
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,407
You survived
a terrible shipwreck,

163
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,641
washed upon the shore.

164
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,743
Your Papa-san find you,
crying baby,

165
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,645
take you home,
you live your life.

166
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,614
Tragic, I know,
but get over it.

167
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,482
Return videos.

168
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,751
But, Sabu, this is why
I have nightmares.

169
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,153
It is close to overdue time.

170
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,723
Your mother don't even
give ninja a break! Go!

171
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,093
Ah, hello!

172
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,494
Mmm!

173
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,098
You look so... tasty.

174
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,666
I like that.

175
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,969
Now I know the big difference.

176
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,771
I'm the only one

177
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,808
that doesn't know anything
about myself at all.

178
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,611
Ikki.

179
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,781
Come here.

180
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,685
Listen to me.

181
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:28,921
Finding your true self

182
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,492
comes from the enlightenment
of knowing a woman.

183
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:36,296
You must release the burning chi
inside you.

184
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,165
It grows stronger
every day.

185
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,200
You can feel it.

186
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,802
I do not understand.

187
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,173
Just ask your parents.
I'm sure they do.

188
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,610
But my parents are just
simple shop owners,

189
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,380
other than their
instructional DVD business.

190
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,149
Which are very good,
by the way.

191
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,650
Thank you.

192
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,987
But they know nothing
of ninja training.

193
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:05,024
Ikki, find a woman,
become a man.

194
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,629
Only then can you know
who you really are.

195
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,133
Oh, Ikki.

196
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:20,407
I pay late charge
on this one. Go.

197
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:24,711
Mmm. "Seven Habits of
Highly Successful Geishas."

198
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,479
Well...
[spanks]

199
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,716
I teach you nine.
[laughs]

200
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,704
You must release
the burning chi inside you.

201
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,875
Only then can you know
who you really are.

202
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:14,594
[clattering]

203
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,108
My parents' video business.

204
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,213
I'm out of control.

205
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,012
Look what you've done.

206
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,849
I do not want to cause
any trouble.

207
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,355
I told you.
I do not want any trouble.

208
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:19,426
You know what? I don't like
people messing with my clothes.

209
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,798
Please!

210
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,868
I don't want to fight!

211
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,845
**

212
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,689
* Hey, yo
It's about to go down *

213
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,024
* And you and I know
I could take these clowns *

214
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,560
* I'll fight the fight
day and night *

215
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,495
* You wanna bring it on
Just what I like *

216
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,630
* So check what you see
if you wanna step to me *

217
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,467
* I'm that guy who got that chi
I drop it like it's hot *

218
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,535
* You want another taste
of what I got, homeboy *

219
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,036
* Uh, you must be loco

220
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,638
* You wanna step
to my ninja flow *

221
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,340
* Come on

222
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,725
* Yeah, ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

223
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,529
* You want a ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

224
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:33,433
* I got your ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

225
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,836
* You want a ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

226
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,273
** [continues]

227
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,461
* Ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

228
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:05,898
* You want a ninja fight
I got your ninja fight *

229
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,369
Damn!

230
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,408
You're like a ninja master
or something.

231
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,445
Maybe I am.

232
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:22,281
Have you ever heard of
the Legend of the Dancing Ninja?

233
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,816
No.

234
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,152
Well, it's
an interesting legend.

235
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,921
It foretells of a ninja
who dances, of course,

236
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,423
and then he fights and...

237
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,158
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

238
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,594
We're sorry for
starting beef with you.

239
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,096
Teach us your cool moves.

240
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,901
Please?

241
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:48,007
* Dance with you
I wanna dance good for you *

242
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:56,082
* Dance with you
I wanna dance good for you *

243
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,961
* Let the music explode

244
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,130
* When we walk in the door

245
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:15,201
* Now it's time to move *

246
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,471
* So get on the floor

247
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,942
* Get on the floor

248
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,878
* Get on the floor

249
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,519
* Get on the floor

250
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,222
* Get on the floor

251
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,027
* Get on the floor

252
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,071
Press in, press out.

253
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,575
Feel the burn. Good.

254
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,376
Press out.

255
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:01,213
Okay, three...

256
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,915
two...

257
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,917
...one more!

258
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,519
Okay.

259
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:07,754
Very good.

260
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,724
Your ninja abilities grow
with each repetition.

261
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,762
Soon you'll be ready
for full power machine.

262
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,564
Go. Join the others.

263
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,583
Adoring fans loved him

264
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,752
as an international movie star
all through the '90s.

265
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:43,756
It may be a few years since
iconic figure Ansel LaDouche

266
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,057
starred in a movie,

267
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,259
and some say his career
is behind him,

268
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,261
but this master
of the martial arts

269
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,863
has turned entrepreneur.

270
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,399
Rumor is he will be
the face of the about-to-launch

271
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,234
24-Hour Fighting Channel,

272
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,804
and from there, an entirely new
series of movies.

273
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,440
So while some say "washed up,"
we're not so sure.

274
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,043
This is Heidi Holdem for
Entertainment Hollywood.

275
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,113
W-W-Washed up?

276
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,216
Did she say I was washed up?

277
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,985
She's a dick.

278
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,289
I hate this place.

279
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,059
If I didn't have
to get those plans,

280
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,495
I'd never set foot
in this rat hole again.

281
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,730
It's a pit.

282
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,232
Let's just get that scroll
and get out.

283
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,748
Okay, step three.

284
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,517
Right lever tension.
[grunts]

285
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,687
- Left lever stretch.
- [groans]

286
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:51,190
Master, you've done this for me
so often.

287
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,459
Now it's my turn
to help you stretch.

288
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,262
[groans]
I don't want your help.

289
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,665
Oh, don't be that way.

290
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,299
What you've done for me

291
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,535
has turned my life
into a mega empire!

292
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,836
[groans]

293
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,437
What I taught you was sacred.

294
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:08,174
You have taken it and turned
yourself into a mockery.

295
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:12,278
You are a disgrace.

296
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:17,016
I am loved by millions.

297
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,184
[chuckles]

298
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,386
Maybe in your own mind,
LaDouche.

299
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:25,524
But in the real world,
you are despised.

300
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,960
I am not despised!

301
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,062
I am feared!

302
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,497
[sighs]

303
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,033
You need me!

304
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,235
I need nothing from you.

305
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,670
You want to live?

306
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,207
Get out now, LaDouche,
while I still allow it.

307
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,042
Then you come with me.

308
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:47,179
Together with this machine,
we can conquer the world!

309
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:50,249
No.This is not a toy

310
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,019
or a trinket to be sold on
Hollywood Boulevard.

311
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,654
This is a dangerous machine

312
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,656
and cannot be trusted
with the likes of you.

313
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:59,992
I would rather stick a needle
in my eye than help you.

314
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,494
This exercise is done!

315
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,599
[shouts]

316
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,569
Oh, shit.

317
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,878
Wah... huh!

318
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,252
Huh!

319
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,790
[chuckles]
Your powers are weak.

320
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:38,264
Just like old times, huh?

321
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,237
[yelling]

322
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:12,131
Ohhh...

323
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,171
Oh, you're pretty.

324
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,473
[gunshot]

325
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,778
Really?

326
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,279
A gun?

327
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,760
I hope you don't mind
me taking these.

328
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,295
[chuckles]

329
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:47,867
[coughs]
Actually, I do mind.

330
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,468
A lot.

331
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,703
[groans]

332
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,977
Excuse me.
I am sorry.

333
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,147
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, we should celebrate, huh?

334
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,049
- Oh, yes.
- Sushi?

335
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,116
Sake.

336
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,685
Okay, this is not good.

337
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,354
[banging on door]

338
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,323
Sabu, it is I, Ikki-san.

339
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,725
I must speak with you.

340
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,294
Uh, Ikki, go away.

341
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,029
Did you say come in?

342
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,365
No!

343
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:22,201
Sabu, Sabu!

344
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,839
Sabu!

345
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:31,077
I can't find you, Sabu!

346
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:33,712
[scoffs]
I--

347
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,016
- Sabu, where are you?
- Oh, my God.

348
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,985
Sabu.

349
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,253
You are bleeding.

350
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,055
No, I'm not.

351
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,824
Go away!

352
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:48,727
Holy Shinto, Sabu.
We need to get you a doctor.

353
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:49,929
[coughs]

354
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,197
Oh, my Sabu!

355
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:55,167
I am not your Sabu.
Now go away.

356
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,603
Who did this to you?
Tell me.

357
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,371
I will find him,
and I will kill him.

358
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,274
You cannot avenge my death

359
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:07,113
because you are
no match for LaDouche.

360
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,949
[gasps]
LaDouche?

361
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,590
Your evil student who's made
a mockery of us in America?

362
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:22,128
No, it's not him.
Did I say LaDouche?

363
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:26,565
No, I'm delirious. Oh!
Oh, I see dead people!

364
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:30,069
It's a sign.
It's clear to me.

365
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:34,473
You had to die for me
to fulfill my destiny.

366
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,943
Ikki, did it ever
occur to you

367
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,546
that not everything
is about you?

368
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,984
No, Sabu, I don't think so.

369
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,087
I will go to America
where LaDouche lives,

370
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,423
and I will avenge your death.

371
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,992
[clears throat]

372
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,827
I'm not dead yet.

373
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,498
After you die, of course.

374
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,467
Okay, well, kill me.

375
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,402
Oh, no, Sabu,
I could not do that.

376
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,104
Oh, come on.

377
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:11,177
[groaning]

378
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,680
[thunder rumbling]

379
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,116
I will avenge your death, Sabu!

380
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:21,921
I will! I will!
I will! I will!

381
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,858
I'm not your Sabu.
And stop hitting me.

382
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,030
[thunderclap]

383
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,799
[crying]

384
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,871
[thunderclap]

385
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:45,044
Ikki, I have packed
your bento box for your trip.

386
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,345
And...

387
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,948
Oh!

388
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,984
In case you finally
get lucky.

389
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:55,387
Mama-san, please.
People will see.

390
00:30:55,487 --> 00:31:00,026
I have little money,
but here, take this.

391
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:01,327
Go see my friend.

392
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,695
He will give you
a place to stay.

393
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:07,633
If he don't remember,
give him this gift.

394
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,036
Thank you, Papa-san.

395
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:13,139
Take care, my son.

396
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,541
Oh, my baby.

397
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,418
- Take care!
- Goodbye.

398
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,860
Goodbye, my family.

399
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,097
Bye-bye.

400
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,867
- Okay.
- [whimpering]

401
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,144
15 guys would be no problem.

402
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,117
[clears throat]

403
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:34,220
Sabu.

404
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,455
Kimi, welcome.

405
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:40,993
I am so sorry you have
passed on to the other world.

406
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,662
Thank you. Me, too.

407
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,932
Although it does have its perks.

408
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:50,269
Hello, girls!
Ahh...

409
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,839
Ah, Kimi, I am concerned
about Ikki and you.

410
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,742
You've been one of my most loyal
and faithful students.

411
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,577
Now I must call on you again.

412
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,980
You must go to America
and watch over Ikki

413
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,183
as you would
your own brother.

414
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,488
Okay.

415
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,758
Yes.

416
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,128
Okay, go.

417
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,031
Hey, girls! Hello!

418
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,168
- One second. Whoa!
- [laughter]

419
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:26,138
Did you know
that I am a ninja master?

420
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,639
Wow...

421
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,047
Die, loser.

422
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,315
Hah!

423
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,118
Loser!

424
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,987
Eat me!

425
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,227
Crystal!

426
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:51,863
I'm feeling a little light
in the biceps.

427
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,674
Oh, that's good juice!

428
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,080
What's next?

429
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,211
I like it.

430
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,273
Honorable Miss, please give
my card to Mr. Pall.

431
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:08,874
He's a dear friend
of my Papa-san

432
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,110
and will provide me
with a place to stay.

433
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,814
I'm sorry, but the only cards
we accept are plastic.

434
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,052
Is Mr. Pall your father?

435
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,290
Yes, it just
so happens he is.

436
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,891
Really?

437
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,827
Papa-san say if problem,

438
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,763
I should present Mr. Pall
with this gift.

439
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,907
Is there a problem?

440
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,610
I'll take care of this
personally.

441
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,811
[bell dings]

442
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:00,959
**

443
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,957
Hey.

444
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,461
- Hello.
- Hi.

445
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,964
You're amazing.
You taught me how to be a ninja.

446
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,800
- What?
- On the dance machine.

447
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,035
You taught me
how to be a ninja.

448
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,471
Wow...

449
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,738
Watch.

450
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,310
[chuckles]
Nice.

451
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,712
Now you go.
I'll follow.

452
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:57,182
** [continues]

453
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,721
Back off, man.

454
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:37,055
Come on.

455
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:39,291
I do not want
to cause any trouble.

456
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,759
[laughing]

457
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,873
Let me put it to you
straight.

458
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:06,044
You will never be
the face of my channel.

459
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,646
You're over.

460
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:11,049
We've, uh...

461
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,651
made another decision.

462
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:14,853
Garland, you're kidding me.

463
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:16,287
[laughs]

464
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:19,391
Who the hell
wants to see that?

465
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:23,662
You need me.

466
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,564
I will...

467
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:27,165
[hisses]

468
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,167
make this channel.

469
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,837
You know, there's rumors
about you, Ansel,

470
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,505
that you're off
your freaking nut.

471
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:36,074
Now we've had
our little meeting.

472
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:38,209
It's time for you to leave.

473
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,012
No, it's time for you
to leave.

474
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,552
This is my office.

475
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:49,354
This is my channel.

476
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,022
[laughs]

477
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:56,361
And this is my universe!

478
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,262
You see?

479
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,865
There's that crazy talk.

480
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,934
Now get it
through your head.

481
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:07,005
I would use any
of the other action stars

482
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,740
before I'd use you.

483
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,376
Any of them. Get it?

484
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,684
Big news for any of you
Ansel LaDouche fans

485
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,085
that exist out there.

486
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,853
Today he was named
the spokesperson

487
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,455
for the 24-Hour
Fight Channel.

488
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:26,024
The owner, Garland Jones,
had this to say.

489
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:31,530
[groaning, mumbling]

490
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,398
[grunts]

491
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:37,402
Thank you, Garland.
I am humbled.

492
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,305
Check back for an exclusive
interview with Mr. LaDouche

493
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,574
at the headquarters
of LaDouche Enterprises

494
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,577
to get the inside story
on his, some would say,

495
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:46,978
surprising comeback.

496
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,981
This is Heidi Holdem for
Entertainment Hollywood.

497
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,421
That Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon flying,

498
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:58,056
I can do that in real life.

499
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,759
Oh, and The Matrix stuff,
that was all based on me,

500
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,160
but they made it look simple.

501
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,662
It's something only
a few people can do,

502
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,597
and I'm the only one left alive,
because, you know...

503
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,933
- Sabu?
- I'm a ninja master.

504
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,502
Did I tell you that? I did?

505
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:12,470
Yeah, I killed 20 men
to protect the gold I had

506
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,339
in the mountains
in Switzerland.

507
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,342
No, it's not easy being me

508
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:20,078
with the level of greatness
I have to maintain.

509
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,080
Did I tell you that
I was a race car driver?

510
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,249
Sabu, this is amazing.

511
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,818
I'm visiting you on
the Plane of Enlightenment.

512
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:30,488
No, you are not, because
you are not capable of it.

513
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,023
You are dreaming.

514
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,661
You're not here,
and neither am I, okay?

515
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:38,597
- Sorry, babe.
- I don't know, Sabu.

516
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,832
- Looks pretty real to me.
- No!

517
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:43,501
The Plane of Enlightenment
is not real to you.

518
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:46,772
To you, it is
what I tell you it is.

519
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:49,875
And I tell you
that it is all in your mind,

520
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,377
and you will never come back.

521
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,112
Wahh...

522
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,816
Sabu, why do tell me
those things?

523
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,318
They don't make any sense,
and I'm just confused.

524
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:04,723
You are confused because
you are not a ninja. Now go.

525
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,294
Wait, wait.
One more thing.

526
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,863
Sabu, if I'm not really here,

527
00:42:11,963 --> 00:42:14,666
then why are you bothering
to tell me to leave?

528
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,067
You understand
what I'm saying?

529
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,303
I will say one thing
one last time.

530
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,973
You are not
the Dancing Ninja.

531
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,712
- What about LaDouche?
- You can't handle LaDouche!

532
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,085
I don't know who that was.

533
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,926
Sabu, he was on
the Plane of Enlightenment.

534
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,994
Is it possible you are wrong?

535
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,563
[grunts]
Kimi-san...

536
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,733
I am not wrong.
I am never wrong.

537
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:52,370
Do not question.
The plan unfolds as it should.

538
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:54,405
Sabu, I need to know.

539
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,107
You will stand still
four hours!

540
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:57,609
Do not question me!

541
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:06,852
Huh! Dead two weeks
and no one listens to me.

542
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,954
Just help him!

543
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,690
Your role will become clear!

544
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,593
Ah, kids!

545
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:20,799
Focus on the mission.
The rest will become clear.

546
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,739
B is good.

547
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:31,542
But I must find him first.

548
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,079
Focus.

549
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,947
Never before in the history
of television

550
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,316
has anyone ever dared
to bring the viewer

551
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,418
what they really desire.

552
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,788
LaDouche and Jones Enterprises
bring you

553
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:47,325
the Fighting Channel,
our 24-hour nonstop brawl

554
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,627
with online offshore gambling.

555
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:53,264
You will see
world-class boxing,

556
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,233
desert combat,

557
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,802
bedroom brawls,

558
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:01,139
and a full hour
of hot animal action.

559
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:07,112
Oh! 24 hours of blood, guts,
and oozing sensuality

560
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:09,647
for your visual
and gambling pleasure,

561
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,917
brought to you by
Ansel LaDouche's

562
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,453
Kung Fu Ninja-ciser.

563
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,625
I'm getting good at this.

564
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:29,200
La-La-La-La-La... Douche.

565
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:51,656
Well, this is quite a device
and quite a place.

566
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:54,192
Thank you.
I designed it myself.

567
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:58,129
Really? Huh.
So shall we get started?

568
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,998
- Roll it!
- Great. Shane?

569
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:06,037
So, Ansel, let's get deep here
for a second.

570
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:09,574
Tell me what makes you
get up in the morning?

571
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:14,245
Alarm clock.
[laughs]

572
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,049
You're funny.
Seriously, though.

573
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,718
Seriously, Heidi,
I just like helping people.

574
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,720
You know,
for the last 25 years,

575
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,089
I've studied
the mystical teachings

576
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:25,924
of a great grand master,

577
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:30,528
a man who I loved deeply,

578
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:35,566
who taught me how powerful
things like giving can be.

579
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,037
I had no idea you were
sensitive like this.

580
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,739
Oh, look at me.
I'm tearing.

581
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,842
Me, too. Oh...

582
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,844
Ooh! And resetting.

583
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:48,346
So...

584
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:35,760
Come on, Ikki.
You can do this.

585
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:36,828
Whoa!

586
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:41,632
Let me ask you
a really tough question, Ansel.

587
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:46,071
Five years ago,
your last film bombed.

588
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,007
You were shunned.

589
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:51,109
You were outcast.

590
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,678
You were box-office poison.

591
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,814
So you disappeared
from the LA scene.

592
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,918
No more movie premieres,
no more charity events,

593
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:02,020
no more weekly card games
with the A-list

594
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,455
or B-list,
for that matter.

595
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:08,293
So what was it?
Emotional problems?

596
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:10,095
Insecurity?

597
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,999
Heidi, I'd given so much
to so many.

598
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,601
I just needed time
to recharge my batteries

599
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,803
to see what I had left.

600
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,007
Hmm. It looks like you've found
quite a lot, haven't you?

601
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,209
Yes, I have.
[laughs]

602
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,178
I mean, don't you just want
to strut your stuff a bit,

603
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,614
flash your peacock feathers
and say to the world,

604
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,650
- "Look at me. I'm a douche."
- Huh?

605
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:36,021
I mean, "I'm LaDouche,
and I'm here to stay."

606
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,056
I just want to wake up
in the morning

607
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:42,293
and be the best Ansel LaDouche
I can be.

608
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,197
* I can't stop this feeling *

609
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,800
* Deep inside of me

610
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:53,238
* Girl, you just
don't realize *

611
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,473
* What you do to me

612
00:47:56,741 --> 00:48:00,078
* When you hold me
in your arms so tight *

613
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:04,916
* You let me know
everything's all right *

614
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:07,718
* I'm *

615
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,888
* Hooked on a feeling

616
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:14,825
* And I'm high
on believing *

617
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:18,997
* That you're in love
with me *

618
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,667
* Ooga shaga
Ooga ooga ooga shaga *

619
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,935
* Ooga ooga

620
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:27,538
- Aaah!
- * Lips as sweet as candy

621
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,442
* Your taste is on my mind

622
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,445
* Girl, you got me thirsty

623
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:38,216
* For another cup of wine

624
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,720
* Got a bug from you, girl

625
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:46,624
* But I don't need no cure *

626
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:49,694
* I'll just stay affected *

627
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,431
* If I can't be sure *

628
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,400
* All the good love

629
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,767
* When we're all alone *

630
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,204
* Keep it up, girl

631
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,706
* Yeah, you turn me on

632
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,542
* I'm *

633
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,445
* Hooked on a feeling

634
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:11,216
* And I'm high on believing *

635
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:15,220
* That you're in love
with me *

636
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,822
[laughs]

637
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:23,394
Boss!

638
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,830
Business first.

639
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,402
Whoa! Where do you think
you're going?

640
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,504
I have to avenge
my Sabu's death.

641
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,141
I don't need this crap tonight,
all right? Get out of here.

642
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,508
No, I won't.

643
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:39,177
Yes, you will.

644
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:41,112
No, I won't.

645
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,913
Yes, you will!

646
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:58,196
Whoa!

647
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,714
- Whoo!
- [laughter]

648
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,825
[laughter]

649
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,670
There's that dude
from somewhere in Asia.

650
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,906
Get the boss out of here.

651
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,711
- Get down!
- Oh, sh--

652
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,424
You are Kimi from the dojo.

653
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,859
Yes, I am, and Sabu sent me.

654
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:05,230
Sabu? Did he say anything about
my being the Dancing Ninja?

655
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,602
Eh...

656
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,604
No, he didn't.

657
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,740
Perhaps you are
and perhaps you are not,

658
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,211
but right now
you must fight like him.

659
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:21,379
Yes, I will.

660
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:23,581
** [swing]

661
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,187
Nice scarf.

662
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:30,288
I'll lead.

663
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,725
Wow.

664
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,167
What the hell's going on?

665
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,669
Ow.

666
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:01,312
Ikki, we have to
get out of here. Let's go.

667
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,680
Who is this guy?

668
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,383
Later. Let's go.

669
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:08,553
Move! Move!

670
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:12,457
- [applauding, whistling]
- Whoo!

671
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,630
They definitely sent him
from the dojo.

672
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,865
You're sure?

673
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,200
I recognized him.
He's good.

674
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:27,838
He had some
crazy dance fighting moves.

675
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,041
What?

676
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,311
What?

677
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:34,712
What did you just say?

678
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:37,715
Crazy dance fighting moves?

679
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:40,485
- Oh! It's him.
- Who?

680
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:43,220
The Dancing Ninja. Ohh!

681
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,857
I can't get him
out of my brain!

682
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,163
There's something
I never told anyone,

683
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,501
something that happened to me
when I was nine.

684
00:53:56,567 --> 00:54:00,838
[thunder rumbling]

685
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,873
Ready to read your fortune,
little boy?

686
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,175
Mommy, I don't want
to do this.

687
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,711
Oh, don't worry, darling.

688
00:54:06,777 --> 00:54:09,780
I'm sure your fortune's
going to be fabulous.

689
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,397
Oh!

690
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,100
What does that mean?

691
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:35,072
You're going to live
a long and fruitful life

692
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,775
with lots of happiness
and laughter.

693
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:43,814
[thunder rumbles]

694
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:47,251
What's that?

695
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:49,420
Death.

696
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:55,626
Oh, well, I think
we should be going.

697
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,396
Wait.

698
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,431
One more.

699
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,102
Oh!

700
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,446
The worst part is...

701
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,848
she left her a tip.

702
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,920
Find him. Get him.

703
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,755
Kill him.

704
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,458
I don't care how you do it.

705
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,127
Just get it done.

706
00:55:31,596 --> 00:55:34,264
This is where
I've been staying.

707
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,000
I know.

708
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:39,937
Wait. Sabu sent you
to protect me?

709
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,139
Yes, he did.

710
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,842
He doesn't believe in me.

711
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,645
He never saw you
like I saw you tonight.

712
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:48,946
You thought I was good?

713
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,981
You were great.

714
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,385
Well, should we go inside?

715
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:57,321
Yes, I would like that.

716
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,891
I will get you your own room.

717
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,360
It's okay. One will do.

718
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,463
Really?

719
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,032
Yes. One is fine.

720
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:11,235
[elevator dings]

721
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:20,478
* I've got the feeling *

722
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:23,681
* That you kinda maybe
sorta maybe want me, too *

723
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:28,686
* 'Cause we kick ass together *

724
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:31,489
* And I'm thinking you feel
the same way I do *

725
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,591
* Whoa

726
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:37,361
* I can almost see it
in your eyes, I think *

727
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:41,331
* And I think I know
what you're saying *

burnin' down below *

* Wah wah wah wah

731
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,941
* Tell me that you like that

732
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:55,913
* Do you honestly
possibly like that *

733
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,782
* Oh

734
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,351
* I can be your ninja boy

735
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,756
* And you should be
my ninja girl *

736
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:07,057
* There ain't nothing *

737
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,293
* Probably nothing

738
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:13,030
* That could come between us
in this whole world *

739
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:17,535
* Oh, I could be
your ninja man *

740
00:57:17,602 --> 00:57:21,472
* If I could figure out
just who I am *

741
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:23,040
* Incognito

742
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,275
* On the down low

743
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:30,715
* You'll never see me comin'
like I'll never see you comin' *

744
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:33,484
* My ninja girl

745
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:38,222
* My ninja girl

746
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,591
* My ninja girl

747
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,426
Um, Ikki?

748
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,795
* Na-na-na-na-ninja girl

749
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:48,833
Ikki, are you okay?

750
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,636
Yes, I am fine.

751
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,070
Come on.

752
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,592
Welcome.

753
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:18,028
Please follow instruction
very closely.

754
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:20,364
First, you must dim lights.

755
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,634
Very important to set mood
for happiness pleasure.

756
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:29,006
Then soft romantic music
for her ears' delight.

757

** [soft rock]

760
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:38,716
The flame of a candle will
show her that you burn for her.

761
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,685
Ow.

762
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:43,487
What can you find around you
that might smell good?

763
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:48,793
Fragrance is essential for
the happy lovemaking session.

764
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,234
Press menu for next lesson.

765
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,809
Are you coming out?

766
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,244
I'm going to meditate.

767
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,514
Good idea.

768
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:14,819
Maybe she's shy.

769
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:18,689
Maybe I should meet her
on the Plane of Enlightenment.

770
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:37,541
Nabu, I know you're there.

771
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:38,843
May I?

772
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:41,411
Thank you.

773
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,351
Kimi-san,
what's going on here?

774
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,720
Ikki, what are you doing here?

775
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,455
It is not important
what I'm doing here.

776
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,223
What is he doing here?

777
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,260
I thought you and me...

778
00:59:56,293 --> 01:00:00,731
W-Wait. You--
You're seeing him?

779
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:02,532
- Yes.
- No.

780
01:00:09,874 --> 01:00:11,241
Stop!

781
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,285
Stop, Nabu!

782
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,721
- Stop fighting!
- Let go!

783
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:27,224
[screams]

784
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,227

[music stops]

787
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,251
I'm sorry, Ikki,
if I misled you.

788
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,320
I'm sorry.

789
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:59,623
Um, I--
It was just a misunderstanding.

790
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,926
I-I gotta go.

791
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:06,196
Yeah.

792
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:14,138
Ikki, don't go.

793
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,940
I need to avenge
Sabu's death, Kimi-san.

794
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,708
I do not know
what I'm doing here.

795
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:21,211
I have a plan.
Let's go see LaDouche's enemy.

796
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:22,679
He will convince the police.

797
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:26,183
No, Kimi-san.
Sabu was wrong to send you.

798
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,885
It's my legend.

799
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,887
I'll be fine on my own.

800
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:38,863
Aah!

801
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:43,567
The Dancing Ninja
grows stronger.

802
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,037
Okay, I get it.

803
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:21,939
You're on a mission,

804
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,374
and you're a super good
ninja hider.

805
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:26,944
Whatever.

806
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,212
Who are you taking to?

807
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,947
Ninja girl.

808
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:32,116
What can I do for you, kid?

809
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:35,052
We share a common enemy.

810
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,787
LaDouche?

811
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:39,756
LaDouche.

812
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:41,758
He killed my Sabu.

813
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:43,027
Why come to me?

814
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,795
I'm from somewhere in Asia.

815
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,397
Who the hell's
gonna believe me?

816
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,466
Good point.

817
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,471
Whoa. You were a boxer?

818
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:58,876
I was a pretty good fighter
in my day.

819
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:05,315
Why, kid?

820
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,417
You fan of boxing?

821
01:03:58,202 --> 01:03:59,870
My father.

822
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,877
Wait, wait.

823
01:04:12,216 --> 01:04:13,717
Son.

824
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:14,651
Son.

825
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,853
- Son. Oh, my God.
- Daddy.

826
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,055
Son.

827
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,399
Daddy-san!

828
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,137
Daddy-san.

829
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:39,409
It was my fault
you were lost at sea.

830
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:41,979
I was on a fighting tour.

831
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,882
I thought a boat ride
and a massage...

832
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:51,588
It was only supposed to be
a three-hour tour.

833
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:55,092
Then the typhoon hit.

834
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:57,827
We searched for you, but...

835
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,563
[sighs]

836
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,832
I'm sorry, Ikki.

837
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:04,768
I failed you.

838
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:08,072
Daddy-san, to a ninja,

839
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:10,840
the past is only
a ripple in the pond.

840
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,777
You do not need
to blame yourself.

841
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:16,580
But crazy Ansel LaDouche?

842
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,016
Look, I don't want you
dealing with him.

843
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:22,219
He's one dangerous,
messed-up dude.

844
01:05:22,286 --> 01:05:24,921
Yes, he is.

845
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:29,026
But now we have each other,
and we can take him together.

846
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,427
Oh, son.

847
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,763
Now I have a Papa-san
and a Dad.

848
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,266
That sounds really good
to hear, Ikki.

849
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,368
It feels good to say.

850
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:39,903
Damn good, I bet.

851
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,806
- Hell, yeah! Damn good!
- [laughs]

852
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,154
You okay, Ikki?

853
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:58,655
Dancing Ninja?

854
01:05:58,755 --> 01:06:02,426
More like Dancing Nerd.
[laughs]

855
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,128
Put Jones in the car.

856
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,896
Get up! Get up!

857
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,599
You and LaDouche are
out of your freaking minds!

858
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,109
Okay.

859
01:06:21,845 --> 01:06:23,147
Mmm!

860
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,084
Hey!

861
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:36,126
LaDouche is gonna be sorry!
I can tell you that!

862
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:39,863
Here is how it's gonna go,
ninja girl.

863
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,266
When your dancing nerd friend
wakes up,

864
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,835
you can tell him
if he is a good little boy

865
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:48,772
and takes his ass
back to somewhere in Asia,

866
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:51,541
then after the premiere,

867
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:55,512
I will let his Papa go.

868
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:01,051
Good thing we bugged
his office, huh, Boss?

869
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:02,719
[engines start]

870
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:16,333
I owe this to you, buddy.

871
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,970
Where? Where can I find him?
I've looked everywhere.

872
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,873
Where am I
supposed to find him?

873
01:07:23,907 --> 01:07:28,145
What skill do I have?
You know what I mean?

874
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:31,515
I got punched by a girl.

875
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:34,151
That's just... lame.

876
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:39,723
You know what?
Maybe Sabu is right.

877
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,859
Maybe this legend
is just a fable.

878
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:47,864
I mean, I can't be
the Dancing Ninja.

879
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,603
Oh, hello.

880
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,084
Here.

881
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:09,286
You finish that.

882
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,921
I gotta check something out.

883
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:15,692
* Can't you see
it's slowly killing me *

884
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,462
* Your love is like poison

885
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:19,696
* Poison

886
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,865
* I should've let it go *

887
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,700
* But there's no antidote *

888
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,870
* Your love is like poison

889
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,306
* Poison

890
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:51,228
* Your love is like poison

891
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:52,262
* Poison

892
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:54,097
* I should've let it go *

893
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:56,132
* But there is no antidote

894
01:08:56,166 --> 01:08:58,835
* Your love is like poison

895
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,504
* Poison

896
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:04,107
* Can't you see
it's slowly killing me *

897
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:07,177
* Your love is like poison

898
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,245
* Poison

899
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,146
* I should've let it go *

900
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,115
* But there's no antidote *

901
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:15,252
* Your love is like poison

902
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:16,686
* Poison

903
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:19,656
**

904
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:25,695
* Your love is like a poison

905
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,198
* Gotta get your number

906
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:31,868
**

907
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:33,270
* Gotta get your number

908
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,872
* Your love is like a poison

909
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:45,815
[laughs]

910
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:50,387
So, tell me about your son.

911
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:51,988
There's nothing to tell.

912
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,857
There's nothing to tell,

913
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:55,959
other than he was lost at sea,

914
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,994
grew up somewhere in Asia,

915
01:09:58,061 --> 01:09:59,863
has the same Sabu as me,

916
01:09:59,896 --> 01:10:03,400
and now is here in America
to avenge his death.

917
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,635
Right.

918
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,004
Other than that...

919
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:10,907
Tell me something.

920
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:15,512
Is he the Dancing Ninja?

921
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:18,248
Did he look like
the Dancing Ninja back there?

922
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:21,518
I don't know. One minute,
he's an excellent fighter.

923
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:23,086
The next minute, he sucks!

924
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:25,322
I don't know
what to tell you, LaDouche!

925
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:31,661
How can I possibly trust you?

926
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:34,030
One minute we make a deal,

927
01:10:34,097 --> 01:10:37,033
and now you're
keeping secrets from me.

928
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:43,072
You know you're making me
do this, don't you?

929
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:44,941
Do what?

930
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,378
Dead!

931
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:49,579
Deader!

932
01:10:49,613 --> 01:10:52,015
Deadest!

933
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,521
When the premiere is over,

934
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,556
you'll have no choice
to make a deal with me

935
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:03,560
because every action star
in the world will be dead...

936
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:06,129
but moi.

937
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,564
Moi?

938
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:11,134
It's French for "me."

939
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,802
I don't speak French.

940
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,904
C'est la vie!

941
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,642
Who knew LA was so big?

942
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,445
I can't find him anywhere.

943
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:24,213
Oh, let me help.

944
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,131
Um...

945
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:45,569
I will change my clothes.

946
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:50,440
Right. I'll meditate.

947
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:53,510
Maybe I can find him
that way.

948
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,289
Damn it, Ikki, concentrate.

949
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:21,170
If you can't stop yourself
from being a peeping Tom-san,

950
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,608
you're never gonna find
your father. Focus.

951
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,464
What? What's the matter?

952
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,167
Kimi-san, you've asked me
to trust you,

953
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:54,037
and now I'm gonna have
to ask you to trust me.

954
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,906
Of course. What is it?

955
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,376
The only way that
I'll find my father

956
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:03,046
is if I become
the Dancing Ninja.

957
01:13:03,146 --> 01:13:09,185
Sabu said truth only comes
when you know a woman.

958
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,356
You know. So, um...

959
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:27,370
Should I?

960
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:47,423
Kimi-san, I can see my father!

961
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:49,926
Keep going.

962
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:03,406
I know where they are.
Let's go.

963
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:07,310
Oh.

964
01:14:16,486 --> 01:14:18,755
All set, Boss.

965
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,990
He's coming.

966
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,092
The Dancing Ninja
grows stronger.

967
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:25,261
Are you sure you're
just not being paranoid?

968
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,263
Why do you think
I'm being paranoid?

969
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,766
You keep saying, "The Dancing
Ninja grows stronger,"

970
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,234
like once an hour.

971
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,436
The Dancing Ninja
grows stronger.

972
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:36,072
The Dancing Ninja
grows stronger.

973
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:38,908
The Dancing Ninja
grows stronger.

974
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,144
Really?

975
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:43,913
I hadn't noticed.

976
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:45,515
Let's go.

977
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:49,185
Unbelievable.

978
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,121
Oh! And just for fun,

979
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,090
that's like the game Taboo.

980
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:56,826
You say the magic words
and boom!

981
01:14:56,926 --> 01:15:01,631
So I wouldn't try
and give away my plan away.

982
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:03,199
Words can--

983
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:05,535
- Ah, you--
- Get away from me.

984
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:10,807
Mm!

985
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,111
Bunch of morons.

986
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,947
[crowd cheering]

987
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,983
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

988
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:24,654
to the premiere of the one and
only 24-Hour Fighting Channel.

989
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:27,390
[cheering]

990
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,529
Let me introduce
our special guests tonight,

991
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:36,866
my good friends, Jet Li,
Jean Claude Van Damme,

992
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,570
and Mr. Steven Seagal,
ladies and gentlemen!

993
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,239
[cheering]

994
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,483
There.

995
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:10,934
Dad!

996
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,937
Don't say anything.
I'm booby trapped.

997
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,272
You say the wrong word, boom.

998
01:16:16,372 --> 01:16:17,707
- But...
- No!

999
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:19,442
- Well, let me--
- No, no! Don't touch anything.

1000
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,778
Don't say anything, Ikki.
Just listen to me.

1001
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,915
You have to stop... L...

1002
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:28,852
L?

1003
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,587
La...

1004
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:34,924
La... Oh! Uh...

1005
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:37,026
Yeah.

1006
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:40,463
Yeah, good.
Good, good, good.

1007
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:41,698
Yeah.

1008
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,971
- Right.
- Yeah!

1009
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:51,074
Tonight at the "blank."

1010
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,109
- The blank?
- I got this one.

1011
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,577
Okay.

1012
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:59,615
Come on. Yeah, yeah.

1013
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:03,653
- Yes!
- Wow!

1014
01:17:03,787 --> 01:17:05,454
You're really good
at this, Kimi.

1015
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:10,326
So, listen, tonight at the blank
of the Fighting Channel,

1016
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:13,562
there are bombs,
but not at the blank.

1017
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:17,500
At the get-together
after the blank.

1018
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,602
- The get-together?
- Yes.

1019
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:20,469
After the blank.

1020
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:22,638
Right, where the ac--

1021
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:31,080
Where the celebrities are.

1022
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:33,950
Ah! Ah, yes, yes, yes.
So, so...

1023
01:17:34,017 --> 01:17:34,984
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1024
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,352
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

1025
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:40,423
Is going to kill
the celebrities...

1026
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,860
at the get-together
after the...

1027
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,294
- Yes!
- Yes!

1028
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,530
Wow! This is fun!

1029
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,632
But we should probably go.

1030
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:51,801
Son, good luck.

1031
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:55,538
I wish I could
be there with you.

1032
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:57,273
- I love you--
- Don't touch me!

1033
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,476
Okay, okay.
I love you! Let's go.

1034
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,715
Man, I gotta pee.

1035
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,220
You should have listened,
Dancing Ninja.

1036
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:17,894
[laughs]

1037
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,013
They've got him.

1038
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,414
Fantastic!

1039
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:40,149
And the after-party?

1040
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,550
The timers are set.

1041
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,551
Perfect.

1042
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,653
And now, the name, the face,

1043
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,391
and the living soul
of the 24-Hour Fighting Channel,

1044
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:49,893
ladies and gentlemen...

1045
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:51,327
Go, LaDouche!

1046
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:55,698
...the ultimate
Ansel LaDouche!

1047
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:59,202
[cheering]

1048
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:01,604
Ohhh... hah!

1049
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:08,411
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

1050
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:11,781
And welcome to all
of our viewers at home.

1051
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:15,051
Don't forget
to log onto our website:

1052
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:17,954
www.betfight.com.

1053
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:21,524
And remember,
gamble responsibly.

1054
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:25,594
Tonight is a very
historical event,

1055
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:28,965
and I could give
a historical speech.

1056
01:19:29,065 --> 01:19:32,535
But it's not about me tonight,
unfortunately.

1057
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,771
It's about one thing.

1058
01:19:35,872 --> 01:19:38,041
One thing only.

1059
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,608
And what is that?

1060
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:40,376
Fight!

1061
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:41,610
What is that?

1062
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:42,445
Fight!

1063
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:45,648
All right, let's fight!

1064
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:46,883
Hyah!

1065
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:49,953
Come on, ladies!

1066
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,521
I can't move.

1067
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,124
But we have
to get out of here.

1068
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,326
How?

1069
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:33,997
You're ready, Ikki.
Remember what Sabu showed you.

1070
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:37,266
You must use your power
and your hips.

1071
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:41,204
I thought you were the ninja.

1072
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,106
I remember.

1073
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,541
[grunts]

1074
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:50,346
[sighs]
It's not working.

1075
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,115
Proceed at your own risk

1076
01:20:52,215 --> 01:20:55,551
when you face this feisty feline
in the pick chiffon.

1077
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:58,821
From Boca Raton,
Babette Bombeck.

1078
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,124
[cheering]

1079
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,893
And her opponent,

1080
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:07,730
from a trailer in Kentucky,
Denise Marie.

1081
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,798
Shut up!

1082
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,367
[booing]

1083
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,570
Shut up! Shut up!

1084
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,841
Shut up!

1085
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:31,654
It is no use.

1086
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:34,090
What are we gonna do?

1087
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,498
Fulfill the legend.

1088
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:45,068
I am ready, Ikki.

1089
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:55,411
* Oh, oh

1090
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,214
Ohh! Ah!

1091
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,116
No, no, no.

1092
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:03,219
Kimi-san, this is not right.

1093
01:22:03,286 --> 01:22:09,758
You do not burn for me
like I burn for you.

1094
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,128
I'll find another way.

1095
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:15,098
Wait, Ikki.

1096
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:17,933
I do burn for you.

1097
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:23,072
Ikki, it is you I want.

1098
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:28,544
* Don't let us go
Give me one more chance *

1099
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:32,115
* Before we crash and burn

1100
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:35,484
Ahh! Holy Shinto.

1101
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,553
* Before

1102
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,256
* Before we crash and burn

1103
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:41,624
* Mmm

1104
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:44,127
* Before we crash and burn

1105
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:45,161
Ow.

1106
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:47,896
[beeping]

1107
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:52,768
**

1108
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:54,637
My hand, my hand.

1109
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,806
[cheering]

1110
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,149
My hair, my hair.

1111
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:15,424
[screams]

1112
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,993
Ow. Sorry.

1113
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,136
[cheering]

1114
01:23:36,545 --> 01:23:39,115
Aaahhh... Unh!

1115
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:42,051
[gasps]

1116
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:49,125
That felt good.

1117
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:54,330
Really good.

1118
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:55,964
Yeah.

1119
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,233
Thanks.

1120
01:24:05,574 --> 01:24:07,310
Wait your turn.

1121
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,718
What's he doing here?
You said you had him.

1122
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:20,889
- We did.
- No, you didn't.

1123
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:22,525
- Yes, we did.
- No, you didn't.

1124
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:24,093
Yes, we did.
But now we don't.

1125
01:24:24,227 --> 01:24:26,061
Obviously, you didn't,
so go get him.

1126
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:29,332
Oh, my God! Steven Seagal!
Steve-o! You rock!

1127
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,567
Go say hi, guys.

1128
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:34,837
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

1129
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,573
There's got to be
a quicker way to the door.

1130
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:40,042
Get out of my way!

1131
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,079
Follow me.

1132
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:51,053
**

1133
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,967
Wow! It's Steven Seagal!

1134
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,969
You're my favorite action star.

1135
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:10,306
I loved you in that movie
Jonathan Livingston Seagal.

1136
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,708
Can I have your autograph?

1137
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:14,643
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you tonight.

1138
01:25:14,743 --> 01:25:17,413
Good to see you.
Good fights, huh? Okay.

1139
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,981
All the bombs in place?

1140
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:20,583
All but one.
It's still in the limo.

1141
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,050
Oh, well, that's nice,

1142
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,321
because obviously our goal here
is to blow up the limo!

1143
01:25:25,421 --> 01:25:26,622
It is?

1144
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,992
No, you idiot.
I'm being sarcastic.

1145
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:33,962
Okay, get the bomb out of
the limo. Bring it to me.

1146
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,333
Find Crystal. Bring her to me.
You think you can do that?

1147
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:38,834
No way.

1148
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,770
- What?
- I was being sarcastic, too.

1149
01:25:41,837 --> 01:25:43,639
Just do it! Do it!

1150
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:45,808
"I was sarcastic, too."

1151
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,118
Dance time, LaDouche.

1152
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:59,588
You can't stop me
and save the action stars.

1153
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:02,591
The bombs are in
the goodie bags.

1154
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,993
They're as good as dead.
[laughs]

1155
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:06,962
They go off
in less than a minute.

1156
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:11,334
Even the Dancing Ninja
can't be in two places at once.

1157
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:12,935
Make your choice.

1158
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,006
Bombs? Uh, would you
hold on a second?

1159
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:41,230
You mean these bombs
right here?

1160
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,398
I searched the building,

1161
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:44,833
and these were the only ones
I could find.

1162
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,068
They're yours, right?

1163
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,004
You'll kill us both,
you idiot!

1164
01:26:49,071 --> 01:26:51,240
Oh. Unh!

1165
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:57,746
Get 'em!

1166
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,391
**

1167
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:09,492
Hi-yah!

1168
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:36,852
Advanced mode.

1169
01:27:38,621 --> 01:27:40,889
I do not know who I am.

1170
01:27:40,956 --> 01:27:42,558
Finding your true self

1171
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:46,061
comes from the enlightenment
of knowing a woman.

1172
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,398
I've heard there is a legend.

1173
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:53,369
The ninjas of legend
are cold and hard,

1174
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:55,938
but the inside
burns like fire.

1175
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,940
Ikki, it's you.

1176
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,542
Is he the Dancing Ninja?

1177
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,243
- I have to be him.
- It's you.

1178
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,946
- I have to be him.
- It's you.

1179
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:07,450
The legend
of the Dancing Ninja.

1180
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,051
[echoes]

1181
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:19,328
[yells]

1182
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:20,563
Ikki, look out!

1183
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:46,855
Hello, ninja girl.
May I have this dance?

1184
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:56,432
Ikki, help!

1185
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:00,636
That's my girlfriend.

1186
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:10,646

1187
01:29:21,123 --> 01:29:23,959

1190
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,495
[gasps]
Ikki, the bomb!

1191
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:06,602
Oh! Ohh!

1192
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,606
[screaming]

1193
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,943
Oh...

1194
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:17,079
This is gonna hurt.

1195
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,455
[chuckles]

1196
01:30:31,694 --> 01:30:33,295
Now, where were we?

1197
01:30:34,697 --> 01:30:38,300
* Where you been
I waited so long *

1198
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:42,437
* Until today it's been
the same old song *

1199
01:30:42,538 --> 01:30:45,474
* I've been down
and I've been alone *

1200
01:30:45,574 --> 01:30:50,378
* Now there's something
I gotta know *

1201
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,815
* I'll never let you go *

1202
01:30:52,915 --> 01:30:57,753
** [continues]

1203
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:06,128
* Get up
This is good as it gets *

1204
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:16,939
* Oh

1205
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:21,009
* This is good as it gets

1206
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:23,979
* As good as it gets

1207
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:35,991
**

1208
01:31:36,024 --> 01:31:38,026
** [continues]

1209
01:33:56,064 --> 01:33:58,901
Do you LaDouche?

1210
01:34:03,939 --> 01:34:08,811
Somewhere in Asia,
a ninja was born.

1211
01:34:08,911 --> 01:34:11,146
But to dance or fight?

1212
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:13,315
He was torn.

1213
01:34:13,415 --> 01:34:16,151
* Dancing Ninja

1214
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,420
* Dancing Ninja

1215
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,322
* Dancing Ninja

1216
01:34:20,422 --> 01:34:21,990
* Oh, let's do it *

1217
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:24,426
* I play LaDouche
Don't miss my name *

1218
01:34:24,492 --> 01:34:27,029
* I'm the richest one
with the most fame *

1219
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,964
* You employ the martial arts

1220
01:34:29,031 --> 01:34:31,433
* It's hard to resist
my irresistible charm *

1221
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:33,635
* This crazy movie
will go far *

1222
01:34:33,702 --> 01:34:36,171
* With Lucas Grabeel
as the musical star *

1223
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:38,373
A Dancing Ninja?

1224
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:42,978
* Dancing Ninja

1225
01:34:43,045 --> 01:34:47,549
* Sweet and brave

1226
01:34:47,649 --> 01:34:52,154
* Dancing Ninja

1227
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:56,825
* Who will you save

1228
01:34:56,892 --> 01:34:57,960
Hey!

1229
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,028
* Korean Kimi was her name

1230
01:35:00,062 --> 01:35:02,497
* She's so hot
she'll drive you insane *

1231
01:35:02,564 --> 01:35:04,532
* Bree Turner
got legs for days *

1232
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:07,402
* She's so hot
she shook up her game *

1233
01:35:07,502 --> 01:35:09,805
* Gary Hudson, he's so cool *

1234
01:35:09,872 --> 01:35:12,207
* Be careful, though
He a dancing fool *

1235
01:35:12,307 --> 01:35:14,542
A Dancing Ninja?
A Dancing Ninja?

1236
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:16,711
A Dancing Ninja?
A Dancing Ninja?

1237
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:17,980
What the--

1238
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:20,983
A Dancing Ninja?

1239
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:25,387
* Dancing Ninja

1249
01:35:53,949 --> 01:35:56,919
* Patrick Gallagher as Sabu
brings chi to the film *

1250
01:35:57,019 --> 01:35:58,553
* I like Sabu

1251
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,789

* Move to the groove
dancing ninja style *

1255
