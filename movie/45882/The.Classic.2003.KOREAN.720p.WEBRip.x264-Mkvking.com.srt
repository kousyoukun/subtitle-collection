1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,790
When I was a child...

2
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,100
I remember seeing
[480p & 720p Movie Download | Mkvking.com]

3
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,370
a big rainbow over the river

4
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,910
Go away!
[480p & 720p Movie Download | Mkvking.com]

5
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,650
At that time my mother told me

6
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,820
"A rainbow is the door to heaven

7
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,700
When people die
they go to heaven through that door"

8
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,700
When I was a child
my father passed away

9
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,370
And my mother went abroad

10
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,900
I wanted my mom to remarry
but she didn't want to

11
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,580
My name is Ji-hae
and my blood type is O

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,920
And since I was seven
I learned taekwondo

13
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,440
Are you okay?

14
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,290
This box contains
my parents' letters and diaries

15
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,040
Every time my mother
read the letters, she wept

16
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,600
The refined letters and
the scent of the past...

17
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,980
My mom's first love is in here

18
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,960
Hello?

19
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,030
Ji-hae?
It's me, Soo-gyung

20
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,970
Why are you calling so early?

21
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,910
Wanna go to the art museum
and a play with me and Sang-min?

22
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey, are you making me tag along?

23
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,740
No, dummy! Sang-min
asked you to come

24
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,080
Really?

25
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,270
- I'm serious
- I got to know

26
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,420
Sang-min through Soo-gyung

27
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:05,030
She one day asked me
to write e-mails to Sang-min

28
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,700
For two months, I wrote
letters to him for Soo-gyung

29
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,490
Today, I saw you reading
a book by the bench

30
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,200
It looked like a picture
in a postcard

31
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,770
That's childish

32
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,000
Rewrite it?

33
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,810
No, I like it

34
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,080
I like it being childish

35
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,090
If you still want to marry

36
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,860
I'll give you a curse for a dowry

37
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,800
Sang-min, I sent you a letter
without missing a day

38
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,790
Afterwards, Soo-gyung
signed up for theater

39
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,310
So that she could get close to him

40
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
Good-bye
If you still want to marry

41
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,750
marry an idiot instead

42
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,950
The night stained with
pain kept me awake...

43
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,350
The gloomy moonlight has

44
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,330
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

45
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
on my window

46
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,790
No, that's not it!

47
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,130
The gloomy moonlight has

48
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,800
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

49
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,330
on my window

50
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,430
Jordan is touched
when Emily comes back to see him

51
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,840
You have to feel both
happy and heartbroken

52
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,810
Do it with more feeling!

53
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,920
When I look at him
I feel breathless

54
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,760
But he never
once looked at me

55
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,230
I'll put a spell on him

56
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,070
Look back! Look back!
Look back! Hey!

57
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,980
Music

58
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,150
When I saw you
for the first time

59
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,750
you already stole my heart

60
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,020
But now that
you came to me

61
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
I feel like we'll be together forever

62
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,890
Good

63
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,130
My heart is yours forever

64
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,540
He doesn't make
a lot of gesture

65
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,610
Isn't Sang-min fantastic?

66
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,970
I love guys who are into their work

67
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,240
Saw him?

68
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,640
"No, that's not it!"

69
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,150
The gloomy moonlight has

70
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,050
unexpectedly made
your shadow suspend

71
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,220
on my window

72
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,780
Talking about me?

73
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,990
It's nothing, Sang-min

74
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,750
You know Ji-hae, right?

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,730
She was with me
when I first came here

76
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,760
Right, it's been a while

77
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,400
Yes...
Hello

78
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,050
A lot of girls like him

79
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,320
Not just Soo-gyung

80
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,880
Even the woman working
at the student's hall likes him

81
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,650
Sung Joo-hee

82
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,460
Yoon Tae-soo

83
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,040
Oh Joon-ha?

84
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:09,100
"When I opened the window this morning
the romantic breeze signaled autumn coming

85
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,860
I'll put that wind
in the letter and send it to you"

86
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,670
Romantic breeze?

87
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,910
That's so cliché

88
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,280
I guess
I'll look at it as a classic

89
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,810
Oh Joon-ha!

90
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,790
Tae-soo came to me all of sudden
whom I've never talked to

91
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,520
Please write me a letter

92
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,890
He heard the rumor
that I write for others

93
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,340
Tae-soo is a friend who grew no less than
36 centimeters during the winter vacation

94
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,310
To who?

95
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,110
To my fiancée

96
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,280
Fiancée?

97
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,350
She's my dad's friend's daughter

98
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,690
They set us up on their own

99
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,050
You're lucky

100
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,820
You don't have to ask
girls out on dates

101
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,450
I'm sick of it

102
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm not the type to date one girl

103
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,490
If she mails me
he wants to check it

104
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,030
He wants to know everything

105
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,940
He acts just like a FBI agent

106
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,540
Oh no

107
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,780
She's pretty, huh?

108
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,850
But since she's a congressman's daughter
she'll be shallow

109
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,090
Drive! Drive!

110
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,070
You let them slip out
between your legs

111
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,240
City boys are slow

112
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Suwon isn't a city, Seoul is

113
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,570
Oh Suwon...
But we have a city hall

114
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,380
You catch them
and I'll draw them

115
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,880
Look carefully, idiot
Let's go

116
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,900
What are you doing?

117
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,470
She's Old SUNG's granddaughter
I heard she's from Suwon

118
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,440
- Wait, you're from Suwon, right?
- Yeah

119
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,180
We can never dream of having her
Old SUNG's son is a congressman

120
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,720
So she's a congressman's daughter

121
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,420
Then is she a congressman's son, idiot?

122
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,970
- Oh...
She's...

123
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,100
- She's waving
- Let's wave back!

124
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,440
Hey, wave!

125
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,770
- Hello!
- Hi!

126
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,210
I found one!

127
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,040
Let me see!

128
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,840
Let's see

129
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,580
It stinks

130
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,320
I got one

131
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,190
It's a big one

132
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,730
It sure ate a lot of cow shit

133
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,800
It's a beetle

134
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,540
A beetle?

135
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,410
But I've never seen one

136
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,540
Do you want this?

137
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,730
You wanna bet?

138
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,260
It's cow shit, it's dirty

139
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,780
Have you seen the haunted
house across the river?

140
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,750
What?

141
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,780
Yes

142
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,080
Can you take me there?

143
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,720
Yes

144
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,790
Do you know how to row?

145
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,290
Sure

146
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,600
Then let's meet at the ferry
at twelve tomorrow, okay?

147
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,080
- What did you say to her?
- She said something...

148
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,020
City boys are surely different

149
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,170
Hey, teach me how to row!

150
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,320
You'll teach me, right?

151
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,130
Grandpa told me a lot about it
but forbid me to go

152
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,130
It's strict where ever I go

153
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,410
I really wanted to go,
but I had no one to take me

154
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,310
If I ask the people here
then they'll tell my Grandpa right away

155
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:23,070
But the boat isn't moving

156
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,500
Gosh!

157
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,370
To be honest
this is my first time rowing

158
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,110
My name is Oh Joon-ha

159
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,890
Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself
I'm Sung Joo-hee

160
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,420
You're from Suwon?

161
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes

162
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,760
I'm from Suwon, too
I came here to visit my Uncle

163
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,970
Really?
What a coincidence

164
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,470
Or maybe fate?

165
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,110
- Pardon?
- Oh, nothing

166
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,140
Is there...
really a ghost?

167
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,630
Have you seen...
a ghost before?

168
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,720
Of course
Every day

169
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,990
What?

170
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,230
In the mirror

171
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,370
Actually, I'm a ghost

172
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,610
Stop it

173
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,210
- Are you okay?
- Yes

174
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,210
I think I sprained my ankle

175
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,540
Get on my back

176
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,320
Hurry and get on my back

177
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,620
It's a shower
It'll stop soon

178
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,500
Dry yourself with this

179
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,050
When the rain stops
we'll go along the river

180
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,920
Then we'll reach the ferry
Although it's a bit far

181
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,570
I'm heavy, huh?

182
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,840
Nope
You're not heavy at all

183
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,350
But I weigh a lot
And I eat a lot, too

184
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,250
Don't worry

185
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,490
I can carry you on my back
and go anywhere!

186
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,990
You're lying

187
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,180
I'm not lying

188
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,770
Yes, you are

189
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,320
No, I'm not

190
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,360
I caught it

191
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,080
Open your hands

192
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,580
Hold the firefly for a moment

193
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,630
You gave me a firefly
and carried me

194
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,050
But this is all that
I can give you in return

195
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,940
Please give me the firefly

196
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,520
Thanks for today

197
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,750
She was sick for a few days

198
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,850
and left for a big hospital in Seoul

199
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,020
After her mother died
she got really sick

200
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,290
But when she came back
from the countryside

201
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,390
I heard she got healthier
and looked happier

202
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,800
It's done

203
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,730
Let me see

204
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,240
It was painful to write
the letters for Tae-soo

205
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,720
Because of her

206
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,980
I had a lot to tell her myself

207
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,990
It's great

208
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,690
Can I thank you by showing
you my specialty?

209
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,860
Yes

210
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,740
Wait a sec
You have to open your mouth

211
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,770
When we close our mouths
people will think we faked it

212
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,750
Watch carefully

213
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,960
Know what song this is?

214
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,950
"Moonlight of Shilla"?

215
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,160
You punks!

216
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,860
Why haven't you finished your chores?

217
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:48,700
Are you bastards playing hooky?

218
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,270
I'll check later
so make it spotless!

219
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:56,710
And what's this smell?
Did someone take a shit here?

220
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,470
Joon-ha!

221
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,650
Oh Joon-ha!

222
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,210
Oh Joon-ha!

223
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,390
Joon-ha!
Oh Joon-ha!

224
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,920
Are you crazy to scream in a library?

225
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,390
Look, it's an invitation

226
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,170
Is everyone here Oh Joon-ha?

227
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,970
Nosey bastards

228
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,420
Thank you

229
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,930
Next is sophomore
Sung Joo-hee

230
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,990
She will play Beethoven's
Sonata 8 on the piano

231
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,730
Welcome with warm applause

232
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,050
Joo-hee, you must be hungry

233
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,110
I bet you're hungry

234
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,240
- Thank you
- Congratulations

235
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,480
Is your ankle better?

236
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,650
Yes

237
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,990
And your cold?

238
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,690
Yes

239
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,960
I was very worried about you

240
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,200
And I enjoyed your performance

241
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,530
I have to practice more

242
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,540
Everyone's waiting

243
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,980
I snuck out

244
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,020
I still have the firefly

245
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,730
It's in good health, like me

246
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,010
Hi

247
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,200
Sorry, I'm late

248
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,040
Mmm...

249
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,850
Hi, Ji-hae

250
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,220
Sang-min, I won
We made a bet

251
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,020
I bet you'd come
and Sang-min bet you wouldn't

252
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,950
You have to treat dinner

253
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,860
Okay, I will

254
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,070
What are you looking at?

255
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,020
I have to go

256
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,960
Why are you going so early?

257
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
Sang-min is treating us to dinner

258
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,400
Three's a crowd

259
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,390
You bad girl
You're too smart

260
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,700
Sang-min!
Ji-hae said she's leaving

261
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,280
But you should eat with us

262
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,850
And we can talk
about the play, too

263
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,720
Ji-hae never changes her mind

264
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,750
Right, Ji-hae?

265
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,870
Right

266
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,120
See?

267
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,780
That's too bad
It would've been nice if you came

268
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,530
Ever seen Sang-min treat
anyone like this?

269
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,260
He's doing this
because you're my friend

270
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,240
He's just being nice
so you can go, It's okay

271
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,280
Wait!

272
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,490
I bought presents today

273
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,930
I also got you one,
so you wouldn't feel alone

274
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:51,300
I bet you won't be able to sleep tonight
This isn't like Sang-min

275
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,240
It's because you're a good friend

276
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,440
If it wasn't for me
you'd never get this

277
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,080
Pick one

278
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,580
Ji-hae!

279
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,260
Ji-hae...

280
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,310
I like your present better

281
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,330
It's okay to switch, right?

282
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,860
Bye!

283
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,880
"When the sun shines
on the sea, I think of you

284
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,890
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you"

285
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,400
Really?
Is that what it says?

286
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,900
Gee!

287
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,230
Oh my gosh
Sang-min must really like me a lot

288
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,340
You have to give it
to me tomorrow, okay?

289
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,400
Okay

290
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,180
I have no reason to
see him anymore

291
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,710
He wants to be
with Soo-gyung now

292
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,810
When the sun shines
on the sea...

293
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,060
When the dim moonlight
is on the spring...

294
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,720
Are you done?

295
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,070
Wait a little longer

296
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,570
Hand in your manure

297
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,110
in an envelope after lunch

298
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,240
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

299
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,980
Those who didn't bring it
hurry and go take a shit!

300
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,880
Got it?

301
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,190
Let's get together!

302
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,300
One! Two!

303
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,620
One! Two!

304
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,690
One! Two!

305
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,730
Joon-ha

306
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,370
I'll close my eyes and run
so you guide me, okay?

307
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,680
I'm really closing them

308
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,110
Okay

309
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,610
Joon-ha

310
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,270
Wanna come with me to learn
the folk dance after class?

311
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,020
Folk?

312
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,990
I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there

313
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,290
It's my dad and his friend's idea

314
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,160
They want us to meet
at a healthy recreation

315
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,990
A lot of girls will be there
so you pick one up

316
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,500
- Gonna come, right?
- I don't know

317
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,730
Tae-soo!

318
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:35,210
Joo-hee, this is my friend Oh Joon-ha

319
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,820
She's the one
I told you about

320
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,090
I'm Oh Joon-ha
Nice to meet you

321
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:49,530
Hello
Are you two friends?

322
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,140
Know each other?

323
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,740
No, we don't

324
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,700
He's my best friend

325
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:10,760
This is my friend, Na-hee

326
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,390
Hi, I'm Na Na-hee

327
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,900
- I'm YOON Tae-soo
- I'm Oh Joon-ha

328
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,900
Everyone please have a seat

329
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,560
Come on!

330
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,030
Anywhere is fine

331
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,730
Today I will teach you the folk dance

332
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,820
- Sounds fun, right?
- Yes

333
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,920
Folk Dance is...

334
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,120
I missed you

335
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,500
Me, too

336
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,780
I didn't know
you were Tae-soo's friend

337
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,880
I want to be a woman anchor

338
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,920
So I always practice my speech

339
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,560
Can you do this?

340
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,750
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

341
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,390
Did I do okay?
I can do it faster

342
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,860
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

343
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,640
Shall I do it faster?

344
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,110
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

345
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,300
Give it a try

346
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:56,440
Peter Piper a pecked
of peppers pickled...

347
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,990
You'll need a lot of practice
Repeat precisely after me

348
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:08,390
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers

349
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,830
We should split up now

350
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,970
I'll take Joo-hee home
so you take care of Na-hee

351
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,240
Okay?
See you later

352
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,540
I had fun
Good night

353
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,640
Bye, Joo-hee

354
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,810
Good night

355
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,270
What are you doing?
Let's get going

356
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,350
Joon-ha

357
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,210
then try something easier

358
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,720
Try this

359
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,220
She sells seashells by the seashore

360
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,060
Easy, huh?
Give it a try

361
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,300
Pardon?

362
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,230
I said give it a try

363
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,030
Give what a try?

364
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,280
She sells seashells
by the seashore

365
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,710
Give this a try

366
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,340
I can't
Please don't ask me to

367
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,010
You can't do this?

368
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,390
She sells seashells
by the seashore

369
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,720
It's easy

370
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,390
She sells seashells
by the seashore

371
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,150
- Have a good...
- Yes...

372
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,080
Good-bye

373
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,170
The card

374
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,850
I should've known
there'd be a card for me

375
00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,180
Ji-hae?

376
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,180
Oh, hello

377
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,260
Where are you headed?

378
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,060
To the library

379
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,770
That far?

380
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:21,570
It's not far

381
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:26,040
I won't get so wet
if I stop at each building

382
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,590
Then I'll take you there

383
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,550
With my special umbrella

384
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,630
Think of that building
as a shed and run

385
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,470
One, Two, Three!

386
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:40,110
How are you?

387
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,220
Thanks so much

388
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,650
But you're soaked

389
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,090
I was going to
get wet anyway

390
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,600
I should be going
Thanks again

391
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,870
- Okay, I'll see you later
- OK!

392
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,920
I didn't think
we'd meet again

393
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,900
But why does the library
have to be so close?

394
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:02,950
She hasn't mailed me back yet

395
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,360
- Joo-hee?
- Yeah

396
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,910
- Why not?
- I don't know

397
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,980
I'm not the type
to fall in love with one girl

398
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,680
But I must really like her

399
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,710
Tae-soo!

400
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,750
Tae-soo!

401
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,890
Tae-soo?

402
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,690
Hi

403
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,400
What are you doing here?

404
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:45,500
I was waiting for you

405
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,640
Please take these flowers

406
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:57,020
I like you, Joo-hee

407
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,180
Please write to me

408
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,430
It's so strange
Is it because I'm too tall?

409
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,640
Why do I keep fainting?

410
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,750
I'm out of breath

411
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,790
It's because of Tae-soo, right?

412
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,060
What do you think
I should do?

413
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,160
Tell me

414
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,740
Tae-soo is a rotten bastard

415
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,240
No, Tae-soo is nice

416
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:41,420
He's a rotten bastard
because he's too nice

417
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:48,630
Tae-soo is waiting for your letter

418
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,760
There's no hope

419
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,940
There's nothing
we can do for us

420
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:07,240
Don't say that

421
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,210
There's a way

422
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,480
No, there's nothing more we can do

423
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,390
Nothing

424
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,760
We'll only get hurt

425
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,340
It'll work out

426
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:52,050
I won't see neither you
nor Tae-soo anymore

427
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,880
I'm serious

428
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,690
I won't see anyone

429
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,620
Hey, limousine boy!

430
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,430
Come here

431
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:33,060
Limousine boy!
Forgot to bow?

432
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,500
So you don't wanna bow
is that it?

433
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:44,270
If you have a chauffeur
you don't have to bow, huh?

434
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,980
Your badge is upside down
and your shirt's unbuttoned

435
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,550
Fine, today I'll give you
the worst beating ever

436
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,320
I'm gonna beat you
all starting from the left

437
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,960
The first one gets hit once
the second one gets hit twice

438
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,070
From the third
shout out your turn

439
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:15,940
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

440
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:19,540
- You sissies, I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

441
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,510
Seven

442
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,940
Stay still!

443
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,150
- Ouch, my back
- Stay still, or I'll break your arm

444
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:48,800
You get one more beating
Get into position!

445
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,900
Listen to what I said
and get into position!

446
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,350
What's the count?

447
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,350
I said what's the count?

448
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:09,850
Then I'll tell you
You're nineteen

449
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,260
One

450
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,800
Two

451
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,290
Three!

452
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,630
Hey, get up!
Get up!

453
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,090
Hey, Hey!
What's wrong with you?

454
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,350
It's about Joo-hee

455
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,260
I don't think she likes me

456
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,720
I gave her flowers
and even kissed her

457
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:45,760
but there's no response

458
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,900
You kissed her?

459
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,170
Yeah

460
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,010
When the sun shines on the sea
I think of you

461
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:06,410
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you

462
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:53,760
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

463
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,520
Dummy

464
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,230
Do you want to get electrocuted?

465
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,160
You're crazy

466
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,060
I don't want to split up like this

467
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,630
Let's talk just for a moment

468
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,040
Nothing can change

469
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,340
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

470
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,760
Here's your letter

471
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:47,700
I don't want it anymore

472
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,230
Why?

473
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:53,280
There's no response
and because of my conscience

474
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,010
I'll write it myself from now on

475
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,510
And tell her the truth

476
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,650
It's a golden opportunity

477
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:06,920
I heard she's very sick from the rain

478
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:10,590
So she's in the hospital

479
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,430
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

480
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:16,030
Yeah

481
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,160
I'm going to see her

482
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:23,570
If I visit her when she's sick
then I can score

483
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:29,380
I'll confess to her that
I didn't write the letters

484
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,280
I won't tell her
it was you

485
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:37,120
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

486
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:41,330
but I really like her

487
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,490
Oh Joon-ha!

488
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:45,690
Oh Joon-ha!

489
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,400
He's calling you

490
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:48,570
Yes?

491
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,770
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

492
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,940
I have to eat all this?

493
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:58,380
Look at this

494
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:02,250
Maw worms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

495
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,550
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

496
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,590
Because of you
our class has the most parasites

497
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:11,090
But sir
it wasn't my manure

498
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,790
Then whose was it?

499
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:17,960
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

500
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,680
YOON Tae-soo

501
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,410
Eat three

502
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,090
But it's the same manure

503
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:48,890
Yeah, but some spots have
more parasites and some don't

504
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,210
How'd you know
I was here?

505
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,320
Why are you covering your face?

506
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:17,320
Stop it, I haven't washed
my face, and it's dirty

507
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,950
But you're still pretty

508
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,290
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

509
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,360
Why are you laughing?

510
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,670
I heard you ate
32 worm-killing pills

511
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:36,310
Tae-soo, that bastard
has a big mouth

512
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,470
Did he say anything else?

513
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:54,950
After being silent for a while
that's all he said and left

514
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,420
- Really?
- Yeah

515
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,130
He's so odd

516
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:06,460
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

517
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,680
I'm sorry

518
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,210
I must be really stupid

519
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:20,920
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

520
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,180
No, there's a lot
you're good at

521
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,490
Like getting drenched
and eating worm pills

522
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:35,630
Don't laugh
This is serious

523
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,500
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

524
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:46,310
Then we can clear our conscience

525
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,230
See you later

526
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:52,710
Is this her room?

527
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:02,420
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

528
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,260
No, lie down

529
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:11,500
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

530
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:14,010
So, are you eating well?

531
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,740
You should eat well to recover

532
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:26,180
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

533
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,300
Wrong room

534
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,010
Clench your fists

535
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,120
Raise them like this

536
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,570
Now hit me

537
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,850
Why should I hit you?

538
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,030
Hurry and hit me!

539
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:22,570
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

540
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,280
My dad hit me too many times

541
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,940
I like Joo-hee

542
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,640
Actually, she gave me
this necklace last summer

543
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,180
Are you okay?

544
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:41,180
Damn it
I've fallen again

545
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,720
Don't worry

546
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:50,600
And don't let my dad
see that necklace

547
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,670
He'll get furious

548
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,040
That necklace was
a gift from my dad

549
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:01,010
To Joo-hee

550
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:11,480
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

551
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:15,320
Later on, we went
on school break

552
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:20,730
And I thought
I couldn't see her again

553
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,630
I miss you

554
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:26,060
I miss you so much I'll die

555
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:31,270
And I'm curious how much
our river has changed

556
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:38,370
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

557
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,980
Say that I miss them
and that I'm doing okay

558
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,890
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to
me with your Uncle's address

559
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,930
He also confessed
a shocking thing to me

560
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,290
That you were the one
who wrote the letters to me

561
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,840
How could you
hide that from me?

562
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,810
Anyway, it's okay

563
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:12,020
I almost threw away
those letters

564
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,280
but now I can read them again
and think of you

565
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,190
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

566
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:25,590
That you put Tae-soo's name
on the letters you send me

567
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:31,290
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

568
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,840
Look outside the window

569
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,840
If the branches swing
gently in the wind

570
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:43,610
then the one
you love is loving you, too

571
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,790
Right now
it's snowing outside

572
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,090
When it first snows

573
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,490
they say you should
stroll with your beloved

574
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:57,360
But I'm just writing a letter

575
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,990
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

576
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,190
I'm going to get permission
to go to Grandpa's house

577
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,470
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

578
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,510
Open your ears

579
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,910
If you hear your heartbeat

580
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:18,610
then the person
you love is loving you, too

581
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,580
Close your eyes

582
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,120
If there's a smile
on your lips

583
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:27,960
then the person
you love is loving you, too

584
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,980
I want to send a telegraph

585
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,420
Then please sign up here

586
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,820
Okay

587
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:11,270
But fate must not be on my side

588
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,570
One of my letters

589
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,170
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

590
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,500
Joo-hee is
in love with Joon-ha

591
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:27,580
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

592
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:34,950
Both of them really
love each other

593
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,990
So that's why I gave up

594
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,560
Two people in love
should be together

595
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,670
It's okay with me

596
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,840
No, I love her, too

597
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:56,580
I won't give up

598
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:04,720
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

599
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:12,260
So your parents mean nothing to you?

600
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:17,130
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

601
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,370
Know what that means, you punk?

602
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,240
You deserve to die

603
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,010
You can't even hold on to a girl

604
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,090
It was the end of a winter break?

605
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,930
I had hoped so much for

606
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:19,800
Know what this is?

607
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,430
A belt?

608
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:25,960
No, it's a whip

609
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,600
This bastard hits me

610
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:34,280
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

611
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:43,350
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

612
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,720
The death penalty

613
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:50,960
That's exactly what I thought

614
01:21:56,670 --> 01:22:00,370
Kill it slowly and painfully?

615
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:07,540
Or starve it slowly to death?

616
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,620
Or give it sleeping pills?

617
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:13,520
Strangle it to death

618
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,750
Good idea

619
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,560
Joon-ha

620
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:32,670
Take good care of Joo-hee

621
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,750
Tae-soo!

622
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:58,920
Somebody help!

623
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:02,220
A person's dying!

624
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,330
Tae-soo, you bastard!

625
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,860
Tae-soo, you bastard!

626
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,570
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

627
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:13,770
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

628
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:17,610
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

629
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:25,040
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

630
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:30,750
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

631
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:39,060
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

632
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:43,220
Breathe! Breathe!

633
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:47,300
Breathe, you bastard!

634
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:40,920
Go inside

635
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:57,510
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

636
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:05,110
Hurry

637
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,330
Wait here for me

638
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:52,090
Hurry and get well

639
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,030
Ji-hae, know what this is?

640
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:48,600
An umbrella?

641
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:51,760
A very special umbrella

642
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:54,200
They're all the same

643
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:00,150
It's special because
Sang-min gave it to me

644
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:04,760
He must know that I like him

645
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:09,780
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

646
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,130
Go give this to Sang-min

647
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,900
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

648
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,460
Why not?

649
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,440
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

650
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:27,910
Remember when it
suddenly rained that day?

651
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:32,110
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

652
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,950
He was looking out of the window

653
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,760
then suddenly turned to me and said

654
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:47,900
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

655
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:53,140
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

656
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:59,240
He placed his umbrella here

657
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:03,470
and said
"You can have it"

658
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,750
He said he was okay to get wet

659
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,820
And then he ran off in the rain

660
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:22,760
Did you bring an umbrella?

661
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:30,410
You can have it.

662
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:40,150
It's raining a lot outside

663
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:44,880
Sang-min might be getting soaked
without an umbrella

664
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:06,280
This is a really special umbrella

665
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:11,450
I'll give it back to him

666
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:21,350
Did you bring an umbrella?

667
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:23,160
Of course, I did

668
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,590
Really?

669
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,890
But still, take mine

670
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:34,800
Is she crazy?

671
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:57,480
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

672
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:02,280
It's not mine

673
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:04,960
I came to return it to you

674
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:08,330
You left it at the store

675
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:17,530
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

676
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,350
Don't go

677
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,060
You already know...

678
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,690
my feelings

679
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,600
Now, you know it all

680
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:55,070
Yeah

681
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,280
when I saw you run
without an umbrella

682
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:04,720
I left my umbrella behind

683
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:11,320
Even on the day of the play

684
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:18,760
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

685
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:23,940
And if fate was on my side

686
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:29,980
I thought you'd pick
the gift with the card in it

687
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,750
I thought we'd grow distant

688
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:38,480
if I confessed my feelings

689
01:35:38,590 --> 01:35:43,290
I wanted to say
that I liked you, but I couldn't

690
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:47,830
I'll come see the play

691
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,710
Look
I cut my wrists

692
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:08,010
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

693
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:10,690
Do you really love her?

694
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:12,790
Is it really so?

695
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:15,020
I'm working out my feelings

696
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:18,860
My eyes were looking straight

697
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,020
but my heart was confused

698
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:24,260
Can I trust those words?

699
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:28,300
Can I think of it as a promise?

700
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:31,170
Yes

701
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,680
There's only one that I love

702
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:39,480
That one is me, right?

703
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,080
Yes, I love you

704
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:43,150
I swear that I love you

705
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,690
I love you, too

706
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,730
Sang-min
I love you so much

707
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,160
Sang-min!

708
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:11,780
What the hell are you doing?

709
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:15,250
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

710
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,060
You can’t just change
your lines like that

711
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:18,620
You ruined everything!

712
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:21,430
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

713
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:24,200
I love you
Love is more important than a play

714
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:25,360
I love you

715
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:57,260
After the play
Sang-min and I went on a date

716
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,560
We decided to go to the river

717
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:05,030
where my mother's memories lay

718
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:14,840
Joo-hee?

719
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:22,350
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

720
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:24,220
Is that so?

721
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:26,610
I must've made a mistake

722
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:30,050
But you look so much like your mom

723
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:35,830
I delivered a lot of
your mom's letters

724
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:37,130
Thank you, sir

725
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:03,420
I know well what happened to
my parents afterwards

726
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,600
Students and citizens!

727
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,840
This is illegal demonstrations!

728
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:18,780
Eliminate corruption
and establish a new state! A new state!

729
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:21,080
Down with dictatorship
and the military regime!

730
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:23,340
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

731
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,720
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

732
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:11,520
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

733
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:14,520
Put on toothpaste

734
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,130
It's been a long time

735
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,970
It has

736
01:40:56,940 --> 01:41:03,370
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

737
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,160
Joon-ha!

738
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:28,960
Joon-ha!

739
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,800
Joon-ha!

740
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:42,210
Joon-ha!

741
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:44,410
Joon-ha!

742
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,250
Joon-ha!

743
01:42:56,730 --> 01:43:01,690
Joon-ha
come back alive!

744
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:09,970
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

745
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:12,200
Joon-ha!

746
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,210
Joon-ha
answer me!

747
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:19,180
Joon-ha!

748
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:30,660
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

749
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:37,900
Joon-ha
come back alive!

750
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,000
Joon-ha!

751
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,110
Joon-ha!

752
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:55,780
Joon-ha!

753
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,820
Joon-ha!

754
01:43:59,490 --> 01:44:00,890
Joon-ha!

755
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:04,060
Joon-ha!

756
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,390
Joon-ha!

757
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:11,700
Joo-hee!

758
01:44:18,510 --> 01:44:20,740
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

759
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:24,720
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

760
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:25,770
Tae-soo!

761
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,310
Joon-ha!

762
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,180
Joon-ha!

763
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,630
Joon-ha!

764
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:44,000
You have to come back alive!

765
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,590
Joon-ha!

766
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,730
Joon-ha
come back alive!

767
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:53,400
You have to come back alive!

768
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:56,470
Got it?

769
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,930
Medic! Medic!

770
01:46:57,570 --> 01:47:00,770
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

771
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,870
Stop it!

772
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,740
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

773
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,470
Joon-ha, you bastard!

774
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:14,780
Where are you going?

775
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,240
Come back!
Corporal OH!

776
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:28,430
You haven't changed at all

777
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,890
Just like in the past

778
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,160
you're still pretty

779
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:42,810
I've aged a lot

780
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:59,620
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

781
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:10,960
How's Tae-soo doing?

782
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:16,680
I guess he's doing alright

783
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:31,120
Why didn't you get married?

784
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:40,330
Well, I did

785
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:52,010
I heard

786
01:53:57,550 --> 01:54:00,350
I had so much to tell you

787
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:06,050
But now that we've met
I can't remember

788
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:24,000
It's a piano doll

789
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:26,810
We have one
at my home, too

790
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:34,860
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

791
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:45,300
It looks so much like you back then

792
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:48,430
Doesn't it?

793
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:06,780
We were so innocent back then

794
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:09,850
But the past has gone now

795
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:16,430
I think our feelings
took the best of us

796
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:21,830
We cried and laughed
at the smallest things

797
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:54,800
How do I look right now?

798
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:59,570
You look healthy

799
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:07,980
But I'd like to see
you look happier

800
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:19,500
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

801
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:32,440
Why did you hide that
you couldn't see?

802
01:56:43,090 --> 01:56:44,950
It's late

803
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:47,750
Sorry, I have an appointment

804
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,020
I have to go

805
01:57:43,150 --> 01:57:44,840
I'm sorry

806
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:50,110
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

807
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:56,120
I even came here
last night to practice

808
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,350
You almost fooled me

809
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:09,000
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

810
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:12,200
Also...

811
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:22,240
I risked my life to return
this necklace to you

812
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:32,590
Please don't

813
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:38,730
This necklace is yours

814
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:45,630
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

815
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:51,300
Then a few years later...

816
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:30,950
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

817
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:42,720
Joon-ha's last wish

818
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:52,260
was for you to spread
his dust in this river

819
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:58,540
Actually

820
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:01,440
Joon-ha

821
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,150
got married right
after you did

822
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:17,390
Poor guy had a son, too

823
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:45,950
And Joon-ha

824
02:01:46,220 --> 02:01:49,820
wanted you to have this

825
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,920
Mommy, it's a rainbow

826
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:05,260
I still remember clearly
the rainbow I saw that day

827
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:09,860
Until I finished telling this story

828
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:13,050
Open your hands
