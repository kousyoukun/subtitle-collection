THE CLASSIC

4
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,892
starring Son Ye-jin

5
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,737
Cho Seung-woo

6
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,745
and Cho In-sung

7
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,857
produced by Ji Young-joon

00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,326
written & directed by Kwak Jae-yong

9
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:35,687
When I was a child,

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,417
I remember seeing
a big rainbow over the river.

11
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,895
Go away!

12
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,072
At that time my mother told me,

13
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,246
"A rainbow is the door to heaven.

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:09,013
When people die,
they go to heaven through that door."

15
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,255
When I was a child,
my father passed away.

16
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,916
And my mother went abroad.

17
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,965
I wanted my mom to remarry,
but she didn't want to.

18
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,232
My name is Ji-hyae,
and my blood type is O.

19
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,342
And since I was seven,
I learned taekwondo.

20
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,557
Are you okay?

21
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,422
This box contains my
parents' letters and diaries.

22
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:23,389
Every time my mother
read the letters, she wept.

23
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:28,927
The refined letters
and the scent of the past...

24
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,865
My mom's first love is in here.

25
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,941
Hello?

26
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,018
Ji-hyae?

27
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,815
It's me, Soo-gyung.

28
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,821
Why are you calling so early?

29
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,425
Wanna go to the art museum
and a play with me and Sang-min?

30
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,565
Hey, are you
making me tag along?

31
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,358
No, dummy.

32
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,365
Sang-min asked you to come.

33
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,729
Really?

34
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,136
I'm serious.

35
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,276
I got to know Sang-min
through Soo-gyung.

36
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:50,374
She one day asked me
to write e-mails to Sang-min.

37
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,580
For two months,
I wrote letters to him for Soo-gyung.

38
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,224
Today, I saw you
reading a book by the bench.

39
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,451
It looked like a picture
in a postcard.

40
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,231
That's childish.

41
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,533
Rewrite it?

42
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,105
No, I like it.

43
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,399
I like it being childish.

44
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,512
If you still want to marry,

45
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,205
I'll give you a curse for a dowry.

46
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,955
Sang-min, I sent you a letter
without missing a day.

47
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,423
Afterwards,
Soo-gyung signed up for theater.

48
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,789
Go to the convent! Go!

49
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:39,963
Good-bye.

50
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,330
If you still want to marry,
marry an idiot instead.

51
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:47,595
The night stained with pain
kept me awake...

52
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,166
The gloomy moonlight

53
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,877
has unexpectedly made your shadow
suspend on my window.

54
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,072
No, that's not it!

55
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,751
The gloomy moonlight

56
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,946
has unexpectedly made your shadow
suspend on my window.

57
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,993
Jordan is touched
when Emily comes back to see him.

58
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,393
You have to feel both
happy and heartbroken.

59
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,095
Do it with more feeling!

60
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,274
When I look at him,
I feel breathless.

61
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,941
But he never once looked at me.

62
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,676
I'll put a spell on him.

63
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,147
Look back.

64
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,189
Look back! Look back! Hey!

65
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,664
Music.

66
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,164
When I saw you for the first time,

67
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,971
you already stole my heart.

68
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,914
But now that you came to me,

69
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,980
I feel like we'll be together forever.

70
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,346
Good.

71
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,713
My heart is yours forever.

72
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,084
Isn't Sang-min fantastic?

73
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,729
I love guys who are into their work.

74
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,895
Saw him?

75
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,657
"No, that's not it!"

76
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,200
"The gloomy moonlight

77
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:31,605
has unexpectedly made your shadow
suspend on my window."

78
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,304
Talking about me?

79
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,345
It's nothing, Sang-min.

80
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,310
You know Ji-hyae, right?

81
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,181
She was with me
when I first came here.

82
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,189
Right, it's been a while.

83
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,255
Yes...

84
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,896
Hello.

85
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,430
A lot of girls like him.

86
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,695
Not just Soo-gyung.

87
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:04,407
Even the woman working
at the student's hall likes him.

88
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,506
Sung Joo-hee.

89
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,283
Yoon Tae-soo.

90
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,223
Oh Joon-ha?

91
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,746
"When I opened the window this morning,

92
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,716
the romantic breeze
signaled autumn coming.

93
00:10:55,087 --> 00:11:00,252
I'll put that wind in the letter
and send it to you."

94
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,318
Romantic breeze?

95
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,057
That's so cliche.

96
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,629
I guess I'll look at it as a classic.

97
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,236
Oh Joon-ha!

98
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,711
Tae-soo had never spoken to me before,

99
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,176
but one day he came to me.

100
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,984
Write me a letter.

101
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,478
He heard that
I wrote letters for my friends.

102
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,755
They said that Tae-soo
grew a foot over winter break.

103
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,418
To who?

104
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,694
To my fiancee.

105
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,499
Fiancee?

106
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,630
She's my dad's friend's daughter.

107
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,167
They set us up on their own.

108
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,742
You're lucky.

109
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,469
You don't have
to ask girls out on dates.

110
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,244
I'm sick of it.

111
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,980
I'm not the type to date one girl.

112
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,019
If she mails me,
he wants to check it.

113
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,482
He wants to know everything.

114
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,218
He acts just like a FBI agent.

115
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,189
Oh no.

116
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,136
She's pretty, huh?

117
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:32,140
But since she's a congressman's
daughter, she'll be shallow.

118
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,487
You let them slip out
between your legs.

119
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,595
City boys are slow.

120
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,288
Suwon isn't a city, Seoul is.

121
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,059
But we have a city hall.

122
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,260
You catch them,
and I'll draw them.

123
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,269
Look carefully, idiot.

124
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,734
Let's go.

125
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,980
What are you doing?

126
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,924
She's Old Sung's granddaughter.

127
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,892
I heard she's from Suwon.

128
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,298
Wait, you're from Suwon, right?

129
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,558
Yeah.

130
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,299
We can never dream of having her.

131
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,837
Old Sung's son is a congressman.

132
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,499
So she's a congressman's daughter.

133
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,076
Then is she a congressman's son,
idiot?

134
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,417
She's waving.

135
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,057
- Let's wave back!
- Hey, wave!

136
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,659
Hello!

137
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,023
I found one!

138
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,594
Let me see!

139
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,194
Let's see.

140
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,165
It stinks.

141
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,742
I got one.

142
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,411
It's a big one.

143
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,475
It sure ate a lot of cow shit.

144
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,458
It's a beetle.

145
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,589
A beetle?

146
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,894
But I've never seen one.

147
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,970
Do you want this?

148
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,488
It's cow shit, it's dirty.

149
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,328
Have you seen the haunted house
across the river?

150
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,763
What?

151
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,903
Yes.

152
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,231
Can you take me there?

153
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,838
Yes.

154
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,503
Do you know how to row?

155
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,647
Sure.

156
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:30,152
Then let's meet at the ferry
at twelve tomorrow, okay?

157
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,566
What did you say to her?

158
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,671
City boys are surely different.

159
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,969
Hey, teach me how to row!

160
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,509
You'll teach me, right?

161
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,453
Grandpa told me a lot about it,
but forbid me to go.

162
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,552
It's strict where ever I go.

163
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,691
I really wanted to go,
but I had no one to take me.

164
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,463
If I ask the people here,

165
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,733
then they'll tell
my Grandpa right away.

166
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:09,219
But the boat isn't moving.

167
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,654
To be honest,

168
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,025
this is my first time rowing.

169
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,903
My name is Oh Joon-ha.

170
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,577
Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself.

171
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,408
I'm Sung Joo-hee.

172
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,975
You're from Suwon?

173
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,141
Yes.

174
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,014
I'm from Suwon, too.

175
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,186
I came here to visit my Uncle.

176
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,654
Really?

177
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,319
What a coincidence.

178
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,794
Or maybe fate?

179
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,361
Pardon?

180
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,760
Oh, nothing.

181
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,598
Is there really a ghost?

182
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,205
Have you seen a ghost before?

183
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,848
Of course.

184
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,345
Every day.

185
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,849
What?

186
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,713
In the mirror.

187
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:59,853
Actually, I'm a ghost.

188
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,829
Stop it.

189
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,553
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

190
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,896
I think I sprained my ankle.

191
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,599
Get on my back.

192
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,002
Hurry and get on my back.

193
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,437
It's a shower.

194
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,110
It'll stop soon.

195
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,014
Dry yourself with this.

196
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,671
When the rain stops,
we'll go along the river.

197
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,467
Then we'll reach the ferry.

198
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,512
Although it's a bit far.

199
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,399
I'm heavy, huh?

200
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,829
Nope.

201
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,593
You're not heavy at all.

202
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,939
But I weigh a lot.

203
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,335
And I eat a lot, too.

204
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,973
Don't worry.

205
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:15,306
You're so light I can carry you
all the way to Seoul.

206
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,742
You're lying.

207
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,040
I'm not lying.

208
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,411
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

209
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,990
I caught it.

210
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,096
Open your hands.

211
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:19,098
Hold the firefly for a moment.

212
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,073
You gave me a firefly
and carried me.

213
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:35,142
But this is all that
I can give you in return.

214
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,062
Please give me the firefly.

215
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,402
Thanks for today.

216
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,765
She was sick for a few days,

217
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,409
and left for
a big hospital in Seoul.

218
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,607
After her mother died,
she got really sick.

219
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,441
But when she came back
from the countryside,

220
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,884
I heard she got healthier
and looked happier.

221
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,348
It's done.

222
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,452
Let me see.

223
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,331
It was painful to write
the letters for Tae-soo.

224
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,433
Because of her.

225
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:46,670
I had a lot to tell her myself.

226
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,341
It's great.

227
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,346
Can I thank you by
showing you my specialty?

228
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,145
Sure.

229
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,723
Wait a sec.

230
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,288
You have to open your mouth.

231
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,022
When we close our mouths,
people will think we faked it.

232
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,059
Watch carefully.

233
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,737
Know what song this is?

234
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,576
"Moonlight of Shilla?"

235
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,041
You punks!

236
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,449
Why haven't you
finished your chores?

237
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,285
Are you bastards playing hookie?

238
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,991
I'll check later,
so make it spotless!

239
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,018
And what's this smell?

240
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,458
Did someone take a shit here?

241
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:43,766
Joon-ha!

242
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,503
Oh Joon-ha!

243
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,536
Oh Joon-ha!

244
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,941
Joon-ha! Oh Joon-ah!

245
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,146
Are you crazy to scream in a library?

246
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,842
Look, it's an invitation.

247
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,384
Is everyone here Oh Joon-ha?

248
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,420
Nosey bastards.

249
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,755
Thank you.

250
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:03,709
Next is sophomore, Sung Joo-hee.

251
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:08,750
She will play Beethoven's
Sonata 8 on the piano.

252
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,718
Please give her a round of applause.

253
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,636
Joo-hee, you must be hungry.

254
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,398
I bet you're hungry.

255
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,938
I'll treat my daughter-in-law
to a nice meal.

256
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,510
Let's go.

257
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,091
Thank you.

258
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,734
Congratulations.

259
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,031
Is your ankle better?

260
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,242
Yes.

261
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,209
And your cold?

262
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,145
Yes.

263
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,045
I was very worried about you.

264
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,622
And I enjoyed your performance.

265
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,652
I have to practice more.

266
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,798
Everyone's waiting.

267
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,458
I snuck out.

268
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,510
I still have the firefly.

269
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,140
It's healthy, like me.

270
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,797
Hi.

271
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,196
Sorry I'm late.

272
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,599
Hi, Ji-hyae.

273
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,772
Sang-min, I won.

274
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,931
We made a bet.

275
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,637
I bet you'd come,
and Sang-min bet you wouldn't.

276
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,775
You have to treat dinner.

277
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,474
Okay, I will.

278
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,631
What are you looking at?

279
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,472
I have to go.

280
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,508
Why are you going so early?

281
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,949
Sang-min is treating us to dinner.

282
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,986
Three's a crowd.

283
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,419
You bad girl.

284
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,650
You're too smart.

285
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,761
Sang-min!

286
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,987
Ji-hyae said she's leaving.

287
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,862
But you should eat first.

288
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,229
And we can talk about the play, too.

289
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,168
Ji-hyae never changes her mind.

290
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,137
Right, Ji-hyae?

291
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,366
Right.

292
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,670
See?

293
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,244
That's too bad.

294
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,109
It would've been nice
if you came.

295
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,947
Ever seen Sang-min
treat anyone like this?

296
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,654
He's doing this
because you're my friend.

297
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,516
He's just being nice,
so you can go.

298
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,820
It's okay.

299
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,400
Wait!

300
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,073
I bought presents today.

301
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,947
I also got you one,
so you wouldn't feel alone.

302
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,716
I bet you won't
be able to sleep tonight.

303
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,018
This isn't like Sang-min.

304
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,888
It's because you're a good friend.

305
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,793
If it wasn't for me,
you'd never get this.

306
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,198
Pick one.

307
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,940
Ji-hyae!

308
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,648
I like your present better.

309
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,976
It's okay to switch, right?

310
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,219
Bye!

311
00:42:55,506 --> 00:43:00,307
"When the sun shines on the sea,
I think of you.

312
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,749
When the dim moonlight is
on the spring, I think of you."

313
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,043
Really? Is that what it says?

314
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,652
Oh my gosh, Sang-min must
really like me a lot.

315
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,987
You have to give it
to me tomorrow, okay?

316
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,559
Okay.

317
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,692
I have no reason to see him anymore.

318
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,237
He wants to be with Soo-gyung now.

319
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,435
When the sun shines on the sea...

320
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,734
When the dim moonlight
is on the spring...

321
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,545
Are you done?

322
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,187
Wait a little longer.

323
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:55,091
Hand in your manure
in an envelop after lunch.

324
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:55,890
Got it?

325
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:56,862
Yes, sir.

326
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,535
Those who didn't bring it,
hurry and go take a shit!

327
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,068
Got it?

328
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,456
Joon-ha.

329
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,959
I'll close my eyes and run,
so you guide me, okay?

330
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,252
I'm really closing them.

331
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,489
Okay.

332
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,224
Joon-ha.

333
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,928
Wanna come with me to learn
the polka dance after class?

334
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,300
Polka?

335
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,772
I'm gonna meet Joo-hee there.

336
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,945
It's my dad and his friend's idea.

337
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,479
They want us to meet
at a healthy recreation.

338
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,515
A lot of girls will be there,
so you pick one up.

339
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,414
- Gonna come, right?
- I don't know.

340
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,051
Tae-soo!

341
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,471
Joo-hee,
this is my friend Oh Joon-ha.

342
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:23,044
She's the one I told you about.

343
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,146
I'm Oh Joon-ha.

344
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,409
Nice to meet you.

345
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,210
Hello.

346
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,791
Are you two friends?

347
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,918
Know each other?

348
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,428
No, we don't.

349
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,228
He's my best friend.

350
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:56,040
This is my friend, Na-hee.

351
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,810
Hi, I'm Na-hee.

352
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,779
I'm Yoon Tae-soo.

353
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:02,646
I'm Oh Joon-ha.

354
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,845
Everyone please have a seat.

355
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,315
Anywhere is fine.

356
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:29,373
Today I will teach you
the polka dance.

357
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,207
Sounds fun, right?

358
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,448
I missed you.

359
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,559
Me, too.

360
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,872
I didn't know
you were Tae-soo's friend.

361
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,970
I want to be a woman anchor.

362
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,734
So I always practice my speech.

363
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:16,203
Can you do this?

364
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,641
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

365
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,579
Did I do okay?

366
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,284
I can do it faster.

367
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:27,946
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

368
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,182
Shall I do it faster?

369
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,692
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

370
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,660
Give it a try.

371
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:42,527
Peter Piper a pecked
of peppers pickled...

372
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,700
You'll need
a lot of practice.

373
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,639
Repeat precisely after me.

374
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:53,681
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

375
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,577
We should split up now.

376
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,794
I'll take Joo-hee home,
so you take care of Na-hee.

377
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,294
Okay?

378
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,962
See you later.

379
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,961
I had fun.

380
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,159
Good night.

381
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,133
Bye Joo-hee.

382
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,029
Good night.

383
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,726
What are you doing?

384
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,458
Let's get going.

385
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:53,766
Joon-ha,
then try something easier.

386
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,575
Try this.

387
00:51:55,846 --> 00:52:01,148
She sells seashells
by the seashore.

388
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,979
Easy, huh?

389
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,347
Give it a try.

390
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,077
Pardon?

391
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,087
I said give it a try.

392
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,454
Give what a try?

393
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,864
She sells seashells
by the seashore.

394
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,365
Give this a try.

395
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,195
I can't.

396
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:21,994
Please don't ask me to.

397
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,671
You can't do this?

398
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:29,105
She sells seashells
by the seashore.

399
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,177
It's easy.

400
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,750
She sells seashells
by the seashore.

401
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,888
Have a good...

402
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,499
Good-bye.

403
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,622
The card.

404
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,701
I should've known
there'd be a card for me.

405
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:44,466
Ji-hyae?

406
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,576
Oh, hello.

407
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,582
Where are you headed?

408
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,624
To the library.

409
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,154
That far?

410
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:06,955
It's not far.

411
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,091
I won't get so wet
if I stop at each building.

412
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,469
Then I'll take you there.

413
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,013
With my umbrella.

414
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,816
Think of that building
as a shed and run.

415
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:33,614
One.

416
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:34,380
Two.

417
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,149
Three!

418
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,802
Thanks so much.

419
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,435
But you're soaked.

420
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,376
I was going to get wet anyway.

421
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,389
I should be going.

422
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,682
Thanks again.

423
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,554
Okay, I'll see you later.

424
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,278
I didn't think we'd meet again.

425
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,251
But why does the library
have to be so close?

426
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:49,141
She hasn't mailed me back yet.

427
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,713
Joo-hee?

428
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,288
Yeah.

429
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,519
Why not?

430
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,093
I don't know.

431
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,090
I'm not the type to
fall in love with one girl.

432
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,563
But I must really like her.

433
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,084
Tae-soo?

434
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,783
Hi.

435
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,958
What are you doing here?

436
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,658
I was waiting for you.

437
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,824
Please take these flowers.

438
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:43,630
I like you, Joo-hee.

439
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,014
Please write to me.

440
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,754
That's strange.

441
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,885
Is it because I'm too tall?

442
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,921
Why do I keep fainting?

443
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,907
I'm out of breath.

444
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,984
It's because of Tae-soo, right?

445
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,985
What do you think I should do?

446
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,757
Tell me.

447
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,995
Tae-soo is a rotten bastard.

448
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,258
No, Tae-soo is nice.

449
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:26,874
He's a rotten bastard
because he's too nice.

450
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:34,580
Tae-soo is waiting for your letter.

451
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,192
There's no hope.

452
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,992
There's nothing we can do for us.

453
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,325
Don't say that.

454
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,827
There's a way.

455
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:05,513
No, there's nothing
more we can do.

456
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,739
Nothing.

457
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,085
We can only be hurt.

458
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,058
It'll work out.

459
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,239
I won't see neither you

460
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,776
nor Tae-soo anymore.

461
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,249
I'm serious.

462
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,478
I won't see anyone.

463
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,373
Hey, limousine boy!

464
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,809
Come here.

465
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:19,110
Limousine boy, forget to bow?

466
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:25,092
So you don't wanna bow,
is that it?

467
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,890
If you have a chauffeur,
you don't have to bow, huh?

468
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:36,365
Your badge is on wrong,
and your shirt's unbuttoned.

469
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:40,832
Fine, today I'll give you
the worst beating ever.

470
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,910
I'm gonna beat you all
starting from the left.

471
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,855
The first one gets hit once,
the second one gets hit twice.

472
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:00,427
From the third,
shout out your turn.

473
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:01,562
Got it?

474
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,629
Yes, sir.

475
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,094
You sissies, I can't hear you!

476
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,825
Yes, sir!

477
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:07,797
Seven.

478
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,337
Stay still!

479
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:21,007
- Ouch, my back.
- Stay still,

480
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,912
or I'll break your arm.

481
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,525
You get one more beating.

482
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,191
Get into position!

483
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,857
Listen to what I said,
and get into position!

484
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,801
What's the count?

485
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,905
I said what's the count?

486
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,715
Then I'll tell you.

487
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,249
You're nineteen.

488
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,119
One.

489
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:01,720
Two.

490
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,289
Three!

491
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,629
Hey, get up!

492
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,592
Get up!

493
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:15,762
Hey.

494
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,869
Hey, what's wrong with you?

495
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,438
It's about Joo-hee.

496
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,871
I don't think she likes me.

497
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,916
I gave her flowers
and even kissed her,

498
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,214
but there's no response.

499
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,349
You kissed her?

500
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,452
Yeah.

501
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:48,319
When the sun shines on the sea,
I think of you.

502
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:53,227
When the dim moonlight is
on the spring, I think of you.

503
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,274
Use this and go home.

504
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,980
Stay out of the rain.

505
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,044
Dummy.

506
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,549
Do you want to get electrocuted?

507
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,182
You're crazy.

508
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,580
I don't want to
split up like this.

509
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,055
Let's talk just for a moment.

510
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,694
Nothing can change.

511
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,023
There's no use in talking.

512
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,563
Let go of me!

513
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,059
Here's your letter.

514
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:33,886
I don't want it anymore.

515
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,587
Why?

516
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:39,427
There's no response,
and because of my conscience,

517
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,234
I'll write it myself
from now on.

518
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,229
And tell the truth.

519
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,404
It's a golden opportunity.

520
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,612
I heard she's very sick
from the rain.

521
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,278
So she's in the hospital.

522
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,086
She's very sick?

523
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,752
Because of the rain?

524
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,117
Yeah.

525
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,220
I'm going to see her.

526
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:09,525
If I visit her when she's sick,
then I can score.

527
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:15,292
I'm gonna confess to her
that I didn't write the letters.

528
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,900
I won't tell her it was you.

529
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:22,967
Actually, I'm not the type
to like one girl,

530
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:27,079
but I really like her.

531
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,046
Oh Joon-ha!

532
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:33,583
He's calling you.

533
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,385
Yes?

534
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,291
I have to eat all this?

535
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,693
Look at this.

536
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:48,598
Mawworms, intestinal worms,
hookworms, roundworms.

537
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,102
You have everything.

538
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,705
What the hell did you eat?

539
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,532
Because of you, our class
has the most parasites.

540
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,405
But teacher, it's not my manure.

541
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,910
Then whose is it?

542
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,346
You're the only one
who'd have this many parasites.

543
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,745
Eat it now!

544
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,462
Yoon Tae-soo.

545
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,100
Eat three.

546
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,669
But it's the same manure.

547
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,542
Yeah, but some spots have
more parasites and some don't.

548
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,628
How'd you know I was here?

549
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:59,032
Why are you covering your face?

550
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,199
Stop it.

551
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,876
I haven't washed my face,
so it's dirty.

552
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,479
But you're still pretty.

553
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,113
How'd you know I was here?

554
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,749
I heard from Tae-soo.

555
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,348
Why are you laughing?

556
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:17,517
I heard you ate
32 worm-killing pills.

557
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,757
Tae-soo, that bastard,
has a big mouth.

558
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,996
Did he say anything else?

559
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:40,473
After being silent for a while,
that's all he said and left.

560
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,015
Really?

561
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:45,820
He's so odd.

562
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,616
Are you very sick?

563
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:56,858
I'm sorry.

564
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,132
I must be really stupid.

565
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,964
Besides liking you,
I'm not good at anything else.

566
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,479
No, there's a lot
you're good at.

567
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,617
Like getting drenched,
and eating worm pills.

568
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:18,817
Don't laugh.

569
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,012
This is serious.

570
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:27,854
I have to tell Tae-soo about us.

571
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:32,433
Then we can clear our conscience.

572
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:37,093
See you later.

573
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,568
Is this her room?

574
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,136
My poor daughter-in-law!

575
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,945
How'd you get so drenched?

576
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,312
No, lie down.

577
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,455
A cold can't be taken lightly.

578
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,551
You can catch pneumonia.

579
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,092
So are you eating well?

580
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:04,159
You should eat well to recover.

581
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,967
I'm sorry.

582
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,265
This must be the wrong room.

583
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,819
Wrong room.

584
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:49,136
Clench your fists.

585
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,446
Raise them like this.

586
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,079
Now hit me.

587
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,155
Why should I hit you?

588
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,553
Hurry and hit me!

589
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:09,754
I don't like hitting people
or getting hit.

590
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,992
Joo-hee and I have been
seeing each other.

591
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,729
Actually, she gave me
this necklace last summer.

592
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,070
Are you okay?

593
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:27,170
Damn it, I've fallen again.

594
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,748
Don't worry.

595
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:36,884
And don't let my dad
see that necklace.

596
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,986
He'll get furious.

597
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,957
That necklace is a gift from my dad.

598
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,929
To Joo-hee.

599
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:01,639
Later on, we went on school break.

600
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:06,953
And I thought
I couldn't see her again.

601
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:08,754
I miss you.

602
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:12,156
I miss you so much I'll die.

603
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:17,625
And I'm curious how much
our river has changed.

604
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:24,895
Say hi to our haunted house,
the shed, and our row boat.

605
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,970
Say that I miss them,

606
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,200
and that I'm doing okay.

607
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:35,513
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me
with your Uncle's address.

608
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:40,178
He also confessed
a shocking thing to me.

609
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:45,825
That you were the one
who wrote the letters to me.

610
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,457
How could you hide that from me?

611
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,130
Anyway, it's okay.

612
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,801
I almost threw away those letters,

613
01:17:56,905 --> 01:18:01,501
but now I can read them again,
and think of you.

614
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,678
Tae-soo also made a suggestion.

615
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:11,742
That you put Tae-soo's name
on the letters you sent me.

616
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:16,983
So that my parents know that
we're still exchanging letters.

617
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,425
Look outside the window.

618
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:25,497
If the branches
swing gently in the wind,

619
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:29,863
then the one you love
is loving you, too.

620
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,132
Right now it's snowing outside.

621
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:37,378
When it first snows,

622
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:40,778
they say you should
stroll with your beloved.

623
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,613
But I'm just writing a letter.

624
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,744
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

625
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:51,117
I'm going to get permission
to go to Grandpa's house.

626
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,286
If I do, I'll send you a telegraph.

627
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,765
Open your ears.

628
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,359
If you hear your heartbeat,

629
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,364
then the person you love
is loving you, too.

630
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,233
Close your eyes.

631
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:08,771
If there's a smile on your lips,

632
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:13,571
then the person you love
is loving you, too.

633
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,301
I want to send a telegraph.

634
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,909
Then please sign up here.

635
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,408
Okay.

636
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:57,754
But fate must not be on my side.

637
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,091
One of my letters

638
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,728
was returned back to Tae-soo's home.

639
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,231
Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha.

640
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:13,838
I'm not in love with Joo-hee.

641
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:20,845
Both of them really love each other.

642
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:27,411
So that's why I gave up.

643
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,225
Two people in love should be together.

644
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,326
It's okay with me.

645
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,095
No, I love her, too.

646
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,900
I won't give up.

647
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:45,063
Are you mocking me?

648
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:51,479
You always want things your way!

649
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,108
So your parents mean nothing to you?

650
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,547
Do you know who she is?

651
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,315
She's a congressman's daughter!

652
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,232
Know what that means, you punk?

653
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,024
You deserve to die.

654
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,104
You can't even hold on to a girl.

655
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:39,052
It was the end of a winter break
I had hoped so much for.

656
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,685
Know what this is?

657
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:08,821
A belt?

658
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:12,092
No, it's a whip.

659
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:14,557
This bastard hits me.

660
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:19,859
My dad doesn't want it to,
but it keeps wanting to hit me.

661
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,768
That's why I caught it.

662
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:29,002
How should I punish it?

663
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:31,839
The death penalty.

664
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,016
That's exactly what I thought.

665
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:47,252
Kill it slowly and painfully?

666
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:52,998
Or starve it slowly to death?

667
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,001
Or give it sleeping pills?

668
01:22:58,206 --> 01:22:59,673
Strangle it to death.

669
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:04,874
Good idea.

670
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:12,413
Joon-ha.

671
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,426
Take good care of Joo-hee.

672
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:39,567
Tae-soo!

673
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,642
Somebody help!

674
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,870
A person's dying!

675
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,215
Tae-soo, you bastard!

676
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,051
Tae-soo, you bastard!

677
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:54,552
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

678
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,518
Someone help me!

679
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,420
Somebody's dying!

680
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:03,088
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

681
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:11,037
I told you to kill
the belt, not yourself.

682
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,071
Tae-soo, wake up!

683
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,972
Open your eyes!

684
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:21,377
Don't die. Don't die.

685
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,311
Don't die, you bastard!

686
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,445
Breathe!

687
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,348
Breathe, you bastard!

688
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,083
Breathe!

689
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,775
Go inside.

690
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:42,424
If you're with him,
he'll wake up faster.

691
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,066
Hurry.

692
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:06,682
Wait here for me.

693
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:38,045
Hurry and get well.

694
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:32,219
Ji-hyae, know what this is?

695
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,521
An umbrella?

696
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:37,654
A very special umbrella.

697
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,294
They're all the same.

698
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:46,172
It's special because
Sang-min gave it to me.

699
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:51,201
He must know that I like him.

700
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,679
Think he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

701
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:59,447
Go give this to Sang-min.

702
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,645
No, you give it to him.

703
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:03,217
I'm not going there.

704
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:04,619
Why not?

705
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:07,222
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

706
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:13,999
Remember when it
suddenly rained that day?

707
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,960
Sang-min was drinking coffee here.

708
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:23,333
He was looking out of the window

709
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,240
then suddenly turned to me and said,

710
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:27,438
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

711
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:33,348
And then I said,
"I was worried I didn't."

712
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:39,058
He placed his umbrella here,

713
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:45,388
and said, "You can have it."

714
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,226
He said he was okay to get wet.

715
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:56,774
And then he ran off in the rain.

716
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,555
Did you bring an umbrella?

717
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:16,225
You can have it.

718
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:26,400
It's raining a lot outside.

719
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:30,271
Sang-min might be getting
soaked without an umbrella.

720
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:52,432
This is a really
special umbrella.

721
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:57,232
I'll give it back to him.

722
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:07,806
Did you bring an umbrella?

723
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:09,482
Of course, I did.

724
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,049
Really?

725
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,750
But still, take mine.

726
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,485
Is she crazy?

727
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:43,809
You have an umbrella,
but why are you so soaked?

728
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:48,306
Because it's not my umbrella.

729
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,881
I came to return it to you.

730
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:53,677
You left it at the store.

731
01:34:56,924 --> 01:35:03,420
Am I the only one who gets wet
even when I have an umbrella?

732
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,436
Don't go.

733
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,877
You already know.

734
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:27,848
My feelings.

735
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,827
Now you know it all.

736
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:46,669
Yeah, when I saw you run
without an umbrella,

737
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:51,176
I left my umbrella behind.

738
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:57,045
Even on the day of the play,

739
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:04,817
I wanted to give you a present,
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too.

740
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,892
And if fate was on my side,

741
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:16,001
I thought you'd pick the gift
with the card in it.

742
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:24,810
I thought we'd grow distant
if I told you my feelings.

743
01:36:25,312 --> 01:36:29,373
I wanted to say that
I liked you, but I couldn't.

744
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:34,109
I'll come see the play.

745
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:45,693
Look.

746
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:47,825
I cut my wrists.

747
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,565
I saw it all.

748
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:54,032
Both of you whispering love.

749
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:56,634
Do you really love her?

750
01:36:58,078 --> 01:36:58,908
Is it really so?

751
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:01,741
I'm working out my feelings.

752
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:07,353
My eyes were looking straight,
but my heart was confused.

753
01:37:07,555 --> 01:37:10,456
Can I trust those words?

754
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:14,393
Can I think of it as a promise?

755
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:16,690
Yes.

756
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:21,727
I love only one person.

757
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,538
This person is me, right?

758
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,333
I love you.

759
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,308
I swear that I love you.

760
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:30,670
I love you, too.

761
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:33,676
Sang-min, I love you so much.

762
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:35,644
Sang-min!

763
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,231
What the hell are you doing?

764
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:01,668
I didn't even finish my lines,
and then you call out my name?

765
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:03,434
You can't just change
your lines like that.

766
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:04,839
You ruined everything.

767
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:08,345
Sang-min, I wasn't acting,
it was my true feelings.

768
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,209
I love you.

769
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,816
Love is more important than a play.

770
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:45,778
After the play,
Sang-min and I went on a date.

771
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:51,083
We decided to go to the river
where my mother's memories are.

772
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,027
Joo-hee?

773
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:06,862
No, I'm her daughter.

774
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:08,372
My name is Ji-hyae.

775
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:10,338
Is that so?

776
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:12,905
I must've made a mistake.

777
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,876
But you look so much like your mom.

778
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:21,846
I delivered a lot
of your mom's letters.

779
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:24,081
Thank you, sir.

780
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:49,614
I know well what happened
to my parents next.

781
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:56,819
Citizens and students!

782
01:39:57,124 --> 01:40:00,958
This is an illegal protest!

783
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:04,888
X

784
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:07,033
Down with the regime!

785
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:08,531
Down with dictatorship!

786
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,101
Down with dictatorship!

787
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:15,401
Down with dictatorship!

788
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:51,540
If you wipe on toothpaste,
your eyes will hurt less.

789
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:55,712
Joo-hee?

790
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:57,282
Tae-soo?

791
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,012
Put on toothpaste.

792
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,348
It's been a long time.

793
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,124
It has.

794
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:48,795
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

795
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,111
Joon-ha!

796
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:14,917
Joon-ha!

797
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:17,822
Joon-ha!

798
01:43:26,733 --> 01:43:27,893
Joon-ha!

799
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,230
Joon-ha!

800
01:43:36,944 --> 01:43:38,309
Joon-ha...

801
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:47,348
Joon-ha, come back alive!

802
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:51,151
Joon-ah!

803
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:55,354
You have to come back alive!

804
01:43:56,964 --> 01:43:58,192
Joon-ha!

805
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:02,667
Joon-ha, answer me!

806
01:44:03,804 --> 01:44:05,169
Joon-ha!

807
01:44:08,175 --> 01:44:09,608
Joon-ha...

808
01:44:11,812 --> 01:44:16,511
Joon-ha, come back alive!

809
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,152
Joon-ha!

810
01:44:21,989 --> 01:44:24,048
You have to come back alive!

811
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:27,091
Joon-ha!

812
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:57,553
Joo-hee!

813
01:45:09,936 --> 01:45:12,336
Joo-hee! Tae-soo!

814
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:13,597
Joon-ha!

815
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,784
You have to come back alive!

816
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:30,217
You better!

817
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:35,760
Joon-ha, come back alive!

818
01:45:37,264 --> 01:45:39,755
You have to come back alive!

819
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:36,539
Corporal Oh!

820
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:42,646
Medic! Medic!

821
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,287
Hold on! Hold on!

822
01:47:45,492 --> 01:47:47,824
Breathe! Breathe!

823
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:50,258
Stop it! He's dead!

824
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:51,897
Retreat!

825
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:53,725
Get moving, you bastard!

826
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,834
He's already dead!

827
01:48:56,563 --> 01:48:59,828
Joon-ha, you bastard!

828
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,160
Where are you going?

829
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:03,802
Come back!

830
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:15,610
You haven't changed at all.

831
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:19,023
Just like in the past,

832
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:22,993
you're still pretty.

833
01:53:26,432 --> 01:53:30,630
I've aged a lot.

834
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:45,508
You had it hard, huh?

835
01:53:45,685 --> 01:53:47,175
Not really.

836
01:53:55,762 --> 01:53:58,822
How's Tae-soo doing?

837
01:54:02,202 --> 01:54:07,162
I guess he's doing alright.

838
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:19,243
Why haven't you married yet?

839
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:28,891
I've already gotten married.

840
01:54:36,636 --> 01:54:38,604
I heard.

841
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:48,209
I had so much I wanted to tell you.

842
01:54:48,514 --> 01:54:53,008
But now that we've met
I can't remember.

843
01:55:08,935 --> 01:55:11,460
It's a piano doll.

844
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:14,402
We have one at my home, too.

845
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:18,606
When I look at it,

846
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:21,640
it reminds me of you
playing the piano.

847
01:55:30,056 --> 01:55:32,854
It looks so much
like you back then.

848
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,650
Doesn't it?

849
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:54,577
We were so innocent back then.

850
01:55:54,981 --> 01:55:57,142
But the past has gone now.

851
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:04,289
I think our feelings
took the best of us.

852
01:56:04,490 --> 01:56:09,154
We cried and laughed
at the smallest things.

853
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:42,319
How do I look right now?

854
01:56:45,131 --> 01:56:47,497
You look healthy.

855
01:56:48,134 --> 01:56:55,438
But I'd like to see you
look happier.

856
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:04,248
I'm crying right now.

857
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:07,908
Can't you see my tears?

858
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:19,695
Why'd you hide the fact
that you couldn't see?

859
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:32,371
It's late.

860
01:57:32,812 --> 01:57:35,007
Sorry, I have an appointment.

861
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:36,773
I have to go.

862
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:32,427
I'm sorry.

863
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:34,672
It was almost perfect.

864
01:58:35,141 --> 01:58:37,666
I could've succeeded.

865
01:58:38,077 --> 01:58:43,447
I even came here last night
and practiced a lot.

866
01:58:45,985 --> 01:58:48,283
You almost fooled me.

867
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,447
You did a good job.

868
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:55,519
I nearly believed you.

869
01:58:57,864 --> 01:58:59,229
Also...

870
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:08,904
I risked my life
to return this necklace to you.

871
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:21,547
Please don't.

872
01:59:23,623 --> 01:59:26,183
This necklace is yours.

873
02:00:26,752 --> 02:00:30,244
Afterwards, mom and dad got married.

874
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,616
And I was born three years later.

875
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:38,261
Then a few years later...

876
02:01:17,103 --> 02:01:18,536
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

877
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:39,320
Joon-ha's last wish was for you
to spread his dust in this river.

878
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:54,938
Actually, Joon-ha got married
right after you did.

879
02:01:59,845 --> 02:02:06,045
Poor guy even had a son.

880
02:02:28,674 --> 02:02:30,301
And Joon-ha

881
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:37,010
wanted you to have this.

882
02:03:37,443 --> 02:03:39,377
Mommy, it's a rainbow.

883
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:57,455
I still remember clearly
the rainbow I saw that day.

884
02:07:59,505 --> 02:08:00,995
Open your hands.

886
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,089
