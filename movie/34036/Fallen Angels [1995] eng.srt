1
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:35,592
Are we still partners?

2
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,967
We've been business partners
for nearly three years.

3
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:42,899
This is the first time
we've ever sat together.

4
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,602
We hardly ever see each other.

5
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,914
I know how hard it is for a man
to control his passion.

6
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,774
Partners shouldn't get emotionally
involved with each other.

7
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,618
Fallen Angels

8
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,524
Paging 3662.

9
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,994
I'd like to leave a message.

10
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:35,463
I'll meet his friends tomorrow.

11
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,860
Where and when?

12
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,386
Most people work from 9 to 5.

13
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:00,991
I'm the opposite.

14
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,302
My job is simple.

15
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,604
I visit friends now and again.

16
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,071
I don't know any of these people.

17
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,511
They don't interest me, either.

18
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,954
Soon, they'll be history.

19
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,567
- Going out?
- Yes.

20
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:11,541
One's profession is very often
determined by one's personality.

21
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:14,808
I love my job...
no decision making.

22
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:21,190
Like who's to die, where and
when - is all planned by others.

23
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:26,291
I'm a lazy person. I like others
to arrange things for me.

24
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,159
That's why I need a partner.

25
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:07,883
Ming?

26
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:11,394
Ming?

27
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,601
It is Ming, isn't it?

28
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,170
Remember me? I'm Hoi.

29
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:22,003
Remember? We were in the same
class at junior high.

30
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:23,042
Yes...

31
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,612
What a coincidence

32
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,745
If my Mercedes hadn't broken down
we wouldn't have met.

33
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,188
Everyone has a past.

34
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,293
Even an assassin once had
classmates at junior high.

35
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:36,930
Whenever I bump into old pals...

36
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:40,103
...they always ask the
same old questions.

37
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,264
What do you do for a living?

38
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,736
Got a card?
We must keep in touch

39
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,949
Let's arrange something.
What'd you think?

40
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,813
As long as there's money
to make...

41
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:57,754
You run your own business?

42
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:59,792
Are you married?

43
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:02,933
Don't tell me you're still single?

44
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:07,833
Hey a son.
He looks exactly like you

45
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:11,671
You're telling me...Your
wife's a nigger, eh?

46
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:15,077
You're very liberal.
Blacks...They're beautiful.

47
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:19,825
Color doesn't matter, does it?
You really look like a couple.

48
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,356
Say, are you insured?

49
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:27,194
Think about it. I'm a pro.
Insurance is my business.

50
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,668
You know, I've been crowned
'King of the Brokers'… 

51
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,232
...in Southeast Asia.

52
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:36,244
TlME is doing an interview
with me in the next few days.

53
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,951
Look, for old time's sake...

54
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:42,055
I'll work out a decent plan for you.

55
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,591
You may not want to hear this...

56
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:49,995
...but accidents happen, your
family needs protection.

57
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:51,897
Your job involves travel.

58
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,372
You must think of your
family unit.

59
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:56,701
Would an insurance company...

60
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,210
...underwrite a professional
killer, I wonder?

61
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:03,750
I'd love to take up his offer...
but who do I name as beneficiary?

62
00:12:04,054 --> 00:12:07,684
Remember the big bosom?
The one we both fancied?

63
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,821
We're getting married next week.
Here's an invitation card.

64
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,926
Just fill in your name, okay?

65
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:18,671
Please come, and I'll have
the insurance ready for you.

66
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,338
Bring your wife along, too.
See you.

67
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:26,044
Ages ago I paid a black woman
$30 to pose with me for a photo.

68
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:29,618
Whenever people asked
I'd say she's my wife.

69
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:33,985
And the kid in the picture? I think
I bought him an ice cream.

70
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,526
I always wanted to go
to a wedding reception.

71
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:41,763
But I know it's not my scene.

72
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:40,601
Sifting through a man's rubbish...

73
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,239
...one can easily find clues
as to his background.

74
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:48,009
He visits this bar a lot.

75
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,688
Likes the laid-back atmosphere.

76
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:57,152
I always sit at the same table
he sat at.

77
00:14:57,195 --> 00:15:00,893
Makes me feel sort of
closer to him.

78
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,341
There are some people you
can never get close to.

79
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:16,053
Get too close,
and you'll find him boring.

80
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:21,096
I'm someone
who plays by the rules.

81
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:26,262
I know how to be easygoing.

82
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,881
No, he hasn't come home.

83
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:08,057
- You're telling the truth?
- Why should I lie?

84
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:12,161
You live here?

85
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:14,061
Of course.

86
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,567
- Ever seen this person?
- No.

87
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:32,953
Keep out of sight.
The cops are still outside.

88
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:48,107
Where is your son?

89
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,076
We rub shoulders with people
every day.

90
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:55,691
Strangers who may even become
friends or confidants.

91
00:20:56,227 --> 00:21:00,893
One thing I do know - these cops
will never be my friends.

92
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:05,638
My name's He Qiwu.
My prison number was 223.

93
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:09,943
I haven't seen him for days.
I'll inform you when he returns.

94
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:12,943
I saw him come in.
I want the truth.

95
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,387
That's enough. Keep still.

96
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,019
I'm a very happy man.

97
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,655
I was very talkative
when I was small.

98
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:48,057
But since eating an out of date can
of pineapple when I was five...

99
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,563
…I lost my voice.

100
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:54,271
For this reason,
I have very few friends.

101
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:57,603
I also found it difficult
to find a job.

102
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,440
So I finally decided
to be my own boss.

103
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:22,071
Having no capital,
my only option...

104
00:22:22,315 --> 00:22:26,582
...was to enter shops after hours
and run my business that way.

105
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,881
I don't mean to take advantage,
but it's practical...

106
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:34,621
to run an all-night business.

107
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:41,868
Customers do come in at 3 a.m.
to buy meat. Business is business.

108
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,742
Always satisfy the needs
of your customer.

109
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:48,711
As the old saying goes,
'The customer is always right'.

110
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:52,884
And as the boss, I must be
kind, caring and tolerant.

111
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:55,188
One can't afford to be selfish...

112
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:58,425
...there's no such thing as a
free lunch in this world.

113
00:22:58,465 --> 00:23:02,095
I always work very hard at night
- well, until very late.

114
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:06,100
I don't make a fortune,
but I'm happy.

115
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:26,897
Are you crazy? Why are you
making me wash my clothes?

116
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,432
I'm a beggar. The last thing
I need is a laundry.

117
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,238
Leave me alone...

118
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:37,741
You are crazy.
Get your hands off my clothes.

119
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,479
Sod off!
I'll smash you to pulp.

120
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:46,561
Okay, I'll pay you...
if it's money you want.

121
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,223
Cretin

122
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,629
Leave it
I don't want an eggplant.

123
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:57,437
No, I don't want them
I must act like a lady.

124
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:00,878
I don't accept freebies from
strangers. People will talk.

125
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,347
I'll have a melon, okay?

126
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,354
Here!

127
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,565
What the hell
You crazy or something?

128
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:17,801
Stop that

129
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:24,279
Listen, I washed
my hair yesterday...

130
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:32,217
Ouch, take it easy...

131
00:24:32,562 --> 00:24:34,928
Don't scratch

132
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,864
I just want a late snack.

133
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,008
I don't need a shampoo.

134
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:49,746
Okay, you win.
Do what you like

135
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:55,950
No.

136
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,764
I don't want a shave

137
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:08,272
Don't touch me...

138
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:15,781
Listen, I know I'm difficult,
but I know some...

139
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:18,015
...who aren't

140
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,860
Please don't shave me...
I don't want a shave...

141
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,400
I'll pay you not to, okay?

142
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:30,070
Thanks.

143
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,339
A double cone, please.

144
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:36,907
Fuck, it's you.

145
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,745
I'm sorry...sorry...

146
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:51,865
Stop pulling my hair, okay?

147
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:54,466
I'll serve myself.

148
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:03,515
I'll do it.

149
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:14,597
Hi, it's me.
What are you doing?

150
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,933
Go to bed, don't wait up.

151
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,210
I'm having some ice cream.

152
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:28,716
I hope I can come home soon.dd

153
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:32,685
I don't know how much more
I'll have to eat.

154
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,925
Of course I'll have to pay

155
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:44,239
Look, I've run into this guy, and...

156
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,281
What's to explain?
It's the truth

157
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,915
Come down and see for yourself.

158
00:26:52,189 --> 00:26:53,986
Hey

159
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:02,267
Oh, no way
I can't eat that.

160
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,606
It'll burn my mustache.

161
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,142
This is beyond a joke...

162
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:17,649
What the hell's going on?

163
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:21,954
I said come by yourself. I didn't
say bring dad and the kids

164
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:25,367
Too much ice cream's
bad for dad.

165
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,968
What if something happens?

166
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:31,773
And the kids have school tomorrow.

167
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:34,012
What's that...?

168
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:44,786
I don't want to die
from eating too much ice cream.

169
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:47,261
Look, I'm being serious.

170
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,934
I'll pay you, okay?

171
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:55,403
Tell me how much, and I'll
buy all the ice cream. Go on.

172
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:00,917
My ice cream may be a
bit more expensive...

173
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:04,579
...but I think this family's
having a great time tonight.

174
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:09,894
I love ice cream.
When I was a kid...

175
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,923
...an ice cream van always
stopped outside our place.

176
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:15,130
Every time I saw it
I was happy.

177
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:20,407
I even asked my dad why he
didn't drive an ice cream van.

178
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:24,141
He didn't answer me.
I later found out...

179
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:27,749
...that my mum was killed
by an ice cream van.

180
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,824
I was born in Taiwan...

181
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,060
...and came to Hong Kong
with dad when I was five.

182
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,898
He worked as an assistant
in Chungking Mansions.

183
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:42,472
After my mum's death
he very rarely talked.

184
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:44,704
And we never ate ice cream.

185
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:49,216
The fact that we're both
quiet and subtle...

186
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:51,846
...probably explains the
close bond between us.

187
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,131
What are you thinking of?

188
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,166
And why the ice cream?

189
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,920
You know I don't like ice cream.
It's too cold...

190
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:24,926
...and it gives me the runs.

191
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:39,684
You're crazy

192
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:58,378
Let me out!
What are you playing at?

193
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,323
What are you doing?
I'll kill you!

194
00:30:05,657 --> 00:30:08,183
Open this door!
You hear?

195
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:24,440
Paging 9090.

196
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:27,481
I'd like to leave a message.

197
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,316
I'll meet his friends tomorrow.

198
00:30:31,026 --> 00:30:33,723
Let me know where and when.

199
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,838
It's crystal clear...crystal clear...

200
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:25,180
I just want to check
that I've got the right place.

201
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,446
It's a fast-food place,
not a barber shop.

202
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,423
You may think that we're
making a lot of money.

203
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:36,094
What price is a human life?

204
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:37,766
Depends on your luck.

205
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,563
Business can be slack for ages.

206
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,900
So, to make a living...

207
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:44,167
…I'll occasionally invest
in other businesses.

208
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,578
Like debt collection.

209
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:47,707
Thanks.

210
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:52,782
Hold on. I'll get your money.

211
00:32:58,531 --> 00:32:59,226
Here.

212
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:40,000
But lately. I've suffered
quite a few injuries.

213
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:44,104
I hate digging bullets
out of my own body.

214
00:34:45,146 --> 00:34:47,082
It's very exhausting.

215
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,715
I went to bed early that night.

216
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:55,952
When I awoke next morning,
I came to a decision.

217
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:12,776
Lady, we're closed.

218
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,347
Two weeks after I was
injured, I asked her out.

219
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,019
I wanted to tell her my decision.

220
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:24,097
But...I didn't show up.

221
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:51,396
I'm sure she'll come looking
for me in a couple of days.

222
00:35:52,772 --> 00:35:56,473
After all, we've been partners
for a long time.

223
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:07,823
Being partners, you get to
understand each other.

224
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:09,962
Almost able to read
each other's minds.

225
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,967
I'd often leave her some clues...

226
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:16,265
...to trace my actions, or
my whereabouts.

227
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:19,876
After all these years,
she's become part of my life.

228
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:28,981
But nothing can remain
the same forever.

229
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,589
I have to tell her
that I desperately want out.

230
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:36,828
But I don't know how to start.

231
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,272
So, I've devised another method.

232
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,983
A woman may come in
asking for me.

233
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:51,744
Please give her this coin...

234
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:54,514
...and tell her that 1818
is my lucky number.

235
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:11,439
1818...it's the code for one of
the songs in this jukebox.

236
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:14,352
After she's listened to the song...

237
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,350
she'll understand my message.

238
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:28,322
Okay if I sit here?

239
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
It's raining

240
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:07,404
Let's have some fun
Oh, it feels so great

241
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,474
Come on

242
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:29,301
Why?

243
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:32,370
Perhaps I'm tense...

244
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:33,779
Why?

245
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,142
You coming?

246
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,284
No?

247
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:41,550
Okay

248
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,268
Sure you don't want to come?

249
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,332
Made up your mind?

250
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,399
Forget it

251
00:39:58,248 --> 00:40:01,378
Hey...come and get it

252
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:16,433
It's not drying.

253
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:21,470
I'll take it to the cleaners
for you tomorrow.

254
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:23,142
Okay?

255
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,053
Did you hear me?

256
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,656
Answer me

257
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,399
Open the door

258
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:46,608
Hmm, nice. Fits you well.

259
00:40:48,183 --> 00:40:49,550
Whose is this?

260
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:52,352
Why?

261
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,193
Do I know you?

262
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:57,730
You bastard

263
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:05,535
What are you doing?

264
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,208
Help

265
00:41:12,017 --> 00:41:14,646
What now?

266
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,892
What do you want?

267
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:39,188
What do you want?

268
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:43,150
I'm overwhelmed

269
00:41:43,494 --> 00:41:44,462
Great

270
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:10,393
Guess why I became a blonde?

271
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:12,661
I don't know.

272
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,696
So no one will forget me.

273
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:18,940
Looks great

274
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:21,135
You're making fun of me.

275
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:23,541
No, you're very special.

276
00:42:23,951 --> 00:42:26,010
I've heard it all before.

277
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:27,551
From whom?

278
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,453
You

279
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:34,556
We were together for some time.

280
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,630
I had long hair.

281
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:41,532
You called me 'Baby'

282
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,640
Really?

283
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:47,411
Yes.

284
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:51,617
Let bygones be bygones.

285
00:42:51,956 --> 00:42:54,688
You like me now, that's fine.

286
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:00,192
I didn't say that.

287
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:04,429
I want some female company.

288
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:06,536
Fine.

289
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:09,003
Just for the night.

290
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:14,277
Maybe you'll like me
better in the morning.

291
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:47,712
Get out. On your way!

292
00:46:48,486 --> 00:46:52,547
Get the hell out of here

293
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:03,968
Hello?

294
00:47:06,377 --> 00:47:08,676
What'd you want to tell me?

295
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,277
You want to have kids?

296
00:47:12,851 --> 00:47:14,684
What's all this crap?

297
00:47:16,924 --> 00:47:19,486
You want to get married? Fine.

298
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,058
I'll marry you...but
I'll need some time.

299
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:28,373
There's no need? Why?
What do you mean?

300
00:47:28,742 --> 00:47:31,609
Oh, you dickhead.

301
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:37,307
You sent me a wedding invitation?
Why did you do that?

302
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,589
Oh, I see. Congratulations.

303
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:49,301
Who's the lucky girl?

304
00:47:50,238 --> 00:47:51,672
Blondie?

305
00:47:51,974 --> 00:47:55,239
Well, what a perfect couple.

306
00:47:55,913 --> 00:47:58,906
Me? Her bridesmaid?

307
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:01,983
What should I wear?

308
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:06,349
Chinese style? Me, as a pageboy?

309
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:09,296
Should be interesting.

310
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,000
Sure. Is Blondie there?

311
00:48:13,303 --> 00:48:15,704
I must congratulate her.

312
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:18,842
Okay. Thanks. Bye bye.

313
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:27,015
Lend me a coin for the phone?

314
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:39,971
Blondie?

315
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,143
I know you're there.
Stop playing games.

316
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:47,347
Pick up the phone, will you?

317
00:48:47,618 --> 00:48:50,179
Damn you
I'll curse your next life

318
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:52,150
Marrying Johnny, eh?

319
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,416
I only asked you to pay
his electricity bill

320
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,154
And now you're marrying him.
You scheming bitch.

321
00:48:58,433 --> 00:48:59,832
He doesn't love you.

322
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:03,572
He's using you to bear him
a son. He wants him...

323
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,675
...born in the Year of the Pig.
It's already April

324
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,741
You won't have enough time

325
00:49:09,882 --> 00:49:11,179
Oh, I get it

326
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:14,478
You got pregnant by another guy
and told Johnny it's his

327
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,815
If I ever see you again...

328
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:20,155
…I'll flush you down the pan
like the shit you are

329
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,333
Hello? Hello?
I'm not finished yet, hello?

330
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,696
Give me another coin

331
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:38,814
Fuck, the bitch hung up on me.

332
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:46,330
No

333
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,829
I need a shoulder to cry on.

334
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:02,712
The night's full of weirdos.

335
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:07,126
This one seems to turn up
wherever I go.

336
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:12,864
I'm fine now. I'll pay you back
next time I see you.

337
00:50:13,136 --> 00:50:14,662
Same old story.

338
00:50:21,848 --> 00:50:23,545
I wish I could tell her...

339
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:26,549
...you can't solve
problems over the phone.

340
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,088
You have to talk, face to face.

341
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,391
If that fails, you can
punch him on the nose.

342
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,264
I keep my thoughts to myself.

343
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:38,000
But somehow, she appears
to be able to read my mind.

344
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:44,237
I think you're right. Let's go.

345
00:51:04,107 --> 00:51:08,671
Blondie, I know you're there.
Come out if you've got the guts

346
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:11,544
We're gonna torch the place
on the count of three.

347
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,815
One, two, three

348
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:16,220
Wrong floor

349
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:20,958
Blondie come on out

350
00:51:20,997 --> 00:51:25,800
Three seconds and you burn.
One, two, three

351
00:51:27,774 --> 00:51:29,298
Let's try the next floor.

352
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:32,771
Is that a wig?

353
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,540
No way, it comes with age

354
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:38,654
Looks blond, not grey.
You related to Blondie?

355
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,017
I don't know any Blondie.

356
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:42,750
Her nickname's 'Stowaway'.
Well?

357
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:45,862
- Funny name
- Is she your chick?

358
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,601
Leave me alone, you loonies

359
00:51:49,303 --> 00:51:52,171
Pervert. Follow him...

360
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,344
- Is Blondie your daughter?
- No.

361
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,582
I can see a resemblance.
You've forgotten her?

362
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,681
- Think hard
- Leave it

363
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,820
We searched high and low
all night.

364
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:05,923
I don't think she knows
where this Blondie lives.

365
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:07,825
I give up.

366
00:52:08,463 --> 00:52:12,799
Everyone protects her, hides
her away. Where the hell is she?

367
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:14,935
Why won't anyone help me?

368
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:16,868
The slut

369
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,872
It's not fair.
What kind of game is this?

370
00:52:20,112 --> 00:52:21,740
I'm not playing anymore

371
00:52:21,982 --> 00:52:24,748
You must have slept with her.

372
00:52:25,019 --> 00:52:29,014
I bet you have, but you won't
admit it. Right?

373
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:31,156
You on vacation?

374
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:34,626
Think the whole world's
on your side, bitch?

375
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:47,343
Blondie

376
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,921
You slut. You dare show
your face? You're finished.

377
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:56,821
You bitch. Slut. Tramp.

378
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,193
Fuck you. You bitch.

379
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,439
Where does all this energy
come from?

380
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,288
Stop eating - watch the door.

381
00:53:15,556 --> 00:53:17,889
Blondie could show up
any minute now.

382
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,221
She comes here with her dad.

383
00:53:24,303 --> 00:53:27,000
How do you spell 'Blondie'?

384
00:53:31,379 --> 00:53:34,838
Oh, what the hell...

385
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,582
Listen to this.

386
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:43,159
I, Blondie, a.k.a. Stowaway,
behaved in an ugly and shameless way.

387
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,524
I'm returning Johnny Kwong to his
rightful girlfriend Charlie Young.

388
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,361
I hereby terminate all
relations with him.

389
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:53,631
Our signatures binding until
death. Great. You think so?

390
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:57,647
I'll make Blondie sign this.

391
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:00,544
Must get her fingerprints
and ID number on it.

392
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,619
Get her dad as a witness.
photograph them together.

393
00:54:03,891 --> 00:54:05,154
Blondie?

394
00:54:06,194 --> 00:54:07,524
You're Blondie?

395
00:54:12,736 --> 00:54:14,136
You're Blondie?

396
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:15,498
Yeah, so what?

397
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:20,641
Hey, you Blondie?

398
00:54:21,848 --> 00:54:26,048
I'll fucking chop you
into little pieces!

399
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,712
They say women are
made of water.

400
00:55:12,987 --> 00:55:14,419
So are some men.

401
00:55:15,624 --> 00:55:18,184
Most folk experience first love
in their teens.

402
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:20,591
I was a bit older.

403
00:55:21,332 --> 00:55:22,993
Maybe I'm too choosy.

404
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:26,736
On May 30th, 1995...

405
00:55:26,974 --> 00:55:29,033
…I fell in love for the first time.

406
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,739
It was raining that night.

407
00:55:32,615 --> 00:55:34,549
I looked at her...

408
00:55:34,782 --> 00:55:37,718
...and had this feeling
like I was a store.

409
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:40,113
...and that she was me.

410
00:55:40,258 --> 00:55:43,821
Without any warning, she
suddenly enters the store.

411
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,492
I don't know how long she'll stay.
The longer the better, of course.

412
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,759
When did you last wash?
You need a bath.

413
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:45,793
Huh? You stink all over.

414
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:50,564
When did you dye your hair?

415
00:57:54,978 --> 00:57:57,311
They say love can change a man.

416
00:57:57,615 --> 00:58:01,244
I find myself looking handsome
and becoming more charming.

417
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,547
Suddenly, I discover
my hair's turning blond.

418
00:58:04,893 --> 00:58:07,190
Perhaps it's because
my mum was Russian.

419
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,793
Dad speaks in a Taiwanese
dialect...

420
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:12,865
...which no on can understand...

421
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:15,797
...because of his strong
Russian accent.

422
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:18,373
Hello? Chungking Mansions.

423
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:21,373
Who's speaking? Blondie?

424
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:40,840
On June 22nd, 1995...

425
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,703
...the Italian team Sampdoria
came to play in Hong Kong.

426
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:46,982
I took Charlie to the match.

427
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:49,216
She's a fan of Ruud Gullit.

428
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:53,024
She was ecstatic that night.

429
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:56,928
She insisted in staying on
after the game.

430
00:58:57,198 --> 00:59:01,637
It's not right.
What was the point of playing?

431
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:07,103
They had the better team.
Our boys were outclassed.

432
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:12,279
There's no miracles in this
world. Fat chance

433
00:59:15,859 --> 00:59:17,950
Do you know why I came?

434
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:23,427
I was actually hoping
for a miracle.

435
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:27,339
Johnny's a great fan of Gullit.

436
00:59:27,608 --> 00:59:29,269
I thought he would come.

437
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,178
He wouldn't have had time.
He's getting married tomorrow.

438
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,383
Guess why I was
yelling and waving...

439
00:59:37,688 --> 00:59:41,648
...and acting crazy earlier?
I hoped he'd see me on TV.

440
00:59:48,903 --> 00:59:53,070
He promised me he'd come
So why didn't he?

441
00:59:55,512 --> 01:00:00,247
I realize that she still misses
Johnny, but it hurts me.

442
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:03,615
But I'm an optimistic person.
It's said...

443
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:06,293
...nothing remains the same forever.

444
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:09,121
But will it apply
to Johnny and Charlie?

445
01:00:10,033 --> 01:00:12,093
Time will tell I suppose.

446
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:29,617
Perhaps I'm being
a bit too optimistic.

447
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:34,200
A few days later, I invited
her to another match.

448
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:36,558
She didn't turn up.

449
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:41,142
I really thought she'd soon
get over Johnny.

450
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:46,409
How wrong could I have been?
It was me she got over.

451
01:00:50,122 --> 01:00:52,613
I stayed on after the match.

452
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:56,962
As the stadium lights dimmed,
I realized she wouldn't show.

453
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,895
I'm heartbroken.
Not a hope.

454
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:10,615
They say 'love hurts'...

455
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,246
...but it's different with me.

456
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:21,857
Something strange happens.
My hair changes color.

457
01:01:22,234 --> 01:01:22,961
Just like with my first love.

458
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:26,238
I also realized how irresponsible
I had been in the past.

459
01:01:27,842 --> 01:01:31,472
I shouldn't have taken over
other people's shops...

460
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:33,512
...the way I did.

461
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,048
Every shop
must have its own feeling.

462
01:01:37,388 --> 01:01:39,722
This realization cheered me up
and prompted me...

463
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:42,522
...to change my life.

464
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:58,379
Welcome.

465
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:01,451
Just for one.

466
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:06,289
We'll have a new menu
next time you come.

467
01:02:06,829 --> 01:02:07,988
Am I keeping you?

468
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:13,369
Get a glass. Be my guest.

469
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:24,911
How's business?

470
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:41,270
What's it cost to set up
a place like this?

471
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:02,462
Hi, there.
You interested in a business?

472
01:03:04,342 --> 01:03:07,642
Just wondered how much
a place like this cost.

473
01:03:07,913 --> 01:03:09,644
At least a million.

474
01:03:10,017 --> 01:03:13,282
When you live out of a suitcase...

475
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:16,321
...you don't need a place
of your own.

476
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,124
Things have changed, though.

477
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,889
Got to start planning ahead.

478
01:03:22,768 --> 01:03:25,236
I had a good chat that evening.

479
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,539
He even offered to help me...

480
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:32,837
...if I started up my own place.

481
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,446
- Another beer?
- Why not?

482
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,539
What are you really worth?

483
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:13,893
I'd stayed away from the bar
for some time.

484
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:16,906
I couldn't bear hearing
that song.

485
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:21,839
But some things you can't
escape from.

486
01:04:22,784 --> 01:04:25,982
So, after that evening,
I never went back.

488
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:04,766
Happy birthday to you

489
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,308
Happy birthday to you

490
01:05:09,716 --> 01:05:13,779
Happy birthday, happy birthday

491
01:05:14,056 --> 01:05:20,020
Happy birthday to you

492
01:05:22,267 --> 01:05:23,928
- Okay?
- Good.

493
01:05:58,684 --> 01:06:00,346
How are you?

494
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:05,887
Dad's fine. No need to worry.

495
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:11,828
I know it's your birthday soon.

496
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:14,771
Sorry I can't be with you.

497
01:06:16,075 --> 01:06:19,273
Is mum feeling better now?

498
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:25,448
Is your sister okay?
Doing well at school?

499
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:31,523
How was that?

500
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:34,362
Sato-san loves his family
very much.

501
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:39,905
Before his present job, he
used to be a film director.

502
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,339
So whenever he has family
business to talk about...

503
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:46,049
...he just makes a video recording.

504
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:51,586
I'm sure his son gets great
pleasure in receiving the tapes.

505
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:55,158
I'd like to do the same...

506
01:06:55,397 --> 01:06:57,661
...but who would I send
the tapes to?

507
01:06:58,534 --> 01:07:01,403
I can't really send them
to myself.

508
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,131
Maybe I could be like
Sato-san's son...

509
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:16,274
...and imagine the happiness
he gets from the tapes.

510
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:19,777
How much for a double room?

511
01:08:20,047 --> 01:08:21,606
With twin beds?

512
01:08:21,815 --> 01:08:22,578
Yes...

513
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:25,015
Twin room - four fifty.

514
01:08:25,288 --> 01:08:26,812
Too damned expensive.

515
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,416
You've got to be kidding.

516
01:08:34,835 --> 01:08:36,701
Forget it

517
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:38,565
Calm down...

518
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:35,681
Stop filming.
Go to bed

519
01:09:43,463 --> 01:09:47,868
That's enough
Go on, get out of here

520
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:52,853
Later that night...

521
01:10:53,227 --> 01:10:56,026
…I caught dad having a
sneak look at the tape.

522
01:10:56,497 --> 01:10:58,261
He really enjoyed it.

523
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:01,534
My memory's not that good.
but...

524
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:06,576
…I did remember that it was
his 60th birthday.

525
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:11,980
God knows why. But he gets
great amusement watching it.

526
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:14,552
And I do know that he's happy.

527
01:11:16,659 --> 01:11:18,424
Silly devil...

528
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:44,629
Working with someone
for a long time...

529
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:47,595
...you're bound to be influenced
in some way.

530
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:49,804
I know that fragrance...

531
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:54,603
...but I'm not used to smelling
it on other women.

532
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:04,347
This suits me just fine.

533
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:07,725
It's shrunk a bit, though.

534
01:12:12,604 --> 01:12:15,903
I always thought the perfume
was a bit overpowering.

535
01:12:17,111 --> 01:12:20,605
I smelt it on this other woman
this afternoon.

536
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,711
She wants to see you.

537
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:26,112
I fixed up a meeting.

538
01:12:27,758 --> 01:12:28,817
Will you go?

539
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,597
I think you should go and
get things sorted out.

540
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:43,309
Perhaps it's not such a good idea.

541
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:52,117
Anyway, I thought you'd go.

542
01:12:53,728 --> 01:12:54,956
This is for you.

543
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:50,396
I'd like...

544
01:13:51,509 --> 01:13:53,067
...a packet of crisps.

545
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:56,213
Not the red pack, the yellow

546
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,168
They sit there together
for ages.

547
01:14:36,737 --> 01:14:38,729
I wonder what they're talking about?

548
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,509
Meanwhile the rain keeps
bucketing down.

549
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:46,784
It's raining so heavily, how will
I get home by myself?

550
01:15:03,008 --> 01:15:05,636
And just when I need
a raincoat...

551
01:15:06,513 --> 01:15:08,573
...he appears at my side.

552
01:15:11,721 --> 01:15:13,551
I hope the rain...

553
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,219
...will never stop.

554
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,193
I'm not coming in.

555
01:15:23,802 --> 01:15:29,300
Then why walk me home?

556
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:34,046
You could've let me walk

557
01:15:34,317 --> 01:15:36,377
I was going to do that anyway.

558
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:39,486
You trying to be funny?

559
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:43,953
Oh, what the hell.
Just fuck off, will you?

560
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,528
We came to an agreement.

561
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:51,638
I never agreed to anything.

562
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:55,838
You insisted on seeing her, not me.
What'd you want from me now?

563
01:15:57,684 --> 01:16:01,416
You think I'm stupid?
Oh, get lost.

564
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,290
You're a cheat and a liar.

565
01:16:12,336 --> 01:16:14,569
Give me your hand...

566
01:16:20,582 --> 01:16:24,075
Why?

567
01:16:24,354 --> 01:16:26,586
I've left my mark, okay?

568
01:16:27,157 --> 01:16:30,890
You may forget my face, but
you won't forget my bite.

569
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:36,730
I'm easily recognized, though...

570
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:40,702
...by the mole on my face.

571
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:44,675
If a woman with a mole on her
face ever comes up to you...

572
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:48,781
...it could be me.

573
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:54,659
Will you remember that?

574
01:16:58,434 --> 01:17:00,164
I'll remember.

575
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:29,168
Will I remember her?

576
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,074
Actually, it's not important.

577
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:38,322
For her I was an oasis in
her journey through life.

578
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:40,718
I hope she soon reaches
her destination...

579
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:43,656
...and finds her soulmate
for life.

580
01:17:43,932 --> 01:17:45,866
We all need a partner.

581
01:17:47,635 --> 01:17:49,867
When will I find mine?

582
01:17:58,118 --> 01:18:00,716
Are we still partners?

583
01:18:19,179 --> 01:18:23,620
I don't know how to answer
her question.

584
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,617
I've come to look at partners
from a new angle.

585
01:18:28,759 --> 01:18:30,854
As a business partner,
she's perfect...

586
01:18:31,197 --> 01:18:35,659
...but not one you could
spend your life with.

587
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,771
I'm terminating
our business relationship.

588
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:57,492
Do me one last favor, will you?

589
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:09,789
I don't know why I agreed.

590
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:13,142
Probably because it's a last favor.

591
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:37,051
I want to place an advert
for my friend.

592
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:43,459
I want the front page.

593
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:15,954
The best thing about my job -
I don't have to make decisions.

594
01:23:16,795 --> 01:23:22,531
Who's to die, when and where,
it's all been planned by others.

595
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:27,231
I'm a lazy person.

596
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:30,912
I like others to arrange things for me.

597
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:34,949
But I've been doing some
thinking lately.

598
01:23:35,353 --> 01:23:37,822
I feel the need for change.

599
01:23:38,992 --> 01:23:41,017
Whether it's right or wrong...

600
01:23:41,929 --> 01:23:45,366
…I must make a decision
for myself.

601
01:24:28,593 --> 01:24:30,459
'Being photographed will
shorten your life'.

602
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:33,591
Seems there's some truth in it.

603
01:24:34,735 --> 01:24:36,795
One evening,
dad was taken ill.

604
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,301
I took him to hospital.

605
01:24:41,078 --> 01:24:43,808
A little later, he passed away.

606
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:48,043
Thanks to him, all my life...

607
01:24:48,087 --> 01:24:50,956
…I've always felt like
a little boy.

608
01:24:52,393 --> 01:24:55,523
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

609
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,067
Packing his things away
that evening...

610
01:25:00,104 --> 01:25:05,059
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

611
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:11,211
Packing his things away
that evening...

612
01:25:12,111 --> 01:25:15,040
…I felt grown-up for the first time.

613
01:25:28,579 --> 01:25:31,313
I didn't want to be grown-up...
…I just wanted dad with me.

614
01:25:31,347 --> 01:25:33,976
When I left the hotel...

615
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:35,217
…I took the videotapes with me.

616
01:25:35,454 --> 01:25:36,784
I watched them
over and over again.

617
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:25,138
Watching dad cooking
made me very happy.

618
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,602
I know I'll never taste
his steaks again...

619
01:27:31,147 --> 01:27:34,481
...but I'll never forget
just how they tasted.

620
01:27:40,793 --> 01:27:43,593
Oh, hell, it's you again.

621
01:27:43,865 --> 01:27:45,561
Not the hair. Leave it...

622
01:27:46,835 --> 01:27:50,203
I'm happy to be your client.

623
01:27:50,675 --> 01:27:52,540
Did I ever refuse?

624
01:27:53,011 --> 01:27:55,036
I didn't, did I?

625
01:27:55,314 --> 01:27:58,079
Just look at me
Let go of me...

626
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:00,311
My wife's visiting China...

627
01:28:00,588 --> 01:28:03,582
...and I've some business
to attend to.

628
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:06,555
Give me three hours and
I'll be back.

629
01:28:06,797 --> 01:28:09,529
Three hours, okay?
Three hours...

630
01:28:10,936 --> 01:28:12,596
Two hours?

631
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,205
Two hours and I'll be back. Deal?

632
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:20,838
Trust me. We're old friends,
aren't we?

633
01:28:20,882 --> 01:28:24,445
People cross all the time.
Two hours...

634
01:28:24,756 --> 01:28:28,817
Trust me, you have my word.
We're like brothers, right?

635
01:28:30,864 --> 01:28:33,231
You want it written in blood?

636
01:28:33,501 --> 01:28:35,766
You're kidding, right?

637
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:38,470
Leave it out...

638
01:28:38,742 --> 01:28:41,837
Just one hour, okay?

639
01:28:42,112 --> 01:28:45,743
Don't do this...
have mercy... Wait...

640
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:51,386
Can I have some
small change, please?

641
01:28:58,269 --> 01:28:59,257
Thanks.

642
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:06,406
I'm downstairs already.

643
01:29:06,746 --> 01:29:09,409
I'm waiting for you. 'Bye.

644
01:29:18,497 --> 01:29:21,092
Talk about bad timing...

645
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,666
Shortly after dad died,
Sato-san returned to Japan.

646
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,109
I haven't got much money saved...

647
01:29:29,145 --> 01:29:32,582
...so I can only do what I'm
best at - being my own boss.

648
01:29:33,249 --> 01:29:35,913
I'm being very cautious this time.

649
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,549
I pick only the stronger ones.

650
01:29:38,591 --> 01:29:41,221
Ones that won't get hurt easily.

651
01:29:41,529 --> 01:29:44,589
Take this one for example.
Guts of steel.

652
01:29:44,867 --> 01:29:46,835
Saves a lot of hassle.

653
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:50,498
Sometimes I run into
old acquaintances.

654
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:53,204
Some haven't changed at all.

655
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:56,038
Others I hardly recognize.

656
01:29:56,549 --> 01:29:58,983
I'm always glad to see them...

657
01:29:59,321 --> 01:30:02,484
...even though they may not
remember me.

658
01:30:03,826 --> 01:30:07,787
Of course, there are some
exceptions to the rule.

659
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:10,761
On August 29th, 1995...

660
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:13,939
…I ran into my first love again.

661
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:16,204
I don't think she recognized me.

662
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,804
I guess I'm more handsome now.

663
01:30:29,162 --> 01:30:31,597
- You're late.
- Sorry.

664
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:35,358
- What's up with him?
- I've no idea.

665
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,930
It turned quite cold that evening.

666
01:30:55,932 --> 01:30:59,461
I hadn't expected winter
to come so soon.

667
01:31:05,813 --> 01:31:08,214
I'm not used to this
kind of weather.

668
01:31:09,618 --> 01:31:13,181
It seems to have been
a long winter.

669
01:31:14,058 --> 01:31:17,222
Although I eat well every day...

670
01:31:18,095 --> 01:31:20,258
…I still feel cold.

671
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,564
I've got used to working alone.

672
01:31:26,241 --> 01:31:30,839
Occasionally I do work
with others...

673
01:31:30,881 --> 01:31:34,318
...but not on a regular basis.

674
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,185
I've learnt to be more careful.

675
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:43,695
For instance, I won't work
in hotels any more.

676
01:31:44,266 --> 01:31:47,362
And no more checking out
rubbish bins.

677
01:31:48,138 --> 01:31:50,630
I firmly believe...

678
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:54,880
...one mustn't get emotionally
involved with one's partner.

679
01:32:52,661 --> 01:32:55,256
We rub shoulders with many
people every day.

680
01:32:56,165 --> 01:32:59,864
Some may become close friends,
or confidants.

681
01:33:00,304 --> 01:33:03,367
That's why I'm always optimistic.

682
01:33:04,711 --> 01:33:06,804
Sometimes it hurts.

683
01:33:07,215 --> 01:33:10,015
Not to worry -
I try to stay happy.

684
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:18,755
That night,
I saw that woman again.

685
01:33:19,031 --> 01:33:22,002
I knew we'd never be friends
or confidants...

686
01:33:22,235 --> 01:33:25,638
...we'd let too many chances
pass us by.

687
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:29,810
Nothing happened,
there was no chemistry.

688
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:32,648
Maybe it was the weather...

689
01:33:32,984 --> 01:33:36,545
...but that night
I found her very alluring.

690
01:34:12,872 --> 01:34:17,607
I'm about to leave,
I ask him to take me home.

691
01:34:18,147 --> 01:34:21,584
I haven't ridden pillion
for a long time...

692
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:25,515
...nor have I been this close
to a man in ages.

693
01:34:26,558 --> 01:34:30,017
The road home isn't very long...

694
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:34,766
...and I know I'll be
getting off soon.

695
01:34:34,803 --> 01:34:37,329
But at this moment, I'm feeling
such lovely warmth.
