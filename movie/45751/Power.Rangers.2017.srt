1
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:53,103
地球：新生代

2
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,103
對不起
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

3
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,401
對不起
<i>I'm sorry...</i>

4
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,212
阿爾法 我是最後的希望了
<i>Alpha, I am the only one left.</i>

5
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:49,511
我們必須阻止她
<i>We must stop her.</i>

6
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:54,115
將流星降落到我這個坐標
<i>Send the meteor to my coordinates.</i>

7
00:01:57,065 --> 00:02:02,315
找到那些有價值的人
<i>Seek only those who are worthy.</i>

8
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:07,958
找到那些堅強勇敢的人
<i>Find only those who are strong.</i>

9
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:17,366
有了奇奧水晶 我們可以一起統治整個宇宙
<i>With the Zeo Crystal, we could have ruled the Universe together.</i>

10
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,910
那是不可能的
<i>That was never going to happen.</i>

11
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:24,068
那你就必須去死了 佐籐
<i>Then you will die, Zordon.</i>

12
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,396
我們會一起死的 麗塔
<i>We will die together, Rita.</i>

13
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:18,170
我們必須牽一頭奶牛 而不是牽一隻狗或者別的什麼
It had to be a cow couldn't feel like a dog or

14
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,948
根本沒有1萬英鎊重的玩意
something that isn't 10 thousand pound.

15
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:22,156
-拜託 你就不能幫幫我嗎  -我一直在用盡全力好嗎 哥們
- Come on, can you just help me? - I'm doing all the work here man.

16
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,808
-推啊 用力推啊  -傑森 它剛踩到我的腳了
- Push! Push! Come on! - Jason it stepped on my foot.

17
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,065
你快振作起來
Pull yourself together.

18
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:29,364
就把它拴在這 我們走吧
Yo, just tight the pinch and let's get out of here.

19
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:30,952
這奶牛看起來不開心啊
The cow seems unhappy.

20
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,112
不應該啊 我剛才還幫她擠奶來著
She should not be unhappy because I just milked her.

21
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,175
是他 你剛才幫「他」擠奶了
Him. You just milked him.

22
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,389
-這是公的？  -它是不是只有一個奶子
- This is a him? - Was it one udder?

23
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,234
-是啊  -那可不是它的奶子啊
- Yeah. - That's not an udder dude.

24
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,372
我剛還想說它那玩意確實有點大
I was gonna say it was actually kind off.. it was big.

25
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,561
大到我不得不用兩隻手
I had to use two hands...

26
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,251
別說了 我們不要討論這個話題了
Stop. We will never discuss this again.

27
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,393
我也這麼覺得
I think great.

28
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,603
警察
Cops!

29
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:52,116
警察來了
The cops are coming!

30
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,465
肌肉美牛 快躲起來
Beefcake, hide!

31
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:20,529
你看看外面 咋回事啊
Look out there, what!

32
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,505
- Yeah! - Yea, yeah!

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,754
好了
Okay.

34
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:45,659
- Whoo hoo! <i>- Yeah, yea. Yeah!</i>

35
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,154
- Ha ha! - Whoa!

36
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:22,257
三周後

37
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,763
我覺得我們永遠都理解不了對方
You know, I don't think we are ever gonna understand each other.

38
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,333
當你覺得你已經做了你能做到的最蠢的事之後
Just when you think you've done the dumbest thing you could possibly do...

39
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,243
你還是會做出更蠢的事
You find something even dumber and you do it.

40
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,682
謝謝
Thank you.

41
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:39,457
我告訴你 這可不是一個逞能的好時候
I promise you this is not the moment to be a wise ass.

42
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:43,856
我知道你覺得沒有出賣你的朋友們 顯得你很高尚
I know you think it's noble that you didn't rat out your friends

43
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,673
都是我一個人幹的 那肌肉美牛和我之前有某種聯繫
I acted alone Beefcake and I had a connection.

44
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:47,594
真是搞笑 你知道什麼不搞笑嗎
Yeah, that's funny. Do you know what's not funny?

45
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:50,152
本來這次是你的主場賽
This was supposed to be your season.

46
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,121
每次比賽我都勸了球探去看
I had Scouts coming to every game,

47
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,730
本來你都可以簽約了
you could have written your own ticket.

48
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:54,645
現在一切都沒了
Now it's all gone!

49
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,007
而以後每一年的週六你都必須來這
Now you're gonna come here every Saturday for the rest of the year...

50
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,281
這樣你才能畢業
Just so you can graduate.

51
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,906
跟著那些怪人和罪犯一起畢業
With all these other weirdoes and criminals.

52
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:06,949
是的
Yeah.

53
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:10,259
就像你說的 我們永遠都理解不了對方
Like you said, we will never understand each other.

54
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,053
他們能拉回比分嗎
<i>Will they level in their game?</i>

55
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,795
天使園隊能做到嗎 他們已經落後5分了
<i>Can Angel Grove do it? They are down by five.</i>

56
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:22,114
傑森·斯考特在四分衛搶佔了他的位置
<i>Jason Scott takes his position at quarterback.</i>

57
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,713
賽點來了 看起來外接手馬蒂·伯恩已經張開了雙臂
<i>Here comes the snap, wide receiver Marty Borne looks like he is open.</i>

58
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,189
他已經為傳球做好準備了
<i>He's getting ready for a pass.</i>

59
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,738
傑森·斯考特要傳球 不 等等 他沒有傳球
<i>Jason Scott makes the.. no, no, wait, he doesn't make the pass.</i>

60
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,016
他正在帶球奔跑 他過20碼了 15碼 10碼
<i>He's running with the ball, he is at the 20 the 15, the 10...</i>

61
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:35,588
傑森·斯考特得分 觸地得分
<i>Jason Scott scores! Touch Down!</i>

62
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:40,513
憑借傑森·斯考特的一己之力 天使園隊成功奪冠
<i>Jason Scott single handedly brings Angel Grove to the Championship.</i>

63
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,575
哞
Moo...

64
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:10,904
你們真是太惡趣味了
That's so bad.

65
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:22,673
這個到這邊 那個到那邊 這個從這到…
This one goes here, that one goes there, this goes from..

66
00:07:22,823 --> 00:07:24,080
這邊
This side... some.

67
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:28,089
抱歉 讓我幫你吧
Sorry. Here, let me help you.

68
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,295
你知道嗎 你真是個怪胎
You're freak, you know that?

69
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:34,376
我已經看著你玩這些玩了好幾周了 你是瘋了嗎
I have had to watch you play with these for weeks. Are you crazy?

70
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,611
不
No.

71
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,028
如果你多了一根會怎麼樣
What if you had an extra one?

72
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,490
你為什麼不把這玩意搞斷再玩點別的呢
Why don't you cut this and do something?

73
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
你咋不阻止我啊
Why do not you stop me?

74
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,165
-你咋不阻止  -嘿
- Huh, you gonna stop..? - Hey!

75
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,636
你是三歲小孩嗎
How old are you five?

76
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,061
嗨 我是傑森 這是我來這的第一天
Hi, I'm Jason. It's my first time here.

77
00:07:50,296 --> 00:07:51,337
真是太刺激了
It's exciting!

78
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:55,336
你肯定就是拘留所的老流氓了 看看你有多蠢
You must be the bully of detention. How dumb can you be?

79
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,552
你剛才是扇了我一巴掌嗎
Did you just slap me?

80
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,808
是的啊 真奇怪 是吧
I did. Weird, right?

81
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,339
以後每天我都會來這 似乎我下半輩子都得如此
Now I'm gonna be here every day for what seems like the rest of my life

82
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:12,409
我想你應該也是這樣 所以 我們做個交易吧
and I'm sure that you are too. So let's make a deal.

83
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:15,378
別坐在我或者他旁邊
Don't sit near me or him.

84
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:17,998
那樣大家都相安無事
Then we'll be okay.

85
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,871
好了 我審核了你們的家庭作業
Okay. I approved homework or being under better choices...

86
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,730
-這將是…  -我要去趟洗手間
- work with it. This will be... - I need to go to the ladies room.

87
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:33,480
好吧 大家早上好
Okay. And Good Morning.

88
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,234
噢 天啊
Oh my God!

89
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:44,233
我收到了你們的短信 我還在想 她們在哪呢
I got your text and I was like, "Where are they?"

90
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:47,589
原來你每週六不來訓練是要來這啊
So this is where you come every Saturday instead of practice.

91
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,018
-一定很糟糕吧  -是啊
- It must suck. - It does.

92
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:51,494
那你就不該把我的照片
Well, then you shouldn't have sent,

93
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,485
發給泰
Try that picture of me.

94
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,950
不是那樣的 他是個騙子
That's not exactly how it happened, I mean he is a liar.

95
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,897
-你把他牙都打掉了  -他不是裝回去了嗎
- You punched his tooth out. - They put it back.

96
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,062
不管之前發生了什麼 我們還是得向前看
Water under the, let's move on.

97
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,405
感謝上帝
Oh Thank God.

98
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,579
但是我們再也不歡迎你了
We are moving on without you.

99
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,155
我們要把你踢出去
Cutting you out.

100
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,594
我們是認真的
Literally.

101
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:13,958
啦啦操訓練你可以裝作冷漠的樣子 但是我可不會
You can chill for cheer practice if you want, but I wouldn't.

102
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,115
我去
God damn!

103
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,832
我的天 你做了什麼
Oh my God! What have you done?

104
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,052
金伯莉 你對你的頭髮做了什麼
Kimberly what have you done with your hair.

105
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:18,794
你剪了自己的頭髮
You cut off your hair?

106
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:19,994
小心
Whoa, Look!

107
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:21,713
小心門
The door!

108
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,639
嘿 謝謝你剛才幫了我
Hey thanks for that in there.

109
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,427
別擔心 我就是討厭那樣的人
No worries, I hate guys like that.

110
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:27,312
好吧
Yeah.

111
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,888
嘿 我覺得我們可以偶爾在一起玩耍
Oh so, hey, we should hang out sometime huh?

112
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,603
不是非得一起玩 我只是覺得今晚我們應該一起嗨一把
Not that we had to, I think tonight we should.

113
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,622
-你叫什麼來著  -比利
- What's your name again? - Billy.

114
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:36,296
比利·科蘭斯頓
Billy Cranston.

115
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,023
或者威廉·科蘭斯頓
Or William Cranston.

116
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,151
還記得凱奇曾經叫我「比利·抽筋石頭」
Remember Cage use to call me "Billie Cramp stones".

117
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,978
有個三年級的玩笑 叫做 比利·抽筋石頭的屁股上有個蠟筆
As a third grade joke like Billy Cramp stone is a crayon in his butt.

118
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:43,902
這當然不是事實
Which I didn't.

119
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:47,077
因為要在屁股裡塞滿蠟筆真的是不可能的
But it is really impossible to cram a ton of crayons in your butt.

120
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,633
-不 不 抱歉  -比利 我確實很想和你一起玩
- No, no, I'm sorry... Okay Billy. - I would honestly hang out with you

121
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:53,349
但是每個晚上我都得去天使園警局報道
but I have a date every night with the Angel Grove Sherriff's department.

122
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:54,634
所以 很抱歉
So, I am sorry.

123
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,645
等等 不 別走 別走
Wait! No, no, no. Don't leave, don't leave.

124
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:59,795
好吧 我承認我不是真的很想和你一起玩
Hey. Alright, so, I don't really expect for us to hang out..

125
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,196
事實上是我今晚必須到一個地方去
Truth is I need to get somewhere tonight,

126
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,303
我以為你可以幫幫我
and I could really use your help.

127
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,167
比利 我知道你要說什麼 但是我說了我身上有軟禁監控
Billy I hear you, but as I told you I have house arrest.

128
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,014
我幫不了你 很抱歉
There is nothing I can do about, I am sorry.

129
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,682
我可以幫你拆掉那玩意
I mean, I can fix that.

130
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,878
我知道怎麼搞這玩意 我有工具
I know how to trick this in, I have, I have tools.

131
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,830
在七點之前我都會在家
I have to be in my house before seven.

132
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:16,912
如果你在七點前來我家的話 我能幫你拆了它
Well, If you come to my house before seven, then I can fix it for you.

133
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,440
我也有車 也有車鑰匙
I also have a car, or access to a car.

134
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,500
如果你能幫我的話 我可以把車借你幾個小時
And If you decide to help me, you can have the car for a few hours.

135
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,421
親愛的 我們走
<i>Come on, honey. Let's go.</i>

136
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,388
別對他太嚴厲了
<i>Don't be so hard on him.</i>

137
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,990
你覺得他在街上走的時候心裡會好受嗎
<i>How do you think he feels walking around town?</i>

138
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,690
你有什麼計劃 他這輩子該怎麼辦
<i>What's the plan huh? What's he gonna do with his life?</i>

139
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,108
他本來可以有一個完美的人生
<i>He could have been so much more.</i>

140
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:23,944
噢 天啊 那是傑森·斯考特嗎
Oh My God, is that Jason Scott?

141
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,718
我的天 傑森·斯考特
Oh my God! Jason Scott!

142
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,076
比利
Billy?

143
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,190
我在
Yeah.

144
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,918
-比利   -在這
- Billy! - Yeah!

145
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:38,925
-已經六點…  -六點五十六了
- It's Six... - Six Fifty six

146
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:41,203
你還有四分鐘 在那個凳子上坐好
I know, You got four minutes. Grab that chair.

147
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,422
這些都是什麼
What's all this stuff?

148
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,551
這些東西都是…
<i>These are the things that.</i>

149
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:45,334
從我爸那找到的 大多數玩意都是我爸的
<i>I found at my dad's, most stuff are his.</i>

150
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,774
-嘿   -那網籠子在哪
- Hey. <i>- Where's the cage?</i>

151
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:49,542
在這 就是這個
Here, Here it is!

152
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,389
-把你的腳放進去  -這是什麼
- Put your foot in this. - What is it?

153
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:54,206
這是個法拉第籠 能僥倖阻擋一會發出的聲音
It's a Faraday cage. It just stops the sounds in there for a lucky.

154
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,645
那可是個3M警告信號 快點 如果信號發出去了
That's the 3 M warning. Come on up. If the signal goes out.

155
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:01,106
我爸爸已經死了有7年4個月零兩天了
My dad's been dead now, seven years four months and... two days?

156
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,167
-就是零兩天   -好吧
- Yeah, two days. - Uh, okay.

157
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:05,999
已經很久了 他曾經在礦上工作
It's a long time. He used to work at the mine.

158
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,139
比利 我不認為我們有時間…
Billy, I really don't think that we have time...

159
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:10,779
-你還住在老碼頭的44-55號房子嗎  -是的
- You still live in 44-55 Old Wharf? - Yes, I do.

160
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,079
-那是個好房子  -嗯
- Great house. - Okay.

161
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,131
關於我爸 我們曾經一起出去尋找元素
About my dad, we used to go and find objects together.

162
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,725
-一些非常古老的東西  -我要有大麻煩了 比利
- Some really, really old. - I am gonna get in trouble, Billy.

163
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,807
就像是美國破爛王那個節目一樣
Almost like that show American Pickers.

164
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:20,896
比利 信號要洩露了
Billy, the signal's gonna go off.

165
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,126
我們當時就應該上個電視節目的
We should definitely head on to a TV show

166
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:23,248
那肯定很瘋狂
that would've been so crazy.

167
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:24,340
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

168
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:27,276
哥們 說真的 信號要洩露出去了
Dude, Come on. seriously! It's gonna go!

169
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,358
比利 拜託
Billy, come on!

170
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,270
怎麼了
What?

171
00:13:39,606 --> 00:13:40,649
謝謝
Thank you.

172
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,868
你能放開我了嗎
Can you stop touching me now?

173
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,760
你能來真是太酷了
It's so cool you actually showed up.

174
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,576
你也確實給了我這輛麵包車
Well. You're giving me the van.

175
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,683
是借給你這輛車
Lending you the van, but yeah.

176
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,302
還有多遠
How much further is it?

177
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:00,785
還要開44分鐘52秒
Just 44 minutes and 52 seconds.

178
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,998
-好吧  -謝謝你今天幫我
- Okay. - Thank you for helping me today.

179
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,699
沒事的 比利
It's okay, Billy.

180
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,748
這是到金礦的入口
This is the entrance to the Gold Mine,

181
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:13,201
很顯然 比利 標誌上寫著…
and clearly Billy, the sign says...

182
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:14,745
繼續往前開就是了
Keep driving.

183
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,648
好吧
Okay.

184
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,147
如果我們找到了一些很酷的玩意 那我就分你一半
Look, if we find something cool, then you can keep the half.

185
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:22,471
這是我的規矩
It's a rule that...

186
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:26,400
他們會把這片地全炸光的
They are gonna blow this whole thing.

187
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,883
一周後這裡就不復存在了
It will all be gone in a week now.

188
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,303
比利 我能說句心裡話嗎
Billy, can I be honest?

189
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,612
我們說好的 我送你來這 我就可以借你的車玩幾個小時
The deal was I drop you somewhere I get the van for few hours okay?

190
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,681
這聽起來很奇怪 我們根本一點都不瞭解對方
This is weird. Like we don't know each other at all.

191
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,981
我也不知道我們到底來這幹嘛 你看起來…
I don't know what we are doing here, and you seem...

192
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,913
等等 我要告訴你一些事
Wait. I gotta tell you something.

193
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,071
我正在進行光譜治療
I'm on the spectrum.

194
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:45,309
是戶外鍛煉活動嗎 就像搏擊操一樣？
Is that like a workout program? Like, Tae Bo?

195
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:48,498
不 是一種疾病 你讓一下
No. It's a diagnosis Excuse me.

196
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:51,901
我知道你在開玩笑 我也是在開玩笑
I know! It was a joke. I was kidding.

197
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:53,854
這就是我要說的重點 我沒get到你的笑點
See that's the thing, I did not get the joke.

198
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,857
我的大腦不像你的大腦一樣工作
Like my brain doesn't work the same as yours does.

199
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,777
你也可以把這當成好事來看
Yeah, well, consider that a good thing.

200
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,718
我就是讀不懂別人的幽默感和諷刺挖苦
It's just that I can't read humor or sarcasm.

201
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:05,559
但是我記憶很好 能記得一切
But I do remember things. I remember everything.

202
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,558
-比利 停下來  -好吧
- Billy, let me stop here. - Okay.

203
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,159
你不必告訴我這些
You do not need to tell me all of this.

204
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,605
我們之間啥事沒有
We are cool.

205
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,605
好吧 我們就快到了
Ok, we are... We are almost there.

206
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:18,109
這是好消息吧 所以你快拿上我備用的手電
Which is good news. So Take my spare flashlight...

207
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:19,815
因為你回來的時候 天已經很黑了
Cause it's gonna be dark when you get back.

208
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:20,486
再見了 比利
Bye, Billy!

209
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:23,538
好吧
Okay!

210
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,965
她又回來了
Ah, she's back again.

211
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,590
瘋狂的女孩
The crazy girl.

212
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:45,611
真是非常規律啊
Just like clockwork.

213
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,111
你是誰
Who are you?

214
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:38,000
不是吧
No way!

215
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:43,750
哈嘍
Hello?

216
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,071
嘿
Hey!

217
00:16:49,513 --> 00:16:50,513
嘿
Hey!

218
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,363
不 不
No, no, no.

219
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:56,873
金伯莉
Kimberly!

220
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,113
金伯莉
Kimberly!

221
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,345
沒事的 沒事的
It's okay. It's okay.

222
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,789
只是聽到你叫我名字感覺很奇怪
It's strange to hear you say my name.

223
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,383
什麼
What?

224
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:06,819
你剛才說啥
What did you say?

225
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:09,821
我說聽到你叫我名字感覺很奇怪
I said it's strange to hear you say my name.

226
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:11,300
就好像我們很熟一樣
Like we know each other.

227
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:13,542
我們確實認識啊
We do know each other.

228
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:17,193
我們都認識 但是我們根本不熟啊
Oh, we know who each other are, but we don't really know each other.

229
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:19,193
我知道你曾經和泰·弗萊明在一起過
I know you used to date Ty Fleming.

230
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:22,064
那你應該也知道我把他牙都打掉了吧
Then you know I punched his tooth out.

231
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,235
我知道他把牙裝回去了
I know they put it back.

232
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:38,468
老爸 真希望你現在也在看著我 你會為我驕傲的
Dad, I hope you're watching I'm gonna make you proud.

233
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,831
老爸 忘告訴你了 我沒經過老媽同意就把車開出來了
Dad I forgot to tell you I took the van without asking Mom's permission.

234
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,741
但是我現在告訴你了 所以我想應該沒事吧
I'm telling you, so I think that's okay.

235
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,706
不管怎樣 我都要專注點了
Anyways, I gotta focus.

236
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:52,752
你在這上面幹嘛  你在跟蹤我嗎
So, what are you doing up here? Did you follow me?

237
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:55,457
我和比利一起來的
I came with Billy.

238
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,826
比利·科蘭斯頓嗎 真是奇怪
Billy Cranston? Weird.

239
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,846
我之前也在這上面見過他幾次
But I've seen him up here before.

240
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:02,651
我家就在這座山的另一邊
My house is on the other side of the mountain.

241
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,501
有時候我會爬這些小路上來 放空我的頭腦
I hike these trails sometimes to clear my head.

242
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:09,947
俯瞰著天使園 感慨這真是個渺小的垃圾鎮
And I stare down at Angel Grove and wonder how such a small crap town...

243
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,750
給我帶來了這麼多痛苦
can cause me such misery.

244
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,405
很好笑嗎
That funny to you?

245
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:17,438
不 我只是 我也這麼覺得
No, I just.. I feel the same way.

246
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:21,319
傑森·斯考特 曾經的明星四分衛 巨星隕落了
Yeah. Jason Scott, the star quarterback crashes and burns.

247
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,590
摧毀了他的事業 摧毀了我們的賽季 加油啊 老虎隊
Destroys his career and destroys our season. Go, Tigers!

248
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,167
現在的我走在街上
Now walking around town,

249
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:29,224
所有人都像在看他們家的狗一樣看我
and everyone's looking me like I ran over their dogs.

250
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:32,182
那你為什麼不離開呢
So why don't you leave?

251
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,102
離開這
You know. Just go,

252
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:35,950
我可以離開這的
I can leave here, you know?

253
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:36,994
去哪
Where?

254
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,337
去哪都可以
God, anywhere.

255
00:18:38,598 --> 00:18:39,776
那我們就走啊
So let's go.

256
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,500
-怎麼了  -你不會走的
- What? - You would never do it.

257
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,901
-試試看  -你和我嗎 你有車嗎
- Try me. - Oh, You and me? You got a car?

258
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:47,306
-我有個麵包車  -真是詭異
- I have a van. - Oh, that's creepy.

259
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,610
-不是那種麵包車  -所有麵包車都是那種麵包車
- It's not that kind of van. - Every van's that kind of van.

260
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:52,007
那我們走吧
So let's go.

261
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,810
你在挑釁我嗎 我真的會去的
Are you daring me? 'cause I'll go.

262
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,302
很好
Good.

263
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,952
老爸 準備好
Dad, get ready.

264
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,196
這沒用啊
That didn't work.

265

你不覺得奇怪嗎
Do you feel weird?

413
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,625
你是說比平時更奇怪嗎

417
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,076
我變得不一樣了
I'm not the same.

418

我也是 我變更強壯了
Me neither. I'm strong!

419

我覺得我們應該回去一趟
I feel like we need to go back out there.

421
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:39,045
整個櫃檯都在沸騰
The counter is boiling.

422
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:53,691

她在這下面呢
Ah. She down here.

424
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:07,353
確定是個女的？
Sure it's a woman?

425
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:11,296
不怎麼漂亮的姑娘 你自己來看吧
Not a great-looking woman. Come see for yourself.

426
00:30:12,676 --> 00:30:14,087

太濃郁了
It's intense.

428
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,926
你應該記錄下來
You should make a note of that.

429
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:20,032
一搜北方的載滿了死魚的捕魚船…
Smell inside of a north fishing boat that hold tons of dead fish...

430
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,821

Don't smell so good. Freaky, right?

431
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,870
你需要我們陪你一起嗎
Look, do you need us?

432
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:27,615
好吧 我也要回床上休息去了 你完成後鎖回去就好
Alright, cause I need to get to bed. Lock up when you're done.

433
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,219

我不喜歡這個地方
I do not like this place.

549
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:27,568

555
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,226
這裡好冷
It's so cold in here.

556
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:05,949
傑森 這些是真的嗎
Jason, is this real?

557
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,614
我們現在真是在一艘太空船裡嗎
Like are we really in a spaceship right now?

558
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,117
應該是的 深呼吸 好嗎
I think so. Just breathe. Okay?

559
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:11,817
沒事的
It's okay.

560
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:14,172
嘿 我們都看夠這裡了
Hey! We've all seen enough here. Right?

561
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:15,284
我們可以走了嗎
We should go now?

562
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,165
什麼  我們會出名的
What? We're gonna be famous.

563
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:19,171
-你有病嗎  -安靜
- What's wrong with you? - Quiet!

564
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:21,802
這裡面有東西
There's something here.

565
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:27,486
Woah!

566
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:29,911
那是什麼
What is that?

567
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,186
發生了什麼
What's going on?

568
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:39,682
-樓梯  -我的天
- Stairs! - Oh my God!

569
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:40,833
無路可走了
No way out.

570
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:43,767
那邊 我們走
That way. Let's go!

571
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:45,193
我正在跑呢
I'm going.

572
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:46,252
快跑

575
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,112
它們是真的
They're real!

576
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,543
放開她
Leave her alone!

577
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:23,142
我們會殺你了的
We will kill you.

578
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:24,856
殺了我？怎麼殺？
Kill me? How?

579
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:26,753
我們有五個人
There's five of us.

580
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,285
我知道 我一直在等你們
Yes, I know. I've been waiting for you.

581
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:29,515
等等 還有一個人在哪
Wait, where is the other guy?

582

一 二 三 四  他在那
One, two, three, four... Ah, there he is.

583
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,154

No no no.

584
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:38,477
你們都在了
All of you.

585
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:42,068
你在這個地下太空船裡等了我們多久了
In a spaceship buried underground? How long have you been waiting?

586
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:43,985
-今天周幾了 週一嗎  -是的
- What's the day? Monday? - Yeah.

587
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,261
那就是6500萬年了
Then, 65 million years.

588
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,335
我一直都好孤獨
I've been very lonely.

589
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:52,327
你們看起來這麼年輕
You all so young looking.

590
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:56,220
-這和那些硬幣有關係嗎  -是的 那些硬幣
- This has to do with the coins? - Yes, the coins!

591
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:59,480
不同的顏色 不同的孩子 不同顏色的孩子
Different colors, different kids. Different color kids!

592
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:01,468
沒人說你們在這
No one said you're here!

593
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,076
轉身
Turn around.

594
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:07,897
轉身啊
Go on.

595
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,892
我去
No way.

596
00:42:15,443 --> 00:42:16,792
請往前走
Proceed.

597
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,024
我覺得這應該有用的
I think this will work.

598
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:21,456
一二三四五 不同的顏色
One Two Three Four Five. Different colors.

599
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:24,174
夥計們 好好想想怎麼離開這
Guys, focus on getting out of here.

600
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:27,276
我們要團結 一旦有機會 我們就跑
Stay together and when we see a chance, we run like hell.

601
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,758
如果我們找不到機會 我們就殺了它
Okay. And if we don't get a chance? Then we kill it.

602
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:37,157
這應該不疼 我們來看看 請踩上這個腳印
Shouldn't hurt, but let's see. Please step into the footprints.

603
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:40,709
-不 我們才不幹  -嘿 有個問題 你是啥玩意
- No, we will not. - Hey, Question. What are you?

604
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:44,109
我是阿爾法5號 仿真機器人
I am Alpha 5, persona Android.

605
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:44,879
什麼
What?

606
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,858
-他說他是阿爾法5號  -我知道
- He said he's an Alpha 5... - Yes, I know.

607
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:49,948
我是個會說話的機器人 你們可以信任我
I'm a talking robot. You can trust me.

608
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:54,905
比利
Billy!

609
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:08,036
管他呢
What the hell.

610
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,145
好吧
Okay.

611
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,307
他們為什麼互相看著 是人類嗎
Why they look at each other? Is a human characteristic?

612
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:25,522
真是太棒了
Fascinating.

613
00:43:43,877 --> 00:43:46,424
成功了 太棒了 成功了
It works! This is great! It's working!

614
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:48,547
佐籐 你在嗎 佐籐
Zordon! Are you there, Zordon?

615
00:43:48,737 --> 00:43:51,282
阿爾法 我們在哪
Alpha! Where we are?

616
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:53,855
佐籐 很高興又能聽到你的聲音了
I'm glad to hear your voice, Zordon!

617
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:55,574
我能看到你 阿爾法
I can see you, Alpha...

618
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,102
但我看不到我自己
...but I can't see me.

619
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:59,263
我在哪
Where am I?

620
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:01,177
你在這艘飛船裡
You're inside the ship.

621
00:44:01,754 --> 00:44:03,242
Okay. Okay.

622
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:06,548
長官 我把你的靈魂封印在這艘飛船裡了
Sir, I sealed your essence into the ship's matrix.

623
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,938
快走
C'mon.

624
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,239
我們走 快啊
Let's go! Move on!

625
00:44:11,334 --> 00:44:13,359
這個飛船被啟動了？
But the ship is on?

626
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:15,624
因為超凡硬幣終於回到飛船上了
The power coins have finally returned to the ship.

627
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:16,964
快走 走
Go, go, go.

628
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,064
那些硬幣在哪
Where are the coins?

629
00:44:22,413 --> 00:44:25,003
超凡勇士在哪
Where are the rangers?

630
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,021
請你們過來
Come forward, please.

631
00:44:27,953 --> 00:44:29,263
我們有選擇嗎
Do we have a choice?

632
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:30,502
我不這麼認為
I do not think so.

633
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:33,864
它們說的是最原始的方言 叫做英語
They speak a primitive dialect called English.

634
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,132
你可以在飛船知識庫裡學習這個語言
You'll find it in the ship's matrix.

635
00:44:37,864 --> 00:44:40,099
看啊 是佐籐
Look! It's Zordon!

636
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:41,295
什麼
What?

637
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:44,422
佐籐 他們不知道你是誰
Zordon, they don't know who you were.

638
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:46,084
來吧  來吧
Come in, come in.

639
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,825
就是他們嗎 他們這麼小
These are them? They are so small.

640
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:50,618
有趣是 我也是這麼說的
Funny, I said the same thing.

641
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:53,206
你是要告訴我 宇宙的命運
You mean to tell me that the fate of the universe,

642
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:55,851
就掌握在這些孩子手中嗎
placed in the hands of these children?

643
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,968
宇宙？那真是個很大的地方
The universe? That's a big place.

644
00:44:58,244 --> 00:45:02,107
他們都是青少年 處於幼年和成年之間的狀態
They're teenagers. Somewhere between infancy and full maturity.

645
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:03,487
真的很難解釋
It's hard to explain really.

646
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,053
給我看看你們的硬幣
Show me the coins.

647
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,567
影像變形網不會弄錯的
The Morphing Grid is never wrong.

648
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:12,750
如果超凡硬幣回到了船上 跟他們這些…
If the power coins have returned to the ship with these...

649
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:13,677
青少年
Teenagers!

650
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:15,657
跟這些青少年一起…
With these teenagers...

651
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:19,189
那麼這些青少年就是超凡勇士
then these teenagers are the Power Rangers.

652
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:20,468
超凡勇士
Power Rangers!

653
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:23,267
什麼
What?

654
00:45:23,453 --> 00:45:25,261
好吧 快速回答這個問題
Okay, a quick question.

655
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,167
你好 不好意思插個嘴
Hello. Hate to interrupt.

656
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:29,867
剛才你們說我們是超凡勇士嗎
Did I just hear you say we're Power Rangers?

657
00:45:30,032 --> 00:45:32,952
是的 你們就是超凡勇士
Yes. Yes. You are the Power Rangers.

658
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,604
還有別的問題嗎
Any other questions?

659
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:36,636
-沒了 我沒事了  -很好
- No. I think I'm good. - Good.

660
00:45:36,888 --> 00:45:37,888
我有個問題
I have a question.

661
00:45:37,963 --> 00:45:39,520
嗨 你好嗎
Hi. How you doing?

662
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:42,504
我叫比利 比利·科蘭斯頓
My name is Billy. Billy Cranston.

663
00:45:42,817 --> 00:45:44,964
以前總有人叫我比利·抽筋石頭
Kids used to called me Billy Cramps...

664
00:45:45,096 --> 00:45:46,774
比利 說重點
Billy! Stop.

665
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,123
抱歉
Sorry.

666
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,979
這個球體裡的圖片跟我們講述了超凡戰隊的歷史
The images here in this sphere tell the history of the Power Rangers.

667
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:56,433
看起來超凡戰隊是一個保護生命的隊伍是嗎
Looks like the Power Rangers were a team that protected life?

668
00:45:56,657 --> 00:46:00,139
生命是一束強光 或者一片光亮呢
And life is a bright light. Or a piece of light?

669
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:04,013
是的 非常好 比利 它叫做奇奧水晶
Yes. Yes, Very good Billy. It is called the Zeo Crystal.

670
00:46:04,278 --> 00:46:05,728
我喜歡這個故事 太好了
Oh. I love this part. This is good.

671
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:08,372
宇宙裡每個星球都有生命
And every planet in the universe that has life.

672
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:10,973
每個星球都埋葬著一個水晶碎片
Has a piece of the Crystal buried inside it.

673
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,551
6500萬年前 佐籐全軍覆沒
65 million years ago, Zordon's team died...

674
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:16,681
為了保護這裡的水晶 也就是現在的天使園
defending the Crystal here and what is now Angel Grove.

675
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,980
超凡硬幣選擇了你們五個
The Coins have chose you five.

676
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:23,600
你們必須保護奇奧水晶和地球上的生命
Now you must protect the Zeo Crystal and life on Earth.

677
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:27,532
因為我們是超凡戰隊嗎
Because we are the Power Rangers?

678
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:28,913
他真聰明
He's smart!

679
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:31,382
抱歉 這是什麼惡作劇嗎
I'm sorry, is this some kind of a joke?

680
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,394
我們就站在這 我的鞋子也濕透了
Like I'm standing here, with a wet wedgies.

681
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,966
襪子也都胡亂的擰在一起
My socks are so squiggling around,

682
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:37,963
而我們卻在對著一面牆說話
We're talking to a wall. I mean guys...

683
00:46:38,033 --> 00:46:38,629
安靜
Silence!

684
00:47:32,423 --> 00:47:34,703
長官 我檢測到了不斷加速的心率
Sir, I am detecting elevated heart rate.

685
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,742
他們非常害怕
They are very scared.

686
00:47:37,047 --> 00:47:38,488
我不明白
I don't understand.

687
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:40,259
為什麼要讓我們做那個噩夢
Why would you show us that nightmare?

688
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:41,504
這不是噩夢
It's not a nightmare.

689
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:43,365
-這就是未來  -真的嗎
- It's the future. - Is that for real?

690
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:45,332
-好像是  -那個女人是誰
- Felt like it. - Who was that woman?

691
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,184
她的名字叫幽冥女王
Her name is Rita Repulsa.

692
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,656
她會創造天狼將軍 一個巨大的怪物
She will create Goldar, a huge monster

693
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:52,271
會從地球搶走水晶
who will rip the crystal from the earth...

694
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,210
地球上的所有生命都會死亡
and all life on your planet will die.

695
00:47:55,381 --> 00:48:00,186
有了水晶 幽冥女王就可以擁有創造和毀滅世界的能力
With the Crystal, Rita will have the power to create and destroy worlds.

696
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:04,896
讓我猜猜看 你是想我們殺了這個幽冥女王是吧
So let me guess. You want us to kill this woman, Rita?

697
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:07,753
-是的 是的 麗塔  -我們必須阻止她
- Aye, aye, Rita. - She must be stopped.

698
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:10,333
-她什麼時候會來  -她已經來了
- When is she coming? - It's already here.

699
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,435
我們估計還有11個月的時間
My best guess is that we have 11 months.

700
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,391
抱歉 是11天
I am sorry. Days. Eleven days.

701
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:18,204
如果我們是超凡勇士 而這是我們的飛船的話
If we are the Power Rangers and this is our ship...

702
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:20,705
如果我們要穿過那扇門 它會打開嗎
If I walk through that door right now will it open for me?

703
00:48:20,842 --> 00:48:21,958
當然了
Yes of course.

704
00:48:22,062 --> 00:48:23,062
走吧
Come on.

705
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,635
等等 你們在做什麼
Wait, what are you doing?

706
00:48:24,908 --> 00:48:26,388
不 不 回來
No, no, no, come back!

707
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,842
-不 別走  -傑森
- No. please don't. - Jason!

708
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:31,894
我的戰隊為了守護水晶不被麗塔奪走而犧牲
My ranger team died defending the Crystal from Rita.

709
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,189
這就是我為什麼會在牆裡的原因
That's why I'm in this wall.

710
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:36,395
你怎麼知道我名字
How do you know my name?

711
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:39,772
因為就是你 傑森·斯考特
Because it's you, Jason Scott.

712
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:44,288
你就是首領 你就是紅色勇士
You are the leader. You're the Red Ranger.

713
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:51,188
麗塔也曾是個超凡勇士 也是我朋友
Rita was a Ranger too, and my friend.

714
00:48:51,713 --> 00:48:53,489
但她背叛了我們
But she betrayed us.

715
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,518
想要獲得更多能量
Wanted more power.

716
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,690
她迷失了自我
She lost her way.

717
00:48:58,022 --> 00:49:01,272
現在她擁有的只有邪惡本質了
Now she is just pure evil.

718
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,729
你必須帶回所有勇士
You must bring them back all of the Rangers.

719
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,339
你必須訓練你的團隊 來阻止麗塔
You must train your team to stop Rita...

720
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:10,440
在她找到水晶之前阻止她
before she has the strength to find the crystal.

721
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,489
好吧 我要走了 我只代表我自己講話
Okay, I'm leaving. And I speak only for myself...

722
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,779
不 你要代表你的團隊講話
No! You speak for all of them.

723
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:19,993
你內心深處知道我說的都是事實
You know that deep down what I am saying is true.

724
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:22,159
你生而為此
You were born for this.

725
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:32,046
你們都在這  你

726
00:49:34,046 --> 00:49:35,046
你到底是誰
Who exactly are you?

727
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:37,019
真的嗎 你真的要問我到底是誰嗎
Really? Now you gonna ask me who I am?

728
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:38,960
-她的名字是嘀嘀  -曲妮
- Look, her name is Didi. - Trini.

729
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,184
她是一個月前
She's new at school

730
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,761
剛來的轉學生 我們一起上英語課 對吧
transferred in a month ago. We have English together, right?

731
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:44,100
我已經在天使園
I have been in Angel Grove,

732
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,025
待了一年多了 現在我們都是一起上生物課的
for over a year now we have Biology together.

733
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,167
-說的好  -等等
- Good talk. - Wait, look.

734
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:50,878
我們誰都不認識誰
None of us really know each other, okay?

735
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,182
但是不知為何 在比利找到那些硬幣的時候
Bu somehow, we were all in the same place...

736
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,960
我們都同時出現在了那裡
at the same time when Billy found those coins.

737
00:49:57,256 --> 00:49:57,453
還有
And.

738
00:49:57,454 --> 00:49:59,161
等等 我能問個問題嗎
No, Wait wait. Can I ask a question?

739
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:01,303
我們真的是超級英雄嗎
Are we really superheroes?

740
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,590
我們是更像鋼鐵俠還是蜘蛛俠
We're More like Iron Man or Spider-Man?

741
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:06,563
因為我記得我好想被蜘蛛咬過 但是我現在感覺超棒
Cause I feel like I've been bit by a spider, but I feel really good...

742
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:08,867
-我感覺超棒的  -聽著 哥們 相信我
- I just feel good. - Look bro, trust me.

743
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:10,433
你不是超級英雄
You're not a superhero.

744
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,673
你現在說話的語氣就像你是我們老大一樣
Why are you talking like to us like you're the boss?

745
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,330
等等 這些事會是真的嗎
Hey, hold up. Can any of this Rita stuff be real?

746
00:50:15,535 --> 00:50:17,787
-這裡有任何事是真實的嗎  -我不知道
- Can any of it be true? - I don't know.

747
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:21,170
但是我知道我們到底是怎麼了
But I know that the answer to what's wrong with us...

748
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:24,740
還有我們身上到底發生了什麼 答案就在這裡
and what's happening to us, is here.

749
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:29,496
你想說什麼
So... What are you saying?

750
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,188
我覺得我們應該回去
I think we gotta come back.

751
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:37,065
我不知道能不能勸你們都回去 但明天早上4點
I can't make you come back here, but 4'o clock tomorrow

752
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:39,226
我會在這的
I will be here.

753
00:50:39,697 --> 00:50:41,534
嘿 傑森 我們…
Hey, Jason. We don't...

754
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:45,324
當然了
Of course!

755
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:48,566
我不知道 我一開始沒想到這些
I do not know, I didn't think about that one in the first place.

756
00:51:06,502 --> 00:51:08,818
你今天回來太晚了

757
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:14,818
-你還弄出那麼多動靜來  -小心點 來 坐下

758
00:51:15,602 --> 00:51:18,818
知道你回來 我就很高興

759
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,918
你還在去上學 對吧

760
00:51:21,802 --> 00:51:24,518
查克 你沒有回答我

761
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:25,718
我知道

762
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:28,718
吃藥 好嗎

763
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:32,818
你今天去哪了
So..Where were you today?

764
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:35,516
和朋友在一起嗎 你有朋友嗎
Were you with friends? Do you have any friends?

765
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,174
-你為什麼看起來這麼累  -你已經問了她四個問題了
- Why are you do tired? - You did ask her four questions...

766
00:51:38,402 --> 00:51:39,540
她卻一個都沒回答
before she's even answered the first.

767
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,090
因為她就像是個鬼魂一樣
Because she's like a ghost around here.

768
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:43,128
她需要跟人交流
She needs to start communicating.

769
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:44,664
-瓊  -說點什麼
- June. - Say something.

770
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:47,155
-開口說話啊  -冷靜
- Speak! I just... - Relax.

771
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:48,982
好吧 放鬆
Okay, relax.

772
00:51:50,261 --> 00:51:52,293
曲妮 我們從頭開始
Okay, Trini, let's start over.

773
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:55,429
請告訴我們今天你做的一件事
Please tell us one thing you did today.

774
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,537
我和四個天使園的孩子一起
Me and four kids from Angel Grove

775
00:51:59,607 --> 00:52:01,537
找到了一個埋在地下的太空飛船
found a spaceship buried underground.

776
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:02,841
什麼
What?

777
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:06,398
我很確定我是個超級英雄
I'm pretty sure I'm a superhero.

778
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:08,814
太酷了
Cool!

779
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,380
一點都不酷
Not cool.

780
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,101
尿滿這個杯子
Pee in that cup!

781
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,338
這是在提醒我以前做的錯事嗎
It's to remind me of my screw up?

782
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:20,841
不
No.

783
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:24,109
碼頭只要了我300塊買下這輛車
Wrecking yard only offered me 300 bucks for it.

784
00:52:26,637 --> 00:52:29,417
框架還是好的 引擎也還能跑
You know the frame's straight and the engine still runs.

785
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,777
情況非常糟糕 你必須跟我走一趟
It's a terrible situation. You gotta come with me.

786
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:52,604
天使園一個沉靜的小漁村
<i>A series of grisly crimes scenes</i>

787
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:55,837
發生了一系列可怕的犯罪事件
<i>has the sleepy fishing hamlet of Angel Grove reeling</i>

788
00:52:57,251 --> 00:52:59,421
在一艘漁船上找到了一具蜷曲的屍體
<i>bodies were discovered on a fishing boat.</i>

789
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:02,209
大量的暴力…
<i>This raft of violence..</i>

790
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,176
你到底在做什麼
What the hell are you doing?

791
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:21,614
我需要金子 我要造出漂亮的天狼將軍
I need gold, I build my beautiful Goldar.

792
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,926
天狼將軍能拿下奇奧水晶 我就能拿下全宇宙
Goldar takes the Zeo Crystal I take the universe.

793
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:28,310
是嗎
They do!

794
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:05,205
真是瘋狂的姑娘
So Crazy girl.

795
00:54:05,211 --> 00:54:06,079
嘿
Hey.

796
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:07,127
我們真要這麼做嗎
Shall we do this?

797
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:11,619
你們要成為一名合格的超凡勇士必須遵守三個規則
You need to follow the three rules to being a Power Ranger.

798
00:54:11,936 --> 00:54:14,485
你們再也不能私自擅用超能力
You must never use your powers for personal gain.

799
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:18,878
你們不能挑起戰鬥 除非敵人強迫你這麼做
You must never escalate a fight. Unless your enemy forces you to.

800
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,472
你們也永遠不能洩露你們的身份
And you must never reveal your identity. ever.

801
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:25,456
為了呈現你們超凡勇士的身份 你們必須變身
To assume your ranger identities you need to morph.

802
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,426
你們有人曾經變過身嗎
Have any of you morphed before?

803
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:30,189
有過 只有在洗澡的時候變過
Yes, but only in the shower.

804
00:54:30,704 --> 00:54:33,591
好了 好了 請站在腳印上
Okay, okay, let's step into the footprints, please.

805
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,238
我們來試試吧
Let's try this.

806
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,034
作為一個團隊站在這個圓圈裡
Standing in this circle as a team,

807
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:41,795
你們可以很輕易的連接到變形電網裡
You can easily connect to the morphin' grid.

808
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:42,961
你們感受到了嗎
Do you feel it?

809
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:44,084
是真的
Yeah they do.

810
00:54:44,244 --> 00:54:45,974
不 一點感覺都沒有
No, not feeling it.

811
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,424
你們必須變形才能拿到你們的盔甲
You need to morph to get your armor.

812
00:54:49,197 --> 00:54:51,274
我就知道 我們會有盔甲的
I knew it! We do get armor.

813
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,232
傑森 我們會有盔甲
Jason! We get armor!

814
00:54:54,436 --> 00:54:56,434
酷 你什麼時候給我們盔甲
Cool! When you give us the armor?

815
00:54:56,523 --> 00:54:58,307
盔甲已經在你們體內了
You already have it inside of you.

816
00:54:58,494 --> 00:55:00,872
但是你們必須互相聯繫起來 才能讓盔甲出來
You bring it out by connecting to each other.

817
00:55:00,962 --> 00:55:02,804
也必須跟變身電網相連
And connecting to the Morphing grid.

818
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:05,938
靜下心來 集中注意力
Bury your minds and focus.

819
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:11,813
超凡戰隊由一群誓死保護生命的勇士組成的軍隊
Power Rangers were a legion of warriors sworn to protect life.

820
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:12,719
Yes!

821
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:15,609
你們必須成為這些勇士
They must become those warriors.

822
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,353
成為勇士
Become the warriors!

823
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:27,873
怎麼了
What?

824
00:55:27,905 --> 00:55:29,406
怎麼了 成功了嗎
What? Did It worked?

825
00:55:29,582 --> 00:55:31,641
阿爾法5號 他們為什麼沒有變身
Alpha 5, why they didn't they morph?

826
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:34,181
我不知道 長官 這很混亂
I do not know, sir. It is disturbing.

827
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:37,033
非常混亂 也許需要點時間
Very disturbing. Might take some time.

828
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:38,603
我們沒有時間了
We don't have time!

829
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:41,089
如果他們不能變身 那我們該怎麼辦
If they can't morph, what are we supposed to do?

830
00:55:41,195 --> 00:55:43,929
他們必須不帶盔甲去訓練 必須提前準備起來
They will have to train without armor, they need to prepare.

831
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:47,431
不帶盔甲訓練？那肯定會很疼的
Without armor? Sir that will be very painful,

832
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:49,445
帶他們去訓練場
Take them down to the pit.

833
00:55:50,963 --> 00:55:53,489
好吧 跟我來 我們要去訓練場了
Alright, follow me. We are going to the pit!

834
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:55,494
傑森 我不想知道訓練場是什麼
Jason I don't want to find out what the pit is.

835
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:58,430
這就是訓練場 很棒對吧
So, This is the pit. It's nice, right?

836
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,732
阿爾法5號 開始訓練
Alpha 5, begin the exercise.

837
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:01,671
抱歉了各位
Sorry, guys.

838
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:03,702
-什麼訓練  -冷靜點 哥們
- What exercise? - Chill out dude.

839
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:12,522
你們面前的這些生物是以麗塔的軍隊為原型仿真出來的
These creatures before you are simulations of Rita's army.

840
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,978
他們被召喚來輔助她
They are called... to get to her.

841
00:56:16,217 --> 00:56:17,621
不 不 傑森
No, no, no, Jason.

842
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,664
放鬆 夥計們 只是全息影像罷了
Relax, guys. It's a hologram.

843
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:22,861
就像電子遊戲一樣 看啊
Like video games. Look.

844
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:27,147
真是強壯的全息圖
Strong ass hologram.

845
00:56:27,948 --> 00:56:29,386
不是電子遊戲
Not a video game.

846
00:56:29,682 --> 00:56:32,185
這就是為什麼你們必須變身穿上盔甲的理由
This is why you must morph into your armor.

847
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,001
如果麗塔足夠強大來建造自己的軍隊的話
If Rita becomes strong enough to build her army...

848
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:37,629
那麼末日就要來臨
The real beginning of the end.

849
00:56:37,934 --> 00:56:40,267
勇士們 歡迎來到訓練場
Rangers Welcome to training.

850
00:56:40,503 --> 00:56:42,311
真高興你們都回來了
I'm so excited you guys are back.

851
00:56:42,818 --> 00:56:44,227
瞄準中心
Aim for the center..

852
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:45,965
再來一次
Once more time.

853
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:48,533
避開他們的拳頭 找到他們的弱點
Dodging their punches. Find their weak site.

854
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:52,512
我們再來幾套拳擊 好嗎
Let's go a couple of hits. Okay?

855
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:53,774
再來試試
No let's try that again.

856
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:54,964
真是太刺激了
This is exciting.

857
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,622
曲妮
Yeah, Trini!

858
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:01,634
準備好了嗎 比利大師
Ready, master Billy?

859
00:57:03,418 --> 00:57:06,200
你需要學會出人意料
You need to learn the element of surprise.

860
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,408
-準備好了嗎 再來一次  -好的
- Ready? Let's go again. - Okay.

861
00:57:08,576 --> 00:57:10,432
比利 腳步要輕
Billy, light on your feet.

862
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:12,846
手舉高
Hands up.

863
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:25,576
激情一點 動起來
Play with some energy now! let's go!

864
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:32,544
集中注意力 所有人都集中注意力
Focus! focus everybody just focus!

865
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:37,181
這招不錯
Lucky shot.

866
00:57:39,565 --> 00:57:41,847
你們都知道自己可能會被謀殺的對吧
You guys all know you can be murdered, right?

867
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:56,436
不
No.

868
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,344
你們必須形成自己的面具 來匹配這幅盔甲
You must shade your own mask to wear this armor.

869
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,739
我什麼都感受不到
I don't feel anything!

870
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,989
不
No.

871
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:09,610
帶他們去訓練場
Take them down to the pit.

872
00:58:09,832 --> 00:58:10,832
看著我
Watch me.

873
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,556
潛行 抓住 抬起
Slip, grab, lift!

874
00:58:14,346 --> 00:58:15,594
Yeah!

875
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,719
潛行 抓住 抬起
Slip, grab, lift!

876
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:20,878
漂亮
Yes!

877
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,950
我們應該成立一個樂隊
<b><i>We SHOULD start a band</i></b>

878
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:44,158
互相想著對方 變身電網就會為你們打開
Think only of each other and the morphing grid will open to you.

879
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:46,068
成功了嗎
It's working?

880
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,345
-不 沒有  -加油
- No, it's not. - Come on!

881
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:49,489
再努力一點
Try harder!

882
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:53,628
我一直都很專注 然而
I have been concentrated though.

883
00:58:53,928 --> 00:58:56,205
我們需要做的就是集中注意力
All we need to do is just concentrate...

884
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:58,874
-別再告訴我集中注意力了  -按我說的做
- Don't tell me to concentrate. - Just follow my lead.

885
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,927
-我們別再內訌了  -現在不是時候
- Let's not fight with each other. - Now is not the time.

886
00:59:05,072 --> 00:59:07,156
走吧 我們去訓練
Come on. Let's go to train.

887
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,574
我們可以分析出水晶位置的信息
The information we need to triangulate the location of...

888
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:13,545
在戰鬥中丟失了
The Crystal was lost in the battle.

889
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:15,153
比利 你在聽嗎
Billy Are you listening to me?

890
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:16,927
比利 你在做什麼
Billy What are you doing?

891
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,181
比利
Billy!

892
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:22,456
水晶在哪 找到他 比利 找到他
Where is the crystal Find him, Billy, find him.

893
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,593
水晶在哪
Where is the crystal?

894
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:26,134
就是那
There.

895
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:29,272
向北17度
17 degrees north...

896
00:59:29,824 --> 00:59:31,611
嘿 傻子 沒長眼睛嗎
Hey, idiot, watch where you're going.

897
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,561
卡卡圈坊
Krispy Kreme DOUGHNUTS

898
00:59:40,662 --> 00:59:44,267
兩位漁民今天在聖安德魯斯公墓下葬
Two fishermen were led to rest today at St Andrews cemetery.

899
00:59:44,368 --> 00:59:47,013
天使園的居民都震驚了
Residents of Angel Grove are feeling the shock.

900
00:59:47,214 --> 00:59:49,282
恐懼蔓延了整個鎮子
Fear has the town on edge.

901
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:52,533
這個連環殺人犯也使警方十分困惑
The series of murders has police baffled...

902
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:55,396
警方發現每個案發現場都伴隨著黃金丟失
as police have linked the loss of gold to each crime scene.

903
00:59:55,772 --> 01:00:00,082
天使園的黃金殺人犯仍然在逃
What is now being Angel Grove's gold killer is still on the loose/.

904
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:02,358
如果麗塔成功創造了天狼將軍
If Rita manages to create Goldar...

905
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:04,039
你們在聽我說話嗎
Are you listening to me?

906
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:06,243
如果他從地裡搶出了水晶
And he rips the crystal from the ground..

907
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:09,744
那將會像是一萬個核彈同時摧毀地球
..It will be like ten thousand nuclear bombs washing over earth.

908
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:11,236
我們應該感到害怕嗎
That supposed to freak us out?

909
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:13,528
我們讓這越來越困難了 都累的像驢一樣
We keep making this harder. We are busting our asses,

910
01:00:13,729 --> 01:00:14,885
是不是該給我們扔個骨頭鼓勵下
Feel free to throw us a bone at some point.

911
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:17,633
我也看得出你們累的像驢一樣
Yes, I see you busting your asses.

912
01:00:17,884 --> 01:00:19,903
所以我決定給你們一點鼓舞士氣的東西
So I've decided to give you some inspiration.

913
01:00:20,405 --> 01:00:24,180
這面牆後面的東西將永遠改變你們的生活
What you will find beyond this wall will forever change your life.

914
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,998
來吧
Come on.

915
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,481
-戰鬥恐龍 超帥的 對吧  -是啊
- The Zords! Pretty cool, right? - Yeah.

916
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:36,817
他們以地球上最強大的生物為原型
They take on the form of most powerful organism on the planet.

917
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:40,953
當這些戰鬥恐龍形成的時候 恐龍是地球霸主
When these Zords formed, dinosaurs reigned supreme.

918
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,166
他們將是你們的擴展裝備
They will be an extension of you.

919
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:47,300
他們的力量是無窮的
And there power is all but limitless.

920
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,793
真是太難以置信了
They are incredible.

921
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:53,170
但你們還沒準備好接收這種力量
But you are not ready for this power.

922
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:57,156
當你們變身後 你們的盔甲將為你們每人匹配一個戰鬥恐龍
When you morph, your armor will make you one with the zords.

923
01:00:57,356 --> 01:00:59,097
來吧 我們去訓練吧
Come on. Let's go train.

924
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:01,394
今天就是你們成為超凡勇士的日子
Today is the day you become Rangers!

925
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:02,842
我能預感到
I can feel it!

926
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:05,451
好吧
Okay.

927
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:06,653
我們走
Let's go.

928
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:07,752
Yeah.

929
01:01:08,388 --> 01:01:09,590
走吧
Let's go.

930
01:01:16,905 --> 01:01:19,127
真是個糟糕的主意
This was a bad idea. Okay, okay.

931
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:21,641
信號呢 剎車呢 剎車 我需要剎車
Signals, brakes. Brakes, I need the brakes!

932
01:01:21,742 --> 01:01:23,341
手動操作 手動操作
Manual. Manual.

933
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,718
剎車在哪 阿爾法5號
Where are the breaks. Alpha 5?

934
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:32,645
天啊 讓開 讓開
Oh, God hey, Move! Move!

935
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:33,935
讓開
Out of the way!

936
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:39,674
□ Oh, Tailing on the mountain. □

937
01:01:41,585 --> 01:01:45,010
在你們記住今天的訓練課程後 有個很重要的事
After you remember that today's train lesson the important thing is to...

938
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,610
等等 查克在哪
Wait. Where is Zack?

939
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:47,712
講真嗎
Seriously?

940
01:01:50,454 --> 01:01:53,233
快跑 快跑
Run, run! Run!

941
01:01:53,787 --> 01:01:56,005
跑啊 跑啊
Run! Run!

942
01:01:58,512 --> 01:02:00,247
糟糕了
It's bad!

943
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:08,860
你們還好嗎
You're alright?

944
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:16,575
沒事 我的錯 這是我的錯
Alright, my bad, my bad. That's on me right there.

945
01:02:16,678 --> 01:02:17,753
你有病吧
What's your problem?

946
01:02:17,823 --> 01:02:19,972
你差點殺了你自己 還有我們
You could've killed yourself, or us.

947
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,834
-讓開 老大  -嘿
- Back off, boss. - Hey!

948
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:24,359
夥計們 小心點
No, Come on guys. Wow.

949
01:02:24,758 --> 01:02:26,879
-夥計們 別打了  -小心點
- Guys, guys, come on. - Watch it.

950
01:02:26,982 --> 01:02:28,422
等等 你們在做什麼
Wait. What are you doing?

951
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,570
拜託你們別打了
Stop fighting, please!

952
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:44,221
怎麼了
What?

953
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:46,891
站著別動
Stand still.

954
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:49,159
怎麼了 啥玩意在我臉上
What? I got something on my face...?

955
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,660
Yeah!

956
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:54,358
-太酷了  -是啊
- Ok, now that's cool! - Oh, Yeah!

957
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:56,290
別碰它 查克 別碰它
Don't touch it. Zack, don't touch it.

958
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,322
查克 別碰
Zack, do not touch.

959
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:02,352
它去哪了
Where'd it go?

960
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:04,738
再來一次 再來一次 哥們
Bring it back, bring it back, dude.

961
01:03:05,107 --> 01:03:06,198
出去
Get out.

962
01:03:06,397 --> 01:03:09,957
今天的訓練結束了 你們回家吧
The training is over for today. Go home.

963
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:13,404
抱歉 他剛才變身了 真的 你也看到了對吧
I'm sorry, he just morphed. He did it. You saw it, right?

964
01:03:13,505 --> 01:03:15,577
那就再做一次 所有人都是
Do it again. All of you.

965
01:03:17,179 --> 01:03:20,460
-比利 你是怎麼做到的  -比利 再來一次
- Billy, how'd you do that? - Come on, Billy, let's do it.

966
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,120
來吧 再來一次
Come on, do it again.

967
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:28,191
-再來一次  -我正在努力 我集中不了注意力
- Do it again. - I'm trying. I can't focus

968
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:31,108
比利 你是怎麼做到的 給我們看看
Billy, how'd you do it? Show us.

969
01:03:32,963 --> 01:03:34,735
好吧 我們不知道怎麼變的
Okay, we don't know how.

970
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:36,136
不出我所料
That's what I thought.

971
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:39,904
如果你們不能變身 那就不是超凡勇士
If you can't morph, You are not Rangers.

972
01:03:40,105 --> 01:03:42,198
你們都回家吧
Go home, all of you.

973
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,030
現在怎麼辦
Now what?

974
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:47,259
-該死  -真的嗎
- Got damn! - Seriously?

975
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,302
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

976
01:03:56,502 --> 01:03:59,876
我今晚要待在這
Guys. Look, I'mma stay up here tonight.

977
01:03:59,978 --> 01:04:03,920
生個火 如果你們也想留下的話 我帶了充足的食物
Make a fire, I got some food. If you guys wanna stay

978
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:06,499
我留下
I'm down.

979
01:04:08,091 --> 01:04:09,091
好吧
Alright.

980
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:10,174
很好
Cool.

981
01:04:10,523 --> 01:04:12,853
傑森沒有通過試驗
Jason's failing experiment.

982
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:14,906
我應該自己摧毀麗塔的
I shall destroy Rita myself.

983
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:17,609
肯定還有辦法能把我從這個牆裡救出來
There must be a way to free me from this wall.

984
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:22,247
是的 但諷刺的是 你需要這些勇士變身
Yes, but the irony is that you need these rangers to morph.

985
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:24,641
如果他們變身了 你才能吸收他們的能量
If they morph, you can harness that energy...

986
01:04:24,642 --> 01:04:26,960
來重生你的身體 你才能回到現實
to regenerate your body and come back through.

987
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:29,210
不 肯定還有辦法的 我不能…
No, there's got to another way! I can't...

988
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:31,813
不能什麼 佐籐 你不能什麼
What, Zordon? You can't what?

989
01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:35,456
等著我們這些蠢小孩變身後 你就好復活了是嗎
Wait for us dumb kids to morph so that you can come back to life.

990
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:37,356
你一直就是為了這個 是吧
That's what all this has been about, right?

991
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,222
你會回來嗎
You coming back?

992
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,099
這一切都是為了保護水晶
This has only ever been about to protecting the crystal

993
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:44,359
在我們談話的時候 麗塔可能已經在製造天狼將軍了
Rita could be building Goldar as we speak.

994
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,391
別低估了我 也別低估了我的團隊
Don't underestimate me or my team.

995
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:47,821
你們阻止不了他
You can't stop him..

996
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:52,725
她會讓他挖出水晶 地球上的所有生命都會死
She will have him dig up the crystal and life on earth..will die.

997
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,243
我們需要你
And we need you.

998
01:04:54,844 --> 01:04:57,430
因為你上次成功的阻止了她
Because you were so successful in stopping her last time.

999
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:00,203
我死的時候 埋葬了這些硬幣
I died burying those coins...

1000
01:05:00,404 --> 01:05:03,941
希望他們能找到下任超凡勇士
In hopes they will find next real Rangers.

1001
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,838
那些當之無愧的人
Those who are worthy.

1002
01:05:06,038 --> 01:05:07,791
抱歉我們讓你失望了
I'm sorry to disappoint you!

1003
01:05:07,892 --> 01:05:10,526
我不需要站在這 讓你來告訴我 我到底做錯了什麼
I don't need to stand here and have you tell me what I did wrong.

1004
01:05:10,727 --> 01:05:12,031
我可以自己回家想明白
I can go home and get that.

1005
01:05:12,134 --> 01:05:15,920
傑森 你必須把我從這面牆中釋放出來
Jason! You need me out of this wall.

1006
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:17,970
來幫你領導這個隊伍
To help lead this team!

1007
01:05:18,269 --> 01:05:19,700
你的團隊已經覆滅了
Your team is dead.

1008
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:22,832
你只是跟我們一樣害怕罷了
And you're just as scared as we are.

1009
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:33,267
這些都是24K黃金製造的
These are off 24 carat Gold.

1010
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:34,692
我很快就來
I'll be right with you.

1011
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,207
你真是太可愛了
You're so sweet.

1012
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:49,788
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

1013
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:55,126
有什麼可以幫你嗎
Can I help you?

1014
01:05:56,348 --> 01:05:57,348
黃金
Gold.

1015
01:05:58,597 --> 01:06:00,634
我對金子
I'm interested...

1016
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:02,390
很有興趣
gold.

1017
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:04,241
好的
Yeah.

1018
01:06:09,247 --> 01:06:12,182
我們這裡有些非常棒的首飾
We have some very nice pieces here.

1019
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:28,473
靠近點
Come closer.

1020
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,325
再近點 近點
Closer, closer. Closer.

1021
01:06:38,173 --> 01:06:39,257
這個
This.

1022
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:40,965
把這個給我
Give it to me!

1023
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:42,589
好的 給你
Okay. There you go.

1024
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,387
生長吧
Grow.

1025
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,255
生長吧
Grow.

1026
01:07:04,614 --> 01:07:06,016
我是警察 不許動
Police! Don't move!

1027
01:07:06,478 --> 01:07:10,889
放下你的武器 舉起雙手 趕緊的
Drop it, weapon, put your hands on your head. Do it Now!

1028
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:12,235
請照做 這位女士
Do it, I say, lady!

1029
01:07:12,336 --> 01:07:13,435
女士
Lady?

1030
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:16,066
我喜歡你叫我女士
I like the sound of lady.

1031
01:07:16,184 --> 01:07:18,391
趴到地上 以防你受傷
Get on the ground and you won't get hurt.

1032
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:32,876
第五小組 鳳凰珠寶這裡需要支援
Unit 5, I need backup at Jewelers Phoenix.

1033
01:07:33,018 --> 01:07:35,317
我已經開槍 重複 已開槍
Shots were fired. I repeat, shots were fired.

1034
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:37,567
趴下
Down!

1035
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:49,824
自從我養育我美麗的生物已經過去很久了
It's been too long since I raised my beautiful creatures.

1036
01:07:52,192 --> 01:07:54,130
你們想我了沒
Did you miss me?

1037
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:04,459
噢 天啊
Oh my God.

1038
01:08:04,658 --> 01:08:06,058
殺了他
Kill him.

1039
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:11,826
-好吧  -哈哈
- Alright. - Ha-ha.

1040
01:08:12,128 --> 01:08:15,571
我怎麼會卡在這個牆裡 我會跳出去的
"How we are stuck in this wall I will make that jump."

1041
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:19,111
那裡面發生了什麼
What happened back there?

1042
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:21,604
沒什麼 別擔心
Nothing, don't worry about it.

1043
01:08:24,557 --> 01:08:26,000
比利 你怎麼做到的
Billy, how'd you do it?

1044
01:08:27,211 --> 01:08:28,647
你是怎麼變身的
How'd you morph?

1045
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:30,313
我不知道
I don't know.

1046
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:33,429
要不我們讓他再試一次變身
What do you guys saying him about one more trying to morph?

1047
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:37,522
你們必須形成自己的面具 來匹配這個盔甲
"You must shade your masks to wear this armor."

1048
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:44,048
想著隊伍中的各位 變形電網就會為你們打開
"Think only of each other and the morphin' grid will open to you".

1049
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:45,440
你學的更像
Yeah, that's better.

1050
01:08:46,212 --> 01:08:48,807
會不會因為我們都不互相熟悉
Or maybe it's Cause we don't know each other.

1051
01:08:48,877 --> 01:08:50,764
也許這就是我們不能變身的原因
Maybe that's why we can't morph.

1052
01:08:52,969 --> 01:08:53,969
好吧
Okay.

1053
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:57,951
不 我是認真的 我們來真正的試試吧
No, I am serious, let's do this for real

1054
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:02,075
我是查克 我是一名超凡勇士
I am Jack and I am a Power Ranger.

1055
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:06,437
-嗨 查克   -嗨 查克
- Hi, Zack. - Hi, Zack.

1056
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:08,024
真的
True

1057
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:11,596
我住在梅洛迪移動家庭公園
I live in the Melody mobile home park.

1058
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:13,794
只有我和我媽媽
It's just me and my mum.

1059
01:09:14,394 --> 01:09:15,572
而我媽媽
And my mom?

1060
01:09:16,272 --> 01:09:18,329
我媽媽是最棒的
My mom is the best!

1061
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:24,598
但是我媽媽 她病了
But my Mom. she's sick.

1062
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:26,959
我做了能做的一切
I do what I can...

1063
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,603
但我還是很害怕
but I'm scared.

1064
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,261
有時候我太害怕了 不願意在家過夜
Sometimes I get too scared to stay the night

1065
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,939
因為我害怕她撐不過一夜
because I'm afraid she can't make it.

1066
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:40,587
如果她死了
And if she goes...

1067
01:09:42,465 --> 01:09:43,921
當她死了
When she goes...

1068
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:47,329
我就再沒有別人了
I got nobody else.

1069
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,519
聽著
Look.

1070
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:55,824
我覺得能認識你們我很幸福
I think being with you guys is good for me.

1071
01:09:58,456 --> 01:09:59,166
我們繼續吧
Let's do that.

1072
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,172
我們都說出自己的秘密 會有效果的
Let's tell our secrets it will help us.

1073
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,463
好吧 我也有個秘密
Okay, I got a secret.

1074
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:07,869
-我喜歡鄉村音樂  -什麼
- I like country music. - What?

1075
01:10:08,214 --> 01:10:10,366
事實上 我熱愛鄉村音樂
As a matter of fact, I love country music.

1076
01:10:12,362 --> 01:10:13,448
我不…
And I don't...

1077
01:10:14,632 --> 01:10:16,432
我不是那麼想念我爸爸
I don't miss my dad that much

1078
01:10:18,765 --> 01:10:21,187
我跟他在一起的時光都是在礦裡
I mean coming to the mine with him was all I had.

1079
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:26,277
但是 跟你們一起來礦上 也是一樣幸福的
But.. coming to the mine with you guys is just as good.

1080
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,680
就是這樣
Yeah.

1081
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,004
最大的秘密是 你為什麼會進拘留所
Biggest secret is why're you in detention.

1082
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,252
-我炸了我的午餐盒  -什麼
- I blew up my lunch box. - What?

1083
01:10:33,378 --> 01:10:34,872
那只是個意外
But it was an accident.

1084
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:36,591
-什麼  -當然了
- What? - Of course.

1085
01:10:36,878 --> 01:10:38,136
我的午餐盒在我的儲存櫃裡
My lunch box was in my locker

1086
01:10:38,137 --> 01:10:40,668
炸彈炸了午餐盒 所以比利就進了拘留所
boom goes the lunch box, in detention goes Billy.

1087
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:43,116
別忘了金伯莉·哈爾特
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart

1088
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:44,941
也是在拘留所裡的
was also in detention too so...

1089
01:10:47,797 --> 01:10:48,797
今晚我不想說
Not tonight.

1090
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:51,361
跳過我吧
Skip me.

1091
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:56,110
那你呢 哥們
What about you dude?

1092
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:58,825
你為什麼不告訴我們你到底是誰
Why don't you tell us who you really are?

1093
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:01,318
因為所有人都知道我是誰
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.

1094
01:11:01,786 --> 01:11:02,913
好吧
Okay.

1095
01:11:03,879 --> 01:11:05,447
那你呢 瘋狂的姑娘
What about you, crazy girl?

1096
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:08,191
如果你們信我 我就告訴你們我的一切
I could tell you anything and you would have to believe me.

1097
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,235
好
Okay.

1098
01:11:15,528 --> 01:11:16,899
我是新來的姑娘
I'm the new girl.

1099
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:18,620
總是如此
Always.

1100
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:22,336
三年換了三個學校
Three schools in three years.

1101
01:11:24,525 --> 01:11:27,450
我也喜歡這樣的生活方式 這樣更輕鬆
I like it that way, you know, it's just easier.

1102
01:11:27,657 --> 01:11:29,945
沒人曾經真正瞭解過我
Nobody ever has to get to know me...

1103
01:11:30,262 --> 01:11:33,783
我父母根本不用擔心我談戀愛
my parents don't have to worry about my relationships.

1104
01:11:35,364 --> 01:11:36,748
男朋友的事嗎
Boyfriend troubles?

1105
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:37,981
是的
Yeah.

1106
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,756
男朋友的麻煩事
Boyfriend troubles.

1107
01:11:43,744 --> 01:11:45,174
還是女朋友的麻煩事
Girlfriend troubles.?

1108
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:53,779
我的家庭很正常
My family is so normal.

1109
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:55,973
過於正常了
Too normal.

1110
01:11:58,757 --> 01:12:00,658
他們相信每個人都有自己的標籤
They believe in labels.

1111
01:12:02,743 --> 01:12:04,993
他們會想讓我…
They would like for me to...

1112
01:12:06,092 --> 01:12:07,471
穿的不一樣
dress differently.

1113
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:10,005
多講話
Talk more.

1114
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:14,540
想我交很多他們喜歡的那種朋友
Have the kinds of friends they want me to have.

1115
01:12:16,853 --> 01:12:19,986
我不知道怎麼告訴他們我到底怎麼了
I don't know how to tell them what's really going on with me.

1116
01:12:24,954 --> 01:12:27,461
我從來沒把這些事說出來
I never said any of this out loud.

1117
01:12:27,703 --> 01:12:30,621
沒事 你現在有我們了
Well, it's cool. You with us now.

1118
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:34,407
是嗎
Am I?

1119
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:37,262
這意味著什麼呢
What does that mean?

1120
01:12:37,874 --> 01:12:39,551
當這一切都結束了
When all this is over?

1121
01:12:40,413 --> 01:12:42,275
我們還是超凡勇士嗎
Are we Power Rangers or?

1122
01:12:44,877 --> 01:12:47,033
我們還是朋友嗎
Are we friends?

1123
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:14,344
你知道我是誰嗎
Do you know who I am?

1124
01:13:16,495 --> 01:13:17,537
是的
Yes.

1125
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,122
我曾經也和你一樣
I was once just like you.

1126
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:24,709
如此漂亮
So pretty.

1127
01:13:25,294 --> 01:13:26,816
無辜
Innocent.

1128
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:31,375
佐籐的新超凡戰隊成員都跟你一樣年輕嗎
Are all the rangers on Zordan's new team as young as you?

1129
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:34,766
真是令人愉快
Delightful!

1130
01:13:36,273 --> 01:13:37,807
你變過身了嗎
Have you morphed yet?

1131
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:42,167
偏題了
Trick question.

1132
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,862
如果你能變身的話
If you could morph,

1133
01:13:43,932 --> 01:13:47,702
那我們的對話就會變得完全不同了
we would be having a very different conversation.

1134
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,793
黃色超凡勇士
The Yellow Ranger.

1135
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:54,740
我該殺了你嗎
Should I kill you?

1136
01:13:55,408 --> 01:13:58,763
我曾經可是殺過黃色超凡勇士的
I killed the yellow Ranger before.

1137
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,367
我喜歡這樣
And I loved it!

1138
01:14:01,722 --> 01:14:04,006
你想要得到你的盔甲
Oh, you want your armor.

1139
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:08,387
如果你給我看你的盔甲 我也給你看我的
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

1140
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,425
不 求你了 你弄疼我了
No, please, you're hurting me.

1141
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:26,806
你這麼強壯
You are so strong!

1142
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:30,853
我只是開玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

1143
01:14:32,494 --> 01:14:35,008
你真是膽大包天 小黃黃
You've guts full, little yellow!

1144
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:36,716
我在你身上看到了我自己
I see myself in you.

1145
01:14:36,994 --> 01:14:40,610
我在佐籐的隊伍裡也是個外人 就像你一樣
I was an outsider on Zordan's team, just like you.

1146
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:43,626
我需要知道的就是
All I need to know is...

1147
01:14:44,137 --> 01:14:45,977
奇奧水晶在哪
where is the Zeo Crystal.

1148
01:14:46,043 --> 01:14:47,936
我不知道
I don't know.

1149
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:50,424
很可惜 我相信你
Sadly, I believe you.

1150
01:14:50,873 --> 01:14:54,149
明天我就要毀了天使園
Tomorrow I am going to destroy Angel Grove.

1151
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:57,149
但是作為你生命的交換籌碼
But in exchange for your life...

1152
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:01,147
你可以找到那個水晶後來找我
you will find out where that crystal is and you will come to me.

1153
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:04,987
我們可以來個小交易 我的朋友 嘀嘀
We can have a little deal, Didi my friend.

1154
01:15:18,349 --> 01:15:19,911
-金  -是我
- Kim! - It's me.

1155
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:22,565
你怎麼進來的
How did you get in here?

1156
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:26,396
我是個超級英雄 你的窗戶也是開著的
I am a super hero. And you left your window open.

1157
01:15:26,589 --> 01:15:27,589
一切都還好嗎
So everything okay?

1158
01:15:29,099 --> 01:15:31,727
我想我應該就是我們不能變身的原因
I think I'm the reason we can't morph.

1159
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,341
我沒有對你們誠懇
I haven't really been honest.

1160
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:36,565
好吧
Okay.

1161
01:15:36,621 --> 01:15:38,722
我在泰·弗萊明的臉上打了一拳
I punched Ty Fleming on the face...

1162
01:15:38,813 --> 01:15:41,890
因為他告訴別人 我是他遇到過的最卑鄙的人
because he told everyone I was the meanest person he ever met.

1163
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:43,740
他說的對
And he was right.

1164
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:46,162
-不可能  -好吧
- That cannot be true. - Okay.

1165
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:49,273
Whoa!

1166
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:51,101
-就是這樣   -是你拍的這個照片嗎
- Yeah. - You took that picture?

1167
01:15:51,328 --> 01:15:54,707
不 阿曼達·克拉克拍的 她自己的照片
No. Amanda Clark, took that picture, of herself.

1168
01:15:55,223 --> 01:15:57,897
她私底下跟我分享過這個照片
But she shared it with me privately.

1169
01:15:58,653 --> 01:15:59,914
她信任我
She trusted me.

1170
01:16:00,001 --> 01:16:02,374
而你卻把照片發給了泰？
And you sent that pic to Ty?

1171
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:04,331
還附帶著一段話
With a text that said.

1172
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,972
你想帶回家見媽媽的是不是就是這個姑娘？
"Is this the girl you wanna bring home to your mom?"

1173
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:11,989
在我看到她的臉之前 我都不知道這有多卑鄙
I did not know how mean it was until I saw her face.

1174
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,911
金 不誇張的說 整個學校裡每天都有上千張照片傳來傳去
Kim, there is literally thousands of photos going around school

1175
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:17,411
我不在乎他們 我只在乎這個照片
I don't care about them. I care about this.

1176
01:16:17,758 --> 01:16:19,108
是我做的
I did this!

1177
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:22,209
我不得不坐在德特梅先生的辦公室 和阿曼達的父親坐在一起
I had to sit in Mr. Detmer's office with Amanda's father...

1178
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,808
看著他們給他看他自己女兒的照片
and watched as they showed him the photo of his daughter.

1179
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:30,306
在他的眼裡 我第一次知道了我到底是成為了什麼樣的人
In his eyes for the first time I could see who I would become.

1180
01:16:30,672 --> 01:16:34,226
所以我撒謊了 我怪罪了所有其他人
You know, So I lied. I blamed everyone else.

1181
01:16:35,661 --> 01:16:37,409
我想去死 這就是為什麼
I wanted to die, that's why...

1182
01:16:37,548 --> 01:16:40,522
你問我要不要一起逃走的時候 我已經準備好了
When you asked me to run away, I was ready.

1183
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:41,900
好吧 聽著
Okay, listen.

1184
01:16:42,194 --> 01:16:44,616
從頭開始 現在就把那些照片清除乾淨
Start over. Erase that picture right now.

1185
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:47,344
-傑森 這不可能清除的  -那就帶著它一起活下去
- Jason, it can't be erased. - Then live with it!

1186
01:16:47,597 --> 01:16:50,717
你做了件很糟糕的事 但並不意味著你是一個糟糕的人
You did an awful thing, that does not make you a awful person.

1187
01:16:54,856 --> 01:16:56,838
成為你自己就好
Just be the person you wanna be.

1188
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:10,483
我們都收到了同樣的信息 她在哪
So we all get the same text. So where is she?

1189
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:14,731
我在這
I'm here!

1190
01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:17,912
聽著
Look.

1191
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:19,813
麗塔今晚來我家找我了
Rita came to my house tonight.

1192
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:21,717
-什麼   -她是真實存在的
- What? - Yeah, she's real.

1193
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:23,782
真是瘋了
Insane.

1194
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:26,116
她差點殺了我
She nearly killed me.

1195
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:30,315
她想讓我加入她 說如果我能保留一個秘密的話
She's trying to get me to join her. She said she'd spare my life

1196
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,438
-她就饒我一命  -什麼秘密
- if kept a secret. - What secret?

1197
01:17:32,532 --> 01:17:35,500
她對天使園的毀滅計劃開始了
Act on the destruction of Angel Grove begins.

1198
01:17:35,636 --> 01:17:38,786
-這些都是真的 末日要來了   -不 不是的 她在哪
- This is real. This is the end. - No, it's not. Where is she?

1199
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:40,976
她說讓我去死人的船上找她
She said to me hear what the dead ships live.

1200
01:17:41,201 --> 01:17:43,437
就是碼頭的那個船塢對吧
That's the boatyard by the docks, right?

1201
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:44,616
我們走吧
Let's go!

1202
01:17:50,342 --> 01:17:51,623
你是認真的嗎
Are you serious?

1203
01:17:52,077 --> 01:17:52,407
沒人要一起嗎
No one?

1204
01:17:52,477 --> 01:17:54,602
傑森 我們甚至還不是超凡勇士
Jason. We are not even power rangers yet.

1205
01:17:54,776 --> 01:17:56,214
要我說 我們回去找佐籐
I say we go back to Zordon.

1206
01:17:56,482 --> 01:18:00,063
好吧 佐籐想我們成為超凡勇士的唯一理由
Ok... The only reason Zordon wanted us to become Power Rangers...

1207
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:01,762
就是這樣他才能復活
Is so that he can come back to life.

1208
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,092
你為什麼這麼說
Why makes you say that?

1209
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:04,416
因為他告訴我的
Because he told me.

1210
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:08,322
-等等 這一切都是謊言？  -當然是謊言了 比利
- Wait, so all this a lie? - Of course it was a lie, Billy.

1211
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:09,785
我們失敗了
We failed.

1212
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,737
別再妄想成為什麼超級英雄戰隊了
Let's stop being delusional about being a team of superheroes.

1213
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,649
我們都是一群爛人
We are all screw-ups.

1214
01:18:16,406 --> 01:18:19,401
我也非常憎恨這個骯髒的垃圾鎮子
And as much as I hate this scrubby bullshit town...

1215
01:18:20,173 --> 01:18:22,798
但我還是不想傻坐著等它被毀滅
I don't wanna just sit around and watch it die okay?

1216
01:18:23,861 --> 01:18:25,528
我們一起去完成這個使命吧
Let's go and do the one this

1217
01:18:25,598 --> 01:18:27,861
殺死麗塔吧
that's been asked of us and kill Rita.

1218
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:34,221
你知道這不是個好主意 對吧
You know this is really a bad idea, right?

1219
01:18:34,362 --> 01:18:35,362
最糟糕的主意
The worst.

1220
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:37,565
我們投票吧
Let's vote.

1221
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,487
舉起你們的手
Shove hands.

1222
01:18:55,972 --> 01:18:57,314
我們出發吧
Let's do it.

1223
01:19:26,923 --> 01:19:27,923
好
Okay.

1224
01:19:28,318 --> 01:19:29,318
很好
Okay.

1225
01:19:30,136 --> 01:19:31,388
我們走
Let's go.

1226
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,531
-你們去左邊 我們去右邊  -明白
- take the left, take the right. - Got it.

1227
01:19:42,303 --> 01:19:43,382
我們會給你鬆綁的 堅持住
We'll untie. Hold it.

1228
01:19:43,452 --> 01:19:45,765
不 不 我們考慮一下好嗎
No no. Let's just think about this, okay?

1229
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:47,648
該死
Oh shit.

1230
01:19:52,585 --> 01:19:54,566
來的正是時候
Right on time.

1231
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,699
剛才我還在想 你們會不會太蠢了
I was beginning to think you were too dumb

1232
01:19:57,769 --> 01:19:59,851
以至於不知道死人船在哪

1233
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:03,838
開始遊戲吧

五個小超凡勇士像魚一樣被綁起來

黃色勇士已經將你們帶向了死亡

因為我會殺了你們
Because I'm going to kill you...

1241
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,933
一個接一個 直到你告訴我

1242
01:21:02,474 --> 01:21:03,894
水晶在哪

但是你猜怎麼著
But guess what.

1247
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:12,216
你們中的一個肯定知道
One of you does.

1248
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:14,877
那會是誰呢
Who could it be?

1249
01:21:15,543 --> 01:21:18,216
我來猜猜
Eeinie meenie mynie...

1250

Or you can tell me after I kill all of your friends.

1257

卡卡圈坊
It's a Krispy Kreme.

1267

卡卡圈坊？

卡卡圈坊 真是個特殊的地方

我幫不了你們
There is nothing that I could do for him.

1303
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:07,643
沒有自己的戰隊 我們都無能為力
We were both reckless with our teams.

1304
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:14,940

1310
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:38,544
像平常一樣 我又做出了錯誤的決定
And as usual, I made the wrong decision.

1311
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:41,281
出於恐懼 出於憤怒
Out of fear, anger...

1312
01:25:42,685 --> 01:25:45,430
我不知道 我就是太憤怒了
I don't know, It's just so angry.

1313

他是個好孩子 你知道的

1316
01:25:59,277 --> 01:26:00,869
對不起 比利
I'm sorry, Billy.

1317
01:26:02,735 --> 01:26:05,133
如果可以 我想用我自己的命換你的
I'll trade my life for yours if I could.

1318
01:26:15,205 --> 01:26:17,626
也許他是為了我們付出了自己的生命
Maybe he traded his life for us.

1319
01:26:18,535 --> 01:26:20,211
也許是的
Yeah probably he did.

1320
01:26:26,558 --> 01:26:27,737

I would.

1321
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:31,671

Me too.

01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,446
只剩我們四個了
Just the four of us now.

1325
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,053
事實是
The truth is...

1326
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,332
無論我們之間互相說了什麼
whatever we've said to each other...

1327
01:26:54,068 --> 01:26:55,400
都無所謂了
It does not matter.

1328
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:57,811
這個
This...

1329
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:00,695
這些才是我們最要緊的事
this is the only thing that matters.

1330
01:27:04,413 --> 01:27:05,413
她說的對
She is right.

1331
01:27:11,163 --> 01:27:12,190

我不知道他在哪
I don't know where he is.

1347
01:27:57,982 --> 01:27:58,982
佐籐 怎麼了
Zordan, what?

1348
01:27:59,519 --> 01:28:02,327
為什麼你沒有走過來 那是你唯一的機會
Why didn't you step through? That was your only chance.

1349

是的

1576
01:50:06,844 --> 01:50:08,067
很奇怪吧
Weird right?

1577

我不認為他能看到我
I don't think he can see me.

1586
01:51:15,499 --> 01:51:17,044
跳的不錯 傑森
Nice willow, Jason.

1587

你自己贏來的
You've earned it.
