1
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,887
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,182
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,064
Alpha, I'm the last one left.

4
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,359
We must stop her!

5
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:54,197
Send the meteor to my coordinates.

6
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:02,122
Seek only those who are worthy.

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,794
Find only those who are strong.

8
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:17,137
With the Zeo Crystal,
we could have rulled the universe together.

9
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,848
That was never going to happen.

10
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,810
And because of that you will die, Zordon.

11
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,230
We will die together, Rita.

12
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:51,214
Where are we, Alpha?

13
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,591
I'm glad to hear your voice, Zordon!

14
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,427
I can see you, Alpha.

15
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,886
But I cannot see myself.

16
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,972
Where I'm I?

17
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,974
You are inside of the ship.

18
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,892
Everything is fine.

19
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:06,521
I saved your mind in to the machine.

20
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:13,278
Is the spaceship working?

21
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,697
The power coins have finally returned to the ship.

22
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:22,120
Where are the coins?

23
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,081
Where are the Rangers?

24
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,923
They speak in a foreign language called english.

25
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:37,260
You will find more about it
on the machines matrix core.

26
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:08,485
Yesterday you came home very late.

27
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:13,406
Take it easy, mom.
Lay down and rest.

28
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,203
I'm glad you here.

29
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:20,288
Are you going to school?

30
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,292
I want an awsner.

31
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:27,796
Make sure you take them.

32
01:52:22,701 --> 01:52:25,286
They were five. They were warriors.

33
01:52:25,328 --> 01:52:28,206
They saved Angel Grove.

34
01:52:28,873 --> 01:52:30,375
Five warriors?

35
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:32,544
Were they good looking?
