1
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,960
My name is David Kruipen.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
"What is sacrifice?

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,480
What does it mean
to make a real difference?

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,520
Throughout my life and career,
I have straddled two worlds.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
Increasingly I have become...

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
...respected.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Increasingly my books
and articles...

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,320
...are published and read.

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,800
Increasingly I have been
embraced by policymakers...

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,160
...and referenced by bureaucrats...

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,840
...but today I realized...

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
...that I have...

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,920
...misguided myself.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,960
Today I rediscovered...

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,160
...what I knew
when I was young. "

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
- Is that one on her forehead?
- I can't look.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,800
Jesus Christ!

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,560
I know.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,440
You said it was a tick.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
- Um, I don't know if it was a tick.
- It's not a tick.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
- It was a bug.
- It hurts.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,000
I know, sweetheart,
but I need you to stay still.

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,280
Okay, it's just about there.
Hold on, hold on.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,160
Hold on.
Okay okay.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Okay, there, Doug,
do you see that?

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,080
- Jesus.
- What?

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,400
- See those hairs?
- Get the tweezers, the tweezers.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,640
I want you to grab it. Honey,
keep your head still, please.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,440
- Get back in so I can see it.
- What?

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
Get... Just...

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
Shit.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,240
What do I do?
What do I do?

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,160
We have to do something
about the population.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,640
- And what is wrong with the population?
- We have too many people.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
There's way too many people
using way too much stuff.

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,000
That's why we have
global warming.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,480
They will tell you
that we are on the verge...

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,760
...of imminent destruction.
The carbon dioxide in the air...

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,520
...is gonna turn our atmosphere
into a microwave...

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
...and we're all gonna burn and die.

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,040
What a load of crap.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,560
I don't care what they say.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,560
It's not a glacial meltdown
or anything like that.

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
For decades
we've been warned.

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,520
Global warming is definitely real
and it's potentially catastrophic.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
I believe it's prophecy
being fulfilled...

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
...hard times that's spoken
about in the Bible.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,160
Global warming is
becoming a religion...

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,280
...for some of these...
for some of these loonies.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,320
Of course there's global warming
and of course it's man-made.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,480
It's a hoax.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,920
The melting Arctic will
reveal a frightening truth.

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,560
I don't think that people are
going to do enough in time.

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,240
We're on the brink of Armageddon.
Most of us will die.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,520
The few of us who survive will be...

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,520
...living in a world like Somalia.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
And what can we do about it?

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,840
We make small sacrifices,
but the real ones that really matter...

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,200
- The world will change, I don't think.
- Ever.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,280
What does it mean to make
a real difference?

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,680
...radical environmentalists and
clearly a legitimate terrorist threat.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,200
When non-violent
methods fail to...

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,320
...change people's minds
quickly enough...

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,520
...well, we have to consider
other options.

65
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,040
- The time is now.
- We have a breaking story.

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,160
It's spreading quickly
and hospitals cannot keep up.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,280
Thousands are violently ill,
hundreds dead.

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
There is complete chaos
in the streets.

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,240
400 people have died.
At least 10,000 are infected.

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,560
State troopers and the National Guard
were ordered to seal off all borders...

71
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
...as people
are trying to flee.

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,240
When nature is the terrorist...

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,520
We're gonna... we're gonna die.

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,280
It's too late to do anything.

75
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,280
Die, I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die!

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm gonna... Help me!

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,880
One of the horrors...

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
The worst bioterrorism
we've ever known.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh my God!

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm dead!

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,920
David!

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,680
A couple hundred pounds
underweight.

83
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,720
He must have traveled far.

84
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
The teeth... only two years old.

85
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,440
He probably tried to swim...

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,640
...off island, had to come back.

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,920
Not enough ice.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,920
What's he saying?

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,320
He's saying get
the fuck over here.

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
What did you find, man?

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,600
What is it?

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Manalu.

93
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,440
The pine beetle is
just one example...

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,200
...of the profound impact
global warming is having on the planet.

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,800
The truth is our way of life
is leaving the door open...

96
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,720
...to an infinite number
of threats...

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
...equally as pernicious
as the tiny pine beetle.

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,120
We're not going to see an end
to this sort of horror...

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
...unless sacrifices are made.

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,120
And that's all for now.

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Now as you know, a few
of you will have the honor...

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
...of joining the renown
Dr. Kruipen and his team...

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,720
...studying the impact
of global warming...

104
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,320
...on polar bears.

105
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Atom Galen...

106
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Federico Fulce...

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,120
...and Ling Chen.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,880
- Yes, Atom?
- I thought four students were going.

109
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,320
So did I. Unfortunately
that is no longer the case.

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Jesus Christ!

111
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,680
You know, we probably would
have been there by now...

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,680
...if you guys didn't have to, like,
put on four different bathing suits.

113
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
I asked you
to please not call me.

114
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,200
Evelyn, don't hang up.
It's important.

115
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
We discovered something.
I want you to come up.

116
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,440
I told you I'm not ready
to see you.

117
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,360
Can we please
just leave it at that?

118
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Ev, I just...

119
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
I want you to understand.

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
You want me to understand?

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760
Dad, you couldn't even
make it to her funeral.

122
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,520
Evelyn, this is important.

123
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,720
It's important to our cause.

124
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Look, Dad, it's not my cause.

125
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,960
It's your cause.
You're the one who chose...

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,280
Okay, so apparently people just get out
of vehicles when they're moving.

127
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
Everybody knows about global warming.
Congratulations.

128
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,240
It just really too bad
nobody really gives a shit.

129
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,160
Ev, I'll...

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,200
...give you all
of your mother's money.

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,600
- No more monthly payments?
- That's right.

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,400
There are some students
coming up from Dawson...

133
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,640
I'll save you a seat.

134
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, Evy, get in the car!

135
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,080
Uh, I'll... I don't know.
I'll think about it.

136
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,200
- Get in the car!
- Dad, look, I have to go.

137
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,160
I'll think about it.
Could you hold on a minute?

138
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,400
- We're moving.
- Calm down.

139
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
How can I communicate
with the world...

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
...when I can't even communicate
with my own daughter?

141
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,080
She's just angry right now.
She'll come around.

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
What?

143
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,320
Eight hours from bottle
to throttle, buddy.

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Are you good?

145
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,480
Yeah, I'm good.

146
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Someone named Ling called.

147
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,480
- Said she was running late.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,920
Sounded cute.

149
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,960
Hello?

150
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,920
Bart, I need your help.

151
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,560
Dr. Kruipen?

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,960
I can't reach Evy.
She can't come up.

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,480
Why?
Is everything okay?

154
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes, everything's fine.

155
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,560
Just make sure she
doesn't come up.

156
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,000
- Okay.
- I'll send her paperwork back with you.

157
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Sure.

158
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,920
Listen...

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
Did you reach Bart?

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,160
David, did you
tell them not to come?

161
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,960
To call for help?

162
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,240
- Yes, I did.
- Thank God.

163
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Nuti is...

164
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
...he's much worse.

165
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,720
And I'm...

166
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,720
I'm not much better.

167
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,280
- Hey, nice chopper.
- Thanks.

168
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,240
- Where are you from?
- Dawson City.

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
- Where are you from originally?
- Dawson City.

170
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,600
One of you gentlemen want
to help her with her bags there?

171
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,120
Yeah. Here, let me
take that for you.

172
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,240
No thanks.

173
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,360
- Oh, hey, let me get that.
- Oh, thank you.

174
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
Thanks.

175
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,440
- Can I ride in the front?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,880
There you go.
Hop in.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,160
Thanks.

178
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,920
Oh, shoot.

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,760
Uh, just put your stuff
in the back there, guys.

180
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
- Evy.
- Hey, Bart.

181
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,720
Well... shoot.

182
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
You weren't supposed
to come up.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,400
- What?
- That's what he said.

184
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,640
I was supposed to give you some
sort of paperwork when I got back.

185
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
So he doesn't even
want me to come up there?

186
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

187
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,080
You know what? I don't really
care what he says. I'm coming.

188
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Uh... Uh... Evy?

189
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,200
Listen...

190
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
...that's going to put me
in a really tight spot, see...

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
- 'cause...
- Sorry, Bart.

192
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah, you see, I kinda...
I promised him...

193
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,480
Okay.

194
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,640
Ground Control, this is Major Tom.
We're outta here, man.

195
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,480
This is Ground Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

196
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
Did I hear that you're
David Kruipen's daughter?

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,880
Yeah.

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,000
No way. That...
it must be so cool.

199
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,320
Yeah, he's my hero.

200
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,760
Is it true that
when he was younger...

201
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,040
...he sabotaged a pipeline
that was blocking...

202
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,320
- Migratory caribou?
- I guess so, yeah.

203
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Huh, sure has changed.

204
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,280
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.

205
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
I'll wrap him in plastic...

206
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
...just in case.

207
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,040
Make sure it's sealed.

208
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,000
We need to protect ourselves...

209
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,640
...until we're ready.

210
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
Are you okay?

211
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,480
No.

212
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,880
Ready for what?

213
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,840
Edward, ready for what?

214
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,760
Look at that ice.

215
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
Yeah, she's breaking up
more and more every year.

216
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,200
It's terrible.
When are we gonna wake up?

217
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,640
It's not that easy, buddy, not when
people's lifestyles are at stake.

218
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
What are you
implying, Federico?

219
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,640
I'm just saying that we can't ignore
the reality of what we're up against.

220
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,200
Somebody's got
to take responsibility.

221
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,200
Okay, sure, but what are we
really doing to stop it?

222
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,840
I mean really stop it?

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,760
Look at Kruipen. He's attacking
the problem from the inside out...

224
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,800
- Changing how people think.
- What if we don't have that much time?

225
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,680
Maybe the best way to change
how people think is to...

226
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,000
...blow something up,
you know?

227
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,000
Look at that ice down there.
That's melting fast.

228
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,520
What do you think?

229
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh... You don't want to know
what I think.

230
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Sure we do.

231
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,720
Honestly, I think that people
are incapable of change...

232
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
...and our days are numbered. Might as well
enjoy the place while we can.

233
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,120
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

234
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,600
Nobody's willing to make
any sacrifices.

235
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,000
Thar she blows.

236
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,680
There's no power.

237
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,480
What is that smell?

238
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,840
Smells like something
died in here.

239
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
Mmm, ahem!

240
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,760
Hello!

241
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,880
Dr. Kruipen?
Edward?

242
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,080
Why is there no heat?

243
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah, wouldn't the pipes
freeze at night?

244
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,720
They must be
out in the field.

245
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,200
There's no running water either.

246
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,800
The genny must be off.

247
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm gonna go check it out,
okay? All right.

248
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,040
Hey, where you going?

249
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,920
The restroom.
Is that okay with you?

250
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,160
Well, now we know why
one of us got bumped.

251
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
Yeah, and she doesn't even
sound like she wants to be here.

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
Shoot.

253
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,120
Did you want a water?

254
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
No thanks.

255
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,480
I'm gonna go look around.

256
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
Ling...

257
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,280
...look, I know I can never
expect you to trust me again.

258
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,600
I made a huge mistake.

259
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,440
You are so full of shit.

260
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,280
What, a little makeup sex
in the Arctic?

261
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,080
Something to tell
your buddies about?

262
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,880
- You know it's not like that.
- Oh, really?

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,240
Well, then...
why tell me this now?

264
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,040
I don't know.
You were so angry.

265
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,440
And I was scared.

266
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Evelyn?

267
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

268
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
You don't really believe what
you said in the helicopter, do you?

269
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,160
What did I say?

270
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,240
About just giving up.

271
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
Bet your dad
doesn't think that.

272
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,320
You'd probably know what
he thinks better than I do.

273
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,520
My dad's in the oil business.

274
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,240
A few years ago,
one of his rigs hit sour gas...

275
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,560
...and the well blew out.

276
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,200
The gas blew downwind
and killed nine people.

277
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,400
I asked him how he could live
with himself and you know what he said?

278
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,640
"Plenty more
where they came from. "

279
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,640
Just part of the risk.

280
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,400
So now you know why
I'm willing to blow shit up.

281
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
You don't really think that
ecoterrorism is the answer.

282
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
I don't know.

283
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,720
But I want to do what needs to be done,
be there when the ball starts rolling.

284
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,920
There's a flashlight in the lab. We'll
need it if the genny doesn't start.

285
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,320
Ewww.

286
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,960
- Man.
- Ugh.

287
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Oh, that is brutal.

288
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
God, it stinks.

289
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,760
What the hell is that?

290
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,200
I don't know.

291
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,000
Hold on.
Don't get so close.

292
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,440
Oh my God!
Oh, shit, are you okay?

293
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, it's okay.

294
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,880
Hello?

295
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah, we're in here.

296
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,520
Oh, Jeez Louise!

297
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,520
Not exactly my choice
of words, but...

298
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
...yeah.

299
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,400
Why do they have this
rotting bear in here?

300
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,040
- Oh.
- I don't know, but I need a picture.

301
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
Ow!
Something just bit me.

302
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,960
What?

303
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,520
Ow.

304
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,280
I think it's just a flea bite.
You're gonna make it.

305
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,040
Let's get out of here.
The stink is getting to me.

306
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,360
Evelyn, hold up.

307
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,520
I heard a gunshot.

308
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,240
What?

309
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,120
From out in the field
when I was filling up the genny.

310
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,360
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

311
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,120
I just thought
you should know.

312
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,160
Okay?

313
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay.

314
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,400
My name is David Kruipen.

315
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,240
"What is sacrifice?"

316
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,120
Base station
to field station, come in.

317
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,280
Base station to field station.

318
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,600
Dad?

319
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
Dad, are you out there?

320
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,320
Evelyn?

321
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Jane, could you please
put my dad on?

322
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,160
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

323
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,640
I don't want to discuss this with you.
Could you please put my dad on?

324
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,560
Evelyn, are the students
with you?

325
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,240
Yes, of course they're here.
Why wouldn't they be?

326
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,720
Jane, could you please
put my father on?

327
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,360
David!

328
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,040
They're here!
The students are here.

329
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,560
David, Evelyn's here.

330
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,760
She's on the radio.

331
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,680
She's at the base station.

332
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,960
What's going on, David?

333
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,600
Evelyn, what are you
doing here?

334
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,960
- So now you don't even want to see me?
- I do.

335
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,560
It's just... it's very important
that you stay where you are.

336
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,200
Where are you?
Everybody's waiting.

337
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,080
Please do what I'm saying,
just this once.

338
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,240
- What's going on?
- Just do what I'm asking this one time.

339
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,640
Okay?

340
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,000
Please?

341
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,560
Okay. Fine.

342
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,600
Good.

343
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
Why are they here?

344
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,920
- I don't know.
- What did you do?

345
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
You should lay down.

346
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll be there in a minute.

347
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,080
The students are here.
Evelyn too.

348
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,680
What did you tell Jane?

349
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,360
Nothing.
I don't think she's...

350
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,360
...got the strength
to go through with it.

351
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,960
- I'll take care of it.
- I know.

352
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,720
- We're doing the right thing.
- I know.

353
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Jane?

354
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,480
Edward, no!

355
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
Any luck?

356
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,320
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, they're on their way.

357
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,920
Good.

358
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,840
Everything okay?

359
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,560
I don't know. Why did he
tell you not to bring me?

360
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,440
- He didn't say.
- God, he's such an asshole.

361
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,560
It tears him up, Evy.
It really does.

362
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,200
Look, I know you're probably
still mad about the funeral.

363
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
But he did everything
he could to get there.

364
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,720
- I mean, we were snowed in.
- Yeah, I know.

365
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,120
You hear that?

366
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,560
Yeah, what is that?

367
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,920
It sounds like...

368
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,160
...homo sapiens mating.

369
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,840
I missed you so much.

370
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,840
I know you did.

371
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,560
A bug!

372
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,480
- Jesus.
- What?

373
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
It's a bug.

374
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,520
- It's just a bug.
- You don't understand.

375
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,320
It's something I've had since
I was a kid. It's a phobia, okay?

376
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
It's... it's a...

377
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,080
I can't handle it.

378
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
You never told me that.

379
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,000
It's not exactly
something I'm proud of.

380
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,640
All right?
Now come on, let's go.

381
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,240
Where are you going?
I'm not going to go sleep out there.

382
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,400
Okay, come on, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

383
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,640
- Please come with me.
- It's okay, Feddy.

384
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,320
- I'll look after you.
- I can't stay here.

385
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,200
Okay? I'll be
in the other room.

386
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,320
What are you doing?

387
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,760
Somebody's here.

388
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,040
Bart!

389
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,360
- You guys!
- God.

390
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,680
I feel like ass.

391
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,720
Dude, your arm is bleeding.

392
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,560
Jeez Louise,
this ain't no flea bite.

393
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,320
- Ow!
- Stop scratching it.

394
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,360
It's flipping itchy, man.

395
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
Hello?

396
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,520
Dad?

397
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,080
Hello?

398
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,440
Jane? Oh my God.

399
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,720
Help!
Somebody help!

400
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
What was that?

401
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,520
What's going on?

402
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,080
Ling?

403
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,360
No no, Ling...

404
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
Ling, honey, it's okay.

405
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,080
Ling, you'll be fine, baby.

406
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,200
- Who the hell is this?
- My dad's assistant.

407
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,440
Evelyn found her
in the helicopter.

408
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,080
Jesus Christ.

409
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,560
I... I thought
there was a bug.

410
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
- Uh-huh.
- It was just my zipper.

411
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,600
Yeah.

412
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,680
- I'm gonna try my dad again.
- Okay.

413
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,160
Oh, uh...

414
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,480
...sorry.

415
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Base station
to field station, come in.

416
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,120
Base station to
field station, come in.

417
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,960
Dad, it's me.
Come in.

418
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Dad, are you there?

419
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,080
Ahem.
Is she contagious?

420
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,280
I don't know.

421
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,000
She's burning up.
Might be pneumonia.

422
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,320
We gotta get her out of here.
She needs medical attention.

423
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,360
That's the best idea
I've heard in a long time.

424
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,120
This place is infested with bugs.
Ling's got bites all over her face.

425
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,240
We gotta get out of here.
I got this... it's a medical condition.

426
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,520
It's a phobia.
It's like a panic attack!

427
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,960
All right, all right.

428
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,160
As soon as light breaks,
we'll fly out to Sachs Harbour.

429
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,000
What about my dad?
Nobody's answering at the field station.

430
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,800
Something's obviously
happened out there... something bad.

431
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,200
We don't even know where
"out there" is, do we?

432
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,520
What?

433
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,720
Look, the ATV she came
in on has a GPS unit.

434
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,440
We'll get the coordinates for
the field station. We'll fly out there...

435
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,720
...and we'll see what's going on.

436
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,760
If there's an emergency,
we'll call for a second chopper.

437
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,640
Okay, sounds reasonable.

438
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
Guys, I'm sorry.

439
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,440
It's all right. Let's load everything
into the helicopter.

440
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,160
We'll come back
and we'll get Jane.

441
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,880
- Thank you.
- Okay.

442
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,840
Where did you get
my dad's camera?

443
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,760
It was in Jane's jacket.

444
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,360
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,880
There's no tape.

446
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,480
Okay, guys, come on,
let's get packing. Let's go.

447
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,200
Are you okay?

448
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah.

449
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,400
- What time is it?
- About 3:00 a. M.

450
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,720
Jesus.

451
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,080
Holy shit.

452
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,680
What is it?

453
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,480
Oh, man.

454
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,720
- What?
- Take a look.

455
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,760
Jesus H Christ.

456
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,560
- What the heck was she thinking?
- That's a really good question.

457
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,240
What?

458
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
- Sabotage.
- Jane.

459
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,280
It'll take me a couple
hours to fix this.

460
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,200
You gotta be kidding me?
Can't we call another helicopter?

461
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,200
It won't take me that long.

462
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Oh, whoa whoa.
What's that for?

463
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
Relax, it's just a precaution.

464
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,040
- I have to go.
- Evy!

465
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,080
- Where are you going?
- The field station.

466
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,760
I don't think
that's a good idea.

467
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,360
No kidding. What if this thing's
fixed and you're not back?

468
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,560
- Evy.
- Honestly, what do we do?

469
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,240
Hey, that woman's really sick.
I don't think she can breathe.

470
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,760
Come on.

471
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,280
Oh my God,
oh my God.

472
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Oh, Jane!

473
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,760
Jane, it's me. It's Evelyn.

474
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
Oh no.

475
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,080
We have to do something.
It's okay.

476
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,440
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

477
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,400
Sorry for what?
It's okay.

478
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,000
- Don't let them leave.
- Let who leave?

479
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,920
No.

480
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,560
Holy shit.

481
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,120
- She can't breathe!
- What can I do? Tell me what to do!

482
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,320
No, stay with me, please.
Please!

483
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,280
Jane, stay with me.
It's okay.

484
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,280
No no.

485
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,960
- No!
- No no no no! I wouldn't do that, no.

486
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,880
Better seal off the room.
Who knows what she's got?

487
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,880
Yeah, it's a good call.

488
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,080
There... there's some plastic...

489
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,080
...around back by the genny.

490
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,200
Yeah.

491
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
Come on, everybody out.

492
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,880
Now.

493
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,960
Just give me a minute.
I knew her!

494
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,720
Evy.

495
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,080
Oh, God damn it.

496
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,920
Hey, where the hell is she going?
I thought we agreed to stick together?

497
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,960
Atom!

498
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,320
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

499
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,120
That woman just died in there, man.
Think about it.

500
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,600
That's her dad out there, man.

501
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,200
As soon as that helicopter gets fixed,
we're getting out of here.

502
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,160
Get the duct tape.
Let's seal up this door.

503
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,720
Evelyn!

504
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,800
- Wait for me.
- What are you doing?

505
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,560
I'm coming with you.

506
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,720
Why'd you stop?

507
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,560
Shoot.

508
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,160
Shoot.

509
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,360
- How is it going?
- It's worse than I thought.

510
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Why didn't you say something?
We should be calling for help.

511
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,680
- I'm doing everything I can, okay?
- This is so fucked.

512
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,360
Dad?

513
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,080
Dad?

514
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,280
Holy crap.

515
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,120
Is that a wooly mammoth?

516
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,120
Jesus, it's pristine.

517
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,680
What is it?

518
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,240
It looks like eggs of some kind.

519
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,720
Yeah, it looks like they're
thawing with the mammoth.

520
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,160
Oh my God,
did you see that?

521
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,640
That's impossible.

522
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,520
Isn't there that
species of frog?

523
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,600
Yeah, the-the... Um...

524
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,280
...the wood frog... its liver glycogen
converts to glucose...

525
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,400
...but, you know,
that happens over a winter.

526
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,840
This thing's gotta be what?
20,000 years old?

527
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah.

528
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
Dad?

529
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,240
Oh... oh my God.

530
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,520
- Who is that?
- It's Edward.

531
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,360
He works for my dad.

532
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,360
Dad!

533
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,880
No no no.

534
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,120
- No no no...
- Evelyn.

535
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,160
No, God, no!

536
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,040
- Don't don't, Evelyn!
- No, please.

537
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,360
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to see him like this.

538
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,720
- No no!
- Don't remember him like this.

539
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,480
It's okay.

540
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,440
What am I supposed
to do now?

541
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,920
It's not fair!

542
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,360
He's gone and I still hate him.

543
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,440
Ow, ohh.

544
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, Jesus Christ.

545
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,520
I just had the most
painful piss of my life.

546
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,560
- Any idea why?
- What are you saying?

547
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,440
- Oh, little Miss Innocent?
- Oh God.

548
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,120
Who have you been seeing
for the past couple months?

549
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,960
Jesus, baby, I'm sorry.

550
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,560
I just...

551
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh, I guess I'm just...

552
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,600
I'm scared, okay?

553
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,920
There's something
wrong with us.

554
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,120
Some kind of infection.

555
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,680
It's inside of me
down there.

556
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,400
What happened?

557
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,880
They're all dead.

558
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,480
Shot.

559
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,560
Jane shot them all.

560
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,360
Kruipen too?

561
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,480
Why would she do that?

562
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,640
I don't know.

563
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,960
Look, man, I don't know
what a "20" is...

564
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,200
I just know that we're
in trouble and we need help now.

565
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,000
I just need to know
where you are.

566
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,520
What are your coordinates?

567
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,960
I don't know where I am, man.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

568
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,760
- David Kruipen's research center.
- Okay, stand by.

569
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,000
Ling, are you all right?

570
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,920
Get out. Get out!

571
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,600
- Evy, what are you doing?
- I need to see her.

572
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,280
- This room is quarantined, Evelyn.
- Please!

573
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,520
Please, you have to trust me.
We need to see her, please.

574
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,920
Please trust me.

575
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,120
Please.

576
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,600
Oh God.

577
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,720
What is it?

578
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,000
- Eggs.
- What do you mean eggs?

579
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,360
Like the ones
from the mammoth?

580
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,080
What?

581
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,440
- Oh my God, did you see that?
- What?

582
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,000
- What happened?
- The bugs that bit Ling...

583
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,200
...they must be some kind of parasite.
I just saw one. They're inside of Jane.

584
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,560
- We gotta move her.
- We have to get her to the lab.

585
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,280
It's a separate structure.

586
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,160
Come on, use the sheet
to wrap her up.

587
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,760
What is it, Evy?

588
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,520
The bear's infected too.

589
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,760
There's more eggs over here.

590
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,840
I wonder how long they stay
in their larval state.

591
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,880
I radioed for a rescue helicopter.
We're getting out of here.

592
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,960
- How long?
- A few hours if the weather holds.

593
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,440
Oh, thank God.

594
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,920
What, Evy?

595
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,120
We have to call them back
and tell them not to come.

596
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,240
- Excuse me?
- They won't be prepared.

597
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,040
We have to contact disease control.
They'll have time to study this thing...

598
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,000
- And decide what to do.
- What?

599
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,520
- Evelyn, we have to get out of here.
- We have to be quarantined.

600
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,320
Quarantined?
Are you out of your mind?

601
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,040
Ling is sick in there. She's been
throwing up. We have to get out of here.

602
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,720
- Federico, you don't understand.
- Hold on, hold on.

603
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,320
Maybe we're jumping
to conclusions.

604
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,000
I mean, we're just
students here.

605
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,000
She's not even a student.

606
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,920
They died out there
because they couldn't stop it!

607
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,640
They're dead?

608
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,920
Jane was trying to stop us
from getting home.

609
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,960
She said don't let them leave...
she was talking about the bugs.

610
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,520
What do you mean?
What bugs?

611
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,160
Look, you don't know that.

612
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,200
We don't know what
happened out there.

613
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,480
- You saw the eggs in the mammoth, Atom.
- Mammoth?

614
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,200
Jesus Christ, would somebody please
tell me what's going on here?

615
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,560
There's a wooly mammoth
in a glacier melting out there.

616
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,800
It's full of eggs.
The same ones that are in this bear...

617
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,520
...the same ones that are in Jane, and very
likely, the same ones that are in Ling.

618
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,360
And me.

619
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,040
And Ling?

620
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
Fed...

621
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,480
...we think that the insects
that bit Ling...

622
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,760
- They're laying eggs inside.
- What?

623
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,960
They're some sort
of prehistoric parasite...

624
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
...that thawed in the ice
inside the mammoth.

625
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,800
This is so sick.

626
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,960
You guys are sick. Where would you
come up with something like this?

627
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,000
We have to contact disease control.
They'll know what to do better than us.

628
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,240
No no.

629
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,560
No no... Hey!
Where are you going?

630
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,880
Hey hey!

631
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,800
We could die here.

632
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,440
Hey, stay away
from the radio!

633
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,120
Don't. Don't!

634
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,920
- Put the gun down!
- I didn't have a choice.

635
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,120
I'm in charge now. Until the helicopter
arrives, I'm in charge!

636
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,800
What was that noise?

637
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,760
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a scratch.

638
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,440
Oh, Jesus.

639
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,360
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

640
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,960
Soon, baby, soon.

641
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,200
Jesus.

642
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,560
It's the same color as...

643
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,400
- As what?
- Maybe you'd be comfortable lying down.

644
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,040
- That's a good idea.
- Same color as what?

645
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,760
All right, put her
in the spare bedroom.

646
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,000
It's okay, baby.

647
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,120
You'll be fine.
You just need to lie down for a minute.

648
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,920
- Where's Feddy?
- I'm right here, babe.

649
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,280
- When are we going home?
- Soon.

650
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,400
Really soon.
It won't be long now.

651
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,600
Wait.

652
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,240
We need to seal off the room.

653
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,200
- What about me?
- Good question.

654
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,840
You guys need to see this.

655
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,440
What is that?

656
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,720
What do you think it is?

657
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,560
Oh my God.

658
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,080
Ohh.

659
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,040
Do you think they can get out?

660
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,680
No. But we need
to seal that door.

661
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,800
Okay.

662
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,320
I need to do
something about this.

663
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,920
Right now.

664
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,680
Bart, wait.
What are you going to do?

665
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,320
I doubt there's a chopper between
here and Dawson City this time of year.

666
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,280
They're not gonna
be here for a while...

667
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,880
...and I ain't got that kind of time.

668
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,160
If these things hatch,
they'll spread.

669
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,440
If that happens, I'm done.

670
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,720
If I can just kind
of get underneath...

671
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,680
...some of them.

672
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,960
If I can just...

673
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,960
It's starting to come off a little bit.

674
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
- Oh shit.
- Oh, Jesus!

675
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,520
No.

676
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,000
No no no,
don't look at me.

677
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,080
Bart, no, you'll lose
too much blood.

678
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Okay, then...

679
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,600
...we'll burn them out then.
I don't see why not.

680
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,440
We'll just douse
the arm in gasoline.

681
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,880
How do you know if you'll get them all?
You'll have to burn it to the bone.

682
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,040
If you don't do it...

683
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,440
I will.

684
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,960
We have to be
more prepared.

685
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,880
Are you sure about this?
I don't even know if this is morphine.

686
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,840
The worst that can
happen is that I OD.

687
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,840
There are worse ways to go.

688
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,840
Go on, man, jab it in.

689
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,960
Jeez Louise.

690
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,120
There we go.

691
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,520
Oooh, a guy could
get used to that.

692
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,640
All right, man, do it.

693
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,200
Something's happening
in there.

694
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,920
They're hatching.

695
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,960
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

696
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,480
Atom, hurry!

697
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,600
This isn't right.
You can't just chop off body parts.

698
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,360
This isn't the way.

699
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,640
- Atom.
- Do it.

700
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,120
Atom!

701
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,240
- Atom, do it again!
- Oooh.

702
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,160
Atom!

703
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,440
- Evelyn.
- Oh my God.

704
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,880
Bart.

705
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,160
Get the bugs.

706
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,360
- With what?
- Try the bug spray.

707
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,960
- It's not working.
- There's a lighter... try it.

708
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,000
God, I can't stop it.

709
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,960
It's working.
It's working.

710
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,880
I need something else to stop
the bleeding. This is not working.

711
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,680
I saw in the...
ATV kit.

712
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,440
Is he okay?

713
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:56,720
- The bleeding's starting to slow.
- Aw, he could go into shock.

714
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,840
Get his arm up.
Get his arm up.

715
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,280
We gotta put him on the couch.
Lie him on his back.

716
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,800
Okay?
Okay?

717
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,360
Come on, come on.
There we go.

718
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,680
- Get some gauze and some tape.
- Okay.

719
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,600
Lie him on his back. Okay, wait...
put his feet up, okay?

720
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,040
- Put his feet up.
- Oh, fuck.

721
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,880
There we go.
There we go, buddy.

722
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,520
Got the tape.
We need some gauze.

723
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
Shit.

724
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,840
What the hell?

725
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,720
Shit.

726
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,600
It looks like they knew
what they were dealing with.

727
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,200
Who?

728
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,080
Dr. Kruipen.

729
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,520
It's a vertebrate.
It's not a bug.

730
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,840
- So we're related to this thing?
- Yeah.

731
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,120
It says that the males are harmless,
except for they create the sores...

732
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,040
...that the females bore into
and then they lay their eggs...

733
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,000
...and multiply.

734
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,960
What are you saying?
If you're bit by a male...

735
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,800
...you might not necessarily
be infected?

736
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,200
Yeah, the eggs
are the only threat.

737
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,960
These tapes, they only
date up to yesterday.

738
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,960
We have to see what's on them.
We need to know...

739
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,800
...exactly what we're
dealing with right now.

740
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,440
This tape's the most recent.
Where's my dad's camera?

741
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,960
It's with Jane's jacket.
But we put all that stuff in the lab.

742
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,840
- What the hell are you doing?
- We have to get in there.

743
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,440
You're not going back in there.
It's completely sealed.

744
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,280
You're just going to bring
those bugs back in here with you.

745
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,840
We need to get the information
before the helicopter gets here.

746
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,240
There might be something
in there that can help Ling.

747
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,600
Maybe save us all.

748
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,280
You get any bugs on you,
you're not coming back in here.

749
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,200
Evelyn!
Behind you!

750
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,680
Shit.

751
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,760
There's no fucking way she's getting
in here. She's covered in bugs.

752
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,360
- Back off!
- Let me out! Let me out!

753
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,440
No no!

754
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,200
There's... There's...
there's bugs on her!

755
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,520
Atom, step away from her.

756
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,320
Atom, step away.

757
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,960
There's one under my shirt!

758
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,320
God!

759
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,680
What the fuck is that?

760
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,480
Get it out.

761
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,880
Get it!

762
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,360
- It's fine.
- What if it laid eggs in her? Huh?

763
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,360
I got it. She's fine.

764
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,600
All right. Um...

765
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,200
...the rest now.

766
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,160
She's clean, Fed.
Drop it.

767
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,760
Take the rest
of your clothes off.

768
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,960
- Now.
- It's okay.

769
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,200
He's right.

770
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,560
Atom, I need you
to check me.

771
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,440
She's clean.

772
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,520
Okay.

773
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,920
I had to be sure.

774
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,920
Are you sure you
want to see this?

775
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,480
Of course.

776
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,440
I'm really sorry,
you know?

777
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,280
Whatever happened between you
and your dad, I know it must be hard.

778
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,240
The weather's cleaning up.
They should be here soon.

779
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,560
What exactly are you guys
trying to find on that tape?

780
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,200
I mean, they're bugs and they
eat people... it's that simple.

781
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,920
We need to know what's gonna
happen if the bugs get off the island.

782
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,480
What kind of habitat
can they survive in?

783
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,360
What are the odds
of this turning into a pandemic?

784
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,960
My dad would have
thought this through.

785
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,560
We have to get that
information back.

786
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,440
"Today I rediscovered...

787
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,640
...what I knew when
I was young.

788
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,120
Whoa!
One got out.

789
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,800
Somebody kill it.

790
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,720
Oh my God.

791
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,280
It's time to get out of here.

792
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,840
We have to get
to the helicopter.

793
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,320
It's the only safe place.
Everything else should be burned.

794
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,280
- Help me! Help me!
- Oh my God.

795
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,120
Shit, they're coming
through the vents.

796
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,640
- We've got to get her out of there.
- No, we can't.

797
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,200
- There's too many. It's too dangerous.
- We gotta do something.

798
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,240
- What's going on?
- The vertebrates... they're with Ling.

799
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,240
We gotta sedate her.
Get me some drugs, man.

800
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,680
Get me something to wear...
something protective.

801
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,600
Jeez, you almost fell.

802
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,240
You gotta loosen this.
It's too tight.

803
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,160
I can't.

804
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,480
Feddy!

805
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,160
Feddy, open this door, Feddy.

806
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,240
- Almost got it.
- Agh.

807
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,080
Help me, Feddy.

808
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,920
Oh, please,
you have them too.

809
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,720
Feddy, what are you doing?

810
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,600
She was suffering.
She asked me to.

811
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,080
She's still alive.

812
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,600
You son of a bitch.

813
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,560
I gotta sedate her.

814
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,240
Bart, wait.

815
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,800
It's okay, Evy.

816
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,920
- I got nothing to lose.
- No.

817
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,440
Evelyn, come on.
Come on, we've gotta go.

818
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,960
We need to make sure
everyone's clean before we leave.

819
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,480
I'm going straight
to the helicopter.

820
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,720
Anybody who wants to leave
can come with me.

821
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,080
It's just a precaution.
We're not accusing you of anything.

822
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,320
We just want to be sure.

823
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,560
Fuck that.

824
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,800
Federico, wait!

825
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,040
You can't go in there.
I know why you shot Ling.

826
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
You're gonna fuck
this up, aren't you?

827
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,200
- Fed...
- Shut the fuck up, Atom.

828
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,280
Soon as the helicopter gets here,
she's gonna blow the whistle on me.

829
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:15,000
And that means I'm gonna
die with these fucking bugs in my dick.

830
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,320
I can't let that happen.

831
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,840
Please don't.

832
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,640
I'm sorry.

833
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,200
Dad?

834
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,160
- Dad!
- Kruipen.

835
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,280
Oh my God,
you're alive!

836
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,920
I'm sorry.

837
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,240
Me too.

838
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:44,280
I'm so sorry.

839
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,840
- Are you infected?
- No.

840
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,880
- You're shot.
- I'm okay.

841
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,040
Jane...

842
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,080
Jane died.

843
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,080
She sabotaged
the helicopter.

844
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,760
It's okay though.
We already called for help.

845
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,400
The whole place...
it's almost entirely infested.

846
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,960
Now the only safe place
is the helicopter.

847
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,000
We're gonna burn it down.

848
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,600
There's some gasoline
around the back.

849
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,440
- You should wait in the helicopter.
- I'll be okay. Go on.

850
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,040
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

851
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,800
Bet you wish you didn't
get on that helicopter now, huh?

852
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,240
What?

853
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,880
He knew.

854
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,520
"These parasites were
discovered in a thawing glacier.

855
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,840
They are just one...

856
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,240
...of the horrors that will
come from global warming.

857
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,200
And so today I...

858
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,920
...prepare this statement...

859
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,600
...as I prepare myself...

860
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,520
...for the ultimate sacrifice,
the only sacrifice.

861
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,640
Though thousands will die...

862
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,800
...the threat will surely
be contained.

863
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,800
This video, too,
will surely be contained.

864
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,600
But the impact of both...

865
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,840
...will survive...

866
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,920
...spread through the veins
of the internet...

867
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,840
...onto the screens
of the youth...

868
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,240
...into your souls...

869
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,280
...into your spirit.

870
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,520
You will know the need
to sacrifice.

871
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,720
You will know
the time is now.

872
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,200
You were right, Evy.
No one cares.

873
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,680
May I have the tape, please?

874
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,640
Dad, please. Please don't do this.
There has to be another way.

875
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,480
Please.
People listen to you.

876
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,520
- You didn't.
- I only said that to hurt you.

877
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,920
You were right.
You've always been right.

878
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,680
We can change people's minds, but, Dad,
this is not the way to do it, please.

879
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,480
I'm getting on the helicopter.

880
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,440
Alone.

881
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,960
When the fear...
when it spreads...

882
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,480
...the people will know.

883
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,640
- You can't go.
- Maybe he's right.

884
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,440
How could he
possibly be right?

885
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,440
Dad, you were going to save me.
What about everybody else?

886
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,040
What about
other people's children?

887
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,760
How do you know how quickly
they'll be able to isolate it?

888
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,560
How many people
are going to die? Thousands.

889
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,440
Maybe hundreds of thousands.
Plenty more where they came from, right?

890
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,920
Please. Please don't.

891
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,600
I'm sorry.

892
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,640
Dad!

893
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,520
No!

894
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,160
- No.
- The window... gotta go to the window.

895
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,160
Oh my God.

896
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,160
That's Dr. Kruipen.
He looks hurt.

897
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,440
Are you okay?

898
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,680
- I should take a look at that.
- No, let's go.

899
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,400
Hey, is there
somebody else in there?

900
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,960
Quarantine.
They're contaminated.

901
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:24,360
- Are you contaminated?
- No. Let's go.

902
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,520
Aw, shit!

903
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,520
Stop, he's infected!

904
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,400
Stop, this whole area's
quarantined!

905
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,440
- He's on the skid.
- If he gets in, we die.

906
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,200
- He's infected.
- What did he say?

907
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,720
This whole area's quarantined.

908
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,720
Something about the quarantine.
We've got to put him down.

909
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,440
We can't.

910
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,520
He's infected.

911
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,600
He's rocking us.
I can't stabilize it.

912
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,320
- Jesus Christ. Is he okay?
- He's not moving.

913
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,200
- We need to go now.
- What about her?

914
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,400
- She'll be okay.
- No.

915
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,760
No.

916
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,240
Hey, she's got a gun!

917
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,680
Get up, get up!

918
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,480
Aw, fuck!

919
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,760
Fuck!

920
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,280
Come on!

921
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,360
Oh my God, no, we need
to get you to the helicopter.

922
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,080
No, it's too late.

923
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,680
- No.
- It's too late.

924
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,360
You have to... you have to get your
father's notes. You have to warn them.

925
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,360
I can't.

926
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,920
No, I can't leave you here.
I can't do this.

927
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,320
Yes, you can, Evy.

928
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,920
This is it.

929
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,800
The ball's rolling.

930
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,920
This is the beginning.

931
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,600
No. No.

932
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,840
What is sacrifice?

933
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,920
We keep saying
we want change...

934
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,080
...but we just keep doing the same
shitty things every day.

935
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,520
And that's no justification
for what my father did.

936
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,400
Or what he tried to do.

937
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,080
A body! There's a body
over here!

938
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,040
But I want people to know that he
really did believe he was helping us...

939
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,760
...and he sacrificed everything...
including himself.

940
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,240
I have a pulse!

941
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,720
Come on, let's get
her out of there!

942
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,400
I used to believe that
people couldn't change...

943
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,760
...that all we could do was just...

944
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,400
...have as much fun as we could
before it all came to an end.

945
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,560
But now...

946
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,720
...now I don't want it to end.

947
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,920
All right, we're back and today...

948
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,000
...we're talking
about Evelyn Kruipen...

949
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:49,040
...daughter of infamous ecologist,
Dr. David Kruipen.

950
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,960
- Max!
- Now she's being hailed as a hero.

951
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,680
- Max, come on.
- She's on the front of every newspaper...

952
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,200
- And website around the globe.
- Come on, boy, let's go.

953
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,800
The Center for Disease Control
said this young woman...

954
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,840
...saved us from total annihilation.

955
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,680
Well, I don't know, Mike.

956
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,160
You're a bit of a conspiracy nut.
What do you think?

957
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,960
Well, callers, what do you think?

958
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,520
What is going to end
the human race?

959
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,760
A giant meteor out of the sky?

960
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,720
Are we all going
to starve to death?

961
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,160
Or is a tiny little bug going
to come and wipe us all out?

962
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,160
First caller, you're on the air.

963
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,080
I honestly think it's just more
global warming propaganda.

964
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,160
I... I think the whole thing's
just a marketing scam.

965
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,920
It's just another example...

966
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,320
...of how vulnerable
we are, you know?

967
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,160
You've got SARS, bird flu, AIDS.

968
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,800
It's just a matter of time
before the big one hits.
