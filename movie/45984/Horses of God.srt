1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,398
You sleep?

2
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,478
No, why?

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,037
In your opinion ...
- What?

4
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,596
She thinks what, Ghislaine, when
she'll know I died a martyr?

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,599
That is to say?

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,635
It will be sad? Happy?
How does it take?

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,390
ll are plenty in paradise.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,754
Ghislaine of hundreds,
thousands ...

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,233
Mark them!

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,838
Cover the ground, guys!

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,480
Fouad! Fuck
not let them shoot!

12
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,879
Watch out!

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,590
Guys, he's all alone!

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,835
Goal!
- It is not intended!

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,794
If you're not a fag,
tell him she's home!

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,999
It's purpose, I say!

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,593
Who's the fag now?

18
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,037
Editing my brother
and I send you to the hospital, got it?

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,151
Out!

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,788
Run, you!

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,472
The next approaching,
I cut his tendons!

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,119
Move it!

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,558
They'll give us the skin!

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,199
Faster, guys!

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,473
Come on, bitch!

26
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,913
Go for it!

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,831
Fuck you!

28
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,278
Rub your hands thoroughly
asshole.

29
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,074
What you looking at?

30
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,438
It's not too early!

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,629
Okay, father?

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,712
Hi, Said.
- What's that smell?

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,393
You went in the garbage?

34
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,154
You have brought still play
in the dirt? Brats!

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,715
Najat, shut up!

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,714
Mell-your own business!
- You breakages us your ears!

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,436
And you'll stop your silliness?

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,113
This is not ...
- Stop lying!

39
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,191
Come on, sit down.

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,800
I always get yelled at
because of you.

41
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,671
Mom, there is what for dinner?

42
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,633
There's six maids.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,310
I'm too old. The boss wants me
more than twice a week.

44
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,471
One only has to find you
another plant.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,391
l can not, with all these young
looking.

46
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,518
It does what Karim, the Sahara?

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,072
They say nothing on the news.

48
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,792
It is happening there.
Your brother will be back soon.

49
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,834
I want it back now.
Why not return it?

50
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,119
Eat and shut up.
- At your service, sir.

51
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,229
Yes, sir!

52
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,679
Right away, sir!

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,515
Yashin!

54
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,832
You'll find anything on this side.

55
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,669
If you want to help me,
looks in this bunch.

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,995
Nabil Homo!
The son Tamou, the bitch!

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,554
You're the fagot!

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,188
Beat it, motherfuckers!

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,675
Fuck, shit!
You hide behind your guy.

60
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,159
I just fuck you!

61
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,191
Clear, dirty bastards!

62
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,237
If I see you here,
I'll blow your head!

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,909
Viewing Hamid
I found a piece of engine.

64
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,193
This is good, stop.

65
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,555
The trucks were stripped
before arriving.

66
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,235
Come here, you.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,675
Stop following him around
like a monkey.

68
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,511
Améne this piece to Ba 'Moussa
he'll give you 10 dirhams. Got it?

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,479
Do not get conned.

70
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,551
Not trust his beard,
is an asshole.

71
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,513
Do not worry.
- Watch out. Go.

72
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,273
Well the empaffé,
are you kidding me?

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,712
You'll spend your life
Own motor?

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,239
What do you want?

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,156
My brother Hamid wants 10 dh.

76
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,788
Tell me first ...
Who the fuck else?

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,994
What is this shit?

78
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,720
My brother Hamid said:
'' 10 dh, if you give it back.''

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,233
Fuck it,
your brother Hamid.

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,999
Released or I'll put a beating
p'tit con.

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,393
And you, says hello
to your mother.

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,439
Tell him I keep him
a beautiful piece.

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,190
What?

84
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,754
My brother Hamid
dh wants 10 or nothing.

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,836
Your brother Hamid?

86
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,268
Get out!

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,472
I'll tell my brother.
- Fuck you and your brother!

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,750
He takes it for? Tarzan?

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,269
Brats!

90
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,436
And you magnez your ass!

91
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,237
Stop messing around,
Be a man.

92
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,517
Do not worry, Real.
You will not be disappointed.

93
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,074
Emerges.

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,995
Madani!

95
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,716
Coffee.

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,194
Ba 'Moussa gave me 2 dh
instead of 10.

97
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,438
And besides he kept the piece.

98
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,909
Asks Nabil.
- I do not have time.

99
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,156
I did what you said,
asks Nabil.

100
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,512
It's okay, I get it.
- I did everything you told me.

101
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,480
I get it, I say.
I'm busy.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,309
Go home.
I have an errand to run for Real.

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,469
Can I come with you?

104
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,790
Hamid!

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,757
It is I, the great Lev Yashin!

106
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,399
And this one?

107
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,996
His name is Lev Yashin.
This is a Russian.

108
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,793
You know what is a Russian?

109
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,434
I always carry with me.

110
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,914
You've never shown me.

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,036
This is the best goalkeeper
of all time.

112
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,598
You will become like him.
- You have not seen Fouad?

113
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,759
Ghislaine, are you okay?

114
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,833
I am looking for my brother.

115
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,273
Do not worry.

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,190
My girlfriend will be home soon
United States.

117
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,760
It will give you
the worst beating of your life.

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,276
You beg to opt-on.

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,319
I'll go see.

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,829
Advance.

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,793
It is not there, go ahead.

122
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,913
Stand erect.

123
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,829
Thank you, Yashin.

124
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,599
They lost against Saudi Arabia.

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,434
Morocco has been more humiliated like this
since its debacle in '79 against Algeria.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,431
Listening.

127
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,834
Said, shut up.

128
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,835
Thank you, my God.
Where you been?

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,438
You want to make me mad?
You want to kill me?

130
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,557
Why are you yelling?
I was with my friends.

131
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,559
Your friends, it's bums
and criminals!

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,912
You spend your days with them!
You saw what time it is?

133
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,472
Your little brother
has just returned.

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,829
Where were you?

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,392
You know Younis, the son of Khadija,
was attacked yesterday?

136
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,676
I know.
- Why are you home so late?

137
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,268
Nobody can touch me here.

138
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,233
And who are you, you?

139
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,399
Too class pumps!
- They like you, Mom?

140
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,108
And that pleases you?

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,833
Perfume. I'm happy
to have you, my son.

142
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,072
I have a man by my side.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,109
Will eat.

144
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,994
Take it to buy us
meat tomorrow.

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,119
I have not forgotten you, Mom.

146
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,829
God bless you.

147
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,833
You still think of Ba 'Moussa?

148
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,072
I'm stupid for letting
make fun of me.

149
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,999
Ba 'Moussa is too big for you.

150
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,830
I can try?

151
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,797
They too are
too big for you.

152
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,797
Father, you feel no
smell good here?

153
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,198
Hamid does not exaggerates.

154
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,440
All those in the first row
come from the medina.

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,999
The neighborhood where I grew up.

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,989
And swarthy?

157
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,231
This is the bodyguard
Sheikh of the UAE.

158
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,674
What is he doing here?
- He is the cousin of the groom.

159
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,640
If it is,
he has a gun under his jacket.

160
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,559
He spent five years
Germany.

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,439
It is there
he learned the trade.

162
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,551
It is broke party
and look at him.

163
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,629
Your father calls you.

164
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,352
So Nabil not you dance?

165
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,234
Where is your mother?
It should already be there.

166
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,039
Everyone expected.

167
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,157
I do not know.
- Go get it.

168
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,714
And you stopped to follow
like a monkey.

169
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,871
This is good. Let him go
with his friend.

170
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,554
Go.

171
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,151
And bring us our Tamou.

172
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,233
Motherfucker cop.

173
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,679
Do you think he emméne
marriage?

174
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,828
Where you want it to emméne?

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,273
One day, I will have her skin.

176
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,473
Watch the bodyguard
how he moves his ass.

177
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,711
Sheikh for whom he works
must like it.

178
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,592
What he Commissioner?
- Pitbull, who cares.

179
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,953
Guys, I found it.

180
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,549
We'll drink with me?
My mother is busy.

181
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,199
You hear? We're going to fete
Tamou on the bed.

182
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,357
Go ahead, I'm right here.

183
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,434
We go.
What acorn that.

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,599
Do not move, you!

185
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,870
This is good, léve up.

186
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,430
Congratulations to the newlyweds!

187
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,876
Goodbye and see you soon!

188
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,038
Our King Hassan II died today
I'hôpitaI to Ibn Sina Rabat.

189
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,271
God rest his soul!

190
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,028
I return.

191
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,599
Are open to anyone!

192
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,877
And now, Ie speech
Our new King Mohamed VI.

193
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,356
Hamid!

194
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,996
Hamid!
Come here.

195
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,515
Where is your brother?
- What happens?

196
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,835
You ask me what's happening?

197
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,153
Where is your brother?
- He's a game.

198
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,470
Go get it
and go home!

199
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,153
Cover the area well!

200
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,510
Mark it!

201
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,158
Fouad, not let him shoot!

202
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,276
Yashin!

203
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,311
Nabil!

204
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,470
Nabil, watch out!

205
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,789
Hey, easy!

206
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,870
You calm down!

207
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,473
What's your problem,
son of a bitch?

208
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,109
Beat it!

209
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,350
Clear!

210
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,189
Move it!

211
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,235
It failed me fart eye
this dog!

212
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,636
Wait for me!
- Khalil, you're shit.

213
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,109
You guys know that the king is m ...
- We know!

214
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,629
Move it!

215
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,359
Yashin, your coffee.

216
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,034
Thank you, Madani.

217
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,318
A new postcard?
- To Italy this morning.

218
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,511
You know who sent it?
- Who?

219
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,314
Adnan and Omar, in Milan.
You remember them?

220
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,591
They came up Italy?
- Yes.

221
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,748
Why are you telling me this?

222
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,198
Did you hear?
Adnan and Omar are in Italy.

223
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,993
Where they found the wheat?

224
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,953
They had to bump someone.

225
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,229
If I had signed with a club,
I have a great life.

226
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,116
You remember Azzedine? If he had
arrested for drink, it would be the star of Raja.

227
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,710
For you, it's not too late.
- You're crazy.

228
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,513
Not too late, my ass.

229
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,436
You got something to smoke?
- What slab.

230
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,994
You never have anything.

231
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,073
Come on breaks.

232
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,430
Come on!

233
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,678
The son of a bitch, in Italy!

234
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,956
And the coffee?
- Tomorrow.

235
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,917
That is,
take me for a fool!

236
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,594
Fouad!

237
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,872
It is not there.
- Are you okay, Ghislaine?

238
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,678
It's okay.
- He's where?

239
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,037
I do not know.
- We'll see you more.

240
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,112
I go to the center
to learn dressmaking.

241
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,313
That is good. And your grandmother?
- It's okay.

242
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,152
Ghislaine, come help me!

243
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,238
I gotta go.

244
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,354
Fouad is not there.

245
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,109
Come on breaks.

246
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,793
You're not stupid, you know
Fouad was not there.

247
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,195
Anything.

248
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,199
Do not take me for a fool.

249
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,069
Mi Lalla surely a plan for it.
And not with a clueless like me.

250
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,832
Its pumps shone
as a mirror.

251
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,275
And he gave me
a ticket 20 dh brand new.

252
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,795
If they were all like him,
I'd gone

253
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,030
typing me
nazes your mouths.

254
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,275
It is your father the lame.
- Seriously, guys ...

255
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,798
I have two friends who rent
in the medina.

256
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,553
They live like kings.

257
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,358
Loose us with your Medina.

258
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,595
You're stupid.

259
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,228
This is real life there.

260
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,960
You find everything you want
in the medina.

261
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,550
Even their shit, it's top.

262
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,238
Wanna taf?
The harbor is within walking distance.

263
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,759
Not like those bastards who build
a factory next door

264
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,992
and bring workers elsewhere.
As if we had leprosy!

265
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,189
I not bump at the factory.

266
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,391
If you want to save money,
bump with your brother.

267
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,309
He wants it.
- He is bosser Amine and not you?

268
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,634
He says I have to sell oranges.
- Oranges!

269
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,268
Oranges?

270
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,348
He does not care about your face.

271
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,955
It's good.

272
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,114
You just added me?

273
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,629
The cops!

274
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,949
Get him one that bar!

275
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,197
Adds.
- It is as usual.

276
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,192
Rates have increased.
- That's all I have.

277
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,476
Advance!

278
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,351
Get off me!

279
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,149
Hurry up.

280
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,755
Come out!

281
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,032
Hurry up, we're in a rush.

282
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,678
I have a sore head,
I slept badly.

283
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,550
Why?

284
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,068
I'm tired of this job.

285
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,272
Want to sell more oranges?
Want to become a lawyer?

286
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,195
I want to work with you.
Amine and why not me?

287
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,794
It was something more than me?

288
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,035
Answer me.

289
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,354
I already answered you.
It is not for you.

290
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,913
If this show one day
should not we both plunged.

291
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,839
Who will take care of the house?

292
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,988
And our mother?

293
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,154
You've figured it out?

294
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,114
Go bosser now.

295
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,517
You still do not want
you store, Tamou?

296
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,555
When I'm hungry, you think of me?
- One day we will stone you.

297
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,199
It is you who made me eat?

298
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,468
We will stone you to death.
- Get off me!

299
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,558
We want more of you here.
- It is you who will feed my son?

300
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,792
Mind your business!
This is my livelihood!

301
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,239
I also fear God.

302
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,075
That's right, bitch, fuck off!

303
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,034
Not bad, Yashin!

304
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,632
Khalil, a head!

305
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,791
Speedez why you like that?
- Pitbull repackages its business!

306
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,593
Now?
- Yeah, now!

307
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,788
Hurry up, Nabil!

308
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,880
Pitbull, mutated!
It is good for us, that.

309
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,231
The bastard, I will miss him!

310
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,632
Transferred? Look at how
I'm going to mutate me.

311
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,155
Son of a bitch!

312
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,709
Lance, if you got the balls!
You're a chick?

313
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,835
It has not got the balls!
- If I do, you take off your pants?

314
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,992
Go to see.
- You take off your pants?

315
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,954
Do it or shut up!
- Look good band nazes.

316
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,193
So, I have balls?
- They will roast you if you stay here!

317
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,832
Come back, we know them!

318
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,356
Climb!

319
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,511
Pitbull! Pitbull!

320
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,312
It's on me, guys!

321
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,478
Round!

322
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,199
Himself or another, is the same.

323
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,035
The problem is when there is
more police here.

324
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,552
And they will leave us
with these thugs.

325
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,875
Pitbull!

326
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,515
Adios!

327
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,079
He'll kill you
if you mug.

328
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,510
Repeats?
- You sent him in the mouth.

329
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,638
In the mouth, so what?

330
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,555
And you ...

331
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,069
You have done in your pants,
little pissy.

332
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,195
What?

333
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,870
Peed in my pants?

334
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,637
I'll blow you, motherfucker!

335
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,679
Hamid, calm down!

336
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,950
This is good, Madani.

337
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,509
We have fun.

338
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,989
You call that fun?

339
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,032
Take a sip.

340
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,468
In health Pitbull!

341
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,916
Hamid, get some fresh air.

342
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,839
Madani, let me go!

343
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,197
You should say thank you!

344
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,352
For having broken the mouth!

345
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,912
Sit.
- Get off me!

346
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,995
Police! Open!

347
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,992
What's going on?

348
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,319
What has he done?

349
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,549
It did nothing!

350
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,994
Get off me!

351
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,591
Let go of my son, he did nothing!
My son!

352
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,832
Mom!
- Get off me, you!

353
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,278
He has done nothing, my son!

354
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,549
My son!

355
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,355
Hamid!

356
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,957
This is not the price
you did to my brother.

357
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,559
I can not make you less.

358
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,399
Why you could with him?
At this price, I'm not doing.

359
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,875
I can not.

360
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,911
You do not want is not the same.

361
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,239
It's like that.
Take it or leave it.

362
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,075
Make up your mind,
My clients expect.

363
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,351
Want. You want to ruin me.

364
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,315
This is my place.

365
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,836
Aziz told me to put me there.

366
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,433
This is my place forever.

367
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,349
I'm not the head,
see-it with Aziz.

368
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,637
Business is good?
- We're not complaining.

369
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,030
Kid!

370
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,714
Who do you work now?

371
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,549
For my brother.

372
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,274
Which one? The crazy
the soldier or the Sahara?

373
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,238
Ah yes, the one who is in jail.

374
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,039
This is my place.
- If you want it, you work for me.

375
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,871
Otherwise I guarantee you nothing.

376
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,280
I work for anyone.
- In person?

377
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,315
You think you're hard?
We will see this.

378
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,228
What's going on?

379
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,915
Answer me.
- Nothing.

380
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,154
Tell me what you have.
- I think your brother.

381
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,155
This house is not the same
since his departure.

382
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,676
I'm afraid for him,
I have no news.

383
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,311
And I have not even
will visit him.

384
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,436
Do not worry about it,
it will come out.

385
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,077
How can you be sure?

386
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,552
He at least
he brought money.

387
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,910
Too soon,
I can help you.

388
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,159
Are you laughing at, asshole?

389
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,515
Father, okay?

390
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,634
Can not you see that choking?
Améne him a glass of water.

391
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,635
A glass of water!
- I can not stand!

392
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,959
Aziz lurking here. If you mug
in this state, it'll break your face.

393
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,716
Fuck it,
he and his oranges!

394
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,956
Come work with me on the site.

395
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,792
Pay me this orange!

396
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,111
I pay with shoe polish.

397
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,911
If you want, I'll wax ass
with cream.

398
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,479
Try to see!

399
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,153
You move?
- I move anywhere.

400
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,155
That's it?

401
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,478
You want to ride me, asshole?

402
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,792
That's all I won,
I swear.

403
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,311
Sort of miscreant,
you swear more?

404
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,629
You're a bum.

405
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,118
You do away customers.

406
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,835
Still drugged.

407
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,595
I'm not an addict.

408
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,710
It is I who am con
I made you work here.

409
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,189
Get out.

410
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,438
Will wash you, you stink!

411
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,439
Come on, move!

412
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,232
What did you
to watch me like that?

413
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,715
I want more bosser for you.

414
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,749
See repeated?
- Put yourself in the ass, your job!

415
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,757
Son of a bitch, I'll kill you!

416
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,869
Get off me!

417
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,631
I'm going to fuck your mother
in this motherfucker!

418
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,751
I'll teach you
to pay like the others!

419
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,639
Get off me!

420
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,273
Come on, if you're a man!

421
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,833
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

422
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,314
Do not touch me!

423
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,393
Get out of here.

424
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,430
Go ahead and shoot.
- Tell him to back off.

425
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,993
The match will start.

426
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,550
A shot and I'm going.
- Get out!

427
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,392
You are the black, not the reduced!

428
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,913
I do not move if you pull it.

429
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,595
Get out, we told you!

430
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,433
You know who you talking about?

431
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,356
Lev Yashin!

432
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,238
Fuck,
Even if you're Maradona!

433
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,594
It struck him, the bastard!

434
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,875
Leave him alone!

435
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,959
Always fight.
- Do not bother.

436
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,479
Head mule!

437
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,514
They have beaten three.

438
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,388
It's none of your business.

439
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,151
This is worse.
We see nothing.

440
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,558
I'll find you someone.
I do what I can.

441
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,433
Yes, it is.

442
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,718
Stop screaming,
You decentralized me!

443
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,114
Still nothing!

444
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,549
Tarek, you hear me?
It's worse, like that!

445
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,479
In the other direction!

446
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,073
There's nothing!

447
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,149
You hear?

448
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,789
Tarek?

449
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,271
Goodbye.
- Take care of yourself.

450
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,233
Here, Nabil.

451
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,358
I spoke with Ba 'Moussa.

452
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,751
You start with him tomorrow.

453
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,192
Pay attention to this work,
that's all you have.

454
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,911
I do not like this guy.
- Think only at work.

455
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,759
You think I like it, me?

456
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,880
God help you, my daughter.
- Thank you.

457
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,759
It is you, Tamou?
- Yes.

458
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,193
Look at me, my son.

459
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,519
You will not forget me?

460
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,119
Do not forget me.
I'm your mother.

461
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,351
Come see me from time to time.

462
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,869
It here.

463
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,838
I'll wait.

464
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,509
You come?

465
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,709
Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.

466
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,159
Take care of yourself.

467
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,839
You're lucky,
a house all to yourself.

468
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,232
Your mother has worked,
the poor.

469
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,277
Khalil, let me go.
- Take it easy.

470
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,394
I told you what happened
my friend Adil Medina?

471
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,233
His father was a baker.

472
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,870
He went to Spain
and found an old

473
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,995
paid for everything himself,
Even his papers.

474
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,319
Now they live together.
- You could do it, you?

475
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,315
You have a good look at me?

476
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,639
Nabil, he could.

477
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,839
It has smooth skin,
chewable.

478
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,077
It is you who are always talking
to leave.

479
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,399
It tells you nothing
setting sail?

480
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,073
There, at least, you have rights.

481
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,831
Even if you work it,
you're paid.

482
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,918
If I wanted to go,
I should have gone with my mother.

483
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,959
Your mother? The fact that change
slum.

484
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,351
This is the lipstick Tamou?
- His dear mother.

485
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,198
Not kidding, put it down.

486
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,953
Let him, we laugh.

487
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,274
You're blocked or what?

488
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,669
You shit!

489
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,908
Beat it!

490
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,832
You've seen, it looks
a chick.

491
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,558
Here, the red of your mother.

492
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,598
It drives us to his villa
the bastard!

493
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,518
You spend your days
a damn thing!

494
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,639
Come on, fuck off!

495
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,273
Noureddine?
What's going on?

496
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,835
What sick one!

497
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,753
Ba 'Moussa, what he has,
Noureddine?

498
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,352
He's gone. Will work!

499
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,749
ll come back more?

500
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,429
Why do you ask?

501
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,994
My friend could take Yashin
its place. It pleases you.

502
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,111
His brother is still in jail?
- Yes.

503
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,036
It took for how much?
- 2 years.

504
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,588
It is good in mechanical?

505
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,953
No, but it's a hard worker,
you'll see.

506
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,719
You can take the test?
- This is good.

507
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,156
Work not scare him.
- All right, I said!

508
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,592
You let alone bosser
on the moped?

509
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,754
He quickly learned.
You'll see, it will start.

510
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,479
And if he can not do it,

511
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,156
what do I win?
- It is I who will repair.

512
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,913
You want to ride me
crafty.

513
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,630
Too much!

514
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,520
Let us have a look.
- Go ahead.

515
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,513
Come on, roll!

516
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,154
Madani!

517
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,952
We go to school embroidery
Ghislaine.

518
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,476
Ghislaine? It is always
in your head?

519
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,318
She was never released.

520
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,037
For my friend
I would go to the end of the world!

521
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,438
I just see a girl.
- Nobody gets.

522
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,789
Just two words.

523
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,629
If you want to talk to him,
expect July 1 h.

524
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,798
It's like his brother,
will not you imagine things.

525
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,349
I guess nothing.
Brother or not, no in between.

526
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,716
Do you think you are? Looks like
you keep a bank.

527
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,876
It breaks.

528
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,630
Fucking goalkeeper
How old fart!

529
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,989
He thinks he's a cop.

530
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,235
Accelerates!

531
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,752
I see,
he likes it or not.

532
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,716
Fouad, you dog.
Afraid to your sister?

533
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,629
Fouad, okay?
- Yashin, what are you doing here?

534
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,359
A race for Ba 'Moussa.

535
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,273
Ghislaine, okay?
- It's okay.

536
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,475
What kind of race?

537
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,678
It is true that you learn
sewing?

538
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,591
Ba 'Moussa sends you on an errand
with these clothes?

539
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,075
It asks you a problem?

540
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,674
I learned a lot.

541
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,439
It was full of customers,
bosser they want with it.

542
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,236
That's right, I'm busy.
- It's nice.

543
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,436
Our grandmother wants to find her a husband.
- What are you talking about?

544
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,798
Do not believe it delirium.
- Are you kidding?

545
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,794
I look? It takes someone
to get us out of this dump.

546
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,149
Why do you think
I accompany?

547
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,992
For no lousy
not defile his honor.

548
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,275
She's right.

549
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,354
Do not believe
he said anything.

550
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,439
Instead, he wants your good.
And your grandmother too.

551
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,472
Hello. Advance you.

552
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,349
Hello.

553
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,192
The Russians bombed Grozny!

554
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,593
Hush Said!

555
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,671
You did not open
perfume I brought you.

556
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,994
Mother, you did ...
- I'm open.

557
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,670
According to our initial information,

558
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,195
an armed commando
have hijacked a plane Iine

559
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,955
to one of the towers jumeIIes
New York.

560
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,794
A second plane
just hit I'autre turn.

561
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,359
They had them!

562
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,272
Pius 3,000 people
travaiIIent in this tower.

563
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,350
Support for Al Qaeda
is a religious obligation!

564
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,829
Fatwa of Sheikh Abu Oubaida
Moroccan!

565
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,516
Two Sikh men
were killed yesterday

566
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,915
in the State of Callfornle,
the United UNlTED.

567
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,638
According Ies investigators
iI would be racist crimes.

568
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,308
The assassins thought
Ies that victims were musuImanes.

569
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,915
Yashin!

570
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,633
Your brother is back!

571
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,953
It is near the coffee.

572
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,675
Go!

573
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,431
And work?
- I'll finish it later.

574
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,034
You're not moving from here.

575
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,236
Come on, it's good.

576
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,394
You grew up.

577
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,149
You've become a man.

578
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,399
When she returns?

579
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,838
Usually, it is
at this hour.

580
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,315
You're in a hurry?

581
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,190
You know what?
It was the parable now.

582
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,159
A ton of channels is captured
without any understanding.

583
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,836
You want to watch?
- He told you that he was interested not.

584
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,268
It does not matter.

585
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,675
Get away from me.

586
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,197
Everybody out!
- Calm down, father.

587
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,754
What do you want?

588
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,390
No, sir.

589
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,710
Okay, sir.

590
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,435
You Who are you?
What do you want?

591
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,029
Who's that?

592
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,508
My son ...

593
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,638
Thank you, my God.

594
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,760
I missed you so much,
My Hamid.

595
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,789
Congratulations!
- Thank you, Najat.

596
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,749
Sit down, my son.

597
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,196
You want to eat?

598
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,429
No thank you.
Tarek gave us tea.

599
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,909
You know that your brother works
in this debauched Ba 'Moussa?

600
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,278
Did you tell him?
- Yes.

601
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,070
I'll ask him
to find you a job

602
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,591
with friends in it,
mechanics.

603
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,553
That is, ask him.

604
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,354
It's not worth it.

605
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,354
My Friends
I have already found a job.

606
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,319
You work?
- Yes, in a drugstore.

607
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,754
Thank you, my God.

608
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,237
You've lost weight,
you do not eat in jail?

609
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,676
I'll make you
a good tagine.

610
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,396
Your brother bought
meat.

611
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,079
Another time.
Tonight I dine with my friends.

612
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,915
Who is this friend?

613
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,518
You can not really
dine with us?

614
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,319
They called me after the prayer.

615
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,828
As you wish, my son.

616
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,399
Najat no longer works.

617
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,552
Her husband forced her to stop.

618
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,873
To keep it at home.

619
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,478
That's what they say anyway.

620
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,155
Hamid, too
you treat your wife like that?

621
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,158
Answer. Why would you say anything?

622
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,309
My son ...

623
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,474
May God enlighten you, mother.

624
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,478
I have something important
to tell you.

625
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,556
Tell me.

626
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,235
I will move
my friend Noceir.

627
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,913
It's not a bit rushed?

628
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,354
I really have to go, mother.

629
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,551
It does what it Noceir?
- This is a serious and grown boy.

630
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,236
Tarek knows it may be.
He was goalkeeper Zriba slum.

631
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,390
I would not know.

632
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,996
He's my age.
He remembers very well of you.

633
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,759
I do not know him, I say.

634
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,315
What you got?
- Nothing.

635
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,351
We can meet
Nabil in tonight.

636
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,234
He now lives alone.

637
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,839
Fouad Khalil and will be there too.

638
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,072
It's been
that is not all together.

639
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,036
I can not.

640
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,878
Why do not you come
in Noceir?

641
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,918
I can tell you,
it is easy to find.

642
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,034
To pray with you?

643
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,750
If I want to pray,
I do alone.

644
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,078
Excuse me,
I'm late for work.

645
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,035
Your brother got weird.
He told you about the prison?

646
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,998
Not.
- How does it not?

647
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,272
No! Are you deaf or what?

648
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,799
Welcome, my son.

649
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,589
Right on time for dinner.
Thank you, my God.

650
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,315
I brought you fruit and vegetables.
- Thank you, my son.

651
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,512
Tomorrow, God willing,
I bring meat.

652
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,511
Are you hungry? Mange.

653
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,239
Thank you, mother. I've dined.

654
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,998
Father came out?
- God help him.

655
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,829
Said, you have listened to the tape
I gave you?

656
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,388
I listen to the news.
Arabic, French and English.

657
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,593
You want me to make?

658
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,632
Listen to it, you'll like.

659
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,593
You know where it comes from?

660
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,035
Of Mecca.

661
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,154
Hamid, you know Yashin
wants to like you?

662
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,311
He wants to live
his friend Nabil.

663
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,072
What? Nothing to see.

664
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,192
We talk for a long time.
- Calm down.

665
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,509
No need to argue.

666
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,998
You do not want
off the TV?

667
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,231
Why do you turn off?
You miss an episode ever!

668
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,115
Follow your soap!

669
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,148
It does not matter, mother.

670
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,319
I was just passing.

671
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,113
I have to meet my friends.
- Stay with us a little.

672
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,192
I'll be back.
Welcomes father to me.

673
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,868
Stay a little longer.

674
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,238
I can not make them wait.
I'll be back.

675
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,074
Goodbye, my son.
May God protect you.

676
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,879
Why you did it go?
- It's my fault?

677
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,157
Since returning,
it eludes us.

678
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,031
It is now reasonable
and you do not agree that it has changed.

679
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,196
Reasonable?

680
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,596
He wants to see us,
that's become reasonable?

681
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,235
We're almost done.

682
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,918
A loose connection to the spark plug.

683
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,879
Almost finished?

684
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,078
That's why I came.

685
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,953
Look at this beauty.

686
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,030
Kiss me.

687
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,958
Are you drunk or something?
- Kiss me, I tell you!

688
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,749
Leave him alone!

689
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,717
Get out!
- Get out!

690
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,834
You've pushed me.

691
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,954
You think you're hard?

692
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,073
So what ...

693
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,396
Do you believe?

694
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,471
I'll show you
is that hard here!

695
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,550
Son of a bitch!

696
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,033
Get off me, you dog!

697
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,357
I'll take care of your little ass
son of a bitch.

698
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,832
Do not move here, you hear?

699
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,590
Help me.

700
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,669
Tomorrow you will go to the garage
as usual.

701
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,951
Wait until a customer arrives
then open.

702
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,438
At the end of the day,
close and go.

703
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,359
As if nothing had happened.

704
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,150
Included?

705
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,229
He does nothing happened.

706
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,712
Hamid. Open.

707
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,994
I told you to go to the garage.

708
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,594
Dress up and follow me.
- Where?

709
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,795
Dressed.

710
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,038
We will see the brothers
who saved you.

711
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,636
You hurry.

712
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,715
Enter.

713
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,833
You feel better?
- Yes. Can we go?

714
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,197
Where?
- In the garage, as you told us.

715
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,350
After.

716
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,119
It's good that you came.

717
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,435
Me is Zaid.
He is Noceir.

718
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,989
We met yesterday.

719
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,349
But no longer think of the past.

720
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,632
God forgives
the sins of the repentant.

721
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,312
Come on.
Abu Zubair wants to talk to you.

722
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,118
Hamid told me your nickname.

723
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,069
But Rather
your real name, Tarek.

724
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:02,836
Please.

725
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,110
Here, you will find your way
practicing prayer.

726
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,356
The collective prayer strengthen
your confidence.

727
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,479
I also grew
in this neighborhood.

728
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,834
Like you, I've made mistakes
Youth. And I paid dearly.

729
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,273
But through prayer

730
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,471
and with the support
your new brothers,

731
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,479
you learn courage.

732
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,079
Today Hamid is strong.

733
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,392
You too can become strong.

734
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,316
Your brother Zaid guide you,
with God's help.

735
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,073
I'll come pay the patron.

736
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,712
What are you doing?
Come on, get the hell out.

737
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,592
Hamid said
to stay until the evening.

738
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,072
I do not want to stay here.

739
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,789
Nabil, hurry up!

740
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,956
Your soup disgusting
was fucking me the runs.

741
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,474
You always had the runs.
- Never before you know.

742
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,270
You'll dine?

743
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,076
That is good.

744
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,829
I will not be long.

745
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,638
You were not seen at the mosque.

746
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,354
Tomorrow morning, if God wills,
Hamid will pick you up at 7 am.

747
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,708
I have things to show you.

748
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,472
Be on time.
- What things?

749
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,718
It is you, Khalil?
- Yes, it's me.

750
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,473
And you Fouad?
- Yes.

751
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,149
What things?

752
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,799
I'll teach you
to defend yourself.

753
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,996
That nobody bothers you.
- Nobody bothers me.

754
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,675
And I have to work with my father.
- As you wish.

755
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,550
But if you can come
you will not regret it.

756
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,868
Fouad?
- I will come.

757
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,276
I leave you in peace.

758
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,673
See you tomorrow at 7 am.

759
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,396
Did you hear?

760
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,389
Bed early
to get up at dawn.

761
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,634
He wants us to léve at dawn.
It's crazy!

762
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,834
I'm going, anyway.

763
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,150
Me too.

764
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,472
That is, learning
to protect your little ass.

765
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,358
Shut up!
- Stop, Fouad!

766
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,955
There's not just me here.

767
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,549
What is this circus?

768
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,231
What are you talking about?
- You stop the play.

769
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,555
You think you're at the movies?

770
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,997
In real bastons,
this crap does not work.

771
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,835
You want to continue to shine
pumps as a slave?

772
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,228
And you, what do you do?

773
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,436
Stay.

774
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,915
Where you going?

775
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,910
We must get back to work.
- The program has changed.

776
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,589
You'll stay with us.

777
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,593
We will pray and we have lunch together
with the will of God.

778
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,628
I do not have time.
Fouad, here we go.

779
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,268
Fouad, you're welcome.

780
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,950
You decide what?

781
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,869
I remain.

782
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,595
Hi, guys.

783
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,949
Please.

784
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,878
We are faithful
and believe in the oneness of Allah.

785
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,431
We reject the idols
and do not believe in Allah.

786
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,030
We are committed
neither land nor a tribe

787
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,394
or even in the area.

788
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,552
Our loyalty is to Allah,

789
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,830
his prophet and faithful,
wherever they are.

790
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,428
The Jews, the Crusaders
and apostate governments

791
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,950
attempt to weaken
Islamic nation.

792
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,869
But they will fail.

793
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,712
Allah has promised victory
Muslims

794
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,716
and defeat and punishment
for the disbelievers.

795
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,832
The victory will go to those who follow
the way of the prophets

796
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,755
and apply the precepts
the prophet of lslam.

797
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,595
Stay with me.

798
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,629
Just your brother.

799
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,190
Tarek.

800
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,835
Take your place.

801
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,959
Make a place for our brother.

802
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,988
I remember you well.

803
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,073
You played with the team the Stars.

804
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,749
I said Hamid.

805
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,195
I was also goalkeeper.
I liked your style.

806
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,789
You still play?

807
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:41,991
Not.

808
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,069
Neither do I.

809
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,278
But I sometimes attends games.

810
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,315
You always have
this photo of Yashin?

811
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,309
You kept?

812
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,034
Where'd you get it?
- Azzedine had given me.

813
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,954
What Azzedine? Touhami?

814
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,918
He was a friend
our big brother Karim.

815
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,195
It was the star of the neighborhood.

816
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,635
It would be in the national team
if he had been disciplined.

817
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,153
You have heard, my brothers?

818
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,550
Discipline
is the key to success.

819
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,116
You're not out?

820
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,068
I met your mother.
She was worried.

821
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,279
I reassured
but you should go see.

822
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,636
And Hamid?

823
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,115
I have not seen.

824
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,674
Nobody asks questions.
The police arrested her research.

825
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,073
You knew Ba 'Moussa
had a brother?

826
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,075
It is he who takes care of the garage.
He'll sell everything.

827
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,670
Zemama provides more than him.
- The referee kidding, there was penalty.

828
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,079
Go ahead, Aboucharouane!

829
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,036
Tire, asshole.

830
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,436
Do not you think it odd
Tarek they call you?

831
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,433
lmagine Hamid reapplies.

832
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,712
So what?
- It will not please him.

833
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,510
It is not his business.
- And if he said to Abu Zubair?

834
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,159
Not break my head with it!

835
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,836
There, you happy?
- Are you crazy? Pass me that joint.

836
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,678
You have seen how
Zaid broke the board?

837
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,428
All of a sudden, and he felt nothing.
Like that!

838
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,078
It must be black belt.

839
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,036
At least! Even Bruce Lee
would not the weight.

840
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,279
Noceir said
he learned in Belgium.

841
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,390
It was in Belgium?
- Damn, you're fucked up the joint.

842
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,873
Smoke and shut up,
head of cabbage.

843
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,316
Go!

844
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,749
That is a shot!

845
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,196
He told you what Abu Zubair
when you were alone?

846
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,789
He talks too much.

847
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,598
I know what you did.

848
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,753
But I'm not here
to judge you.

849
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,193
And it is not your fault.

850
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,516
You lived with poached
and libertines.

851
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,758
They are criminals,
not you.

852
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,590
This would have happened if you had grown up
in a healthy environment,

853
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,356
with faithful who fear
the anger of Allah?

854
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,670
I do not think so.

855
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,269
But today,

856
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,235
you can
to atone for your sins

857
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,638
and start
a new life

858
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,951
as if nothing had happened.

859
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,188
Recite your incantations.

860
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,796
They will be useful
for your learning.

861
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,508
Glorify Allah.

862
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,197
How the potatoes?
- 3 dirhams.

863
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,834
Put me two pounds.

864
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,509
You saw Amine?
- Yes.

865
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,837
Since Real left
nobody dares to sell shit.

866
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,318
It happens even
to look at ourselves.

867
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,948
May God guide.

868
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,153
I'll see you later.
- God willing.

869
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,397
I only listen to the news,
Arabic, French and English.

870
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,395
Do not listen to these more silliness.
They will disturb the mind.

871
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,913
Come with me to the mosque,
you'll feel better.

872
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,635
And stop shave.

873
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,679
You think you're a woman?

874
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,353
Said, sit down!

875
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,909
Calm down.

876
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,356
Do not blame him.
This is because he does not see you anymore.

877
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,080
I'm proud of you, you took
the same way as your brother.

878
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,994
This is not the way
my brother.

879
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,194
This is the real Muslims
who fear Allah.

880
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,315
You're right.

881
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,232
But why
you do not come to see us?

882
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,355
Even more
for couscous Friday.

883
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,394
We thank You, God,
for this food.

884
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,636
What a delight.

885
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,515
Who cooked?

886
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,595
Our brother Nabil.

887
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,749
A real cook.

888
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,550
And a real man.

889
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,117
I decided to move
in and Tarek Nabil.

890
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,710
That is good.

891
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,838
Group life
is very important.

892
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,350
Our brothers should learn
to live in community.

893
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,358
The problem is my sister
and my grandmother.

894
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,715
They will be alone.

895
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,679
My grandmother is sick.
- May Allah heal.

896
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:03,876
Do not worry.

897
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,555
We have a doctor sister.

898
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,399
She will visit him.

899
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,354
Allah bestows you.
- Solidarity is a duty.

900
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,715
Why are we brothers?

901
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,953
We help each other.

902
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,037
And help our families
if necessary.

903
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,914
Abu Zubair has an eye on you.

904
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,912
He knows that you are
at the beginning of learning.

905
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,155
And, thank God,
You are on the right path.

906
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,309
Hurry.

907
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,875
I do my ablutions and I arrive.

908
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,669
Wait.

909
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,389
Only you.

910
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,190
You come too Abu Zubair.
- What?

911
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,074
All brothers have noticed.
- This is the Emir, this is normal.

912
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,357
This is our Emir all.

913
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,190
Now you sit
and as you listen to everyone.

914
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,915
Included?

915
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,635
It's not my fault that Abu Zubair
does not care about you.

916
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,834
Excuse me,
I must wash.

917
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,670
Stop it!

918
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,475
Greet.

919
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,749
Greet!

920
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,755
Come dressed up!

921
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,832
Nabil, and Tarek Fouad.

922
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,948
I have good news for you.

923
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,954
You will work with us.

924
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,479
I talked to Abu Zubair
and he agreed.

925
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,676
Do not be angry
and get paradise.

926
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,872
The enemies of Allah said
war lslam

927
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,473
and Muslims.

928
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,760
They talk about peace and justice
in the world.

929
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:30,229
The truth is that the disbelievers
apostates and their vassals

930
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,872
want to deceive the Islamic nation,
destroy the appeal of lslam.

931
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,632
They rusent but Allah triumph
for His ruse is unstoppable.

932
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,109
Our brothers and sisters are
persecuted in Bosnia, Palestine,

933
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,716
lraq in Chechnya,

934
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,032
Kashmir, Afghanistan ...
Our children are slaughtered!

935
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,908
Until when will we accept
the indignation?

936
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,555
Until when?

937
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,552
Allah is our only recourse!

938
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,393
Allah is our only recourse!

939
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,711
You okay, Ghislaine?
- Yes, thank God.

940
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,555
You always go
school of embroidery?

941
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,314
No, I work at home.

942
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,349
And I sell.

943
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,549
That is good.

944
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,755
Ghislaine, what do you do?
Come and help us.

945
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,310
I'm coming.

946
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,355
I saw you near the mosque.
You sell tapes?

947
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,551
You saw us?
You should have come.

948
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,354
I do not want to disturb you.
- On the contrary.

949
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,435
Ghislaine!

950
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,436
What?

951
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,030
May Allah reward.

952
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,630
Since grandmother is sick,
they send us to eat.

953
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,109
You know that a cousin of Rabat
asked Ghislaine hand?

954
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,514
This is a brother too.

955
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,434
It sells computers

956
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,708
and it was his apartment.

957
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,395
Thanks be to God.

958
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,154
Fight corruption
and depravity in this country!

959
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,670
Flee!
Apostates police!

960
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,391
God is great!

961
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,508
They struck you too?

962
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,150
No, it's okay.

963
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,035
God be praised.

964
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,232
Who fears Allah
not afraid of men.

965
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,515
You're right.

966
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,233
Yesterday, your brothers
corrected a drunkard,

967
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,157
an apostate who insulted
the majesty of Allah.

968
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,236
Apostates police
some brothers were arrested.

969
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,157
But we are on the right track.
They are depraved.

970
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,956
The power is in the service
the enemies of Allah.

971
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,711
We will not let
prohibit us

972
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,394
encourage virtue
and combat vice.

973
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,189
And those arrétés?
- Most have been released.

974
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,750
We are stronger than they
and they know it.

975
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,599
Death does not scare us.

976
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,315
We are not afraid
Allah Almighty.

977
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,276
They know that we love death
as they love life.

978
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,759
They are terrified
by our movement

979
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,156
that continues to grow.

980
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,992
And you, my children,
are part of this wave.

981
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,678
With God's help,
they can not reach you.

982
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,192
Look at your brother.

983
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,069
Even experienced,
it prefers to hide.

984
01:16:01,760 -> 01:16:05,673
It is the prerogative of the great warriors
whom Allah carries in his esteem.

985
01:16:06,400 -> 01:16:10,109
This is the state of mind that allows
better preparation for martyrdom.

986
01:16:12,080 -> 01:16:16,039
You have these qualities,
and God is with you.

987
01:16:34,520 -> 01:16:36,636
What do you want?
- I want to talk to Nabil.

988
01:16:38,720 -> 01:16:41,359
Why?
- I gotta tell you something.

989
01:16:41,520 -> 01:16:43,351
Speak!
- To you alone.

990
01:16:48,880 -> 01:16:50,791
What did she tell you?
- She wants to see you.

991
01:16:53,080 -> 01:16:56,470
Tell him to leave the neighborhood
immediately. Do you understand?

992
01:16:57,720 -> 01:17:00,712
Tell him that if I want to see,
I know where to find it.

993
01:17:33,560 -> 01:17:35,790
It is not lawful,
regardless of its content.

994
01:17:36,480 -> 01:17:38,232
You're right,
should not be open.

995
01:17:38,560 -> 01:17:41,632
Ask Zaid.
- Yes, let's ask him.

996
01:17:42,080 -> 01:17:44,469
One day, I heard:
'' The money from adultery is illegal.''

997
01:17:45,800 -> 01:17:47,233
What can it hold?

998
01:17:47,960 -> 01:17:49,871
Whatever.
It is not halal, that's all.

999
01:18:02,000 -> 01:18:03,115
Who is it?

1000
01:18:07,960 -> 01:18:09,712
Remember, children lslam,

1001
01:18:10,280 -> 01:18:13,397
the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy
is winning our country

1002
01:18:14,160 -> 01:18:16,628
to destroy the last vestiges
our Islamic civilization.

1003
01:18:17,800 -> 01:18:19,472
And every Muslim to fight

1004
01:18:19,880 -> 01:18:22,348
who refuses to resign
against this evil plot.

1005
01:18:23,120 -> 01:18:26,476
See how they have decimated
Islamic state in Afghanistan.

1006
01:18:27,440 -> 01:18:30,671
You surely follow, through
media, their preparations for invasion

1007
01:18:30,840 -> 01:18:33,559
Baghdad, Mesopotamia,
cradle of Islamic Caliphate.

1008
01:18:34,520 -> 01:18:36,078
As for our chére homeland
Morocco,

1009
01:18:36,240 -> 01:18:38,515
Mujahideen
are persecuted,

1010
01:18:39,400 -> 01:18:40,753
tortured in prisons,

1011
01:18:43,520 -> 01:18:45,192
no one responds.

1012
01:18:46,640 -> 01:18:48,073
Have we lost so much faith?

1013
01:18:48,560 -> 01:18:51,393
What happened to
our love for lslam?

1014
01:18:52,360 -> 01:18:55,079
Is not it time to inflict
a lesson to these traitors?

1015
01:18:56,000 -> 01:18:58,878
Allah says:
'' Oh, you believers

1016
01:19:00,080 -> 01:19:02,355
fight the unbelievers
around you

1017
01:19:02,640 -> 01:19:04,392
and they feel you
hardness''.

1018
01:19:04,640 -> 01:19:06,995
And the Holy Prophet, the salvation of Allah
be upon him ...

1019
01:19:09,200 -> 01:19:11,350
... Says:'' If you give
Jihad,

1020
01:19:11,720 -> 01:19:15,633
Allah will plunge you into the indignity
until you resume the fight.''

1021
01:19:16,560 -> 01:19:17,913
Take care,
children lslam,

1022
01:19:18,200 -> 01:19:20,350
not to become
like this

1023
01:19:20,600 -> 01:19:24,275
clinging to life on earth and
afraid to join the afterlife as martyrs.

1024
01:19:24,920 -> 01:19:28,196
So fly, God horses,
and the gates of heaven will be opened to you.

1025
01:19:28,480 -> 01:19:30,311
May Allah accept us
martyrs

1026
01:19:30,840 -> 01:19:32,193
and opens
the gates of paradise.

1027
01:19:32,560 -> 01:19:34,278
Amen.
- Amen.

1028
01:19:35,160 -> 01:19:36,752
I pray to Allah
make you triumph

1029
01:19:37,080 -> 01:19:38,354
unabated.

1030
01:19:57,800 -> 01:19:59,597
This night is not
a night like any other.

1031
01:20:00,000 -> 01:20:01,831
I tell you
great news.

1032
01:20:02,720 -> 01:20:05,075
Thanks to Allah,
you have been chosen

1033
01:20:05,400 -> 01:20:07,197
among many
our brothers

1034
01:20:08,200 -> 01:20:10,760
to make his pride
the nation of lslam

1035
01:20:11,600 -> 01:20:13,397
and to die as martyrs.

1036
01:20:14,360 -> 01:20:17,318
You are the hopes of lslam
on this earth.

1037
01:20:17,840 -> 01:20:20,877
And, God willing, the gates of heaven
will be wide open.

1038
01:20:21,720 -> 01:20:22,869
I'm happy for you.

1039
01:20:24,000 -> 01:20:24,989
Allah is great!

1040
01:20:25,480 -> 01:20:26,799
Allah we will triumph!

1041
01:20:33,240 -> 01:20:34,116
Allah is great!

1042
01:20:35,120 -> 01:20:36,473
Allah we will triumph!

1043
01:20:55,560 -> 01:20:57,790
God horses
are virtue

1044
01:20:57,960 -> 01:20:59,837
up to
the resurrection.

1045
01:21:00,800 -> 01:21:02,995
The Hi Allah be upon you.

1046
01:21:15,320 -> 01:21:17,151
It does not tell us
how this man was.

1047
01:21:17,760 -> 01:21:19,637
You saw how Abu Zubair
before him?

1048
01:21:20,200 -> 01:21:21,474
Me too, it surprised me.

1049
01:21:23,160 -> 01:21:24,388
It was he who chose us?

1050
01:21:25,200 -> 01:21:28,078
Abu Zubair had to tell him about us
and obtained his consent.

1051
01:21:31,000 -> 01:21:31,989
You can go out with me?

1052
01:21:33,440 -> 01:21:35,396
Why?
- I want to talk to you.

1053
01:21:53,560 -> 01:21:54,310
What?

1054
01:21:55,000 -> 01:21:55,955
You gonna go?

1055
01:21:57,120 -> 01:21:58,109
Are you really gonna do?

1056
01:21:59,280 -> 01:22:00,599
You thought our mother?

1057
01:22:01,320 -> 01:22:02,435
She will never recover.

1058
01:22:02,600 -> 01:22:03,635
They have chosen us.

1059
01:22:03,800 -> 01:22:04,835
Chosen?

1060
01:22:06,160 -> 01:22:07,673
You did not hear
Abu Zubair?

1061
01:22:08,200 -> 01:22:09,713
It was chosen for martyrdom.

1062
01:22:10,560 -> 01:22:12,551
Are you scared?
- That's not the point.

1063
01:22:12,720 -> 01:22:15,154
I'm talking about our mother.
- And I'm talking about martyrdom.

1064
01:22:18,480 -> 01:22:19,469
I do not fear me.

1065
01:22:20,880 -> 01:22:21,790
Not afraid?

1066
01:22:26,040 -> 01:22:27,519
Looks like you're shaking.

1067
01:22:29,880 -> 01:22:31,996
If you're scared,
stay with our mother.

1068
01:22:33,080 -> 01:22:34,433
I do fear Allah.

1069
01:22:35,160 -> 01:22:36,195
You got it?

1070
01:22:53,640 -> 01:22:55,232
May 9, God willing,

1071
01:22:55,800 -> 01:22:58,268
in a few days,

1072
01:22:58,680 -> 01:23:00,875
you will become
the heroes of this nation

1073
01:23:01,120 -> 01:23:02,712
and will be welcomed in heaven

1074
01:23:03,440 -> 01:23:07,228
with the martyrs
who have sacrificed for our nation.

1075
01:23:07,760 -> 01:23:10,320
Right now, they bask
delights in the gardens of Eden.

1076
01:23:10,520 -> 01:23:12,078
But to achieve this honor,

1077
01:23:12,320 -> 01:23:13,799
it will be on your guard.

1078
01:23:15,160 -> 01:23:18,232
In the coming time,
be careful

1079
01:23:19,480 -> 01:23:21,516
and follow
security measures.

1080
01:23:22,840 -> 01:23:26,150
Do not leave the area,
avoid discussions in public,

1081
01:23:26,520 -> 01:23:28,556
avoid talking to strangers.

1082
01:23:29,320 -> 01:23:31,515
You can visit
your loved ones,

1083
01:23:31,680 -> 01:23:32,715
but you linger.

1084
01:23:33,200 -> 01:23:35,316
Do not worry
for the future of your family.

1085
01:23:37,120 -> 01:23:38,997
Your brothers will take care of them.

1086
01:23:57,200 -> 01:23:59,430
You could remove
when your brothers are there.

1087
01:23:59,960 -> 01:24:00,676
You hear?

1088
01:24:02,120 -> 01:24:03,519
Removed these headphones!

1089
01:24:09,520 -> 01:24:10,475
We have to go.

1090
01:24:11,280 -> 01:24:13,919
Stay a little, it's been
I've not seen together.

1091
01:24:14,520 -> 01:24:15,589
We gotta go.

1092
01:24:15,960 -> 01:24:18,030
Wait at least
your father home.

1093
01:24:18,200 -> 01:24:20,589
ll surely be back later.
Or not at all.

1094
01:24:23,040 -> 01:24:25,190
Oh, and if you go
near a pharmacy,

1095
01:24:25,400 -> 01:24:27,118
Buy Me
two boxes of medicines.

1096
01:24:34,800 -> 01:24:36,028
Like this.

1097
01:24:36,400 -> 01:24:37,753
Here the order.

1098
01:24:40,480 -> 01:24:41,754
What do you have?

1099
01:24:44,760 -> 01:24:45,795
Okay, mother.

1100
01:24:46,240 -> 01:24:47,958
Do not make me wait,
I need it.

1101
01:24:48,800 -> 01:24:50,074
May Allah bless you, my son.

1102
01:24:50,720 -> 01:24:51,789
Goodbye.

1103
01:24:53,240 -> 01:24:54,639
God bless you.

1104
01:24:58,920 -> 01:25:00,911
Goodbye, mother.
- God bless you, my son.

1105
01:25:04,360 -> 01:25:06,078
May God preserve you!

1106
01:25:08,240 -> 01:25:09,309
Take care of yourself.

1107
01:25:11,800 -> 01:25:12,949
How do I know?

1108
01:25:14,760 -> 01:25:15,556
Okay.

1109
01:25:18,160 -> 01:25:19,115
God willing.

1110
01:25:20,440 -> 01:25:21,668
Guidelines is expected.

1111
01:25:25,080 -> 01:25:26,308
Zaid.

1112
01:25:36,400 -> 01:25:40,188
The operation was postponed
at a future date.

1113
01:25:41,400 -> 01:25:43,994
Zaid will explain.
I must go.

1114
01:25:45,200 -> 01:25:46,679
Soon, God willing.

1115
01:25:48,640 -> 01:25:50,551
The transaction must take place
under the best conditions.

1116
01:25:51,320 -> 01:25:52,958
Tomorrow we hit the road at dawn.

1117
01:25:53,400 -> 01:25:55,516
We need to prepare ourselves
for martyrdom.

1118
01:25:56,920 -> 01:25:58,319
May Allah give us strength.

1119
01:26:11,440 -> 01:26:14,398
We thank you, God,
and to Thee we return.

1120
01:26:24,400 -> 01:26:26,038
This is the first time
I'm in town.

1121
01:26:42,800 -> 01:26:44,199
It is great!

1122
01:26:45,240 -> 01:26:46,514
God alone is great.

1123
01:26:52,800 -> 01:26:53,630
Watch!

1124
01:26:56,000 -> 01:26:56,989
Look at these villas.

1125
01:26:58,560 -> 01:27:01,552
These good these drivers,
this luxury comes from Europe.

1126
01:27:03,160 -> 01:27:06,118
Where would that their wealth
if they do not steal the people?

1127
01:27:07,200 -> 01:27:10,590
They exploit your sweat,
yours and mine.

1128
01:27:12,240 -> 01:27:15,471
But they will burn in hell with
their entire fortune amassed here below.

1129
01:27:16,320 -> 01:27:18,993
And it is for us the doors
paradise will open.

1130
01:27:20,760 -> 01:27:24,355
Ie Seion protocoIe RoyaI,
Ie his Majesty King Mohammed VI

1132
01:27:28,160 -> 01:27:30,958
in honor of his father,
Ie late King Hassan II.

1133
01:27:31,240 -> 01:27:34,437
The UK is preparing to céIébrer
joy in the birth Ia.

1134
01:27:35,800 -> 01:27:39,554
Throughout Ia capitaIe, festivities
important were organized ...

1135
01:28:08,600 -> 01:28:09,635
You've seen those trees!

1136
01:28:10,200 -> 01:28:11,155
What kind!

1137
01:28:12,040 -> 01:28:13,189
Come, my brothers.

1138
01:28:14,080 -> 01:28:15,149
Hamid, come and help me.

1139
01:29:08,440 -> 01:29:10,795
You abandoned
famiIy and money

1140
01:29:11,040 -> 01:29:14,157
and you went to
Ie round earth Ia

1141
01:29:15,040 -> 01:29:19,113
Paroies your and your actions towards AIIah
were sincere

1142
01:29:27,920 -> 01:29:32,118
Your heart is not attached to Iife,
IUI does not value

1143
01:29:32,680 -> 01:29:36,878
You're like Abu Dujana, hero
charismatic large bataiIIes ...

1144
01:29:45,320 -> 01:29:46,753
In winter, it is covered with snow here.

1145
01:29:48,120 -> 01:29:49,109
Everything is white.

1146
01:29:50,080 -> 01:29:51,991
We no longer distinguish
earth from the skies.

1147
01:29:53,120 -> 01:29:54,269
Allah is unique.

1148
01:29:56,760 -> 01:30:00,275
These wonders on earth are nothing
next to those of the above

1149
01:30:01,200 -> 01:30:02,599
full of wonders

1150
01:30:03,360 -> 01:30:04,998
you've never seen

1151
01:30:06,080 -> 01:30:07,479
nor heard.

1152
01:30:13,280 -> 01:30:14,998
God willing,
the operation will be

1153
01:30:16,440 -> 01:30:17,998
Friday, May 16

1154
01:30:22,480 -> 01:30:23,435
Hamid, okay?

1155
01:30:25,400 -> 01:30:26,355
It's nothing.

1156
01:30:27,520 -> 01:30:29,476
I just drank
a little too much coffee.

1157
01:30:35,200 -> 01:30:36,349
Allah is with us.

1158
01:31:04,520 -> 01:31:05,396
You sleep?

1159
01:31:07,640 -> 01:31:09,073
No, why?

1160
01:31:10,680 -> 01:31:11,590
In your opinion ...

1161
01:31:12,600 -> 01:31:13,476
What?

1162
01:31:16,000 -> 01:31:19,072
She thinks what, Ghislaine, When
she'll know I died a martyr?

1163
01:31:20,040 -> 01:31:21,109
That is to say?

1164
01:31:22,840 -> 01:31:26,150
It Will Be Sad? Happy?
How does it take?

1165
01:31:28,000 -> 01:31:30,036
ll are plenty in paradise.

1166
01:31:30,920 -> 01:31:33,639
Hundreds of Ghislaine,
thousands In ...

1167
01:31:52,000 -> 01:31:52,955
Tarek!

1168
01:31:56,000 -> 01:31:58,195
Who is it?
- That's me. Come on.

1169
01:32:00,160 -> 01:32:01,957
What are you doing?
- Nothing sleep.

1170
01:32:06,480 -> 01:32:08,118
What are you doing?
- Do not shout.

1171
01:32:08,600 -> 01:32:10,272
Tell me what happens.

1172
01:32:12,320 -> 01:32:13,389
Do not do it.

1173
01:32:14,080 -> 01:32:16,071
Tarek, listen to me.
Do not do it.

1174
01:32:16,880 -> 01:32:18,108
Do not get explode.

1175
01:32:18,640 -> 01:32:19,868
What are you doing?

1176
01:32:20,400 -> 01:32:21,469
It's martyrdom that is,

1177
01:32:21,880 -> 01:32:24,075
it is on the verge of heaven.

1178
01:32:24,960 -> 01:32:27,428
We talk about us
it will be remembered.

1179
01:32:28,080 -> 01:32:30,958
What do you want more?
- I will not let you.

1180
01:32:31,960 -> 01:32:33,109
You know where we're going?

1181
01:32:33,840 -> 01:32:34,750
It will explode.

1182
01:32:35,280 -> 01:32:36,713
You realize it or not?

1183
01:32:39,440 -> 01:32:40,668
You can leave if you want.

1184
01:32:41,800 -> 01:32:43,358
But you heard
what was said by the Emir.

1185
01:32:44,160 -> 01:32:46,549
Whoever retracts after having learned
the details of the transaction

1186
01:32:47,440 -> 01:32:48,634
can not stay alive.

1187
01:32:52,760 -> 01:32:53,715
A problem?

1188
01:32:55,560 -> 01:32:56,356
No, it's okay.

1189
01:32:57,200 -> 01:32:58,474
I had discomfort.

1190
01:32:59,600 -> 01:33:00,669
I feel better now.

1191
01:33:02,760 -> 01:33:04,671
Tarek, go back to your tent.

1192
01:33:05,840 -> 01:33:07,478
We're going for a ride
your brother and me.

1193
01:33:28,120 -> 01:33:28,950
Take.

1194
01:33:35,800 -> 01:33:36,710
Strike.

1195
01:33:55,720 -> 01:33:56,709
Not bent.

1196
01:33:58,080 -> 01:33:59,479
And hardened your heart.

1197
01:34:12,280 -> 01:34:13,269
Wait.

1198
01:34:19,960 -> 01:34:21,109
May Allah reward you.

1199
01:34:23,640 -> 01:34:25,153
We are all counting on you.

1200
01:34:26,440 -> 01:34:27,668
Abu Zubair first.

1201
01:34:28,520 -> 01:34:30,954
Moreover, it made you
head of the operation.

1202
01:34:32,760 -> 01:34:33,875
I will not disappoint.

1203
01:34:34,640 -> 01:34:35,709
I have no doubt.

1204
01:34:49,960 -> 01:34:50,836
GB

1205
01:35:22,480 -> 01:35:23,515
The address of my mother.

1206
01:35:24,560 -> 01:35:26,118
It may be that she moved.

1207
01:35:26,840 -> 01:35:29,035
It will have all your stuff
do not worry.

1208
01:35:30,160 -> 01:35:31,309
We go.

1209
01:35:32,120 -> 01:35:33,269
Leave your bags here.

1210
01:35:38,640 -> 01:35:39,755
After you.

1211
01:35:45,080 -> 01:35:46,354
Straight.

1212
01:36:01,400 -> 01:36:02,310
Go ahead, my brothers.

1213
01:36:28,120 -> 01:36:29,678
Welcome.

1214
01:36:49,680 -> 01:36:52,592
Some think it is
with practice.

1215
01:36:52,840 -> 01:36:55,957
I tell them iA
to this conviction aside.

1216
01:36:56,440 -> 01:36:58,829
iI must Pius
to succeed in this type of action.

1217
01:37:01,760 -> 01:37:03,193
Knowledge and harmony

1218
01:37:03,360 -> 01:37:06,432
Ies among members of a ceIIuIe,
who must learn

1219
01:37:06,840 -> 01:37:08,956
living ensembIe
and to know.

1220
01:37:09,720 -> 01:37:11,358
You have an idea
the place of the operation?

1221
01:37:13,240 -> 01:37:14,912
I heard we were going
blow themselves

1222
01:37:15,440 -> 01:37:16,953
purpose I do not know
not exactly where.

1223
01:37:17,160 -> 01:37:18,559
I think it's a bar.

1224
01:37:18,920 -> 01:37:21,195
On after you, there will be
that Jews and Christians?

1225
01:37:22,240 -> 01:37:24,276
In my opinion, there will also
Muslims.

1226
01:37:24,640 -> 01:37:26,517
It will be martyrs
if Muslims are killed?

1227
01:37:26,800 -> 01:37:27,915
I do not know.

1228
01:37:28,240 -> 01:37:30,754
A Muslim who drinks
is a Muslim, right?

1229
01:37:31,360 -> 01:37:32,475
What is the problem?

1230
01:37:33,680 -> 01:37:36,558
Those who drink alcohol and combine
Jews and Christians are Muslims?

1231
01:37:36,760 -> 01:37:37,875
They are apostates.

1232
01:37:38,520 -> 01:37:41,956
And even if they were Muslims,
they help us to achieve our enemies.

1233
01:37:42,960 -> 01:37:45,269
It is therefore permissible to kill them.

1234
01:37:47,040 -> 01:37:48,553
Join the group.

1235
01:38:54,400 -> 01:38:56,152
Set your watches 10:52.

1236
01:40:23,920 -> 01:40:25,148
Go to heaven.

1237
01:40:32,600 -> 01:40:33,919
Hamid, okay?

1238
01:40:34,280 -> 01:40:36,999
You are beautiful kids like that
and there are taxis waiting for you.

1239
01:40:37,240 -> 01:40:39,879
Take us with you
one air exchange.

1240
01:40:43,760 -> 01:40:45,591
It was not the right
have fun, too?

1241
01:40:46,800 -> 01:40:47,994
I'll remember.

1242
01:41:47,840 -> 01:41:48,909
God willing.

1243
01:42:36,760 -> 01:42:37,829
Fouad.

1244
01:43:05,240 -> 01:43:06,559
Join us
in two minutes.

1245
01:43:20,600 -> 01:43:21,635
Get off me.

1246
01:44:15,480 -> 01:44:16,196
Yes, sir?

1247
01:52:46,040 -> 01:52:49,919
