1
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,015
Hello!

2
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,268
A guy's out by the fig tree.

3
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,999
- Who?
- I don't know.

4
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,842
Still there?

5
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,023
Must be an inspector.
Nobody knows him.

6
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,623
Ya better tell your dad.

7
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,054
Dédé, go tell Grampa.

8
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,621
No, tell Uncle Jules first.

9
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,891
Take some grapes!

10
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,535
There's a guy by the fig tree.

11
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,668
- So?
- Dad doesn't know him.

12
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,577
I'll bet he's an inspector.

13
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,648
Anna, go warn Grampa.

14
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,162
Grampa, got anything in the yard?
A stranger's hanging around.

15
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,234
They must've seen me
at Faugat this morning.

16
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,535
Me, I didn't see them.
I fish wherever I want!

17
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,175
- What's it all about?
- I dunno.

18
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,499
I don't know if it's this shack.

19
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,608
But you made me wait
in this heat for an hour!

20
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,540
This must be it.

21
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,041
Where are you going,
barging in like this?

22
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,810
Do you know who I am?

23
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,520
I don't care! I don't know you!

24
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,551
Board of Health!

25
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,020
Put that away and bug off!
You should've shown it sooner!

26
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,026
You know I've the right to search.

27
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,430
Should've shown your lD
and a warrant first.

28
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,703
- I have one.
- It's too goddamn late!

29
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,307
I found you breaking in here like thieves!

30
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,806
Maybe you wanted to steal something!

31
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
I'm gonna kick your asses out of here!

32
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,542
Now he says we're thieves?

33
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,739
What's your name?

34
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,784
I won't tell you!
What's this tyranny?

35
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,579
This is my place.

36
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,257
- Mrs. Soldino?
- Yes.

37
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,120
- Board of Health. May we come in?
- Of course.

38
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,061
- What do you want to see?
- Nothing...

39
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,740
Your husband went fishing
this morning?

40
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,844
Well, when he got up this morning...

41
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,572
he had a pain in his hand
and when he wanted...

42
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,773
Wanted what?

43
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,152
When he wanted...

44
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,728
Don't you see she's senile?
She's my mother-in-law.

45
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,027
You're upsetting everybody!

46
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,825
Come on, get lost!

47
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,836
We're quietly eating
and they show up like gangsters!

48
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,630
We'll see about this at the station.

49
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,243
OK! And I'll file a complaint
for illegal entry.

50
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,674
- No one will believe you.
- They will!

51
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,549
I'll give you as much hell
as you gave us!

52
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,889
Hassling us for what?
They don't even know!

53
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,965
- You'll pay dearly for this!
- I doubt it.

54
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,803
- Come on, Jules...
- Coming!

55
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,831
As soon as they leave us alone.

56
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,907
Looking in shacks!
To find what?

57
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,044
You make me laugh!

58
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,645
You'll see!

59
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,179
I fooled 'em.
I went through the hole and...

60
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,214
got the basket from the shack.

61
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,750
It's under the bed.

62
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,854
I'm coming!

63
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,659
They came to hassle your dad?

64
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,465
Jules took care of 'em.
Believe me!

65
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,327
The mistral's blowing again.

66
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,913
I heard you were here.

67
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,582
How are you, Louis?

68
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,579
Are you here for a while?

69
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,807
Yes.

70
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,350
How long?

71
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,650
A little while.

72
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,026
So long!

73
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,996
I meant some time ago,
not yesterday.

74
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,668
You're sure somebody!

75
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,205
When I was 20, I could jump in the water
and jump out dry!

76
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,243
Listen to him! What a guy!

77
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,349
I'll go check.

78
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,279
He already met
the Paris train yesterday.

79
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,546
- Who's he expecting?
- His wife.

80
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,020
- Doesn't he know when?
- He says he doesn't.

81
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,017
- How are you, beautiful?
- How'd you know when I was coming?

82
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,247
- I came every morning.
- For the past 5 days?

83
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,887
You're sweet.

84
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,032
He didn't seem like a skirt-chaser
but he sure found a pretty girl.

85
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,899
In Paris there are lots like her.

86
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,771
Did they recognize you?

87
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,137
They forgot me a bit after 1 2 years,
but once they saw me...

88
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,810
Do you recognize me?

89
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,674
I know you by heart.

90
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,609
My face hasn't changed, has it?

91
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,632
See? This is La Pointe Courte.

92
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,638
You've talked about it so often.

93
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,270
There's the house I was born in.

94
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,076
- That one?
- Yes.

95
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,748
There's the boatyard.

96
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,926
I've wanted to come back
for a long time.

97
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,726
Why didn't you come back sooner
without me?

98
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,990
With or without you...

99
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,729
It was the same to you.

100
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,505
I didn't say that...

101
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,600
but what I've found here is mine only.

102
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,675
Besides, you never wanted to come.

103
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,341
You always said
there was nothing to see.

104
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,575
It's true. Look!

105
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,089
I like to see things.

106
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,059
I don't.

107
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,201
You mean I forced you
to go on our trips.

108
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,334
I was happy to be with you.

109
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,473
I'm glad you're here.

110
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,712
But this isn't about us.

111
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,744
Life's a pleasure here.

112
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,552
You think so?

113
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,926
I don't.

114
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,962
Let's talk about it at once!

115
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,963
I came to tell you
we should separate.

116
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,203
That's what you figured out,
after 5 days alone?

117
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,178
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

118
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,841
So that was it.

119
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,483
We were to go on a trip,
we didn't go...

120
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,451
you were always delayed.

121
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,852
The vacation time went by...

122
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,153
and since I've no imagination...

123
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,992
I came here...
thinking you'd come a day or 2 later.

124
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,140
You arrive 5 days later...

125
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,874
and in this state!

126
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,742
You're tired.

127
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,310
You need rest...

128
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,514
and some sunshine.

129
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,000
It's very serious.
We must talk. That's why I came.

130
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,675
I'm sure it's very serious.

131
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,579
Where are you taking me?

132
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,526
To a house. A shack...

133
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,395
You can see it over there.

134
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,971
I'll say "Hello, Laurent!
This is my wife...

135
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,038
who's come for a rest...

136
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,775
and to get to know the area."

137
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,745
Your "homecoming" number is amusing.

138
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,446
Luckily I'm not from here.

139
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,651
We'd look like we were hired
by the tourist office!

140
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,647
Laurent!

141
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,457
Can we cross over?

142
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,752
- Swimming.
- By boat?

143
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,952
- Use the bridge!
- It's too far!

144
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,962
- Rowing is too hard!
- It's not that hot!

145
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,466
- I'm fixing the bike!
- Try a little harder!

146
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,498
OK, I'm coming!

147
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,234
Laurent, this is my wife.

148
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,336
Hello, ma'am.

149
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,804
Couldn't you use the bridge?

150
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,740
It wasn't there before.
I always used to cross this way.

151
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,007
Don't get used to bothering me
when I'm working.

152
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,209
I got the bike, some customers
and the hot sun.

153
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,853
The bike always needs work.

154
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,820
I'm busy! I got work to do!

155
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,933
You'll like this, Maxine. His wife!

156
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,034
She's from the north. Paris!

157
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,709
You'll be able to say bad things about us!

158
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,572
If they're just married,
they'll have time.

159
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,446
It's been 4 years.

160
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,444
I didn't know!

161
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,515
You don't look tired.

162
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,656
We're from good stock.

163
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,186
It's Maxine who's wrong.

164
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,950
Shut up!

165
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,742
Very nice!

166
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,718
It's brand new! Clean!

167
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,089
What a treat!

168
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,998
And there's water...

169
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,403
I mean, water when there's water.

170
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,408
It was connected this year at lssanca.

171
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,579
Then they cut it off.

172
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,975
I hope we'll have water next year.

173
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,079
See you later, folks.

174
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,918
How marvelous!

175
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,766
What a lovely room!

176
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,629
We'll go for walks.

177
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,697
What's the difference?

178
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,108
Is something wrong?

179
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,710
Do you know why?

180
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,751
I'm a bit scared...

181
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,056
for us.

182
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,157
We'll go slowly.
We'll be careful.

183
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,128
Never enough!

184
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,627
My delicate one!

185
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,760
My trampler!

186
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,969
Come on...

187
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,968
Let's have lunch.

188
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,580
Soldino, I came by earlier
and you weren't here.

189
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,483
I was having a nap.

190
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,657
Talk louder! I can't hear!

191
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,692
You're deaf? Since when?

192
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,366
I went deaf after the flu last winter!

193
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,230
At the movies I kept asking my wife...

194
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,371
"What's he saying?"

195
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,440
I could tell the lips moved
but that's all!

196
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,741
- Is your son here?
- Which one?

197
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,139
Louis!

198
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,542
He's in his shack.

199
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,409
Louis, tomorrow,
they're coming to get samples.

200
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,778
- At last!
- Who?

201
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,319
The advisory board.

202
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,485
He'll come with us in the boat
to see if the water's from the bottom.

203
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,622
You told 'em why?

204
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,994
They can't say no.
I didn't say a thing.

205
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,971
We'll take it to Béziers
to the Michel Laboratory.

206
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,775
We'll say it's for the Mauguio Lagoon...

207
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,672
to find out if it's the water
that rots our nets so fast.

208
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,982
The Board of Health can't stop us?

209
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,155
No, if we pay for the analysis...

210
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,321
we can take it anywhere we want.

211
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,558
You stir things up but...

212
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,358
we never get anything!

213
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,802
You don't stir up a thing
and it does no good!

214
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,098
The small lagoon should be allowed.

215
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,207
The shellfish are there.
The water's clean.

216
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,805
It's worth it!

217
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,713
We can still haul in the shellfish.

218
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,782
But we don't like working
like we were poisoning people.

219
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,820
You have your nets...

220
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,959
but we only get shellfish!

221
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,724
I'm going.

222
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,455
This morning we gave them a hard time!
Tonight we'll be OK.

223
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,032
Unless they call the coast patrol!

224
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,500
I'll send my girl to the bridge.

225
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,539
To keep an eye out.

226
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,545
What about the work?

227
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,890
What did she say?

228
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,424
She said "You can ask Papa
for my hand..."

229
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,892
"before you leave for the army..."

230
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,391
"but be careful! He's mean!"

231
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,899
I said "Do you want me to ask him?"

232
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,536
She said "I'm so tired!"

233
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,062
Tired of you?

234
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,742
I don't know if she's tired
of me or of him.

235
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,706
Ask and you'll find out.

236
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,743
I'm going to work.

237
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,932
Who's keeping watch?

238
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,605
Joseph's girl is over there.

239
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,935
What'll we do about these cats?
They're everywhere!

240
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,078
- What?
- That one's big again.

241
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,610
Like the Carmacci!

242
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,182
Again? Aren't 7 kids enough for her?

243
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,651
- She's always ready.
- Whose is it?

244
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,619
I don't know. Whoever wanted her!

245
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,325
It doesn't bother her.

246
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:31,799
If I was like her,
always ready to reproduce...

247
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,604
I'd sit at home with a sign...

248
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,714
on my belly: "Do Not Touch."

249
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,878
She doesn't mind.

250
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,955
Stay there!

251
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,381
It's the coastal patrol.
A man at the train station saw them.

252
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,716
What a life!

253
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:20,919
Hurry up!

254
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,107
This new motorboat!

255
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,939
A real thunderbolt!

256
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,377
Where were you fishing?

257
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,682
- Between Roucadou and Bouzigues.
- It's not sorted yet?

258
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,082
I didn't have time.
It's too far away.

259
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,450
Sorry, but that's not allowed.

260
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,789
You know it's not!

261
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,495
They're from over there! They're good!

262
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,257
You know it's forbidden
to sort them on shore.

263
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,455
Why?

264
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,761
It's not allowed!
You shouldn't have done it!

265
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,531
I'll have to report you.

266
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,335
Give me your name, age and address.

267
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,249
Scotto, Raphael...

268
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,510
20, registered by the navy...

269
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,251
La Pointe-Courte.

270
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,156
Why didn't he hurry?

271
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,727
He's asleep.

272
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,127
- He could've hidden.
- He's asleep, I tell you!

273
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,131
He's in love.

274
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,965
It's paid off big for him!
Who's the girl?

275
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,370
- Anna.
- He'll have a ball with her dad!

276
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,871
Done!

277
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,510
Ready to go!

278
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,081
The label...

279
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,082
Think a 6-franc Health label
is for nothing?

280
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,691
They know what we do with 'em.

281
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,858
If our shellfish were really bad...

282
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:15,328
there'd be plenty of corpses by now.

283
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,400
There's something else.
Why they bother us, poor guys...

284
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,596
with "healthy" and "unhealthy"...

285
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,731
All that hassle!

286
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,509
- Shall we begin?
- You in a hurry?

287
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,907
Yes.

288
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,048
You don't love me any more?

289
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,753
You want to leave me?

290
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,118
So what's it all about?

291
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,731
If you want to go on living in peace,
I can leave.

292
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,258
You only talk about happiness.

293
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,765
Yeah.

294
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:14,088
Being happy at all costs
has got us where we are.

295
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,385
Being happy without thinking!

296
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,562
Say what you're thinking.

297
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,434
Do we really love each other...

298
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,472
or do we live together out of habit?

299
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,112
What? The first one
who's had enough should leave...

300
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,144
if their heart says so.

301
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,910
The heart never tells us that.

302
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,150
The heart never gets enough.

303
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,524
It's the mind that rebels...

304
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,095
or the body.

305
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,200
When I met you,
there were no questions.

306
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,607
I went toward you.

307
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,403
One day I saw in the eyes of others
what we call "our love".

308
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,339
I saw it frolic about
while others coaxed it.

309
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,278
I saw it grow
while others envied it.

310
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,619
I began to look at it...

311
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,456
me too...

312
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,221
to watch it,
to look after it...

313
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,228
to weave crowns for it
and keep it under glass.

314
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,060
Too late!

315
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,503
It's stuffed. It's as dry
as an old orange blossom.

316
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:41,471
Our love.
That's all you say.

317
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,170
You look at it, under glass.

318
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,316
Do you love me or our love?

319
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,610
Look at me! Not at it!

320
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,554
I'm looking at you...

321
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,418
but not with the same eyes as before.

322
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,098
You looked at me with closed eyes then.

323
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,794
I saw no one but you.

324
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,800
Now you're comparing?

325
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,607
No, I'm not...

326
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,702
but I can see the others.

327
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,312
I imagine myself
living elsewhere, differently.

328
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,616
Would you like that?

329
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,286
I don't know
but I don't like these thoughts.

330
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,155
It's no big deal.

331
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,353
No, but it seems monstrous.

332
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,138
I never had such thoughts before.
And you?

333
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,713
I've always seen the others.

334
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:56,112
But I don't want to live
any other way than with you.

335
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,759
We chose one another.

336
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,367
Chose? As if we choose
what happens by accident.

337
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,243
We were chosen, elected, crowned!

338
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,344
If it's against nature,
nature gets its revenge.

339
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,050
And it is. It's separating us.

340
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,890
It's separating us?

341
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,186
You can't say we're in love
like at the beginning.

342
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,690
That's normal.

343
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,159
Normal!

344
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:45,068
Like growing old, seeing people
die in a war or at the hospital!

345
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,203
You think that's normal?

346
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,600
The two of us are madly in love.

347
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,208
We want nothing else.
We work. Time passes.

348
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,902
It rains or not.
We get a new cat, a new home...

349
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,172
new friends. We don't care.

350
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,275
But we change.
We're no longer madly in love.

351
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,481
Our love's like an old beau.

352
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,454
Never mind "our love."

353
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,701
I've loved you for just as long
and I'm not unhappy.

354
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,974
When I began to love you...

355
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:35,312
"with the wind in my sails"
as you used to say...I thought...

356
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,517
I'll make her happy.

357
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,953
I watched you live, talk,
laugh and make noise.

358
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,486
I knew I'd like your noise
above all others.

359
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,594
The more I'd know you,
the more I'd love you.

360
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,033
We're not in love like the first day.
So what?

361
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,128
I didn't choose love at any price.
I chose you...

362
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,174
to love you a lot,
then perhaps a bit less...

363
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,105
but to be with you.

364
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:08,311
- Tell me I don't know how to love.
- No, you love more than I do.

365
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,255
You devour, with closed eyes.

366
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,522
You have ideas. I don't.

367
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,520
I don't have any ideas.

368
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,325
I love differently.

369
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,962
You can't tell me
our love hasn't aged.

370
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,037
And one could cry about it all day.

371
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,547
You can't remain bitter all your life...

372
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,852
because we've aged together
during 4 years?

373
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,327
What else can we do?
We've tried everything.

374
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,193
You cheated on me.
I tried to cheat on you.

375
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,665
What was the point?

376
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,275
Since then, I love you even more.

377
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,037
I realize what we have together.

378
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,046
Bravo!

379
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,674
I realize what we no longer have...

380
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,716
and how heavy an affair is.

381
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:20,713
- If you were lighter...
- I'd be the happiest of women!

382
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,325
Instead, you're the most unhappy.
I'm fed up!

383
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,030
I'm kindness itself.

384
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,597
Except for work, I think
only of your happiness.

385
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,093
I'm patient and caring
and you're unhappy.

386
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,498
And why? For nothing!

387
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,714
Instead of a haven for each other...

388
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,715
it's a constant revolt.

389
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,756
You'd rather give me up
and see me leave...

390
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,120
anything rather than give up
your quiet little life.

391
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,259
Well, I'll let you work and...

392
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,398
Iive in peace
but I won't sit in a corner!

393
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,572
I'll live without you too!

394
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,832
Why wait?

395
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,969
We work better alone,
don't feel the time slip by.

396
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,739
Perfect! Honesty at last!

397
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:21,782
Keep talking, sweetheart!
I want to hear my fate.

398
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,317
I'm not judging you,
just saying what I think.

399
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,581
Don't you do the same?

400
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,954
Yes. And I judge us.

401
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,959
Guilty!

402
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,597
I judge you.
You're either blind or a coward.

403
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,167
You didn't dare break our little habits?
Break them!

404
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,630
You'll be at ease again.

405
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,773
Me, I've decided to live alone.

406
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,408
Don't be heroic!

407
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,438
Keep your room.
The apartment's big enough.

408
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,911
I'll find my spot there
when I get back.

409
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,409
That's how you react.

410
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,343
Calmly.

411
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,416
You'd let me leave.

412
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,816
Yes, if you don't want to stay.

413
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,218
If we separate,
nothing else will interest me.

414
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,463
You had ambitions for "our love."

415
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,390
It's your pride talking,
not your grief.

416
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,500
But I do have grief.

417
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,472
So do l.

418
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,672
Not as much as I do.

419
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,538
There's so little difference.

420
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,387
I said not to yell!

421
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,663
Daniel has a fever.

422
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,891
These kids get on my nerves!

423
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,770
- He threw up?
- Yes.

424
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,135
- Several times?
- Since yesterday.

425
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,995
Why didn't you call me sooner?

426
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,293
Because he's never been sick.

427
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,339
I didn't know!

428
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,100
Little Daniel!

429
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,041
What misfortune!

430
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,581
Have you seen Raphael?

431
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,389
Call him. The train's at 7:00.

432
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,499
- Come on, Raphael!
- Me?

433
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,801
Why do you want him?

434
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,770
We've come to take him to jail.

435
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,185
They want you in Montpellier today.

436
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,857
For how long?

437
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,052
5 days. It'll soon be over.

438
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,560
So you say!

439
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,325
Let's go, if you want
to stop at your place.

440
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,342
Poor kid! Try not to let
my husband see you!

441
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:38,846
Poor Anna!

442
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,657
He knows, but seeing me
between you two...

443
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,417
he'll give his daughter hell.

444
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,720
We'll let you cross...

445
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,755
the neighborhood alone.

446
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,960
Go change and...

447
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,362
meet us at the 7:00 train...

448
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,038
in the last car.

449
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,607
- You'll be responsible?
- Yes, I've known him for years.

450
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,970
It really hurts me.
This isn't our concern.

451
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,341
Go on and don't get us in trouble!

452
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,523
Dad, I've got a problem.

453
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,157
I took 62 lbs. of cockles
to the fishmonger...

454
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,297
and he gave me credit for 56 lbs.

455
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,863
If he made you lose 6 lbs...

456
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,234
he's stealing your weariness.

457
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,596
Those fishmongers!

458
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,742
Makes me puke!

459
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,905
Go back out.

460
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,442
Béziers sent me a report
on the samples.

461
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,415
It says there's bacteria.

462
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:46,919
Impossible!

463
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,589
I'll show you the report.

464
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,191
They're in cahoots with Montpellier.

465
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,867
You can still prepare a petition.

466
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,460
6:00!

467
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,099
I have to pick up Rosette at 6:45.

468
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:10,103
I don't have time
to get into the work but...

469
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,210
20 francs is 20 francs,
a half-hour's a half-hour!

470
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,748
Better to go there than to jail!

471
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,110
- I'll teach you!
- I did nothing wrong!

472
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,775
- You're too young to date!
- Mama got married at 19!

473
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,194
What's wrong?

474
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,263
He got slapped
because Daniel is dead.

475
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,759
Come with me!

476
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,373
I'll buy you some licorice.

477
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:29,889
Once she's a legal adult,
she can marry who she wants!

478
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,891
Jules, you can do as you wish.
You're the father.

479
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:37,123
But I gave you my daughter
when she was 19!

480
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,535
Mme Repeto had to help!

481
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,195
Mme Repeto!

482
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,240
She forgets everything...

483
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:47,342
but she remembers that.

484
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,134
You got her, didn't you?

485
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,946
Is this a family meeting?

486
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,451
About Anna again?

487
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,412
Do as you wish.
She's your daughter.

488
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,723
But she's mine too.

489
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,592
I don't want her
to go through what I did.

490
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,659
Sorry, Papa, but you were tough.

491
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,490
You tried to hang on to us forever.

492
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,599
Now it's up to her.

493
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,462
I don't say she'll get married.
She's 16.

494
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,434
But if it's serious,
let her date!

495
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,873
Then they may get married.

496
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,480
They're old enough to begin.

497
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,510
We're already shit out
half our crap.

498
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,445
And if the bastard
wants to take advantage of her?

499
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,022
He's no bastard. He's too dumb.

500
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,352
He let himself get caught!

501
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:41,463
Now he worries about you in jail.
You'll spoil his stay!

502
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,463
As long as Anna's under my roof...

503
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,828
no one'll take advantage of her!

504
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:02,716
Here you're as happy
as if the world were yours.

505
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:08,290
With a woman I'd find
standing next to me.

506
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,016
What an encounter!

507
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,798
Don't talk about an encounter!

508
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:19,160
The time when we didn't know
one another is long gone.

509
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,136
I know your tastes,
quirks and manners.

510
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,671
Your habits have become my own.

511
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,347
There are no more surprises.

512
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,113
I could live in your stead.

513
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,146
Yes, having my quirks and manners...

514
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,818
but that's not living.

515
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,726
Knowledge is something else.

516
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,621
You'd never come here...

517
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,325
and yet this is half of my life.

518
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,631
You've no need to think of me.

519
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,169
Think of nothing. Look around!

520
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,598
As if you'd been here for years...

521
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,476
Iike a shepherd guarding...

522
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:05,840
the secrets of the landscape
better than his animals.

523
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,175
And this one!

524
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,384
- Is he watching the fish?
- He's waiting for them.

525
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,851
He's looking after them.

526
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,355
Go ahead!

527
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,752
Take it easy!

528
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,861
Did you spot some mullet?

529
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,693
Yes, some mullet.
We're gonna make 'em jump!

530
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,477
In Paris it seemed normal
to have you as a partner.

531
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,854
Here, I can feel the strangeness
of our connection.

532
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:07,667
I wonder why I'm here in this spot
where you chose to be born.

533
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:09,930
Chose?

534
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,392
I came here to leave you but...

535
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,562
there are better things to do.

536
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,700
I came to make noise
and silence has won out.

537
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,461
What rest!

538
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,162
It's our first vacation.

539
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,692
True. The other years we traveled...

540
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,129
always to places unknown to both of us.

541
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,567
Here, you've already had dreams.
Perhaps with others? With whom?

542
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,769
You know all about my youth.

543
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,773
Don't walk backwards, my little crab.

544
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,538
Were you happy?

545
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,083
Let's not discuss that.

546
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:34,282
I gave you everything
to be shared, not torn apart.

547
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,356
I've nibbled enough on your memories.

548
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,357
You wretched thing!

549
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,769
Look!

550
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,674
For travel, my only ambition is...

551
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,878
to see something like this
from time to time.

552
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:50,358
Ambition? Do you know that word?

553
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:55,056
I spent my childhood
in these boatyards.

554
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,332
A shipbuilder builds boats.

555
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,801
He repairs them. That's all.

556
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,000
My dad never thought of expanding.

557
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:08,900
He died young...

558
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:12,377
but he'd have aged the same way,
calmly working.

559
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,852
In Paris, so many people want to succeed
and make a place for themselves.

560
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,713
I was born there and...

561
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,893
saw lots of excitement around me.

562
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,629
For a long time I thought
it was useful.

563
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,065
You taught me to keep still.

564
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,379
I love this ship!

565
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,939
It's our home's attic.

566
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,645
It must have rats!

567
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,594
If you've learned to keep still,
don't get so excited!

568
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,367
You'll fall. Be careful!

569
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,770
Here you don't like being tired.

570
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,807
You'll hate it too.

571
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,447
Here, when they say
"He's very tired," it means...

572
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,513
"He's about to die."

573
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,123
Everything would've been easier for us...

574
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,023
if I'd been born next door to you.

575
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,258
Too much!

576
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,923
I wouldn't have loved you...

577
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,396
if you were like me.

578
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:45,433
The resemblance
must come little by little.

579
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,680
On the red boat...

580
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,889
Scotto Raphael
from the "Sporting Lance"!

581
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,623
- Are you OK?
- Fine!

582
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,862
- Having fun?
- Yes.

583
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,762
You haven't said a word.

584
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,068
I'm happy.

585
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,338
I said: "Alexandre,
if you don't want to joust, stay home!"

586
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:27,709
On the blue boat, Soldino Albert
from the "Sporting Lance"!

587
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,346
On the red boat...

588
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,386
Calcazani Auguste
from the "Golden Shield!"

589
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,402
Be quiet!

590
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,037
I am! I am!

591
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,037
Albert Soldino has qualified
for a return match!

592
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,108
And now a word from the band!

593
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,613
Sir! An ice cream!

594
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,838
Warning to the jouster Sébastien!

595
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,814
Get in on the blue boat!

596
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,661
Each Sunday in summer is like this...

597
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,163
...minus the tribune and the officials.

598
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,673
Is there a crowd every Sunday?

599
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,271
Yes, from 2 till 7.

600
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,444
Can you watch for that long?

601
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,571
- It's always the same, isn't it?
- Maybe.

602
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,743
But if you knew
the jousters as I do..

603
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,287
their passes and little tricks!

604
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,190
Even if you don't understand the game...

605
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,691
it's a sight I've always known...

606
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,920
and it enchants me.

607
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,589
Albert, are you afraid of the water?

608
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,955
Want a flag like your jousting uncle?

609
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,324
They gave La Pointe a fine tournament!

610
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,330
Yes, but like always...

611
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:09,834
they put La Pointe over there
and the tribune in the shade.

612
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,610
You know the officials
don't like to come here.

613
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,574
After what they pulled on us...

614
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,247
they feel uneasy
for refusing our petition.

615
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,616
I told you they'll never give in.

616
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,153
Samples, analyses...
It's not worth it.

617
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:30,348
We'll never get the small lagoon.

618
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,824
If we keep trying, maybe...

619
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,327
They want us to leave!

620
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,329
They want us at the big lagoon
and if we won't move...

621
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,798
So we'll keep after 'em!

622
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:45,000
Each year we'll take samples
till one of the officials says...

623
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,801
"Why keep giving them a hard time?"

624
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,669
"Let 'em fish!
There's so little bacteria!"

625
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,940
- There's no Health guy like that!
- Who knows?

626
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,610
Admit that it's cheerful here.

627
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,821
No longer sorry you came?

628
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,546
I didn't know...

629
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,156
But I often told you all about it!

630
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:08,557
You listened to me like I was
telling stories, not my story!

631
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,323
It was "our love,"
not me that you loved.

632
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,196
Now I'll love you...

633
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,634
native of La Pointe-Courte,
son of a boat carpenter...

634
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,306
fan of jousting and the sun!

635
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,843
You won't blame me
or ask me for anything...

636
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,912
without thinking of all this.

637
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:32,717
You'll love me very thoughtfully.

638
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,687
Why not? Do you love me madly?

639
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,286
I don't think so.

640
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,237
Here's Raphael!

641
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,876
- How are you, my boy?
- Fine.

642
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,003
Nice day. You'll be at the dance tonight?

643
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,613
What about it, Anna?

644
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,407
Thank you.

645
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:07,415
Now you talk to him
and let him dance with Anna!

646
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:08,988
You're a good man.

647
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:13,851
He jousted well.
He'll be a real man!

648
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,231
Each time he came,
I tried to nail him first!

649
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,368
There was nothing to be done!

650
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,697
On the next pass, he came back.
I tried again!

651
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,101
Bang! He unhooked me!

652
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,139
Weren't you in jail?

653
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:29,572
He escaped!

654
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,770
I asked for a leave.

655
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:35,041
I proved I was on the jousting list
and here I am!

656
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,378
You're lucky!

657
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,456
I'm going back tomorrow
to do 2 more days.

658
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,926
- They'll leave tonight.
- They're odd.

659
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,602
Some vacation!
Always trotting around like dogs!

660
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,666
They talk too much to be happy.

661
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,143
Is something wrong?

662
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,073
Lie down a bit.

663
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,282
Maybe you were too hot
this afternoon.

664
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,286
At least I had some ice cream.

665
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,991
Your ice cream!

666
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,624
I won't forget it.

667
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,698
You know...

668
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,300
I thought you'd gone...

669
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,000
Iike you said the first day.

670
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,865
You thought that?

671
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,373
- I'd never go like that.
- How do I know?

672
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,874
- You know me completely.
- Yes.

673
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,881
But your mind changes all the time.

674
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,214
I'm always a day or 2 behind.

675
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,683
I'll keep you up to date.

676
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,748
Made your decision?

677
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,888
Nothing's decided...

678
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,425
but I've faced the facts.

679
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,500
The bonds between us
are stronger than we are.

680
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,939
We've lost the youth of our love.

681
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,875
The emotion, discovery, desire...

682
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,941
the passion.

683
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,011
And I can't get over it.

684
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,352
But adult love based on knowledge
is a passion...

685
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,224
Iess external, not so fragile...

686
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,266
rather like maternal love
that nothing can truly hurt.

687
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,699
Are you sure all of this is about me?

688
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,374
Yes, you!

689
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,287
Now I know how I love you...

690
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,255
and no one will ever free me.

691
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,230
Free you? I never tied you down.

692
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:40,562
True. And we may not always
live together.

693
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,703
If you love me as you say...

694
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,531
I'll never let you go again.

695
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,009
Together or apart,
nothing will ever undo us.

696
01:10:52,147 --> 01:10:55,173
You love me calmly,
the way you live calmly.

697
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:58,982
Yet you're trapped
just as I am.

698
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:01,280
I don't feel trapped.

699
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,348
You will.

700
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,567
You think you stole my soul.

701
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,464
Yes, and you stole mine.

702
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,970
If you wish, but what does that change?

703
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:20,471
Nothing.

704
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:22,540
But...

705
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:26,470
it's good to know
what we've traded our youth for.

706
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,209
Do you think it's worth the exchange?

707
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,481
I don't know.

708
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,489
Is it canal water on the ceiling?

709
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,357
Yes, because the moon's in the canal.

710
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,850
Gentlemen, a little silence, please!

711
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,085
And now for something different!

712
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:24,129
M. de Ruby is going to sing us a song!

713
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,937
M. de Ruby!

714
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,473
I'll sing "l Love Only You."

715
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,942
I love only you

716
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:46,814
Since my lips have met
The fever of your kiss

717
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:52,186
I love only you
And my heart rises...

718
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:03,202
My voice despite me
Implores you night and day

719
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:09,275
Because I fear
You won't be back

720
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:13,778
But when I see you
It all sings with me

721
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:23,289
I love only you
Only you!

722
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,031
This is long! I'd better step in!

723
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:37,899
Well?

724
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:42,134
Have you finished eating?
The dance is starting! Are you coming?

725
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,208
We've got time!

726
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:49,747
They threw the fine in the sea.

727
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:01,819
Quiet! Quiet!

728
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:09,426
I'm proud to give Albert Soldino
the Grand Jousting Trophy!

729
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,897
Let's hear it for Albert!

730
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,618
Look at him, Papa,
after all his complaining...

731
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:19,496
he still has fun
like a youngster!

732
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:26,265
Parties don't change a thing,
but they make us feel good.

733
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:42,016
Time for bed, kids!

734
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:51,759
You were right to be so calm
the day I arrived.

735
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,333
In a few days, you'll start again.

736
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:58,164
You'll do your "This can't go on!"
number for me again.

737
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,241
Maybe.

738
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,874
But now I know it's pointless.

739
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,012
You feel resigned?

740
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,313
Resigned, reassured...

741
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,017
delighted.

742
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,619
The secrets we're bringing home!

743
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,296
A couple's secrets
bring them closer.

744
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:26,661
But no one knows
if the secrets are happy or sad.

745
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,148
Come on, kids!

746
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:52,292
Auntie, I lost my hanky!

747
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,293
- Louisette!
- Coming!

748
01:18:56,531 --> 01:19:00,695
When you bring back the basket,
don't forget the towel!

749
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,197
Mine has a loop in the corner.

750
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,611
Cast off!

751
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:18,176
Uncle Noel, don't drown
all the kittens in the canal!

752
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,448
Save me one!

753
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,859
The little black and white one
with the white belly!

754
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,358
The kid annoys me with his kitten!

755
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,766
Isn't Pomponette enough for you?

756
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,628
We'll have to look after his kitten!

757
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,598
Don't drown it!

758
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,105
Bye, sonny!

759
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,341
Goodbye, Noel!

760
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,379
Goodbye, Noel!
Remember the towel!

761
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,395
Be careful of your feet!

762
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,724
He's no trouble, ma'am! Never mind!

763
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,195
I'm thirsty!

764
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,193
Some coffee, ma'am?

765
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,598
For him, sir?
I don't think so!

766
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,570
If his mom doesn't touch it
he doesn't need any.

767
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,902
When do we get to Paris?

768
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,910
Tomorrow morning.
