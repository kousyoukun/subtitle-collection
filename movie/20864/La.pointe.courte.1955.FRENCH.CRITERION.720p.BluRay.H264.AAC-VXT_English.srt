1
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,183
Hello.

2
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,242
There's a guy outside.

3
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,869
- Who?
- I don't know.

4
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,988
Still there?

5
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,150
Must be an inspector.
No one knows him.

6
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,776
Better tell your dad.

7
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,904
Déde, go tell grampa.

8
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,831
No, tell uncle Jules first.

9
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,867
Take your grapes.

10
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,840
There's a guy by the fig tree.

11
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,721
- So?
- Dad doesn't know him.

12
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,641
An inspector, I bet.

13
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,564
Anna, go warn grampa.

14
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:12,611
Grampa, you got anything in the yard?
There's a stranger hanging around.

15
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:18,368
They must've seen me
at faugat this morning.

16
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,538
I didn't see them.
I'll fish where I want!

17
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,339
What's that guy doing?
I don't know.

18
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,529
I'm not sure if it's this shack.

19
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,618
I wait an hour in this heat,
and you're not sure?

20
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,532
This must be it.

21
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,044
What are you doing,
barging in on people?

22
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,795
You know who I am?

23
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,415
I don't care.

24
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,337
Board of health.

25
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,014
Put that away and clear out.
You should've shown it sooner.

26
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,929
You know I have
the right to search.

27
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,561
You should've shown your ID
and a search warrant first.

28
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,640
- I have one.
- It's too goddamn late.

29
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,314
I caught you breaking
in here like thieves.

30
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,859
You could be out
to steal something.

31
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,653
I'm gonna kick your asses
out of here.

32
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,698
- He's calling us thieves now?
- What's your name?

33
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,742
I'm not telling you!
This is tyranny!

34
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,536
This is my place.

35
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,793
Mrs. soldino?
Board of health. May we come in?

36
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,125
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

37
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,974
Did your husband
go fishing this morning?

38
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,814
When he got up this morning,

39
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,518
his hand hurt,
and when he wanted to -

40
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,732
wanted to what?

41
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,067
He wanted to -

42
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,906
Can't you see she's senile?
She's my mother-in-law.

43
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,827
You're upsetting everyone!

44
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,752
Go on, get lost!

45
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,836
We're eating quietly,
and they show up like gangsters.

46
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,426
- You're coming to the station.
- Fine.

47
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,342
I'll file a complaint
for illegal entry.

48
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,181
- No one will believe you.
- They sure will.

49
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,686
I'll give you as much trouble
as you've given us.

50
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,900
Hassling us for what?
They don't even know.

51
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,823
- You'll pay for this.
- I doubt it.

52
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,617
- Come on, Jules.
- I'm coming.

53
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,950
Soon as they leave us alone.

54
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,793
Rummaging around
in people's shacks - for what?

55
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,920
You make me laugh.

56
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,672
You'll see!

57
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,382
You messed up.

58
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,841
I went through the hole
and got the basket from the shack.

59
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,843
It's under the bed.

60
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,681
I'm coming.

61
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,426
Here, kitty...

62
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,474
So they came to harass your dad?

63
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,107
Yeah, but they got
an earful from Jules instead!

64
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,122
The mistral has kicked up again.

65
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,681
I heard you were here.

66
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,513
How are you, Louis?

67
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,601
You here for a while?

68
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,979
- Yes.
- How long?

69
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,390
A little while.

70
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,188
So long.

71
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,080
This was some time ago,
not yesterday.

72
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,824
You're really something.

73
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,248
At 20, I could jump in the water
and jump out dry.

74
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,042
Listen to this guy!

75
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,010
Well, I'm off to the station.

76
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,471
He met the Paris train
yesterday too.

77
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,636
- Who's he expecting?
- His wife.

78
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,806
- And he doesn't know when?
- He said no.

79
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,330
- So how are you?
- How'd you know I was coming today?

80
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,121
- I've come every morning.
- For the past five days?

81
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,878
You're sweet.

82
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,304
He didn't seem like a skirt-chaser,
but he sure found a pretty girl.

83
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,926
There are lots like her in Paris.

84
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,766
Did they recognize you?

85
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,269
They'd forgotten me a bit in 12 years,
but once they saw me -

86
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,808
do you recognize me?

87
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,645
I know you by heart.

88
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,647
My face hasn't changed?

89
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,593
See? This is la pointe courte.

90
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,592
You've talked about it so often.

91
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,420
There's the house I was born in.

92
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,210
- That one?
- Yes.

93
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,630
There's the boatyard.

94
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,396
I've wanted to come
back here for so long.

95
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,023
Why didn't you come back
sooner without me?

96
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,017
With or without you...

97
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,772
It was all the same to you.

98
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,570
I didn't say that.

99
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,820
But what I've rediscovered here
belongs to me alone.

100
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,107
Besides,
you never wanted to come.

101
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,826
You always said
there was nothing to see.

102
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,946
It's true. Look.

103
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,464
I like to see things.

104
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,341
I don't so much.

105
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,304
Meaning I forced you
to go on all those trips?

106
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,350
No, I was happy
just being with you.

107
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:24,727
And I'm glad you're here...

108
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,684
But this isn't about us.

109
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,938
Just living is a pleasure here.

110
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,484
You think so?

111
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,991
I don't.

112
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,752
Let's get things
right out on the table.

113
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,196
I came to tell you
it's time we separated.

114
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,500
That's what you figured out,
after five days alone?

115
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,296
It's been on my mind
much longer than that.

116
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,882
So that was it.

117
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,881
We were to go on a trip.

118
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,717
We never went.

119
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,591
Something always held you up.

120
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,886
The vacation time went by,

121
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,350
and since I have little imagination,

122
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,269
I came here thinking
you'd follow a day or two later.

123
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,367
Then you show up five days later...

124
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,071
All worked up like this.

125
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,747
You're tired.

126
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,288
You need rest...

127
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,669
And sunshine.

128
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,142
This is very serious.
I came so we could talk it over.

129
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,769
Oh, I'm sure it's very serious.

130
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,659
Where are you taking me?

131
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,464
To a house. Well, a shack.

132
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,675
You can see it over there.

133
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,094
I'll say, “hello, Laurent.

134
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,093
This is my wife,
who's come for a rest...

135
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,850
And to get to know the area.”

136
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,853
Your “homecoming” number
is amusing.

137
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,530
Good thing I'm not from here.

138
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,155
We'd look like we were hired
by the tourism office.

139
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,434
Laurent!

140
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,518
Can we cross over?

141
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,154
- If you swim!
- I mean in your boat!

142
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,193
- Use the bridge.
- It's too far.

143
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,360
- Rowing's too much work!
- It's not that hot yet.

144
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,704
- I'm fixing my bike.
- Come on, help us out!

145
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,535
Okay, I'm coming.

146
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,440
Laurent, this is my wife.

147
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,358
Hello, ma'am.

148
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,697
Couldn't you use the bridge?

149
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,914
There was no bridge before.
I always crossed over this way.

150
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,121
Well, don't get in the habit
of interrupting my work.

151
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,496
There's my bike, my customers,
and the hot sun.

152
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,839
The bike always needs work.

153
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,797
I'm busy. I have work to do.

154
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,095
You'll enjoy this, Maxime.
His wife.

155
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,309
Hear that?
She's from up north. Paris.

156
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,027
You can bad-mouth
us southerners to her.

157
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,863
If they're newlyweds,
she'll learn to appreciate it here.

158
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,277
- We've been married four years.
- I didn't know that.

159
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,454
He hasn't worn you down.

160
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,457
We're from good stock.

161
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,122
So Maxime was wrong after all.

162
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,120
Be quiet!

163
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,399
Very nice!

164
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,983
See? All clean and brand-new.

165
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,164
What a pleasure!

166
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,920
And there's water.

167
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,295
I mean... when there's water.

168
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,337
They hooked it up
this year at issanka.

169
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,506
Then they cut it off.

170
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,016
We hope we'll have water next year.

171
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,227
See you later, folks.

172
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,277
How marvelous!

173
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,117
What a lovely room.

174
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,949
We'll go for walks.

175
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,829
Oh, what difference would it make?

176
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,253
Is something wrong?

177
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,716
You know why?

178
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,848
I'm a little scared...

179
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,218
For us.

180
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:21,355
We'll take it slow
and be very careful.

181
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,225
Never careful enough.

182
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,731
My delicate one!

183
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,901
My big ox.

184
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,076
Come on.

185
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,070
Let's have lunch.

186
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,672
Soldino, I came by earlier.
You weren't here.

187
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,582
I was napping.

188
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,753
Talk louder. I can't hear.

189
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,805
Are you deaf? Since when?

190
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,265
I went deaf
after the flu last winter.

191
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,559
At the movies the other day
I kept asking my wife...

192
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,603
“What's he saying?”

193
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,648
I could see their jowls moving.
That was all.

194
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,817
Is your son here? - Which one?

195
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,231
Louis.

196
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,491
He's in his shack.

197
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,481
Louis, they're coming
tomorrow to take samples.

198
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,737
- Finally.
- Who?

199
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,857
The labor representative.

200
00:24:55,995 --> 00:25:00,830
He's coming along to see
if we're taking water from the bottom.

201
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,831
You told 'em why?

202
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,168
They can't say no.
I didn't say a thing.

203
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:11,257
We'll take it to
the Michel laboratory in béziers.

204
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,004
We'll say
it's for the mauguio lagoon...

205
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,927
To see if it's the water
that's rotting our nets so fast.

206
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,262
The board of health can't stop us?

207
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,898
No.

208
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,520
If we pay for the test,
we can take it where we want.

209
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,564
You stir things up...

210
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,567
But nothing will ever come of it.

211
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,037
And you don't stir up a thing.
That's no better.

212
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,081
The small lagoon
should be allowed.

213
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,919
There are shellfish there.
The water's clean.

214
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,872
And that counts for something.

215
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,841
We can still haul in shellfish.

216
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:00,715
Sure, but we don't like working
like we're poisoning people.

217
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,134
You still have your nets,

218
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,886
but we only get shellfish.

219
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,563
I'm off.

220
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,519
They got a mouthful this morning.
They'll leave us alone tonight.

221
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,020
Unless they send
the fishing patrol.

222
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,656
I'll send my little girl
to the bridge

223
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,696
to keep an eye out.

224
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,948
How's that work coming along?

225
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,792
What did she say?

226
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,329
“You can ask dad for my hand

227
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,301
but watch out. He's a mean one.”

228
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,803
I asked,
“you want to get married?”

229
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,639
She said, “oh, I'm tired.”

230
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,598
- Tired of you?
- Me... or her father. Who knows?

231
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,642
Ask and you'll find out.

232
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,647
I'm going to work.

233
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,200
Anyone keeping watch?

234
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,116
Joseph's little girl is over there.

235
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,791
What'll we do with these cats?
They're everywhere.

236
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:39,043
- What?
- That one's big again.

237
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,667
Like the carmacci woman.

238
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,387
Again?
Aren't seven enough for her?

239
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,674
- She's always ready.
- Whose is it?

240
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,722
I don't know.
Whoever wanted her.

241
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,236
It doesn't bother her.

242
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,202
If I was like her,
always ready to reproduce...

243
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,949
I'd sit at home with a sign
on my belly saying...

244
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,951
“Don't touch”!

245
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,999
She doesn't mind.

246
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,665
Stay there.

247
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,617
Here's the fishing patrol now.

248
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,111
The station attendant saw them.

249
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,746
What a life!

250
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,959
Hurry!

251
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,142
Their new motorboat!

252
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,148
A real lightning bolt.

253
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,670
Where were you fishing?

254
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,800
- Between roucaidous and bouzigues.
- That's not sorted yet?

255
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,386
I didn't have time.
I had to get back.

256
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,892
Sorry, but that's not allowed.

257
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,848
You know that.

258
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,597
I told you where it's from.
It's good.

259
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,392
You know it's forbidden
to sort it on shore.

260
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,776
Why?

261
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,113
It's just not allowed.
You shouldn't have done it.

262
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,617
I have to report you.

263
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,412
Give me your name,
age, and address.

264
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,369
Scotto, raphaél...

265
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,585
Age 20, ex-Navy man...

266
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,963
La pointe courte.

267
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,170
Why didn't he hurry?

268
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,797
He's asleep.

269
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:19,434
- He could've hidden.
- He's asleep, I tell you.

270
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,222
He's in love.

271
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,062
Lot of good it's done him!
Who's the girl?

272
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,478
- Anna.
- He'll have a ball with her dad.

273
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,734
All done.

274
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,607
Ready to go.

275
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,109
The label.

276
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,122
Think a six-franc health label
is for nothing?

277
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,703
They know what we do with 'em.

278
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,755
If our shellfish were really bad,

279
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,342
there'd be plenty
of corpses by now.

280
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,302
And something else.

281
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,805
Why do they bother us poor guys

282
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,925
with all this about “sanitary”
and “unsanitary”?

283
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,806
All that hassle.

284
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,515
- Shall we start?
- You're in a hurry.

285
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,145
Yes, I am.

286
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,399
So you don't love me anymore?

287
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,983
So you want to leave me?

288
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,325
Then what's all this about?

289
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,124
If you want your quiet life here,
I can leave.

290
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,912
Happiness is all you talk about.
That's right.

291
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:51,018
Being happy at all costs
has got us where we are.

292
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,563
- You mean being happy without thinking.
- No!

293
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,869
Fine. Say what you're thinking.

294
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,535
Do we really love each other...

295
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,619
Or do we live together out of habit?

296
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,255
What? Whoever's first
to have enough should leave

297
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,507
if their heart tells them to.

298
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:21,007
It's not the heart that tells us that.

299
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,261
The heart never gets enough.

300
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,644
It's the mind that rebels...

301
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,143
Or the body.

302
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,407
When I met you,
there were no questions.

303
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,742
I went toward you.

304
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,073
One day I saw in the eyes of others
what we call “our love.”

305
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:49,581
I saw it frolic about
while the others coaxed it.

306
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,622
I saw it grow
while others grew jealous of it.

307
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,625
I began to look at it.

308
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:03,473
I too took to keeping watch over it,
looking after it...

309
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,393
Weaving garlands for it,
keeping it under glass.

310
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,263
Too late.

311
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,689
It's stuffed now,
dry as an old orange blossom.

312
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,940
“Our love.”

313
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,734
That's all you say.

314
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,199
You watch over it, keep it under glass.

315
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,410
Do you love me... or our love?

316
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,696
Look at me, not at it!

317
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,616
I'm looking at you...

318
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,868
But not with the same eyes
as before.

319
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,463
You looked at me
with closed eyes then.

320
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,132
Yes, but I saw no one but you.

321
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,052
Whereas now you're comparing.

322
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,766
No, I'm not...

323
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,103
But I can see the others.

324
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,474
I imagine myself living
elsewhere, differently.

325
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,898
Would you like that?

326
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,651
I don't know, but I don't like
having these thoughts.

327
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,404
It's no big deal.

328
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,828
No big deal?
I think it's dreadful.

329
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,846
I never used to have such thoughts.
Did you?

330
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,841
I've always noticed the others.

331
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:33,730
But I don't want to live anywhere
but with you.

332
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,946
We chose each other.

333
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,290
Chose?

334
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,005
As if we choose
what happens by accident.

335
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,713
Fine. We chose, selected,
crowned each other.

336
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,838
But if it's against nature,
nature will have its revenge.

337
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,183
And it is. It's separating us.

338
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,181
Nature is?

339
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,521
You can't say we're in love
like in the beginning.

340
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,015
That's normal.

341
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,733
Normal?

342
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:22,901
Like growing old, or seeing people
die at war or in a hospital -

343
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,905
you call that normal?

344
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,819
Two people love each other madly.
They want nothing else.

345
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,412
They work. Time passes.
It rains or it's sunny.

346
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,120
They get a new cat,
a new home, new friends.

347
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,492
They don't care.

348
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,671
But we've changed too.
We're no longer madly in love.

349
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,840
Our love's like an old Beau.

350
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,553
Forget about “our love.”

351
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,483
I've loved you just as long,
and I'm not unhappy.

352
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,066
When I began to love you

353
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:12,412
“with the wind in my sails”
as you call it, I thought...

354
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,824
“I'll make her happy.”

355
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,293
I watched you live, talk,
laugh, make noise.

356
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,835
I knew I'd prefer your noise
above all others',

357
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,297
and that the more I knew you,
the more I'd love you.

358
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,671
Of course we're not in love
like at first. So what?

359
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,346
I didn't choose love at any price.
I chose you...

360
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,513
To love you a lot,
then perhaps a bit less...

361
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,477
But to be with you.

362
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,977
- Just say it: I don't know how to love.
- No.

363
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,149
You love more than I do.

364
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,492
You devour with your eyes closed.

365
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,745
You have ideas. I don't.

366
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,659
I have no ideas.
I love in a different way.

367
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,166
You can't tell me
our love hasn't aged.

368
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,212
And it's sad enough
to spend all day in tears.

369
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,392
You can't be bitter all your life

370
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,238
because we've aged together
these last four years.

371
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,441
What else can we do?
We've tried everything.

372
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:36,033
You cheated on me.
I tried to cheat on you.

373
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,701
Where did that get us?

374
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,578
You know I love you
even more now.

375
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,130
I realized clearly
all we had together.

376
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,045
Bravo.

377
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,552
I realize what we no longer have

378
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,797
and how heavy an affair is.

379
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,888
- If you lightened up a bit -
- I'd be the happiest of women.

380
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,098
Instead, you're the unhappiest.

381
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,892
I'm fed up.

382
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,931
I'm kindness itself.

383
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,730
Except for work,
I think only of your happiness.

384
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,188
I'm patient and caring,
and you're unhappy.

385
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,611
Why? For no reason.

386
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,123
Instead of being a haven
for each other...

387
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,830
It's a constant revolt.

388
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,719
See? You'd rather give me up
and see me leave.

389
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,340
Anything but give up
your quiet little life.

390
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:41,936
Fine. Keep your work
and your tranquil life.

391
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,768
But I won't sit quietly in a corner!

392
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,901
I'll live without you too!
Why wait?

393
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,155
One works better alone,
never sensing time slipping by.

394
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,858
Perfect! Honesty at last!

395
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,870
Keep talking, sweetheart.
I want to hear my fate.

396
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,573
I'm not judging you,
just saying what I think.

397
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,825
Don't you do the same?

398
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:07,079
Yes, but I judge us too.

399
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,205
Guilty.

400
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:12,675
I judge you.
You're either blind or a coward.

401
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,429
You didn't dare break our little habits?
Break them.

402
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,639
You'll be at ease again.

403
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,846
I've decided to live alone.

404
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,477
No heroics, please!

405
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,647
Keep your room.
The apartment's big enough.

406
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,150
I'll find my spot when I return.

407
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,481
So that's how you take it.

408
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,529
Calmly.

409
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,403
You'd let me leave.

410
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,820
Yes, if you don't want to stay.

411
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:14,237
If we separate,
nothing will ever interest me again.

412
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,483
You had ambitions for “our love.”

413
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,403
It's your pride talking,
not your grief.

414
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,538
But I do feel grief.

415
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,500
Sodol.

416
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,702
Not as much as I do.

417
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,543
There's so little difference.

418
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,894
I said not to yell!
Daniel has a fever!

419
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,902
These kids get on my nerves!

420
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,136
- Did he throw up?
- Yes.

421
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,313
- Several times?
- Starting yesterday.

422
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,328
Why didn't you call me sooner?

423
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,497
He's never been sick before.

424
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,583
I didn't know.

425
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,740
Little Daniel! Dear lord!

426
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,236
What a tragedy!

427
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,367
Poor Daniel!

428
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,649
Have you seen Raphael?

429
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,574
Call him. The train's at 7:00.

430
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,671
- Raphael, come here!
- What?

431
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,378
Why do you want him?

432
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,593
They've come to take him to jail.

433
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,523
They want you in montpellier today.

434
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,316
How many days?

435
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:50,280
Five. It'll pass quickly.

436
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,740
So you say.

437
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,453
Move it if you want
to stop by your place.

438
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:13,721
Poor kid. Try not to let
my husband see you.

439
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,052
Poor Anna.

440
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:20,557
Seeing me with you two,
he'll give his daughter hell.

441
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,850
We'll let you go alone...

442
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,104
Through the neighborhood.

443
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,231
Go change clothes

444
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:33,157
and meet us in the last car
on the 7:00 train.

445
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,195
- You'll take responsibility?
- Yes, I've known him for years.

446
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,913
This really tears me up.

447
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,082
This isn't our business.

448
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:45,662
Go on, and don't get us in trouble.

449
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,840
Dad, I have a problem.

450
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,468
I took 62 pounds of clams
to the fishmonger,

451
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,803
and he gave me credit for 56.

452
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,599
If he cheated you
out of six pounds,

453
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,014
he's stealing your hard work.

454
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,899
These fishmongers!

455
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,068
They make me puke.

456
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,233
Go back out.

457
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,783
I got the report from beziers
on the samples.

458
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,872
It says there's bacteria.

459
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,458
Impossible.

460
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,042
Afraid so.
I'll show you the report.

461
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,591
I say they're in cahoots
with montpellier.

462
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,336
You can still file a petition.

463
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,760
6:00.

464
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,385
I have to pick up rosette at 6:45.

465
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,647
I don't have time
to get into the work,

466
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,643
but 20 francs is 20 francs,
and a half hour is a half hour.

467
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,358
Better than going to jail.

468
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,643
- I'll teach you!
- I did nothing wrong.

469
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,811
- You're too young to see boys.
- Mama got married at 19.

470
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,690
What's going on?

471
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,659
He got slapped
because Daniel died.

472
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,029
Come with me.

473
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,507
I'll buy you some licorice.

474
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:07,141
When she's of age,
she can marry anyone she wants.

475
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,932
Jules, you can do as you wish.
You're the father.

476
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,398
But I gave you my daughter
when she was 19.

477
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,070
Madame repeto
had to convince you.

478
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,402
Madame repeto.

479
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,239
This woman forgets everything...

480
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,278
But she remembers that.

481
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,659
You got her, didn't you?

482
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,951
Is this a family meeting?

483
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,460
About Anna again?

484
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,631
Do as you wish.
She's your daughter.

485
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,750
But she's mine too.

486
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,837
I don't want her
to go through what I did.

487
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,923
Sorry, papa, but you were tough.

488
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,676
You tried to hang on to us forever.

489
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,848
Now it's up to her.

490
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:52,936
I'm not saying she should
get married. She's 16.

491
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:56,440
But if it's serious, let her see him.

492
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,855
Then they can get married.

493
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,732
They're old enough to start.

494
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,703
We've already shit out
half our crap.

495
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,040
And if the bastard is out
to take advantage?

496
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,285
He's no bastard. He's too dumb.

497
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,457
He got caught.

498
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,708
Now he's fretting about you in jail.
You'll spoil his stay.

499
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,460
While Anna's under my roof,

500
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,255
no one's going
to take advantage of her.

501
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:40,153
You're as happy here
as if the whole world were yours.

502
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,367
Especially finding a woman
standing next to me!

503
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,448
What an encounter!

504
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,870
Don't speak of an encounter.

505
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,791
The time is long past
when we didn't know each other.

506
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,215
I know your tastes,
your quirks, your ways.

507
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,721
Your habits have become my own.

508
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,348
There can be no more surprises.

509
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:15,181
Yes, you know my quirks
and my ways...

510
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,062
But you couldn't live my life.

511
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,153
Knowing someone
is something else entirely.

512
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,689
You never came here...

513
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:26,200
Yet it's half my life.

514
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,695
You don't have
to think about me.

515
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,532
Don't think about anything.
Look around.

516
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,584
As if you'd been here for years...

517
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,623
Like a Shepherd ends up guarding
the secrets of the landscape

518
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,875
more than his animals.

519
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,007
What about him?
Is he guarding the fish?

520
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,880
He's waiting for them...

521
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,049
Watching out for them.

522
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:54,395
Go ahead!

523
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,768
Nice and easy!

524
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,890
Did you spot some mullet?

525
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,936
Yes, and we're gonna
make 'em jump.

526
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,986
In Paris it seemed so natural
having you as a partner.

527
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:36,288
But here I feel how strange
our connection really is.

528
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,872
I wonder why I'm here
where you chose to be born.

529
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,006
Chose?

530
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,442
I came here to leave you.

531
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,778
There are better things to do.

532
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:12,029
I came to make noise,
but silence has won out.

533
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,656
It's so quiet.

534
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:17,367
This is our first
real vacation together.

535
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,215
It's true.

536
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,429
We traveled in years past,

537
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,516
but always to places
neither of us knew.

538
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,438
Perhaps you dreamed
of other women here before.

539
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,152
Which ones?

540
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,863
You know everything
about my youth.

541
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,158
Don't go crawling backwards,
my little crab.

542
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,694
Were you happy?

543
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,158
Let's not discuss that.

544
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:08,001
I gave you everything to share,
not to tear apart.

545
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,671
I've nibbled enough
on your memories from before me.

546
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,509
Silly woman.

547
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,910
Look.

548
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,216
My only ambition when I travel

549
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,719
is to see something like this
now and then.

550
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,720
“Ambition”!
Do you even know that word?

551
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,471
I spent my childhood
in these boatyards.

552
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:34,567
A shipbuilder builds boats
and repairs them.

553
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,228
That's all.

554
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,190
My dad never thought of expanding.

555
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,442
He died young...

556
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,413
But he'd have gotten old
the same way, quietly working away.

557
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,583
So many people come
to Paris to succeed

558
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,748
and make a place for themselves.

559
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,788
I was born there...

560
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,504
And saw lots
of hustle and bustle.

561
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:02,262
For a long time I thought
hustling was a good thing.

562
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,266
You've taught me to keep still.

563
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,477
I love this ship!

564
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,109
It's our home's attic.

565
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,736
There must be rats.

566
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,916
If you've learned to keep still,
stop running around.

567
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,756
You'll fall. Be careful!

568
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,141
People here don't like talk
about being “tired.”

569
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,977
You'll come to hate it too.

570
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,811
Here, when they say,
“he's very tired,” it means...

571
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,851
“He's about to die.”

572
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,898
Things between us
would have been so much easier

573
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:06,071
if I'd been born here
next door to you.

574
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,828
You exaggerate.

575
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:13,709
I wouldn't have fallen for you
if you'd been just like me.

576
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:18,756
The resemblance
has to grow bit by bit.

577
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,884
On the red boat...

578
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,513
Raphaél scotto
of the “sporting Lance.”

579
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,853
- You okay?
- Fine.

580
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,147
- Having fun?
- Yes.

581
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,150
You haven't said a word.

582
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,198
I'm fine.

583
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,833
I said, “Alexandre,
if you don't want to joust, stay home.”

584
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,666
On the blue boat...

585
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,665
Albert soldino
of the “sporting Lance.”

586
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,541
On the red boat...

587
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,553
Auguste calcazani
of the “golden shield.”

588
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,776
- See that?
- Be quiet!

589
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,395
Fine.

590
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,440
Albert soldino has qualified
for a return match.

591
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,448
Now we'll hear from the band.

592
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,740
An ice cream.

593
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,774
A warming fo jouster sebastien

594
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,114
for illegal posture on his perch.

595
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:13,077
All aboard on the blue boat

596
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,896
Its like this
every Sunday in summer,

597
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,820
minus the tribune and the officials.

598
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,033
Is there a crowd every Sunday?

599
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,407
Yes, from 2:00 till 7:00.

600
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,704
You can watch that long?

601
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,087
Isn't it always the same? Maybe.

602
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,171
But if you knew
all the jousters like I do...

603
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,553
Their little tricks and schemes.

604
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,007
And even if
you don't follow completely,

605
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,385
it's a sight I've always known.

606
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,353
I find it delightful.

607
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,750
Albert, you're not afraid
of the water?

608
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,260
You want a flag
like your jousting uncle?

609
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,638
They gave la pointe
a fine tournament.

610
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,803
Yeah, but like always...

611
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,520
They put the people over there
and the tribune in the shade.

612
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,766
You know the officials
don't like to come here.

613
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,728
After what they pulled on us,

614
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:54,732
they feel guilty
about refusing our petition.

615
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,785
I told the others
they'd never give in.

616
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,446
Samples, analyses.
It's not worth it.

617
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,706
We'll never get the small lagoon.

618
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,584
We might if we keep trying.

619
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:10,251
No, they want us
to move to the big lagoon.

620
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:14,092
Well, what if we refuse?
Right. We'll keep hounding them.

621
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,129
We'll take samples every year
till one of them says...

622
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,050
“Why keep harassing
these people?

623
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,809
Let "em fish.
There's so little bacteria.”

624
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,313
- There's no one there like that.
- Who knows?

625
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,858
Admit it's fun and lively here.

626
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,069
No longer sorry you came?

627
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,779
I didn't know.

628
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,274
I kept telling you!

629
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:42,033
You listened like I was telling stories,
and not my story.

630
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:45,783
You were in love
with “our love,” not me.

631
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,659
Now I'll love you...

632
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,954
Native of la pointe courte,
son of a shipbuilder,

633
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:54,503
fan of jousting and the sun.
My word!

634
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,169
You'll never again reproach me
or demand anything of me

635
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,430
without thinking of all that.

636
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:06,136
You'll love me very thoughtfully.

637
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:10,182
Why not? Do you love me madly?

638
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,643
I don't think so.

639
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,571
Here's Raphael.

640
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,370
How are you, my boy? - Fine.

641
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,377
Nice tournament.
Going to the dance tonight?

642
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,084
What about it, Anna?

643
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:35,298
Thank you. See you then.

644
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,219
Now you talk to him
and let him dance with Anna.

645
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,971
You're a good man.

646
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,556
He jousted well.

647
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:47,097
He'll be a real man.

648
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,223
Every time he approached,
I'd try to nail him.

649
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,312
But nothing doing.

650
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,561
Then he'd come back around.
I'd try again.

651
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,238
Bang! He'd slip free again.

652
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,404
- Weren't you in jail?
- He escaped.

653
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,653
No, I asked for a leave.

654
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,914
I proved I was on the jousting list.

655
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,200
You're lucky.

656
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,379
I'm going back tomorrow
for two more days.

657
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,755
- They're leaving tonight.
- Odd people.

658
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,675
Some vacation!
Always running around like dogs.

659
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,929
They talk too much to be happy.

660
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:09,138
You don't look well.
Anything wrong?

661
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,976
Lie down a minute.

662
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:18,105
Maybe you got too hot
this afternoon.

663
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:21,112
At least I had some ice cream.

664
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,987
Your ice cream.

665
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,568
I'll never forget it.

666
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,658
You know...

667
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,289
I thought you'd left...

668
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,163
Like you said the first day.

669
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,957
You thought I'd left?

670
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,590
I'd never just leave like that.
How do I know?

671
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:43,004
- You know me completely.
- Yes.

672
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,838
But your mind changes all the time.

673
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,134
I'm always a day or two behind.

674
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,681
I'll keep you up to date.

675
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,853
Have you made a decision?

676
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,855
I've made no decision...

677
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,693
But I've faced the facts.

678
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,025
The bonds between us
are stronger than us both.

679
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,909
We've lost the first flower
of our love.

680
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:20,835
The emotion, discovery, desire...

681
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,048
The passion.

682
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,968
And I can't get over it.

683
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:32,513
But adult love based on knowing
each other is a passion...

684
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:36,137
That's less external, less fragile...

685
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,439
A bit like maternal love
that nothing can truly diminish.

686
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,235
Are you sure
all that is about me?

687
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,570
Yes, you.

688
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,462
Now I know how much I love you...

689
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,457
And no one will ever set me free.

690
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,132
Set you free?
I never tied you down.

691
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:13,425
Of course not.
And we may not always live together.

692
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,935
If you love me as you say,

693
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,555
I'll never let you go.

694
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,268
Together or apart,
nothing will ever separate us.

695
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:28,072
You love me quietly
just like you live quietly.

696
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,867
Yet you're trapped just as I am.

697
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,035
I don't feel trapped.

698
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,160
You will.

699
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:46,549
You really think
you stole my soul?

700
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,214
Yes, and you stole mine.

701
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,921
Fine, but what does that change?

702
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,798
Nothing.

703
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:59,141
But it's good to know
what we've traded our youth for.

704
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,058
What do you think?
Was the trade-off worth it?

705
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,272
I don't know.

706
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,741
Is that the canal water
on the ceiling?

707
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,612
Yes. The moon's shining
on the canal.

708
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,795
Gentlemen, silence, please.

709
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:54,047
And now for something different.

710
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,429
Monsieur de rubi
will sing us a song.

711
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,098
Monsieur de rubi,
also known as néné.

712
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,438
I'll sing “I love only you.”

713
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,767
I love only you

714
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:16,278
ever since my lips knew

715
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:19,618
the fever of your kiss

716
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,244
I love only you

717
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:27,790
and my heart dreams only

718
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,039
of that intoxicating moment

719
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:36,048
despite myself, my voice
implores you night and day

720
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:42,183
for I fear you won't be back

721
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:46,687
but when [I see you
everything sings with me

722
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:54,899
I love only you

723
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:07,242
This is dragging on.
I'd better step in.

724
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:11,128
Well?

725
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:15,208
All done eating?
The dance is starting.

726
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,676
We have time.

727
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:23,175
So he grabs the dish
and slips his hand under it...

728
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,913
Quiet, everyone!

729
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:42,633
I'm proud to award Albert soldino
the grand jousting trophy.

730
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,056
Let's hear it for Albert!

731
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,533
Look at him, papa.

732
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,869
After all his grumbling,

733
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,749
he can still have fun
like a young kid.

734
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:59,414
Parties don't change a thing,
but they make us feel good.

735
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,016
Time for bed, kids.

736
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,731
You were right to be
so calm the day I arrived.

737
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,366
In a few days you'll start again.

738
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,279
You'll do your
“this can't go on” number again.

739
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,155
Maybe.

740
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,874
But now I know it's pointless.

741
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,161
You're resigned to it.

742
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,251
Resigned, reassured...

743
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,208
Delighted.

744
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,720
We'll still have secrets.

745
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,387
A couple's secrets
bring them closer.

746
01:18:56,523 --> 01:19:00,107
But no one knows
if the secrets are happy or sad.

747
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,255
Come on, kids.

748
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,586
I lost my hanky.

749
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:28,340
- Louisette?
- Coming!

750
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:32,923
When you bring back
the basket and plates,

751
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,263
don't forget the towel.

752
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:40,102
Mine has a little ring in the corner.

753
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,769
Cast off.

754
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:51,075
Uncle Noel, don't drown
all the kittens in the canal.

755
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,527
Save me one.

756
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,081
The little black-and-white one
with the white belly.

757
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,623
This kid's getting on my nerves
with his kitten.

758
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,838
Isn't pomponette enough for you?

759
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:08,630
We'll have to look after his kitten.

760
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:20,684
Good-bye, noél.

761
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,225
Don't forget the towel!

762
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,444
Watch your feet.

763
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,947
He's no trouble, ma'am.
Don't worry.

764
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,323
I'm thirsty.

765
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,162
Some coffee, ma'am?

766
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,453
For him? Oh, no.

767
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,963
If his mother doesn't touch it,
he doesn't need any.

768
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:51,882
But you're very kind.
When do we get to Paris?

769
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,800
Tomorrow morning.
