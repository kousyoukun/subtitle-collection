1
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,634
Hello.

2
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,402
There's a guy out by the fig tree.

3
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,862
- Who?
- I don't know.

4
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:05,973
Still there?

5
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,184
Must be an inspector.
Nobody knows him.

6
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,811
You'd better tell your dad.

7
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,480
Dédé, go and tell Grandpa.

8
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,941
No, tell Uncle Jules first.

9
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,194
Take some grapes.

10
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,163
There's a guy by the fig tree.

11
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,207
- So?
- Dad doesn't know him.

12
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,336
I'll go and see.
I bet he's an inspector.

13
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,008
Anna, go and warn Grandpa.

14
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:53,937
Grandpa, got anything in the yard?
There's a stranger hanging around.

15
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:59,693
They must've seen me this morning.

16
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,281
Me, I didn't see them.
I fish wherever I want!

17
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,787
- What's it all about?
- I don't know.

18
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:34,269
I don't know if it's this cabin.

19
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,732
But you made me wait
in this heat for an hour!

20
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,692
This must be it.

21
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,071
Why are you barging in like this?

22
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,781
Do you know who I am?

23
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,408
I don't care!

24
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,535
Board of Health.

25
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,957
Put that away and get out!
Should've shown it sooner!

26
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,001
You know I have the right to search.

27
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:02,047
Should've shown your ID
and a warrant first.

28
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,175
- I have one.
- It's too damn late!

29
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,303
I found you breaking in here like thieves!

30
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,806
Maybe you wanted to steal something!

31
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,767
I'm gonna kick your arses out of here!

32
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,770
Now he says we're thieves?
What's your name?

33
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,815
I won't tell you!
What's this tyranny?

34
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,567
This is my house.

35
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,277
- Mrs Soldino?
- Yes.

36
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,738
- Board of Health. May we come in?
- Of course.

37
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,702
- What do you want to see?
- Oh, nothing.

38
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,880
Did your husband go fishing
this morning?

39
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,008
Well, when he got up this morning

40
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,636
he had a pain in his hand
and when he wanted...

41
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,762
Wanted what?

42
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,973
When he wanted...

43
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:02,191
Don't you see she's senile?
My mother-in-law.

44
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:06,069
You're upsetting everybody!

45
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,863
Come on, get lost!

46
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,742
We're quietly eating
and they show up like gangsters!

47
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,702
We'll see at the police station.

48
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,206
OK! And I'll file a complaint
for illegal entry.

49
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,417
- No one will believe you.
- They will!

50
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:25,047
I'll give you as much hell
as you gave us!

51
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,934
Hassling us?
They don't even know why!

52
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,187
- This'll cost you dear!
- Not a chance!

53
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,607
- Come on, Jules.
- Coming!

54
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,859
As soon as they leave us alone.

55
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,946
Looking in cabins...
to find what?

56
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,114
You make me laugh!

57
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,658
You'll see!

58
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,117
I fooled them.

59
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:58,080
I went through the hole
and got the basket from the cabin.

60
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,873
It's under the bed.

61
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,334
I'm coming!

62
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,457
Puss, puss, puss.

63
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,630
Did they come to hassle your dad?

64
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,676
Jules took care of them,
need I say more?

65
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,699
The mistral's blowing again.

66
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,875
I heard you were here.

67
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,418
How are you, Louis?

68
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,629
Are you here for a while?

69
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,755
Yes.

70
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,590
How long?

71
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,967
A little while.

72
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,805
See you!

73
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,190
I meant some time ago,
not yesterday.

74
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,817
You're sure somebody!

75
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,237
When I was 20, I could jump
in the water and jump out dry!

76
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,615
Listen to him! What a guy!

77
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,412
I'll go and see.

78
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,373
He already met
the Paris train yesterday.

79
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,709
- Who's he expecting?
- His wife.

80
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,420
- Doesn't he know when?
- He says he doesn't.

81
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,190
- How are you, gorgeous?
- How did you know when I was coming?

82
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,735
- I came every morning.
- For the past five days?

83
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,238
You're sweet.

84
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,622
He didn't seem like a skirt-chaser
but he got himself a pretty one.

85
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,874
In Paris there are lots like her.

86
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,876
Did they recognise you?

87
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,338
They'd forgotten me a bit after 12 years,
but once they saw me...

88
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,964
Do you recognise me?

89
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,842
I know you by heart.

90
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,594
My face hasn't changed, has it?

91
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,371
See? This is La Pointe-Courte.

92
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,249
You've talked about it so often.

93
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,240
There's the house where I was born.

94
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,871
- That one?
- Yes.

95
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,374
There's the boatyard.

96
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,339
I've wanted to come back
for a long time.

97
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,884
Why didn't you come back sooner
without me?

98
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,011
With or without you...

99
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,056
It was the same to you.

100
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,517
I don't mean that...

101
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,813
but what I've found here
is for me alone.

102
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,517
Besides, you never wanted to come.

103
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,645
You always said
there was nothing to see.

104
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,189
It's true. Look.

105
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,408
Me, I like to see things.

106
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,535
I don't.

107
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,580
You mean I forced you
to go on our trips.

108
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,044
I was happy to be with you.

109
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,924
I'm glad you're here, but...

110
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,052
this isn't about us.

111
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,306
Life's a pleasure here.

112
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,811
You think so?

113
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,189
I don't.

114
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,491
Let's talk about it at once!

115
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,477
I came to tell you we should separate.

116
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,819
That's all you could figure out,
after five days alone?

117
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,240
I've been thinking about it for longer that.

118
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,702
So that was it.

119
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:20,248
We were meant to go on a trip,
we didn't go,

120
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,043
something of yours always cropped up.

121
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,882
The holiday time went by,
and since I've no imagination,

122
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:33,762
I came here,
thinking you'd come a day or two later.

123
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,436
You arrive five days later...

124
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,272
and in what a state!

125
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,195
You're tired.

126
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,405
You need rest...

127
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,616
and some sunshine.

128
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:13,093
It's very serious.
We must talk. That's why I came.

129
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,304
I'm sure it's very serious.

130
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,020
Where are you taking me?

131
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,703
To a house. Well, a shack.

132
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,997
You can see it over there.

133
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,084
There I shall say,
"Hello, Laurent, this is my wife,

134
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,086
"who's come for a rest

135
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,047
"and to get to know the country."

136
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,304
Your "homecoming" number is amusing.

137
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,807
Luckily I'm not from here.

138
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,269
We'd look like we were hired
by the tourist office.

139
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,131
Laurent!

140
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,636
Laurent, can we cross over?

141
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,847
- Swimming.
- By boat?

142
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,974
- Use the bridge!
- It's too far!

143
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,186
- Rowing is too hard!
- It's not that hot!

144
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,772
- I'm fixing the bike!
- Make an effort!

145
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,983
OK, I'm coming!

146
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,307
Laurent, this is my wife.

147
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,517
Hello, madame.

148
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,978
Couldn't you use the bridge?

149
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,857
It wasn't there before.
I always used to cross this way.

150
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,069
Don't get used to disturbing me
when I'm working.

151
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,322
I've got the bike, some customers
and the hot sun.

152
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,866
The bike always needs working on.

153
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,161
I'm busy. I've got work to do.

154
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,213
You'll like this, Maxime. His wife.

155
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,343
She's from the north. Paris!

156
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,887
You'll be able to say
bad things about us!

157
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,807
If they've just got married,
they'll have time.

158
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,476
It's been four years.

159
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,436
I didn't know!

160
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,773
You don't look tired.

161
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,818
We're from good stock.

162
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,279
It's Maxime who's wrong.

163
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,072
Shut up!

164
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,177
Very nice!

165
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,306
It's brand-new. Clean.

166
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,320
What a treat!

167
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,114
And there's water...

168
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,869
Well, there's water when there's water.

169
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,413
It was connected this year at Issanka.

170
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,540
Then they out it off.

171
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,001
With any luck we'll have water next year.

172
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,508
See you later, folks.

173
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,137
How marvellous!

174
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,019
What a lovely room!

175
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,938
We'll go for walks.

176
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,776
What's the difference?

177
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,034
Is something wrong?

178
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,955
Do you know why?

179
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,792
I'm a bit scared...

180
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,294
of us.

181
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,590
We'll go slowly.
We'll be careful.

182
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,134
Never enough.

183
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,054
My delicate one!

184
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,807
My trampler.

185
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,478
Come on.

186
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,438
Let's have lunch.

187
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,740
Soldino, I just came by
and you weren't here.

188
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,700
I was having a nap.

189
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,246
Talk louder! I can't hear!

190
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,290
You're deaf? Since when?

191
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:41,546
I went deaf after the flu last winter!

192
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,507
At the cinema I kept asking my wife,

193
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,509
"What's he saying?"

194
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,887
I could tell the lips were moving
but that's all!

195
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,889
- Is your son here?
- Which one?

196
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,433
Louis!

197
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,560
He's in his cabin.

198
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:30,636
Louis, they're coming
for the samples tomorrow.

199
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,930
- At last!
- Who?

200
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,850
The advisory board.

201
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,644
He'll come with us in the boat

202
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,398
to see if we're taking the water
from the bottom.

203
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,858
You told them why?

204
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,487
They can't say no.
I didn't say a thing.

205
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,533
We'll take it to Béziers
to the Michel Laboratory.

206
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,456
We'll say it's for the Mauguio Lagoon

207
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,877
to find out if it's the water
that rots our nets so fast.

208
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:06,339
The Board of Health can't stop us?

209
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:11,552
No, if we pay for the analysis,

210
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,513
we can take it anywhere we want.

211
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,807
You stir things up...

212
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,560
but we never get anything!

213
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,356
You don't stir up a thing
and it does no good!

214
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,192
The small lagoon should be authorised.

215
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,070
There are shellfish there.
The water's clean.

216
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,865
It's worth it!

217
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:36,327
We can still haul in the shellfish.

218
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,832
OK, but we don't like working like this,
as if we were poisoners.

219
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:47,129
You have your nets
but we only get shellfish!

220
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,882
I'm going.

221
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,553
This morning we gave them a hard time.
Tonight we'll be OK.

222
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,180
Unless they call the coast patrol.

223
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,975
I'll send my girl to the bridge.

224
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,851
To keep an eye out.

225
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,899
How about some work?

226
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,902
What did she say?

227
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,488
She said,
"You can ask Dad for my hand,

228
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,033
"before you leave for the army...

229
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,453
"but be careful, he's mean!"

230
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,997
I said, "Do you want me to ask him?"

231
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,541
She said, "I'm so tired."

232
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,917
Tired of you?

233
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:09,879
I don't know if she's tired of me
or of him.

234
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,756
Ask and you'll find out.

235
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,050
I'm going to work.

236
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:13,067
- Who's keeping watch?
- Joseph's little girl is over there.

237
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:16,987
What will we do about these cats?
They're everywhere.

238
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,658
- What?
- That one's big again.

239
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,618
Like the Carmassi woman.

240
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:26,247
Again?
Aren't seven enough for her?

241
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,667
- She's always ready.
- Whose is it?

242
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:33,045
I don't know. Whoever wanted it.

243
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,681
It doesn't bother her.

244
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:50,229
If I was like her,
always ready to reproduce...

245
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:56,944
I'd sit at home with a sign
on my belly, "Do Not Touch".

246
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,238
She doesn't mind.

247
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,950
Stay there!

248
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,727
It's the coastal patrol.

249
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:32,229
A man at the train station saw them.

250
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,106
What a life!

251
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,986
Quick!

252
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,173
Their new boat!

253
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,300
A real thunderbolt!

254
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,951
Where were you fishing?

255
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,789
- Over there by Bouzigues.
- It's not sorted yet?

256
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,417
I didn't have time.
It's too far away.

257
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,961
Sorry, but that's not allowed.

258
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,796
You know it's not!

259
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,674
They're from over there!
They're good!

260
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:26,427
You know it's forbidden
to sort them on shore.

261
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,553
Why?

262
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:31,265
It's not allowed!
You shouldn't have done it!

263
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,185
I'll have to report you.

264
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,731
Give me your full name,
age and address.

265
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:45,821
Raphael Scotto.

266
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,949
20. Registered with the navy.

267
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,368
La Pointe-Courte.

268
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,122
Why didn't he hurry?

269
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,832
He's asleep.

270
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,628
- He could've hidden himself.
- I'm telling you, he's asleep!

271
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,173
He's in love.

272
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,092
It's paid off well for him!
Who's the girl?

273
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,387
- Anna.
- He'll have a ball with her dad!

274
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,765
Finished.

275
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,767
Ready to go!

276
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,186
The label...

277
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,152
Think these six-franc labels
are for nothing?

278
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,655
The department of health
know what we do with them.

279
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:33,369
If our shellfish were really bad
there'd be plenty of corpses by now.

280
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,581
There's something else.
They're always bothering us poor guys

281
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,168
with "healthy" and "unhealthy"...

282
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,795
All that hassle!

283
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:47,675
- Shall we begin?
- In a hurry?

284
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,218
Yes.

285
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,347
You don't love me anymore?

286
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,101
You want to leave me?

287
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,773
So, what's it all about?

288
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,985
If you want to go on living in peace,
I can leave.

289
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:08,445
You only talk about happiness.

290
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,072
Yeah.

291
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:32,177
Being happy at all costs
has got us where we are.

292
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,430
Meaning being happy without thinking.

293
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:42,396
Say what you're thinking.

294
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,733
Do we really love each other...

295
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,695
or do we live together out of habit?

296
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,282
What? The first one
who's had enough should leave,

297
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,492
if their heart tells them so.

298
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:02,624
The heart never tells us that.

299
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,545
The heart never gets enough.

300
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,842
It's the mind that rebels...

301
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,428
or the body.

302
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,392
When I met you,
there were no questions.

303
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,853
I went towards you.

304
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:26,648
One day I saw in the eyes of others
what we call "our love".

305
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:31,153
I saw it frolic about
while others coaxed it.

306
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,698
I saw it grow
while others were jealous of it.

307
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,785
I began to look at it...

308
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,329
I too...

309
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,125
to watch it,
to look after it,

310
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,754
to weave crowns for it
and keep it under glass.

311
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,256
Too late.

312
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,636
It's stuffed. It's as dry
as an old orange blossom.

313
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,598
"Our love".
That's all you say.

314
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,267
You look at it, under glass.

315
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,394
Do you love me or "our love"?

316
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,647
Look at me, not at it.

317
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,483
I'm looking at you...

318
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,320
but not with the same eyes
as before.

319
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,702
You looked at me
with closed eyes then.

320
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,080
I saw no one but you.

321
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,208
Now you're comparing?

322
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,752
No, I'm not...

323
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,005
but I can see the others.

324
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,884
I imagine myself
living differently, elsewhere.

325
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,846
Would you like that?

326
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:44,852
I don't know,
but I don't like having these thoughts.

327
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,438
It's not serious.

328
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,984
No, but it seems monstrous.

329
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:05,873
I never had such thoughts before.
Did you?

330
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:09,001
I've always seen the others.

331
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:14,590
But I don't want to live anywhere
except with you.

332
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,480
We chose one another.

333
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:40,115
Chose? As if we choose
what happens by accident.

334
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,744
We were chosen, elected, crowned.

335
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,956
If it's against nature,
nature will get its revenge.

336
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,585
And it is. It's separating us.

337
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,128
It's separating us?

338
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,632
You can't say we're in love
like at the beginning.

339
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,509
- That's normal.
- Normal!

340
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,305
Like growing old, seeing people
die in a war or in hospital.

341
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,974
You think that's normal?

342
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,936
The two of us are madly in love.

343
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,480
We want nothing else.
We work. Time passes.

344
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,650
Rains, shine,
we get a new cat, a new home,

345
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,443
new friends. We don't care.

346
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,697
But we change.
We're not madly in love like before.

347
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,076
Our love's like an old beau.

348
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,834
Never mind "our love".

349
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,430
I've loved you for a long time
and I'm not unhappy.

350
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,309
When I began to love you,

351
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:53,772
"with the wind in my sails",
as you say, I thought...

352
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,733
"I'll make her happy."

353
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,612
I watched you live, talk,
laugh and make noise.

354
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,991
I knew I'd like your noise
above all others,

355
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:07,286
and the more I knew you,
the more I'd love you.

356
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,747
We're not in love like at first.
What of it?

357
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,501
I didn't choose love at any price.
I chose you,

358
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,714
to love you a lot,
then perhaps a bit less...

359
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:21,258
but to be with you.

360
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:27,264
- Tell me I don't know how to love.
- No, you love more than I do.

361
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,893
You devour, with closed eyes.

362
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,605
You have ideas. I don't.

363
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,317
I don't have any ideas.

364
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:39,609
I love differently.

365
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:43,322
You can't tell me our love hasn't aged.

366
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,326
It's enough to cry about all day.

367
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,635
You can't remain bitter all your life

368
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:09,431
because we've aged together
in the course of four years?

369
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,392
What else can we do?
We've tried everything.

370
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,064
You cheated on me.
I tried to cheat on you.

371
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,690
What was the point?

372
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,487
Since then, I love you even more.

373
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,074
I realise what we have together.

374
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,076
Well done!

375
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:32,871
I realise what we no longer have

376
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,748
and how heavy an affair is.

377
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,877
- If you were lighter...
- I'd be the happiest of women!

378
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,006
Instead, you're the most unhappy.
I've had enough.

379
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,175
I'm kindness itself.

380
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,636
Except for work,
I think only of your happiness.

381
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,306
I'm patient and caring
and you're unhappy.

382
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,683
And why? For nothing!

383
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:05,487
Instead of a haven for each other

384
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,781
it's a constant revolt.

385
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:15,080
You'd rather give me up
and see me leave,

386
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,959
anything rather than give up
your quiet little life.

387
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,170
Well, I'll let you work

388
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,632
and live in peace,
but I won't sit in a corner!

389
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,634
I'll live without you too!

390
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,844
Why wait?

391
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:33,140
We work better alone,
don't feel the time slip by.

392
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,934
Perfect! Honest at last!

393
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,813
Keep talking, my darling!
What about me?

394
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,524
I don't judge you.
I say what I think.

395
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,693
Don't you do the same?

396
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:48,572
Yes. And I judge us.

397
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,198
Guilty!

398
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,702
I judge you.
You're either blind or a coward.

399
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:57,497
You didn't dare break our little habits?
Break them.

400
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,624
You'll be at ease again.

401
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,918
I've decided to live alone.

402
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,005
Don't be a martyr!

403
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,757
Keep your room.
The apartment's big enough.

404
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,093
I'll find my spot there
when I get back.

405
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,762
That's how you react.

406
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,389
Calmly.

407
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,684
You'd let me leave.

408
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,812
Yes, if you don't want to stay.

409
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,722
If we separate,
nothing else will interest me.

410
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,935
You had ambitions for "our love".

411
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,688
It's your pride talking, not your pain.

412
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,649
But I do feel pain.

413
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,735
So do I.

414
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,862
Not as much as I do.

415
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,991
There's so little difference.

416
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:30,006
I said not to shout the odds!

417
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,841
Daniel has a fever.

418
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,263
These kids get on my nerves!

419
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:50,086
- He threw up?
- Yes.

420
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,215
- Several times?
- Since yesterday.

421
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:18,782
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- Because he's never ill.

422
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,576
I didn't know.

423
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:26,141
Little Daniel!

424
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,271
What misfortune!

425
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,680
Have you seen Raphael?

426
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,983
Call him. The train's at seven o'clock.

427
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,156
- Come on, Raphael!
- Me?

428
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:10,078
- Why do you want him?
- We've come to take him to prison.

429
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,679
They want you in Montpellier today.

430
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,138
For how long?

431
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,432
Five days. It'll soon be over.

432
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:32,892
So you say!

433
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,854
Let's go, if you want to stop
at your place.

434
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:55,081
Poor child!
Try not to let my husband see you!

435
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,000
Poor Anna!

436
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:58,501
He knows,

437
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,713
but seeing me between you two,
he'll give his daughter hell.

438
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,843
We'll let you leave
the neighbourhood alone.

439
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,596
Go and change,

440
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,932
and meet us
on the seven o'clock train

441
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,559
in the last car.

442
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:18,521
- You'll be responsible for this, then?
- Yes, I've known him for years.

443
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:23,318
This really hurts me.
It isn't our concern.

444
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:27,071
Go on and don't get us into trouble!

445
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,621
Dad, I've got a problem.

446
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:37,624
I took 28 kilos of cookies
to the fishmonger,

447
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,084
and he gave me credit for 25.

448
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,671
If he made you lose three or four kilos,

449
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,798
he stole your tiredness off you!

450
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,260
Those fishmongers!

451
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:54,474
Makes me sick.

452
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,685
Go back out.

453
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,981
Béziers sent me a report
on the samples.

454
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,942
It says there's bacteria.

455
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,568
Impossible!

456
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:10,406
I'll show you the report.

457
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,618
I reckon they're in cahoots
with Montpellier.

458
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,412
You can still prepare a petition.

459
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,375
Six o'clock!

460
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,337
I have to pick up Rosette
at quarter to seven.

461
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,256
I don't have time
to get into the work,

462
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:31,678
but 20 francs is 20 francs,
a half-hour's a half-hour.

463
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,559
Better to go there than to prison.

464
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,420
- I'll teach you!
- I did nothing wrong!

465
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:09,716
- You're too young to be going steady.
- Mum got married at 19!

466
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,725
What's wrong?

467
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,936
He got slapped
because Daniel is dead.

468
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,313
Come with me!

469
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,492
I'll buy you some liquorice.

470
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,087
Once she comes of age,
she can marry anyone she wants!

471
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,133
Jules, you can do as you wish.
You're the father.

472
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,595
But I gave you my daughter
when she was 19!

473
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,722
Madame Repeto had to help.

474
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,391
Madame Repeto.

475
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,561
She forgets everything,

476
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,772
but she remembers that.

477
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,732
You got her, didn't you?

478
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,611
Is this a family council?

479
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,405
About Anna again?

480
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,616
Do as you wish.
She's your daughter.

481
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:19,243
But she's mine too.

482
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,371
I don't want her to go through
what I did.

483
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,500
Sorry, Dad, but you were tough.

484
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,710
You tried to hang on to us forever.

485
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,796
Now it's up to her.

486
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,300
I'm not saying she'll get married.
She's 16.

487
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,637
But if it's serious, let her go steady.

488
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,598
Then they may get married.

489
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,683
They're old enough to begin.

490
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:46,896
We're already halfway through this shit.

491
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,817
And if the bastard fools around?

492
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,236
He's no bastard. He's too dumb.

493
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:55,446
He let himself get caught.

494
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:59,742
Now he worries about you in prison.
You'll spoil his stay.

495
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,787
As long as Anna's under my roof,

496
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,997
no one'll fool with her.

497
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:21,430
You look as happy here
as if the world belonged to you.

498
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,435
With a woman that I'd find
standing next to me.

499
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,563
What an encounter!

500
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,026
Don't talk about encounters.

501
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,738
The time when we didn't know
one another is long past.

502
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:44,328
I know your tastes,
your quirks, your mannerisms.

503
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,789
Your habits have become my own.

504
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,834
There are no more surprises.

505
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,170
I could live in your stead.

506
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:57,008
Yes, with my quirks and mannerisms,

507
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,135
but that's not living.

508
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,430
Knowledge is something else.

509
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:05,057
You had never come here,

510
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:07,435
and yet this is half of my life.

511
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,314
You have no need to think of me.

512
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,942
Think of nothing. Look around.

513
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,987
As if you'd been here for years,

514
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,116
like a shepherd guarding
the secrets of the landscape

515
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,076
better than his animals.

516
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,536
And this one.

517
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,998
- Is he watching the fish?
- He's waiting for them.

518
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,125
He's looking after them.

519
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,545
Go ahead!

520
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,965
Take it easy!

521
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,926
Did you spot some mullet?

522
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,304
Yes, some mullet.
We're going to make them jump.

523
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,267
In Paris it seemed normal
to have you as a partner.

524
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,315
Here I can feel the strangeness
of our connection.

525
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:26,157
I wonder why I'm here in this spot
where you chose to be born.

526
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,367
Chose?

527
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,677
I came here to leave you,

528
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,804
but there are better things to do.

529
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:53,351
I came to make noise
and silence has won out.

530
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,770
What a rest!

531
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,481
It's our first holiday.

532
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,959
True. The other years we travelled...

533
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:23,214
it was always to places
unknown to both of us.

534
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:29,720
Here you've already had dreams.
Perhaps with others? With whom?

535
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,015
You know all about my youth.

536
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,477
Don't walk backwards, my little crab.

537
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,896
Were you happy?

538
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,609
Let's not discuss that.

539
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:48,656
I gave you everything
to be shared, not torn apart.

540
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:52,493
I've nibbled enough on your memories.

541
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,620
You dirty animal!

542
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:09,028
Look.

543
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,117
For travel, my only ambition

544
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:00,412
is to see something like this
from time to time.

545
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:05,334
Ambition?
Do you know that word?

546
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,797
I spent my childhood
in these boatyards.

547
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,635
A shipyard builds boats.

548
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,429
It repairs them. That's all.

549
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,642
My dad never thought of expanding.

550
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,269
He died young,

551
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:27,398
but he'd have aged the same way,
calmly working.

552
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,485
In Paris, so many people
want to succeed

553
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,862
and make a place for themselves.

554
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,739
I was born there...

555
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,910
and saw lots of bustle around me.

556
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,205
For a long time I thought
it was useful to bustle.

557
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:47,585
You taught me to keep still.

558
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,929
I love this ship!

559
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,640
It's our home's attic.

560
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,184
It must have rats!

561
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:20,117
If you've learned to keep still,
don't get so excited.

562
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:23,245
You'll fall. Be careful!

563
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,710
Here you don't like being tired.

564
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:32,504
You'll come to hate it too.

565
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,009
Here, when they say,
"He's very tired," it means

566
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,219
"He's about to die."

567
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,932
Everything would have been easier
for us

568
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,728
if I'd been born next door to you.

569
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:49,813
Too much!

570
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,608
I wouldn't have loved you

571
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:55,152
if you were like me.

572
01:00:55,277 --> 01:01:00,282
The resemblance
must grow little by little.

573
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:11,877
<i>On the red boat,</i>

574
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:15,464
<i>Raphael Scotto
from the Sporting Lance!</i>

575
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,009
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

576
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,303
- Having fun?
- Yes.

577
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,394
You haven't said a word.

578
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:30,354
I'm fine.

579
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,569
I said, "Alexandre,
if you don't want to joust, stay at home!"

580
01:01:37,695 --> 01:01:42,658
<i>On the blue boat, Albert Soldino
from the Sporting Lance!</i>

581
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,618
<i>On the red boat,</i>

582
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:48,372
<i>August Calcazani
from the Golden Shield!</i>

583
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,761
Be quiet!

584
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,388
I am! I am!

585
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:07,766
<i>Albert Soldino has qualified
for a return match!</i>

586
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,895
<i>And now a word from the band!</i>

587
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,067
Monsieur, an ice cream!

588
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,973
Each Sunday in summer is like this,

589
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,517
minus the tribune and the officials.

590
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,064
Is there a crowd every Sunday?

591
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,525
Yes, from two o'clock until seven.

592
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,652
Can you watch for that long?

593
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:27,239
- It's always the same, isn't it?
- Maybe.

594
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:31,410
But if you knew the jousters as I do,

595
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:34,872
their passes and little tricks.

596
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:37,332
Even if you don't understand the game,

597
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:41,378
it's a sight I've always known

598
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:43,338
and it enchants me.

599
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,993
Albert, are you afraid of the water?

600
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,203
Want a flag like your jousting uncle?

601
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:18,665
They gave La Pointe a fine tournament.

602
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,709
Yes, but like always,

603
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,671
they put La Pointe over there
and the tribune in the shade.

604
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,800
You know the officials
don't like to come here.

605
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:31,845
After what they pulled on us,

606
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:36,892
they feel uneasy
for refusing our petition.

607
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,978
I told you they'll never give in.

608
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,522
Samples, tests...
It's not worth it.

609
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,650
We'll never get the small lagoon.

610
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,486
If we keep trying, maybe...

611
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,780
They want us to leave.

612
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:52,658
They want us at the big lagoon
and if we won't move...

613
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:55,035
So we'll keep after them.

614
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:59,373
Each year we'll take samples
till one of the officials says,

615
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:02,167
"Why keep giving them a hard time?

616
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,045
"Let them fish!
There's so little bacteria!"

617
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,215
- There's no health official like that!
- Who knows?

618
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,010
Admit that it's cheerful here.

619
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,221
No longer sorry you came?

620
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:15,931
I didn't know.

621
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:18,475
But I often told you all about it.

622
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,188
You listened to me like I was
telling stories, not "my story".

623
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,650
It was "our love",
not me that you loved.

624
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:28,527
Now I'll love you,

625
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:32,072
native of La Pointe-Courte,
son of a boat builder,

626
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,199
fan of jousting and the sun.

627
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,079
You won't blame me
or ask me for anything

628
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,623
without thinking of all this.

629
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:47,504
You'll love me very thoughtfully.

630
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,466
Why not? Do you love me madly?

631
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,011
I don't think so.

632
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,648
Here's Raphael.

633
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,359
- How are you, boy?
- Fine.

634
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,487
I hope you'll be at the dance tonight.

635
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,197
What about it, Anna?

636
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:15,824
Thank you.

637
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,788
Now you talk to him
and let him dance with Anna!

638
01:07:21,913 --> 01:07:22,914
You're good.

639
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:28,211
He jousted well.
He'll be a real man.

640
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,215
Each time he came,
I tried to get him first.

641
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,509
There was nothing to be done!

642
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:38,221
On the next pass, he came back.
I tried again.

643
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,098
Bang! He unhooked me.

644
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:42,142
Weren't you in prison?

645
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,518
He escaped!

646
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,729
I asked for leave.

647
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:49,024
I proved I was on the jousting list
and here I am!

648
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:51,401
You're lucky!

649
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:55,530
I'm going back tomorrow
to do two more days.

650
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,955
- They'll leave tonight.
- They're odd.

651
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:08,085
Some holiday!
Always trotting around like dogs!

652
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,922
They talk too much to be happy.

653
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:50,210
You don't look good.
Is something wrong?

654
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:52,170
Lie down a bit.

655
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,719
Maybe you were too hot
this afternoon.

656
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,514
I at least had some ice cream.

657
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,685
Your ice cream.

658
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,062
I'll remember it.

659
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,689
You know...

660
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,025
I thought you'd gone,

661
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,153
like you said the first day.

662
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,446
You thought that?

663
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,491
- I'd never go like that.
- How do I know?

664
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:24,119
- You know me absolutely.
- Yes.

665
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:28,331
But your mind changes all the time.

666
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:31,334
I'm always a day or two behind.

667
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:33,879
Don't worry, I'll keep you up to date.

668
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,839
Have you made another decision?

669
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,133
Nothing's decided...

670
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,928
but I've faced the facts.

671
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,976
The bonds between us
are stronger than we are.

672
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:57,319
We've lost the juvenile side of love.

673
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:02,407
The turmoil, the discovery, the emotion,

674
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,367
the passion.

675
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,287
And I can't get over it.

676
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:13,585
But adult love based on knowledge
is a passion...

677
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:17,464
less external, not so fragile...

678
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:22,802
rather like maternal love
that nothing can truly hurt.

679
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:27,140
Are you sure that concerns me?

680
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:33,813
Yes, you!

681
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,906
Now I know how I love you,

682
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,867
and no one will ever free me from it.

683
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,330
Free you? I never tied you down.

684
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:54,709
True. And we may not always
live together.

685
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,254
If you love me as you say...

686
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:59,381
I'll never let you go again.

687
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:04,511
Together or apart,
nothing will ever undo us.

688
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:09,474
You love me calmly,
as you live calmly.

689
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,936
Yet you're trapped just as I am.

690
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,522
I don't feel trapped.

691
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,148
You will.

692
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,492
You think you stole my soul.

693
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,287
Yes, and you stole mine.

694
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,831
If you wish,
but what does that change?

695
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,457
Nothing.

696
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,376
But...

697
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:40,422
it's good to know
what we've traded our youth for.

698
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:44,551
Do you think it's worth the exchange?

699
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:46,177
I don't know.

700
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,393
Is it canal water on the ceiling?

701
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,604
Yes, because the moon's in the canal.

702
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:33,034
Gentlemen, a little silence, please!

703
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,161
Now for something different!

704
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:38,456
Monsieur de Ruby
is going to sing us a song!

705
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:44,295
Monsieur de Ruby!

706
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:47,882
I am going to sing "I Love Only You".

707
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:48,485
This is long! I'd better step in!

708
01:14:50,695 --> 01:14:52,363
Well?

709
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:56,242
Have you finished eating?
The dance is starting! Are you coming?

710
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,453
We've got time!

711
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:16,114
Quiet! Quiet!

712
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm proud to present to Albert Soldino
with the Grand Jousting Trophy!

713
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,083
Let's hear it for Albert!

714
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:30,146
Look at him, Dad.
After all his complaining

715
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:34,025
he still enjoys himself
like a young boy!

716
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:40,365
The party doesn't change a thing
but it makes us feel good.

717
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,589
Time for bed, children.

718
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:05,848
You were right to be so calm
the day I arrived.

719
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,476
In a few days, you'll start again.

720
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:12,689
You'll do your "This can't go on!" number
for me again.

721
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:14,315
Maybe.

722
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,026
But now I know it's pointless.

723
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,320
You feel resigned?

724
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,574
Resigned, reassured,

725
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,284
enraptured.

726
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,835
A couple's secrets...

727
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,380
Bring them closer.

728
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:41,092
But no one knows
if the secrets are happy or sad.

729
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,322
Come on, kids!

730
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:06,951
Auntie, I've lost my hanky!

731
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,662
- Louisette!
- Coming!

732
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:14,876
When you bring back the basket,
don't forget the towel!

733
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,763
Cast off!

734
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:32,602
Uncle Noël, don't drown
all the kittens in the canal!

735
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,562
Save me one!

736
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:39,442
The little black-and-white one
with the white tummy!

737
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:42,403
This little boy's annoying me
with his kitten!

738
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:46,073
Isn't Pomponette enough for you?

739
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,951
We'll have to look after his kitten!

740
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,912
Don't drown it!

741
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,460
Bye, sonny.

742
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,547
Goodbye, Noël.

743
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:06,302
Goodbye, Noël!
Remember the towel!

744
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,395
Be careful of your feet!

745
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,689
He's really no trouble, madame.

746
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,399
I'm thirsty!

747
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,193
Some coffee, madame?

748
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,487
For him? I don't think so!

749
01:20:24,612 --> 01:20:28,115
If his mother never touches it
he doesn't need any.

750
01:20:31,369 --> 01:20:32,870
When do we get to Paris?

751
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,997
Tomorrow morning.
