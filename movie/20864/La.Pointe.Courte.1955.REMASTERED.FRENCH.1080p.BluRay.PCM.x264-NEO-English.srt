1
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,699
Hello!

2
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,951
A guy's out by the fig tree.

3
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,682
- Who?
- I don't know.

4
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:05,765
Still there?

5
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:08,947
Must be an inspector.
Nobody knows him.

6
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:10,546
Ya better tell your dad.

7
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:12,977
Dédé, go tell Grampa.

8
00:05:13,452 --> 00:05:15,545
No, tell Uncle Jules first.

9
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,815
Take some grapes!

10
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:28,459
There's a guy by the fig tree.

11
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:31,592
- So?
- Dad doesn't know him.

12
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll bet he's an inspector.

13
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,572
Anna, go warn Grampa.

14
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:53,085
Grampa, got anything in the yard?
A stranger's hanging around.

15
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,158
They must've seen me
at Faugat this morning.

16
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,459
Me, I didn't see them.
I fish wherever I want!

17
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,099
- What's it all about?
- I dunno.

18
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,382
I don't know if it's this shack.

19
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,491
But you made me wait
in this heat for an hour!

20
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,424
This must be it.

21
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,925
Where are you going,
barging in like this?

22
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,694
Do you know who I am?

23
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:47,403
I don't care! I don't know you!

24
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,435
Board of Health!

25
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,904
Put that away and bug off!
You shouldve shown it sooner!

26
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,910
You know I've the right to search.

27
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:01,313
Shouldve shown your ID
and a warrant first.

28
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,587
- I have one.
- It's too goddamn late!

29
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:08,190
I found you breaking in here like thieves!

30
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,690
Maybe you wanted to steal something!

31
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,590
I'm gonna kick your asses out of here!

32
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,426
Now he says we're thieves?

33
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:16,623
What's your name?

34
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,668
I won't tell you!
What's this tyranny?

35
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:21,463
This is my place.

36
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,140
- Mrs. Soldino?
- Yes.

37
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,003
- Board of Health. May we come in?
- Of course.

38
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,944
- What do you want to see?
- Nothing...

39
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,624
Your husband went fishing
this morning?

40
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,728
Well, when he got up this morning...

41
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,455
he had a pain in his hand
and when he wanted...

42
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:50,657
Wanted what?

43
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,036
When he wanted...

44
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,571
Don't you see she's senile?
She's my mother-in-law.

45
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,870
You're upsetting everybody!

46
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,669
Come on, get lost!

47
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,679
We're quietly eating
and they show up like gangsters!

48
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,490
We'll see about this at the station.

49
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:17,086
OK! And I'll file a complaint
for illegal entry.

50
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,517
- No one will believe you.
- They will!

51
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:24,393
I'll give you as much hell
as you gave us!

52
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,733
Hassling us for what?
They don't even know!

53
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,809
- You'll pay dearly for this!
- I doubt it.

54
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,646
- Come on, Jules...
- Coming!

55
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,675
As soon as they leave us alone.

56
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,750
Looking in shacks!
To find what?

57
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,888
You make me laugh!

58
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,488
You'll see!

59
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,023
I fooled 'em.
I went through the hole and...

60
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:57,058
got the basket from the shack.

61
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,671
It's under the bed.

62
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:01,698
I'm coming!

63
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,422
They came to hassle your dad?

64
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:52,228
Jules took care of 'em.
Believe me!

65
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,090
The mistral's blowing again.

66
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:06,676
I heard you were here.

67
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:08,345
How are you, Louis?

68
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:10,343
Are you here for a while?

69
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,571
Yes.

70
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,113
How long?

71
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:15,414
A little while.

72
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,790
So long!

73
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,952
I meant some time ago,
not yesterday.

74
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:31,432
You're sure somebody!

75
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,045
When I was 20, I could jump in the water
and jump out dry!

76
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:38,006
Listen to him! What a guy!

77
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,113
I'll go check.

78
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:46,042
He already met
the Paris train yesterday.

79
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,310
- Who's he expecting?
- His wife.

80
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,784
- Doesn't he know when?
- He says he doesn't.

81
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:52,781
- How are you, beautiful?
- How'd you know when I was coming?

82
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:56,010
- I came every morning.
- For the past 5 days?

83
00:12:57,989 --> 00:12:59,650
You're sweet.

84
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,795
He didn't seem like a skirt-chaser
but he sure found a pretty girl.

85
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,663
In Paris there are lots like her.

86
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:12,535
Did they recognize you?

87
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,900
They forgot me a bit after 12 years,
but once they saw me...

88
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:17,574
Do you recognize me?

89
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:20,438
I know you by heart.

90
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,529
My face hasn't changed, has it?

91
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,396
See? This is La Pointe Courte.

92
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,401
You've talked about it so often.

93
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:24,208
There's the house I was born in.

94
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,840
- That one?
- Yes.

95
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,512
There's the boatyard.

96
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,689
I've wanted to come back
for a long time.

97
00:14:41,226 --> 00:14:43,490
Why didn't you come back sooner
without me?

98
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,753
With or without you...

99
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,493
It was the same to you.

100
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,268
I didn't say that...

101
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,364
but what I've found here is mine only.

102
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,828
Besides, you never wanted to come.

103
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,432
You always said
there was nothing to see.

104
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:38,538
It's true. Look!

105
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,053
I like to see things.

106
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,022
I don't.

107
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,597
You mean I forced you
to go on our trips.

108
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:00,297
I was happy to be with you.

109
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:05,436
I'm glad you're here.

110
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,676
But this isn't about us.

111
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:12,708
Life's a pleasure here.

112
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:17,516
You think so?

113
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,889
I don't.

114
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,524
Let's talk about it at once!

115
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:58,927
I came to tell you
we should separate.

116
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:07,167
That's what you figured out,
after 5 days alone?

117
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:12,142
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

118
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,805
So that was it.

119
00:17:15,646 --> 00:17:19,446
We were to go on a trip,
we didn't go...

120
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:22,414
you were always delayed.

121
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,816
The vacation time went by...

122
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,116
and since I've no imagination...

123
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,956
I came here...
thinking you'd come a day or 2 later.

124
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:41,103
You arrive 5 days later...

125
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,838
and in this state!

126
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,706
You're tired.

127
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,274
You need rest...

128
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,478
and some sunshine.

129
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,964
It's very serious.
We must talk. That's why I came.

130
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,639
I'm sure it's very serious.

131
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:23,543
Where are you taking me?

132
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:40,490
To a house. A shack...

133
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,359
You can see it over there.

134
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,935
I'll say "Hello, Laurent!
This is my wife...

135
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,002
who's come for a rest...

136
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,738
and to get to know the area."

137
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:57,708
Your "homecoming" number is amusing.

138
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,410
Luckily I'm not from here.

139
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,615
We'd look like we were hired
by the tourist office!

140
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:32,611
Laurent!

141
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:38,421
Can we cross over?

142
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,716
- Swimming.
- By boat?

143
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:42,916
- Use the bridge!
- It's too far!

144
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,925
- Rowing is too hard!
- It's not that hot!

145
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,429
- I'm fixing the bike!
- Try a little harder!

146
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,461
OK, I'm coming!

147
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,197
Laurent, this is my wife.

148
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,300
Hello, ma'am.

149
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,768
Couldn't you use the bridge?

150
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:32,704
It wasn't there before.
I always used to cross this way.

151
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,970
Don't get used to bothering me
when I'm working.

152
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,172
I got the bike, some customers
and the hot sun.

153
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,817
The bike always needs work.

154
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,783
I'm busy! I got work to do!

155
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:54,897
You'll like this, Maxine. His wife!

156
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:00,072
She's from the north. Paris!

157
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:02,672
You'll be able to say bad things about us!

158
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:05,535
If they're just married,
they'll have time.

159
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,409
It's been 4 years.

160
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:10,085
I didn't know!

161
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,399
You don't look tired.

162
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,540
We're from good stock.

163
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,069
It's Maxine who's wrong.

164
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,833
Shut up!

165
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,625
Very nice!

166
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,601
It's brand new! Clean!

167
00:21:58,282 --> 00:21:59,972
What a treat!

168
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,882
And there's water...

169
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,287
I mean, water when there's water.

170
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:10,292
It was connected this year at Issanca.

171
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,462
Then they cut it off.

172
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:14,858
<i>I hope we'll have water next year.</i>

173
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,962
See you later, folks.

174
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:25,801
How marvelous!

175
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,649
What a lovely room!

176
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,513
We'll go for walks.

177
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:39,581
What's the difference?

178
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,991
Is something wrong?

179
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:52,594
Do you know why?

180
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:55,635
I'm a bit scared...

181
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,939
for us.

182
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,040
We'll go slowly.
We'll be careful.

183
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,011
Never enough!

184
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,511
My delicate one!

185
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:10,643
My trampler!

186
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,853
Come on...

187
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,851
Let's have lunch.

188
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,463
Soldino, I came by earlier
and you weren't here.

189
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:29,366
I was having a nap.

190
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:32,540
Talk louder! I can't hear!

191
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,576
You're deaf? Since when?

192
00:23:37,381 --> 00:23:41,249
I went deaf after the flu last winter!

193
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,113
At the movies I kept asking my wife...

194
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,255
"What's he saying?"

195
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,323
I could tell the lips moved
but that's all!

196
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,625
- Is your son here?
- Which one?

197
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,023
Louis!

198
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,425
He's in his shack.

199
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:30,292
Louis, tomorrow,
they're coming to get samples.

200
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,662
- At last!
- Who?

201
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,203
The advisory board.

202
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:41,369
He'll come with us in the boat
to see if the water's from the bottom.

203
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,505
You told 'em why?

204
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:46,877
They can't say no.
I didn't say a thing.

205
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,855
We'll take it to Béziers
to the Michel Laboratory.

206
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:57,658
We'll say it's for the Mauguio Lagoon...

207
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:02,556
to find out if it's the water
that rots our nets so fast.

208
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:05,866
The Board of Health can't stop us?

209
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:11,111
No, if we pay for the analysis...

210
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,204
we can take it anywhere we want.

211
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:16,441
You stir things up but...

212
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:19,241
we never get anything!

213
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:22,686
You don't stir up a thing
and it does no good!

214
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,982
The small lagoon should be allowed.

215
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:29,090
The shellfish are there.
The water's clean.

216
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,689
It's worth it!

217
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,597
We can still haul in the shellfish.

218
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:41,666
But we don't like working
like we were poisoning people.

219
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:43,703
You have your nets...

220
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:46,843
but we only get shellfish!

221
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,607
I'm going.

222
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,338
This morning we gave them a hard time!
Tonight we'll be OK.

223
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:55,916
Unless they call the coast patrol!

224
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,384
I'll send my girl to the bridge.

225
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,423
To keep an eye out.

226
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,428
What about the work?

227
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:51,774
What did she say?

228
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:54,308
She said "You can ask Papa
for my hand..."

229
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:56,775
"before you leave for the army..."

230
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:00,275
"but be careful! He's mean!"

231
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,782
I said "Do you want me to ask him?"

232
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,419
She said "I'm so tired!"

233
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:06,945
Tired of you?

234
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,625
I don't know if she's tired
of me or of him.

235
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,590
Ask and you'll find out.

236
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,626
I'm going to work.

237
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,816
Who's keeping watch?

238
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,488
Joseph's girl is over there.

239
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,819
What'll we do about these cats?
They're everywhere!

240
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:19,962
- What?
- That one's big again.

241
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:22,494
Like the Carmacci!

242
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:26,076
Again? Aren't 7 kids enough for her?

243
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:29,674
- She's always ready.
- Whose is it?

244
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,503
I don't know. Whoever wanted her!

245
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:43,209
It doesn't bother her.

246
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:49,683
If I was like her,
always ready to reproduce...

247
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:53,487
I'd sit at home with a sign...

248
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,598
on my belly: "Do Not Touch."

249
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:58,528
She doesn't mind.

250
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,474
Stay there!

251
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:31,264
It's the coastal patrol.
A man at the train station saw them.

252
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,600
What a life!

253
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,803
Hurry up!

254
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,991
This new motorboat!

255
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:00,823
A real thunderbolt!

256
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,617
Where were you fishing?

257
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,565
- Between Roucadou and Bouzigues.
- It's not sorted yet?

258
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,230
I didn't have time.
It's too far away.

259
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,513
Sorry, but that's not allowed.

260
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,673
You know it's not!

261
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:23,379
They're from over there! They're good!

262
00:31:23,527 --> 00:31:26,198
You know it's forbidden
to sort them on shore.

263
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:27,339
Why?

264
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:30,645
It's not allowed!
You shouldn't have done it!

265
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,415
I'll have to report you.

266
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:38,218
Give me your name, age and address.

267
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,132
Scotto, Raphael...

268
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,394
20, registered by the navy...

269
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,689
La Pointe-Courte.

270
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,040
Why didn't he hurry?

271
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:56,610
He's asleep.

272
00:31:56,813 --> 00:32:00,010
- He couldve hidden.
- He's asleep, I tell you!

273
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,014
He's in love.

274
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,849
It's paid off big for him!
Who's the girl?

275
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:10,254
- Anna.
- He'll have a ball with her dad!

276
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:12,369
Done!

277
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,393
Ready to go!

278
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,965
The label...

279
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,966
Think a 6-franc Health label
is for nothing?

280
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,574
They know what we do with 'em.

281
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:30,826
If our shellfish were really bad...

282
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,212
there'd be plenty of corpses by now.

283
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,356
There's something else.
Why they bother us, poor guys...

284
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:40,479
with "healthy" and "unhealthy"...

285
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:42,614
All that hassle!

286
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:47,392
- Shall we begin?
- You in a hurry?

287
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,791
Yes.

288
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:52,931
You don't love me any more?

289
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,636
You want to leave me?

290
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,002
So what's it all about?

291
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,614
If you want to go on living in peace,
I can leave.

292
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,142
You only talk about happiness.

293
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,649
Yeah.

294
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,972
Being happy at all costs
has got us where we are.

295
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,268
Being happy without thinking!

296
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,525
Say what you're thinking.

297
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,318
Do we really love each other...

298
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,516
or do we live together out of habit?

299
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:52,995
What? The first one
who's had enough should leave...

300
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:55,027
if their heart says so.

301
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:01,793
The heart never tells us that.

302
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:06,034
The heart never gets enough.

303
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:11,408
It's the mind that rebels...

304
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:13,979
or the body.

305
00:34:17,354 --> 00:34:20,084
When I met you,
there were no questions.

306
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,490
I went toward you.

307
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:26,286
One day I saw in the eyes of others
what we call "our love".

308
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:30,223
I saw it frolic about
while others coaxed it.

309
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,162
I saw it grow
while others envied it.

310
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:37,503
I began to look at it...

311
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,340
me too...

312
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:44,522
to watch it,
to look after it...

313
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:48,111
to weave crowns for it
and keep it under glass.

314
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:50,943
Too late!

315
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:55,387
It's stuffed. It's as dry
as an old orange blossom.

316
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,355
Our love.
That's all you say.

317
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:02,054
You look at it, under glass.

318
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:04,199
Do you love me or our love?

319
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:06,494
Look at me! Not at it!

320
00:35:07,537 --> 00:35:09,437
I'm looking at you...

321
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,302
but not with the same eyes as before.

322
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,982
You looked at me with closed eyes then.

323
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:22,678
I saw no one but you.

324
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:25,684
Now you're comparing?

325
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:28,490
No, I'm not...

326
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,585
but I can see the others.

327
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:35,196
I imagine myself
living elsewhere, differently.

328
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,044
Would you like that?

329
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:44,498
I don't know
but I don't like these thoughts.

330
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,038
It's no big deal.

331
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:51,237
No, but it seems monstrous.

332
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:05,298
I never had such thoughts before.
And you?

333
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:08,597
I've always seen the others.

334
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,996
But I don't want to live
any other way than with you.

335
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,712
We chose one another.

336
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:39,251
Chose? As if we choose
what happens by accident.

337
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,439
We were chosen, elected, crowned!

338
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,479
If it's against nature,
nature gets its revenge.

339
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,035
And it is. It's separating us.

340
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:52,859
It's separating us?

341
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,193
You can't say we're in love
like at the beginning.

342
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,674
That's normal.

343
00:36:57,788 --> 00:36:59,050
Normal!

344
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,952
Like growing old, seeing people
die in a war or at the hospital!

345
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,100
You think that's normal?

346
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,660
The two of us are madly in love.

347
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:11,192
We want nothing else.
We work. Time passes.

348
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:13,832
It rains or not.
We get a new cat, a new home...

349
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,342
new friends. We don't care.

350
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,158
But we change.
We're no longer madly in love.

351
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:23,365
Our love's like an old beau.

352
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,330
Never mind "our love."

353
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:44,584
I've loved you for just as long
and I'm not unhappy.

354
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:49,033
When I began to love you...

355
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:53,195
"with the wind in my sails"
as you used to say... I thought...

356
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,533
I'll make her happy.

357
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:00,186
I watched you live, talk,
laugh and make noise.

358
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:03,618
I knew I'd like your noise
above all others.

359
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,582
The more I'd know you,
the more I'd love you.

360
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,037
We're not in love like the first day.
So what?

361
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:14,131
I didn't choose love at any price.
I chose you...

362
00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:18,178
to love you a lot,
then perhaps a bit less...

363
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,108
but to be with you.

364
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:26,314
- Tell me I don't know how to love.
- No, you love more than I do.

365
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:31,259
You devour, with closed eyes.

366
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:34,526
You have ideas. I don't.

367
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,523
I don't have any ideas.

368
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:39,329
I love differently.

369
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:42,886
You can't tell me
our love hasn't aged.

370
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:46,961
And one could cry about it all day.

371
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:05,525
You can't remain bitter all your life...

372
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,775
because we've aged together
during 4 years?

373
00:39:09,452 --> 00:39:12,250
What else can we do?
We've tried everything.

374
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,116
You cheated on me.
I tried to cheat on you.

375
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,016
What was the point?

376
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,198
Since then, I love you even more.

377
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:26,961
I realize what we have together.

378
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:28,578
Bravo!

379
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,597
I realize what we no longer have...

380
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,894
and how heavy an affair is.

381
00:39:35,145 --> 00:39:38,637
- If you were lighter...
- I'd be the happiest of women!

382
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:42,249
Instead, you're the most unhappy.
I'm fed up!

383
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:44,954
I'm kindness itself.

384
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:47,521
Except for work, I think
only of your happiness.

385
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:51,017
I'm patient and caring
and you're unhappy.

386
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:53,422
And why? For nothing!

387
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:04,638
Instead of a haven for each other...

388
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:07,638
it's a constant revolt.

389
00:40:10,413 --> 00:40:14,679
You'd rather give me up
and see me leave...

390
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:18,044
anything rather than give up
your quiet little life.

391
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:22,183
Well, I'll let you work and...

392
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:25,435
live in peace
but I won't sit in a corner!

393
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:27,496
I'll live without you too!

394
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:28,755
Why wait?

395
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:32,892
We work better alone,
don't feel the time slip by.

396
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:35,663
Perfect! Honesty at last!

397
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:39,706
Keep talking, sweetheart!
I want to hear my fate.

398
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:42,241
I'm not judging you,
just saying what I think.

399
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:44,504
Don't you do the same?

400
00:40:44,714 --> 00:40:47,877
Yes. And I judge us.

401
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:49,883
Guilty!

402
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,521
I judge you.
You're either blind or a coward.

403
00:40:53,723 --> 00:40:57,090
You didn't dare break our little habits?
Break them!

404
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,553
You'll be at ease again.

405
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:01,696
Me, I've decided to live alone.

406
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:04,332
Don't be heroic!

407
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,361
Keep your room.
The apartment's big enough.

408
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,834
I'll find my spot there
when I get back.

409
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,333
That's how you react.

410
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,267
Calmly.

411
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,340
You'd let me leave.

412
00:41:17,714 --> 00:41:20,740
Yes, if you don't want to stay.

413
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,141
If we separate,
nothing else will interest me.

414
00:41:56,986 --> 00:41:59,386
You had ambitions for "our love."

415
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:03,314
It's your pride talking,
not your grief.

416
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:05,423
But I do have grief.

417
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,396
So do I.

418
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,596
Not as much as I do.

419
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:14,461
There's so little difference.

420
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:29,691
I said not to yell!

421
00:42:29,832 --> 00:42:31,586
Daniel has a fever.

422
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:36,081
These kids get on my nerves!

423
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:49,693
- He threw up?
- Yes.

424
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:53,059
- Several times?
- Since yesterday.

425
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:16,058
Why didn't you call me sooner?

426
00:44:16,192 --> 00:44:18,217
Because he's never been sick.

427
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:21,419
I didn't know!

428
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,024
Little Daniel!

429
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,390
What misfortune!

430
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:47,505
Have you seen Raphael?

431
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:58,312
Call him. The train's at 7:00.

432
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,484
- Come on, Raphael!
- Me?

433
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:06,935
Why do you want him?

434
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:09,693
We've come to take him to jail.

435
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:27,179
They want you in Montpellier today.

436
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:28,858
For how long?

437
00:47:29,135 --> 00:47:31,126
5 days. It'll soon be over.

438
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:32,626
So you say!

439
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,328
Let's go, if you want
to stop at your place.

440
00:47:50,353 --> 00:47:54,346
Poor kid! Try not to let
my husband see you!

441
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:56,999
Poor Anna!

442
00:47:57,226 --> 00:47:59,660
He knows, but seeing me
between you two...

443
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,530
he'll give his daughter hell.

444
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:03,724
We'll let you cross...

445
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:06,758
the neighborhood alone.

446
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:08,964
Go change and...

447
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:12,621
meet us at the 7:00 train...

448
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,281
in the last car.

449
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:17,850
- You'll be responsible?
- Yes, I've known him for years.

450
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:22,974
It really hurts me.
This isn't our concern.

451
00:48:23,658 --> 00:48:26,344
Go on and don't get us in trouble!

452
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,691
Dad, I've got a problem.

453
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:37,317
I took 62 lbs. Of cockles
to the fishmonger...

454
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,300
and he gave me credit for 56 lbs.

455
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:43,245
If he made you lose 6 lbs...

456
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:45,393
he's stealing your weariness.

457
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,795
Those fishmongers!

458
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,902
Makes me puke!

459
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,983
Go back out.

460
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:01,578
Béziers sent me a report
on the samples.

461
00:49:01,917 --> 00:49:03,578
It says there's bacteria.

462
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:05,083
Impossible!

463
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:09,753
I'll show you the report.

464
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,355
They're in cahoots with Montpellier.

465
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:16,030
You can still prepare a petition.

466
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,623
6:00!

467
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:23,263
I have to pick up Rosette at 6:45.

468
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,321
I don't have time
to get into the work but...

469
00:49:28,644 --> 00:49:31,828
20 francs is 20 francs,
a half-hour's a half-hour!

470
00:49:35,784 --> 00:49:37,911
Better to go there than to jail!

471
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:05,367
- I'll teach you!
- I did nothing wrong!

472
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:09,027
- You're too young to date!
- Mama got married at 19!

473
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,358
What's wrong?

474
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:21,427
He got slapped
because Daniel is dead.

475
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,922
Come with me!

476
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:36,138
I'll buy you some licorice.

477
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:48,286
Once she's a legal adult,
she can marry who she wants!

478
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:51,975
Jules, you can do as you wish.
You're the father.

479
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:55,207
But I gave you my daughter
when she was 19!

480
00:50:55,515 --> 00:50:57,618
Mme Repeto had to help!

481
00:50:58,646 --> 00:50:59,949
Mme Repeto!

482
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:03,413
She forgets everything...

483
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:05,425
but she remembers that.

484
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:07,218
You got her, didn't you?

485
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:11,029
Is this a family meeting?

486
00:51:11,494 --> 00:51:13,534
About Anna again?

487
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:16,496
Do as you wish.
She's your daughter.

488
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,807
But she's mine too.

489
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,676
I don't want her
to go through what I did.

490
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:24,743
Sorry, Papa, but you were tough.

491
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:27,573
You tried to hang on to us forever.

492
00:51:27,663 --> 00:51:29,683
Now it's up to her.

493
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:33,546
I don't say she'll get married.
She's 16.

494
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:37,518
But if it's serious,
let her date!

495
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,956
Then they may get married.

496
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:42,563
They're old enough to begin.

497
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:46,593
We're already shit out
half our crap.

498
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,597
And if the bastard
wants to take advantage of her?

499
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:53,455
He's no bastard. He's too dumb.

500
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:55,340
He let himself get caught!

501
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:59,615
Now he worries about you in jail.
You'll spoil his stay!

502
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:02,546
As long as Anna's under my roof...

503
00:52:02,785 --> 00:52:04,912
no one'll take advantage of her!

504
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:20,800
Here you're as happy
as if the world were yours.

505
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:26,374
<i>With a woman I'd find
standing next to me.</i>

506
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,099
What an encounter!

507
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,641
Don't talk about an encounter!

508
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:36,961
The time when we didn't know
one another is long gone.

509
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:44,139
I know your tastes,
quirks and manners.

510
00:52:44,322 --> 00:52:46,596
Your habits have become my own.

511
00:52:46,754 --> 00:52:49,255
There are no more surprises.

512
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:52,116
I could live in your stead.

513
00:52:52,554 --> 00:52:56,149
Yes, having my quirks and manners...

514
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:58,573
but that's not living.

515
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:01,736
Knowledge is something else.

516
00:53:02,298 --> 00:53:04,625
You'd never come here...

517
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:07,328
and yet this is half of my life.

518
00:53:08,137 --> 00:53:10,643
You've no need to think of me.

519
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,173
Think of nothing. Look around!

520
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:17,602
As if you'd been here for years...

521
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,480
like a shepherd guarding...

522
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:23,844
the secrets of the landscape
better than his animals.

523
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:25,179
And this one!

524
00:53:25,521 --> 00:53:28,388
- Is he watching the fish?
- He's waiting for them.

525
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:30,556
He's looking after them.

526
00:53:32,488 --> 00:53:34,359
Go ahead!

527
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,715
Take it easy!

528
00:53:37,993 --> 00:53:39,824
Did you spot some mullet?

529
00:53:39,997 --> 00:53:42,657
Yes, some mullet.
We're gonna make 'em jump!

530
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:10,441
In Paris it seemed normal
to have you as a partner.

531
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:16,817
Here, I can feel the strangeness
of our connection.

532
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:25,631
I wonder why I'm here in this spot
where you chose to be born.

533
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:27,893
Chose?

534
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,348
I came here to leave you but...

535
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,366
there are better things to do.

536
00:55:48,568 --> 00:55:52,732
I came to make noise
and silence has won out.

537
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,245
What rest!

538
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,051
It's our first vacation.

539
00:56:15,657 --> 00:56:18,893
True. The other years we traveled...

540
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,157
always to places unknown to both of us.

541
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:29,471
Here, you've already had dreams.
Perhaps with others? With whom?

542
00:56:30,526 --> 00:56:32,573
You know all about my youth.

543
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,827
Don't walk backwards, my little crab.

544
00:56:36,787 --> 00:56:38,536
Were you happy?

545
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:42,957
Let's not discuss that.

546
00:56:44,545 --> 00:56:48,140
I gave you everything
to be shared, not torn apart.

547
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:52,189
I've nibbled enough on your memories.

548
00:56:52,432 --> 00:56:54,161
You wretched thing!

549
00:58:07,307 --> 00:58:08,493
Look!

550
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,764
For travel, my only ambition is...

551
00:58:56,889 --> 00:58:59,881
to see something like this
from time to time.

552
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,774
Ambition? Do you know that word?

553
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,060
I spent my childhood
in these boatyards.

554
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:14,358
A shipbuilder builds boats.

555
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,804
He repairs them. That's all.

556
00:59:18,444 --> 00:59:21,004
My dad never thought of expanding.

557
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:22,974
He died young...

558
00:59:23,115 --> 00:59:26,380
but he'd have aged the same way,
calmly working.

559
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:32,856
In Paris, so many people want to succeed
and make a place for themselves.

560
00:59:33,726 --> 00:59:35,717
I was born there and...

561
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:38,897
saw lots of excitement around me.

562
00:59:39,765 --> 00:59:42,632
For a long time I thought
it was useful.

563
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,068
You taught me to keep still.

564
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:58,383
I love this ship!

565
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:00,943
It's our home's attic.

566
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:03,649
It must have rats!

567
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:19,598
If you've learned to keep still,
don't get so excited!

568
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:22,371
You'll fall. Be careful!

569
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:28,774
Here you don't like being tired.

570
01:00:29,615 --> 01:00:31,810
You'll hate it too.

571
01:00:33,652 --> 01:00:36,450
Here, when they say
"He's very tired," it means...

572
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:38,517
"He's about to die."

573
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:43,126
Everything wouldve been easier for us...

574
01:00:43,796 --> 01:00:47,027
<i>if I'd been born next door to you.</i>

575
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:49,262
Too much!

576
01:00:50,122 --> 01:00:52,113
I wouldn't have loved you...

577
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:54,648
if you were like me.

578
01:00:55,035 --> 01:00:59,631
The resemblance
must come little by little.

579
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:11,684
<i>On the red boat...</i>

580
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,893
<i>Scotto Raphael
from the "Sporting Lance"!</i>

581
01:01:16,796 --> 01:01:18,728
- Are you OK?
- Fine!

582
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:20,866
- Having fun?
- Yes.

583
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:27,766
You haven't said a word.

584
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,071
I'm happy.

585
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:36,342
I said: "Alexandre,
if you don't want to joust, stay home!"

586
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:41,864
<i>On the blue boat, Soldino Albert
from the "Sporting Lance"!</i>

587
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:44,349
<i>On the red boat...</i>

588
01:01:44,557 --> 01:01:47,390
<i>Calcazani Auguste
from the "Golden Shield!"</i>

589
01:02:01,023 --> 01:02:02,406
Be quiet!

590
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:04,071
I am! I am!

591
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:07,040
<i>Albert Soldino has qualified
for a return match!</i>

592
01:02:08,848 --> 01:02:11,112
<i>And now a word from the band!</i>

593
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,617
Sir! An ice cream!

594
01:02:42,314 --> 01:02:45,841
<i>Warning to the jouster Sébastien!</i>

595
01:02:50,689 --> 01:02:53,817
<i>Get in on the blue boat!</i>

596
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,664
<i>Each Sunday in summer is like this...</i>

597
01:04:10,903 --> 01:04:13,167
<i>... minus the tribune and the officials.</i>

598
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:18,677
<i>Is there a crowd every Sunday?</i>

599
01:04:19,044 --> 01:04:21,274
<i>Yes, from 2 till 7.</i>

600
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,495
<i>Can you watch for that long?</i>

601
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:26,574
<i>- It's always the same, isn't it?
- Maybe.</i>

602
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:30,746
<i>But if you knew
the jousters as I do...</i>

603
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:34,291
<i>their passes and little tricks!</i>

604
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,194
<i>Even if you don't understand the game...</i>

605
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:40,852
<i>it's a sight I've always known...</i>

606
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,720
<i>and it enchants me.</i>

607
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:12,593
Albert, are you afraid of the water?

608
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:15,292
Want a flag like your jousting uncle?

609
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:18,466
They gave La Pointe a fine tournament!

610
01:05:18,612 --> 01:05:20,445
Yes, but like always...

611
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:23,932
they put La Pointe over there
and the tribune in the shade.

612
01:05:25,644 --> 01:05:28,613
You know the officials
don't like to come here.

613
01:05:28,814 --> 01:05:31,578
After what they pulled on us...

614
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:35,251
they feel uneasy
for refusing our petition.

615
01:05:36,822 --> 01:05:39,665
I told you they'll never give in.

616
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:42,157
Samples, analyses...
It's not worth it.

617
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:44,352
We'll never get the small lagoon.

618
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:47,045
If we keep trying, maybe...

619
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:49,330
They want us to leave!

620
01:05:49,535 --> 01:05:52,381
They want us at the big lagoon
and if we won't move...

621
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:54,802
So we'll keep after 'em!

622
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,156
Each year we'll take samples
till one of the officials says...

623
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:01,805
"Why keep giving them a hard time?"

624
01:06:02,147 --> 01:06:04,795
"Let 'em fish!
There's so little bacteria!"

625
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:07,943
- There's no Health guy like that!
- Who knows?

626
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:11,614
Admit that it's cheerful here.

627
01:06:11,857 --> 01:06:13,825
No longer sorry you came?

628
01:06:14,026 --> 01:06:15,550
I didn't know...

629
01:06:15,828 --> 01:06:18,160
But I often told you all about it!

630
01:06:18,397 --> 01:06:22,561
You listened to me like I was
telling stories, not my story!

631
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:26,327
It was "our love,"
not me that you loved.

632
01:06:26,538 --> 01:06:28,199
Now I'll love you...

633
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:31,805
native of La Pointe-Courte,
son of a boat carpenter...

634
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:33,953
fan of jousting and the sun!

635
01:06:35,547 --> 01:06:38,914
You won't blame me
or ask me for anything...

636
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:40,916
without thinking of all this.

637
01:06:43,572 --> 01:06:46,837
You'll love me very thoughtfully.

638
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:50,847
Why not? Do you love me madly?

639
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,468
I don't think so.

640
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:06,404
Here's Raphael!

641
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,028
- How are you, my boy?
- Fine.

642
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:12,154
Nice day. You'll be at the dance tonight?

643
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:13,834
What about it, Anna?

644
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:15,581
Thank you.

645
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:21,419
Now you talk to him
and let him dance with Anna!

646
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:22,992
You're a good man.

647
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:27,734
He jousted well.
He'll be a real man!

648
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:32,179
Each time he came,
I tried to nail him first!

649
01:07:32,296 --> 01:07:34,303
There was nothing to be done!

650
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:37,581
<i>On the next pass, he came back.
I tried again!</i>

651
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:40,065
Bang! He unhooked me!

652
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:42,023
Weren't you in jail?

653
01:07:42,177 --> 01:07:43,398
He escaped!

654
01:07:43,568 --> 01:07:45,648
I asked for a leave.

655
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:48,924
I proved I was on the jousting list
and here I am!

656
01:07:49,071 --> 01:07:51,198
You're lucky!

657
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:55,340
I'm going back tomorrow
to do 2 more days.

658
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:03,810
- They'll leave tonight.
- They're odd.

659
01:08:03,929 --> 01:08:07,485
Some vacation!
Always trotting around like dogs!

660
01:08:09,154 --> 01:08:11,423
They talk too much to be happy.

661
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:50,027
Is something wrong?

662
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:51,785
Lie down a bit.

663
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:59,165
Maybe you were too hot
this afternoon.

664
01:08:59,672 --> 01:09:02,170
At least I had some ice cream.

665
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,875
Your ice cream!

666
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,273
I won't forget it.

667
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:10,323
You know...

668
01:09:11,206 --> 01:09:13,184
I thought you'd gone...

669
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:15,981
like you said the first day.

670
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:17,748
You thought that?

671
01:09:18,423 --> 01:09:21,256
- I'd never go like that.
- How do I know?

672
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,758
- You know me completely.
- Yes.

673
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:27,765
But your mind changes all the time.

674
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:31,097
I'm always a day or 2 behind.

675
01:09:31,336 --> 01:09:33,566
I'll keep you up to date.

676
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:35,737
Made your decision?

677
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:37,772
Nothing's decided...

678
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:41,308
but I've faced the facts.

679
01:09:44,483 --> 01:09:47,384
The bonds between us
are stronger than we are.

680
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,822
We've lost the youth of our love.

681
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:01,758
The emotion, discovery, desire...

682
01:10:02,301 --> 01:10:03,825
the passion.

683
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:06,895
And I can't get over it.

684
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:13,236
But adult love based on knowledge
is a passion...

685
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:17,107
less external, not so fragile...

686
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:22,149
rather like maternal love
that nothing can truly hurt.

687
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:26,583
Are you sure all of this is about me?

688
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:33,258
Yes, you!

689
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:42,170
Now I know how I love you...

690
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,139
and no one will ever free me.

691
01:10:47,212 --> 01:10:50,196
Free you? I never tied you down.

692
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:54,528
True. And we may not always
live together.

693
01:10:54,653 --> 01:10:56,587
If you love me as you say...

694
01:10:57,156 --> 01:10:59,415
I'll never let you go again.

695
01:11:00,263 --> 01:11:03,892
Together or apart,
nothing will ever undo us.

696
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:09,057
You love me calmly,
the way you live calmly.

697
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:12,866
Yet you're trapped
just as I am.

698
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:15,025
I don't feel trapped.

699
01:11:15,394 --> 01:11:16,918
You will.

700
01:11:25,256 --> 01:11:27,390
You think you stole my soul.

701
01:11:27,547 --> 01:11:30,175
Yes, and you stole mine.

702
01:11:30,312 --> 01:11:32,610
If you wish, but what does that change?

703
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:34,105
Nothing.

704
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,064
But...

705
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:39,994
it's good to know
what we've traded our youth for.

706
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:44,226
Do you think it's worth the exchange?

707
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,921
I don't know.

708
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,228
Is it canal water on the ceiling?

709
01:11:53,374 --> 01:11:56,036
Yes, because the moon's in the canal.

710
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:32,785
Gentlemen, a little silence, please!

711
01:13:32,938 --> 01:13:35,016
And now for something different!

712
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,973
M. De Ruby is going to sing us a song!

713
01:13:41,346 --> 01:13:43,780
M. De Ruby!

714
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:47,317
I'll sing "I Love Only You."

715
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,786
<i>I love only you</i>

716
01:13:51,056 --> 01:14:00,658
<i>Since my lips have met
The fever of your kiss</i>

717
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:06,029
<i>I love only you
And my heart rises...</i>

718
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:17,132
<i>My voice despite me
Implores you night and day</i>

719
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:23,180
<i>Because I fear
You won't be back</i>

720
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:27,701
<i>But when I see you
It all sings with me</i>

721
01:14:27,826 --> 01:14:36,668
<i>I love only you
Only you!</i>

722
01:14:44,576 --> 01:14:48,068
This is long! I'd better step in!

723
01:14:50,549 --> 01:14:51,743
Well?

724
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:56,091
Have you finished eating?
The dance is starting! Are you coming?

725
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:58,052
We've got time!

726
01:14:58,824 --> 01:15:03,591
They threw the fine in the sea.

727
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:15,746
Quiet! Quiet!

728
01:16:18,537 --> 01:16:23,270
I'm proud to give Albert Soldino
the Grand Jousting Trophy!

729
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:26,490
Let's hear it for Albert!

730
01:17:26,004 --> 01:17:29,563
Look at him, Papa,
after all his complaining...

731
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:33,340
he still has fun
like a youngster!

732
01:17:36,483 --> 01:17:40,442
Parties don't change a thing,
but they make us feel good.

733
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:56,029
Time for bed, kids!

734
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:05,602
You were right to be so calm
the day I arrived.

735
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:08,176
In a few days, you'll start again.

736
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:12,008
You'll do your "This can't go on!"
Number for me again.

737
01:18:12,617 --> 01:18:13,830
Maybe.

738
01:18:14,853 --> 01:18:16,860
But now I know it's pointless.

739
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,855
You feel resigned?

740
01:18:20,892 --> 01:18:23,156
Resigned, reassured...

741
01:18:23,428 --> 01:18:24,861
delighted.

742
01:18:31,302 --> 01:18:33,352
The secrets we're bringing home!

743
01:18:34,706 --> 01:18:37,140
A couple's secrets
bring them closer.

744
01:18:37,274 --> 01:18:40,674
But no one knows
if the secrets are happy or sad.

745
01:19:02,023 --> 01:19:03,137
Come on, kids!

746
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,441
Auntie, I lost my hanky!

747
01:19:06,805 --> 01:19:09,211
- Louisette!
- Coming!

748
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:14,703
When you bring back the basket,
don't forget the towel!

749
01:19:17,769 --> 01:19:20,041
Mine has a loop in the corner.

750
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:26,455
Cast off!

751
01:19:27,992 --> 01:19:32,019
Uncle Noel, don't drown
all the kittens in the canal!

752
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:34,253
Save me one!

753
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:38,819
The little black and white one
with the white belly!

754
01:19:39,437 --> 01:19:42,201
The kid annoys me with his kitten!

755
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:45,695
Isn't Pomponette enough for you?

756
01:19:45,844 --> 01:19:48,684
We'll have to look after his kitten!

757
01:19:48,836 --> 01:19:50,442
Don't drown it!

758
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,949
Bye, sonny!

759
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:00,788
Goodbye, Noel!

760
01:20:03,027 --> 01:20:05,104
Goodbye, Noel!
Remember the towel!

761
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:16,239
Be careful of your feet!

762
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:18,510
He's no trouble, ma'am! Never mind!

763
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:19,974
I'm thirsty!

764
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:22,037
Some coffee, ma'am?

765
01:20:22,171 --> 01:20:23,874
For him, sir?
I don't think so!

766
01:20:23,999 --> 01:20:27,733
If his mom doesn't touch it
he doesn't need any.

767
01:20:31,314 --> 01:20:32,896
When do we get to Paris?

768
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,546
Tomorrow morning.
