1
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,619
Let's talk business.

2
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:17,197
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

3
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:19,566
You know Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

4
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:23,869
He just wants
a little conversation.

5
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,739
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

6
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,710
Maybe he'll listen to you.

7
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:32,772
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

8
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:36,809
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

9
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,662
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Jones.

10
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,745
Remember, neatness counts.

11
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:14,188
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,099
One hour.

13
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,602
What?

14
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,811
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:45,118
What's he look like?

16
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,818
Serious.

17
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,885
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

18
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:59,068
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

19
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,838
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

20
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:11,110
We got company.

21
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,026
Come on.

22
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,168
Stop, man!

23
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,784
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

24
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,959
- Sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

25
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,095
It's cool. Take a nap.

26
00:05:59,323 --> 00:06:01,814
Oh, my God.

27
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:04,019
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

28
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,563
Check the terrace!

29
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,937
- 911 emergency.
- I need help.

30
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,341
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Just stay on the line.

31
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:31,074
I'll just be off a moment.

32
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:33,514
I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

33
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:55,071
DetectiveJefferson.
May I help you?

34
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,106
I'll call you back.

35
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:05,376
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

36
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,249
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

37
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:16,082
Dial this number.

38
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:31,965
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

39
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:35,043
Bye.

40
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,714
- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?

41
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,413
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean, no.

42
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,424
Just for today.

43
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:51,290
So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...

44
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:54,159
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.

45
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,722
Yeah. Right.

46
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,562
Let me speak
to our mutual friend.

47
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,632
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:13,173
Make sure he understands,
and let him go.

49
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:25,461
Do you understand?

50
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,225
- So say it.
- I understand.

51
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,598
Good.

52
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,218
Jesus.

53
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,630
Two milk as usual?

54
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,374
Why did you hide the cigarette?

55
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:27,242
This building's full of rats.

56
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:31,549
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

57
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,895
What happened?

58
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:46,593
I fell off my bike.

59
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:02,174
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

60
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:17,130
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know...

61
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,431
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

62
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,768
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

63
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,864
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

64
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,808
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

65
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:29,903
- I don't know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me.

66
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,638
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

67
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:36,379
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

68
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,889
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

69
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:43,323
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

70
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:46,794
- That's all I know.
- I'm trying to help you out here...

71
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:49,593
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

72
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,965
I gotta disturb him.

73
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:57,402
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

74
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:59,669
I'm telling you the truth.

75
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:03,975
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

76
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:05,876
It's scary.

77
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:09,180
It's almost like a sixth sense.

78
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:12,983
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

79
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,690
I'm telling you the truth.

80
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:26,699
All right.

81
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:30,962
Stan.

82
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:38,003
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

83
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,516
Of course he didn't.

84
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,631
Just do me a favor.

85
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:35,432
Find out who did by tomorrow.

86
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:37,370
Noon.

87
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,514
Malky, wait.

88
00:14:51,588 --> 00:14:54,580
I didn't cut your shit.

89
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:57,024
Find out yourself!

90
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:03,532
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

91
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,296
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

92
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:07,802
clean up the goddamn house!

93
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,930
And stop smoking cigarettes!

94
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:00,876
One!

95
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,478
Two. Take a deep breath in.

96
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,579
Take a deep breath out.

97
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:10,717
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.

98
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:13,558
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

99
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,962
Ready for the legs.
And down.

100
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,735
Sorry, sweetheart.

101
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,678
Squeeze. Release.

102
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:33,943
Good morning.

103
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,076
Hi, honey.

104
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:41,654
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

105
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:44,921
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

106
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,929
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

107
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,954
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

108
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,262
Two and up.

109
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,834
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

110
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:56,565
move a little ass
and go get some food?

111
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:01,042
- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.

112
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:09,581
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

113
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:12,986
You always come up
with somethin', right?

114
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,286
I think I went too far this time.

115
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:18,859
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

116
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:21,294
How about workin'
at home today?

117
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:27,125
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.

118
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,866
- One...
- Now it's my turn!

119
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,568
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

120
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:36,009
- Daddy, she's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

121
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:39,275
Please don't shoot!

122
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:43,709
Fuckin' bitch.

123
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:48,621
- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.

124
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:52,718
When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles...

125
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,787
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

126
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:04,763
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...

127
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:09,244
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, NewJersey.

128
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:12,042
Is Mr. Or Mrs. Lando home?

129
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,009
This is she.

130
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:20,351
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...

131
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:22,787
he told us she had "problems."

132
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,350
As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...

133
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,655
into healthy,
productive young women.

134
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,665
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

135
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,931
Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

136
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,938
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...

137
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:41,067
but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...

138
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:45,080
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...

139
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,083
your tuition will be forfeit.

140
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,745
She's dead.

141
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,699
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

142
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:18,975
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

143
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,413
Hurry up!

144
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,091
Why am I feeling

145
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,100
When things could look black

146
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:42,400
That nothing
could possibly go wrong

147
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,441
This has been
a most unusual day

148
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:52,806
Love has made me see things

149
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:58,752
In a different way

150
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:30,447
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

151
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,924
Always like this.

152
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,064
Keep it.

153
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:56,009
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

154
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:59,014
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

155
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:46,417
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

156
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:50,087
It reminds me of Beethoven.

157
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:58,559
Can you hear it?

158
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:02,502
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

159
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:04,904
you can hear it growin'.

160
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:07,602
You can hear the insects.

161
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:16,285
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

162
00:24:16,352 --> 00:24:18,343
I'm gonna play you some.

163
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:23,656
Daddy!

164
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,206
You better stay here.

165
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:20,949
We said noon.

166
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,354
I've got one minute past.

167
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:32,386
You don't like Beethoven.

168
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,928
You don't know
what you're missing.

169
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:40,401
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

170
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:43,131
So powerful.

171
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:47,335
But after his openings,
to be honest...

172
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,471
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

173
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,743
That's why I stopped!

174
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:02,420
Toss the apartment.

175
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,979
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

176
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,041
I love Mozart!

177
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:37,523
He was Austrian, you know.

178
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:41,393
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

179
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:44,456
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

180
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:48,196
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

181
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,068
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

182
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,008
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

183
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:57,545
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

184
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:15,295
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

185
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,638
Wow.

186
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:21,225
Oh! Fuck!

187
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:23,561
He's dead.

188
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:27,864
Jesus. Look what you did.

189
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:29,867
Stan, you all right?

190
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:52,326
What are you doin'?

191
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:56,455
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

192
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:58,932
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

193
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:02,467
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

194
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:04,130
I'm calm.

195
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:06,401
Stay there, all right?

196
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:12,238
Benny!

197
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,910
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

198
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,650
Take it easy, all right?

199
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,557
Come on.

200
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,366
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

201
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,833
Benny, we're comin' out!

202
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:36,736
Benny, don't fire!

203
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:39,603
Get in there!

204
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:42,166
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!

205
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:45,771
You wear somethin' new and...
Got a light?

206
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,816
Take it easy.

207
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,948
What's happening out there?

208
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,886
It's all right, ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

209
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:56,288
Leave that poor family alone.

210
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:59,850
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

211
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,295
Why don't you
leave them alone?

212
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:06,692
He said go back inside.

213
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:14,340
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

214
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,321
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

215
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:40,926
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

216
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:42,937
Did you really
have to do that?

217
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:01,517
Please open the door.

218
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:01,082
Benny,
there are three kids here.

219
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:03,584
I think Stan killed this girl.

220
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:06,120
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

221
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:08,790
The third one's missing.
Find her.

222
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:20,696
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

223
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,432
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

224
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:55,131
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!

225
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,746
Shit.

226
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,009
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

227
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:15,147
- They found it.
- I know.

228
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:17,188
There it is.

229
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,191
There's cops outside.
We better go.

230
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:23,763
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

231
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,392
What do I say?

232
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:41,175
Tell them...

233
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:45,649
we were doing our job.

234
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,189
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

235
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:07,467
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

236
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:10,535
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

237
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:13,946
Your mother, she...

238
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:15,813
She's not my mother.

239
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:21,481
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

240
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:24,458
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

241
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:26,824
Not a good half at that.

242
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,107
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

243
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:42,110
They killed my brother.

244
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:46,546
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

245
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:48,549
He never used to cry.

246
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:52,610
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

247
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:57,625
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

248
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:01,993
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

249
00:35:02,064 --> 00:35:04,259
But they smell like shit.

250
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:07,725
Not true.

251
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:12,263
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

252
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,271
that's very clean...

253
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,606
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

254
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:22,014
Yes, I do.

255
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:25,212
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

256
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,814
Don't move.
I'll get him.

257
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:32,726
Piggy, where are you?

258
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:36,197
There you are.

259
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,207
Hi, Mathilda.

260
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,971
Hi, piggy.

261
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:59,715
How are you today?

262
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:02,256
I've seen better days.

263
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:14,199
- What's your name?
- Leon.

264
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:18,764
Cute name.

265
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:29,843
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

266
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:43,329
I'm gonna get some more milk.

267
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,415
Holy shit.

268
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,425
Don't touch that, please.

269
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,961
What do you do for a living?

270
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,431
Cleaner.

271
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:21,869
You're a hit man?

272
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,964
Cool.

273
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:44,016
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

274
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,118
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

275
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,028
who killed my brother?

276
00:37:50,098 --> 00:37:53,898
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

277
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:58,030
How about I work for you...

278
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:01,667
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

279
00:38:01,743 --> 00:38:04,803
What do you think?

280
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,905
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

281
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:09,177
I'll even wash your clothes.

282
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:14,822
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

283
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:27,133
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

284
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:31,036
You've had a rough day today.

285
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:36,409
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

286
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,053
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

287
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:57,155
and it's not always like that.

288
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:59,097
You know?

289
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,240
Good night.

290
00:40:24,553 --> 00:40:26,953
You sleep well?

291
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:29,286
Good.

292
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:31,849
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

293
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,452
Not my problem.

294
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:50,309
Read it.

295
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:59,244
You don't know how to read.

296
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,290
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

297
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:05,417
so I'm a little behind.

298
00:41:05,493 --> 00:41:07,017
What's it say?

299
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:11,122
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

300
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,602
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

301
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,471
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

302
00:41:20,508 --> 00:41:24,171
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

303
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:27,238
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

304
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:33,480
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

305
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:36,251
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

306
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:39,225
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

307
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:42,492
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

308
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:46,057
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

309
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,932
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

310
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:51,700
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

311
00:41:51,907 --> 00:41:57,243
But you did open it. So...

312
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:04,942
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

313
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,215
I don't wanna die tonight.

314
00:42:09,691 --> 00:42:12,216
You're just a little girl.

315
00:42:12,294 --> 00:42:15,263
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

316
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:16,662
I'm sorry.

317
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,418
How's that?

318
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:14,413
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

319
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:16,013
You got that?

320
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:20,592
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

321
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:22,596
There is rules.

322
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:26,464
And stop saying "okay"
all the time!

323
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:31,165
Good.

324
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:48,583
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

325
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:53,618
Mister, I have to use it...

326
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,757
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

327
00:43:57,832 --> 00:44:00,164
and I have to practice.

328
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:04,137
Okay, but not after 10:00.

329
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:06,230
- I promise.
- All right.

330
00:44:08,243 --> 00:44:11,212
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

331
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:15,340
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

332
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:16,816
Fill those out, please.

333
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:26,150
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

334
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,758
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

335
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,199
Fourth floor!

336
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:35,759
Thanks, mister!

337
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:39,068
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

338
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:44,777
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

339
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:53,512
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

340
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:55,386
Of course.

341
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,541
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

342
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:25,619
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

343
00:45:42,604 --> 00:45:45,300
There. Finished.

344
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:48,765
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

345
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:52,603
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

346
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:57,880
No. You just look a little young.

347
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:00,415
Thanks.

348
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:11,224
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

349
00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:13,494
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

350
00:46:15,336 --> 00:46:18,169
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

351
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,266
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

352
00:46:22,343 --> 00:46:26,473
What do you think?
Just the theory.

353
00:46:26,514 --> 00:46:28,744
I need this, Leon.

354
00:46:30,518 --> 00:46:32,611
I need time
to get my head together.

355
00:46:32,654 --> 00:46:35,487
Yeah, and I need...

356
00:46:41,262 --> 00:46:42,695
a drink.

357
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:45,756
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

358
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:14,350
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

359
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:16,659
I thought my hearin' was goin'.

360
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:21,634
I says to myself, " Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

361
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:23,500
I like to stay in shape.

362
00:47:23,538 --> 00:47:27,941
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

363
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:31,740
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

364
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:34,441
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

365
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:40,777
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

366
00:47:51,733 --> 00:47:53,257
Check it.

367
00:47:54,769 --> 00:47:57,465
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

368
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:00,530
One thing's got nothin' to do
with the other. Remember that.

369
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:03,843
I will.

370
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:21,862
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

371
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:25,763
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

372
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,028
The closer you get
to being a pro...

373
00:48:28,102 --> 00:48:31,401
the closer you can get
to the client.

374
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:34,908
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

375
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:42,013
Position.

376
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:10,004
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

377
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:12,911
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

378
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,746
And always dress down.

379
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:19,912
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

380
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:27,488
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

381
00:49:27,562 --> 00:49:29,621
Who should I hit?

382
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:31,358
Whoever.

383
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:40,505
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

384
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:43,373
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

385
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:46,811
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

386
00:49:56,457 --> 00:49:59,824
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

387
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:09,536
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

388
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,532
Keep calm.

389
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:23,205
Don't take your eyes off him.

390
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:25,112
Breathe easy.

391
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:28,582
Watch his movement.

392
00:50:31,058 --> 00:50:33,549
Pretend you're running with him.

393
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:39,691
Try to feel his next movement.

394
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:44,638
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

395
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:54,672
Now.

396
00:50:54,749 --> 00:50:56,580
Oh, my God!

397
00:50:56,651 --> 00:51:00,212
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

398
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:04,084
One shot. Not bad, huh?

399
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:06,683
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

400
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:10,458
Can we try
with real bullets now?

401
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:12,499
Not today.
Let's pack up.

402
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:23,174
Like that.

403
00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:08,951
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

404
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:52,699
"It seemed...

405
00:52:54,035 --> 00:52:56,003
to Socrates..."

406
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:05,778
I'll do it.

407
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:22,194
Leon, all we do is work.

408
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:25,357
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

409
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,161
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

410
00:53:29,236 --> 00:53:33,070
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

411
00:53:46,387 --> 00:53:48,048
Like a virgin

412
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:53,189
Touched for the very first time

413
00:53:57,765 --> 00:54:00,791
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

414
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:16,781
Happy birthday to you

415
00:54:16,817 --> 00:54:21,083
Happy birthday, Mr. President

416
00:54:21,122 --> 00:54:23,647
I don't know.

417
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,198
Moustache.

418
00:54:38,205 --> 00:54:41,800
I'm singing in the rain

419
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:44,367
Just singing in the rain

420
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:47,073
- What a beaut...
- Gene Kelly?

421
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:50,114
Good.

422
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:53,018
Your turn now.

423
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,256
Okay, pilgrim.

424
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:05,163
Clint Eastwood?

425
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:17,136
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

426
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:21,170
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

427
00:55:21,248 --> 00:55:23,716
Leon, really brilliant.

428
00:55:26,053 --> 00:55:28,021
Amazing.

429
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:47,169
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

430
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:50,870
Always happy.
No questions.

431
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:55,439
It's like me, you see.

432
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:57,814
No roots.

433
00:55:57,885 --> 00:56:01,514
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

434
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,285
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

435
00:56:10,498 --> 00:56:12,022
You're right.

436
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,900
Wait!

437
00:56:39,593 --> 00:56:44,257
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

438
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:54,807
It's been a long time, Leon.

439
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:02,549
I missed you.

440
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:07,451
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

441
00:57:07,521 --> 00:57:11,514
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

442
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:14,083
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

443
00:57:14,128 --> 00:57:15,527
Tony...

444
00:57:18,465 --> 00:57:23,129
all the money I make,
that you keep for me...

445
00:57:23,204 --> 00:57:25,195
You need some money?

446
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:26,899
Just curious.

447
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:28,908
I've been working
a long time...

448
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:32,537
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

449
00:57:34,648 --> 00:57:40,450
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

450
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:42,989
You met a woman.

451
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:54,558
You gotta be careful
with women.

452
00:57:54,635 --> 00:57:57,604
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

453
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:02,165
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fuckin' ears...

454
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:05,178
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

455
00:58:05,212 --> 00:58:10,149
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

456
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:15,053
You know, about my money...

457
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:19,456
Maybe I could give...

458
00:58:19,526 --> 00:58:21,585
a little...

459
00:58:23,197 --> 00:58:25,461
to someone.

460
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:28,592
You know, to help out.

461
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:35,232
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

462
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:39,609
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

463
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,114
No one knocks off old Tony.

464
00:58:42,182 --> 00:58:44,616
Besides, with a bank...

465
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:48,052
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

466
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:53,185
But old Tony, nothin' to read,
nothin' to write. It's all in his head.

467
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:57,726
I know how to read now.

468
00:58:57,965 --> 00:59:01,059
That's good, Leon.

469
00:59:04,004 --> 00:59:05,494
Your money's here.

470
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:08,302
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

471
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:12,402
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

472
00:59:12,479 --> 00:59:17,041
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

473
00:59:17,117 --> 00:59:21,019
All right.
Now let's talk business.

474
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:24,524
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

475
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:28,652
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

476
00:59:52,052 --> 00:59:54,418
Listen, Mathilda,
you better be careful.

477
00:59:54,455 --> 00:59:57,117
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

478
00:59:58,325 --> 01:00:01,123
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

479
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:03,993
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

480
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:07,998
I want you to stop cursing.

481
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:10,263
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

482
01:00:10,337 --> 01:00:13,431
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

483
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:21,409
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

484
01:00:28,088 --> 01:00:30,716
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

485
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:39,596
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

486
01:00:53,113 --> 01:00:57,277
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

487
01:00:59,753 --> 01:01:03,189
It's the first time for me,
you know.

488
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:06,522
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

489
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:09,494
'Cause I feel it.

490
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,191
Where?

491
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:16,669
In my stomach.

492
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:23,134
It's all warm.

493
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:28,375
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

494
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:36,551
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

495
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,150
I don't think
it means anything.

496
01:01:39,226 --> 01:01:43,094
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

497
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:29,432
How's the practicing going?

498
01:02:59,406 --> 01:03:04,503
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

499
01:03:04,578 --> 01:03:06,512
I understand.

500
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,514
But you're doing all right.

501
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:10,573
I haven't received
any complaints.

502
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:14,849
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

503
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:17,581
That's very smart.

504
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:22,322
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

505
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,489
What does your father do?

506
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:30,394
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

507
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,938
Except he's not really my father.

508
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,342
He's my lover.

509
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:47,683
Think I'll go for a walk.

510
01:04:02,469 --> 01:04:05,961
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

511
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:09,270
- Where you goin'?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

512
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:11,038
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

513
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:15,237
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

514
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:19,376
You got plans?

515
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:26,625
Meet you here?

516
01:05:41,635 --> 01:05:44,103
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

517
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:48,138
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

518
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:52,039
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

519
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:54,444
Bang, we shot him.

520
01:05:57,684 --> 01:06:00,653
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

521
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,087
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

522
01:06:03,156 --> 01:06:05,124
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

523
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,350
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

524
01:06:07,427 --> 01:06:09,452
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

525
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:15,023
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

526
01:06:15,102 --> 01:06:17,627
Cooperation.

527
01:06:21,007 --> 01:06:24,909
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

528
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:29,642
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

529
01:06:40,727 --> 01:06:42,820
Kids should be at school.

530
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,658
Come on, that's my ball!

531
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:51,136
Give that back.
Where you goin'?

532
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:54,731
Damn! Where you goin', man?
That's my ball!

533
01:07:01,548 --> 01:07:03,482
Follow the blue car.

534
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,678
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

535
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:08,186
No, drive slowly.

536
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:11,084
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

537
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:47,617
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.

538
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:53,995
Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!

539
01:07:57,971 --> 01:08:01,065
- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...

540
01:08:01,141 --> 01:08:04,235
our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.

541
01:08:04,478 --> 01:08:06,275
I'm Bianca Ferrar.

542
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:13,952
It's for you.
A present.

543
01:08:16,156 --> 01:08:19,717
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

544
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,495
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

545
01:08:28,568 --> 01:08:30,502
Mr. McGuffin?

546
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:35,501
Can I have a word with you?

547
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:58,952
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

548
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:01,994
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

549
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:05,054
in the D.E.A. Building,
26 Federal Plaza.

550
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:08,593
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

551
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:11,327
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

552
01:10:11,404 --> 01:10:13,269
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

553
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,036
I never lend out my gear.

554
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:17,974
But...

555
01:10:18,044 --> 01:10:20,012
you still have your gun.
Use it.

556
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,413
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

557
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:26,050
Why are you so mean to me?

558
01:10:27,687 --> 01:10:30,121
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

559
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:33,921
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

560
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:37,358
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

561
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:40,793
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

562
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:43,859
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

563
01:10:43,937 --> 01:10:45,905
you expect me to forget?

564
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:48,099
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

565
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:50,006
Blow their fucking heads off.

566
01:10:50,076 --> 01:10:53,045
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

567
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,107
Your life is changed forever.

568
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:03,688
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

569
01:11:03,757 --> 01:11:06,317
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

570
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:09,318
I want love...

571
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:11,696
or death.

572
01:11:12,465 --> 01:11:14,194
That's it.

573
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:18,130
I want death.

574
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:22,003
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

575
01:11:25,845 --> 01:11:27,972
There's this really great game, Leon.

576
01:11:28,048 --> 01:11:31,449
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

577
01:11:35,855 --> 01:11:38,221
The kind of game you love.

578
01:11:50,503 --> 01:11:52,368
If I win...

579
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:56,342
you keep me with you...
for life.

580
01:11:58,445 --> 01:12:00,140
And if you lose?

581
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:03,740
Go shopping alone, like before.

582
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:08,219
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

583
01:12:09,889 --> 01:12:12,756
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

584
01:12:12,826 --> 01:12:14,123
So what?

585
01:12:14,194 --> 01:12:17,220
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

586
01:12:20,033 --> 01:12:21,466
Nothing.

587
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:27,532
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

588
01:12:28,975 --> 01:12:32,240
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

589
01:12:35,315 --> 01:12:37,306
Because if there is...

590
01:12:37,383 --> 01:12:40,750
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

591
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:46,150
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

592
01:12:56,069 --> 01:12:58,037
I love you, Leon.

593
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:16,453
I win.

594
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:36,373
I took a hit.

595
01:13:37,143 --> 01:13:39,509
I need a hand now.

596
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:43,811
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

597
01:13:43,883 --> 01:13:46,010
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

598
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:49,282
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

599
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:51,289
She's 18.

600
01:13:51,357 --> 01:13:53,291
Really?

601
01:13:57,063 --> 01:13:58,963
How about something to drink, Tony?

602
01:13:58,998 --> 01:14:02,399
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

603
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:06,972
Nice tattoo.

604
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:15,038
Manolo, make that two.

605
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,333
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

606
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:40,339
First you find out
where the chain is.

607
01:14:40,406 --> 01:14:43,864
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

608
01:14:43,943 --> 01:14:46,537
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

609
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:49,378
Whatever you want.

610
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,351
- Yes?
- Hi.

611
01:14:53,419 --> 01:14:55,353
It's Susan.

612
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:58,618
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

613
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:01,159
I don't know any Susan.

614
01:15:01,227 --> 01:15:05,288
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

615
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:08,027
The light's out.

616
01:15:08,067 --> 01:15:10,001
It's all dark out here.

617
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:17,676
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

618
01:15:22,382 --> 01:15:25,180
What the fuck are you doing?

619
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:31,652
Open up.

620
01:15:33,459 --> 01:15:36,519
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?

621
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:16,363
Here's okay.
Let it go.

622
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:18,734
I said, "Let it go."

623
01:16:18,972 --> 01:16:21,270
Move. Move over.

624
01:16:22,742 --> 01:16:24,300
Easy. Easy.

625
01:16:24,377 --> 01:16:27,312
Easy. Careful.
You want me...

626
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:31,576
Go ahead. Your turn.

627
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:41,051
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

628
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:43,595
Sir?

629
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:48,691
Sir, it's not my dope.

630
01:16:48,768 --> 01:16:50,736
Sir, look l...

631
01:16:50,803 --> 01:16:52,737
A little left, please.

632
01:16:56,342 --> 01:16:57,775
Before... Ple...

633
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,415
Now, the security shot.

634
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:11,415
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

635
01:17:11,491 --> 01:17:13,789
Aim for the heart and lungs.

636
01:17:13,826 --> 01:17:16,021
There. Right there.
You see?

637
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:18,029
The first shot takes him
out of order.

638
01:17:18,097 --> 01:17:20,827
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

639
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:22,466
Never in the face.

640
01:17:22,535 --> 01:17:25,732
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

641
01:17:25,805 --> 01:17:29,502
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

642
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:32,305
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

643
01:17:32,378 --> 01:17:35,779
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

644
01:17:35,848 --> 01:17:38,248
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

645
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:40,751
What are you fuckin...

646
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,486
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

647
01:17:46,559 --> 01:17:48,789
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

648
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,762
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

649
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:54,595
A damp, black cloth is the best.

650
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:59,834
What you doing?

651
01:17:59,872 --> 01:18:03,239
We said no women, no kids.

652
01:18:03,309 --> 01:18:06,870
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

653
01:18:22,562 --> 01:18:24,792
Now it's clean.

654
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:28,698
Let's get out of here.

655
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,182
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

656
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,380
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

657
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:55,758
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

658
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:59,663
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

659
01:19:03,402 --> 01:19:05,336
Yes.

660
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:08,168
What you doing?

661
01:19:08,241 --> 01:19:10,607
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

662
01:19:10,676 --> 01:19:13,543
Come on. Just a kiss.

663
01:19:13,613 --> 01:19:16,878
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

664
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:21,787
Go sit down.

665
01:19:28,928 --> 01:19:30,862
Enjoy.

666
01:19:36,502 --> 01:19:39,437
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

667
01:19:39,472 --> 01:19:44,500
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

668
01:19:44,577 --> 01:19:48,411
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

669
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:53,676
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

670
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:56,381
Nineteen.

671
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:58,389
Beat you.

672
01:21:02,788 --> 01:21:07,316
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

673
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:57,773
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

674
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:04,506
- Yes?
- Hi.

675
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:06,851
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

676
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:10,719
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

677
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,724
Just a second.

678
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:28,103
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

679
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:30,935
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

680
01:22:35,548 --> 01:22:38,881
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

681
01:22:38,951 --> 01:22:43,047
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

682
01:22:43,122 --> 01:22:45,920
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

683
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:48,425
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

684
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:51,926
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

685
01:22:51,997 --> 01:22:54,522
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

686
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,534
Show it to me, motherfucker.

687
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:08,513
That's the ring trick.

688
01:23:22,194 --> 01:23:26,460
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

689
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:40,807
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

690
01:23:43,716 --> 01:23:46,685
Nicer than people, eh?

691
01:23:46,752 --> 01:23:48,720
I told you that.

692
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,858
You got a problem?

693
01:23:55,728 --> 01:23:57,719
Get the chair. Sit down.

694
01:24:02,902 --> 01:24:06,861
I was thinking.

695
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:13,136
If something happens
to me someday...

696
01:24:13,212 --> 01:24:17,080
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

697
01:24:17,116 --> 01:24:20,085
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

698
01:24:20,152 --> 01:24:24,248
Tony, I thought about my money.

699
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:33,064
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

700
01:24:37,636 --> 01:24:42,539
Her name is Mathilda.

701
01:24:42,608 --> 01:24:45,839
If anything happens to me...

702
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:50,075
I'd like you...

703
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:54,016
to give her...

704
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:58,279
my money.

705
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:03,251
You can count on me, Leon.

706
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:05,820
Thank you, Tony.

707
01:25:09,168 --> 01:25:11,033
I won't be long.

708
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:15,574
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

709
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:19,644
This one is too big.

710
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,737
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

711
01:25:25,651 --> 01:25:27,949
Mathilda, since I met you...

712
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,079
everything's been different.

713
01:25:30,256 --> 01:25:34,784
So I just need some time alone.

714
01:25:37,596 --> 01:25:39,587
You need some time
to grow up a little.

715
01:25:39,632 --> 01:25:42,226
I finished growing up, Leon.

716
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,166
I just get older.

717
01:25:44,203 --> 01:25:47,764
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

718
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:51,567
I need time to grow up.

719
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:08,650
Shit.

720
01:27:23,736 --> 01:27:26,068
Come on! Hustle!

721
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,971
- Good shot.
- Come on.

722
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:35,908
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

723
01:27:36,281 --> 01:27:38,909
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

724
01:27:38,984 --> 01:27:41,350
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

725
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:44,389
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

726
01:27:44,657 --> 01:27:46,716
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

727
01:27:46,825 --> 01:27:50,226
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

728
01:27:50,295 --> 01:27:52,024
a month.

729
01:27:54,299 --> 01:27:56,130
Got change?

730
01:27:57,736 --> 01:27:59,966
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

731
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,234
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

732
01:28:02,307 --> 01:28:03,865
Okay, a year.

733
01:28:04,743 --> 01:28:07,803
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

734
01:28:10,983 --> 01:28:13,383
So go play somewhere else.

735
01:28:16,889 --> 01:28:19,153
I need to think.

736
01:29:16,115 --> 01:29:19,278
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

737
01:29:29,294 --> 01:29:30,818
Food.

738
01:29:34,233 --> 01:29:39,034
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

739
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:40,799
Sign here.

740
01:29:40,873 --> 01:29:42,306
Come here.

741
01:29:45,043 --> 01:29:49,070
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

742
01:29:49,148 --> 01:29:51,082
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

743
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:13,154
Special delivery?

744
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:15,166
Let me guess.

745
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:18,860
Chinese?

746
01:31:21,607 --> 01:31:23,973
Thai, maybe?

747
01:31:26,545 --> 01:31:29,412
I've got it.

748
01:31:29,481 --> 01:31:31,642
Italian food.

749
01:31:48,367 --> 01:31:50,301
What's your name, angel?

750
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:23,460
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

751
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:30,372
Good.

752
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:38,106
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

753
01:32:38,183 --> 01:32:41,084
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

754
01:32:41,153 --> 01:32:45,681
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

755
01:32:48,226 --> 01:32:50,160
So this is something...

756
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:54,429
personal, is it?

757
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:02,531
What filthy piece of shit...

758
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:04,541
did I do now?

759
01:33:04,609 --> 01:33:07,976
You killed my brother.

760
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:13,717
I'm sorry.

761
01:33:22,194 --> 01:33:24,719
And you wanna join him?

762
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:32,431
It's always the same thing.

763
01:33:36,775 --> 01:33:41,678
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

764
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:45,376
that you learn
to appreciate life.

765
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:49,750
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

766
01:33:56,661 --> 01:33:58,151
That's good.

767
01:34:03,135 --> 01:34:07,071
Because I take no pleasure...

768
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:11,672
in taking a life...

769
01:34:11,743 --> 01:34:16,703
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

770
01:34:27,225 --> 01:34:29,693
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

771
01:34:29,761 --> 01:34:33,162
- I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

772
01:34:33,231 --> 01:34:36,098
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

773
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:41,501
Malky was makin' a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

774
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,407
But they got nothin'
to do with it.

775
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:50,346
They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.

776
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:53,509
He was fast.
He fuckin'came out of nowhere.

777
01:34:53,552 --> 01:34:56,521
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.

778
01:34:56,555 --> 01:35:00,218
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

779
01:35:00,292 --> 01:35:03,227
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

780
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:05,388
No women, no kids.

781
01:35:13,405 --> 01:35:16,272
I think
it was somethin' personal.

782
01:35:17,609 --> 01:35:22,842
Death is whimsical today.

783
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:53,639
Blood, do you hear me?

784
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:58,240
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

785
01:35:58,316 --> 01:36:00,648
Would you take her
up to my office?

786
01:36:02,724 --> 01:36:04,214
All right.

787
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:14,760
Jesus fucking Christ.

788
01:36:27,048 --> 01:36:28,572
"Leon, my love.

789
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:31,016
I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.

790
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:35,819
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D.E.A. Building, room 4602.

791
01:36:35,891 --> 01:36:37,859
I'm gonna do them myself.

792
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:41,760
If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.

793
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:45,789
It's for a contract.
Five grand a head, right?

794
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:49,770
I know I'll feel better
after I do this.

795
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,772
I love you."

796
01:36:56,845 --> 01:36:58,676
Wait. I won't be long.

797
01:36:58,747 --> 01:37:01,978
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

798
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:09,920
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

799
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,619
A nine "millie."

800
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:14,821
Bullets.

801
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:16,228
Another nine "millie."

802
01:37:19,768 --> 01:37:21,793
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

803
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:24,839
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

804
01:37:28,977 --> 01:37:30,842
Holy shit!

805
01:37:30,879 --> 01:37:32,608
What's this? Lunch.

806
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,175
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

807
01:37:37,252 --> 01:37:39,243
There's no anchovies on this.

808
01:37:56,771 --> 01:38:00,400
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?
I been here for ten minutes.

809
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:03,202
I did my best.

810
01:38:50,959 --> 01:38:52,392
Do you like it?

811
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,422
Yes.

812
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:58,099
So say it.

813
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:02,068
I like it.

814
01:39:16,985 --> 01:39:18,282
Not thirsty?

815
01:39:27,796 --> 01:39:30,822
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

816
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:33,959
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

817
01:39:34,035 --> 01:39:37,129
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

818
01:39:37,372 --> 01:39:40,899
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

819
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:45,273
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

820
01:39:46,748 --> 01:39:48,807
They just did it to show off.

821
01:39:48,883 --> 01:39:52,512
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

822
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:59,282
Will I like it the first time?

823
01:40:03,398 --> 01:40:05,389
Mathilda, no.

824
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,336
Why not?

825
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:11,999
I just can't.

826
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:15,475
- You love someone else?
- No.

827
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:18,276
I mean...

828
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:24,443
There was someone a long time ago.

829
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:28,084
Before I came to the States.

830
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:31,890
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

831
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,121
She was from
a very respectable family.

832
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:38,890
Mine was...

833
01:40:39,567 --> 01:40:41,432
you know...

834
01:40:43,238 --> 01:40:44,933
not so respectable.

835
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:48,908
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

836
01:40:48,943 --> 01:40:51,207
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

837
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,344
Right.

838
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,906
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

839
01:40:59,287 --> 01:41:01,278
He killed her.

840
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:04,116
One shot through the head.

841
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:11,896
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

842
01:41:13,835 --> 01:41:15,996
They said it was an accident.

843
01:41:18,139 --> 01:41:19,572
So...

844
01:41:21,309 --> 01:41:23,402
one night I...

845
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:25,903
waited for him.

846
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:29,514
Five hundred feet with a lens.

847
01:41:32,387 --> 01:41:34,252
He also had an accident.

848
01:41:35,456 --> 01:41:39,187
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

849
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:43,356
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

850
01:41:43,898 --> 01:41:46,162
I was 19.

851
01:41:49,537 --> 01:41:53,371
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

852
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,409
I've never had another girlfriend.

853
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:05,112
You see, Mathilda...

854
01:42:05,186 --> 01:42:07,245
I wouldn't be a good lover.

855
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:11,252
Okay.

856
01:42:14,362 --> 01:42:16,557
Would you do me one favor?

857
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,189
What?

858
01:42:18,266 --> 01:42:20,598
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

859
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,967
We're gonna share the bed.

860
01:42:23,905 --> 01:42:26,169
I don't think it's a good idea.

861
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,408
It's okay.

862
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:31,978
Put your legs up on the bed.

863
01:42:32,013 --> 01:42:34,072
Yeah. That's nice.

864
01:42:38,419 --> 01:42:40,910
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

865
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:04,511
Good night, Leon.

866
01:43:07,448 --> 01:43:09,313
Good night.

867
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,071
I want a piece of cake first!

868
01:43:39,113 --> 01:43:43,277
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

869
01:44:02,437 --> 01:44:05,429
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

870
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:08,135
When you've killed for us
in the past...

871
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:11,610
we've always been satisfied.

872
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:17,345
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

873
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,352
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

874
01:44:23,524 --> 01:44:27,517
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

875
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:30,655
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

876
01:44:30,732 --> 01:44:34,600
was kind of the Italian type.

877
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:38,503
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

878
01:44:38,573 --> 01:44:41,098
Wait. There's more.

879
01:44:41,175 --> 01:44:43,268
You're gonna love this.

880
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:51,041
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

881
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:55,749
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

882
01:44:55,823 --> 01:44:59,623
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

883
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:03,160
The very same...

884
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:05,290
Italian hit man.

885
01:45:09,837 --> 01:45:12,362
I'm dying to meet him.

886
01:45:17,111 --> 01:45:21,411
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

887
01:45:21,482 --> 01:45:25,612
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

888
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:27,654
Yeah, I forgot.

889
01:45:27,722 --> 01:45:30,657
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

890
01:45:32,293 --> 01:45:35,262
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

891
01:45:36,764 --> 01:45:39,790
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

892
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,734
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

893
01:45:41,803 --> 01:45:44,397
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

894
01:45:44,472 --> 01:45:45,837
Right.

895
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:09,262
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

896
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:31,518
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

897
01:46:31,586 --> 01:46:35,522
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

898
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,218
Is he alone?

899
01:46:38,292 --> 01:46:40,419
Does he expect you?

900
01:46:40,495 --> 01:46:43,658
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

901
01:46:43,731 --> 01:46:46,928
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

902
01:47:35,183 --> 01:47:36,514
Alpha team.

903
01:47:36,584 --> 01:47:40,247
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.

904
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:30,429
What up? Move! Fuck.

905
01:48:35,710 --> 01:48:37,575
Shit.

906
01:48:38,946 --> 01:48:40,937
Alpha team. Man down.

907
01:48:42,316 --> 01:48:44,409
I told you.

908
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:50,950
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "everyone"?

909
01:48:51,025 --> 01:48:53,550
Everyone!

910
01:49:47,448 --> 01:49:49,382
Take this.

911
01:49:55,089 --> 01:49:58,320
Go take a look.

912
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:15,639
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

913
01:50:17,545 --> 01:50:21,481
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

914
01:50:24,585 --> 01:50:26,018
Nobody moves.

915
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:28,988
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

916
01:50:31,525 --> 01:50:34,892
Okay, the girl's comin' out.
Let the girl go.

917
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:48,373
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

918
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:53,704
You're coming with us.

919
01:51:05,926 --> 01:51:07,723
Christ, he shot him!

920
01:51:09,096 --> 01:51:11,656
Bastard!

921
01:51:20,708 --> 01:51:22,073
Move!

922
01:51:26,113 --> 01:51:28,206
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

923
01:51:28,449 --> 01:51:30,542
Come!

924
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:35,416
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

925
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:49,094
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

926
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:54,802
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

927
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:58,703
Stay away from the window.

928
01:52:45,059 --> 01:52:46,583
Come here.

929
01:52:48,996 --> 01:52:50,486
Snipers.

930
01:52:52,566 --> 01:52:56,297
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

931
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:17,956
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

932
01:54:18,586 --> 01:54:22,078
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

933
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:25,990
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting...

934
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:31,020
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

935
01:54:32,633 --> 01:54:34,863
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

936
01:54:34,935 --> 01:54:37,130
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

937
01:54:37,204 --> 01:54:40,037
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

938
01:54:40,074 --> 01:54:42,804
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

939
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,275
Go.

940
01:54:44,345 --> 01:54:47,746
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

941
01:54:51,685 --> 01:54:55,052
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

942
01:54:55,122 --> 01:54:57,090
You've given me
a taste for life.

943
01:54:57,124 --> 01:55:00,389
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

944
01:55:00,628 --> 01:55:02,721
You'll never be alone again.

945
01:55:06,033 --> 01:55:09,196
Please, go now, baby. Go.

946
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:13,798
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

947
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:20,369
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

948
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,315
I love you, Mathilda.

949
01:55:28,389 --> 01:55:30,414
I love you, too, Leon.

950
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:11,022
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

951
01:56:31,218 --> 01:56:33,311
We've got one breathing here!

952
01:56:35,222 --> 01:56:37,452
Get a medic on the horn!

953
01:56:40,994 --> 01:56:43,326
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

954
01:56:46,033 --> 01:56:49,833
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

955
01:56:52,973 --> 01:56:54,531
Let's go! Move!

956
01:56:54,775 --> 01:56:56,436
Get that guy off the stairs!

957
01:56:56,510 --> 01:57:00,071
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

958
01:57:00,147 --> 01:57:03,173
We've got two men comin'
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

959
01:57:25,005 --> 01:57:28,873
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

960
01:57:28,942 --> 01:57:30,933
Move your fuckin' asses.

961
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:33,411
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

962
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,914
Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.

963
01:57:35,983 --> 01:57:37,348
You got it.

964
01:57:37,417 --> 01:57:41,080
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

965
01:57:41,155 --> 01:57:42,782
Did you find the girl?

966
01:57:51,999 --> 01:57:54,490
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

967
01:57:57,437 --> 01:58:01,498
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...

968
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:04,908
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

969
01:58:07,314 --> 01:58:10,511
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

970
01:58:13,887 --> 01:58:16,947
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

971
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,870
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

972
01:58:35,943 --> 01:58:39,344
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

973
01:58:39,413 --> 01:58:43,406
You're all right.
Sit tight.

974
01:58:49,189 --> 01:58:54,593
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

975
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:22,213
Clear the way, men.

976
01:59:31,265 --> 01:59:33,563
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

977
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:29,273
At your service.

978
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:41,750
This is from...

979
02:01:47,834 --> 02:01:50,200
Mathilda.

980
02:02:05,285 --> 02:02:07,185
Shit.

981
02:02:28,542 --> 02:02:30,066
Get out of here!

982
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:36,281
Leon asked me
to help you out...

983
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:40,285
if somethin' happened,
and I think somethin' happened.

984
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:44,153
He put aside
a little cash for you.

985
02:02:44,224 --> 02:02:47,352
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

986
02:02:47,394 --> 02:02:49,794
seein' as how
you're still so young...

987
02:02:49,863 --> 02:02:52,798
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

988
02:02:52,866 --> 02:02:55,130
Like a bank, you know, except...

989
02:02:55,202 --> 02:02:59,229
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

990
02:02:59,306 --> 02:03:01,866
No one knocks off old Tony.

991
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:04,669
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

992
02:03:04,744 --> 02:03:08,680
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

993
02:03:08,748 --> 02:03:12,548
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

994
02:03:13,653 --> 02:03:15,177
Here.

995
02:03:15,255 --> 02:03:20,659
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

996
02:03:20,727 --> 02:03:25,664
A job?
What the hell can you do?

997
02:03:25,732 --> 02:03:27,597
I can clean.

998
02:03:28,902 --> 02:03:31,427
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

999
02:03:31,505 --> 02:03:33,564
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1000
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,404
It's over!
The game's over!

1001
02:03:36,476 --> 02:03:39,274
Leon's dead!

1002
02:03:39,312 --> 02:03:41,280
You hear me?

1003
02:03:48,455 --> 02:03:53,256
Come on. You think
I ain't hurtin' too?

1004
02:03:58,632 --> 02:04:00,964
But he's dead.

1005
02:04:01,201 --> 02:04:05,160
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1006
02:04:06,373 --> 02:04:09,433
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1007
02:04:09,509 --> 02:04:11,568
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

1008
02:04:11,645 --> 02:04:15,877
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1009
02:05:07,267 --> 02:05:10,634
My parents...

1010
02:05:10,704 --> 02:05:12,797
died...

1011
02:05:12,872 --> 02:05:17,502
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1012
02:05:17,577 --> 02:05:19,545
It was terrible.

1013
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:25,815
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1014
02:05:25,885 --> 02:05:30,652
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1015
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,989
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1016
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:39,259
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1017
02:05:41,034 --> 02:05:43,730
But on one condition:

1018
02:05:43,803 --> 02:05:46,966
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

1019
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,338
I want you to take a chance...

1020
02:05:49,409 --> 02:05:52,344
and trust me.

1021
02:05:52,379 --> 02:05:54,847
Tell me what happened to you.

1022
02:05:58,351 --> 02:06:01,411
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. Officers...

1023
02:06:01,488 --> 02:06:04,855
because of a drug problem.

1024
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:07,552
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1025
02:06:07,627 --> 02:06:12,428
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1026
02:06:12,499 --> 02:06:16,401
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1027
02:06:35,722 --> 02:06:39,419
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1028
02:07:05,919 --> 02:07:08,615
I think we'll be okay here.
