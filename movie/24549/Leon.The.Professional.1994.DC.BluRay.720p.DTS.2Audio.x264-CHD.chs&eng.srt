1
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:13,583
片名  这个杀手不太冷

2
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,196
“利昂，你到美国多久了？”

3
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,761
“已经很久了”

4
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,261
好…

5
00:02:12,203 --> 00:02:13,761
我们谈谈生意吧
Let's talk business.

6
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,339
这死胖子在插手莫瑞齐奥的生意
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

7
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,708
你知道莫瑞齐奥是个通情达理的人
You know Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

8
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:25,011
他只是想和他谈谈
He just wants
a little conversation.

9
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,881
但这家伙，根本不理不睬
But this guy.
He don't wanna hear about it.

10
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:29,852
他可能会听你的话
Maybe he'll listen to you.

11
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:33,914
他每星期二都会到这儿来
你星期二有空吗？
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

12
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,951
是的，我星期二有空
Yeah. I'm free Tuesday.

13
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,804
很高兴再次见到您，琼斯先生
Nice to see you again.
Mr. Jones.

14
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:12,887
记住，做的干净点
Remember. Neatness counts.

15
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:15,330
你有一个半小时
You got one half hour.

16
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,241
一个小时吧
One hour.

17
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,744
什么事？
What?

18
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:42,953
我是唐托，楼下的
有个家伙想跟你谈谈
It's Tonto. Downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

19
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,260
他看起来咋样？
What's he look like?

20
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,960
很危险
Serious.

21
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:54,027
- 告诉他我这就过去
- 他正在去你那儿
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

22
00:03:56,274 --> 00:04:00,210
有人上来了，很危险
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

23
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:07,980
米奇，眼睛瞪大点，有客人来了
Mickey. Open your eyes.
We got company.

24
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,252
有客人来了
We got company.

25
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,168
来啊
Come on.

26
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,310
住手，哥们！
Stop. Man!

27
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,510
是唐托

28
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:49,926
告诉司机到门口等着，快！
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back. And hurry up.

29
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,101
- 亲爱的，出什么事了？
- 别担心，宝贝
- Sweetie. What's going on?
- Don't worry. Baby.

30
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:42,237
冷静点，睡一小会儿吧
It's cool. Take a nap.

31
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:02,956
哦，我的天啊
Oh. My God.

32
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,161
那些傻瓜封锁了所有出口
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

33
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,705
到天台看看！
Check the terrace!

34
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:27,079
- 911紧急救援
- 救命啊
<i>- 911 emergency.
- I need help.</i>

35
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:29,483
- 有人要杀我
- 别挂啊
<i>- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Just stay on the line.</i>

36
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,216
稍等一下
<i>I'll just be off a moment.</i>

37
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,656
我给你转一位警官
<i>I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.</i>

38
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:56,213
我是探员杰斐逊
有什么可以帮忙的吗？
<i>DetectiveJefferson.
May I help you?</i>

39
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,248
我过会儿再打吧
I'll call you back.

40
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,518
别冲动，哥们，我那些箱子里
有半个玻利维亚的毒品
Relax. Man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

41
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:10,391
甚至都没开封，去拿走吧，送你了
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead. Take it. It's yours.

42
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,224
拨这电话号码
Dial this number.

43
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,107
以后再联络，亲爱的，好吗？
I'll talk to you later.
Sweetie. Okay?

44
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,185
拜拜
Bye.

45
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:42,856
- 喂？
- 我是莫瑞齐奥，还记得我吗？
<i>- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?</i>

46
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:47,555
- 我看见你回来了
- 是啊，我是说，没有
<i>- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean. No.</i>

47
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:49,566
今天刚回来
Just for today.

48
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,432
那么可以肯定的说
今天是你在这儿的最后一天了…
<i>So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...</i>

49
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:55,301
我们不会再看见你他妈的那张肥脸了吧
<i>and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.</i>

50
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:57,864
是的，说的没错
Yeah. Right.

51
00:08:58,076 --> 00:09:00,704
让我跟中间人通话吧
<i>Let me speak
to our mutual friend.</i>

52
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:04,774
他要跟你通话
He wants to talk to you.

53
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:14,315
保证他确实明白了，然后放他走吧
<i>Make sure he understands.
And let him go.</i>

54
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:26,603
你能明白吗？
Do you understand?

55
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,367
- 那就说出来
- 我明白了
- So say it.
- I understand.

56
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,740
很好
Good.

57
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,360
上帝啊
Jesus.

58
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:11,772
“朋友，跟往常一样，两瓶牛奶？”

59
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:12,866
Two milk as usual?

60
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,516
为何要把香烟藏起来？
Why did you hide the cigarette?

61
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,384
这大厦的人太多事了
This building's full of rats.

62
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,691
我不想我爸知道，麻烦够多了
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

63
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:43,037
出什么事了？
What happened?

64
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,735
我骑自行车摔了
I fell off my bike.

65
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:03,316
别告发我抽烟的事，好吗？
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette. Okay?

66
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:18,272
- 为什么你要这样对待我们？
- 我不知道…
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know...

67
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:21,573
现如今人们记性都不好了
肯定是阳光的问题
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

68
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,910
- 知道什么时候由阳光产生吗
- 我不知道怎么弄的
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

69
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:26,006
我是干啥的？我只是一个保管员
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

70
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,950
我保管你给我的东西，我不看也不碰
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

71
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:31,045
- 我不知道怎样分离
- 听我说
- I don't know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me.

72
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,780
六月份给你的时候百分之百纯度
In June. We gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

73
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:37,521
现在是七月份，我们来拿
纯度变成了百分之九十
Now it's July. We pick up the dope.
And it tests 90 percent pure.

74
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:41,031
六月和七月之间少了百分之十
Somewhere between June and July.
Ten percent turned to cut!

75
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:44,465
我不知道，这不关我事
你给我这些东西我就保管
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff. I hold it.

76
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:47,936
- 我就知道这些
- 我在想法帮你…
- That's all I know.
- I'm trying to help you out here...

77
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,735
但你要真那么肯定…
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

78
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:53,107
我就要去问他了
I gotta disturb him.

79
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:58,544
当他沉浸在音乐里时
他非常痛恨被打扰
When he's into his music.
He hates being disturbed.

80
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,811
我说的是真话
I'm telling you the truth.

81
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:05,117
我希望如此，因为他有天赋辨别谎言
I hope so. Because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

82
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,018
那很吓人的
It's scary.

83
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,322
几乎就像是第六感
It's almost like a sixth sense.

84
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:14,125
是你改主意还是我去打扰他？
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

85
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,832
我说的是事实
I'm telling you the truth.

86
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,841
好吧
All right.

87
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:32,104
斯丹
Stan.

88
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:39,145
对不起，他说他没有做过手脚
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

89
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,658
他当然没有
Of course he didn't.

90
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:33,773
帮个忙
Just do me a favor.

91
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,574
明天之前查出来是谁干的
Find out who did by tomorrow.

92
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:38,512
中午之前
Noon.

93
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,656
马奇，等等
Malky. Wait.

94
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,722
我真没做手脚
I didn't cut your shit.

95
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,166
你自己去查吧！
Find out yourself!

96
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:04,674
你在外面干什么？回家做作业去
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

97
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,438
- 我已经做完了
- 回家帮你姐姐…
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

98
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:08,944
打扫这该死的房子！
clean up the goddamn house!

99
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,072
不许再抽烟了！
And stop smoking cigarettes!

100
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:02,018
一
<i>One!</i>

101
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,620
二，深吸一口气
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

102
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:07,721
深呼一口气
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

103
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:11,859
- 做深呼吸，吸气
- 时间到了，该我了
<i>- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.</i>

104
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:14,700
要调台我就痛扁你
Change the channel.
And I'll smash your face.

105
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:17,104
腿准备，下
<i>Ready for the legs.
And down.</i>

106
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,877
对不起，宝贝
Sorry. Sweetheart.

107
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:32,820
收紧，放开
<i>Squeeze. Release.</i>

108
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,085
早上好
Good morning.

109
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:37,218
嗨，宝贝
Hi. Honey.

110
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:42,796
宝贝，小点声，妈妈头疼
Sweetheart. Turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

111
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:46,063
- 她霸占了我的时间
- 她想看该死的卡通片！
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

112
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:48,071
动动屁股不会受伤的
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

113
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:50,096
在这儿有大屁股的不是我
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

114
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:52,404
两下，然后起来
<i>Two and up.</i>

115
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,976
整天除了看卡通片啥也不做的某人…
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

116
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,707
去买点吃的回来好吗？
move a little ass
and go get some food?

117
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:02,184
- 腿，漂亮
- 我看你再敢那么说
<i>- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.</i>

118
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,723
- 玛吉，我想我有麻烦了
- 这又不是第一次
- Margie. I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

119
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:14,128
你总是能弄出点事来，是不是？
You always come up
with somethin'. Right?

120
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,428
但这次可能有点过分了
I think I went too far this time.

121
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:20,001
你现在是有点过分，我上班要迟到了
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

122
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,436
今天不上班在家待着咋样？
How about workin'
at home today?

123
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:28,267
仔细体会下，就是这样，在腹部
<i>Really feel it.
That's it. Stomach in.</i>

124
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:32,008
- 一…
- 现在该我了！
<i>- One...
- Now it's my turn!</i>

125
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:34,710
靠！她要打我！
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

126
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:37,151
- 爸，她…
- 靠！把那该死的门关上！
- Daddy. She's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

127
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:40,417
不要开枪！
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

128
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:44,851
他妈的贱货
Fuckin' bitch.

129
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:49,763
- 威震天！
- 身体要稳
<i>- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

130
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:53,860
当你使用夸卓拉步法的时候
你的大腿肌肉…
<i>When you use the Quadra-Step.
Your thigh muscles...</i>

131
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:56,929
- 谁快去接电话啊？
- 我在忙呢！
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

132
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,905
- 喂？
- 我是玛格丽特・梅考勒斯特…
<i>- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...</i>

133
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:10,386
新泽西威尔伍德斯宾塞中学的校长
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood. NewJersey.</i>

134
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:13,184
兰度先生或太太在家吗？
<i>Is Mr. Or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

135
00:19:16,126 --> 00:19:18,151
我就是兰度太太
This is she.

136
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:21,493
兰度太太，您丈夫在斯宾塞
给玛蒂尔达注册的时候…
<i>Mrs. Lando. When your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...</i>

137
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,929
他告诉我们她有点“问题”
<i>he told us she had "Problems."</i>

138
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,492
我们很乐意教导有问题的小女孩
如您所见，我们很乐意把问题小女孩…
<i>As you know. We pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...</i>

139
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:28,797
变成健康，有益的年轻女性
<i>into healthy.
Productive young women.</i>

140
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:31,807
但如果她们人不在这儿
那我们能做的就很有限了
<i>But if they are not here.
There is very little we can do.</i>

141
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:35,073
玛蒂尔达已旷课两个星期
<i>Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

142
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:38,080
我知道您丈夫已预交了一年学费…
<i>I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...</i>

143
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:42,209
但如果您查看我们送给您的校规…
<i>but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...</i>

144
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:46,222
您会发现，除非有正当理由
可以长期缺席…
<i>you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...</i>

145
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,225
否则您的学费将被没收
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

146
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,887
她已经死了
She's dead.

147
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:15,841
让那倒霉孩子干点家务活！
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

148
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,117
清理干净！我受不了他妈的脏东西
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

149
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,555
赶紧的！
Hurry up!

150
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:37,233
$ <i>Why am I feeling</i>
<i>Why am I feeling</i>

151
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,242
$ <i>When things could look black</i>
<i>When things could look black</i>

152
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:43,542
$ <i>That nothing could possibly go wrong</i>
<i>That nothing
could possibly go wrong</i>

153
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:49,583
$ <i>This has been a most unusual day</i>
<i>This has been
a most unusual day</i>

154
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,948
$ <i>Love has made me see things</i>
<i>Love has made me see things</i>

155
00:20:54,024 --> 00:20:59,894
$ <i>In a different way</i>
<i>In a different way</i>

156
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:31,589
生活总是这么难
还是因为你仅仅是个孩子？
Is life always this hard.
Or is it just when you're a kid?

157
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:37,066
一直这样的
Always like this.

158
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,206
留着吧
Keep it.

159
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:57,151
我要去杂货店买东西，你要点牛奶吗？
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

160
00:21:57,187 --> 00:22:00,156
一夸脱还是两夸脱？是两夸脱吧？
<i>One quart or two?
It's two. Right?</i>

161
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:47,559
我喜欢暴风雨之前短暂的平静
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

162
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,229
这让我想起贝多芬
It reminds me of Beethoven.

163
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:59,701
你能听到吗？
Can you hear it?

164
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:03,644
就好像你把头贴在草地上
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

165
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:06,046
你能听见它的生长
you can hear it growin'.

166
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:08,744
你能听到那些昆虫
You can hear the insects.

167
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,427
- 你喜欢贝多芬吗？
- 说实在的，不喜欢
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

168
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:19,485
我给你演奏点吧
I'm gonna play you some.

169
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,798
爸爸！
Daddy!

170
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,348
你最好待在这儿
You better stay here.

171
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,091
我们说了是中午
We said noon.

172
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,496
已经过了一分钟了
I've got one minute past.

173
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:33,528
你不喜欢贝多芬
You don't like Beethoven.

174
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:37,070
你不知道自己错过了什么
You don't know
what you're missing.

175
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,543
序曲让我浑身舒畅
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

176
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:44,273
那么的有力量
So powerful.

177
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:48,477
但开场之后，说实在的…
But after his openings.
To be honest...

178
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:52,613
他就开始有点他妈的乏味了
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

179
00:25:54,758 --> 00:25:56,885
这就是为什么我不停下来！
That's why I stopped!

180
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,562
四处搜搜
Toss the apartment.

181
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:28,121
你喜欢莫扎特，我也喜欢
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

182
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:31,183
我很喜欢莫扎特
I love Mozart!

183
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,665
你知道他是奥地利人
He was Austrian. You know.

184
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:42,535
但对于这样的场合
他就有点太轻柔了
But for this kind of work.
He's a little bit light.

185
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:45,598
所以我要找点带劲儿的家伙
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

186
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:49,338
- 真不错
- 爷们，你他妈的在干吗？
- Cool.
- Dude. What the fuck are you doing?

187
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:52,210
哥们，闭上你的鸟嘴
<i>Man.
Keep your bombacut mouth shut.</i>

188
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:56,150
试试勃拉姆斯，他也不错
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

189
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:58,687
- 你对音乐知道多少？
- 哥们，别这样！
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man. Knock it off!

190
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,437
- 你检查过床垫了吗？
- 没有
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

191
00:27:58,415 --> 00:27:59,780
哇喔
Wow.

192
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:22,367
哦，妈的！
Oh! Fuck!

193
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,703
他死了
He's dead.

194
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:29,006
上帝啊，看看你做了什么
Jesus. Look what you did.

195
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:31,009
斯丹，你没事吧？
Stan. You all right?

196
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,468
你在干什么？
What are you doin'?

197
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:57,597
- 他已经死了！
- 但是他毁了我的西服
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

198
00:28:57,674 --> 00:29:00,074
是的，我知道，但他已经死了
Yeah. I know.
But he's dead.

199
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,609
他现在就是一堆肉，算了吧，冷静点
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

200
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,272
我很冷静
I'm calm.

201
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,543
待在这儿，好吗？
Stay there. All right?

202
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,380
班尼！
Benny!

203
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:21,052
真他妈该死，班尼！
我们是马奇和斯丹！
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

204
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:24,792
别紧张，好吗？
Take it easy. All right?

205
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,699
来吧
Come on.

206
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,999
班尼！

207
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,508
来吧，我们抽根烟
Come on.
Let's get a cigarette.

208
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:34,975
班尼，我们要出来了！
Benny. We're comin' out!

209
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,878
班尼，别开枪！
Benny. Don't fire!

210
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:40,745
到里面去！
Get in there!

211
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:43,308
真他妈该死，班尼！
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!

212
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:46,913
你穿了新衣服然后…来个火？
You wear somethin' new and...
Got a light?

213
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,958
放松点
Take it easy.

214
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,090
外面发生什么事了？
What's happening out there?

215
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:54,028
没事，夫人，禁毒署的
It's all right. Ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

216
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:57,430
放过这可怜的一家吧
Leave that poor family alone.

217
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,992
- 一切都正常，冷静点
- 我很冷静，我很冷静
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

218
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:03,437
你们为什么不放过他们？
Why don't you
leave them alone?

219
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:07,834
他说了，回家去！
He said go back inside.

220
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:15,482
斯丹，我们还是进去吧
Stan. I think it's better
if we go inside.

221
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:38,463
班尼，把厨房翻个底朝天！
给我找出来！
Benny. Turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

222
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:42,068
威利・布拉德，看看你做了什么！
你杀了一个四岁的小孩儿！
Willy Blood. Iook what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

223
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:44,079
你真得必须这样做吗？
Did you really
have to do that?

224
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,659
求求你开门吧
Please open the door.

225
00:31:58,788 --> 00:32:02,224
班尼，应该有三个孩子
Benny.
There are three kids here.

226
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:04,726
我想斯丹杀的是这个女孩
I think Stan killed this girl.

227
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:07,262
威利，那个混蛋，杀了那个小男孩
Willy. That asshole.
Shot the little boy.

228
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:09,932
第三个不见了，把她找出来
The third one's missing.
Find her.

229
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:21,838
靠，这个小女孩漏网了
Shit. We missed
the little girl. Man.

230
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:25,574
我去找这该死的大楼管理员
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

231
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,273
- 你认识我吗？
- 我，钢索，认识你！
<i>- Don't you recognize me?
- Me. Grimlock. Know you!</i>

232
00:33:06,523 --> 00:33:07,888
靠
Shit.

233
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:13,151
- 呀，我找到了！
- 好！
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

234
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:16,289
- 他们找到了
- 我知道
- They found it.
- I know.

235
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,330
这就是
There it is.

236
00:33:19,536 --> 00:33:21,333
警察来了，我们最好离开
There's cops outside.
We better go.

237
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:24,905
警察来了，我们快走吧，你留下
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

238
00:33:26,976 --> 00:33:28,534
我怎么说？
What do I say?

239
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,317
告诉他们…
Tell them...

240
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,791
我们在执行公务
we were doing our job.

241
00:33:56,372 --> 00:34:00,331
- 你叫什么名字？
- 玛蒂尔达
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

242
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:08,609
- 你父亲的事我很难过
- 就算今天他们不杀他…
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

243
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:11,677
早晚我也会动手的
one day or another.
I would have probably done it myself.

244
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:15,088
你妈妈，她…
Your mother. She...

245
00:34:15,158 --> 00:34:16,955
她不是我妈妈
She's not my mother.

246
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:22,623
我姐姐想要减肥，她就那样了
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

247
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,600
她也不是我亲姐，只是同父异母罢了
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

248
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,966
那半血统也不怎么好
Not a good half at that.

249
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:40,249
既然你无法忍受他们
那你为什么要哭？
If you couldn't stand them.
Why are you crying?

250
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:43,252
我们杀了我弟弟
They killed my brother.

251
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:47,688
他到底做了什么？他只有四岁
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

252
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:49,691
他从不爱哭
He never used to cry.

253
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:53,752
他只喜欢坐在我旁边抱着我
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

254
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,767
我对他比那该死的猪更像妈妈
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

255
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:03,135
不要那样说猪，他们通常比人要友善
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

256
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:05,401
但它们臭得要命
But they smell like shit.

257
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,867
不一定
Not true.

258
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:13,405
事实上，我厨房里现在就有一头…
As a matter of fact.
Right now I have one in my kitchen...

259
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,413
很干净的…
that's very clean...

260
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:19,748
- 而且闻起来很好
- 你厨房里没有猪
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

261
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:23,156
有的
Yes. I do.

262
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:26,354
我刚才在那儿，没看见什么该死的猪
I was just in there.
And I didn't see any goddamned pig.

263
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:29,956
不要动，我去找它
Don't move.
I'll get him.

264
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:33,868
猪仔，你在哪儿？
Piggy. Where are you?

265
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,339
啊，你在这儿
There you are.

266
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,349
嗨，玛蒂尔达
Hi. Mathilda.

267
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:50,113
嗨，猪仔
Hi. Piggy.

268
00:35:57,694 --> 00:36:00,857
你今天过得好吗？
How are you today?

269
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,398
不算太好
I've seen better days.

270
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:15,341
- 你叫什么名字？
- 利昂
- What's your name?
- Leon.

271
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:19,906
可爱的名字
Cute name.

272
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:30,985
你有什么人或者地方可投靠吗？
You have anyone to go to.
Any family anyplace else?

273
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:44,471
我要再来点牛奶
I'm gonna get some more milk.

274
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,557
我靠
Holy shit.

275
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,567
请不要碰
Don't touch that. Please.

276
00:37:14,771 --> 00:37:17,103
你靠什么为生的？
What do you do for a living?

277
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:19,573
清洁工
Cleaner.

278
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,011
你是一个杀手？
You're a hit man?

279
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:28,106
酷
Cool.

280
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:45,158
- 你什么人都杀吗？
- 不杀女人和小孩，那是规矩
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women. No kids. That's the rules.

281
00:37:45,234 --> 00:37:48,260
雇人去收拾那些混蛋要多少钱？
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

282
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:51,170
那些杀了我弟弟的混蛋？
who killed my brother?

283
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,040
- 一人五千
- 哇
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

284
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:59,172
我为你工作怎么样…
How about I work for you...

285
00:37:59,248 --> 00:38:02,809
作为交换，你教我怎么杀人？
and in exchange.
You teach me how to clean?

286
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:05,945
你觉得行不？
What do you think?

287
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,047
我会给你打扫，我会帮你购物
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

288
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:10,319
我会给你洗衣服
I'll even wash your clothes.

289
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:15,964
- 同意吗？
- 不，我不同意
- Is it a deal?
- No. It's not a deal.

290
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:28,275
那你让我怎么办？我没有地方可去了
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

291
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:32,178
你今天已受够了
You've had a rough day today.

292
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:37,551
去睡一觉，明天再说
Go to sleep.
And we'll see tomorrow.

293
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:55,195
你对我真好，利昂…
You've been really great
with me. Leon...

294
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:58,297
不会总这样的
and it's not always like that.

295
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,239
你知道吗？
You know?

296
00:39:08,017 --> 00:39:09,382
晚安
Good night.

297
00:40:25,695 --> 00:40:28,095
睡得好吗？
You sleep well?

298
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,428
很好
Good.

299
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:32,991
- 早饭后你就离开吧
- 去哪儿？
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

300
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:35,594
与我无关
Not my problem.

301
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:51,451
读一下
Read it.

302
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,386
你不认字
You don't know how to read.

303
00:41:00,463 --> 00:41:03,432
我正在学，但我近来很忙…
I'm learning. But I've had
a lot of work lately...

304
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:06,559
所以有点退步了
so I'm a little behind.

305
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,159
上面写的什么？
What's it say?

306
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:12,264
我已经决定今后要做什么了
我要当杀手
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

307
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:16,744
你要做杀手，给
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

308
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:21,613
拿去，这是一个送别礼物
去做吧，但别跟着我
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean. But not with me.

309
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,313
- 我独来独往，明白吗？
- 邦妮和克莱德从不单独行动
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

310
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:28,380
希尔玛和露易丝也从不单独行动
他们是最好的
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

311
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:34,622
玛蒂尔达，你为什么要这样对我？
Mathilda. Why are you
doing this to me?

312
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:37,393
我不图回报的对你好
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

313
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:40,367
昨天我救了你一命，就在门口
I saved your life yesterday.
Right outside the door.

314
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:43,634
对，所以你现在要为之负责了
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

315
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:47,199
你肯救我一定是有原因的
If you saved my life.
You must've saved it for a good reason.

316
00:41:47,276 --> 00:41:50,074
如果你现在丢下我不管
这就跟你昨天没开门是一样的…
If you throw me out now.
It's like you never opened your door...

317
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:52,842
就像你让我在那儿死掉一样
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

318
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:58,385
但是你开门了，所以…
But you did open it. So...

319
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:06,084
如果你不帮我，我今晚就会死掉
我能感觉的到
If you don't help me.
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

320
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,357
我不想今晚就死
I don't wanna die tonight.

321
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,358
玛蒂尔达，你只是一个小女孩
You're just a little girl.

322
00:42:13,436 --> 00:42:16,405
不要这么悲观，但我觉得你做不了
Don't take it badly.
But I don't think you could do it.

323
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:17,804
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

324
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:38,560
怎么样？
How's that?

325
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:15,555
不许再这么做，否则我打爆你脑袋
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

326
00:43:15,631 --> 00:43:17,155
明白吗？
You got that?

327
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:21,734
我不会那样做的，那不专业
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

328
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,738
那是规矩
There is rules.

329
00:43:24,773 --> 00:43:27,606
不要总说“好的”！
And stop saying "okay"
all the time!

330
00:43:30,646 --> 00:43:32,307
好的
Good.

331
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,725
你打算在这酒店里用那个吗？
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

332
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,760
先生，我必须用它…
Mister. I have to use it...

333
00:43:54,803 --> 00:43:58,899
因为我下个月要在朱利亚德试演…
because I have an audition
atJuilliard next month...

334
00:43:58,974 --> 00:44:01,306
所以我必须练习
and I have to practice.

335
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:05,279
好吧，但不能超过十点
Okay. But not after 10:00.

336
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,372
- 我保证
- 好吧
- I promise.
- All right.

337
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:12,354
我会把你们安排在最里头的房间…
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

338
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:16,482
那样你们不会打扰别人
so that you
dongt disturb anyone.

339
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:17,958
请填表
Fill those out. Please.

340
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:27,292
爸爸，能让我填吗？
我一向喜欢填酒店表格的
Daddy. Can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

341
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:32,900
谢谢，爸，我马上拿回来
Thanks. Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

342
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:35,341
四楼！
Fourth floor!

343
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,901
谢谢，先生！
Thanks. Mister!

344
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:40,210
你很走运，有这么一个
生气勃勃的小女孩
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

345
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:45,919
我有个小孩，十七岁了
整日啥也不干
I have a kid. 17.
Does nothing all day long.

346
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:54,654
我把行李拿上楼的时候
先把盆栽放在这儿好吗？
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

347
00:44:54,697 --> 00:44:56,528
当然可以
Of course.

348
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:20,683
我填的是班里一个
让我讨厌的同学的名字
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

349
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:26,761
如果出事了，就让她去处理
If things get hot.
She'll take the heat.

350
00:45:43,746 --> 00:45:46,442
给，填好了
There. Finished.

351
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:49,907
- 你多大啦？
- 十八
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

352
00:45:50,753 --> 00:45:53,745
- 十八？
- 想看我的出生证明吗？
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

353
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:59,022
不用，你只是看上去很年轻
No. You just look a little young.

354
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,557
谢谢
Thanks.

355
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:12,366
利昂，我希望你让我
成为跟你一样的人
Leon. I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

356
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:14,636
我想要像你一样强壮和聪明
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

357
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:19,311
我知道我还不够强壮…
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

358
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:23,408
但我可以从基本理论学起
but I could learn the basics.
The theory.

359
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:27,615
你觉得怎样？仅仅是理论
What do you think?
Just the theory.

360
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,886
我需要这样，利昂
I need this. Leon.

361
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,753
我需要时间来整理思路
I need time to get my head together.

362
00:46:33,796 --> 00:46:36,629
是的，我需要…
Yeah. And I need...

363
00:46:42,404 --> 00:46:43,837
来一杯
a drink.

364
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:46,898
别动，我去
Dongt move.
I'll go get one.

365
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,492
当你告诉我你要这种婴儿玩具…
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

366
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,801
我还以为我听力有问题
I thought my hearing was going.

367
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:22,776
我对自己说，“利昂是一个专家
除了菜鸟没人用那个”
I says to myself. " Leongs a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

368
00:47:22,845 --> 00:47:24,642
我想保持状态
I like to stay in shape.

369
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,083
好，总保持领先
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

370
00:47:29,151 --> 00:47:32,882
这就像我，我必须掌握所有情况
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

371
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,583
我稳稳的坐在这儿而不是东躲西藏
I never leave this place.
Except to go from here to there.

372
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,919
改变不怎么好，利昂，你知道吗？
Change aingt good. Leon.
You know?

373
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,399
检查一下吧
Check it.

374
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:58,607
- 看看是否你要的
- 我相信你
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

375
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,672
相信别人容易出事，记住了
One thing's got nothing to do
with the other. Remember that.

376
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:04,985
我会的
I will.

377
00:48:20,035 --> 00:48:23,004
步枪是你学习使用的第一件武器…
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

378
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:26,905
因为它让你跟目标保持距离
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

379
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:29,170
你越专业…
The closer you get
to being a pro...

380
00:48:29,244 --> 00:48:32,543
你就离目标越近
the closer you can get
to the client.

381
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:36,050
例如刀之类的武器，是你最后要学的
The knife. For example.
Is the last thing you learn.

382
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,155
就位
Position.

383
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:11,146
不到最后一刻不要打开，它会反光的
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

384
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,053
他们会在一英里外就看到你
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

385
00:49:14,122 --> 00:49:17,888
要穿深色衣服
And always dress down.

386
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,054
不能比地面显眼，明白吗？
Never brighter
than the floor. Okay?

387
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:28,630
我们现在开始练习吧
这是学习的最佳方法
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

388
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:30,763
我应该打哪儿？
Who should I hit?

389
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,500
随便
Whoever.

390
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:41,647
等下就来，等我几分钟，谢谢
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

391
00:49:41,717 --> 00:49:44,515
你们这些家伙给我消失
我不想看见你们
You guys get lost.
I dongt want to see you.

392
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:47,953
- 人人就位了吗？
- 这看起来自然多了
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

393
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,966
- 不杀女人，不杀小孩，对吧？
- 对
- No women. No kids. Right?
- Right.

394
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,678
那个穿黄橙相间的慢跑的？
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

395
00:50:15,183 --> 00:50:17,674
保持冷静
Keep calm.

396
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:24,347
视线不要离开目标
Dongt take your eyes off him.

397
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:26,254
轻呼吸
Breathe easy.

398
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:29,724
观察他的动作
Watch his movement.

399
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,691
假装自己正在和他一起跑
Pretend you're running with him.

400
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,833
试着感觉他下一个动作
Try to feel his next movement.

401
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:45,780
深呼吸，保持住
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

402
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:55,814
动手
Now.

403
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:57,722
哦，我的天啊！
Oh. My God!

404
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:01,354
- 我没事，我很好
- 趴下！哪里来的？
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

405
00:51:01,597 --> 00:51:05,226
一枪中的，不错吧？
One shot. Not bad. Huh?

406
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,825
- 到底谁开的枪？
- 我喘不过来气了，闪一边去
- Who the hell fired?
- I just cangt breathe! Get off me.

407
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,600
我们现在能试试实弹吗？
Can we try
with real bullets now?

408
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:13,641
今天不行，收工
Not today.
Let's pack up.

409
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:24,316
就像这样
Like that.

410
00:52:06,828 --> 00:52:10,093
- 不，谢了
- 没的商量
- No. Thanks.
- No discussion.

411
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:53,841
“看起来…
"It seemed...

412
00:52:55,177 --> 00:52:57,145
就像苏格拉底…”
to Socrates..."

413
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,920
让我来吧
I'll do it.

414
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:23,336
利昂，我们不停的工作
Leon. All we do is work.

415
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:26,499
我们需要休息，我们做游戏吧
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

416
00:53:26,742 --> 00:53:30,303
- 什么样的游戏？
- 我知道一个很棒的游戏
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

417
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:34,212
它有助思考和记忆，正是你需要的
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

418
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:49,190
$ <i>Like a virgin</i>
<i>Like a virgin</i>

<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

420
00:53:58,907 --> 00:54:01,933

- 我不知道
- Who is it?
- I dongt know.

421
00:54:12,087 --> 00:54:17,923

I dongt know.

424
00:54:33,475 --> 00:54:35,340
小胡子

好
Good.

429
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:54,160
该你了
Your turn now.

430
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:01,398
好了，旅行者
Okay. Pilgrim.

431
00:55:04,906 --> 00:55:06,305
克林特・伊斯特伍德
Clint Eastwood?

432
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:18,278
- 我不知道，我弃权
- 约翰・韦恩
- I dongt know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

433
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:22,312
我刚要说的，我发誓，这让人吃惊
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

434
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:24,858
利昂，真的很棒
Leon. Really brilliant.

435
00:55:27,195 --> 00:55:29,163
不可思议
Amazing.

436
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,311
- 你很喜欢那盆栽，是不是？
- 它是我最好的朋友
- You love your plant. Dongt you?
- It's my best friend.

437
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:52,012
总是快乐，从不提问
<i>Always happy.
No questions.</i>

438
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:56,581
它就像我一样，你看
It's like me. You see.

439
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:58,956
没有根
No roots.

440
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:02,656
如果你真爱它，你应该把它
种到公园里，那它就会有根了
If you really love it. You should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

441
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:09,427
你应该来浇灌我
如果你想让我长大的话
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

442
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,164
你说的对
You're right.

443
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:26,042
不要！
Wait!

444
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:45,399
它们就像要从餐具里跳出来
它们好像活了一样

445
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:45,857
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

446
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:55,949
好久不见了，利昂
It's been a long time. Leon.

447
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:03,691
我常想你
I missed you.

448
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:08,593
- 而且你错过了很多好活儿
- 我在培训
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

449
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:12,656
培训是好事，但不要做过头了
Training's good.
But dongt overdo it.

450
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:15,225
培训跟干活的收益不能相提并论，利昂
Training dongt pay
as good as working. Leon.

451
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,669
托尼…
Tony...

452
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:24,271
我挣的所有的钱，放在你那儿的…
all the money I make.
That you keep for me...

453
00:57:24,346 --> 00:57:26,337
你需要钱吗？
You need some money?

454
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:28,041
随便问问
Just curious.

455
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:30,050
我干活干了很久了…
I've been working
a long time...

456
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:33,679
却从没用钱做过什么事
and I havengt done anything
with my money.

457
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:41,592
我想可能有一天要用
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

458
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:44,131
你有女人了
You met a woman.

459
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,700
利昂，你要小心女人
You gotta be careful
with women.

460
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:58,746
还记得你来这个国家的时候吗？
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

461
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:03,307
当我把你领上道时，你乳臭未干…
When I took you in. You were still wet
behind the fucking ears...

462
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:06,320
就是因为一个女人搞的一团糟
and. Already. You were in deep shit
because of a woman.

463
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:11,291
- 不要忘了，利昂
- 我希望我能忘了
- Dongt forget that. Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

464
00:58:13,795 --> 00:58:16,195
你知道，关于我的钱…
You know. About my money...

465
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:20,598
或许我可以送…
Maybe I could give...

466
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:22,727
一点儿…
a little...

467
00:58:24,339 --> 00:58:26,603
给某人
to someone.

468
00:58:26,674 --> 00:58:29,734
你知道，帮人救急
You know. To help out.

469
00:58:32,347 --> 00:58:36,374
这是你的钱，我只是帮你保管
就像银行一样
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you. Like a bank.

470
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:40,751
甚至比银行更好
因为银行经常会倒闭的
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

471
00:58:40,822 --> 00:58:43,256
老托尼这儿不会倒闭
No one knocks off old Tony.

472
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:45,758
而且，去银行…
Besides. With a bank...

473
00:58:45,827 --> 00:58:49,194
要填很多表格
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

474
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:54,327
但在老托尼这儿，什么也不用看
什么也不用填，都在脑子里
But old Tony. Nothing to read.
Nothing to write. It's all in his head.

475
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:58,868
我现在识字了
I know how to read now.

476
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:02,201
不错，利昂
That's good. Leon.

477
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,636
你的钱在这儿
Your money's here.

478
00:59:06,714 --> 00:59:09,444
无论何时你要取，你就来找我
Whenever you want it.
You just ask me.

479
00:59:09,517 --> 00:59:13,544
- 这是一千块，拿着吧
- 没事，我用不着
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I dongt need it.

480
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:18,183
- 拿走吧，找点乐子，去吧
- 谢谢
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

481
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:22,161
好了，现在我们谈谈生意吧
All right.
Now let's talk business.

482
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,666
不要走，我去拿资料
Dongt move.
I'll go get the file.

483
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:29,794
麦诺劳，给我朋友利昂来杯牛奶
Manolo. A glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

484
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:55,560
听着，玛蒂尔达，你要小心点
Listen. Mathilda.
You better be careful.

485
00:59:55,597 --> 00:59:58,259
你不能随便跟街上的人讲话
You cangt just speak
to any guy off the street.

486
00:59:59,467 --> 01:00:02,265
利昂，放心吧，这有他妈的什么啊？
Leon. Get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

487
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:05,135
我只是在等待的时候找根烟抽
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

488
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:09,140
我不许你说粗话
I want you to stop cursing.

489
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,405
你不能总是这样跟人讲话的
You cangt talk to people
like that all the time.

490
01:00:11,479 --> 01:00:14,573
我希望你讲话文明点
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

491
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:22,551
而且我不许你再抽烟，那会要你命的
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

492
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,858
离他远一点，他看起来好像有毛病
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

493
01:00:36,938 --> 01:00:40,738
我过五分钟就出来
待在我能看见你的地方
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

494
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:58,419
利昂，我想我已经爱上你了
Leon. I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

495
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:04,331
这是我的初恋，你知道吗
It's the first time for me.
You know.

496
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:07,664
你怎么知道那就是爱情
如果你以前从没有爱过的话
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

497
01:01:07,735 --> 01:01:10,636
因为我能感觉的到
'Cause I feel it.

498
01:01:10,672 --> 01:01:12,333
哪儿？
Where?

499
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:17,811
在我的胃里面
In my stomach.

500
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:24,276
很温暖
It's all warm.

501
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:29,517
我以前总感觉胃里打结，现在消失了
I always had a knot there.
And now it's gone.

502
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:37,693
玛蒂尔达，我很高兴你胃病好了
Mathilda. I'm glad you
dongt have a stomachache anymore.

503
01:01:37,732 --> 01:01:40,292
我不觉得那有什么意义
I dongt think
it means anything.

504
01:01:40,368 --> 01:01:44,236
我干活要迟到了，我干活不喜欢迟到
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

505
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,574
嘿，练的怎么样了？
How's the practicing going?

506
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:05,645
- 今天怎么样，小姐？
- 有点不想练了
- How are we today. Miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

507
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,654
我能理解
I understand.

508
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:09,656
但你做的不错
But you're doing all right.

509
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,715
我没听到有人抱怨
I havengt received
any complaints.

510
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:15,991
我用布把发声部包了起来以降低噪音
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

511
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,723
真聪明
That's very smart.

512
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,464
- 不是人人都爱音乐的
- 我知道
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

513
01:03:23,538 --> 01:03:25,631
你父亲究竟是干那一行的？
What does your father do?

514
01:03:27,008 --> 01:03:31,536
- 他是一个作曲家
- 太棒了
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

515
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,080
可惜他不真的是我父亲
Except he's not really my father.

516
01:03:39,721 --> 01:03:41,484
他是我的爱人
He's my lover.

517
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,825
我要出去散散步
Think I'll go for a walk.

518
01:04:03,611 --> 01:04:07,103
- 你周六晚上有事吗？
- 一起吃晚饭好吗？
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

519
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:10,412

就在这儿见？

If you'll just take us step-by-step

526
01:05:50,485 --> 01:05:53,181
那家伙在这儿，他要去拿枪
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

527
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:55,586
砰，我们向他开枪…
Bang. We shot him.

528
01:05:58,826 --> 01:06:01,795
- 那些孩子在哪儿？
- 我不知道！
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I dongt know!

529
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:04,229
他们应该在学校，你不认为吗？
They should have been at school.
Dongt you think?

530
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:06,266
你的陈述说你是第一个进屋的
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

531
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:08,492
- 你没看到孩子吗？
- 门被打破了
- Didngt you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

532
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:10,594
发生了什么？你按程序来的吗？
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

533
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:16,165
在这儿我损失了一个好手
你他妈的想让我怎么办？
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

534
01:06:16,244 --> 01:06:18,769
合作
Cooperation.

535
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:26,051
我没有时间和你们胡扯
I havengt got time

536
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,784
你想要合作？来我办公室，4602房间
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office. Room 4602.

537
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:43,962
小孩应该在学校

538
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:47,800
拜托，那是我的球！
Come on. That's my ball!

539
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:52,278
还给我，你要去哪儿？
Give that back.
Where you going?

540
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:55,873
该死！你要去哪儿，哥们？
那是我的球！
Damn! Where you going. Man?

541
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,624
跟着那辆蓝色轿车
Follow the blue car.

542
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:07,820
你是要我鸣着警笛闯红灯吗？
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

543
01:07:07,895 --> 01:07:09,328
不是，慢慢开吧
No. Drive slowly.

544
01:07:09,564 --> 01:07:12,226
拿着这一百块，闭上他妈的嘴
Take the hundred bucks.
And shut the fuck up.

545
01:07:44,649 --> 01:07:48,085
<i>I do not want to fight you.
but you leave me no choice.</i>

546
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:48,759
我不想跟你打，但你让我别无选择

547
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:55,137
小子，你刚让我有了一个好主意！
<i>Boy.you just gave me
a great idea!</i>

548
01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:02,207

<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

551
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,094
这是给你的，一个礼物

552
01:08:17,298 --> 01:08:20,859

Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

553
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,637
你喜欢吗？不错吧？
How do you like it?
Nice. eh?

554
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,644
麦克拉芬先生？
Mr. McGuffin?

555
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:36,643
我可以跟你谈谈吗？
Can I have a word with you?

556
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,094
给，合同款，两万，对吧？
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand. right?

557
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:03,136
他叫诺曼・斯丹斯菲尔德
住4602房间
His name is Norman Stansfield.
and he's in room 4602...

558
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:06,196
在联邦广场26号禁毒署大厦
in the D.E.A. building.
26 Federal Plaza.

559
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:09,735
- 我不干
- 为什么？
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

560
01:10:10,478 --> 01:10:12,469
- 太难了
- 好吧
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

561
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,411
那天你把装备租给我好吗？
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

562
01:10:14,482 --> 01:10:17,178
我的装备概不外借
I never lend out my gear.

563
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,116
但是…
But...

564
01:10:19,186 --> 01:10:21,154
你有自己的枪，用它吧
you still have your gun.
Use it.

565
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:24,555
帮个忙，别往窗外开枪了
Just do me a favor.
Dongt shoot out the window.

566
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:27,192
你为什么对我这么吝啬？
Why are you so mean to me?

567
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:31,263
粗暴的杀人你啥话不说…
Wildly killing people
you dongt give a shit about...

568
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:35,063
却对杀了我全家的那些混蛋置之不理？
but you wongt get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

569
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,500
报仇并不是好事，一旦你做过之后
相信我
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

570
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:41,935
- 最好忘了吧
- 忘了？
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

571
01:10:42,009 --> 01:10:45,001
在我看过我弟弟的尸体
在地板上的轮廓线之后…
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

572
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:47,047
你期望我能忘掉？
you expect me to forget?

573
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:49,241
我要杀了那些婊子养的
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

574
01:10:49,283 --> 01:10:51,148
打爆他们他妈的头
Blow their fucking heads off.

575
01:10:51,218 --> 01:10:54,187
你杀了人之后一切都不一样了
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

576
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:59,249
你的人生会永久的改变
Your life is changed forever.

577
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:04,830
你余生连睡觉都得睁一只眼闭一只眼
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

578
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:07,459
我才不关心睡着了以后的事，利昂
I dongt give a shit
about sleeping. Leon.

579
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,460
我需要爱…
I want love...

580
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,838
或是死亡
or death.

581
01:11:13,607 --> 01:11:15,336
就这样！
That's it.

582
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:19,272
我想要死亡
I want death.

583
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,145
放过我吧，玛蒂尔达
我已经厌倦了你的游戏
Get off my case. Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

584
01:11:26,987 --> 01:11:29,114
这个游戏真的很棒，利昂
There's this really great game. Leon.

585
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:32,591
对人有益，让他们开始思考
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

586
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:39,363
你喜欢的那种游戏
The kind of game you love.

587
01:11:51,645 --> 01:11:53,510
如果我赢了…
If I win...

588
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:57,484
你要跟我…一生一世
you keep me with you...
for life.

589
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,282
如果你输了呢？
And if you lose?

590
01:12:01,355 --> 01:12:04,882
你自己去买东西吧，就像以前一样
Go shopping alone. like before.

591
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:09,361
你会输的，玛蒂尔达
You're gonna lose. Mathilda.

592
01:12:11,031 --> 01:12:13,898
子弹已经上膛了，我听出来了
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

593
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:15,265
那又如何？
So what?

594
01:12:15,336 --> 01:12:18,362
如果我被子弹击中头部终结一生
你会怎样？
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

595
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,608
没什么
Nothing.

596
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:28,674
我希望你没有撒谎，利昂
I hope you're not lying. Leon.

597
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:33,382
我真希望你内心深处没有爱情
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

598
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:38,448
因为如果有…
Because if there is...

599
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:41,892
哪怕那么一丁点儿对我的爱…
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

600
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,292
我想等会儿你就会为沉默而后悔
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

601
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,179
我爱你，利昂
I love you. Leon.

602
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,595
我赢了
I win.

603
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,515
我中了一枪
I took a hit.

604
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:40,651
我需要个助手
I need a hand now.

605
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:44,953
我知道她还小，但她学的很快
I know she's young.
but she learns fast.

606
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:47,152
孩子需要目标去成长，对吧？
Kids need to be shaped
into something. right?

607
01:13:47,227 --> 01:13:50,424
我知道，是我教给你的
但不是有年龄限制吗？
I know. I taught you that.
But aingt there an age limit?

608
01:13:50,497 --> 01:13:52,431
她十八岁了
She's 1 8.

609
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:54,433
真的？
Really?

610
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:00,105
有什么喝的吗，托尼？
How about something to drink. Tony?

611
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,541
当然了，麦诺劳，给利昂一杯牛奶
Sure. Manolo. glass of milk
for Leon.

612
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,114
纹身挺靓
Nice tattoo.

613
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:16,180
麦诺劳，拿两杯来
Manolo. make that two.

614
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:38,475
- 那是干什么？
- 感冒了可治不起啊
- What's that for?
- Cangt afford to catch cold.

615
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:41,481
首先你要找出防盗链在哪儿
First you find out
where the chain is.

616
01:14:41,548 --> 01:14:45,006
你看不见，但你能感觉到，这儿
You cangt see it.
but you can feel it. Here.

617
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:47,679
- 我要按铃，你讲话
- 我说什么？
- I'll ring. you start talking.
- What do I say?

618
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:50,520
随你便
Whatever you want.

619
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:54,493
- 谁啊？
- 嗨
- Yes?
- Hi.

620
01:14:54,561 --> 01:14:56,495
我是苏珊
It's Susan.

621
01:14:56,563 --> 01:14:59,760
对不起，你走错门了，小姑娘
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door. little girl.

622
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,301
我不认识什么苏珊
I dongt know any Susan.

623
01:15:02,369 --> 01:15:06,430
往后站点儿，我什么也看不见
Move back a little.
I cangt see anything.

624
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:09,169
灯不亮了
The light's out.

625
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:11,143
外面很黑
It's all dark out here.

626
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:18,818
- 先生，我很害怕
- 好吧
- Mister. I'm scared.
- Okay.

627
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:26,322
你他妈的干什么？
What the fuck are you doing?

628
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:32,794
张开
Open up.

629
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:37,661
只要松嘴我就开枪
<i>If it leaves your mouth.
I'll pull the trigger. capisce?</i>

630
01:16:15,275 --> 01:16:17,505
没事，松开吧
Here's okay.
Let it go.

631
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:19,876
我说了，“松开吧”
I said. '' Let it go.''

632
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:22,412
过去，去那边
Move. Move over.

633
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:25,442
放松，放松
Easy. Easy.

634
01:16:25,519 --> 01:16:28,454
放松，小心点，你先让我…
Easy. Careful.
You want me--

635
01:16:30,124 --> 01:16:32,718
去吧，该你了

求求你，不要打我
Help me.
Please dongt beat me.

637
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,737
先生？
Sir?

638
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:49,833
先生，这不是我的毒品
Sir. it's not my dope.

639
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:51,878
先生，看我
Sir. look I--

640

A little left. please.

01:16:57,484 --> 01:16:58,917
之前…请…
Before-- Ple--

642
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:04,557
现在，补射一枪
Now. the security shot.

643
01:17:09,429 --> 01:17:12,557
不，第二枪要打在胸部上面一点
No. the second goes
higher on the chest.

644
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,931
瞄准心脏和肺部
Aim for the heart and lungs.

645
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:17,163
这儿，就这儿，你明白吗？
There. Right there.
You see?

646
01:17:17,237 --> 01:17:19,171
第一枪让他丧失行动能力
The first shot takes him
out of order.

647
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:21,969
- 第二枪要他的命
- 你们他妈的在干什么？
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

648
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:23,608
别打脸
Never in the face.

649
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:26,874
如果他们认不出目标来
你就挣不到钱
If they cangt recognize the client.
you dongt get paid.

650
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:30,644
因为你有可能随便杀个人交差
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

651
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:33,447
- 明白了吗？
- 明白了，不要打脸
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

652
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,921
- 现在你可以去收拾装备了
- 你们他妈的在干什么？
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

653
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,390
接下来他妈的又干什么？嘿，先生！
What the fuck is going on?
Hey. mister!

654
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:41,893
你他妈的…
What are you fuckin--

655
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:47,628
你看见了没，当你消声器用多了之后…
You see. when you use
the silencer a lot...

656
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:49,931
你就必须放块布在这儿…
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

657
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,904
因为它非常热，在里面可能烧起来
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

658
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:55,737
黑湿布最好
A damp. black cloth is the best.

659
01:17:59,213 --> 01:18:00,976
你在干什么？
What you doing?

660
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:04,381
我们说了不杀妇孺
We said no women. no kids.

661
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:08,012
你觉得这些会杀了谁？
吸毒的和猴子吗？
Who do you think this is gonna kill.
junkies and monkeys?

662
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,934
现在干净了
Now it's clean.

663
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:29,840
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

664
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:45,324
我觉得我们不应该喝酒
I thought we dongt have
the right to drink.

665
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:49,522
我知道，但为了你的第一次
我们可以例外一次
I know. but we're making
an exception for your first time.

666
01:18:51,598 --> 01:18:56,900
好吧，如果我们为了一个
做的漂亮的活儿而例外的话…
Well. if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

667
01:18:56,937 --> 01:19:00,805
来个吻怎么样，就像电影里那样？
how about a kiss.
like in the movies?

668
01:19:04,544 --> 01:19:06,478
好
Yes.

669
01:19:07,547 --> 01:19:09,310
你要干什么？
What you doing?

670
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,749
- 我要吻你
- 我要你停下，求你了
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop. please.

671
01:19:11,818 --> 01:19:14,685
来吧，仅仅是一个吻
Come on.Just a kiss.

672
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:18,020
停下，别人在看我们呢
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

673
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,929
坐下
Go sit down.

674
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:32,004
请慢用
Enjoy.

675
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:40,579
- 你不相信我，是不是？
- 何以见得？
- You dongt believe me. do you?
- How's that?

676
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:45,642
- 我说我爱上你时
- 玛蒂尔达，换个话题吧
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda. please drop it.

677
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:49,553
- 换个题目，好不好？
- 好，对不起
-Just change the subject. okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

678
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:54,818
那么，你第一次失恋是多大？
So. how old were you
when you made your first hit?

679
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:57,523
十九
Nineteen.

680
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:59,531
打击很大吧
Beat you.

681
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:08,458
- 你在干什么？
- 感冒了可治不起啊
- What you doing?
- Cangt afford to catch a cold.

682
01:21:55,081 --> 01:21:58,915
- 没有门铃
- 那就敲门
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

683
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:05,648
- 谁啊？
- 嗨
- Yes?
- Hi.

684
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,993
我找鲁本先生的房间…
I'm looking
for Mr. Reubengs apartment...

685
01:22:08,061 --> 01:22:11,861
但是大堂很黑，我迷路了
but it's all dark out here
in the hall. and I'm lost.

686
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:13,866
等等
Just a second.

687
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:29,245
还要吗？来啊，让我看看你他妈的脸
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

688
01:22:29,483 --> 01:22:32,077
你以为你能很容易的搞定我？
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

689
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:40,023
当遇到这样又臭又硬的
你就要知道这事不容易了
When it's tough like this.
you know it's gonna be ugly.

690
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:44,189
最好速战速决，否则我们
就要一直听他说那些废话
<i>Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.</i>

691
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:47,062
傻瓜！来啊
让我看看你他妈的脸，废柴！
Asshole! Come on. show me
your fucking face. faggot!

692
01:22:47,133 --> 01:22:49,567
- 来啊，耍把戏的
- 嘿
- Come on. gum trick.
- Hey.

693
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,068
你知道什么是指环把戏吗？
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

694
01:22:53,139 --> 01:22:55,664
指环把戏？来啊，混球，我在等着呢
Ring trick? Come on. asshole.
I'm waiting.

695
01:22:55,742 --> 01:22:57,676
耍给我看看，杂种
Show it to me. motherfucker.

696
01:23:06,686 --> 01:23:09,655
这就是指环把戏
That's the ring trick.

697
01:23:23,336 --> 01:23:27,602
马里奥，回理发店去，迟点再剪吧
Mario. go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

698
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:41,949
利昂，怎样了？一切妥当了吗？
Leon. what's up?
All done already?

699
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:47,827
比一般人强啊，是吧？
Nicer than people. eh?

700
01:23:47,894 --> 01:23:49,862
我早就说过的
I told you that.

701
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,000
- 你有麻烦了吗？
- 没有
You got a problem?

702
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:58,861
找张椅子，坐吧
Get the chair. Sit down.

703
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:08,003
我在思考
I was thinking.

704
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:14,278
如果某天我出事了
If something happens
to me someday--

705
01:24:14,354 --> 01:24:18,222
嘿，利昂，你什么事都不会有的
Hey. Leon.
nothing's gonna happen to you.

706
01:24:18,258 --> 01:24:21,227
你是刀枪不入的，你可以与子弹共舞
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

707
01:24:21,294 --> 01:24:25,390
托尼，我在为我的钱思考
Tony. I thought about my money.

708
01:24:28,768 --> 01:24:34,206
你还记得那天来这儿的
那个小女孩儿吗？
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

709
01:24:38,778 --> 01:24:43,681
她的名字是玛蒂尔达
Her name is Mathilda.

710
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,981
如果我出事了…
If anything happens to me...

711
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:51,217
我希望你…
I'd like you...

712
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:55,158
把我的钱…
to give her...

713
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,421
给她
my money.

714
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,393
没问题，利昂
You can count on me. Leon.

715
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:06,962
谢谢你，托尼
Thank you. Tony.

716
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,175
我很快就回来
I wongt be long.

717
01:25:13,747 --> 01:25:16,716
- 我做错了什么吗？
- 没有
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

718
01:25:17,817 --> 01:25:20,786
这次的活儿很棘手
This one is too big.

719
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:24,879
是啊，我只能干点儿小活儿，是不是？
Yeah. and I only get the leftovers.
is that it?

720
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:29,091
玛蒂尔达，自从遇到你以…
Mathilda. since I met you...

721
01:25:29,162 --> 01:25:31,221
一切都不同了
everything's been different.

722
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:35,926
所以我只是想单独呆一阵
So I just need some time alone.

723
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:40,729
你需要时间来长大一点
You need some time
to grow up a little.

724
01:25:40,774 --> 01:25:43,368
我已经长大了，利昂
I finished growing up. Leon.

725
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:45,308
我正在变老
I just get older.

726
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:48,906
在我看来正好相反，我太老了
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

727
01:25:50,684 --> 01:25:52,709
我需要时间成长
I need time to grow up.

728
01:26:07,801 --> 01:26:09,792
靠
Shit.

729
01:27:24,878 --> 01:27:27,210
快点！抢位！
Come on! Hustle!

730
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:31,113
- 投的好
- 来啊
- Good shot.
- Come on.

731
01:27:34,354 --> 01:27:37,050
你是新来的吧？五楼的对吧？
You're new. arengt you?
Fifth floor. right?

732
01:27:37,423 --> 01:27:40,051
- 你不能坐这儿
- 真的？为什么？
- You cangt sit here like that.
- Really. why not?

733
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:42,492
没有什么是免费的，就像停车表
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

734
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:45,531
当你停下来的时候
你就得付钱，这是规矩
When you stop. you pay.
It's the law.

735
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:47,858
- 那是在电视上
- 你说什么？
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

736
01:27:47,967 --> 01:27:51,368
- 算了，你要多少钱？
- 十块…
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

737
01:27:51,437 --> 01:27:53,166
每个月
a month.

738
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:57,272
能找钱吗？
Got change?

739
01:27:58,878 --> 01:28:01,108
没关系，我先付十个月的
Dongt worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

740
01:28:01,181 --> 01:28:03,376
我现在付的是到年底的
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

741
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:05,007
好，算一年
Okay. a year.

742
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:08,945
付了租金你们这些家伙就
不能来烦我了吧？
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

743
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,525
那就去别的地方玩吧
So go play somewhere else.

744
01:28:18,031 --> 01:28:20,295
我要想事情
I need to think.

745
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:20,420
站直了，你还想不想干了？

746
01:29:18,206 --> 01:29:21,403
Stand up.
Dongt you like your job?

747
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:31,960
吃的
Food.

748
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:40,176
- 你要去哪儿？
- 专程送达4602房间
- Where you going?
- Special delivery. room 4602.

749
01:29:40,246 --> 01:29:41,941
在这儿签名
Sign here.

750
01:29:42,015 --> 01:29:43,448
过来啊
Come here.

751
01:29:46,185 --> 01:29:50,212
- 周末玩得开心点，姑娘们
- 多谢
- Have a nice weekend. girls.
- Thanks.

752
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,224
我要去趟厕所
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

753
01:31:11,771 --> 01:31:14,296
专程送达的？
Special delivery?

754
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,308
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

755
01:31:18,444 --> 01:31:20,002
中餐？
Chinese?

756
01:31:22,749 --> 01:31:25,115
要不是泰国菜？
Thai. maybe?

757
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:30,554
我知道那是什么了
I've got it.

758
01:31:30,623 --> 01:31:32,784
意大利菜
Italian food.

759
01:31:49,509 --> 01:31:51,443
你叫什么名字，小乖乖？
What's your name. angel?

760
01:31:52,443 --> 01:31:53,443
玛蒂尔达

761
01:32:18,443 --> 01:32:19,443
玛蒂尔达

762
01:32:21,474 --> 01:32:24,602
你把那袋子放到地上去
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

763
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:31,514
好…
Good.

764
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:39,248
现在我要你告诉我
你对意大利菜知道多少
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

765
01:32:39,325 --> 01:32:42,226
还有那做菜的大厨是谁？
Dongt forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

766
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:46,823
没人派我来，我为自己做事
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

767
01:32:49,368 --> 01:32:51,302
那就代表…
So this is something...

768
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:55,571
是私人恩怨，是不是？
personal. is it?

769
01:32:59,612 --> 01:33:03,673
我到底做了…
What filthy piece of shit...

770
01:33:03,749 --> 01:33:05,683
什么坏事了？
did I do now?

771
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:09,118
你杀了我弟弟
You killed my brother.

772
01:33:12,925 --> 01:33:14,859
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

773
01:33:23,336 --> 01:33:25,861
你想去看他吗？
And you wanna join him?

774
01:33:29,842 --> 01:33:33,573
事情总是如此
It's always the same thing.

775
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:42,820
当你开始真正害怕死亡的时候…
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

776
01:33:42,889 --> 01:33:46,518
你就会开始重视生命
that you learn
to appreciate life.

777
01:33:46,592 --> 01:33:50,892
你喜欢生命吗，宝贝儿？
Do you like life.
sweetheart?

778
01:33:57,803 --> 01:33:59,293
那真不错
That's good.

779
01:34:04,277 --> 01:34:08,213
因为我会没有压力…
Because I take no pleasure...

780
01:34:09,515 --> 01:34:12,814
去杀一个…
in taking a life...

781
01:34:12,885 --> 01:34:17,845
不关心生死的人
if it's from a person
who doesngt care about it.

782
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:30,835
斯丹，我在到处找你
Stan. I've been looking
all over for you.

783
01:34:30,903 --> 01:34:34,304
- 我找过楼上…
- 干什么？我在忙
- I checked upstairs--
- What? I'm busy.

784
01:34:34,373 --> 01:34:37,240
是马奇，哥们，他死了
It's Malky. man.
He's dead.

785
01:34:39,412 --> 01:34:42,643
马奇为我们去跟中国人做买卖
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

786
01:34:42,682 --> 01:34:45,549
但这事不是中国人干的
<i>But they got nothing
to do with it.</i>

787
01:34:45,618 --> 01:34:51,488
他们说这家伙是外地的，他是职业的
<i>They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

788
01:34:51,557 --> 01:34:54,651
他出手很快，他妈的无处不在
<i>He was fast.
He fuckingcame out of nowhere.</i>

789
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:57,663
很猛，不到两秒就干掉了中国人
<i>Boom. shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.</i>

790
01:34:57,697 --> 01:35:01,360
放松，哥们，我是警察
Easy. man.
I'm a cop.

791
01:35:01,434 --> 01:35:04,369
然后转了个身，对马奇说…
Then turns around.
says something to Malky like--

792
01:35:04,403 --> 01:35:06,530
不能杀女人和小孩儿
No women. no kids.

793
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:17,414
我觉得是私人恩怨
I think
it was something personal.

794
01:35:18,751 --> 01:35:23,984
在今天死亡就不算个事
Death is whimsical today.

795
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,781
布拉德，能听到我说话吗？
Blood. do you hear me?

796
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:59,382
能，我听着呢，斯丹，冷静点，哥们
Yeah. I hear you. Stan.
Just chill out. man.

797
01:35:59,458 --> 01:36:01,790
你把她带到我办公室好吗？
Would you take her
up to my office?

798
01:36:03,866 --> 01:36:05,356
好的
All right.

799
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:15,902
真他妈的！
Jesus fucking Christ.

800
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:29,714
“利昂，我的爱人
<i>''Leon. my love.</i>

801
01:36:29,792 --> 01:36:32,158
我已经找到了那些杀害我弟弟的家伙
<i>I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.</i>

802
01:36:32,228 --> 01:36:36,961
他们的头儿叫诺曼・斯丹斯菲尔德
在禁毒署大厦4602房间
<i>Their boss is Norman Stansfiield.
He's in the D.E.A. building. room 4602.</i>

803
01:36:37,033 --> 01:36:39,001
我要亲手干掉他们
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

804
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:42,902
如果出事的话
我在桌上给你留了两万块
<i>If something goes wrong.
I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

805
01:36:42,972 --> 01:36:46,931
这是一个合同，一个五千，好吗？
<i>It's for a contract.
Five grand a head. right?</i>

806
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:50,912
我知道做了这些之后我会感觉好点儿的
<i>I know I'll feel better
after I do this.</i>

807
01:36:50,946 --> 01:36:52,914
我爱你，玛蒂尔达”
<i>I love you. ''</i>

808
01:36:57,987 --> 01:36:59,818
等一下，我马上就回来
Wait. I wongt be long.

809
01:36:59,889 --> 01:37:03,120
我不能在这儿停车，这是联邦大厦！
I cangt park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

810
01:37:07,763 --> 01:37:11,062
他必须按我说的办
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

811
01:37:11,133 --> 01:37:13,761
一把九毫米手枪
A nine ''millie.''

812
01:37:13,836 --> 01:37:15,963
子弹
Bullets.

813
01:37:16,005 --> 01:37:17,370
另一把九毫米手枪
Another nine ''millie.''

814
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,935
你打算用这些枪来干什么？
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

815
01:37:23,012 --> 01:37:25,981
她可能想杀掉整座大厦的人
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

816
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:31,984
我靠！
Holy shit!

817
01:37:32,021 --> 01:37:33,750
这是什么？午餐啊
What's this? Lunch.

818
01:37:36,258 --> 01:37:38,317
小心点，布拉德，可能有毒
Careful. Blood.
might be poisoned.

819
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:40,385
没有凤尾鱼啊
There's no anchovies on this.

820
01:37:57,913 --> 01:38:01,542
这就是你说的“我马上回来”？
我等了十分钟了
Is that what you call ''I wongt be long''?
I been here for ten minutes.

821
01:38:01,784 --> 01:38:04,344
我尽最大努力了
I did my best.

822
01:38:52,101 --> 01:38:53,534
你喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

823
01:38:55,404 --> 01:38:56,564
是的
Yes.

824
01:38:57,273 --> 01:38:59,241
那就说出来
So say it.

825
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,210
我喜欢
I like it.

826
01:39:18,127 --> 01:39:19,424
不渴吗？
Not thirsty?

827
01:39:28,938 --> 01:39:31,964
你要知道，一个女孩的第一次很重要
You know. a girl's first time
is very important.

828
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:35,101
那决定了她一生的性福
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

829
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:38,271
我在我姐姐的杂志上读过一篇
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

830
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:42,041
我的朋友们告诉我
她们痛恨第一次的经历
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

831
01:39:43,252 --> 01:39:46,415
那是因为她们根本就不爱那些家伙
That's because
they didngt love the guys.

832
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:49,949
她们做只是因为炫耀
They just did it to show off.

833
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:53,654
接下来，她们开始喜欢做，喜欢抽烟
Afterwards. they started liking it.
like cigarettes.

834
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:00,424
我的第一次会高兴吗？
Will I like it the first time?

835
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,531
玛蒂尔达，不行
Mathilda. no.

836
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,478
为什么？
Why not?

837
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:13,141
就是不行
I just cangt.

838
01:40:14,183 --> 01:40:16,617
- 你另有所爱？
- 不是
- You love someone else?
- No.

839
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,418
我的意思是…
I mean--

840
01:40:23,025 --> 01:40:25,585
很久之前有个人
There was someone a long time ago.

841
01:40:26,962 --> 01:40:29,226
在我来美国之前
Before I came to the States.

842
01:40:29,665 --> 01:40:33,032
她父亲不想让她见我
Her father didngt want her
to see me.

843
01:40:33,702 --> 01:40:37,263
她出身名门
She was from
a very respectable family.

844
01:40:38,474 --> 01:40:40,032
而我…
Mine was...

845
01:40:40,709 --> 01:40:42,574
你知道…
you know...

846
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:46,075
没什么名望
not so respectable.

847
01:40:46,148 --> 01:40:50,050
她父亲百般阻挠她来见我
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

848
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:52,349
但她仍不死心，对吧？
She still snuck off
to see you. right?

849
01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:55,486
对
Right.

850
01:40:55,557 --> 01:40:58,048
看见了没，没什么能阻止爱情，利昂
See. nothing can stop love. Leon.

851
01:41:00,429 --> 01:41:02,420
他父亲杀了她
He killed her.

852
01:41:03,165 --> 01:41:05,258
一枪射在头上
One shot through the head.

853
01:41:08,704 --> 01:41:13,038
他们把他投进大牢，两天后获释
They kept him in jail for two days.
and they let him go free.

854
01:41:14,977 --> 01:41:17,138
他们说那是一个意外
They said it was an accident.

855
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:20,714
所以
So...

856
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:24,544
一天晚上，我…
one night I...

857
01:41:25,054 --> 01:41:27,045
等到了他
waited for him.

858
01:41:28,324 --> 01:41:30,656
500英尺开外我带着瞄准镜
Five hundred feet with a lens.

859
01:41:33,529 --> 01:41:35,394
于是他也有了一个意外
He also had an accident.

860
01:41:36,598 --> 01:41:40,329
当天晚上我乘船来到了这儿…
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

861
01:41:40,402 --> 01:41:44,498
遇到了我父亲，他在给托尼干活儿
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

862
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,304
那时我十九岁
I was 1 9.

863
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:54,513
从此我再没离开这座城市，而且…
Since then I've never left
the city. and...

864
01:41:58,253 --> 01:42:00,551
我再没有找女朋友
I've never had another girlfriend.

865
01:42:03,592 --> 01:42:06,254
你明白吗，玛蒂尔达…
You see. Mathilda...

866
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:08,387
我不会是一个好恋人的
I wouldngt be a good lover.

867
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:12,394
好吧
Okay.

868
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,699
你能帮我一个忙吗？
Would you do me one favor?

869
01:42:17,773 --> 01:42:19,331
什么？
What?

870
01:42:19,408 --> 01:42:21,740
看到你在椅子上睡觉很不舒服
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

871
01:42:21,777 --> 01:42:24,109
我们应该同床共枕
We're gonna share the bed.

872
01:42:25,047 --> 01:42:27,311
我不觉得这是一个好主意
I dongt think it's a good idea.

873
01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,550
不错
It's okay.

874
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:33,120
把你的腿放到床上
Put your legs up on the bed.

875
01:42:33,155 --> 01:42:35,214
好，这样很好
Yeah. That's nice.

876
01:42:39,561 --> 01:42:42,052
躺下，很好，放松
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

877
01:43:03,685 --> 01:43:05,653
晚安，利昂
Good night. Leon.

878
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:10,455
晚安
Good night.

879
01:43:32,881 --> 01:43:35,213
我要第一块蛋糕！
I want a piece of cake first!

880
01:43:40,255 --> 01:43:44,419
麦诺劳，带孩子们去厨房
Manolo. take the kids
in the kitchen.

881
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:06,571
我对你的生意很尊重，托尼
I have a lot of respect
for your business. Tony.

882
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:09,277
你以前为我们杀人的时候…
When you've killed for us
in the past...

883
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:12,752
我们总是很满意
we've always been satisfied.

884
01:44:12,821 --> 01:44:18,487
那就是为什么对我来说今天很难过
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

885
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,494
请恕我冒犯
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

886
01:44:24,666 --> 01:44:28,659
我的手下在你的地盘死了
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

887
01:44:28,737 --> 01:44:31,797
那些中国佬说那个杀手…
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

888
01:44:31,874 --> 01:44:35,742
好像是意大利人
was kind of the Italian type.

889
01:44:35,777 --> 01:44:39,645
所以我估计托尼能提供点儿消息
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

890
01:44:39,715 --> 01:44:42,240
等等，还有
Wait. There's more.

891
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:44,410
你会喜欢听的
You're gonna love this.

892
01:44:46,722 --> 01:44:52,183
几小时前，一个12岁大的小姑娘
来到我办公室…
A few hours later. a little 1 2-year-old
girl comes into my office...

893
01:44:52,261 --> 01:44:56,891
武装到了牙齿
很执着的要送我去太平间
armed to the teeth. with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

894
01:44:56,965 --> 01:45:00,765
你知道谁来大厦带走了她吗？
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

895
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:04,302
一样的…
The very same...

896
01:45:04,373 --> 01:45:06,432
意大利杀手
Italian hit man.

897
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:13,504
我渴望见他一面
I'm dying to meet him.

898
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:22,553
放松，一切正常，睡的好吗？
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

899
01:45:22,624 --> 01:45:26,754
我从来没有真正睡着
总是睁一眼闭一眼
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

900
01:45:26,828 --> 01:45:28,796
是啊，我忘了
Yeah. I forgot.

901
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:31,799
我从没见过睁一眼闭一眼的人
打呼噜这么厉害
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

902
01:45:33,435 --> 01:45:36,404
- 我打呼噜？
- 就跟一个婴儿一样
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

903
01:45:37,906 --> 01:45:40,932
我要去买点早餐牛奶，马上就回来
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I wongt be long.

904
01:45:40,976 --> 01:45:42,876
你回来的时候别忘了暗号
Dongt forget the code
when you come back.

905
01:45:42,945 --> 01:45:45,539
两下，一下，再两下，是吧？
Two knocks. then one.
and two knocks again. Right?

906
01:45:45,614 --> 01:45:46,979
对
Right.

907
01:46:07,469 --> 01:46:10,404
先算这些，我去拿点牛奶
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

908
01:46:30,692 --> 01:46:32,660
从现在开始，你不许出声
From here on out.
you dongt make a sound.

909
01:46:32,728 --> 01:46:36,664
你回答我的问题，点头是摇头不是
你明白吗？
<i>You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.</i>

910
01:46:36,732 --> 01:46:39,360
他一个人吗？
Is he alone?

911
01:46:39,434 --> 01:46:41,561
他在等你回去吗？
Does he expect you?

912
01:46:41,637 --> 01:46:44,800
你有房间钥匙吗？
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

913
01:46:44,873 --> 01:46:48,070
有敲门的暗号吗，让他知道是你？
Is there a code. a way of knocking.
so he knows it's you?

914
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:37,656
第一组
Alpha team.

915
01:47:37,726 --> 01:47:41,389
- 已经就位，我们准备行动
- 小心点
<i>- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.</i>

916
01:48:28,443 --> 01:48:31,571
怎么了？闪开！操
What up? Move! Fuck.

917
01:48:36,852 --> 01:48:38,717
靠
Shit.

918
01:48:40,088 --> 01:48:42,079
第一组，有人牺牲
Alpha team. Man down.

919
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:44,551
我早跟你说过了
I told you.

920
01:48:45,551 --> 01:48:46,551
班尼

921
01:48:49,464 --> 01:48:52,092
- 把所有人都找来
- 你什么意思，“所有人”？
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean. ''everyone''?

922
01:48:52,167 --> 01:48:54,692
所有人！
Everyone!

923
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:50,524
拿着
Take this.

924
01:49:56,231 --> 01:49:59,462
过去看看
Go take a look.

925
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:16,781
- 不许动
- 你看到了什么？
- Dongt move.
- Do you see anything?

926
01:50:18,687 --> 01:50:22,623
是那个家伙，他就在这儿
用枪指着我的头
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

927
01:50:25,727 --> 01:50:27,160
大家别动
Nobody moves.

928
01:50:27,229 --> 01:50:30,130
- 放了那女孩儿
- 别紧张，哥们！
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy. man!

929
01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:32,130
放了那女孩儿

930
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:36,034
好，那女孩儿过来了，放了那女孩儿
Okay. the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.

931
01:50:46,114 --> 01:50:49,515
把墙上的斧头拿下来，那儿，快！
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

932
01:50:52,821 --> 01:50:54,846
你跟我们一起来
You're coming with us.

933
01:51:07,068 --> 01:51:08,865
上帝啊，他向他开枪了！
Christ. he shot him!

934
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:12,798
混蛋！
Bastard!

935
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:23,215
退后！退后！退后！
Move!

936
01:51:27,255 --> 01:51:29,348
- 关掉他妈的水阀！
- 明白
- Shut the fucking water off!.
- Got it.

937
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:31,684
来！
Come!

938
01:51:32,827 --> 01:51:36,558
我们这儿有麻烦，派援兵来
重复，派援兵来
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

939
01:51:46,675 --> 01:51:50,236
我不知道出什么事了
我没看见他们来，我发誓！
I dongt know what happened.
I didngt see 'em coming. I swear!

940
01:51:50,312 --> 01:51:55,944
我只是去购物然后就回来
然后他们就满地都是了
I just went shopping and I came back.
and they were everywhere.

941
01:51:57,752 --> 01:51:59,845
离开窗户，玛蒂尔达
Stay away from the window.

942
01:52:46,201 --> 01:52:47,725
过来
Come here.

943
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:51,628
狙击手
Snipers.

944
01:52:53,708 --> 01:52:57,439
好，现在，干掉那个混蛋吧
Okay. now. get this fucking asshole
out of there.

945
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:19,098
- 我们现在怎么离开这儿？
- 这事交给我，我们试试
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

946
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:23,220
这太小了你下不去啊，我才刚刚好
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

947
01:54:23,298 --> 01:54:27,132
- 我们说过不能讨价还价的
- 不，我不能让…
- We said no discussion.
- No. I'm not letting--

948
01:54:27,202 --> 01:54:32,162
- 我不走，我不会走的！
- 听我说
- I'm not going! I wongt go!
- Listen to me.

949
01:54:33,775 --> 01:54:36,005
我们在一起一点机会都没有
但如果我是一个人，我能做得到
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone. I can do it.

950
01:54:36,077 --> 01:54:38,272
相信我吧，我有数
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

951
01:54:38,346 --> 01:54:41,179
我在托尼那儿有一大笔钱
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

952
01:54:41,216 --> 01:54:43,946
我们会取出来然后一起离开
就我们俩，好吗？
We'll take it and leave together.
just the two of us.

953
01:54:44,018 --> 01:54:45,017
走吧
Go.

954
01:54:45,287 --> 01:54:48,888
你这么说了我就不担心了
You're saying that
so I wongt worry.

955
01:54:52,827 --> 01:54:56,194
- 我不能失去你
- 你不会失去我的
- I dongt wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

956
01:54:56,264 --> 01:54:58,232
你让我体会到了生命的美好
You've given me
a taste for life.

957
01:54:58,266 --> 01:55:01,531
我想高高兴兴的安安稳稳的在床上睡觉
I wanna be happy.
sleep in a bed. have roots.

958
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,863
你不会再孤独了
You'll never be alone again.

959
01:55:07,175 --> 01:55:10,338
求求你，现在就走，宝贝，走吧
Please. go now. baby. Go.

960
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,940
冷静点，现在就走，快走
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

961
01:55:17,552 --> 01:55:21,511
托尼那儿见，我们把他们都解决掉
过一小时托尼那儿见
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

962
01:55:27,262 --> 01:55:29,457
我爱你，玛蒂尔达
I love you. Mathilda.

963
01:55:29,531 --> 01:55:31,556
我也爱你，利昂
I love you. too. Leon.

964
01:56:06,601 --> 01:56:12,164
嘿，上面那儿出什么事了？
是抓那个人，不是抓这栋大楼
Hey. what is going on up there?
Take the guy out. not the building.

965
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,453
我们发现一个还活着的！
We've got one breathing here!

966
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:38,594
快叫医生来！
Get a medic on the horn!

967
01:56:42,136 --> 01:56:44,468
闪开！让他过去！
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

968
01:56:47,175 --> 01:56:50,975
- 我们有伤员，让开！
- 走楼梯下去
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

969
01:56:54,115 --> 01:56:55,673
我们上！行动！
Let's go! Move!

970
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:57,578
带这家伙离开楼梯！
Get that guy off the stairs!

971
01:56:57,652 --> 01:57:01,213
- 带你的组回去！
- 我送他！
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

972
01:57:01,289 --> 01:57:04,315
我们有两个人下楼梯了，快点！
We've got two men coming
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

973
01:57:26,147 --> 01:57:30,015
你没事吧？嘿，我这儿需要医生！
You okay?
Hey. I need a medic over here!

974
01:57:30,084 --> 01:57:32,075
都给我动起来
Move your fucking asses.

975
01:57:32,153 --> 01:57:34,553
第一小队，房间里什么情况？
<i>Squad Number One.
what's the status on the apartment?</i>

976
01:57:34,622 --> 01:57:37,056
啥也看不见，烟太浓了，给我五分钟
<i>Cangt see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.</i>

977
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:38,490
好吧
You got it.

978
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:42,222
什么？两百人都找不到
一个男人和一个小女孩儿？
What? Two hundred men cangt find
one man and a girl?

979
01:57:42,297 --> 01:57:43,924
你找到那个小女孩儿了吗？
Did you find the girl?

980
01:57:53,141 --> 01:57:55,632
你怎么样？摘下面罩，快点
<i>How are you doing?
Take your mask off. quick.</i>

981
01:57:58,579 --> 01:58:02,640
让我看看，很深，好，这边…
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here--

982
01:58:02,717 --> 01:58:06,050
你是第三分局的吗？
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

983
01:58:08,456 --> 01:58:11,653
让我们看看，他的袖子有点儿大
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

984
01:58:15,029 --> 01:58:18,089
好吧，没事，放下来，这条
All right. fine. Put it down.
This one.

985
01:58:34,782 --> 01:58:37,012
你在这儿等两分钟，我马上回来
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

986
01:58:37,085 --> 01:58:40,486
让我带着面罩吧，能呼吸顺畅点
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

987
01:58:40,555 --> 01:58:44,548
你说的对，坐好
You're all right.
Sit tight.

988
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:55,735
快点，所有人都出去！快走！出去！
Come on. everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

989
01:59:20,261 --> 01:59:23,355
让路，哥们儿们
Clear the way. men.

990
01:59:32,407 --> 01:59:34,705
你在这儿干什么？出去，快点
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

991
02:01:25,905 --> 02:01:27,305
斯丹斯菲尔德

992
02:01:28,322 --> 02:01:30,415
为您效劳
At your service.

993
02:01:38,933 --> 02:01:42,892
这是…
This is from...

994
02:01:48,976 --> 02:01:51,342
玛蒂尔达送你的
Mathilda.

995
02:02:06,427 --> 02:02:08,327
靠
Shit.

996
02:02:29,684 --> 02:02:31,208
快离开这儿！
Get out of here!

997
02:02:34,522 --> 02:02:37,423
利昂曾叫我照顾你…
Leon asked me
to help you out...

998
02:02:37,491 --> 02:02:41,427
如果出事了，我想肯定是出事了
if something happened.
and I think something happened.

999
02:02:41,495 --> 02:02:45,295
他给你留了点儿钱
He put aside
a little cash for you.

1000
02:02:45,366 --> 02:02:48,494
我的建议是…
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

1001
02:02:48,536 --> 02:02:50,936
你年纪这么小…
seeing as how
you're still so young...

1002
02:02:51,005 --> 02:02:53,940
我将替你保管这笔钱，直到你长大
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

1003
02:02:54,008 --> 02:02:56,272
就像银行，你知道，只是…
Like a bank. you know. except...

1004
02:02:56,344 --> 02:03:00,371
比银行更好，因为银行总是会倒闭的
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

1005
02:03:00,448 --> 02:03:03,008
老托尼这儿不会
No one knocks off old Tony.

1006
02:03:03,251 --> 02:03:05,811
但这是你的钱…
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

1007
02:03:05,886 --> 02:03:09,822
你需要做的就是每隔一段时间来一趟…
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

1008
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:13,690
我会给你一些，让你有点零花钱
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

1009
02:03:14,795 --> 02:03:16,319
给
Here.

1010
02:03:16,397 --> 02:03:21,801
- 这是开头的一百块钱
- 能给我个活儿干吗？
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Cangt I get a job instead?

1011
02:03:21,869 --> 02:03:26,806
活儿？你到底能干什么？
Ajob?
What the hell can you do?

1012
02:03:26,874 --> 02:03:28,739
我可以杀人
I can clean.

1013
02:03:30,044 --> 02:03:32,569
我没有活儿给一个12岁的小孩儿…
I aingt got no work
for a 1 2-year-old kid...

1014
02:03:32,647 --> 02:03:34,706
所以别痴心妄想了！
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1015
02:03:34,782 --> 02:03:37,546
结束了！游戏结束了！
It's over!
The game's over!

1016
02:03:37,618 --> 02:03:40,416
利昂已经死了！
Leongs dead!

1017
02:03:40,454 --> 02:03:42,422
你听见我说的了吗？
You hear me?

1018
02:03:49,597 --> 02:03:54,398
拜托，你觉得我不伤心吗？
Come on. You think
I aingt hurting too?

1019
02:03:59,774 --> 02:04:02,106
但他已经死了
But he's dead.

1020
02:04:02,343 --> 02:04:06,302
你要忘记这些发狂的事
给我回学校去
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1021
02:04:07,515 --> 02:04:10,575
现在拿钱走人吧
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1022
02:04:10,651 --> 02:04:12,710
不到下个月别过来…
Dongt let me see your face
till next month...

1023
02:04:12,787 --> 02:04:17,019
因为我有名的好脾气已经快耗尽了
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1024
02:04:57,596 --> 02:05:00,565
“斯宾塞中学”

1025
02:05:08,409 --> 02:05:11,776
我的父母…
My parents...

1026
02:05:11,846 --> 02:05:13,939
死了…
died...

1027
02:05:14,014 --> 02:05:18,644
四周前的一场车祸
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1028
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:20,687
这太可怕了
It was terrible.

1029
02:05:23,157 --> 02:05:26,957
当你第一次来这儿的时候
我们没有时间去互相了解…
We didngt have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1030
02:05:27,027 --> 02:05:31,794
但我要你知道我不是那种
会让孩子失望的女人…
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1031
02:05:31,832 --> 02:05:35,131
无论她什么情况，无论她犯了什么错
whatever her situation.
whatever her mistake.

1032
02:05:35,202 --> 02:05:40,401
所以我将会尽力帮助你
欢迎回到这儿
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1033
02:05:42,176 --> 02:05:44,872
但有一个前提条件
But on one condition:

1034
02:05:44,945 --> 02:05:48,108
你必须跟我说实话，玛蒂尔达
You have to stop lying to me.
Mathilda.

1035
02:05:48,182 --> 02:05:50,480
我希望你把握机会…
I want you to take a chance...

1036
02:05:50,551 --> 02:05:53,486
并且相信我
and trust me.

1037
02:05:53,521 --> 02:05:55,989
告诉我你到底发生什么事了
Tell me what happened to you.

1038
02:05:59,493 --> 02:06:02,553
我的家人被禁毒署的官员枪杀了…
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. officers...

1039
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:05,997
是因为毒品的问题
because of a drug problem.

1040
02:06:06,066 --> 02:06:08,694
之后我跟一个全世界最好的人
生活在一起
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1041
02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:13,570
他是个杀手，这儿最棒的
但他今早死了
He was a hit man. the best in town.
but he died this morning.

1042
02:06:13,641 --> 02:06:17,543
如果你不帮我，我今晚就会死掉
If you dongt help me.
I'll be dead by tonight.

1043
02:06:36,864 --> 02:06:40,561
- 你认识她吗？
- 我从来没有见过她
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1044
02:07:07,061 --> 02:07:09,757
我想我们在这儿会过的很好的，利昂
I think we'll be okay here.

1045
02:07:10,992 --> 02:07:22,032
$ <i>He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect</i>

1046
02:07:22,422 --> 02:07:32,422
$ <i>He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect</i>

1047
02:07:33,842 --> 02:07:43,932
$ <i>He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance</i>

1048
02:07:44,982 --> 02:07:53,822
$ <i>The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance</i>

1049
02:07:56,492 --> 02:08:01,832
$ <i>I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier</i>

1050
02:08:02,292 --> 02:08:07,212
$ <i>I know that the clubs
are weapons of war</i>

1051
02:08:07,962 --> 02:08:12,282
$ <i>I know that diamonds
mean money for this art</i>

1052
02:08:12,932 --> 02:08:18,082
$ <i>But that's not
the shape of my heart</i>

1053
02:08:19,772 --> 02:08:29,692
$ <i>He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades</i>

1054
02:08:30,692 --> 02:08:39,772
$ <i>He may conceal a king in his hand
While the memory of it fades</i>

1055
02:08:42,252 --> 02:08:47,282

are the swords of a soldier</i>

$ <i>That's not
the shape of my heart</i>

1060
02:09:41,262 --> 02:09:44,972
$ <i>And if I told you
that I loved you</i>

1061
02:09:46,942 --> 02:09:49,942
$ <i>You'd maybe think
there's something wrong</i>

1062
02:09:52,322 --> 02:10:01,862
$ <i>I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one</i>

1063
02:10:04,622 --> 02:10:14,172
$ <i>Those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost</i>

1064
02:10:15,172 --> 02:10:20,512
$ <i>Like those who curse their luck
in too many places</i>

1065
02:10:21,302 --> 02:10:23,682
$ <i>And those who fear are lost</i>

the shape of my heart</i>
