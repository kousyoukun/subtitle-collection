Sweetie，What's going on?    Don't worry，Baby.

37
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,278
别担心，家常便饭而已
It's cool，Take a nap.

38
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,939
我的天
Oh，My God.

39
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,169
该死的，把两边出口都堵上了

再见

52
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:43,967
喂？       我是莫里兹奥，记得吗？
<i>Hello?     It's Morizio，Remember me?</i>

53
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:48,630
听说你回城里了           是……不，也不算是
<i>I see you're back in town.     Yeah……I mean，No</i>

54
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,640
我只呆一天
Just for today.

55
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,472
我能肯定，也是最后一天…
<i>So it's safe to say today's your last day in town…</i>

56
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:56,308

<i>and we'll never see your fat fucking face again.</i>

57
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,974
是的，没错

58
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,813
让我和那个朋友谈谈
<i>Let me speak to our mutual friend.</i>

59
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,882
他想和你谈谈
He wants to talk to you.

60
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:15,324
一定要让他明白，才放他走
<i>Make sure he understands，And let him go.</i>

61
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:27,677
你明白了吗？
Do you understand?

62
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,373
说出来       我明白了
So say it.     I understand.

63
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,849
很好

64
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,377
天啊
Jesus.

65
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,881
和平常一样两盒牛奶？
Two milk as usual?

66
00:11:23,861 --> 00:11:25,522
为何把香烟藏起来？
Why did you hide the cigarette?

67
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:29,392
这里的人太多管闲事
This building's full of rats.

68
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:33,766
我不想让老爸知道，我的麻烦够多了
I didn't want my old man to find out，Got enough problems.

69
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:44,180
怎么回事？
What happened?

70
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:48,809
骑车不小心摔的
I fell off my bike.

71
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:04,299
别告诉我爸抽烟的事，好吗？
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette，Okay?

72
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:19,246
为何你要这样对我们？     我不知道
Why are you doing this to us?     I don't know...

73
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:22,581
这几天有很多鑫钱纠纷，一定是那小子干的
People got memory problems these days，It must be the sun.

74
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:25,019
知道那小子什么时候出的    我不知道事情是怎么发生的
Know when to come out of the sun.   I don't know how it happened.

75
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,114
我能怎么样？我只是负责保管
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

76
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:30,024
我将你交给我的货看管得很好，碰都没碰一下
I hold the stuff you give to me，I don't look at it or touch it.

77
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:32,187
我甚至不知道如何搞鬼     跟我来
I don't know how to cut it.     Try to follow me.

78
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,856
六月时，我们给你的白粉，纯度是100%
In June，We gave you the dope，It tests 100 percent pure.

79
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:38,527
到了七月，我们给你的那些白粉，纯度只有90%
Now it's July,We pick up the dope,And it tests 90 percent pure.

80
00:12:38,602 --> 00:12:42,129
六月到七月之间，10%被掺了
Somewhere between June and July，Ten percent turned to cut!

81
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,471
我不知道啊，你给东西我，我帮你保管，我就知道这么多
I don't know，It's none of my business，You give me the stuff，I hold it.

82
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:49,034
那些我都知道     我只是想帮你…
That's all I know.     I'm trying to help you out here...

83
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:51,775
但你若死不认帐的话…
but if you're gonna be a hard-ass about it...

84
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:54,215
那我就去打搅他一下
I gotta disturb him.

85
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:59,551
他最讨厌在听歌时，别人打搅他
When he's into his music，He hates being disturbed.

86
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:01,887
我说的都是实话
I'm telling you the truth.

87
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,225
我也希望是，因为他能分辨真假…
I hope so，Because he's got a talent for sniffin' out a lie.

88
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:08,127
很可怕的
It's scary.

89
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,292
他像有第六感
It's almost like a sixth sense.

90
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:15,236
你想改变主意呢、还是我去打搅他？
Are you gonna change your tune or I gotta bust into his?

91
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,907
我说的都是实话
I'm telling you the truth.

92
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:28,917
好吧
All right.

93
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:33,249
史丹
Stan.

94
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,289
对不起，他说没有吞掉那些白粉
I'm sorry，He said he didn't cut the dope.

95
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,665
当然不是他偷的
Of course he didn't.

96
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,813
帮我个忙
Just do me a favor.

97
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,581
明天前找出是谁干的
Find out who did by tomorrow.

98
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:39,485
中午之前
Noon.

99
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:53,662
迈基，等一下
Malky，Wait.

100
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:56,763
我没有吞你的货…
I didn't cut your shit.

101
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,274
你自己去查吧！
Find out yourself!

102
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:05,681
你在这干嘛？进屋做功课去！
What are you doin' out here? Get inside and do your homework！

103
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,411
我已经做完了  是吗？那进去帮你姐…
I did it already.  Get inside and help your sister...

104
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:10,009
收拾该死的屋子！
clean up the goddamn house!

105
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:12,180
别再抽烟了
And stop smoking cigarettes!

106
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,093
1！
<i>One!</i>

107
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:06,593
2.深吸一口气
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

108
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,729
呼气
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

109
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:12,901
深呼吸                时间到了，该我看了
<i>Take a deep breath. Inhale.Time's up. My turn.</i>

110
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:15,706
如果转台的话，我打爆你的头
Change the channel，And I'll smash your face.

111
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:18,179
现在是腿部运动，下蹲
<i>Ready for the legs，And down.</i>

112
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,919
对不起，小宝贝
Sorry，Sweetheart.

113
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,826
收紧，放松
<i>Squeeze，Release.</i>

114
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:36,161
早上好
Good morning.

115
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,292
你好，宝贝
Hi，Honey.

116
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:43,803
亲爱的，小声点，妈听得头痛了
Sweetheart，Turn that down，Mama's got a headache.

117
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:47,105
她不让我换台     她想看那些该死的卡通片
She took my turn.     She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

118
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:49,111
该多看健身节目
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass.

119
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:51,170
我又没有大屁股
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.

120
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,512
两次向上
<i>Two and up.</i>

121
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,017
那个整天没事干，只会看卡通片？
Can someone who's doing nothing all day but watching cartoons...

122
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:58,680
能去买点吃的回来吗？
move a little ass and go get some food?

123
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:03,249
到腿部运动    有种就再说一次！
<i>Legs. Beautiful.   I dare you to say that again.</i>

124
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:11,695
麦姬，我有麻烦了.     又不是第一次
Margie，I think I screwed up.     It wouldn't be the first time.

125
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:15,204
你总有麻烦，对吗？
You always come up with somethin'， Right?

126
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:17,536
我想我这次做的有点过份了
I think I went too far this time.

127
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:21,043
你现在就很过份，我上班要迟到了
You're goin'too far right now，I'm gonna be late for work.

128
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:23,545
今天在家上班吧
How about workin'at home today?

129
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:29,375
感觉到了吗？对了，收腹
<i>Really feel it.That's it， Stomach in.</i>

130
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:33,048
1…     现在该我了！
<i>One...     Now it's my turn!</i>

131
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,683
妈的，她要打我！
Shit，She's gonna hit me!

132
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,193
爸爸，她要……      妈的，把门关上
Daddy，She's...      Shit，Shut the goddamn door!

133
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,527
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

134
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:45,867
臭婊子
Fuckin' bitch.

135
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:50,737
<i>- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

136
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:54,868
<i>When you use the Quadra-Step.
Your thigh muscles...</i>

137
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,937
谁来接电话                   我在忙
Can somebody answer the phone?   I'm busy!

138
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:06,922
喂？  我是马格莱特老师…
<i>Hello?   This is Marguerite McCallister...</i>

139
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,484
新泽西州斯宾塞中学的校长
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School in Wildwood. NewJersey.</i>

140
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,257
兰多先生或太太在家吗？
<i>Is Mr. Or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

141
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:19,226
我就是兰多太太
This is she.

142
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:22,601
兰多太太，你丈夫送玛蒂尔达进校时…
<i>Mrs. Lando，When your husband enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...</i>

143
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:24,936
告诉我们，她是不良少女
<i>he told us she had "Problems."</i>

144
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:27,602
但你知道，我们能把不良少女
<i>As you know，We pride ourselves on turning troubled girls...</i>

145
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,770
引入正途…
<i>into healthy.Productive young women.</i>

146
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:32,781
但她们若不肯上学，我们也无能为力了
<i>But if they are not here，There is very little we can do.</i>

147
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:36,114
玛蒂尔达未经批准，逃课两周
<i>Mathilda left school without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

148
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:39,121
虽然你丈夫预付了一年学费，但学校守则写得很清楚…
<i>I know your husband paid tuition in advance for a year...</i>

149
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:43,285
但如果您看一下我们寄给您的校规手册…
<i>but if you will refer to the rules and regulations manual we sent you...</i>

150
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,296
您就知道无正式的理由而长期缺席…
<i>you will see that unless there is a valid excuse for prolonged absence...</i>

151
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:50,299
所预缴学费不能退回
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

152
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,892
她死了
She's dead.

153
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,825
叫那小鬼快干活
Tell that fuckin' kid to do a little work around here!

154
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:21,159
收拾干净，这儿乱得让我心烦
Clean up，I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

155
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:22,664
快点！
Hurry up!

156
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,274
<i>Why am I feeling</i>

157
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,282
<i>When things could look black</i>

158
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,650
<i>That nothing
could possibly go wrong</i>

159
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:50,682
<i>This has been
a most unusual day</i>

160
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:54,956
<i>Love has made me see things</i>

161
00:20:55,031 --> 00:21:00,867
<i>In a different way</i>

162
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:32,697
生活是否永远艰辛？ 还是仅仅童年才如此？
Is life always this hard，Or is it just when you're a kid?

163
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:38,073
总是如此
Always like this.

164
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:46,247
留着用吧
Keep it.

165
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:58,158
我去买东西，你要些牛奶吗？
I'm going grocery shopping，You want some milk?

166
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:01,163
1夸脱还是2夸脱？ 买两盒，对吗？
<i>One quart or two?It's two，Right?</i>

167
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:48,634
我喜欢暴风前那片刻的宁静…
I like these calm little moments before the storm.

168
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,237
这让我想起贝多芬
It reminds me of Beethoven.

169
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,810
你听见了吗？
Can you hear it?

170
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:04,752
就像伏在草丛里…
It's like when you put your head to the grass...

171
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:07,016
你能听到小草在生长
you can hear it growin'.

172
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,854
和昆虫的爬行声…
You can hear the insects.

173
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:18,490
你喜欢贝多芬吗？     算不上吧
Do you like Beethoven?   Couldn't really say.

174
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,536
我来为你们演奏
I'm gonna play you some.

175
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:25,940
爸爸
Daddy!

176
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,354
你守在这里
You better stay here.

177
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:23,065
我们说好是中午的
We said noon.

178
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,537
已经过了一分钟
I've got one minute past.

179
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:34,602
你不喜欢贝多芬
You don't like Beethoven.

180
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,044
你就错过了很多东西…
You don't know what you're missing.

181
00:25:38,114 --> 00:25:42,608
序曲能令人热血沸腾…
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.

182
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:45,279
它是如此铿锵有力…
So powerful.

183
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:49,519
但序曲过后，说真的…
But after his openings，To be honest...

184
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:53,688
实在他妈的有点闷
he does tend to get a little fucking boring.

185
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:57,992
所以我停下了
That's why I stopped!

186
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,637
搜查这屋子
Toss the apartment.

187
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:29,094
你喜欢莫扎特，我也喜欢他
You're a Mozart fan，I love him too.

188
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:32,157
我也爱听莫扎特
I love Mozart!

189
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,741
你知道，他是奥地利人
He was Austrian，You know.

190
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,575
但这方面的造诣就不怎么样了…
But for this kind of work.He's a little bit light.

191
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:46,672
我比较爱听震撼些的
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

192
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:50,344
酷    你他妈的在干什么？
Cool. Dude. What the fuck are you doing?

193
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,184
闭上你的臭嘴
<i>Man.Keep your bombacut mouth shut.</i>

194
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:57,124
听听勃拉姆斯的作品，他也不错的
Check out Brahms，He's good too.

195
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:59,753
你懂个屁音乐？            踢开它
What the fuck do you know about music?Man. Knock it off!

196
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,444
你查过床了吗？       没有
You check the mattress?  Nope.

197
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:00,855
哇！
Wow.

198
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:23,373
妈的
Oh! Fuck!

199
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:25,778
他死了
He's dead.

200
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:30,114
天啊，看看你都干了些什么
Jesus，Look what you did.

201
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:32,120
史丹，你没事吧？
Stan，You all right?

202
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:54,476
你干嘛？
What are you doin'?

203
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:58,640
他已经死了！    他弄脏了我的西服
He's dead!           But he ruined my suit.

204
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,206
我知道，但他已死了
Yeah. I know.But he's dead.

205
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:04,651
他现在只是一滩烂肉，算了吧，冷静点
He's a piece of meat，Forget about it，Calm down.

206
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:06,245
我很冷静
I'm calm.

207
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:08,552
等在这儿，  好的
Stay there，All right?

208
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:14,362
班尼、班尼
Benny!

209
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,194
真他妈该死，班尼！是我和史丹
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!It's Malky and Stan!

210
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,867
冷静些，好吗？
Take it easy，All right?

211
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:27,739
走吧
Come on.

212
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:33,515
走吧，我们出去抽支烟
Come on，Let's get a cigarette.

213
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,074
班尼，我们出来了
Benny，We're comin' out!

214
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:38,950
班尼，别开枪
Benny，Don't fire!

215
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:41,819
进去
Get in there!

216
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,291
该死的班尼
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!

217
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,989
我不该穿新西服       要点火吗？
You wear somethin' new and...Got a light?

218
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:50,032
冷静点
Take it easy.

219
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,201
发生什么事了？
What's happening out there?

220
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:55,134
没事，我们是缉毒署的警察
It's all right，Ma'am.D.E.A. Police.

221
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:58,401
放过这可怜的一家吧
Leave that poor family alone.

222
00:29:58,474 --> 00:30:02,103
没事了，     冷静点           我很冷静！我很冷静！
Everything's all right，Just calm down，I am calm. I'm calm.

223
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:04,408
何不放过这可怜的一家？
Why don't you leave them alone?

224
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:08,909
他叫你回屋里去
He said go back inside.

225
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:16,453
史丹，我们进去吧
Stan，I think it's better if we go inside.

226
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:39,446
班尼，翻遍厨房也要找到那些白粉
Benny，Turn that kitchen upside down!Find that shit!

227
00:30:39,515 --> 00:30:43,178
血腥威利，看你干了什么？你竟然杀死一个4岁的小孩
Willy Blood，Iook what you did!You killed a 4-year-old kid!

228
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:45,186
求你开开门
Did you really have to do that?

229
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:03,699
求求你
Please open the door.

230
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:03,322
班尼，应该有三个孩子
Benny，There are three kids here.

231
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,731
我想史丹杀的是这个女孩
I think Stan killed this girl.

232
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,361
威利那杂种杀的是这个小男孩…
Willy. That asshole.Shot the little boy.

233
00:32:08,437 --> 00:32:10,962
没见到第三个，快去找她
The third one's missing，Find her.

234
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,878
妈的，有个小女孩逃脱了…
Shit，We missed the little girl. Man.

235
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:26,547
我要在这栋该死的公寓把她找出来
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super in this goddamn building.

236
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:57,381
你还没认出我吗？我，铁锁，认识你
<i>Don't you recognize me?Me，Grimlock，Know you!</i>

237
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:08,929
妈的！
Shit.

238
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:14,259
在这，我找到了       太好了
Yo!   I found it!    Bingo!

239
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:17,431
他们找到白粉了   我知道
They found it.     I know.

240
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,440
在这儿
There it is.

241
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:22,443
警察来了，我们最好快离开
There's cops outside，We better go.

242
00:33:22,511 --> 00:33:25,947
警察来了，我们要走了，你留在这儿
It's the cops outside，We better go，You stay here.

243
00:33:28,017 --> 00:33:29,484
我怎么跟他们讲？
What do I say?

244
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:43,460
告诉他们…
Tell them...

245
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:47,798
…我们在执行公务
we were doing our job.

246
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,439
你叫什么？      玛蒂尔达
What's your name?  Mathilda.

247
00:34:07,056 --> 00:34:09,581
很遗憾你父亲死了     就算他们不杀他…
Sorry about your father. If somebody didn't do it...

248
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,685
没准那天我也会杀了他
one day or another.I would have probably done it myself.

249
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,163
你妈妈，她……
Your mother，She...

250
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:17,995
她不是我亲生母亲
She's not my mother.

251
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:23,596
我姐整天想减肥，可总不见起色
My sister wanted to lose some weight，Bet she never looked better.

252
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:26,574
她也不是我亲姐，只是同父异母
She's not even my real sister，Just a half sister.

253
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:29,008
她不是个好姐姐
Not a good half at that.

254
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:41,322
既然你受不了他们，那为何要哭呢？
If you couldn't stand them，Why are you crying?

255
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,359
那些人杀了我弟弟
They killed my brother.

256
00:34:44,427 --> 00:34:48,659
他做错了什么？他才4岁…
What the hell did he do?He was four years old.

257
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,665
他不爱哭
He never used to cry.

258
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:54,760
他只喜欢伴在我身边
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

259
00:34:54,837 --> 00:34:59,740
我比那臭母猪更像他妈妈
I was more of a mother to him than that goddamned pig ever was.

260
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:04,212
那样骂猪可不好，猪通常比人更友善
Don't talk like that about pigs，They're usually nicer than people.

261
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,510
可它们臭气熏天
But they smell like shit.

262
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:09,884
那倒不是
Not true.

263
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,548
事实上，我厨房里刚好有只猪…
As a matter of fact，Right now I have one in my kitchen...

264
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:16,523
很干净…
that's very clean...

265
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:20,722
还很香呢           你厨房里没有猪
and smells very nice，You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

266
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:24,231
有的
Yes. I do.

267
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,463
我刚刚在那里，并没有看到什么猪
I was just in there，And I didn't see any goddamned pig.

268
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:30,972
别走开，我去找它
Don't move，I'll get him.

269
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:34,876
小猪，你在那里？
Piggy. Where are you?

270
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:38,413
找到你了
There you are.

271
00:35:45,488 --> 00:35:48,423
嘿，玛蒂尔达
Hi，Mathilda.

272
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:51,153
嘿，小猪
Hi，Piggy.

273
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:01,865
你今天还好吗？
How are you today?

274
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:04,497
不是太好
I've seen better days.

275
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:16,449
你叫什么名字？     里昂
What's your name?     Leon.

276
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:20,914
挺可爱的
Cute name.

277
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:31,993
有其他亲人，或者可投靠的地方吗？
You have anyone to go to，Any family anyplace else?

278
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,579
我去拿点牛奶
I'm gonna get some more milk.

279
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,700
天啊
Holy shit.

280
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,676
别碰这些
Don't touch that. Please.

281
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:18,144
里昂，你干那行的？
leon,What do you do for a living?

282
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,682
清道夫
Cleaner.

283
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,018
你是职业杀手？
You're a hit man?

284
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,157
是的     很好
Yeah      Cool.

285
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:46,197
你什么人都杀？    不杀女人，不碰小孩子，这是规矩
Do you clean anyone?No women，No kids,That's the rules.

286
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:49,335
干掉那些杀死我弟弟的坏人
How much would it cost to hire someone to get those dirtbags...

287
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:52,209
要多少钱？
who killed my brother?

288
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:56,047
5000元一个人头     哇
Five grand a head.  Wow.

289
00:37:56,118 --> 00:38:00,214
我为你打工…
How about I work for you...

290
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:03,781
…作为交换，你教我杀人好吗？
and in exchange，You teach me how to clean?

291
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,953
你觉得怎样？
What do you think?

292
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:09,054
我帮你收拾房间，买东西…
I'll clean your place，I'll do the shopping.

293
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,361
甚至洗衣服…
I'll even wash your clothes.

294
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:16,969
成交？    不，我不答应
Is it a deal?No，It's not a deal.

295
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,315
你要我怎样？我已经无家可归了
What do you want me to do?I've got no place to go.

296
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:33,219
你今天经历了一场大难
You've had a rough day today.

297
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:38,649
睡觉去吧，明天再说 好吗？
Go to sleep，And we'll see tomorrow.

298
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:56,236
你对我真好，里昂…
You've been really great with me，Leon...

299
00:38:56,312 --> 00:38:59,338
你不总是这样…
and it's not always like that.

300
00:38:59,415 --> 00:39:01,280
对吗？
You know?

301
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:10,424
晚安
Good night.

302
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,066
睡得好吗？
You sleep well?

303
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:31,470
不错
Good.

304
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,974
吃完早餐你走吧           去那？
After breakfast you gotta take off.  Where to?

305
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,705
不关我的事
Not my problem.

306
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,527
读吧
Read it.

307
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,426
你不识字？
You don't know how to read.

308
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,495
我正在学，但最近工作忙…
I'm learning，But I've had a lot of work lately...

309
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:07,633
功课没跟上
so I'm a little behind.

310
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,176
写些什么？
What's it say?

311
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:13,305
我已经决定好我以后的人生了，做一个职业杀手
I've decided what to do with my life，I wanna be a cleaner.

312
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:17,842
你想当一个职业杀手？
You wanna be a cleaner.Here.

313
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,687
拿去吧，这是道别礼物，去杀人吧，但是别跟着我
Take it，It's a good-bye gift，Go clean，But not with me.

314
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:26,353
我独来独往，明白吗？    邦尼和克雷是搭挡
I work alone，Understand?    Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

315
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:29,420
席马和刘易斯也是搭挡，而他们都是最好的
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone，They were the best.

316
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,696
玛蒂尔达，为何这样对我？
Mathilda，Why are you doing this to me?

317
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:38,433
我一直对你很好…
I've been nothing but nice to you.

318
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:41,374
昨天我在门外还救了你一命，就在门外
I saved your life yesterday，Right outside the door.

319
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:44,708
没错，所以你应该负责…
Right，Now you're responsible for it.

320
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,216
如果你要救我，你必须要救得有意义
If you saved my life，You must've saved it for a good reason.

321
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:51,047
如果你现在丢下我不管，就跟你昨天没有开门是一样的
If you throw me out now，It's like you never opened your door...

322
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,953
跟让我死在你面前一样
like you let me die right there in front of it.

323
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:59,426
但你开门救了我，所以……
But you did open it，So...

324
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:07,067
若你不帮我，我觉得自己今晚就会死
If you don't help me，I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

325
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:09,400
我不想死
I don't wanna die tonight.

326
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,408
玛蒂尔达，你只是个小女孩
Mathilda，You're just a little girl

327
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:17,411
不要这么悲观，不过  我想你不适合
Don't take it badly，But I don't think you could do it.

328
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:18,912
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

329
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,600
怎么样？
How's that?

330
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,629
不要再做这种蠢事，否则我打爆你的头
Don't you ever do that again or I'll break your head.

331
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:18,138
明白吗？   好的       
You got that? okay

332
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:22,810
是我就不会那么做，那不专业
I don't work like that，It's not professional.

333
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:24,812
这行是有规则的     好的
There is rules.    okay

334
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:28,645
还有，不要不停地说“好的”！    好的 
And stop saying "okay"all the time!  okay

335
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,312
很好
Good.

336
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,200
你不能带这东西住宿
You expect to use that in this hotel?

337
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:56,234
先生，我必须这么做
Mister，I have to use it...

338
00:43:56,311 --> 00:44:00,407
下个月我要去茱丽亚学院面试…
because I have an audition atJuilliard next month...

339
00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:02,712
而我必须练习
and I have to practice.

340
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:06,652
好吧，但只准在10点前练习
Okay，But not after 10:00.

341
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:08,780
我保证   
I promise

342
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,761
好吧，我让你们住走廊尽头的房间
All right, I'll put you at the end of the hall...

343
00:44:13,828 --> 00:44:17,924
那样就不会吵着别人了
so that you dongt disturb anyone.

344
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:19,489
请填写这表格
Fill those out. Please.

345
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:28,666
爸，我来填好吗？我最喜欢填表了
Daddy,Can I please fill them out?I like to check in to hotels.

346
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,408
谢谢，我很快就填好
Thanks,Pop.I'll bring these back in a minute.

347
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:36,746
4楼
Fourth floor!

348
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:38,410
谢谢，先生
Thanks，Mister!

349
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:41,580
你很幸运  你女儿挺有趣的
You're lucky to have a little girl that's interested in things.

350
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:47,416
我儿子17岁了，还整天游手好闲
I have a kid. 17，Does nothing all day long.

351
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:56,094
在我把行李搬上去时 我能把这植物暂时放你这吗？
Can I leave my plant here while I take my stuff upstairs?

352
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:57,968
当然可以
Of course.

353
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:22,158
我填了我最讨厌的同学的名字
I'm putting in a name of a girl in my class who makes me sick.

354
00:45:24,699 --> 00:45:28,226
要是出麻烦，由她负担好了
If things get hot，She'll take the heat.

355
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,848
拿去，填好了
There. Finished.

356
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:51,381
你几岁了？    18
How old are you?Eighteen.

357
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:55,219
18？   要看我身份证吗？
Eighteen? Want to see my license?

358
00:45:56,264 --> 00:46:00,530
不用，你看起来还要小点
No，You just look a little young.

359
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,963
谢谢
Thanks.

360
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:13,739
里昂，我希望你教我成为像你一样的人
Leon，I want you to teach me how to be like you.

361
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:16,079
我想要变得和你一样强壮和机灵       
I want to be strong and smart like you.

362
00:46:17,852 --> 00:46:20,685
我知道自己现在还不够强壮…
I know I'm not strong enough yet...

363
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:24,816
但我可以从最基本的学起，理论知识
but I could learn the basics，The theory.

364
00:46:24,893 --> 00:46:29,023
你觉得怎样？只是理论知识
What do you think?Just the theory.

365
00:46:29,097 --> 00:46:31,361
这我需要，里昂
I need this，Leon.

366
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,194
我需要时间来整理一下我的思绪
I need time to get my head together.

367
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:38,034
好的，我需要……
Yeah，And I need...

368
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:45,302
喝的
a drink.

369
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,372
别动，我去买
Dongt move，I'll go get one.

370
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:16,910
你叫我帮你找这些东西时
When you told me to get this baby out for you...

371
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:19,242
…我还以为自己听错了
I thought my hearing was going.

372
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:24,217
我想，里昂是职业杀手，只有新手才用这个
I says to myself， " Leongs a pro，Nobody uses that except beginners."

373
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:26,048
我想保持状态
I like to stay in shape.

374
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,580
当然，你是最棒的
Sure，Always stay on top of it.

375
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:34,355
就像我，我必须随时掌握这一行的最新动态
It's like me，I gotta know where everything is all the time.

376
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:36,989
我从不离开这里，除非逼不得已
I never leave this place，Except to go from here to there.

377
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:43,393
不要改变，里昂，明白吗？   是的
Change aingt good，Leon，You know?  Yeah.

378
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:55,782
检查一下
Check it.

379
00:47:57,352 --> 00:48:00,014
确定这玩意儿没问题，我信任你
Make sure it's the right thing,I trust you.

380
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:03,114
尽量少惹麻烦，你要记住，里昂
One thing's got nothing to do with the other. Remember that.leon.

381
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:06,459
我会记住
I will.

382
00:48:21,509 --> 00:48:24,478
你先要学会用来福枪…
The rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use...

383
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:28,379
它可让你远距离击杀目标
because it lets you keep your distance from the client.

384
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:30,679
但越专业的杀手
The closer you get to being a pro...

385
00:48:30,752 --> 00:48:33,949
会越接近目标…
the closer you can get to the client.

386
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:37,549
而小刀，是你要学的最后一样武器，懂吗？   明白
The knife，For example.Is the last thing you learn,okay.okay

387
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:44,664
就位
Position.

388
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:12,657
到最后一刻才能打开瞄准镜，因为它会反光
Never take it off until the last minute，It reflects light.

389
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:15,525
它能让对方在一里外就看到你的位置
They can see you coming from a mile away.

390
00:49:15,596 --> 00:49:19,327
要穿深色衣服
And always dress down.

391
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,528
衣服不能比地板明亮，懂吗？   明白
Never brighter than the floor，Okay? Okay.

392
00:49:25,406 --> 00:49:30,036
开始练习，这是最好的学习方法
Let's practice now,It's the best way to learn.

393
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,204
谁是目标？
Who should I hit?

394
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,872
随便吧
Whoever.

395
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:43,052
我等一下就让你们采访好吗？先等我几分钏，谢谢
I'll be with you in a second.Give me a few minutes，Thank you.

396
00:49:43,124 --> 00:49:45,888
你们都散开，我不想看见你们
You guys get lost，I dongt want to see you.

397
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,418
大家就位了吗？      要自然点
Is everyone in position?This has to look natural.

398
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:02,409
不杀女人和小孩子，是吗？ 是的
No women. No kids. Right? Right.

399
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:12,084
那个穿黄衣服的跑步人如何？  好的
Jogger in the yellow and orange?  Okay

400
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:19,057
保持冷静
Keep calm.

401
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,891
视线别离开目标
Dongt take your eyes off him.

402
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:27,764
放松
Breathe easy.

403
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:31,131
看准他的运动
Watch his movement.

404
00:50:33,674 --> 00:50:36,108
设想你和他在一起跑
Pretend you're running with him.

405
00:50:39,147 --> 00:50:42,275
试着感觉他的下一个运动位置
Try to feel his next movement.

406
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:47,184
深呼吸，准备
Take a deep breath，Hold it.

407
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:57,230
开枪
Now.

408
00:50:57,298 --> 00:50:59,129
我的上帝啊！
Oh. My God!

409
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,897
我没事，我很好           趴下！子弹从那射来的？
I'm all right，I'm fine.Get down! Where'd that come from?

410
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,736
射得不错吧？
One shot. Not bad. Huh?

411
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:09,242
是谁在开枪？      我透不过气了！别压着我
Who the hell fired?  I just cangt breathe! Get off me.

412
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,973
现在能实弹演习了吗？
Can we try with real bullets now?

413
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:15,015
今天不行，收拾行装
Not today，Let's pack up.

414
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:25,825
就像这样
Like that.

415
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:11,535
不，谢谢     一定要喝了
No，Thanks.    No discussion.

416
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:55,249
这一切…
"It seemed...

417
00:52:56,651 --> 00:52:58,585
在苏格拉底看来
to Socrates..."

418
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:08,328
让我来
I'll do it.

419
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:24,834
里昂，不能成天工作
Leon，All we do is work.

420
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:28,040
我们休息一下，玩个游戏吧
We need a break，Let's play a game.

421
00:53:28,115 --> 00:53:31,778
什么游戏？     我发明的游戏
What kind of game?I have this great game.

422
00:53:31,852 --> 00:53:35,652
能帮助你思考和记忆，正是你需要的               好的
It makes you think and helps your memory，It's exactly what you need. Okay.

423
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:50,628
<i>Like a virgin</i>

424
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:55,805
<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

425
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:03,341
是谁？     我不知道
Who is it?   I dongt know.

426
00:54:13,527 --> 00:54:19,295
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

427
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:23,667
<i>Happy birthday. Mr. President</i>

428
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:26,172
我不知道
I dongt know.

429
00:54:34,982 --> 00:54:36,813
小胡子
Moustache.

430
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:44,348
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

431
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:47,019
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

432
00:54:47,094 --> 00:54:49,654
金凯利？
<i>What a beaut...Gene Kelly?</i>

433
00:54:51,265 --> 00:54:52,698
对了
Good.

434
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,600
到你了
Your turn now.

435
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:02,871
好了，清教徒
Okay，Pilgrim.

436
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,747
克林特伊斯特伍德？
Clint Eastwood?

437
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:19,719
我猜不出，我放弃      约翰韦恩
I dongt know,I give up.  John Wayne.

438
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:23,787
我刚想说是他，我发誓，真棒
I was just about to say that，I swear，It's amazing.

439
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:26,230
里昂，你真是才华横溢
Leon，Really brilliant.

440
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:30,570
了不起
Amazing.

441
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:49,752
你很喜欢这盆植物吗？     它是我的好朋友
You love your plant. Dongt you? It's my best friend.

442
00:55:49,824 --> 00:55:53,419
永远快乐，从来不烦我
<i>Always happy，No questions.</i>

443
00:55:54,995 --> 00:55:58,089
和我一样 你看看
It's like me. You see.

444
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:00,326
没有根
No roots.

445
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:04,167
若你喜欢他，应该把它种在公园里 那它就能落地生根了
If you really love it，You shouldplant it in a park so it can have roots.

446
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:10,904
若要我长得快，你也应该给我浇水
You should be watering me if you want me to grow.

447
00:56:13,147 --> 00:56:14,580
你说得对
You're right.

448
00:56:26,026 --> 00:56:27,459
等等
Wait!

449
00:56:42,276 --> 00:56:46,872
它们一定得脱离盘子，才会有生机
They gotta be jumping out of the plate，They gotta be alive.

450
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:57,321
好久不见了，里昂
It's been a long time，Leon.

451
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,198
我很想你
I missed you.

452
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:10,101
而你也错过了一些好工作       我在训练
And you missed some nice jobs too. Been training.

453
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:14,164
训练是好事，但别过度了
Training's good，But dongt overdo it.

454
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:16,641
训练可不能赚钱，里昂
Training dongt pay as good as working，Leon.

455
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,177
托尼…
Tony...

456
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:25,711
我存在你那里的钱…
all the money I make.That you keep for me...

457
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:27,777
你等钱用？
You need some money?

458
00:57:27,855 --> 00:57:29,413
不，我只是好奇
Just curious.

459
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,424
我一直在工作
I've been working a long time...

460
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:35,189
从没用过那些钱
and I havengt done anything with my money.

461
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:43,100
也许有一天，我要用那笔钱
I thought maybe someday I could use it.

462
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,536
你认识了一个女人
You met a woman.

463
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:57,208
你要小心女人
You gotta be careful with women.

464
00:57:57,284 --> 00:58:00,253
还记得你刚来这的时候吗？
Remember when you arrived in this country?

465
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:04,724
我刚带你入行时，你还是个乳臭未干的小鬼
When I took you in. You were still wet behind the fucking ears...

466
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:07,727
而且你那时为了个女人弄得焦头烂额
and. Already. You were in deep shit because of a woman.

467
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:12,698
不要忘记，里昂       我希望能忘记
Dongt forget that，Leon.  I wish I could sometimes.

468
00:58:15,302 --> 00:58:17,600
你知道，关于我那笔钱…
You know，About my money...

469
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:22,074
也许我可以…
Maybe I could give...

470
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:24,235
拿一点出来
a little...

471
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:28,077
给别人
to someone.

472
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:31,242
你知道，是去帮别人
You know，To help out.

473
00:58:33,787 --> 00:58:37,814
这是你的钱，我只是帮你保管，就像银行
It's your money，I'm just holding it for you，Like a bank.

474
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:42,261
但我比银行更可靠，银行常被打劫
Except better than a bank because banks always get knocked off.

475
00:58:42,329 --> 00:58:44,661
而没人敢打劫我
No one knocks off old Tony.

476
00:58:44,732 --> 00:58:47,257
还有，银行里
Besides，With a bank...

477
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:50,599
有无数文件要填写
there's always tons of forms and all that shit.

478
00:58:50,671 --> 00:58:55,768
但我这呢？不用看、不用写，全记在我脑子里
But old Tony. Nothing to read.Nothing to write. It's all in his head.

479
00:58:57,077 --> 00:59:00,410
我现在识字了
I know how to read now.

480
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:03,609
那很好，里昂，很好
That's good，Leon.

481
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:10,884
你的钱就在这里，需要的话，问我拿好了
Your money's here,Whenever you want it,You just ask me.

482
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:15,019
拿着，这有1000块           我不需要
Here's a grand，Come on.It's okay. I dongt need it.

483
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:19,555
拿去吧，玩得开心点，拿着      谢谢
Take it，Have some fun，Go ahead.  Thank you.

484
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:23,535
好了，现在来谈谈生意
All right，Now let's talk business.

485
00:59:23,604 --> 00:59:27,131
别走开，我去拿资料
Dongt move，I'll go get the file.

486
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:31,303
Manolo,给我朋友里昂来杯牛奶
Manolo,A glass of milk for my friend Leon here.

487
00:59:54,568 --> 00:59:57,002
听着，玛蒂尔达，你要注意
Listen,Mathilda,You better be careful.

488
00:59:57,071 --> 00:59:59,665
你不可以随便和街上的人说话
You cangt just speak to any guy off the street.

489
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:03,672
里昂，别紧张，这他妈没什么大不了的
Leon，Get a grip，What's the big fucking deal?

490
01:00:03,744 --> 01:00:06,508
我只在等待的时候跟人要根烟抽烟罢了
I was just smoking a butt while I was waiting.

491
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:10,512
我要你停止讲脏话
I want you to stop cursing.

492
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:12,848
你不能总是这样和别人交谈
You cangt talk to people like that all the time.

493
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,014
花点心思，学学怎么好好说话        好的
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.  Okay

494
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:23,992
我要你戒烟，抽烟危害健康
And I want you to stop smoking，It will kill you.

495
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:33,368
离那怪人远点，他看起来不是什么好东西
Stay away from him，He looks like a weirdo.

496
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:42,211
我5分钟后出来，呆在我视线范围之内
I'll be out in five minutes，Stand where I can see you.

497
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:59,827
里昂，我想我爱上你了
Leon，I think I'm kinda falling in love with you.

498
01:01:02,403 --> 01:01:05,702
这是我的初恋，你知道吗？
It's the first time for me，You know.

499
01:01:05,773 --> 01:01:09,140
你从没谈过恋爱，如何知道什么是爱？
How do you know it's love if you've never been in love before?

500
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:12,076
我能感觉
'Cause I feel it.

501
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,738
那儿？
Where?

502
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:19,285
胃部
In my stomach.

503
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:25,647
暖暖的
It's all warm.

504
01:01:25,726 --> 01:01:30,959
以前我老是胃痛，但现在没有了
I always had a knot there，And now it's gone.

505
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:39,134
玛蒂尔达，恭喜你胃病好了
Mathilda，I'm glad you dongt have a stomachache anymore.

506
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:41,674
但这不能代表什么
I dongt think it means anything.

507
01:01:41,742 --> 01:01:45,610
我要迟到了，我讨厌工作时迟到
I'm late for work，I hate being late for work.

508
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,015
你女儿的小提琴练得怎样了？
How's the practicing going?

509
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:07,086
今天过得可好？小姐      练琴练得闷坏了
How are we today. Miss?   A little sick of practicing.

510
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:09,095
我懂，但你很乖
I understand.

511
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:11,097
从不吵到别人
But you're doing all right.

512
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,156
我还没接到任何投诉
I havengt received any complaints.

513
01:03:13,233 --> 01:03:17,499
我在弦上盖上布来减少音量
I put a cloth over the strings to lessen the noise.

514
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:20,163
真聪明
That's very smart.

515
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,870
不是人人爱听音乐的       我知道
Not everyone loves music.  I know.

516
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:27,072
你爸究竟是干嘛的？
What does your father do?

517
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:32,942
他是作曲家     真了不起
He's a composer. That's wonderful.

518
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,580
他其实不是我父亲
Except he's not really my father.

519
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:42,890
他是我的爱人
He's my lover.

520
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:50,300
我出去散步
Think I'll go for a walk.

521
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:08,613
周六晚上你做什么？         共进晚餐好吗？
What are you doing Saturday night?  What about dinner?

522
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:11,783
嘿，你要去那？    找6楼J室的朋友
Where you going?    Visiting friends at 6J.

523
01:04:11,859 --> 01:04:13,724
去吧，周六怎么样？
Go ahead，What about Saturday?

524
01:04:13,794 --> 01:04:17,753
晚上8点      我不知道
About 8:00?    I dongt know.

525
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:21,827
你已经有约了？
You got plans?

526
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:29,106
在这里和你会面？
Meet you here?

527
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:46,677
我们知道你忙，所以会尽快
We know you're a busy man，We'll make this short.

528
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:50,689
请你详细地说出当天的情形
If you'll just take us step-by-step through exactly what happened.

529
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:54,591
那人站在这，取出枪来
The guy was here，He went for his gun.

530
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:56,856
我们就向他开枪
Bang，We shot him.

531
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:03,102
那些孩子当时在那？       我不知道
Where exactly were the kids?  I dongt know!

532
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:05,661
你不认为他们当时应该在学校吗？
They should have been at school，Dongt you think?

533
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:07,673
你的口供说，你是第一个进入现场
Your statement said you were the first man in.

534
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:09,766
你没看见孩子吗？       门给砸坏了
Didngt you see any kids?  The door was broken.

535
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:11,902
发生什么事？  你是否按程序办事？
What happened?   Did you follow the procedure?

536
01:06:14,014 --> 01:06:17,575
我死了个兄弟，你们他妈的要我怎样？
I lost a good man here，What the fuck do you want with me?

537
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:20,085
要你合作
Cooperation.

538
01:06:23,523 --> 01:06:27,425
我没时间回答你们的狗屁问题
I havengt got time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

539
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:32,124
要我合作，到我办公室来，4602号室
You want cooperation? Come up in my office，Room 4602.

540
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,303
小子，回学校去
Kids should be at school.

541
01:06:46,546 --> 01:06:49,140
喂，那是我的篮球
Come on. That's my ball!

542
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:53,710
还给我，你要去那？
Give that back，Where you going?

543
01:06:53,787 --> 01:06:57,223
该死！你去那？那是我的球
Damn! Where you going. Man? That's my ball!

544
01:07:03,964 --> 01:07:05,898
跟着那辆蓝色汽车
Follow the blue car.

545
01:07:05,966 --> 01:07:09,129
你想我和它一样，鸣警号、闯红灯？
You want me to blast the music and go through the lights?

546
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:10,760
不，开慢点
No，Drive slowly.

547
01:07:10,837 --> 01:07:13,635
收下你的车钱，然后闭上你的臭嘴，好吗？
Take the hundred bucks，And shut the fuck up.

548
01:07:45,664 --> 01:07:49,100
我不想和你打  但你必须毫无选择地离开
<i>I do not want to fight you.but you leave me no choice.</i>

549
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:56,037
好孩子  你的想法真妙!
<i>Boy.you just gave me a great idea!</i>

550

送给你的，是礼物

554

How do you like it? Nice. eh?

556
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,042
麦嘉先生？
Mr. McGuffin?

557
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,039
能和你谈谈吗？
Can I have a word with you?

558
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:01,359
拿去，这是2万元酬金，对吗？
Here，It's for a contract.Twenty grand. right?

559
01:10:01,432 --> 01:10:04,424
他叫诺曼史丹菲尔德
His name is Norman Stansfield.

560
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:07,494
在缉毒署4602室，联邦广场26号
and he's in room 4602 in the D.E.A. building，26 Federal Plaza.

561
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:10,931
我不接受          为何？
I'm not taking it.   Why not?

562
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:13,834
我干不了        那好
It's too heavy.   Well.

563
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:15,742
你能把枪借我用一天吗？
Will you rent me your gear for the day?

564
01:10:15,813 --> 01:10:18,441
我从不借出我的枪
I never lend out my gear.

565
01:10:18,516 --> 01:10:20,381
但是…
But...

566
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:22,419
你可以用你自己的枪
you still have your gun.Use it.

567
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,922
帮我个忙，别向窗外乱射，好吗？
Just do me a favor. Dongt shoot out the window.

568
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:28,481
你为何要这样对我？
Why are you so mean to me?

569
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:32,552
你能毫不留情地杀死陌生人…
Wildly killing people you dongt give a shit about...

570
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,327
却不肯帮我报灭门之仇？
but you wongt get the bastards that killed my whole family?

571
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:39,834
复仇不是好事  相信我
Revenge is not good once you're done. Believe.

572
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:43,165
最好是忘记         忘记？
It's better to forget.   Forget?

573
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,232
当我看到弟弟尸体旁的粉笔线后
After I've seen the outline of my brother's body on the floor...

574
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,301
你以为我能忘记？
you expect me to forget?

575
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:50,506
我要杀死那帮狗杂种
I want to kill those sons of bitches.

576
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:52,412
打爆他们的脑袋
Blow their fucking heads off.

577
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:55,452
你杀了人以后 一切都会变了
Nothing's the same after you've killed someone.

578
01:10:57,555 --> 01:11:00,547
你的生活就从此改变了
Your life is changed forever.

579
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:06,028
你的余生都要提心吊胆地过活
You have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of your life.

580
01:11:06,097 --> 01:11:08,793
我不管将来如何，里昂
I dongt give a shit about sleeping，Leon.

581
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,792
我只需要爱…
I want love...

582
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:14,036
或者死
or death.

583
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:16,633
就是这样
That's it.

584
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:20,537
我选择死亡
I want death.

585
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:24,411
别烦我了，玛蒂尔达，我已厌倦了你的游戏
Get off my case， Mathilda，I'm tired of your games.

586
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:30,380
这游戏很有趣，里昂
There's this really great game，Leon.

587
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:33,946
它让人变得和善，让人开始思考
Makes people nicer，Starts them thinking.

588
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:40,663
这是你喜欢的方式
The kind of game you love.

589
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,841
若我羸了…
If I win...

590
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:58,781
你一生都要陪着我
you keep me with you...for life.

591
01:12:00,918 --> 01:12:02,579
若你输呢？
And if you lose?

592
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:06,089
你还是独来独往，一如从前
Go shopping alone，like before.

593
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,650
你输定了，玛蒂尔达
You're gonna lose，Mathilda.

594
01:12:12,263 --> 01:12:15,096
你上满了子弹，我听见了
There's a round in the chamber，I heard it.

595
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,531
那又怎样？
So what?

596
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,660
若我中枪身亡，你会怎样？
What's it to you if I end up with a bullet in the head?

597
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:23,964
若无其事
Nothing.

598
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,041
我希望你没说谎，里昂
I hope you're not lying，Leon.

599
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,681
我也希望你的内心深处，从来没有爱过我
I really hope that deep down inside there's no love in you.

600
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:39,746
因为，如果你有…
Because if there is...

601
01:12:39,823 --> 01:12:43,088
那么一点点爱我的话…
just a little bit of love in there for me...

602
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:48,556
那几分钟后，你会后悔一直没有说出自己的真实感受
I think that in a few minutes you'll regret you never said anything.

603
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:00,433
我爱你，里昂
I love you，Leon.

604
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,927
我羸了
I win.

605
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,814
我受伤了
I took a hit.

606
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,984
现在我需要个帮手
I need a hand now.

607
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:46,148
我知道她还小，但她学得很快
I know she's young，but she learns fast.

608
01:13:46,223 --> 01:13:48,384
小孩需要人去培养，对吗？
Kids need to be shaped into something，right?

609
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:51,724
是的，我是这样说过，但这行有年龄限制的
I know，I taught you that，But aingt there an age limit?

610
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,729
她已经18岁了
She's 18.

611
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,731
是吗？
Really?

612
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:01,301
托尼，来点喝的好吗？
How about something to drink. Tony?

613
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:04,864
当然，马奴洛. 倒杯牛奶给里昂
Sure，Manolo. glass of milk for Leon.

614
01:14:07,411 --> 01:14:09,345
纹身不错
Nice tattoo.

615
01:14:13,984 --> 01:14:17,420
马奴洛，2杯牛奶
Manolo，make that two.

616
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,738
干嘛戴帽子？     防止感冒
What's that for?    Cangt afford to catch cold.

617
01:14:40,778 --> 01:14:42,769
首先，找出门链在那
First you find out where the chain is.

618
01:14:42,846 --> 01:14:46,213
虽然看不见，但你能感觉到，这里
You cangt see it，but you can feel it，Here.

619
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:49,013
我按门铃，你和他说话        说什么？
I'll ring，you start talking.   What do I say?

620
01:14:49,987 --> 01:14:51,818
随便你
Whatever you want.

621
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:55,791
谁？     你好
Yes?        Hi.

622
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:57,793
是苏珊
It's Susan.

623
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:01,092
抱歉，你找错房间了，小姑娘
I'm sorry，You must have the wrong door，little girl.

624
01:15:01,165 --> 01:15:03,565
我不认识什么苏珊
I dongt know any Susan.

625
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:07,695
往后退点，我什么都看不见
Move back a little，I cangt see anything.

626
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:10,365
过道里的灯没开
The light's out.

627
01:15:10,441 --> 01:15:12,375
外面一片漆黑
It's all dark out here.

628
01:15:15,646 --> 01:15:20,140
先生，我很害怕      好吧
Mister. I'm scared.    Okay.

629
01:15:24,822 --> 01:15:27,552
你他妈的想干嘛？
What the fuck are you doing?

630
01:15:32,796 --> 01:15:34,127
张开嘴
Open up.

631
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:38,959
若它离开你的嘴，我就开枪，懂吗？
If it leaves your mouth，I'll pull the trigger，capisce?

632
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:18,771
没问题了，把嘴挪开
Here's okay，Let it go.

633
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:21,208
我说:"把嘴挪开"
I said. '' Let it go.''

634
01:16:21,278 --> 01:16:23,678
走，到那边去
Move. Move over.

635
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,705
别紧张……
Easy. Easy.

636
01:16:26,784 --> 01:16:29,719
小心点，你想要我
Careful.You want me--

637
01:16:31,288 --> 01:16:34,018
上吧，轮到你了
Go ahead，Your turn.

638
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:43,399
救命，求你别打我
Help me.Please dongt beat me.

639
01:16:43,467 --> 01:16:45,072
先生？
Sir?

640
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,680
先生？
Sir?

641
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:51,165
先生，那些白粉不是我的
Sir. it's not my dope.

642
01:16:51,241 --> 01:16:53,209
先生，看我…
Sir. look I…

643
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:55,211
往左边一点
A little left. please.

644
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,239
开枪之前
Before-- Ple--

645
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,821
现在，再开一枪，确保目标死亡
Now，the security shot.

646
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:13,824
不，第二枪要打在胸口上方
No，the second goes higher on the chest.

647
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:16,263
瞄准心肺的部位
Aim for the heart and lungs.

648
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,358
那里 就是那里，懂吗？
There. Right there.You see?

649
01:17:18,435 --> 01:17:20,369
第一枪让目标失态
The first shot takes him out of order.

650
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:23,338
第二枪解决他           你们他妈的在干嘛？
The second finishes him off.  What are you fucking doing?

651
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:24,897
千万别打脸
Never in the face.

652
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:28,206
若目标无法确认，你就拿不到酬金
If they cangt recognize the client，you dongt get paid.

653
01:17:28,278 --> 01:17:31,941
因为你能随便找个人来作替死鬼
You could take out anybody and said you did the job.

654
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:34,711
明白了？  明白了，千万别打脸
Got it?    Got it，Never in the face.

655
01:17:34,785 --> 01:17:38,243
好，把枪收起来           他妈的，你们想干嘛？
Now you can put the tools away.What are you fucking doing?

656
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:40,620
他妈的，你们想干嘛？ 嘿，先生！
What the fuck is going on?  Hey. mister!

657
01:17:40,691 --> 01:17:43,216
该死的
What are you fuckin--

658
01:17:46,263 --> 01:17:48,925
你看 若经常使用消音器…
You see. when you use the silencer a lot...

659
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:51,263
你要在这里放一块布…
you have to put a piece of cloth here...

660
01:17:51,335 --> 01:17:54,236
因为过热可能走火
because it gets very hot and could burn it inside.

661
01:17:54,304 --> 01:17:57,034
用湿布 最好是黑色的湿布
A damp. black cloth is the best.

662
01:18:00,377 --> 01:18:02,311
你在干嘛？
What you doing?

663
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:05,610
我们说好不杀妇孺和小孩
We said no women. no kids.

664
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:09,379
你以为毒品只会杀死瘾君子吗？
Who do you think this is gonna kill.junkies and monkeys?

665
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:27,266
现在，干净了
Now it's clean.

666
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:31,136
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

667
01:18:44,588 --> 01:18:46,522
我想我们不该喝酒
I thought we dongt have the right to drink.

668
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:50,754
我知道，为你第一次当杀手破个例吧
I know，but we're making an exception for your first time.

669
01:18:52,863 --> 01:18:58,199
既然，我们是在庆祝完成任务…
Well，if we're making exceptions for a job well-done...

670
01:18:58,268 --> 01:19:02,102
那就像电影里一样，吻我一下如何？
how about a kiss，like in the movies?

671
01:19:05,776 --> 01:19:07,710
好吧
Yes.

672
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:10,508
 你想干嘛？
What you doing?

673
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:13,049
我要吻你     拜托你停下来
I'm going to kiss you.I want you to stop. please.

674
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,949
来吧，只是吻一下
Come on，Just a kiss.

675
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:19,352
停下，别人在看着我们
Stop，Everyone is watching us.

676
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:24,226
回位子上坐下
Go sit down.

677
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:33,335
好好享受
Enjoy.

678
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:41,810
你不相信我  是吗？      什么事？
You dongt believe me. do you?How's that?

679
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:46,906
我说爱你的时候          玛蒂尔达，忘记它
When I say I'm in love with you.Mathilda. please drop it.

680
01:19:46,984 --> 01:19:50,784
换个话题，好吗？         好吧，对不起
Just change the subject，okay?Okay，Sorry.

681
01:19:52,089 --> 01:19:56,116
先生，你第一次杀人时多少岁？
So. how old were you when you made your first hit?

682
01:19:56,193 --> 01:19:58,753
19岁
Nineteen.

683
01:19:58,829 --> 01:20:00,763
那我羸了你
Beat you.

684
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:09,665
你干嘛？       我也不能感冒
What you doing?  Cangt afford to catch a cold.

685
01:21:56,379 --> 01:22:00,213
没有门铃          那敲门吧
There's no doorbell.So knock on the door.

686
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:06,879
谁？         嗨
Yes?          Hi.

687
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:09,291
我在找瑞本先生的房间…
I'm looking for Mr. Reubengs apartment...

688
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,125
但走廊一片漆黑，我也迷路了
but it's all dark out here in the hall. and I'm lost.

689
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:15,130
等一下
Just a second.

690
01:22:27,244 --> 01:22:30,577
还要吗？来啊，让我看看你的真面目
You want more? Come on，Show your fucking face.

691
01:22:30,647 --> 01:22:33,411
你们以为可以轻易干掉我？
You think you're going to get me that easily?

692
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:41,322
遇到这种情况 就尽快采取一些手段
When it's tough like this. you know it's gonna be ugly.

693
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:45,521
除非你想整天站在这里听他鬼叫
<i>Better make it quick or else we'll be all day listening to his crap.</i>

694
01:22:45,595 --> 01:22:48,359
杂种! 来啊，让我看看你他妈的脸，笨蛋！
Asshole! Come on,show me your fucking face. faggot!

695
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,763
来啊，小把戏         嘿
Come on，gum trick.   Hey.

696
01:22:52,002 --> 01:22:54,368
嘿，那拉环的把戏怎样？你听说过吗？
What about the ring trick? You know that one?

697
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,905
拉环的把戏？来啊，杂种，我等着，快来啊
Ring trick? Come on，asshole，I'm waiting.

698
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:58,907
做给我看看混蛋
Show it to me. motherfucker.

699
01:23:07,918 --> 01:23:10,853
这就是拉环的把戏
That's the ring trick.

700
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:28,797
马里奥，回理发店去，晚点再来
Mario，go back to the barbershop，We'll finish later.

701
01:23:39,916 --> 01:23:43,215
里昂，怎样了？都解决了吗？
Leon，what's up? All done already?

702
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:49,081
比人更友善，对吗？
Nicer than people，eh?

703
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:51,093
是我告诉你的
I told you that.

704
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:55,264
你遇上麻烦了？        没有
You got a problem?       No

705
01:23:58,134 --> 01:24:00,102
拿张椅子  坐下
Get the chair. Sit down.

706
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:09,267
我在想
I was thinking.

707
01:24:11,948 --> 01:24:15,611
如果，有天我出事了
If something happens to me someday--

708
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:19,519
嘿，里昂，你不会出事的
Hey，Leon，nothing's gonna happen to you.

709
01:24:19,589 --> 01:24:22,558
你有金刚之躯，你刀枪不入
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you. You play with 'em.

710
01:24:22,626 --> 01:24:26,756
托尼，我是说我那笔钱
Tony，I thought about my money.

711
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:35,529
你记得那天和我一起来的小女孩吗？         记得
You remember the girl who came here the other day?   Yes

712
01:24:39,976 --> 01:24:44,879
她叫玛蒂尔达
Her name is Mathilda.

713
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:48,247
若我遭遇不测…
If anything happens to me...

714
01:24:48,318 --> 01:24:52,516
我要你…
I'd like you...

715
01:24:54,024 --> 01:24:56,458
把我的钱…
to give her...

716
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:00,789
都给她
my money.

717
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:05,727
包在我身上，里昂
You can count on me，Leon.

718
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:08,236
谢谢，托尼
Thank you，Tony.

719
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:13,472
我出去一下
I wongt be long.

720
01:25:14,945 --> 01:25:17,914
我做错什么了？      没有
Did I do something wrong?    No.

721
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:22,018
这次是笔大生意
This one is too big.

722
01:25:22,752 --> 01:25:26,119
是的 我只能做小生意，对吧？
Yeah. and I only get the leftovers，is that it?

723
01:25:28,024 --> 01:25:30,356
玛蒂尔达，自从我遇上你之后…
Mathilda，since I met you...

724
01:25:30,427 --> 01:25:32,554
一切都和以前不同了
everything's been different.

725
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:37,166
我只是想，一个人静一段时间
So I just need some time alone.

726
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:41,927
你也需要时间成长
You need some time to grow up a little.

727
01:25:42,005 --> 01:25:44,701
我早就成熟了 里昂
I finished growing up. Leon.

728
01:25:44,774 --> 01:25:46,605
现在只有年龄在长
I just get older.

729
01:25:46,676 --> 01:25:50,134
但我恰恰相反，我年纪大了
For me it's the opposite，I'm old enough.

730
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:53,906
我需要时间变得更成熟
I need time to grow up.

731
01:26:08,999 --> 01:26:10,990
妈的
Shit.

732
01:27:26,076 --> 01:27:28,476
传球，快！
Come on! Hustle!

733
01:27:30,547 --> 01:27:32,378
好球      继续
Good shot.  Come on.

734
01:27:35,652 --> 01:27:38,280
你是新来的？住在5楼，对吗？
You're new. arengt you? Fifth floor. right?

735
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:41,281
你不能坐在这           真的？为何？
You cangt sit here like that.   Really. why not?

736
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:43,825
没有免费的午餐，就像停车场
Nothing's free，Like a parking meter.

737
01:27:43,893 --> 01:27:46,862
你停车就要付钱，这是规矩
When you stop. you pay. It's the law.

738
01:27:46,996 --> 01:27:49,055
像在电视上         你说什么？
Only on T.V.        What'd you say?

739
01:27:49,165 --> 01:27:52,692
算了，要多少钱？           10块钱
Forget it，How much is your meter?   Ten dollars...

740
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:54,430
一个月
a month.

741
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,570
有钱找吗？
Got change?

742
01:28:00,076 --> 01:28:02,374
别担心，我可以先付一年
Dongt worry about it，We'll do ten for twelve.

743
01:28:02,445 --> 01:28:04,675
这是今年的，好吗？
I'll pay now for the rest of the year.

744
01:28:04,747 --> 01:28:06,237
好吧，一年
Okay，a year.

745
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,177
我交了钱  还得忍受你们？           不
Does paying rent here mean I have to put up with you guys?

746
01:28:13,356 --> 01:28:15,847
那就到别的地方去玩
So go play somewhere else.

747
01:28:19,262 --> 01:28:21,594
我要静静地思考
I need to think.

748
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:22,418
站好，喜欢你的工作吗？
Stand up，Dongt you like your job?

749
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:33,267
食物
Food.

750
01:29:36,773 --> 01:29:41,506
你要去哪？    送外卖，4602房
Where you going?  Special delivery，room 4602.

751
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:43,238
签个名
Sign here.

752
01:29:43,313 --> 01:29:44,837
这边
Come here.

753
01:29:47,517 --> 01:29:51,578
周末玩得开心点，姑娘们     谢谢
Have a nice weekend，girls.   Thanks.

754
01:29:51,654 --> 01:29:53,588
我要去洗手间
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

755
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:15,636
送外卖？
Special delivery?

756
01:31:15,705 --> 01:31:17,639
让我猜猜看
Let me guess.

757
01:31:19,809 --> 01:31:21,276
中国菜？
Chinese?

758
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,444
还是泰国菜？
Thai. maybe?

759
01:31:29,118 --> 01:31:31,951
我知道了
I've got it.

760
01:31:32,021 --> 01:31:34,251
是意大利菜
Italian food.

761
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:52,807
你叫什么名字，小天使？     玛蒂尔达
What's your name，angel?      Mathilda

762
01:32:22,839 --> 01:32:26,002
小天使，把纸袋放在地上
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

763
01:32:31,447 --> 01:32:32,880
很好
Good.

764
01:32:35,518 --> 01:32:40,581
然后你要告诉我，有关意大利菜的事
Now I want you to tell me everything you know about Italian food.

765
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:43,557
还有特地为我准备这道菜厨师的名字
Dongt forget the name of the chef who fixed it for me.

766
01:32:43,626 --> 01:32:48,256
没人指使我的，我独自来报仇的
Nobody sent me，I do business for myself.

767
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,634
那么这就是…
So this is something...

768
01:32:54,537 --> 01:32:56,971
私人恩怨，对吗？
personal，is it?

769
01:33:00,977 --> 01:33:05,073
我又干了什么…
What filthy piece of shit...

770
01:33:05,147 --> 01:33:07,081
该死的事情吗？
did I do now?

771
01:33:07,149 --> 01:33:10,414
你杀了我弟弟
You killed my brother.

772
01:33:14,357 --> 01:33:16,291
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

773
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:27,295
你想去陪他？          不
And you wanna join him?

774
01:33:31,274 --> 01:33:34,937
总是这样的
It's always the same thing.

775
01:33:39,348 --> 01:33:44,251
当死亡，让你感到恐惧时…
It's when you start to become really afraid of death...

776
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,881
你才会懂得珍惜生命
that you learn to appreciate life.

777
01:33:47,957 --> 01:33:52,326
你喜欢生命吗？甜心
Do you like life. sweetheart?

778
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:00,634
喜欢       好极了
That's good.

779
01:34:05,575 --> 01:34:09,511
我为我没有兴趣…
Because I take no pleasure...

780
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,247
去杀一个
in taking a life...

781
01:34:14,317 --> 01:34:19,277
不珍惜生命的人…
if it's from a person who doesngt care about it.

782
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:32,259
史丹，我到处在找你
Stan，I've been looking all over for you.

783
01:34:32,335 --> 01:34:35,634
楼上楼下都找过了  什么事？我很忙
I checked upstairs--What? I'm busy.

784
01:34:35,705 --> 01:34:38,538
迈基死了
It's Malky. man.He's dead.

785
01:34:40,743 --> 01:34:44,008
迈基正和中国人交易
Malky was making a buy for us from the Chinaman.

786
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,913
但这与中国人无关
<i>But they got nothing to do with it.</i>

787
01:34:46,983 --> 01:34:52,853
他们说，有人闯进来，是个职业杀手
<i>They told me this guy came from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

788
01:34:52,922 --> 01:34:56,016
身手敏捷，神出鬼没
<i>He was fast，He fuckingcame out of nowhere.</i>

789
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:59,027
两秒钟就干掉了那些中国人
<i>Boom. shoots the Chinaman dead in two seconds.</i>

790
01:34:59,095 --> 01:35:02,690
等等，我是警察
Easy. man.I'm a cop.

791
01:35:02,765 --> 01:35:05,666
他转过身，对迈基说
Then turns around，says something to Malky like--

792
01:35:05,735 --> 01:35:07,896
不杀女人和小孩子
No women. no kids.

793
01:35:15,911 --> 01:35:18,744
我认为是私人恩怨
I think it was something personal.

794
01:35:20,116 --> 01:35:25,418
现在，生死真是反复无常
Death is whimsical today.

795
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:56,178
血  你听见没？
Blood. do you hear me?

796
01:35:56,252 --> 01:36:00,689
是，我听到了.  史丹，放松点
Yeah，I hear you.  Stan，Just chill out. man.

797
01:36:00,756 --> 01:36:03,190
带她去我办公室好吗？
Would you take her up to my office?

798
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,452
好的
All right.

799
01:36:14,804 --> 01:36:16,931
吓死人了
Jesus fucking Christ.

800
01:36:29,251 --> 01:36:30,684
里昂，我的爱人
<i>''Leon，my love.</i>

801
01:36:30,753 --> 01:36:33,221
我知道杀死我弟弟的人在哪里
<i>I know where to find the guys who killed my brother.</i>

802
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:37,988
他们的头叫诺曼・史丹，他在缉毒署4602室
<i>Their boss is Norman Stansfiield，He's in the D.E.A. building. room 4602.</i>

803
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,028
我要亲手杀他们
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

804
01:36:40,096 --> 01:36:43,896
若我出事了，桌上有2万元
<i>If something goes wrong，I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

805
01:36:43,966 --> 01:36:47,925
那是给你的酬金，杀一个人5000，对吗？
<i>It's for a contract,Five grand a head,right?</i>

806
01:36:48,003 --> 01:36:51,905
解决了这件事，我心里才会舒服
<i>I know I'll feel better after I do this.</i>

807
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:53,908
我爱你 玛蒂尔达
<i>I love you. Mathilda ''</i>

808
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:00,812
等我一下，很快就好
Wait,I wongt be long.

809
01:37:00,883 --> 01:37:04,148
这是联邦大楼，门口禁止停车
I cangt in front like this,It's a federal building!

810
01:37:08,724 --> 01:37:12,091
他的反应就如我预料
He's gonna do the same exact thing that I said.

811
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:14,755
9毫米口径的手枪
A nine ''millie.''

812
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:16,957
子弹
Bullets.

813
01:37:17,032 --> 01:37:18,465
又一把9毫米手枪
Another nine ''millie.''

814
01:37:21,904 --> 01:37:23,929
你打算用这些枪干嘛？
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?

815
01:37:24,006 --> 01:37:26,975
也许，她想杀光整座大楼的人
Maybe she was planning on taking out the whole building.

816
01:37:31,147 --> 01:37:32,978
妈的！
Holy shit!

817
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:34,709
这是什么？午餐？
What's this? Lunch.

818
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:39,412
小心，可能有毒
Careful. Blood.might be poisoned.

819
01:37:39,488 --> 01:37:41,479
不会，吃完了再说
There's no anchovies on this.

820
01:37:58,908 --> 01:38:02,674
你说不会太久，但我等了10分钟
Is that what you call ''I wongt be long''? I been here for ten minutes.

821
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,441
我已经尽快了，开车吧
I did my best.

822
01:38:53,128 --> 01:38:54,618
你喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

823
01:38:56,465 --> 01:38:57,659
喜欢
Yes.

824
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,291
再说一次
So say it.

825
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,261
我喜欢
I like it.

826
01:39:19,154 --> 01:39:20,485
你不渴吗？
Not thirsty?

827
01:39:29,899 --> 01:39:32,959
你知道，女孩子的第一次很重要
You know，a girl's first time is very important.

828
01:39:33,035 --> 01:39:36,129
可能影响她的一生
It determines the rest of her life sexually.

829
01:39:36,205 --> 01:39:39,333
我在姐姐的书上看来的
I read that once in one of my sister's magazines.

830
01:39:39,608 --> 01:39:43,044
我朋友们说，她们讨厌第一次性体验
My girlfriends told me they hated their first experience.

831
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:47,477
那是因为，她们并不喜欢对方
That's because they didngt love the guys.

832
01:39:48,851 --> 01:39:50,910
她们做爱是为了炫耀
They just did it to show off.

833
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:54,786
然后 她们开始喜欢做爱，就像抽烟一样
Afterwards. they started liking it，like cigarettes.

834
01:39:58,894 --> 01:40:01,488
我的第一次会满意吗？
Will I like it the first time?

835
01:40:05,634 --> 01:40:07,625
玛蒂尔达，不
Mathilda，no.

836
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:11,562
为什么？
Why not?

837
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:14,169
我不能
I just cangt.

838
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,701
你爱着别人？       不
You love someone else?  No.

839
01:40:18,647 --> 01:40:20,478
我的意思是
I mean--

840
01:40:23,986 --> 01:40:26,682
很久以前我爱过一个人
There was someone a long time ago.

841
01:40:27,923 --> 01:40:30,255
那时我还没有来美国
Before I came to the States.

842
01:40:30,759 --> 01:40:34,024
她父亲不准她见我
Her father didngt want her to see me.

843
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:38,288
她出身高贵的家庭
She was from a very respectable family.

844
01:40:39,535 --> 01:40:41,025
而我…
Mine was...

845
01:40:41,837 --> 01:40:43,668
你知道…
you know...

846
01:40:45,407 --> 01:40:47,068
出身贫寒
not so respectable.

847
01:40:47,142 --> 01:40:51,010
所以每次她来见我，她爸就会发怒
Her dad went nuts every time she'd take off to see me.

848
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,412
她仍然偷偷来见你，对吗？
She still snuck off to see you，right?

849
01:40:55,184 --> 01:40:56,549
对
Right.

850
01:40:56,618 --> 01:40:59,018
看，爱情是无法阻挡的，里昂
See，nothing can stop love，Leon.

851
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:03,481
他杀了她
He killed her.

852
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,286
一枪击中她头部
One shot through the head.

853
01:41:09,798 --> 01:41:14,030
他在监狱呆了两天，就放出来了
They kept him in jail for two days，and they let him go free.

854
01:41:15,938 --> 01:41:18,133
他们说这是意外
They said it was an accident.

855
01:41:20,309 --> 01:41:21,799
所以…
So...

856
01:41:23,512 --> 01:41:25,639
一天晚上…
one night I...

857
01:41:26,015 --> 01:41:28,006
我等着他
waited for him.

858
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:31,751
带着狙击枪，在500英尺的距离
Five hundred feet with a lens.

859
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:36,421
他也遇上了"意外"
He also had an accident.

860
01:41:37,693 --> 01:41:41,356
那晚我坐船来到这里…
The same night I took a boat and came here...

861
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:45,560
见到了我父亲，他为托尼工作
to meet up with my father who was working for Tony.

862
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:48,333
那时我19岁
I was 19.

863
01:41:51,774 --> 01:41:55,574
从此以后，我再也没有离开过这座城市，而且…
Since then I've never left the city，and...

864
01:41:59,248 --> 01:42:01,614
我也没有再交女朋友
I've never had another girlfriend.

865
01:42:04,653 --> 01:42:07,281
你看，玛蒂尔达…
You see，Mathilda...

866
01:42:07,356 --> 01:42:09,415
我不是一个好情人
I wouldngt be a good lover.

867
01:42:11,794 --> 01:42:13,455
好吧
Okay.

868
01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:18,795
你能帮我个忙吗？
Would you do me one favor?

869
01:42:18,867 --> 01:42:20,357
什么？
What?

870
01:42:20,436 --> 01:42:22,836
我讨厌你睡在沙发上
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

871
01:42:22,905 --> 01:42:25,066
我们要同床共枕
We're gonna share the bed.

872
01:42:26,008 --> 01:42:28,340
这不认为这是个好主意
I dongt think it's a good idea.

873
01:42:29,711 --> 01:42:31,611
好了
It's okay.

874
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,078
把腿放在床上
Put your legs up on the bed.

875
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:36,208
对，很好
Yeah，That's nice.

876
01:42:40,622 --> 01:42:43,022
把头放低，好的，放松
Put your head down，It's okay，Relax.

877
01:43:04,746 --> 01:43:06,737
晚安，里昂
Good night，Leon.

878
01:43:09,651 --> 01:43:11,482
晚安
Good night.

879
01:43:34,009 --> 01:43:36,204
先给我块蛋糕
I want a piece of cake first!

880
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:45,448
马奴洛，带孩子们去厨房
Manolo，take the kids in the kitchen.

881
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,609
我一直很尊敬你，托尼
I have a lot of respect for your business，Tony.

882
01:44:07,676 --> 01:44:10,270
你过去帮我们杀人…
When you've killed for us in the past...

883
01:44:10,345 --> 01:44:13,837
我们很满意
we've always been satisfied.

884
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:19,513
但今天发生的事让我为难
That's exactly why today is going to be very hard for me.

885
01:44:19,588 --> 01:44:21,522
希望你谅解我的心情
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

886
01:44:25,727 --> 01:44:29,720
我的人，在你的地盘被杀
My man was killed right here on your turf.

887
01:44:29,798 --> 01:44:32,892
中国人说那杀手…
The Chinks tell me that the hit man...

888
01:44:32,968 --> 01:44:36,802
像是意大利人
was kind of the Italian type.

889
01:44:36,872 --> 01:44:40,706
所以我们想 托尼可能知道些什么
So we figured that Tony might know something.

890
01:44:40,776 --> 01:44:43,244
等等，下面要说的
Wait，There's more.

891
01:44:43,312 --> 01:44:45,439
也许你会感兴趣
You're gonna love this.

892
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:53,153
几小时后，一个12岁的小女孩走进我办公室…
A few hours later，a little 1 2-year-old girl comes into my office...

893
01:44:53,222 --> 01:44:57,989
武装到牙齿，抱着必死的决心要把我关进停尸间
armed to the teeth. with the firm intention of sending me to the morgue.

894
01:44:58,060 --> 01:45:01,826
你知道是谁把她救走吗？
Do you know who came and got her right there in my building?

895
01:45:03,098 --> 01:45:05,293
就是这个…
The very same...

896
01:45:05,367 --> 01:45:07,460
意大利杀手
Italian hit man.

897
01:45:12,107 --> 01:45:14,541
我很想和他见面
I'm dying to meet him.

898
01:45:19,214 --> 01:45:23,583
放松点，一切都很好，睡得好吗？
Relax，Everything's fine，Sleep well?

899
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:27,816
我很少睡得好，永远睁着一只眼睡觉
I never really sleep，Got one eye open always.

900
01:45:27,889 --> 01:45:29,880
噢，我忘了
Yeah，I forgot.

901
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:32,893
我从没见过有人睁着眼睛睡觉、还打鼾呢
I never saw someone with one eye open snore so much.

902
01:45:34,429 --> 01:45:37,398
我打鼾吗？    就像个婴儿
I snore?     Like a baby.

903
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:42,027
我去买点牛奶作早餐，很快就回来
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast，I wongt be long.

904
01:45:42,104 --> 01:45:43,969
回来记得敲暗号
Dongt forget the code when you come back.

905
01:45:44,039 --> 01:45:46,564
两下、一下、再两下，对吗？
Two knocks、then one、and two knocks again，Right?

906
01:45:46,642 --> 01:45:48,075
对
Right.

907
01:46:08,463 --> 01:46:11,398
这些先放这里，我还要买点牛奶
Ring these up，I'm gonna go get some milk.

908
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,688
从现在起，不准出声
From here on out，you dongt make a sound.

909
01:46:33,755 --> 01:46:37,691
你点头或摇头来回答我的问题，懂吗？
<i>You answer my questions by nodding yes or shaking your head no.</i>

910
01:46:37,759 --> 01:46:40,319
他独自一人？
Is he alone?

911
01:46:40,395 --> 01:46:42,590
他在等你回去？
Does he expect you?

912
01:46:42,664 --> 01:46:45,861
你有房间的钥匙吗？
Do you have keys to the apartment?

913
01:46:45,934 --> 01:46:49,199
有敲门的暗号吗 让他知道是你？
Is there a code. a way of knocking.so he knows it's you?

914
01:47:37,285 --> 01:47:38,684
A队，准备行动
Alpha team.

915
01:47:38,754 --> 01:47:42,349
收到  准备行动           小心
<i>Final position. We're ready to go.Be careful.</i>

916
01:48:29,404 --> 01:48:32,567
怎么了？ 快！  混蛋
What up? Move! Fuck.

917
01:48:37,913 --> 01:48:39,744
妈的
Shit.

918
01:48:41,183 --> 01:48:43,174
A队，有人死了
Alpha team，Man down.

919
01:48:44,419 --> 01:48:46,546
我警告过你们的
I told you.

920
01:48:50,425 --> 01:48:53,189
把所有人都叫来  “所有人”指什么？
Bring me everyone. What do you mean，''everyone''?

921
01:48:53,261 --> 01:48:55,729
所有的人！
Everyone!

922
01:49:49,551 --> 01:49:51,485
拿着
Take this.

923
01:49:57,325 --> 01:50:00,419
上前看看
Go take a look.

924
01:50:14,442 --> 01:50:17,809
不准动     你看到什么？
Dongt move.  Do you see anything?

925
01:50:19,681 --> 01:50:23,617
是那个家伙，他在这，正用枪指着我的头
It's the guy，He's here，He's got a gun to my head.

926
01:50:26,721 --> 01:50:28,245
不要轻举妄动
Nobody moves.

927
01:50:28,323 --> 01:50:31,190
把女孩放了     冷静一点，朋友
Let the girl go. Take it easy，man!

928
01:50:33,662 --> 01:50:37,098
好的，女孩过来了放了她
Okay，the girl's coming out.Let the girl go.

929
01:50:47,175 --> 01:50:50,474
把墙上的斧头拿下来，就在那，快去
Grab the axe off the wall，Over there，Go!

930
01:50:53,815 --> 01:50:55,874
跟我走
You're coming with us.

931
01:51:08,129 --> 01:51:09,892
妈的，他杀了人质
Christ，he shot him!

932
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:13,801
杂种！
Bastard!

933
01:51:22,877 --> 01:51:24,310
散开、散开、散开
Move!

934
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:30,477
把水龙头关上       知道了
Shut the fucking water off!  Got it.

935
01:51:30,552 --> 01:51:32,679
走
Come!

936
01:51:33,822 --> 01:51:37,519
我们处境不妙，请求支援
We're in a bad way here，Send the cats.

937

I dongt know what happened，I didngt see 'em coming，I swear!

938
01:51:51,406 --> 01:51:56,969

I just went shopping and I came back，and they were everywhere.

939
01:51:58,747 --> 01:52:00,874
离窗口远点
Stay away from the window.

940

How are we gonna get outta here now?Leave it to me，We're checking out.

944
01:54:20,655 --> 01:54:24,284
但是这对你来说太窄了，我才勉强能挤进去
But it's not big enough for you，It's barely big enough for me.

We said no discussion.  No，I'm not letting--

I'm not going! I wongt go!  Listen to me.

We have no chance together，But if I'm alone. I can do it.

I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

950

We'll take it and leave together.just the two of us.Okay?

951
01:54:45,013 --> 01:54:46,503
走吧

952
01:54:46,581 --> 01:54:49,880
不  你这样说是为了安慰我
You're saying that so I wongt worry.

953

我不想失去你      你不会失去我的
I dongt wanna lose you.  You're not gonna lose me.

You've given me a taste for life.

Hey，what is going on up there? Take the guy out，not the building.

963
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:35,548

968

把他带下楼梯
Get that guy off the stairs!

969

Move your fucking asses.

973

第1组，公寓里情况如何？
<i>Squad Number One，what's the status on the apartment?</i>

<i>Cangt see shit，Too much smoke，Give us five minutes.</i>

What? Two hundred men cangt find one man and a girl?

977
01:57:43,324 --> 01:57:44,882

这是   来自
This is from...

992
02:01:50,071 --> 02:01:52,335
玛蒂尔达…
Mathilda…

993
02:02:07,421 --> 02:02:09,286
妈的
Shit.

994

快从这里出去！
Get out of here!

995

里昂让我帮你…
Leon asked me to help you out...

996
02:02:38,486 --> 02:02:42,422
若他出事的话 我想他出事了对吗？
if something happened，and I think something happened.

997
02:02:42,490 --> 02:02:46,256
他留下一点钱给你
He put aside a little cash for you.

998
02:02:46,327 --> 02:02:49,490
所以我建议…
So what I'm suggesting is that...

999
02:02:49,563 --> 02:02:52,031
因为你还小…
seeing as how you're still so young...

1000
02:02:52,099 --> 02:02:55,034
钱我帮你保管，到你长大为止
I should hold the money for you until you're older.

1001
02:02:55,102 --> 02:02:57,229
就像银行，你知道，除…
Like a bank，you know，except...

1002
02:02:57,305 --> 02:03:01,366
但我比银行更好，因为银行会被打劫
it's better than a bank'cause banks always get knocked off.

1003
02:03:01,442 --> 02:03:04,138
而没人敢打劫托尼
No one knocks off old Tony.

1004
02:03:04,211 --> 02:03:06,873
这是你的钱，在这段期间…
But it's your money，In the meantime...

1005
02:03:06,947 --> 02:03:10,883
你可以时不时来一趟
all you gotta do is come here every once in awhile...

1006
02:03:10,951 --> 02:03:14,717
然后我就给你一点钱拿去花，好吗？…
and I'll dish it out so you can have a little fun.

1007
02:03:15,856 --> 02:03:17,289
这里
Here.

1008
02:03:17,358 --> 02:03:22,853
先拿100块去花吧        不能给我份工作吗？
Here's a hundred bucks to start. Cangt I get a job instead?

1009
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:27,867
工作？你能干什么？
Ajob? What the hell can you do?

1010
02:03:27,935 --> 02:03:29,766
我能杀人
I can clean.

1011
02:03:31,138 --> 02:03:33,606
我没有适合12岁小孩的工作
I aingt got no work for a 1 2-year-old kid...

1012
02:03:33,674 --> 02:03:35,767
不要再妄想了…
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1013
02:03:35,843 --> 02:03:38,573
结束了，游戏结束了
It's over! The game's over!

1014
02:03:38,646 --> 02:03:41,376
里昂已经死了
Leongs dead!

1015
02:03:41,449 --> 02:03:43,417
你明白吗？
You hear me?

1016
02:03:50,624 --> 02:03:55,357
好了，你以为我不伤心吗？
Come on，You think I aingt hurting too?

1017
02:04:00,835 --> 02:04:03,235
但他死了
But he's dead.

1018
02:04:03,304 --> 02:04:07,263
你必须把这疯狂的一切忘掉，然后回学校去吧
You're gonna forget all this craziness and get your little ass back to school.

1019
02:04:08,509 --> 02:04:11,603
拿着钱，离开这里
Now take this money and get the hell outta here.

1020
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:13,772
下个月之前不要让我看你的脸…
Dongt let me see your face till next month...

1021
02:04:13,848 --> 02:04:18,114
因为我有名的好脾气已经快被你耗尽了
'cause something tells me I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1022
02:05:09,370 --> 02:05:12,828
我的父母…
My parents...

1023
02:05:12,907 --> 02:05:15,000
都死了…
died...

1024
02:05:15,075 --> 02:05:19,671
4周前，死于一场车祸…
in a car accident four weeks ago.

1025
02:05:19,747 --> 02:05:21,681
太可怕了
It was terrible.

1026
02:05:24,251 --> 02:05:28,017
你刚来时，我们没时间了解对方…
We didngt have the time to get to know one another when you first came here...

1027
02:05:28,088 --> 02:05:32,821
但我要你明白，我从不放弃挽救孩子…
but I want you to know I'm not the kind of woman who'd let down a child...

1028
02:05:32,893 --> 02:05:36,226
无论她出什么事，无论她犯什么错
whatever her situation，whatever her mistake.

1029
02:05:36,297 --> 02:05:41,360
我会尽力帮你的，欢迎你回来
So I'm going to help you and do my best to welcome you here again.

1030
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:45,932
但有个条件:
But on one condition:

1031
02:05:46,006 --> 02:05:49,203
你不能再对我说谎了，玛蒂尔达
You have to stop lying to me，Mathilda.

1032
02:05:49,276 --> 02:05:51,437
我希望你能信任我…
I want you to take a chance...

1033
02:05:51,512 --> 02:05:54,447
相信我
and trust me.

1034
02:05:54,515 --> 02:05:57,040
告诉我究竟发生了什么事？
Tell me what happened to you.

1035
02:06:00,454 --> 02:06:03,548
我的父母因为毒品案…
My family got shot down by D.E.A. officers...

1036
02:06:03,624 --> 02:06:07,060
被缉毒署的人杀了
because of a drug problem.

1037
02:06:07,127 --> 02:06:09,721
我遇上了最好的人
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1038
02:06:09,797 --> 02:06:14,564
他还是最棒的杀手，但他今早死了
He was a hit man. the best in town,but he died this morning.

1039
02:06:14,635 --> 02:06:18,503
你不帮我的话，今晚我也会死的
If you dongt help me,I'll be dead by tonight.

你们认识她吗？ 不认识
You know her?  I've never seen her.
