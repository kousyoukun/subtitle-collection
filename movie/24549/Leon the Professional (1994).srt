(IN DEEP VOICE) Yes, this is she.

Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,

181
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,744
he told us she had "problems."

there is very little we can do.

Now, Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

I know your husband paid
tuition in advance for a year,

187
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,010
but if you will refer to Page 20

in the rules and regulations

you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence,

190
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,435
your tuition will be forfeit.

But they smell like shit.

330
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,605
Not true.

331
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:12,526
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen,

332
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,487
that's very clean,

333
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,447
and smells very nice.

334
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,365
You don't have
a pig in your kitchen.

335
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,036
Yes, I do.

336
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,289
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamn pig.

337
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,000
Don't move.
I'll get him.

338
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,963
Piggy, Piggy,
where are you?

339
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,716
There you are.

340
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,551
(LEON SNORTING)

341
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,309
Hi, Mathilda.

342
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,811
Hi, Piggy.

343
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,781
How are you today?

344
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,867
I've seen better days.

345
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,918
What's your name?

346
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,754
Leon.

347
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,342
Cute name.

348
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,426
(CHOKING)

349
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,978
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

350
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,284
I'm gonna get
some more milk.

351
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,470
Holy shit.

352
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,520
Don't touch that, please.

353
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,566
Leon, what exactly do
you do for a living?

354
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,027
Cleaner.

355
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,531
You mean you're
a hit man?

356
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:23,824
Yeah.

357
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,577
Cool.

358
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,841
Do you clean anyone?

359
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,218
No women, no kids.
That's the rules.

360
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:48,849
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags who killed my brother?

361
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,435
Five grand a head.

362
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,561
Wow.

363
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:57,358
How about this?
I work for you,

364
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:01,362
and in exchange, you teach
me how to clean?

365
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,448
What do you think?

366
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,742
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

367
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,952
I'll even wash your clothes.

368
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,915
Is it a deal?

369
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,625
No, it's not a deal.

370
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,887
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

371
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,891
You've had
a rough day today.

372
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,189
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow. Okay?

373
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,206
You've been really
great with me, Leon,

374
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,542
and it's not always like that.

375
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,752
You know?

376
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,679
Good night.

377
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,206
(SIGHING)

378
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,884
Sleep well? Good.

379
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,886
Because after breakfast
you got to take off.

380
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,970
Where to?

381
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,388
Not my problem.

382
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,031
Read it.

383
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,623
You don't know how to read.

384
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:05,462
I'm learning, but I've had a lot of work lately,
so I'm a little behind.

385
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,297
What's it say?

386
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:11,176
I've decided what to do with my life.
I want to be a cleaner.

387
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:16,473
You want to be a cleaner. Here. Take it.

388
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,811
It's a goodbye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

389
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,604
I work alone. Understand? Alone.

390
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,314
Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

391
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,276
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
And they were the best.

392
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
(SIGHS)

393
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,906
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

394
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,826
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

395
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,371
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

396
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,207
Right. So now you're responsible for it.

397
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,169
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

398
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,047
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door,

399
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,217
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

400
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,929
But you did open it. So...

401
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,892
Mathilda...

402
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:04,104
If you don't help me, I'll die tonight.
I can feel it.

403
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,524
Now, I don't want to die tonight.

404
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,528
Mathilda, you're just a little girl.

405
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,282
So don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

406
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm sorry.

407
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,137
How's that?

408
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,628
Mathilda.

409
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,508
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

410
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,093
You got that?

411
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,177
Okay.

412
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,347
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

413
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,307
There is rules.

414
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,725
Okay.

415
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,603
And stop saying "okay"
all the time, okay?

416
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,022
Okay.

417
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,816
Good.

418
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:44,997
Hi.

419
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,625
You expect to use
that in this hotel?

420
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,630
Mister, I have to use it,

421
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,759
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month

422
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,220
and I have to practice.

423
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,849
Okay, okay, okay,
but not after 10:00.

424
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,642
Okay, I promise.

425
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
All right.

426
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,814
I'll put you at
the end of the hall,

427
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,026
so that you don't
disturb anyone.

428
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,362
And would you fill
those out, please?

429
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,241
Oh! Um...

430
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:26,163
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
You know how I like to check in to hotels.

431
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,502
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

432
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,337
Fourth floor!

433
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,422
Thanks, mister!

434
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:40,260
You're lucky to have
a little girl that's interested in things.

435
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,765
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

436
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,274
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

437
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,776
Of course.

438
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,200
Hi.

439
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,966
I'm putting in a name
of a girl in my class who makes me sick.

440
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,305
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

441
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,950
There. Finished.

442
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,993
How old are you?

443
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,829
18.

444
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,039
18?

445
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,333
Want to see my license?

446
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,793
No.

447
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,712
Just look a little younger.

448
00:45:58,965 --> 00:45:59,965
Thanks.

449
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,017
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

450
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,104
I want to be strong like you, smart like you.

451
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,230
Mathilda.

452
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,691
I know I'm not strong enough yet,

453
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,695
but I could learn the basics, the theory.

454
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,490
What do you think?
Just the theory.

455
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,119
I need this, Leon.

456
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,789
I need time to get
my head together.

457
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,499
Yeah, and I need

458
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:43,133
a drink.

459
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,303
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

460
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,641
(DOOR CLOSING)

461
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,352
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

462
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,664
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,

463
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,958
I thought my hearing's going.

464
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:21,546
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

465
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,840
I like to stay in shape.

466
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:27,427
Sure. Always stay on top.

467
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,514
It's like me.
I got to know where everything is all the time.

468
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,852
That's why I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

469
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,024
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

470
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,279
Yeah.

471
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,370
Check it.

472
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,539
Make sure it's the right thing.

473
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,666
I trust you.

474
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,836
One thing's got nothing to do with the other.
Remember that, Leon.

475
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,713
I will.

476
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,357
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,

477
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,902
because it lets you keep your
distance from the client.

478
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,405
The closer you get
to being a pro,

479
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,074
the closer you can
get to the client.

480
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,161
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

481
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,039
Okay?

482
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:39,749
Okay.

483
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,419
Position.

484
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,358
No.

485
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,321
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

486
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:13,575
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

487
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,703
And always dress down.

488
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,749
Never brighter than
the floor, okay?

489
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,042
Okay.

490
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,963
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

491
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,300
Who should I hit?

492
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,885
Whoever.

493
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,268
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes.

494
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,895
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
You guys in the suits get lost.

495
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,730
I don't want to see you, all right?

496
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,231
AGENT ON RADIO:
Is everyone in position?

497
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,108
This has to look natural.

498
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,703
MATHILDA: No women,
no kids, right?

499
00:49:58,788 --> 00:49:59,788
LEON: Right.

500
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,881
Jogger in the yellow
and orange?

501
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,257
Okay.

502
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,929
Keep calm.

503
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,477
Don't take your eyes off him.

504
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,605
Breathe easy.

505
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:29,359
Watch his movement.

506
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,988
Pretend you're running with him.

507
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,120
Try to feel his next movement.

508
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,040
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

509
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,426
Now.

510
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,719
- Ow!
- Oh, my God!

511
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,805
- Get down!
- I'm all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.

512
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,057
AGENT 1: Get down! Get down!
Where'd that come from?

513
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:03,059
One shot. Not bad, huh?

514
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,729
What the hell? I'm fine.
I just can't breathe! Get off of me.

515
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:07,814
AGENT 2: Stay down!

516
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,816
Can we try with
real bullets now?

517
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,986
Not today. Let's pack up.

518
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,163
They go like that.

519
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,499
Here. After...

520
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,797
Suggests

521
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:36,426
Exciting sex

522
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:42,849
His fingers focus on her

523
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,936
Touches

524
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:51,024
He's Venus as a boy

525
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:07,957
No, thanks.

526
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,083
No discussion.

527
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,648
He believes in beauty

528
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,859
He's Venus as a boy

529
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:38,947
He believes in beauty

530
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:46,246
He believes in beauty

531
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,916
He's Venus as a boy

532
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,502
"It seemed

533
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,089
"to Socrates..."

534
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,636
"To Socrates..."

535
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,598
I'll do it.

536
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,115
Leon, all we do is work.

537
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,660
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

538
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,620
What kind of game?

539
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,539
I have this great game.

540
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,918
It makes you think and it helps your memory.
It's exactly what you need.

541
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,505
Okay.

542
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,303
(HUMMING)

543
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,100
Like a virgin

544
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,187
Touched for
the very first time

545
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,983
Like a virgin

546
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,986
Okay, who is it?

547
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,154
I don't know.

548
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,698
Okay.

549
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:15,960
Happy birthday to you

550
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,341
Happy birthday,
Mr. President

551
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,176
I don't know.

552
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,228
Moustache.

553
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,441
No.

554
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,070
I'm singing in the rain

555
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,031
Just singing in the rain

556
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,282
What a...

557
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:47,492
Gene Kelly?

558
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,868
(SIGHING)

559
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,121
Good. Your turn now.

560
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,206
Huh?

561
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,671
Okay, pilgrim.

562
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,256
Uh...

563
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,094
Clint Eastwood?

564
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,227
I don't know.
I give up.

565
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,230
John Wayne.

566
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,692
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

567
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,736
Leon, really brilliant.

568
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,782
Amazing.

569
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,841
You love your plant, don't you?

570
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,676
It's my best friend.

571
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,430
Always happy.
No questions.

572
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,767
It's like me, you see.

573
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,603
No roots.

574
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,898
If you really love it,
you should plant it in the middle of a park,

575
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,067
so that it can have roots.

576
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,154
Yeah.

577
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:09,949
I'm the one you should be watering
if you want me to grow.

578
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,785
You're right.

579
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,162
(SCREAMING)

580
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,251
No! No!

581
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,420
Yes! Yes! Yes!

582
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,089
Wait! Stop!

583
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,101
Stop. Stop!

584
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,228
(BOTH LAUGHING)

585
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:43,941
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

586
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,077
It's been a long time, Leon.

587
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,835
I missed you.

588
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:06,172
And you missed
some nice jobs, too.

589
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,298
Been training.

590
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,719
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

591
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,931
You know, training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

592
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,140
Tony.

593
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,481
All the money I make,
that you keep for me...

594
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,441
You need some money?

595
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:26,859
No. Just curious.

596
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:32,198
Because I've been working a long time
and I haven't done anything with my money.

597
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,206
I thought maybe someday
I could use it.

598
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,834
You met a woman.

599
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,383
Leon.

600
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,638
Leon, you got to be
careful with women.

601
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,057
Remember when you arrived
in this country, Leon?

602
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,186
When I took you in,
you were still wet behind the fucking ears,

603
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,606
and already you
were in deep shit because of a woman.

604
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,316
Don't forget that, Leon.

605
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,026
I wish I could sometimes.

606
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,157
You know, about my money,

607
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,911
maybe I could give

608
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,372
a little

609
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,917
to someone.

610
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,588
You know, to help out.

611
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,425
Hey, it's your money.

612
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,386
I mean, I'm just holding it for you,
you know, like a bank.

613
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,680
Except, you know,
better than a bank,

614
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,974
because, you know,
banks always get knocked off.

615
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,351
You know, no one knocks off old Tony.

616
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,478
And besides, with a bank,

617
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,524
there's always tons of forms
to be filled and all that shit.

618
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:52,111
But old Tony,
nothing to read, nothing to write.

619
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:53,613
It's all in his head.

620
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,616
I know how to read now.

621
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,496
That's good, Leon. Good.

622
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:09,462
Your money's here. Whenever you want it,
you just ask me. Okay?

623
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,755
Here's a grand. No, no. Come on.

624
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:12,006
It's okay. I don't need it.

625
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,883
- Come on. Take it. Have some fun.
- No.

626
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,384
Go ahead. Take it.

627
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,552
Thank you.

628
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:21,140
All right. Now let's talk business.

629
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,643
Don't move. I'll go get the file.

630
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,105
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

631
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,590
Listen, Mathilda,
you better be careful.

632
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:57,760
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

633
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,472
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

634
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,558
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

635
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:08,104
I want you to stop cursing.

636
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,606
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

637
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:13,526
I want you to make
an effort to talk nice.

638
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,529
Okay.

639
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,617
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

640
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,995
Okay.

641
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,168
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

642
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,630
Okay.

643
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,593
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

644
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,304
Okay.

645
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:57,361
Leon, I think I'm kind of
falling in love with you.

646
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,075
It's the first time for me, you know.

647
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,704
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

648
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,248
'Cause I feel it.

649
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,042
Where?

650
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,756
In my stomach.

651
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,968
It's all warm.

652
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:28,350
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

653
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,483
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't
have a stomach ache anymore.

654
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,111
I don't think it means anything.

655
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,782

817
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,136
- The second finishes him off.
- What the fuck...

818
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,262
What are you fucking doing?

819
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,304
Never in the face.

820
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:26,599
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

821
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:30,395
Because you could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

822
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,521
Got it?

823
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,064
Got it. Never in the face.

824
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,774
Okay. Now you can put the tools away.

825
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,276
What are you fucking doing?

826
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,112
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

827
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:42,365
What are you fucking...

828
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:49,581
You see, when you use the silencer a lot,
you have to put a piece of cloth here,

829
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,667
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

830
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:55,086
A damp, black cloth
is the best.

831
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,425
What you doing?

832
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,970
We said no women, no kids.

833
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,849
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

834
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:25,450
Now it's clean.

835
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,662
Let's get out of here.

836
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,221
I thought we don't
have the right to drink.

837
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,974
I know, but we're
making an exception for your first time.

838
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,230
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well done,

839
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,567
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

840
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,987
No.

841
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,448
Yes.

842
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,202
What you doing?

843
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:10,745
I'm going to kiss you.

844
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,247
Mathilda, stop, please.

845
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,165
Come on. Just a kiss.

846
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:16,835
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

847
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,381
Go sit down.

848
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,266
WAITER: Enjoy.

849
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,357
You don't believe me, do you?

850
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,610
- How's that?
- When I say I'm in love with you.

851
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:46,823
Mathilda, please drop it.
Just change the subject, okay?

852
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,700
Okay, okay. Sorry.

853
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:53,162
So how old were you when
you made your first hit?

854
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:55,790
19.

855
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:59,168
Beat you.

856
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,515

01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,817
What you doing?

859
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,527
Can't afford to catch a cold.

860
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:55,493
There's no doorbell.

861
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,286
So knock on the door.

862

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

863

864
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:04,544
Hi.

865
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:07,922
I'm looking for
Mr. Reuben's apartment,

866
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,883
but it's all dark out here in the hall,
and I'm lost.

867
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:15,263
MAN: Just a second.

868
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,693
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

869
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,903
You think you're going
to get me that easily?

870
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,534
Fuck you. Motherfucker.

871
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:39,495
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

872
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:43,666
Better make it quick
or else we'll be all day listening to his crap.

873
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,836
MAN: Asshole! Come on,
show me your fucking face, faggot!

874
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,087
Come on, gum trick.

875
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,213
Hey.

876
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:52,383
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

877
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:56,387
MAN: Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting. Show it to me, motherfucker.

878
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,107
LEON: That's the ring trick.

879
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:26,751
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

880
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:41,891
Hey, Leon, what's up?
All done already?

881
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:43,768
No, no.

882
01:23:45,104 --> 01:23:46,938
Nicer than people, eh?

883
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:49,690
TONY: I told you that.

884
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,112
- You got a problem?
- No.

885
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,617
Get the chair. Sit down. Sit.

886
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,667
I was thinking.

887
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:14,590
If something happens
to me someday...

888
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:18,219
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.

889
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,639
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you.
You play with them.

890
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,309
Tony, I thought about my money.

891
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:34,819
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

892
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:36,988
Yeah.

893
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:42,994
Her name is Mathilda.

894
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,497
If anything happens to me,

895
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:51,127
I'd like you

896
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,463
to give her

897
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:58,426
my money.

898
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,182
You can count on me, Leon.

899
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,767
- Thank you, Tony.
- Yeah.

900
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,190
I won't be long.

901
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,610
Did I do something wrong?

902
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:16,777
No.

903
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:20,281
This one is too big.

904
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:24,869
Yeah, and I only get
the leftovers, is that it?

905
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:30,666
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.

906
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:35,129
So I just need
some time alone.

907
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,302
You need some time
to grow up a little.

908
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,554
I finished growing up, Leon.

909
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,640
I just get older.

910
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,517
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

911
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,647
I need time to grow up.

912
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:07,787
(DOOR CLOSING)

913
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:08,955
Shit.

914
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,408
Come on! Come on! Come on! Hustle!

915
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,493
Good shot.

916
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:30,619
Come on.

917
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:37,209
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

918
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,045
You know, you can't sit here like that.

919
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,254
Really, why not?

920
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:43,049
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

921
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:45,718
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

922
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,220
- Only on TV.
- What'd you say?

923
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,389
Forget it.
How much is your meter?

924
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:51,515
Ten dollars,

925
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,351
a month.

926
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,355
Got change?

927
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,233
Don't worry about it.
We'll do 10 for 12.

928
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:04,236
I'll pay now for the rest
of the year, okay?

929
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,863
Okay, a year.

930
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:09,450
Does paying rent here
mean I have to put up with you guys?

931
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,702
No.

932
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,747
So go play somewhere else.

933
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,169

Good.

And now I want you to tell me
everything you know about Italian food.

And don't forget
the name of the chef who fixed it for me.

Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

961

So this is something

personal, is it?

No.

It's always the same thing.

It's when you start to become
really afraid of death

01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,953
that you learn to appreciate life.

Yes.

That's good.

01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:37,588
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

982
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:43,177
Malky was making a buy
for us from the Chinaman.

983
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,054
Yo, but they got nothing
to do with it, man.

984
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:50,976
They told me this guy came from the outside.
He was a pro.

985
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:54,855
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

986
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,941
Boom, shoots the Chinaman
dead in two seconds.

987
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,528
Easy, man. I'm a cop.

988
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:04,615
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

989
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,617
No women, no kids.

Yeah, man, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

995
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:02,464
Would you take her up to my office?

996
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,676
All right. Yeah.

What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

1013
01:37:23,087 --> 01:37:26,089
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

1014
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,889
Holy shit! What we got here? Lunch.

Careful, Blood,
it might be poisoned.

No, man. There's no anchovies on this.

Yes.

1025
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,437
I like it.

Not thirsty?

1027
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,007
You know,
a girl's first time is very important.

1028
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:35,051
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

1029
01:39:35,261 --> 01:39:38,430
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

1030
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:42,100
My girlfriends told me
that they hated their first experience.

1031
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:46,146
That's because they didn't love the guys.

1032
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,983
They just did it to show off.

1033
01:39:50,067 --> 01:39:53,361
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

Will I like it the first time?

Mathilda, no.

1036
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,128
Why not?

1037
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:12,547
I just can't.

No.

I mean...

1041
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,519
There was someone a long time ago.

1042
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:29,147
Before I came to the States.

1043
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:32,317
Her father didn't want her to see me.

1044
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:36,947
She was from a very respectable family.

1045
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,116
Mine was,

1046
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:42,452
you know,

1047
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:46,456
not so respectable.

1048
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:50,168
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

1049
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:53,547
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

1050
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:55,966
Right.

1051
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:57,926
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

1052
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,472
He killed her.

1053
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,475
One shot through the head.

1054
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:12,941
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

1055
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,320
They said it was an accident.

1056
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:20,740
So

1057
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:26,162
one night I waited for him.

1058
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,959
Five hundred feet with a lens.

1059
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,881
He also had an accident.

1060
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,594
The same night I took
a boat and came here

1061
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,972
to meet up with my father,
who was working for Tony.

1062
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:46,850
I was 19.

1063
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:54,357
Since then I've never left the city,

1064
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,864
and I've never had another girlfriend.

1065
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:05,702
You see, Mathilda,

1066
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:08,997
I wouldn't be a good lover.

1067
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:12,208
Okay.

1068
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:18,006
Would you do me one favor?

1069
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:19,507
What?

1070
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:22,302
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.

1071
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:24,387
We're gonna share the bed.

1072

I don't think it's a good idea.

MATHILDA: It's okay.

1074
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:34,356
Put your legs up on the bed.
Yeah. That's nice.

1075
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:42,614
Put your head down. It's okay. Relax.

I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

1084
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:14,205
When you've killed for us in the past,
we've always been satisfied.

1085
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:19,878
And that's exactly why today
is going to be very, very hard for me.

01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:22,881
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

1087
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:30,180
My man was killed right here on your turf.

1088
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:37,395
And the Chinks tell me that the hit man
was kind of the Italian type.

1089
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:41,775
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

1090

a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office,

armed to the teeth, with the firm intention
of sending me straight to the morgue.

Let the girl go.

1140
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:37,046
Okay, the girl's coming out.

1141
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:38,965
Let the girl go.

1142
01:50:48,225 --> 01:50:51,060
Grab the ax off the wall. Over there. Go!

1143
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:56,774
You're coming with us.

1144
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,372
Christ, he shot him!

1145
01:51:12,624 --> 01:51:13,875
Bastard!

1146
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:26,679
Move, move, move, move!

1147
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,808
Shut the fucking water off!

1148
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:31,934
Got it.

1149
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,686
LEON: Come!

1150
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:38,566
We're in a bad way here.
Send the Cats. I repeat. Send the Cats.

1151
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:52,830
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see them coming, I swear!

1152
01:51:53,499 --> 01:51:57,668
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

1153
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,381
Stay away from the window.

1154
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:15,102
(SCREAMING)

1155
01:52:29,826 --> 01:52:30,826
Leon.

1156
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,120
Leon.

1157
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,512
Come here.

1158
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:53,683
Snipers.

1159
01:52:56,562 --> 01:52:59,522
Okay, now, get this fucking
asshole out of there.

1160
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:19,542
How are we gonna
get out of here now?

1161
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:22,336
Leave it to me.
We're checking out.

1162
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:24,106
But, Leon, it's not big
enough for you.

1163
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:25,566
It's barely big enough for me.

1164
01:54:25,651 --> 01:54:26,901
We said no discussion.

1165
01:54:26,985 --> 01:54:28,152
No, I'm not letting...

1166
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:29,236
Listen...

1167
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:32,281
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen...

1168
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:33,991
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

1169
01:54:34,076 --> 01:54:35,534
I won't go!

1170
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,952
We have no chance together.

1171
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:38,954
But if I'm alone, I can do it. Trust me.

1172
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:42,667
I'm in good shape, Mathilda.
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

1173
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,670
A lot. We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

1174
01:54:45,754 --> 01:54:46,879
Okay? Go.

1175
01:54:46,963 --> 01:54:50,716
No. You're just saying that so I won't worry.

1176
01:54:54,971 --> 01:54:56,722
I don't wanna lose you, Leon.

1177
01:54:56,807 --> 01:54:58,432
You're not gonna lose me, Mathilda.

1178
01:54:58,517 --> 01:55:00,518
You've given me a taste for life.

1179
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:03,521
I wanna be happy, sleep in a bed, have roots.

1180
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:06,565
You'll never be alone again, Mathilda.

1181
01:55:09,403 --> 01:55:12,029
Please, go now, baby. Go.

1182
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:17,076
Calm down. Go now. Go.

1183
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:19,245
Go.

1184
01:55:19,621 --> 01:55:23,499
See you at Tony's.
I'm gonna clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

1185
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,841
I love you, Mathilda.

1186
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:33,175
I love you, too, Leon.

1187
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:50,860
(SCREAMING)

1188
01:56:08,503 --> 01:56:11,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the fuck is going on up there?

1189
01:56:11,465 --> 01:56:14,300
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.

1190
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:37,156
Hey, we've got one breathing here!

1191
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:40,659
Get a medic on the horn!

1192
01:56:44,414 --> 01:56:46,707
Clear the hall! Let him through!

1193
01:56:49,419 --> 01:56:51,712
We've got a wounded man here. Make way!

1194
01:56:51,797 --> 01:56:53,130
Down those stairs.

1195
01:56:55,801 --> 01:56:57,343
Let's go! Move!

1196
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:00,346
Get that guy off the stairs!
Leave him on the landing.

1197
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:02,807
- Get your team back up there!
- I got him!

1198
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:06,936
We've got two men coming down the stairs.
Let's hurry!

1199
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:29,625
You okay?

1200
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:33,963
Hey, I need a medic over here!
Move your fucking asses.

1201
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:36,382
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

1202
01:57:36,466 --> 01:57:39,468
MAN: Can't see shit. Too much smoke in
here. Give us five minutes to clear it out.

1203
01:57:39,553 --> 01:57:40,553
Okay. You got it.

1204
01:57:40,637 --> 01:57:44,390
What, what, what? You're 200 men and you
can't find one man and a girl?

1205
01:57:44,474 --> 01:57:45,808
Did you find the girl?

1206
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:58,737
Hi, how are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

1207
01:58:00,866 --> 01:58:04,618
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...

1208
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:06,412
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

1209
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:07,872
Yeah.

1210
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:13,878
MEDIC: All right,
let's open up his sleeve a little bit.

1211
01:58:16,882 --> 01:58:19,925
All right, fine. Put it down.
Put it down. This one.

1212
01:58:37,027 --> 01:58:39,028
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

1213
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:42,531
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

1214
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:45,659
Okay. You're all right.
Sit tight.

1215
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:54,543
Okay, come on, everybody out!

1216
01:58:54,753 --> 01:58:58,047
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on. Out!

1217
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:24,740
MAN: Clear the way.
Clear the way, men.

1218
01:59:34,334 --> 01:59:36,835
COP: Come on. What are you doing here?
Get out. Get out. Come on.

1219
02:01:28,698 --> 02:01:30,032
Stansfield.

1220
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:32,534
At your service.

1221
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:44,630
This is from

1222
02:01:51,221 --> 02:01:52,554
Mathilda.

1223
02:02:09,572 --> 02:02:10,572
Shit.

1224
02:02:32,262 --> 02:02:33,262
Get out of here!

1225
02:02:37,267 --> 02:02:40,894
Leon asked me to help you out
if something happened,

1226
02:02:42,272 --> 02:02:44,773
and I think something happened, right?

1227
02:02:44,858 --> 02:02:47,359
He put aside a little cash for you.

1228
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:52,406
So what I'm suggesting
is that seeing as how you're still so young,

1229
02:02:53,283 --> 02:02:56,285
I should hold the money
for you until you're older.

1230
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:57,369
Like a bank, you know,

1231
02:02:57,453 --> 02:03:02,291
except it's better than a bank, 'cause,
you know, banks always get knocked off.

1232
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:06,003
No one knocks off old Tony.
But it's your money.

1233
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:11,133
In the meantime,
all you gotta do is come here

1234
02:03:11,217 --> 02:03:15,846
every once in a while and I'll dish it out so
you can have a little fun, okay?

1235
02:03:18,266 --> 02:03:19,349
Here.

1236
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,269
Here's a hundred bucks to start with.

1237
02:03:22,353 --> 02:03:23,979
Can't I get a job instead?

1238
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,647
A job?

1239
02:03:27,984 --> 02:03:29,234
What the hell can you do?

1240
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:30,694
I can clean.

1241
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:37,242
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid,
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1242
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:40,829
It's over! The game's over! Leon's dead!

1243
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:43,665
You hear me?

1244
02:03:53,968 --> 02:03:56,678
Come on. You think I ain't hurting, too?

1245
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:03,560
But he's dead.

1246
02:04:04,646 --> 02:04:08,440
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1247
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:09,816
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

1248
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:12,861
Now take this money
and get the hell out of here.

1249
02:04:12,946 --> 02:04:15,030
And don't let me
see your face till next month,

1250
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:19,201
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1251
02:05:10,878 --> 02:05:12,254
My parents

1252
02:05:14,757 --> 02:05:18,468
died in a car accident four weeks ago.

1253
02:05:21,306 --> 02:05:22,931
It was terrible.

1254
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,478
You know, we didn't have the
time to get to know one another

1255
02:05:28,563 --> 02:05:30,605
when you first came here,

1256
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:34,234
but I want you to know that I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child,

1257
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:37,321
whatever her situation, whatever her mistake.

1258
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:42,159
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1259
02:05:44,537 --> 02:05:46,288
But on one condition.

1260
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:49,583
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1261
02:05:50,626 --> 02:05:54,004
I want you to take a chance and trust me.

1262
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:57,799
Now, tell me what happened to you.

1263
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:00,010
Okay.

1264
02:06:01,846 --> 02:06:06,308
My family got shot down by DEA officers
because of a drug problem.

1265
02:06:08,478 --> 02:06:10,896
I lived with the greatest guy on Earth.

1266
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:15,650
He was a hit man,
the best in town, but he died this morning.

1267
02:06:15,943 --> 02:06:19,154
And if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1268
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:40,801
You know her?

1269
02:06:40,885 --> 02:06:42,677
No. I've never seen her.

1270
02:07:09,455 --> 02:07:11,873
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.

1271
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:17,170
He deals the cards
as a meditation

1272
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:22,426
And those he plays
never suspect

1273
02:07:24,929 --> 02:07:29,724
He doesn't play
for the money he wins

1274
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:34,354
He doesn't play for respect

1275
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:40,068
He deals the cards
to find the answer

1276
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,407
The sacred geometry
of chance

1277
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:52,581
The hidden law
of a probable outcome

1278
02:07:53,499 --> 02:07:56,626
The numbers lead a dance

1279
02:07:58,921 --> 02:08:03,758
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier

1280
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:08,430
I know that the clubs
are weapons of war

1281
02:08:10,266 --> 02:08:15,353
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art

1282
02:08:15,438 --> 02:08:20,275
But that's not the shape
of my heart

1283
02:08:22,153 --> 02:08:25,989
He may play
the jack of diamonds

1284
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:31,453
He may lay
the queen of spades

1285
02:08:33,206 --> 02:08:38,126
He may conceal
a king in his hand

1286
02:08:39,128 --> 02:08:42,339
While the memory of it fades

1287
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:49,513
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier

1288
02:08:50,223 --> 02:08:54,476
I know that the clubs
are weapons of war

1289
02:08:56,103 --> 02:09:01,024
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art

1290
02:09:01,108 --> 02:09:05,820
But that's not the shape
of my heart

1291
02:09:06,989 --> 02:09:12,661
But that's not the shape

1292
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:19,209
The shape of my heart

1293
02:09:43,693 --> 02:09:47,362
And if I told you
that I loved you

1294
02:09:49,365 --> 02:09:52,617
You'd maybe think
there's something wrong

1295
02:09:54,704 --> 02:10:00,333
I'm not a man
of too many faces

1296
02:10:00,876 --> 02:10:03,753
The mask I wear is one

1297
02:10:06,882 --> 02:10:10,552
Those who speak know nothing

1298
02:10:12,638 --> 02:10:16,391
And find out to their cost

1299
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:22,939
Like those who curse
their luck in too many places

1300
02:10:23,733 --> 02:10:27,569
And those who fear are lost

1301
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:33,867
I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier

1302
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:38,580
I know that the clubs
are weapons of war

1303
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:45,587
I know that diamonds
mean money for this art

1304
02:10:45,671 --> 02:10:49,799
But that's not the shape
of my heart

1305
02:10:51,344 --> 02:10:55,138
But that's not the shape
of my heart

1306
02:10:57,099 --> 02:11:02,729
But that's not the shape

1307
02:11:02,813 --> 02:11:06,650
The shape of my heart
