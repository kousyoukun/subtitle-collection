1
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:14,798
Let's talk business.

2
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:19,448
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

3
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,714
You know Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

4
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:26,088
He just wants
a little conversation.

5
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,923
But this guy.
He don't wanna hear about it.

6
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:30,895
Maybe he'll listen to you.

7
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:34,956
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

8
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,994
Yeah. I'm free Tuesday.

9
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,822
Nice to see you again.
Mr. Jones.

10
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,929
Remember. Neatness counts.

11
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,440
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,341
One hour.

13
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,763
What?

14
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,996
It's Tonto. Downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:47,371
What's he look like?

16
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:52,003
Serious.

17
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:55,104
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

18
00:03:57,383 --> 00:04:01,285
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

19
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:09,023
Mickey. Open your eyes.
We got company.

20
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,361
We got company.

21
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,244
Come on.

22
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,421
Stop. Man!

23
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,935
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back. And hurry up.

24
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,144
- Sweetie. What's going on?
- Don't worry. Baby.

25
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,313
It's cool. Take a nap.

26
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,974
Oh. My God.

27
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:06,204
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

28
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,849
Check the terrace!

29
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,087
<i>- 911 emergency.
- I need help.</i>

30
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
<i>- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Just stay on the line.</i>

31
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:33,257
<i>I'll just be off a moment.</i>

32
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:35,766
<i>I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.</i>

33
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,252
<i>DetectiveJefferson.
May I help you?</i>

34
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,291
I'll call you back.

35
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:07,626
Relax. Man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

36
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,466
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead. Take it. It's yours.

37
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,275
Dial this number.

38
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:34,116
I'll talk to you later.
Sweetie. Okay?

39
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,192
Bye.

40
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,002
<i>- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?</i>

41
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:48,665
<i>- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean. No.</i>

42
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:50,675
Just for today.

43
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:53,507
<i>So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...</i>

44
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,343
<i>and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.</i>

45
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:59,009
Yeah. Right.

46
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:01,848
<i>Let me speak
to our mutual friend.</i>

47
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,917
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:15,359
<i>Make sure he understands.
And let him go.</i>

49
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:27,712
Do you understand?

50
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,408
- So say it.
- I understand.

51
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:33,884
Good.

52
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,412
Jesus.

53
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:13,916
Two milk as usual?

54
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,557
Why did you hide the cigarette?

55
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,427
This building's full of rats.

56
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:33,801
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

57
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:44,215
What happened?

58
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:48,844
I fell off my bike.

59
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,334
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette. Okay?

60
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:19,281
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know...

61
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,616
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

62
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:25,054
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

63
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,149
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

64
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:30,059
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

65
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,222
- I don't know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me.

66
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,891
In June. We gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

67
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,562
Now it's July. We pick up the dope.
And it tests 90 percent pure.

68
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:42,164
Somewhere between June and July.
Ten percent turned to cut!

69
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,506
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff. I hold it.

70
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:49,069
- That's all I know.
- I'm trying to help you out here...

71
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,810
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

72
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,250
I gotta disturb him.

73
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:59,586
When he's into his music.
He hates being disturbed.

74
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,922
I'm telling you the truth.

75
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:06,260
I hope so. Because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

76
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:08,162
It's scary.

77
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:11,327
It's almost like a sixth sense.

78
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:15,271
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

79
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:19,942
I'm telling you the truth.

80
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,952
All right.

81
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,284
Stan.

82
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:40,324
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

83
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,700
Of course he didn't.

84
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,848
Just do me a favor.

85
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,616
Find out who did by tomorrow.

86
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,520
Noon.

87
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,697
Malky. Wait.

88
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:56,798
I didn't cut your shit.

89
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,309
Find out yourself!

90
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:05,716
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

91
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:08,446
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

92
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,044
clean up the goddamn house!

93
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,215
And stop smoking cigarettes!

94
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,128
<i>One!</i>

95
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,628
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

96
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,764
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

97
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,936
<i>- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.</i>

98
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,741
Change the channel.
And I'll smash your face.

99
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,214
<i>Ready for the legs.
And down.</i>

100
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,954
Sorry. Sweetheart.

101
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,861
<i>Squeeze. Release.</i>

102
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:36,196
Good morning.

103
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,327
Hi. Honey.

104
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,838
Sweetheart. Turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

105
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:47,140
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

106
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:49,146
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

107
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,205
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

108
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,547
<i>Two and up.</i>

109
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:56,052
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

110
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,715
move a little ass
and go get some food?

111
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:03,284
<i>- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.</i>

112
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:11,730
- Margie. I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

113
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:15,239
You always come up
with somethin'. Right?

114
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,571
I think I went too far this time.

115
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:21,078
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

116
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:23,580
How about workin'
at home today?

117
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:29,410
<i>Really feel it.
That's it. Stomach in.</i>

118
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:33,083
<i>- One...
- Now it's my turn!</i>

119
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,718
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

120
00:18:35,794 --> 00:18:38,228
- Daddy. She's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

121
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,562
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

122
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:45,902
Fuckin' bitch.

123
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:50,772
<i>- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

124
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:54,903
<i>When you use the Quadra-Step.
Your thigh muscles...</i>

125
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,972
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

126
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:06,957
<i>- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...</i>

127
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:11,519
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood. NewJersey.</i>

128
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,292
<i>Is Mr. Or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

129
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:19,261
This is she.

130
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,636
<i>Mrs. Lando. When your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...</i>

131
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,971
<i>he told us she had "Problems."</i>

132
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,637
<i>As you know. We pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...</i>

133
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,805
<i>into healthy.
Productive young women.</i>

134
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,816
<i>But if they are not here.
There is very little we can do.</i>

135
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,149
<i>Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

136
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:39,156
<i>I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...</i>

137
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:43,320
<i>but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...</i>

138
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:47,331
<i>you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...</i>

139
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:50,334
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

140
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,927
She's dead.

141
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:16,860
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

142
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:21,194
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

143
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,699
Hurry up!

144
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,309
<i>Why am I feeling</i>

145
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:40,317
<i>When things could look black</i>

146
00:20:40,385 --> 00:20:44,685
<i>That nothing
could possibly go wrong</i>

147
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:50,717
<i>This has been
a most unusual day</i>

148
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:54,991
<i>Love has made me see things</i>

149
00:20:55,066 --> 00:21:00,902
<i>In a different way</i>

150
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,732
Is life always this hard.
Or is it just when you're a kid?

151
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:38,108
Always like this.

152
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,282
Keep it.

153
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:58,193
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

154
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:01,198
<i>One quart or two?
It's two. Right?</i>

155
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:48,669
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

156
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,272
It reminds me of Beethoven.

157
00:23:57,682 --> 00:24:00,845
Can you hear it?

158
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,787
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

159
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:07,051
you can hear it growin'.

160
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,889
You can hear the insects.

161
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,525
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

162
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:20,571
I'm gonna play you some.

163
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,975
Daddy!

164
00:24:37,455 --> 00:24:39,389
You better stay here.

165
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,100
We said noon.

166
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,572
I've got one minute past.

167
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,637
You don't like Beethoven.

168
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:38,079
You don't know
what you're missing.

169
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:42,643
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

170
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,314
So powerful.

171
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,554
But after his openings.
To be honest...

172
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:53,723
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

173
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,027
That's why I stopped!

174
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,672
Toss the apartment.

175
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:29,129
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

176
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,192
I love Mozart!

177
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:39,776
He was Austrian. You know.

178
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:43,610
But for this kind of work.
He's a little bit light.

179
00:26:43,681 --> 00:26:46,707
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

180
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:50,379
- Cool.
- Dude. What the fuck are you doing?

181
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:53,219
<i>Man.
Keep your bombacut mouth shut.</i>

182
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:57,159
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

183
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:59,788
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man. Knock it off!

184
00:27:14,646 --> 00:27:17,479
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

185
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:00,890
Wow.

186
00:28:20,678 --> 00:28:23,408
Oh! Fuck!

187
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,813
He's dead.

188
00:28:25,883 --> 00:28:30,149
Jesus. Look what you did.

189
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:32,155
Stan. You all right?

190
00:28:52,577 --> 00:28:54,511
What are you doin'?

191
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,675
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

192
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,241
Yeah. I know.
But he's dead.

193
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,686
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

194
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm calm.

195
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:08,587
Stay there. All right?

196
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,397
Benny!

197
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:22,229
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

198
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,902
Take it easy. All right?

199
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:27,774
Come on.

200
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:33,550
Come on.
Let's get a cigarette.

201
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:36,109
Benny. We're comin' out!

202
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:38,985
Benny. Don't fire!

203
00:29:39,056 --> 00:29:41,854
Get in there!

204
00:29:41,926 --> 00:29:44,326
Jesus fuckin' Christ. Benny!

205
00:29:44,395 --> 00:29:48,024
You wear somethin' new and...
Got a light?

206
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,067
Take it easy.

207
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:53,236
What's happening out there?

208
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:55,169
It's all right. Ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

209
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:58,436
Leave that poor family alone.

210
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:02,138
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

211
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:04,443
Why don't you
leave them alone?

212
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,944
He said go back inside.

213
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:16,488
Stan. I think it's better
if we go inside.

214
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:39,481
Benny. Turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

215
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,213
Willy Blood. Iook what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

216
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:45,221
Did you really
have to do that?

217
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:03,734
Please open the door.

218
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,357
Benny.
There are three kids here.

219
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:05,766
I think Stan killed this girl.

220
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,396
Willy. That asshole.
Shot the little boy.

221
00:32:08,472 --> 00:32:10,997
The third one's missing.
Find her.

222
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:22,913
Shit. We missed
the little girl. Man.

223
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:26,582
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

224
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:57,416
<i>- Don't you recognize me?
- Me. Grimlock. Know you!</i>

225
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:08,964
Shit.

226
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:14,294
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

227
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,466
- They found it.
- I know.

228
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,475
There it is.

229
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:22,478
There's cops outside.
We better go.

230
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:25,982
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

231
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:29,519
What do I say?

232
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:43,495
Tell them...

233
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:47,833
we were doing our job.

234
00:33:57,515 --> 00:34:01,474
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

235
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:09,616
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

236
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:12,720
one day or another.
I would have probably done it myself.

237
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:16,198
Your mother. She...

238
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:18,030
She's not my mother.

239
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:23,631
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

240
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,609
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

241
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:29,043
Not a good half at that.

242
00:34:39,423 --> 00:34:41,357
If you couldn't stand them.
Why are you crying?

243
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:44,394
They killed my brother.

244
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:48,694
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

245
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,700
He never used to cry.

246
00:34:50,768 --> 00:34:54,795
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

247
00:34:54,872 --> 00:34:59,775
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

248
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:04,247
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

249
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,545
But they smell like shit.

250
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:09,919
Not true.

251
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:14,583
As a matter of fact.
Right now I have one in my kitchen...

252
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:16,558
that's very clean...

253
00:35:16,627 --> 00:35:20,757
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

254
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,266
Yes. I do.

255
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:27,498
I was just in there.
And I didn't see any goddamned pig.

256
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:31,007
Don't move.
I'll get him.

257
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:34,911
Piggy. Where are you?

258
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,448
There you are.

259
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,458
Hi. Mathilda.

260
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:51,188
Hi. Piggy.

261
00:35:58,669 --> 00:36:01,900
How are you today?

262
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:04,532
I've seen better days.

263
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:16,484
- What's your name?
- Leon.

264
00:36:18,856 --> 00:36:20,949
Cute name.

265
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:32,028
You have anyone to go to.
Any family anyplace else?

266
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,614
I'm gonna get some more milk.

267
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:05,735
Holy shit.

268
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:15,711
Don't touch that. Please.

269
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,179
What do you do for a living?

270
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,717
Cleaner.

271
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,053
You're a hit man?

272
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,192
Cool.

273
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:46,232
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women. No kids. That's the rules.

274
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:49,370
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

275
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:52,244
who killed my brother?

276
00:37:52,316 --> 00:37:56,082
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

277
00:37:56,153 --> 00:38:00,249
How about I work for you...

278
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:03,816
and in exchange.
You teach me how to clean?

279
00:38:03,894 --> 00:38:06,988
What do you think?

280
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:09,089
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

281
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,396
I'll even wash your clothes.

282
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,004
- Is it a deal?
- No. It's not a deal.

283
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:29,350
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

284
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,254
You've had a rough day today.

285
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:38,684
Go to sleep.
And we'll see tomorrow.

286
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:56,271
You've been really great
with me. Leon...

287
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:59,373
and it's not always like that.

288
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,315
You know?

289
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:10,459
Good night.

290
00:40:26,837 --> 00:40:29,101
You sleep well?

291
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:31,505
Good.

292
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:34,009
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

293
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:36,740
Not my problem.

294
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,562
Read it.

295
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,461
You don't know how to read.

296
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:04,530
I'm learning. But I've had
a lot of work lately...

297
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:07,668
so I'm a little behind.

298
00:41:07,744 --> 00:41:09,211
What's it say?

299
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:13,340
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

300
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:17,877
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

301
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:22,722
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean. But not with me.

302
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:26,388
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

303
00:41:26,463 --> 00:41:29,455
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

304
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:35,731
Mathilda. Why are you
doing this to me?

305
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,468
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

306
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:41,409
I saved your life yesterday.
Right outside the door.

307
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:44,743
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

308
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,251
If you saved my life.
You must've saved it for a good reason.

309
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,082
If you throw me out now.
It's like you never opened your door...

310
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,988
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

311
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:59,461
But you did open it. So...

312
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:07,102
If you don't help me.
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

313
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:09,435
I don't wanna die tonight.

314
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:14,443
You're just a little girl.

315
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:17,446
Don't take it badly.
But I don't think you could do it.

316
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:18,947
I'm sorry.

317
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:39,635
How's that?

318
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,664
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

319
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,173
You got that?

320
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:22,845
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

321
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:24,847
There is rules.

322
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,680
And stop saying "okay"
all the time!

323
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:33,347
Good.

324
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:51,235
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

325
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:56,269
Mister. I have to use it...

326
00:43:56,346 --> 00:44:00,442
because I have an audition
atJuilliard next month...

327
00:44:00,517 --> 00:44:02,747
and I have to practice.

328
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:06,687
Okay. But not after 10:00.

329
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,815
- I promise.
- All right.

330
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:13,796
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

331
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:17,959
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

332
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,524
Fill those out. Please.

333
00:44:23,707 --> 00:44:28,701
Daddy. Can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

334
00:44:32,248 --> 00:44:34,443
Thanks. Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

335
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:36,781
Fourth floor!

336
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:38,445
Thanks. Mister!

337
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:41,615
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

338
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:47,451
I have a kid. 17.
Does nothing all day long.

339
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:56,129
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

340
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:58,003
Of course.

341
00:45:18,928 --> 00:45:22,193
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

342
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:28,261
If things get hot.
She'll take the heat.

343
00:45:45,255 --> 00:45:47,883
There. Finished.

344
00:45:48,424 --> 00:45:51,416
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

345
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:55,254
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

346
00:45:56,299 --> 00:46:00,565
No. You just look a little young.

347
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:02,998
Thanks.

348
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:13,774
Leon. I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

349
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,114
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

350
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:20,720
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

351
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:24,851
but I could learn the basics.
The theory.

352
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:29,058
What do you think?
Just the theory.

353
00:46:29,132 --> 00:46:31,396
I need this. Leon.

354
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:35,229
I need time to get my head together.

355
00:46:35,305 --> 00:46:38,069
Yeah. And I need...

356
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:45,337
a drink.

357
00:46:45,415 --> 00:46:48,407
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

358
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:16,945
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

359
00:47:17,013 --> 00:47:19,277
I thought my hearing was going.

360
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:24,252
I says to myself. " Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

361
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,083
I like to stay in shape.

362
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:30,615
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

363
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:34,390
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

364
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:37,024
I never leave this place.
Except to go from here to there.

365
00:47:40,436 --> 00:47:43,428
Change ain't good. Leon.
You know?

366
00:47:54,384 --> 00:47:55,817
Check it.

367
00:47:57,387 --> 00:48:00,049
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

368
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:03,149
One thing's got nothing to do
with the other. Remember that.

369
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,494
I will.

370
00:48:21,544 --> 00:48:24,513
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

371
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,414
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

372
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:30,714
The closer you get
to being a pro...

373
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:33,984
the closer you can get
to the client.

374
00:48:34,057 --> 00:48:37,584
The knife. For example.
Is the last thing you learn.

375
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:44,699
Position.

376
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:12,692
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

377
00:49:12,762 --> 00:49:15,560
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

378
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:19,362
And always dress down.

379
00:49:19,435 --> 00:49:22,563
Never brighter
than the floor. Okay?

380
00:49:25,441 --> 00:49:30,071
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

381
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:32,239
Who should I hit?

382
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:33,907
Whoever.

383
00:49:40,823 --> 00:49:43,087
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

384
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:45,923
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

385
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:49,453
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

386
00:49:59,008 --> 00:50:02,444
- No women. No kids. Right?
- Right.

387
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,119
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

388
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:19,092
Keep calm.

389
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:25,926
Don't take your eyes off him.

390
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:27,799
Breathe easy.

391
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,166
Watch his movement.

392
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:36,143
Pretend you're running with him.

393
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:42,310
Try to feel his next movement.

394
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:47,219
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

395
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:57,265
Now.

396
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:59,164
Oh. My God!

397
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:02,932
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

398
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:06,771
One shot. Not bad. Huh?

399
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:09,277
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

400
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:13,008
Can we try
with real bullets now?

401
00:51:13,082 --> 00:51:15,050
Not today.
Let's pack up.

402
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,860
Like that.

403
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:11,570
- No. Thanks.
- No discussion.

404
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:55,284
"It seemed...

405
00:52:56,686 --> 00:52:58,620
to Socrates..."

406
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:08,363
I'll do it.

407
00:53:22,378 --> 00:53:24,869
Leon. All we do is work.

408
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:28,075
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

409
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,813
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

410
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:35,687
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

411
00:53:49,071 --> 00:53:50,663
<i>Like a virgin</i>

412
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:55,840
<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

413
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:03,376
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

414
00:54:13,562 --> 00:54:19,330
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

415
00:54:19,402 --> 00:54:23,702
<i>Happy birthday. Mr. President</i>

416
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:26,207
I don't know.

417
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:36,848
Moustache.

418
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:44,383
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

419
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,054
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

420
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:49,689
<i>- What a beaut...
- Gene Kelly?</i>

421
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,733
Good.

422
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:55,635
Your turn now.

423
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:02,906
Okay. Pilgrim.

424
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:07,782
Clint Eastwood?

425
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:19,754
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

426
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:23,822
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

427
00:55:23,899 --> 00:55:26,265
Leon. Really brilliant.

428
00:55:28,671 --> 00:55:30,605
Amazing.

429
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:49,787
- You love your plant. Don't you?
- It's my best friend.

430
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:53,454
<i>Always happy.
No questions.</i>

431
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,124
It's like me. You see.

432
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,361
No roots.

433
00:56:00,436 --> 00:56:04,202
If you really love it. You should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

434
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,939
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

435
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:14,615
You're right.

436
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:27,494
Wait!

437
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,907
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

438
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:57,356
It's been a long time. Leon.

439
00:57:03,265 --> 00:57:05,233
I missed you.

440
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:10,136
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

441
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:14,199
Training's good.
But don't overdo it.

442
00:57:14,276 --> 00:57:16,676
Training don't pay
as good as working. Leon.

443
00:57:16,745 --> 00:57:18,212
Tony...

444
00:57:21,116 --> 00:57:25,746
all the money I make.
That you keep for me...

445
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:27,812
You need some money?

446
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,448
Just curious.

447
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:31,459
I've been working
a long time...

448
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:35,224
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

449
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:43,135
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

450
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:45,571
You met a woman.

451
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,243
You gotta be careful
with women.

452
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:00,288
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

453
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:04,759
When I took you in. You were still wet
behind the fucking ears...

454
00:58:04,827 --> 00:58:07,762
and. Already. You were in deep shit
because of a woman.

455
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:12,733
- Don't forget that. Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

456
00:58:15,337 --> 00:58:17,635
You know. About my money...

457
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:22,109
Maybe I could give...

458
00:58:22,177 --> 00:58:24,270
a little...

459
00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:28,112
to someone.

460
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:31,277
You know. To help out.

461
00:58:33,822 --> 00:58:37,849
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you. Like a bank.

462
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:42,296
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

463
00:58:42,364 --> 00:58:44,696
No one knocks off old Tony.

464
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:47,292
Besides. With a bank...

465
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:50,634
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

466
00:58:50,706 --> 00:58:55,803
But old Tony. Nothing to read.
Nothing to write. It's all in his head.

467
00:58:57,112 --> 00:59:00,445
I know how to read now.

468
00:59:00,516 --> 00:59:03,644
That's good. Leon.

469
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:08,147
Your money's here.

470
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:10,919
Whenever you want it.
You just ask me.

471
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:15,054
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

472
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,590
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

473
00:59:19,668 --> 00:59:23,570
All right.
Now let's talk business.

474
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:27,166
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

475
00:59:27,242 --> 00:59:31,338
Manolo. A glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

476
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:57,037
Listen. Mathilda.
You better be careful.

477
00:59:57,106 --> 00:59:59,700
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

478
01:00:00,943 --> 01:00:03,707
Leon. Get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

479
01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:06,543
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

480
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:10,547
I want you to stop cursing.

481
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:12,883
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

482
01:00:12,955 --> 01:00:16,049
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

483
01:00:20,796 --> 01:00:24,027
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

484
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,403
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

485
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,246
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

486
01:00:55,664 --> 01:00:59,862
Leon. I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

487
01:01:02,438 --> 01:01:05,737
It's the first time for me.
You know.

488
01:01:05,808 --> 01:01:09,175
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

489
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:12,111
'Cause I feel it.

490
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:13,773
Where?

491
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:19,320
In my stomach.

492
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:25,682
It's all warm.

493
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:30,994
I always had a knot there.
And now it's gone.

494
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:39,169
Mathilda. I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

495
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:41,709
I don't think
it means anything.

496
01:01:41,777 --> 01:01:45,645
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

497
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:32,050
How's the practicing going?

498
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:07,121
- How are we today. Miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

499
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:09,130
I understand.

500
01:03:09,198 --> 01:03:11,132
But you're doing all right.

501
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,191
I haven't received
any complaints.

502
01:03:13,268 --> 01:03:17,534
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

503
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:20,198
That's very smart.

504
01:03:20,275 --> 01:03:24,905
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

505
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,107
What does your father do?

506
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:32,977
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

507
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:35,615
Except he's not really my father.

508
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:42,925
He's my lover.

509
01:03:47,002 --> 01:03:50,335
Think I'll go for a walk.

510
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:08,648
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

511
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:11,818
- Where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

512
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,759
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

513
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:17,788
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

514
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:21,862
You got plans?

515
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:29,141
Meet you here?

516
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:46,712
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

517
01:05:46,788 --> 01:05:50,724
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

518
01:05:51,793 --> 01:05:54,626
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

519
01:05:54,696 --> 01:05:56,891
Bang. We shot him.

520
01:06:00,202 --> 01:06:03,137
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

521
01:06:03,205 --> 01:06:05,696
They should have been at school.
Don't you think?

522
01:06:05,774 --> 01:06:07,708
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

523
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:09,801
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

524
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:11,937
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

525
01:06:14,049 --> 01:06:17,610
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

526
01:06:17,686 --> 01:06:20,120
Cooperation.

527
01:06:23,558 --> 01:06:27,460
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

528
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:32,159
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office. Room 4602.

529
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:45,338
Kids should be at school.

530
01:06:46,581 --> 01:06:49,175
Come on. That's my ball!

531
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:53,745
Give that back.
Where you going?

532
01:06:53,822 --> 01:06:57,258
Damn! Where you going. Man?
That's my ball!

533
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:05,933
Follow the blue car.

534
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:09,164
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

535
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:10,795
No. Drive slowly.

536
01:07:10,872 --> 01:07:13,670
Take the hundred bucks.
And shut the fuck up.

537
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:49,135
<i>I do not want to fight you.
but you leave me no choice.</i>

538
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:56,072
<i>Boy.you just gave me
a great idea!</i>

539
01:08:00,046 --> 01:08:03,174
<i>- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...</i>

540
01:08:03,249 --> 01:08:06,377
<i>our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.</i>

541
01:08:06,452 --> 01:08:08,386
<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

542
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:16,227
It's for you.
A present.

543
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:21,956
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

544
01:08:27,006 --> 01:08:30,669
How do you like it?
Nice. eh?

545
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:33,077
Mr. McGuffin?

546
01:08:35,514 --> 01:08:38,074
Can I have a word with you?

547
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:01,394
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand. right?

548
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:04,459
His name is Norman Stansfield.
and he's in room 4602...

549
01:10:04,537 --> 01:10:07,529
in the D.E.A. building.
26 Federal Plaza.

550
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:10,966
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

551
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:13,869
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

552
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:15,777
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

553
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:18,476
I never lend out my gear.

554
01:10:18,551 --> 01:10:20,416
But...

555
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:22,454
you still have your gun.
Use it.

556
01:10:22,521 --> 01:10:25,957
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

557
01:10:26,025 --> 01:10:28,516
Why are you so mean to me?

558
01:10:30,062 --> 01:10:32,587
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

559
01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:36,362
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

560
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:39,869
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

561
01:10:40,606 --> 01:10:43,200
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

562
01:10:43,275 --> 01:10:46,267
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

563
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,336
you expect me to forget?

564
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:50,541
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

565
01:10:50,616 --> 01:10:52,447
Blow their fucking heads off.

566
01:10:52,518 --> 01:10:55,487
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

567
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:00,582
Your life is changed forever.

568
01:11:02,161 --> 01:11:06,063
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

569
01:11:06,132 --> 01:11:08,828
I don't give a shit
about sleeping. Leon.

570
01:11:09,768 --> 01:11:11,827
I want love...

571
01:11:12,171 --> 01:11:14,071
or death.

572
01:11:15,007 --> 01:11:16,668
That's it.

573
01:11:18,377 --> 01:11:20,572
I want death.

574
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:24,446
Get off my case. Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

575
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:30,415
There's this really great game. Leon.

576
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:33,981
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

577
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:40,698
The kind of game you love.

578
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:54,876
If I win...

579
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:58,816
you keep me with you...
for life.

580
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:02,614
And if you lose?

581
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:06,124
Go shopping alone. like before.

582
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:10,685
You're gonna lose. Mathilda.

583
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:15,131
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

584
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:16,566
So what?

585
01:12:16,635 --> 01:12:19,695
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

586
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,999
Nothing.

587
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:30,076
I hope you're not lying. Leon.

588
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:34,716
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

589
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,781
Because if there is...

590
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:43,123
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

591
01:12:45,497 --> 01:12:48,591
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

592
01:12:58,477 --> 01:13:00,468
I love you. Leon.

593
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:18,962
I win.

594
01:13:36,415 --> 01:13:38,849
I took a hit.

595
01:13:39,585 --> 01:13:42,019
I need a hand now.

596
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:46,183
I know she's young.
but she learns fast.

597
01:13:46,258 --> 01:13:48,419
Kids need to be shaped
into something. right?

598
01:13:48,494 --> 01:13:51,759
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

599
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,764
She's 1 8.

600
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:55,766
Really?

601
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:01,336
How about something to drink. Tony?

602
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:04,899
Sure. Manolo. glass of milk
for Leon.

603
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:09,380
Nice tattoo.

604
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:17,455
Manolo. make that two.

605
01:14:36,975 --> 01:14:39,773
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

606
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,804
First you find out
where the chain is.

607
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:46,248
You can't see it.
but you can feel it. Here.

608
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:49,048
- I'll ring. you start talking.
- What do I say?

609
01:14:50,022 --> 01:14:51,853
Whatever you want.

610
01:14:53,892 --> 01:14:55,826
- Yes?
- Hi.

611
01:14:55,894 --> 01:14:57,828
It's Susan.

612
01:14:57,896 --> 01:15:01,127
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door. little girl.

613
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,600
I don't know any Susan.

614
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:07,730
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

615
01:15:07,806 --> 01:15:10,400
The light's out.

616
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:12,410
It's all dark out here.

617
01:15:15,681 --> 01:15:20,175
- Mister. I'm scared.
- Okay.

618
01:15:24,857 --> 01:15:27,587
What the fuck are you doing?

619
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:34,162
Open up.

620
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:38,994
<i>If it leaves your mouth.
I'll pull the trigger. capisce?</i>

621
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:18,806
Here's okay.
Let it go.

622
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:21,243
I said. '' Let it go.''

623
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:23,713
Move. Move over.

624
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,740
Easy. Easy.

625
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:29,754
Easy. Careful.
You want me--

626
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:34,053
Go ahead. Your turn.

627
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:43,434
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

628
01:16:43,502 --> 01:16:46,062
Sir?

629
01:16:49,141 --> 01:16:51,200
Sir. it's not my dope.

630
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:53,244
Sir. look I--

631
01:16:53,312 --> 01:16:55,246
A little left. please.

632
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,274
Before-- Ple--

633
01:17:02,955 --> 01:17:05,856
Now. the security shot.

634
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:13,859
No. the second goes
higher on the chest.

635
01:17:13,932 --> 01:17:16,298
Aim for the heart and lungs.

636
01:17:16,368 --> 01:17:18,393
There. Right there.
You see?

637
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,404
The first shot takes him
out of order.

638
01:17:20,472 --> 01:17:23,373
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

639
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:24,932
Never in the face.

640
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,241
If they can't recognize the client.
you don't get paid.

641
01:17:28,313 --> 01:17:31,976
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

642
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:34,746
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

643
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:38,278
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

644
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:40,655
What the fuck is going on?
Hey. mister!

645
01:17:40,726 --> 01:17:43,251
What are you fuckin--

646
01:17:46,298 --> 01:17:48,960
You see. when you use
the silencer a lot...

647
01:17:49,034 --> 01:17:51,298
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

648
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:54,271
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

649
01:17:54,339 --> 01:17:57,069
A damp. black cloth is the best.

650
01:18:00,412 --> 01:18:02,346
What you doing?

651
01:18:02,414 --> 01:18:05,645
We said no women. no kids.

652
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:09,414
Who do you think this is gonna kill.
junkies and monkeys?

653
01:18:25,003 --> 01:18:27,301
Now it's clean.

654
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:31,171
Let's get out of here.

655
01:18:44,623 --> 01:18:46,557
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

656
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:50,789
I know. but we're making
an exception for your first time.

657
01:18:52,898 --> 01:18:58,234
Well. if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

658
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:02,137
how about a kiss.
like in the movies?

659
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:07,745
Yes.

660
01:19:08,814 --> 01:19:10,543
What you doing?

661
01:19:10,616 --> 01:19:13,084
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop. please.

662
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,984
Come on.Just a kiss.

663
01:19:16,054 --> 01:19:19,387
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

664
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:24,261
Go sit down.

665
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:33,370
Enjoy.

666
01:19:38,944 --> 01:19:41,845
- You don't believe me. do you?
- How's that?

667
01:19:41,913 --> 01:19:46,941
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda. please drop it.

668
01:19:47,019 --> 01:19:50,819
-Just change the subject. okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

669
01:19:52,124 --> 01:19:56,151
So. how old were you
when you made your first hit?

670
01:19:56,228 --> 01:19:58,788
Nineteen.

671
01:19:58,864 --> 01:20:00,798
Beat you.

672
01:21:05,263 --> 01:21:09,700
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

673
01:21:56,414 --> 01:22:00,248
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

674
01:22:03,922 --> 01:22:06,914
- Yes?
- Hi.

675
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:09,326
I'm looking
for Mr. Reubengs apartment...

676
01:22:09,394 --> 01:22:13,160
but it's all dark out here
in the hall. and I'm lost.

677
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:15,165
Just a second.

678
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:30,612
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

679
01:22:30,682 --> 01:22:33,446
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

680
01:22:37,956 --> 01:22:41,357
When it's tough like this.
you know it's gonna be ugly.

681
01:22:41,426 --> 01:22:45,556
<i>Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.</i>

682
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:48,394
Asshole! Come on. show me
your fucking face. faggot!

683
01:22:48,466 --> 01:22:50,798
- Come on. gum trick.
- Hey.

684
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:54,403
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

685
01:22:54,472 --> 01:22:56,940
Ring trick? Come on. asshole.
I'm waiting.

686
01:22:57,008 --> 01:22:58,942
Show it to me. motherfucker.

687
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:10,888
That's the ring trick.

688
01:23:24,736 --> 01:23:28,832
Mario. go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

689
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:43,250
Leon. what's up?
All done already?

690
01:23:46,124 --> 01:23:49,116
Nicer than people. eh?

691
01:23:49,194 --> 01:23:51,128
I told you that.

692
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:55,299
You got a problem?

693
01:23:58,169 --> 01:24:00,137
Get the chair. Sit down.

694
01:24:05,343 --> 01:24:09,302
I was thinking.

695
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:15,646
If something happens
to me someday--

696
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:19,554
Hey. Leon.
nothing's gonna happen to you.

697
01:24:19,624 --> 01:24:22,593
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

698
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:26,791
Tony. I thought about my money.

699
01:24:30,001 --> 01:24:35,564
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

700
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:44,914
Her name is Mathilda.

701
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:48,282
If anything happens to me...

702
01:24:48,353 --> 01:24:52,551
I'd like you...

703
01:24:54,059 --> 01:24:56,493
to give her...

704
01:24:58,196 --> 01:25:00,824
my money.

705
01:25:03,134 --> 01:25:05,762
You can count on me. Leon.

706
01:25:05,837 --> 01:25:08,271
Thank you. Tony.

707
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:13,507
I won't be long.

708
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:17,949
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

709
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:22,053
This one is too big.

710
01:25:22,787 --> 01:25:26,154
Yeah. and I only get the leftovers.
is that it?

711
01:25:28,059 --> 01:25:30,391
Mathilda. since I met you...

712
01:25:30,462 --> 01:25:32,589
everything's been different.

713
01:25:32,764 --> 01:25:37,201
So I just need some time alone.

714
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:41,962
You need some time
to grow up a little.

715
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,736
I finished growing up. Leon.

716
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:46,640
I just get older.

717
01:25:46,711 --> 01:25:50,169
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

718
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,941
I need time to grow up.

719
01:26:09,034 --> 01:26:11,025
Shit.

720
01:27:26,111 --> 01:27:28,511
Come on! Hustle!

721
01:27:30,582 --> 01:27:32,413
- Good shot.
- Come on.

722
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:38,315
You're new. aren't you?
Fifth floor. right?

723
01:27:38,756 --> 01:27:41,316
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really. why not?

724
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:43,860
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

725
01:27:43,928 --> 01:27:46,897
When you stop. you pay.
It's the law.

726
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:49,090
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

727
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,727
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

728
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:54,465
a month.

729
01:27:56,774 --> 01:27:58,605
Got change?

730
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:02,409
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

731
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,710
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

732
01:28:04,782 --> 01:28:06,272
Okay. a year.

733
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:10,212
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

734
01:28:13,391 --> 01:28:15,882
So go play somewhere else.

735
01:28:19,297 --> 01:28:21,629
I need to think.

736
01:29:19,256 --> 01:29:22,453
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

737
01:29:31,869 --> 01:29:33,302
Food.

738
01:29:36,808 --> 01:29:41,541
- Where you going?
- Special delivery. room 4602.

739
01:29:41,612 --> 01:29:43,273
Sign here.

740
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:44,872
Come here.

741
01:29:47,552 --> 01:29:51,613
- Have a nice weekend. girls.
- Thanks.

742
01:29:51,689 --> 01:29:53,623
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

743
01:31:13,237 --> 01:31:15,671
Special delivery?

744
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:17,674
Let me guess.

745
01:31:19,844 --> 01:31:21,311
Chinese?

746
01:31:24,215 --> 01:31:26,479
Thai. maybe?

747
01:31:29,153 --> 01:31:31,986
I've got it.

748
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:34,286
Italian food.

749
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:52,842
What's your name. angel?

750
01:32:22,874 --> 01:32:26,037
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

751
01:32:31,482 --> 01:32:32,915
Good.

752
01:32:35,553 --> 01:32:40,616
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

753
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:43,592
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

754
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:48,291
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

755
01:32:50,735 --> 01:32:52,669
So this is something...

756
01:32:54,572 --> 01:32:57,006
personal. is it?

757
01:33:01,012 --> 01:33:05,108
What filthy piece of shit...

758
01:33:05,182 --> 01:33:07,116
did I do now?

759
01:33:07,184 --> 01:33:10,449
You killed my brother.

760
01:33:14,392 --> 01:33:16,326
I'm sorry.

761
01:33:24,702 --> 01:33:27,330
And you wanna join him?

762
01:33:31,309 --> 01:33:34,972
It's always the same thing.

763
01:33:39,383 --> 01:33:44,286
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

764
01:33:44,355 --> 01:33:47,916
that you learn
to appreciate life.

765
01:33:47,992 --> 01:33:52,361
Do you like life.
sweetheart?

766
01:33:59,236 --> 01:34:00,669
That's good.

767
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,546
Because I take no pleasure...

768
01:34:10,915 --> 01:34:14,282
in taking a life...

769
01:34:14,352 --> 01:34:19,312
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

770
01:34:29,734 --> 01:34:32,294
Stan. I've been looking
all over for you.

771
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:35,669
- I checked upstairs--
- What? I'm busy.

772
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:38,573
It's Malky. man.
He's dead.

773
01:34:40,778 --> 01:34:44,043
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

774
01:34:44,115 --> 01:34:46,948
<i>But they got nothing
to do with it.</i>

775
01:34:47,018 --> 01:34:52,888
<i>They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

776
01:34:52,957 --> 01:34:56,051
<i>He was fast.
He fuckingcame out of nowhere.</i>

777
01:34:56,127 --> 01:34:59,062
<i>Boom. shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.</i>

778
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:02,725
Easy. man.
I'm a cop.

779
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,701
Then turns around.
says something to Malky like--

780
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,931
No women. no kids.

781
01:35:15,946 --> 01:35:18,779
I think
it was something personal.

782
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:25,453
Death is whimsical today.

783
01:35:52,516 --> 01:35:56,213
Blood. do you hear me?

784
01:35:56,287 --> 01:36:00,724
Yeah. I hear you. Stan.
Just chill out. man.

785
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:03,225
Would you take her
up to my office?

786
01:36:04,895 --> 01:36:06,487
All right.

787
01:36:14,839 --> 01:36:16,966
Jesus fucking Christ.

788
01:36:29,286 --> 01:36:30,719
<i>''Leon. my love.</i>

789
01:36:30,788 --> 01:36:33,256
<i>I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.</i>

790
01:36:33,324 --> 01:36:38,023
<i>Their boss is Norman Stansfiield.
He's in the D.E.A. building. room 4602.</i>

791
01:36:38,095 --> 01:36:40,063
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

792
01:36:40,131 --> 01:36:43,931
<i>If something goes wrong.
I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

793
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:47,960
<i>It's for a contract.
Five grand a head. right?</i>

794
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:51,940
<i>I know I'll feel better
after I do this.</i>

795
01:36:52,009 --> 01:36:53,943
<i>I love you. ''</i>

796
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:00,847
Wait. I won't be long.

797
01:37:00,918 --> 01:37:04,183
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

798
01:37:08,759 --> 01:37:12,126
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

799
01:37:12,196 --> 01:37:14,790
A nine ''millie.''

800
01:37:14,865 --> 01:37:16,992
Bullets.

801
01:37:17,067 --> 01:37:18,500
Another nine ''millie.''

802
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:23,964
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

803
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:27,010
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

804
01:37:31,182 --> 01:37:33,013
Holy shit!

805
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,744
What's this? Lunch.

806
01:37:37,354 --> 01:37:39,447
Careful. Blood.
might be poisoned.

807
01:37:39,523 --> 01:37:41,514
There's no anchovies on this.

808
01:37:58,943 --> 01:38:02,709
Is that what you call ''I won't be long''?
I been here for ten minutes.

809
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:05,476
I did my best.

810
01:38:53,163 --> 01:38:54,653
Do you like it?

811
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:57,694
Yes.

812
01:38:58,335 --> 01:39:00,326
So say it.

813
01:39:02,806 --> 01:39:04,296
I like it.

814
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:20,520
Not thirsty?

815
01:39:29,934 --> 01:39:32,994
You know. a girl's first time
is very important.

816
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:36,164
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

817
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:39,368
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

818
01:39:39,643 --> 01:39:43,079
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

819
01:39:44,315 --> 01:39:47,512
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

820
01:39:48,886 --> 01:39:50,945
They just did it to show off.

821
01:39:51,021 --> 01:39:54,821
Afterwards. they started liking it.
like cigarettes.

822
01:39:58,929 --> 01:40:01,523
Will I like it the first time?

823
01:40:05,669 --> 01:40:07,660
Mathilda. no.

824
01:40:09,606 --> 01:40:11,597
Why not?

825
01:40:12,009 --> 01:40:14,204
I just can't.

826
01:40:15,245 --> 01:40:17,736
- You love someone else?
- No.

827
01:40:18,682 --> 01:40:20,513
I mean--

828
01:40:24,021 --> 01:40:26,717
There was someone a long time ago.

829
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:30,290
Before I came to the States.

830
01:40:30,794 --> 01:40:34,059
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

831
01:40:34,865 --> 01:40:38,323
She was from
a very respectable family.

832
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:41,060
Mine was...

833
01:40:41,872 --> 01:40:43,703
you know...

834
01:40:45,442 --> 01:40:47,103
not so respectable.

835
01:40:47,177 --> 01:40:51,045
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

836
01:40:51,115 --> 01:40:53,447
She still snuck off
to see you. right?

837
01:40:55,219 --> 01:40:56,584
Right.

838
01:40:56,653 --> 01:40:59,053
See. nothing can stop love. Leon.

839
01:41:01,525 --> 01:41:03,516
He killed her.

840
01:41:04,194 --> 01:41:06,321
One shot through the head.

841
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:14,065
They kept him in jail for two days.
and they let him go free.

842
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:18,168
They said it was an accident.

843
01:41:20,344 --> 01:41:21,834
So...

844
01:41:23,547 --> 01:41:25,674
one night I...

845
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:28,041
waited for him.

846
01:41:29,386 --> 01:41:31,786
Five hundred feet with a lens.

847
01:41:34,625 --> 01:41:36,456
He also had an accident.

848
01:41:37,728 --> 01:41:41,391
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

849
01:41:41,465 --> 01:41:45,595
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

850
01:41:46,036 --> 01:41:48,368
I was 1 9.

851
01:41:51,809 --> 01:41:55,609
Since then I've never left
the city. and...

852
01:41:59,283 --> 01:42:01,649
I've never had another girlfriend.

853
01:42:04,688 --> 01:42:07,316
You see. Mathilda...

854
01:42:07,391 --> 01:42:09,450
I wouldn't be a good lover.

855
01:42:11,829 --> 01:42:13,490
Okay.

856
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,830
Would you do me one favor?

857
01:42:18,902 --> 01:42:20,392
What?

858
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:22,871
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

859
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,101
We're gonna share the bed.

860
01:42:26,043 --> 01:42:28,375
I don't think it's a good idea.

861
01:42:29,746 --> 01:42:31,646
It's okay.

862
01:42:31,815 --> 01:42:34,113
Put your legs up on the bed.

863
01:42:34,184 --> 01:42:36,243
Yeah. That's nice.

864
01:42:40,657 --> 01:42:43,057
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

865
01:43:04,781 --> 01:43:06,772
Good night. Leon.

866
01:43:09,686 --> 01:43:11,517
Good night.

867
01:43:34,044 --> 01:43:36,239
I want a piece of cake first!

868
01:43:41,251 --> 01:43:45,483
Manolo. take the kids
in the kitchen.

869
01:44:04,675 --> 01:44:07,644
I have a lot of respect
for your business. Tony.

870
01:44:07,711 --> 01:44:10,305
When you've killed for us
in the past...

871
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,872
we've always been satisfied.

872
01:44:13,951 --> 01:44:19,548
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

873
01:44:19,623 --> 01:44:21,557
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

874
01:44:25,762 --> 01:44:29,755
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

875
01:44:29,833 --> 01:44:32,927
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

876
01:44:33,003 --> 01:44:36,837
was kind of the Italian type.

877
01:44:36,907 --> 01:44:40,741
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

878
01:44:40,811 --> 01:44:43,279
Wait. There's more.

879
01:44:43,347 --> 01:44:45,474
You're gonna love this.

880
01:44:47,818 --> 01:44:53,188
A few hours later. a little 1 2-year-old
girl comes into my office...

881
01:44:53,257 --> 01:44:58,024
armed to the teeth. with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

882
01:44:58,095 --> 01:45:01,861
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

883
01:45:03,133 --> 01:45:05,328
The very same...

884
01:45:05,402 --> 01:45:07,495
Italian hit man.

885
01:45:12,142 --> 01:45:14,576
I'm dying to meet him.

886
01:45:19,249 --> 01:45:23,618
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

887
01:45:23,687 --> 01:45:27,851
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

888
01:45:27,924 --> 01:45:29,915
Yeah. I forgot.

889
01:45:29,993 --> 01:45:32,928
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

890
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:37,433
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

891
01:45:39,036 --> 01:45:42,062
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

892
01:45:42,139 --> 01:45:44,004
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

893
01:45:44,074 --> 01:45:46,599
Two knocks. then one.
and two knocks again. Right?

894
01:45:46,677 --> 01:45:48,110
Right.

895
01:46:08,498 --> 01:46:11,433
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

896
01:46:31,755 --> 01:46:33,723
From here on out.
you don't make a sound.

897
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:37,726
<i>You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.</i>

898
01:46:37,794 --> 01:46:40,354
Is he alone?

899
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:42,625
Does he expect you?

900
01:46:42,699 --> 01:46:45,896
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

901
01:46:45,969 --> 01:46:49,234
Is there a code. a way of knocking.
so he knows it's you?

902
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,719
Alpha team.

903
01:47:38,789 --> 01:47:42,384
<i>- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.</i>

904
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:32,602
What up? Move! Fuck.

905
01:48:37,948 --> 01:48:39,779
Shit.

906
01:48:41,218 --> 01:48:43,209
Alpha team. Man down.

907
01:48:44,454 --> 01:48:46,581
I told you.

908
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:53,224
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean. ''everyone''?

909
01:48:53,296 --> 01:48:55,764
Everyone!

910
01:49:49,586 --> 01:49:51,520
Take this.

911
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,454
Go take a look.

912
01:50:14,477 --> 01:50:17,844
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

913
01:50:19,716 --> 01:50:23,652
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

914
01:50:26,756 --> 01:50:28,280
Nobody moves.

915
01:50:28,358 --> 01:50:31,225
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy. man!

916
01:50:33,697 --> 01:50:37,133
Okay. the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.

917
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:50,509
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

918
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:55,909
You're coming with us.

919
01:51:08,164 --> 01:51:09,927
Christ. he shot him!

920
01:51:11,368 --> 01:51:13,836
Bastard!

921
01:51:22,912 --> 01:51:24,345
Move!

922
01:51:28,385 --> 01:51:30,512
- Shut the fucking water off!.
- Got it.

923
01:51:30,587 --> 01:51:32,714
Come!

924
01:51:33,857 --> 01:51:37,554
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

925
01:51:47,671 --> 01:51:51,368
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming. I swear!

926
01:51:51,441 --> 01:51:57,004
I just went shopping and I came back.
and they were everywhere.

927
01:51:58,782 --> 01:52:00,909
Stay away from the window.

928
01:52:47,297 --> 01:52:48,730
Come here.

929
01:52:51,201 --> 01:52:52,634
Snipers.

930
01:52:54,704 --> 01:52:58,606
Okay. now. get this fucking asshole
out of there.

931
01:53:16,326 --> 01:53:20,160
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

932
01:54:20,690 --> 01:54:24,319
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

933
01:54:24,394 --> 01:54:28,194
- We said no discussion.
- No. I'm not letting--

934
01:54:28,264 --> 01:54:33,258
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

935
01:54:34,771 --> 01:54:37,069
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone. I can do it.

936
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:39,370
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

937
01:54:39,442 --> 01:54:42,240
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

938
01:54:42,312 --> 01:54:44,974
We'll take it and leave together.
just the two of us.

939
01:54:45,048 --> 01:54:46,538
Go.

940
01:54:46,616 --> 01:54:49,915
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

941
01:54:53,823 --> 01:54:57,281
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

942
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,294
You've given me
a taste for life.

943
01:54:59,362 --> 01:55:02,695
I wanna be happy.
sleep in a bed. have roots.

944
01:55:02,765 --> 01:55:04,892
You'll never be alone again.

945
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:11,435
Please. go now. baby. Go.

946
01:55:13,509 --> 01:55:15,977
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

947
01:55:18,681 --> 01:55:22,674
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

948
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:30,588
I love you. Mathilda.

949
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,719
I love you. too. Leon.

950
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:13,225
Hey. what is going on up there?
Take the guy out. not the building.

951
01:56:33,456 --> 01:56:35,583
We've got one breathing here!

952
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,724
Get a medic on the horn!

953
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:45,566
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

954
01:56:48,204 --> 01:56:52,004
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

955
01:56:55,144 --> 01:56:56,839
Let's go! Move!

956
01:56:56,913 --> 01:56:58,710
Get that guy off the stairs!

957
01:56:58,781 --> 01:57:02,273
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

958
01:57:02,352 --> 01:57:05,412
We've got two men coming
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

959
01:57:27,176 --> 01:57:31,010
You okay?
Hey. I need a medic over here!

960
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,105
Move your fucking asses.

961
01:57:33,182 --> 01:57:35,673
<i>Squad Number One.
what's the status on the apartment?</i>

962
01:57:35,752 --> 01:57:38,084
<i>Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.</i>

963
01:57:38,154 --> 01:57:39,587
You got it.

964
01:57:39,655 --> 01:57:43,284
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

965
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:44,917
Did you find the girl?

966
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:56,764
<i>How are you doing?
Take your mask off. quick.</i>

967
01:57:59,675 --> 01:58:03,771
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here--

968
01:58:03,846 --> 01:58:07,077
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

969
01:58:09,552 --> 01:58:12,783
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

970
01:58:16,025 --> 01:58:19,119
All right. fine. Put it down.
This one.

971
01:58:35,945 --> 01:58:38,004
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

972
01:58:38,081 --> 01:58:41,573
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

973
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:45,644
You're all right.
Sit tight.

974
01:58:51,394 --> 01:58:56,855
Come on. everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

975
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:24,418
Clear the way. men.

976
01:59:33,469 --> 01:59:35,835
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

977
02:01:29,352 --> 02:01:31,479
At your service.

978
02:01:40,062 --> 02:01:44,021
This is from...

979
02:01:50,106 --> 02:01:52,370
Mathilda.

980
02:02:07,456 --> 02:02:09,321
Shit.

981
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:32,213
Get out of here!

982
02:02:35,584 --> 02:02:38,451
Leon asked me
to help you out...

983
02:02:38,521 --> 02:02:42,457
if something happened.
and I think something happened.

984
02:02:42,525 --> 02:02:46,291
He put aside
a little cash for you.

985
02:02:46,362 --> 02:02:49,525
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

986
02:02:49,598 --> 02:02:52,066
seeing as how
you're still so young...

987
02:02:52,134 --> 02:02:55,069
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

988
02:02:55,137 --> 02:02:57,264
Like a bank. you know. except...

989
02:02:57,340 --> 02:03:01,401
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

990
02:03:01,477 --> 02:03:04,173
No one knocks off old Tony.

991
02:03:04,246 --> 02:03:06,908
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

992
02:03:06,982 --> 02:03:10,918
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

993
02:03:10,986 --> 02:03:14,752
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

994
02:03:15,891 --> 02:03:17,324
Here.

995
02:03:17,393 --> 02:03:22,888
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

996
02:03:22,965 --> 02:03:27,902
A job?
What the hell can you do?

997
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:29,801
I can clean.

998
02:03:31,173 --> 02:03:33,641
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

999
02:03:33,709 --> 02:03:35,802
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1000
02:03:35,878 --> 02:03:38,608
It's over!
The game's over!

1001
02:03:38,681 --> 02:03:41,411
Leongs dead!

1002
02:03:41,484 --> 02:03:43,452
You hear me?

1003
02:03:50,659 --> 02:03:55,392
Come on. You think
I ain't hurting too?

1004
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:03,270
But he's dead.

1005
02:04:03,339 --> 02:04:07,298
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1006
02:04:08,544 --> 02:04:11,638
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1007
02:04:11,714 --> 02:04:13,807
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

1008
02:04:13,883 --> 02:04:18,149
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1009
02:05:09,405 --> 02:05:12,863
My parents...

1010
02:05:12,942 --> 02:05:15,035
died...

1011
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:19,706
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1012
02:05:19,782 --> 02:05:21,716
It was terrible.

1013
02:05:24,286 --> 02:05:28,052
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1014
02:05:28,123 --> 02:05:32,856
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1015
02:05:32,928 --> 02:05:36,261
whatever her situation.
whatever her mistake.

1016
02:05:36,332 --> 02:05:41,395
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1017
02:05:43,305 --> 02:05:45,967
But on one condition:

1018
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:49,238
You have to stop lying to me.
Mathilda.

1019
02:05:49,311 --> 02:05:51,472
I want you to take a chance...

1020
02:05:51,547 --> 02:05:54,482
and trust me.

1021
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:57,075
Tell me what happened to you.

1022
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:03,583
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. officers...

1023
02:06:03,659 --> 02:06:07,095
because of a drug problem.

1024
02:06:07,162 --> 02:06:09,756
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1025
02:06:09,832 --> 02:06:14,599
He was a hit man. the best in town.
but he died this morning.

1026
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:18,538
If you don't help me.
I'll be dead by tonight.

1027
02:06:37,927 --> 02:06:41,590
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1028
02:07:08,157 --> 02:07:10,819
I think we'll be okay here.
