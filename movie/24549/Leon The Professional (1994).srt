00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:05,144
- Allora, come stai, Leone?
- Bene

3
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:12,567
Okay, okay. Let's talk business.

4
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:17,222
This fat bastard is trying to move
in on Morizio's business.

5
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,474
And you know, Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

6
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:23,853
He just wants
a little conversation.

7
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:26,731
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

8
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:28,649
Maybe he'll listen to you.

9
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,795
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

10
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,841
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

11
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,650
Nice to see you again,
Mr Jones.

12
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,732
Remember, neatness counts.

13
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,251
You got one half hour.

14
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,178
One hour.

15
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,548
Yeah, what?

16
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:41,778
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

17
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,156
What's he look like?

18
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:49,769
Serious.

19
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,913
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

20
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:59,086
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

21
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:06,843
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

22
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,181
We got company.

23
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,069
Come on.

24
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,246
Stop, stop, man!

25
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,759
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

26
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:38,957
- Hey sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

27
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:41,142
It's cool. Take a nap.

28
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,770
Oh, my God.

29
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,039
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

30
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,669
Check the terrace!

31
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:25,851
- 911 emergency.
- I need help.

32
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,312
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Alright, just stay on the line.

33
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:31,064
I'll just be off a moment.

34
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,583
Sir, I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

35
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:55,045
Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?

36
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:57,064
I'll call you back.

37
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:05,430
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.

38
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,284
Ain't been cut yet. Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.

39
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,082
Dial this number.

40
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:31,931
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

41
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,017
Bye.

42
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,799
- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?

43
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,470
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. No, I mean, no.

44
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,430
Just for today.

45
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,308
Aha, so it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...

46
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:54,102
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.

47
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,813
Yeah. Right.

48
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,666
Let me speak
to our mutual friend.

49
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,753
He wants to talk to you.

50
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,179
Make sure he understands,
and let him go.

51
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:25,507
Do you understand?

52
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,235
- So say it.
- I understand.

53
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,696
Good.

54
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,223
Jesus.

55
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:11,735
Hola! Qué tal amigo? Two milk as usual, eh?

56
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:23,387
Why did you hide the cigarette?

57
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,207
This building's full of rats.

58
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:31,644
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

59
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,029
What happened?

60
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,659
I fell off my bike.

61
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:02,174
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

62
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:17,088
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know--

63
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:20,425
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

64
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,844
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

65
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,971
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

66
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:27,848
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.

67
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,017
- I don't even know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me, alright?

68
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,645
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

69
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:36,357
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

70
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:39,985
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

71
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,280
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

72
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,867
- That's all I know.
- You know I'm trying to help you out here...

73
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,619
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

74
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,997
I gotta disturb him.

75
00:12:52,097 --> 00:12:57,377
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

76
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,712
I'm telling you the truth.

77
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:04,050
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

78
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,927
It's scary.

79
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:09,096
It's almost like a sixth sense.

80
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:13,075
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

81
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,746
I'm telling you the truth.

82
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:26,755
All right.

83
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:31,051
Stan.

84
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,141
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

85
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,474
Of course he didn't.

86
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,635
Just do me a favor.

87
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:35,429
Find out who did by tomorrow.

88
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,322
Noon.

89
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,486
Malky, wait.

90
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,572
I didn't cut your shit.

91
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:57,133
Find out yourself!

92
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,498
What are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

93
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,250
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

94
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,835
clean up the goddamn house!

95
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:10,020
And stop smoking cigarettes!

96
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:00,960
One!

97
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:04,447
Two. Take a deep breath in.

98
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,574
Take a deep breath out.

99
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:10,703
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.

100
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,539
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

101
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:16,016
Ready for the legs.
And down.

102
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:29,763
Sorry, sweetheart.

103
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,639
Squeeze. Release.

104
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,975
Good morning.

105
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,160
Hi, honey.

106
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:41,607
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

107
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,902
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

108
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,946
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

109
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,989
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

110
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,325
Two and up.

111
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:53,827
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

112
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:56,455
move a little ass
and go get some food?

113
00:17:56,555 --> 00:18:01,059
- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.

114
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:09,509
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

115
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:13,012
You always come up
with something, right?

116
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:15,348
I think I went too far this time.

117
00:18:15,448 --> 00:18:18,851
You're going too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

118
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,412
How about working
at home today?

119
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:27,151
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.

120
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:30,821
- One--
- Now it's my turn!

121
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:33,532
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

122
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:36,051
- Daddy, she's--
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

123
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:39,388
Please don't shoot!

124
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:43,708
Fucking bitch.

125
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:48,546
- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.

126
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:52,692
When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles--

127
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:55,778
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

128
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,729
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...

129
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:09,316
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

130
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,086
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

131
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,074
This is she.

132
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:20,410
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...

133
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,746
he told us she had “problems”

134
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:25,415
As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...

135
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,584
into healthy,
productive young women.

136
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,587
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

137
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,923
Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

138
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,926
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...

139
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:41,097
but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...

140
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:45,059
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...

141
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,103
your tuition will be forfeit.

142
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,748
She's dead.

143
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:14,671
Tell that fucking kid to do
a little work around here!

144
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:18,966
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fucking mess.

145
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,526
Hurry up!

146
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:36,108
Why am I feeling

147
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,110
When things could look black

148
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,464
That nothing
could possibly go wrong

149
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:48,553
This has been
A most unusual day

150
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:52,749
Love has made me see things

151
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:58,729
In a different way

152
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:30,510
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

153
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:35,932
Always like this.

154
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,064
Keep it.

155
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:55,976
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

156
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:58,995
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

157
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:46,432
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

158
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:50,060
It reminds me of Beethoven.

159
00:23:55,482 --> 00:23:58,635
Can you hear it?

160
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:02,556
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

161
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:04,808
you can hear it growing.

162
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:07,702
You can hear the insects.

163
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:16,277
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

164
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,379
I'm gonna play you some.

165
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:23,801
Daddy!

166
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,189
You better stay here.

167
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:20,897
We said noon.

168
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:26,402
I've got one minute past.

169
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:32,450
You don't like Beethoven.

170
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:35,853
You don't know
what you're missing.

171
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:40,441
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

172
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,069
So powerful.

173
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:47,364
But after his openings,
to be honest...

174
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,552
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

175
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,806
That's why I stopped!

176
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,479
Toss the apartment.

177
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,902
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

178
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,005
I love Mozart!

179
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,579
He was Austrian, you know.

180
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,416
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

181
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,502
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

182
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:48,173
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

183
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,009
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

184
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,929
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

185
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:57,573
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

186
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,298
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

187
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:58,715
Wow.

188
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:21,178
Oh! Fuck!

189
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,572
He's dead.

190
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:27,893
Jesus. Look what you did.

191
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:29,953
Stan, you all right?

192
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,291
What are you doing?

193
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:56,420
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

194
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,023
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

195
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:02,426
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

196
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,094
I'm calm.

197
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:06,405
Stay there, all right?

198
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:12,202
Benny!

199
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:20,043
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

200
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,697
Take it easy, all right?

201
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,590
Come on.

202
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:31,329
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

203
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:33,915
Benny, we're coming out!

204
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,751
Benny, don't fire!

205
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:39,628
Get in there!

206
00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:42,131
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

207
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:45,759
You wear something new and--
Got a light?

208
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,903
Take it easy.

209
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:51,014
What's happening out there?

210
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:52,975
It's all right, ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

211
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:56,186
Leave that poor family alone.

212
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:59,940
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

213
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,250
Why don't you
leave them alone?

214
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:06,754
He said go back inside.

215
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:14,303
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

216
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:37,225
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

217
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:41,021
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

218
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:42,997
Did you really
have to do that?

219
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:01,515
Please open the door.

220
00:31:57,652 --> 00:32:01,139
Benny,
there are three kids here.

221
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,558
I think Stan killed this girl.

222
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:06,186
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

223
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:08,788
The third one's missing.
Find her.

224
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:20,699
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

225
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,386
I'm gonna find the fucking super
in this goddamn building.

226
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:55,249
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!

227
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:06,802
Shit.

228
00:33:08,136 --> 00:33:12,082
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

229
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:15,210
- They found it.
- I know.

230
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,312
There it is.

231
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,256
There's cops outside.
We better go.

232
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:23,818
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

233
00:33:25,862 --> 00:33:27,321
What do I say?

234
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,277
Tell them...

235
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:45,631
we were doing our job.

236
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:59,269
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

237
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:07,427
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

238
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:10,530
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

239
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,975
Your mother, she--

240
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:15,768
She's not my mother.

241
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:21,398
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

242
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:24,401
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

243
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,879
Not a good half at that.

244
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,124
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

245
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:42,127
They killed my brother.

246
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:46,464
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

247
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,466
He never used to cry.

248
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:52,570
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

249
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:57,558
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

250
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:02,021
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

251
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,373
But they smell like shit.

252
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,693
Not true.

253
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:12,364
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

254
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,324
that's very clean...

255
00:35:14,424 --> 00:35:18,595
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

256
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:21,998
Yes, I do.

257
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:25,293
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

258
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:28,813
Don't move.
I'll get him.

259
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,733
Piggy, where are you?

260
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:36,278
There you are.

261
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:46,188
Hi, Mathilda.

262
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,999
Hi, piggy.

263
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:59,701
How are you today?

264
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:02,303
I've seen better days.

265
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:14,315
- What's your name?
- Leon.

266
00:36:16,692 --> 00:36:18,777
Cute name.

267
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:29,788
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

268
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,384
I'm gonna get some more milk.

269
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:03,570
Holy shit.

270
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:13,480
Don't touch that, please.

271
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,999
What do you do for a living?

272
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,543
Cleaner.

273
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,880
You're a hit man?

274
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,968
Cool.

275
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:43,967
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

276
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,179
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirt bags...

277
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:50,015
who killed my brother?

278
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:53,852
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

279
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:58,023
How about I work for you...

280
00:37:58,123 --> 00:38:01,609
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

281
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:04,737
What do you think?

282
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:06,823
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

283
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,175
I'll even wash your clothes.

284
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:14,805
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

285
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:27,134
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

286
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:31,029
You've had a rough day today.

287
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,493
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

288
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:54,076
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

289
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:57,121
and it's not always like that.

290
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:59,139
You know?

291
00:39:06,855 --> 00:39:08,273
Good night.

292
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,873
You sleep well?

293
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,292
Good.

294
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,795
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

295
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:34,522
Not my problem.

296
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,371
Read it.

297
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:59,238
You don't know how to read.

298
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:02,324
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

299
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:05,410
so I'm a little behind.

300
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,995
What's it say?

301
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:11,082
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

302
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:15,629
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

303
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:20,483
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

304
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:24,178
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

305
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:27,240
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

306
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:33,521
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

307
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:36,232
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

308
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:39,193
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

309
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:42,529
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

310
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:46,033
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

311
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,827
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

312
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:51,788
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

313
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:57,268
But you did open it. So--

314
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:04,842
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

315
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:07,194
I don't wanna die tonight.

316
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,224
You're just a little girl.

317
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:15,186
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

318
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:16,745
I'm sorry.

319
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:37,432
How's that?

320
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,451
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

321
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:15,927
You got that?

322
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,598
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

323
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,642
There is rules.

324
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,479
And stop saying “okay”
all the time!

325
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,150
Good.

326
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,667
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

327
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:53,613
Mister, I have to use it...

328
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:57,826
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

329
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,119
and I have to practice.

330
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:04,056
Okay, but not after 10:00.

331
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:06,183
- I promise.
- All right.

332
00:44:08,227 --> 00:44:11,172
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

333
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:15,301
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

334
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:16,944
Fill those out, please.

335
00:44:21,073 --> 00:44:26,119
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

336
00:44:29,664 --> 00:44:31,816
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

337
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,152
Fourth floor!

338
00:44:34,252 --> 00:44:35,779
Thanks, mister!

339
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:39,048
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

340
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:44,846
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

341
00:44:50,476 --> 00:44:53,504
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

342
00:44:53,604 --> 00:44:55,356
Of course.

343
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:19,545
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

344
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:25,676
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

345
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:45,278
There. Finished.

346
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:48,823
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

347
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:52,619
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

348
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:57,957
No. You just look a little young.

349
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,418
Thanks.

350
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:11,162
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

351
00:46:11,262 --> 00:46:13,514
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

352
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:18,085
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

353
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:22,214
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

354
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:26,426
What do you think?
Just the theory.

355
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:28,820
I need this, Leon.

356
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,557
I need time
to get my head together.

357
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:35,493
Yeah, and I need...

358
00:46:41,207 --> 00:46:42,734
a drink.

359
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:45,836
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

360
00:47:10,902 --> 00:47:14,305
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

361
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:16,641
I thought my hearing was going.

362
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:21,604
I says to myself, “Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners”

363
00:47:21,704 --> 00:47:23,481
I like to stay in shape.

364
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:28,027
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

365
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:31,781
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

366
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:34,383
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

367
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:40,847
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

368
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:53,234
Check it.

369
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,388
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

370
00:47:57,488 --> 00:48:00,575
One thing's got nothing to do
with the other. Remember that.

371
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:03,911
I will.

372
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:21,912
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

373
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:25,749
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

374
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:28,043
The closer you get
to being a pro...

375
00:48:28,143 --> 00:48:31,379
the closer you can get
to the client.

376
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:34,941
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

377
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,073
Position.

378
00:49:06,263 --> 00:49:10,083
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

379
00:49:10,183 --> 00:49:12,936
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

380
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:16,756
And always dress down.

381
00:49:16,856 --> 00:49:19,984
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

382
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:27,475
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

383
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:29,643
Who should I hit?

384
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:31,287
Whoever.

385
00:49:38,252 --> 00:49:40,462
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

386
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:43,323
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

387
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:46,885
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

388
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:59,814
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

389
00:50:07,113 --> 00:50:09,532
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

390
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,497
Keep calm.

391
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:23,320
Don't take your eyes off him.

392
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,213
Breathe easy.

393
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:28,591
Watch his movement.

394
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:33,555
Pretend you're running with him.

395
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,685
Try to feel his next movement.

396
00:50:41,312 --> 00:50:44,648
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

397
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:54,600
Now.

398
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,560
Oh, my God!

399
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,272
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

400
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:04,151
One shot. Not bad, huh?

401
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,653
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

402
00:51:06,753 --> 00:51:10,407
Can we try
with real bullets now?

403
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:12,467
Not today.
Let's pack up.

404
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:23,227
Like that.

405
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:08,938
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

406
00:52:50,728 --> 00:52:52,646
“It seemed...

407
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:55,983
to Socrates--”

408
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:05,784
I'll do it.

409
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:22,200
Leon, all we do is work.

410
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,453
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

411
00:53:25,553 --> 00:53:29,165
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

412
00:53:29,265 --> 00:53:33,102
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

413
00:53:46,448 --> 00:53:48,074
Like a virgin

414
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,204
Touched for the very first time

415
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,795
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

416
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:16,710
Happy birthday to you

417
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:21,089
Happy birthday, Mr. President

418
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:23,608
I don't know.

419
00:54:32,408 --> 00:54:34,243
Moustache.

420
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:41,776
I'm singing in the rain

421
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:44,403
Just singing in the rain

422
00:54:44,503 --> 00:54:47,047
- What a beaut--
- Gene Kelly?

423
00:54:48,716 --> 00:54:50,117
Good.

424
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:53,053
Your turn now.

425
00:54:58,517 --> 00:55:00,310
Okay, pilgrim.

426
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,148
Clint Eastwood?

427
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,143
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

428
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:21,147
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

429
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:23,624
Leon, really brilliant.

430
00:55:26,085 --> 00:55:27,962
Amazing.

431
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:47,172
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

432
00:55:47,272 --> 00:55:50,858
Always happy.
No questions.

433
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:55,471
It's like me, you see.

434
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:57,723
No roots.

435
00:55:57,823 --> 00:56:01,619
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

436
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:08,292
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

437
00:56:10,544 --> 00:56:12,045
You're right.

438
00:56:23,473 --> 00:56:24,891
Wait!

439
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:44,326
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

440
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,753
It's been a long time, Leon.

441
00:57:00,634 --> 00:57:02,619
I missed you.

442
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,457
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

443
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:11,586
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

444
00:57:11,686 --> 00:57:14,047
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

445
00:57:14,147 --> 00:57:15,565
Tony...

446
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:23,139
all the money I make,
that you keep for me--

447
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,182
You need some money?

448
00:57:25,282 --> 00:57:26,851
Just curious.

449
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:28,852
I've been working
a long time...

450
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:32,623
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

451
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:40,530
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

452
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,966
You met a woman.

453
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,585
You gotta be careful
with women.

454
00:57:54,685 --> 00:57:57,672
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

455
00:57:57,772 --> 00:58:02,134
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fucking ears...

456
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:05,137
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

457
00:58:05,237 --> 00:58:10,159
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

458
00:58:12,744 --> 00:58:14,980
You know, about my money--

459
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,484
Maybe I could give...

460
00:58:19,584 --> 00:58:21,670
a little...

461
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:25,448
to someone.

462
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:28,676
You know, to help out.

463
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:35,249
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

464
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:39,670
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

465
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,089
No one knocks off old Tony.

466
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:44,675
Besides, with a bank...

467
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:48,012
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

468
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:53,200
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write. It's all in his head.

469
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,813
I know how to read now.

470
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:00,999
That's good, Leon.

471
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,487
Your money's here.

472
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:08,281
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

473
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:12,410
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

474
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:16,956
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

475
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:20,960
All right.
Now let's talk business.

476
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,547
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

477
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:28,734
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

478
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:54,409
Listen, Mathilda,
you gotta be careful.

479
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:57,053
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

480
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:01,082
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

481
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:03,893
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

482
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,922
I want you to stop cursing.

483
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:10,257
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

484
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,443
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

485
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,451
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

486
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,793
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

487
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,635
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

488
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:57,277
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

489
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:03,099
It's the first time for me,
you know.

490
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,519
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

491
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:09,480
'Cause I feel it.

492
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,165
Where?

493
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,712
In my stomach.

494
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:23,077
It's all warm.

495
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:28,390
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

496
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:36,506
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

497
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:39,092
I don't think
it means anything.

498
01:01:39,192 --> 01:01:43,071
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

499
01:02:27,447 --> 01:02:29,449
How's the practicing going?

500
01:02:59,394 --> 01:03:04,466
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

501
01:03:04,566 --> 01:03:06,509
I understand.

502
01:03:06,609 --> 01:03:08,511
But you're doing all right.

503
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:10,555
I haven't received
any complaints.

504
01:03:10,655 --> 01:03:14,909
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

505
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:17,603
That's very smart.

506
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:22,274
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

507
01:03:22,374 --> 01:03:24,501
What does your father do?

508
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:30,365
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

509
01:03:30,465 --> 01:03:33,010
Except he's not really my father.

510
01:03:38,598 --> 01:03:40,350
He's my lover.

511
01:03:44,395 --> 01:03:47,732
Think I'll go for a walk.

512
01:04:02,454 --> 01:04:06,025
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

513
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,194
- Where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J .

514
01:04:09,294 --> 01:04:11,129
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

515
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:15,158
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

516
01:04:15,258 --> 01:04:19,387
You got plans?

517
01:04:24,726 --> 01:04:26,644
Meet you here?

518
01:05:41,674 --> 01:05:44,202
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

519
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:48,181
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

520
01:05:49,265 --> 01:05:52,085
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

521
01:05:52,185 --> 01:05:54,395
Bang, we shot him.

522
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:00,551
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

523
01:06:00,651 --> 01:06:03,137
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

524
01:06:03,237 --> 01:06:05,139
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

525
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:07,266
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

526
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:09,451
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

527
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:15,107
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

528
01:06:15,207 --> 01:06:17,626
Cooperation.

529
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:24,924
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

530
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:29,679
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

531
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:42,858
Kids should be at school.

532
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:46,595
Come on, that's my ball!

533
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:51,183
Give that back.
Where you going?

534
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:54,703
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!

535
01:07:01,459 --> 01:07:03,403
Follow the blue car.

536
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:06,656
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

537
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,241
No, drive slowly.

538
01:07:08,341 --> 01:07:11,177
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

539
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:47,837
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.

540
01:07:49,922 --> 01:07:54,218
Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!

541
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:01,333
- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...

542
01:08:01,433 --> 01:08:04,503
our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.

543
01:08:04,603 --> 01:08:06,563
I'm Bianca Ferrar.

544
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:14,196
It's for you.
A present.

545
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:19,951
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

546
01:08:24,956 --> 01:08:28,568
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

547
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:30,670
Mr. McGuffin?

548
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:35,674
Can I have a word with you?

549
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:59,155
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

550
01:09:59,255 --> 01:10:02,157
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

551
01:10:02,257 --> 01:10:05,302
in the D.E.A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.

552
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,764
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

553
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,600
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

554
01:10:11,725 --> 01:10:13,543
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

555
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:16,213
I never lend out my gear.

556
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:18,131
But...

557
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:20,216
you still have your gun.
Use it.

558
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,720
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

559
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,239
Why are you so mean to me?

560
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:30,351
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

561
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:34,163
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

562
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:37,666
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

563
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,945
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

564
01:10:41,045 --> 01:10:44,031
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

565
01:10:44,131 --> 01:10:46,116
you expect me to forget?

566
01:10:46,216 --> 01:10:48,285
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

567
01:10:48,385 --> 01:10:50,162
Blow their fucking heads off.

568
01:10:50,262 --> 01:10:53,265
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

569
01:10:55,392 --> 01:10:58,311
Your life is changed forever.

570
01:10:59,938 --> 01:11:03,800
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

571
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,611
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

572
01:11:07,528 --> 01:11:09,614
I want love...

573
01:11:09,906 --> 01:11:11,866
or death.

574
01:11:12,783 --> 01:11:14,410
That's it.

575
01:11:16,162 --> 01:11:18,372
I want death.

576
01:11:18,872 --> 01:11:22,251
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

577
01:11:26,004 --> 01:11:28,115
There's this really great game, Leon.

578
01:11:28,215 --> 01:11:31,718
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

579
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:38,433
The kind of game you love.

580
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,655
If I win...

581
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:56,617
you keep me with you...
for life.

582
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:00,354
And if you lose?

583
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:03,916
Go shopping alone, like before.

584
01:12:05,918 --> 01:12:08,462
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

585
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:12,866
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

586
01:12:12,966 --> 01:12:14,326
So what?

587
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:17,429
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

588
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,766
Nothing.

589
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:27,855
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

590
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:32,485
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

591
01:12:35,529 --> 01:12:37,556
Because if there is...

592
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:40,909
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

593
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,373
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

594
01:12:56,216 --> 01:12:58,259
I love you, Leon.

595
01:13:15,317 --> 01:13:16,694
I win.

596
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,629
I took a hit.

597
01:13:37,338 --> 01:13:39,741
I need a hand now.

598
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:43,953
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

599
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,164
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

600
01:13:46,264 --> 01:13:49,500
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

601
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,502
She's 18.

602
01:13:51,602 --> 01:13:53,521
Really?

603
01:13:57,274 --> 01:13:59,051
How about something to drink, Tony?

604
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:02,654
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

605
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,117
Nice tattoo.

606
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:15,208
Manolo, make that two.

607
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:37,563
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

608
01:14:38,605 --> 01:14:40,549
First you find out
where the chain is.

609
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:44,011
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

610
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:46,822
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

611
01:14:47,823 --> 01:14:49,574
Whatever you want.

612
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,562
- Yes?
- Hi.

613
01:14:53,662 --> 01:14:55,563
It's Susan.

614
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:58,900
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

615
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,361
I don't know any Susan.

616
01:15:01,461 --> 01:15:05,448
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

617
01:15:05,548 --> 01:15:08,159
The light's out.

618
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:10,136
It's all dark out here.

619
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:17,977
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

620
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:25,359
What the fuck are you doing?

621
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:31,907
Open up.

622
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,786
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?

623
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,516
Here's okay.
Let it go.

624
01:16:16,616 --> 01:16:18,977
I said, “Let it go.”

625
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:21,496
Move. Move over.

626
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:24,440
Easy. Easy.

627
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,543
Easy. Careful.
You want me--

628
01:16:29,045 --> 01:16:31,839
Go ahead. Your turn.

629
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:41,165
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

630
01:16:41,265 --> 01:16:43,809
Sir?

631
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:48,964
Sir, it's not my dope.

632
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,007
Sir, look I--

633
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:52,984
A little left, please.

634
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:58,072
Before-- Ple--

635
01:17:00,742 --> 01:17:03,619
Now, the security shot.

636
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,610
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

637
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,029
Aim for the heart and lungs.

638
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,156
There. Right there.
You see?

639
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:18,117
The first shot takes him
out of order.

640
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,120
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

641
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:22,663
Never in the face.

642
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:25,999
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

643
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:29,711
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

644
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,505
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

645
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:36,051
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

646
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,386
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

647
01:17:38,486 --> 01:17:40,988
What are you fucking--

648
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:46,686
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

649
01:17:46,786 --> 01:17:49,021
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

650
01:17:49,121 --> 01:17:52,024
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

651
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:54,793
A damp, black cloth is the best.

652
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:00,115
What you doing?

653
01:18:00,215 --> 01:18:03,410
We said no women, no kids.

654
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:07,180
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

655
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:25,072
Now it's clean.

656
01:18:26,157 --> 01:18:28,951
Let's get out of here.

657
01:18:42,422 --> 01:18:44,324
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

658
01:18:44,424 --> 01:18:48,512
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

659
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:56,002
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

660
01:18:56,102 --> 01:18:59,897
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

661
01:19:03,568 --> 01:19:05,528
Yes.

662
01:19:06,612 --> 01:19:08,306
What you doing?

663
01:19:08,406 --> 01:19:10,850
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

664
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,686
Come on. Just a kiss.

665
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:17,122
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

666
01:19:19,124 --> 01:19:22,044
Go sit down.

667
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:31,094
Enjoy.

668
01:19:36,683 --> 01:19:39,586
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

669
01:19:39,686 --> 01:19:44,674
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

670
01:19:44,774 --> 01:19:48,611
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

671
01:19:49,904 --> 01:19:53,849
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

672
01:19:53,949 --> 01:19:56,560
Nineteen.

673
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,537
Beat you.

674
01:21:03,057 --> 01:21:07,478
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

675
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:58,026
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

676
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:04,699
- Yes?
- Hi.

677
01:22:05,158 --> 01:22:07,060
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

678
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,897
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

679
01:22:10,997 --> 01:22:12,957
Just a second.

680
01:22:25,011 --> 01:22:28,331
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

681
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:31,225
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

682
01:22:35,729 --> 01:22:39,091
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

683
01:22:39,191 --> 01:22:43,278
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

684
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:46,139
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

685
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,575
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

686
01:22:49,826 --> 01:22:52,103
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

687
01:22:52,203 --> 01:22:54,647
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

688
01:22:54,747 --> 01:22:56,708
Show it to me, motherfucker.

689
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:08,677
That's the ring trick.

690
01:23:22,524 --> 01:23:26,570
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

691
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:41,042
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

692
01:23:43,878 --> 01:23:46,864
Nicer than people, eh?

693
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:48,924
I told you that.

694
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:53,053
You got a problem?

695
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:57,933
Get the chair. Sit down.

696
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:07,067
I was thinking.

697
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,348
If something happens
to me someday--

698
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:17,310
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

699
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:20,313
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

700
01:24:20,413 --> 01:24:24,583
Tony, I thought about my money.

701
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:33,342
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

702
01:24:37,804 --> 01:24:42,668
Her name is Mathilda.

703
01:24:42,768 --> 01:24:46,046
If anything happens to me...

704
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:50,275
I'd like you...

705
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:54,279
to give her...

706
01:24:55,947 --> 01:24:58,616
my money.

707
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,521
You can count on me, Leon.

708
01:25:03,621 --> 01:25:06,040
Thank you, Tony.

709
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,295
I won't be long.

710
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:15,716
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

711
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:19,803
This one is too big.

712
01:25:20,554 --> 01:25:23,932
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

713
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:28,128
Mathilda, since I met you...

714
01:25:28,228 --> 01:25:30,313
everything's been different.

715
01:25:30,563 --> 01:25:34,943
So I just need some time alone.

716
01:25:37,737 --> 01:25:39,722
You need some time
to grow up a little.

717
01:25:39,822 --> 01:25:42,475
I finished growing up, Leon.

718
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:44,393
I just get older.

719
01:25:44,493 --> 01:25:47,955
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

720
01:25:49,665 --> 01:25:51,709
I need time to grow up.

721
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:08,808
Shit.

722
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,299
Come on! Hustle!

723
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,178
- Good shot.
- Come on.

724
01:27:33,473 --> 01:27:36,059
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

725
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:39,087
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

726
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,547
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

727
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:44,692
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

728
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:46,861
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

729
01:27:46,986 --> 01:27:50,472
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

730
01:27:50,572 --> 01:27:52,199
a month.

731
01:27:54,493 --> 01:27:56,370
Got change?

732
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:00,107
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

733
01:28:00,207 --> 01:28:02,401
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

734
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:04,044
Okay, a year.

735
01:28:04,878 --> 01:28:07,964
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

736
01:28:11,176 --> 01:28:13,678
So go play somewhere else.

737
01:28:17,056 --> 01:28:19,392
I need to think.

738
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:19,533
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

739
01:29:29,542 --> 01:29:30,960
Food.

740
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:39,202
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

741
01:29:39,302 --> 01:29:40,912
Sign here.

742
01:29:41,012 --> 01:29:42,555
Come here.

743
01:29:45,224 --> 01:29:49,253
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

744
01:29:49,353 --> 01:29:51,313
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

745
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:13,292
Special delivery?

746
01:31:13,392 --> 01:31:15,352
Let me guess.

747
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:18,980
Chinese?

748
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,152
Thai, maybe?

749
01:31:26,821 --> 01:31:29,616
I've got it.

750
01:31:29,741 --> 01:31:31,909
Italian food.

751
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:50,511
What's your name, angel?

752
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:23,709
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

753
01:32:29,173 --> 01:32:30,591
Good.

754
01:32:33,218 --> 01:32:38,248
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

755
01:32:38,348 --> 01:32:41,251
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

756
01:32:41,351 --> 01:32:45,980
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

757
01:32:48,358 --> 01:32:50,360
So this is something...

758
01:32:52,236 --> 01:32:54,697
personal, is it?

759
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:02,772
What filthy piece of shit...

760
01:33:02,872 --> 01:33:04,774
did I do now?

761
01:33:04,874 --> 01:33:08,127
You killed my brother.

762
01:33:12,089 --> 01:33:14,007
I'm sorry.

763
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,976
And you wanna join him?

764
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:32,650
It's always the same thing.

765
01:33:37,071 --> 01:33:41,934
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

766
01:33:42,034 --> 01:33:45,521
that you learn
to appreciate life.

767
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:50,042
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

768
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,300
That's good.

769
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:07,225
Because I take no pleasure...

770
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,879
in taking a life...

771
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:16,984
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

772
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:29,938
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

773
01:34:30,038 --> 01:34:33,317
- I checked upstairs--
- What? I'm busy.

774
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:36,253
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

775
01:34:38,463 --> 01:34:41,658
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

776
01:34:41,758 --> 01:34:44,577
But they got nothing
to do with it.

777
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:50,541
They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.

778
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:53,711
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

779
01:34:53,811 --> 01:34:56,689
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.

780
01:34:56,814 --> 01:35:00,384
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

781
01:35:00,484 --> 01:35:03,304
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like--

782
01:35:03,404 --> 01:35:05,572
No women, no kids.

783
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:16,458
I think
it was something personal.

784
01:35:17,834 --> 01:35:23,131
Death is whimsical today.

785
01:35:50,199 --> 01:35:53,810
Blood, do you hear me?

786
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:58,315
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

787
01:35:58,415 --> 01:36:00,917
Would you take her
up to my office?

788
01:36:02,585 --> 01:36:04,129
All right.

789
01:36:12,512 --> 01:36:14,639
Jesus fucking Christ.

790
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,385
“Leon, my love.

791
01:36:28,485 --> 01:36:30,888
I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.

792
01:36:30,988 --> 01:36:35,684
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D.E.A. building, room 4602.

793
01:36:35,784 --> 01:36:37,686
I'm gonna do them myself.

794
01:36:37,786 --> 01:36:41,565
If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.

795
01:36:41,665 --> 01:36:45,610
It's for a contract.
Five grand ahead, right?

796
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:49,572
I know I'll feel better
after I do this.

797
01:36:49,672 --> 01:36:51,632
I love you.”

798
01:36:56,637 --> 01:36:58,497
Wait. I won't be long.

799
01:36:58,597 --> 01:37:01,851
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

800
01:37:06,438 --> 01:37:09,758
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

801
01:37:09,858 --> 01:37:12,427
A nine “millie.”

802
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:14,638
Bullets.

803
01:37:14,738 --> 01:37:16,114
Another nine “millie.”

804
01:37:19,576 --> 01:37:21,603
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

805
01:37:21,703 --> 01:37:24,706
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

806
01:37:28,835 --> 01:37:30,653
Holy shit!

807
01:37:30,753 --> 01:37:32,421
What's this? Lunch.

808
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,076
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

809
01:37:37,176 --> 01:37:39,136
There's no anchovies on this.

810
01:37:56,611 --> 01:38:00,348
Is that what you call “I won't be long”?
I been here for ten minutes.

811
01:38:00,448 --> 01:38:03,118
I did my best.

812
01:38:50,830 --> 01:38:52,290
Do you like it?

813
01:38:54,166 --> 01:38:55,376
Yes.

814
01:38:56,002 --> 01:38:57,962
So say it.

815
01:39:00,464 --> 01:39:01,966
I like it.

816
01:39:16,855 --> 01:39:18,189
Not thirsty?

817
01:39:27,573 --> 01:39:30,643
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

818
01:39:30,743 --> 01:39:33,813
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

819
01:39:33,913 --> 01:39:36,999
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

820
01:39:37,333 --> 01:39:40,753
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

821
01:39:42,004 --> 01:39:45,174
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

822
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:48,577
They just did it to show off.

823
01:39:48,677 --> 01:39:52,514
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

824
01:39:56,601 --> 01:39:59,187
Will I like it the first time?

825
01:40:03,316 --> 01:40:05,318
Mathilda, no.

826
01:40:07,278 --> 01:40:09,280
Why not?

827
01:40:09,697 --> 01:40:11,866
I just can't.

828
01:40:12,909 --> 01:40:15,411
- You love someone else?
- No.

829
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:18,164
I mean--

830
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:24,378
There was someone a long time ago.

831
01:40:25,629 --> 01:40:27,965
Before I came to the States.

832
01:40:28,423 --> 01:40:31,677
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

833
01:40:32,552 --> 01:40:36,014
She was from
a very respectable family.

834
01:40:37,223 --> 01:40:38,683
Mine was...

835
01:40:39,559 --> 01:40:41,394
you know...

836
01:40:43,062 --> 01:40:44,756
not so respectable.

837
01:40:44,856 --> 01:40:48,676
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

838
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:51,070
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

839
01:40:52,905 --> 01:40:54,223
Right.

840
01:40:54,323 --> 01:40:56,742
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

841
01:40:59,161 --> 01:41:01,205
He killed her.

842
01:41:01,872 --> 01:41:03,957
One shot through the head.

843
01:41:07,502 --> 01:41:11,715
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

844
01:41:13,633 --> 01:41:15,844
They said it was an accident.

845
01:41:18,013 --> 01:41:19,514
So...

846
01:41:21,224 --> 01:41:23,309
one night I...

847
01:41:23,726 --> 01:41:25,687
waited for him.

848
01:41:27,063 --> 01:41:29,440
Five hundred feet with a lens.

849
01:41:32,276 --> 01:41:34,111
He also had an accident.

850
01:41:35,404 --> 01:41:39,016
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

851
01:41:39,116 --> 01:41:43,287
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

852
01:41:43,704 --> 01:41:45,998
I was 19.

853
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:53,296
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

854
01:41:56,967 --> 01:41:59,344
I've never had another girlfriend.

855
01:42:02,305 --> 01:42:04,958
You see, Mathilda...

856
01:42:05,058 --> 01:42:07,143
I wouldn't be a good lover.

857
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,147
Okay.

858
01:42:14,275 --> 01:42:16,469
Would you do me one favor?

859
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:18,012
What?

860
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,472
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

861
01:42:20,572 --> 01:42:22,741
We're gonna share the bed.

862
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:26,036
I don't think it's a good idea.

863
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:29,331
It's okay.

864
01:42:29,456 --> 01:42:31,733
Put your legs up on the bed.

865
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:33,919
Yeah. That's nice.

866
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,717
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

867
01:43:02,446 --> 01:43:04,448
Good night, Leon.

868
01:43:07,326 --> 01:43:09,202
Good night.

869
01:43:31,724 --> 01:43:33,934
I want a piece of cake first!

870
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:43,152
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

871
01:44:02,295 --> 01:44:05,281
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

872
01:44:05,381 --> 01:44:07,909
When you've killed for us
in the past...

873
01:44:08,009 --> 01:44:11,496
we've always been satisfied.

874
01:44:11,596 --> 01:44:17,168
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

875
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:19,228
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

876
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,344
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

877
01:44:27,444 --> 01:44:30,555
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

878
01:44:30,655 --> 01:44:34,451
was kind of the Italian type.

879
01:44:34,576 --> 01:44:38,396
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

880
01:44:38,496 --> 01:44:40,899
Wait. There's more.

881
01:44:40,999 --> 01:44:43,167
You're gonna love this.

882
01:44:45,503 --> 01:44:50,825
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

883
01:44:50,925 --> 01:44:55,663
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

884
01:44:55,763 --> 01:44:59,475
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

885
01:45:00,768 --> 01:45:02,920
The very same...

886
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,147
Italian hit man.

887
01:45:09,776 --> 01:45:12,195
I'm dying to meet him.

888
01:45:16,908 --> 01:45:21,229
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

889
01:45:21,329 --> 01:45:25,483
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

890
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:27,568
Yeah, I forgot.

891
01:45:27,668 --> 01:45:30,546
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

892
01:45:32,131 --> 01:45:35,050
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

893
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,680
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

894
01:45:39,805 --> 01:45:41,624
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

895
01:45:41,724 --> 01:45:44,226
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

896
01:45:44,351 --> 01:45:45,769
Right.

897
01:46:04,162 --> 01:46:09,125
Hola señor! Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

898
01:46:29,436 --> 01:46:31,380
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

899
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,342
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

900
01:46:35,442 --> 01:46:37,986
Is he alone?

901
01:46:38,111 --> 01:46:40,221
Does he expect you?

902
01:46:40,321 --> 01:46:43,516
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

903
01:46:43,616 --> 01:46:46,911
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

904
01:47:34,999 --> 01:47:36,333
Alpha team.

905
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:40,045
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.

906
01:48:27,132 --> 01:48:30,260
What up? Move! Fuck.

907
01:48:35,598 --> 01:48:37,433
Shit.

908
01:48:38,893 --> 01:48:40,895
Alpha team. Man down.

909
01:48:42,146 --> 01:48:44,273
I told you.

910
01:48:48,152 --> 01:48:50,888
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, “everyone”?

911
01:48:50,988 --> 01:48:53,449
Everyone!

912
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:49,211
Take this.

913
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:58,094
Go take a look.

914
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:15,527
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

915
01:50:17,404 --> 01:50:21,325
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

916
01:50:24,369 --> 01:50:25,938
Nobody moves.

917
01:50:26,038 --> 01:50:28,874
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

918
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:34,754
Okay, the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.

919
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:48,184
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

920
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,564
You're coming with us.

921
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,619
Christ, he shot him!

922
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,456
Bastard!

923
01:51:20,548 --> 01:51:22,008
Move!

924
01:51:26,053 --> 01:51:28,164
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

925
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:30,391
Come!

926
01:51:31,517 --> 01:51:35,229
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

927
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:48,975
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

928
01:51:49,075 --> 01:51:54,664
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

929
01:51:56,457 --> 01:51:58,585
Stay away from the window.

930
01:52:44,962 --> 01:52:46,339
Come here.

931
01:52:48,883 --> 01:52:50,301
Snipers.

932
01:52:52,386 --> 01:52:56,265
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

933
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:17,827
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

934
01:54:18,343 --> 01:54:21,955
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

935
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:25,792
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting--

936
01:54:25,892 --> 01:54:30,939
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

937
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:34,718
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

938
01:54:34,818 --> 01:54:37,011
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

939
01:54:37,111 --> 01:54:39,889
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

940
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:42,600
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

941
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:44,143
Go.

942
01:54:44,243 --> 01:54:47,538
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

943
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:54,945
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

944
01:54:55,045 --> 01:54:56,947
You've given me
a taste for life.

945
01:54:57,047 --> 01:55:00,325
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

946
01:55:00,425 --> 01:55:02,511
You'll never be alone again.

947
01:55:05,847 --> 01:55:09,100
Please, go now, baby. Go.

948
01:55:11,186 --> 01:55:13,646
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

949
01:55:16,316 --> 01:55:20,361
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

950
01:55:26,033 --> 01:55:28,227
I love you, Mathilda.

951
01:55:28,327 --> 01:55:30,371
I love you, too, Leon.

952
01:56:05,363 --> 01:56:10,910
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

953
01:56:31,137 --> 01:56:33,264
We've got one breathing here!

954
01:56:35,099 --> 01:56:37,352
Get a medic on the horn!

955
01:56:40,813 --> 01:56:43,190
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

956
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:49,655
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

957
01:56:52,825 --> 01:56:54,435
Let's go! Move!

958
01:56:54,535 --> 01:56:56,353
Get that guy off the stairs!

959
01:56:56,453 --> 01:56:59,898
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

960
01:56:59,998 --> 01:57:03,085
We've got two men coming
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

961
01:57:24,855 --> 01:57:28,634
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

962
01:57:28,734 --> 01:57:30,761
Move your fucking asses.

963
01:57:30,861 --> 01:57:33,264
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

964
01:57:33,364 --> 01:57:35,683
Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.

965
01:57:35,783 --> 01:57:37,226
You got it.

966
01:57:37,326 --> 01:57:40,938
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

967
01:57:41,038 --> 01:57:42,539
Did you find the girl?

968
01:57:51,798 --> 01:57:54,425
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

969
01:57:57,345 --> 01:58:01,416
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here--

970
01:58:01,516 --> 01:58:04,769
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

971
01:58:07,229 --> 01:58:10,441
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

972
01:58:13,652 --> 01:58:16,780
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

973
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:35,657
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

974
01:58:35,757 --> 01:58:39,202
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

975
01:58:39,302 --> 01:58:43,264
You're all right.
Sit tight.

976
01:58:49,019 --> 01:58:54,525
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

977
01:59:18,965 --> 01:59:22,051
Clear the way, men.

978
01:59:31,143 --> 01:59:33,479
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

979
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,126
Stansfield?

980
02:01:26,962 --> 02:01:29,089
At your service.

981
02:01:37,723 --> 02:01:41,643
This is from...

982
02:01:47,774 --> 02:01:50,026
Mathilda.

983
02:02:05,124 --> 02:02:06,959
Shit.

984
02:02:28,438 --> 02:02:29,856
Get out of here!

985
02:02:33,192 --> 02:02:36,095
Leon asked me
to help you out...

986
02:02:36,195 --> 02:02:40,057
if something happened,
and I think something happened.

987
02:02:40,157 --> 02:02:43,936
He put aside
a little cash for you.

988
02:02:44,036 --> 02:02:47,148
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

989
02:02:47,248 --> 02:02:49,692
seeing as how
you're still so young...

990
02:02:49,792 --> 02:02:52,653
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

991
02:02:52,753 --> 02:02:54,863
Like a bank, you know, except...

992
02:02:54,963 --> 02:02:59,034
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

993
02:02:59,134 --> 02:03:01,787
No one knocks off old Tony.

994
02:03:01,887 --> 02:03:04,539
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

995
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,501
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

996
02:03:08,601 --> 02:03:12,438
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

997
02:03:13,564 --> 02:03:14,966
Here.

998
02:03:15,066 --> 02:03:20,513
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

999
02:03:20,613 --> 02:03:25,518
A job?
What the hell can you do?

1000
02:03:25,618 --> 02:03:27,453
I can clean.

1001
02:03:28,829 --> 02:03:31,273
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

1002
02:03:31,373 --> 02:03:33,442
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1003
02:03:33,542 --> 02:03:36,195
It's over!
The game's over!

1004
02:03:36,295 --> 02:03:39,072
Leon's dead!

1005
02:03:39,172 --> 02:03:41,133
You hear me?

1006
02:03:48,306 --> 02:03:53,061
Come on. You think
I ain't hurting too?

1007
02:03:58,524 --> 02:04:00,885
But he's dead.

1008
02:04:00,985 --> 02:04:04,905
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1009
02:04:06,198 --> 02:04:09,226
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1010
02:04:09,326 --> 02:04:11,395
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

1011
02:04:11,495 --> 02:04:15,832
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1012
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:10,493
My parents...

1013
02:05:10,593 --> 02:05:12,662
died...

1014
02:05:12,762 --> 02:05:17,333
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1015
02:05:17,433 --> 02:05:19,393
It was terrible.

1016
02:05:21,937 --> 02:05:25,674
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1017
02:05:25,774 --> 02:05:30,471
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1018
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:33,849
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1019
02:05:33,949 --> 02:05:39,079
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1020
02:05:40,914 --> 02:05:43,608
But on one condition:

1021
02:05:43,708 --> 02:05:46,861
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

1022
02:05:46,961 --> 02:05:49,114
I want you to take a chance...

1023
02:05:49,214 --> 02:05:52,075
and trust me.

1024
02:05:52,175 --> 02:05:54,719
Tell me what happened to you.

1025
02:05:58,097 --> 02:06:01,208
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. officers...

1026
02:06:01,308 --> 02:06:04,670
because of a drug problem.

1027
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:07,381
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1028
02:06:07,481 --> 02:06:12,219
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1029
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:16,198
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1030
02:06:35,591 --> 02:06:39,220
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1031
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:08,498
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.

1032
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:52,112
