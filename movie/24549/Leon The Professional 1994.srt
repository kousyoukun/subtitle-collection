1
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,620
最近還好嗎，堜龤H
Allora, come stai, Leone?

2
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,810
還不錯
Bene.

3
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,920
讓我們來談生意…
Okay, okay. Let's talk business.

4
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,330
這死胖子想搶莫堹鰶曭漸芛N
This fat bastard is trying to move in on Morizio's business.

5
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,130
你知道，莫堹鰶欓O個講道理的人
And you know, Morizio is a reasonable guy.

6
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,970
他只想談談
He just wants a little conversation.

7
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,800
但這死胖子，什麼也不想聽
But this guy,he don't wanna hear about it.

8
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,770
也許他會聽你的
Maybe he'll listen to you.

9
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,810
他每星期二來城 你星期二有空嗎？
He comes to town every Tuesday. Are you free Tuesday?

10
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,880
我有空
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

11
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,730
很高興再見到你，瓊斯先生
Nice to see you again, Mr Jones.

12
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,480
記住，要幹淨俐落
Remember, neatness counts.

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,600
給你半小時
You got one half hour.

14
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,230
一小時
One hour.

15
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,640
什麼事？
Yeah, what?

16
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,180
我是唐托，在樓下 有個家夥想跟你談
It's Tonto, downstairs. There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

17
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,250
他長什麼樣子？
What's he look like?

18
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,880
很有敵意
Serious.

19
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,960
- 告訴他，我馬上就上去 - 他上來了
- Tell him I'm coming up. - He's coming up.

20
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,200
有個不懷好意的人要上來了
Somebody's coming up. Somebody serious.

21
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,900
米奇，眼睛睜大些 有人來找茬
Mickey, open your eyes. We got company.

22
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,240
有人來找茬
We got company.

23
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,120
來吧
Come on.

24
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,300
停火！
Stop, stop, man!

25
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,400
唐托
Tonto.

26
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,780
快去告訴司機，在後面等我們
Tell the driver to wait for us out back, and hurry up.

27
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,020
- 甜心，出什麼事了？ - 別擔心，寶貝
- Hey sweetie, what's going on? - Don't worry, baby.

28
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,190
沒事的，再睡會兒吧
It's cool. Take a nap.

29
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,850
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

30
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,370
那些混蛋把兩邊的出口都堵住了
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.

31
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,060
檢查一下陽台！
Check the terrace!

32
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,000
- 911緊急事故台 - 快幫幫我
- 911 emergency. - I need help.

33
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,650
- 有人想殺我 - 好的，別掛電話
- Somebody's trying to kill me. - Alright, just stay on the line.

34
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,170
請稍等一下
I'll just be off a moment.

35
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,610
我給你聯絡一位警官
Sir, I'm gonna connect you with an officer.

36
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,130
我是傑佛遜警探 有什麼可以效勞的嗎？
Detective Jefferson. May I help you?

37
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,170
我再打給你
I'll call you back.

38
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,510
冷靜點，老兄 那些箱子埵酗W好的玻利維亞貨
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia sitting in them suitcases over here.

39
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,350
絕對沒摻過 拿去吧，都是你的了
Ain't been cut yet. Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

40
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,160
打這個電話號碼
Dial this number.

41
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,010
我再跟你聯絡，甜心，好嗎？
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?

42
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,070
再見
Bye.

43
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,850
- 喂 - 我是莫堹鰶齱A記得我嗎？
- Hello? - It's Morizio. Remember me?

44
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,510
- 看來你回到城堣F - 是的，我是說，也不算是
- I see you're back in town. - Yeah. No, I mean, no.

45
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,550
我只待一天
Just for today.

46
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,640
那麼我可以肯定的說 今天是你在城堛熙怮嶀@天…
Aha, so it's safe to say today's your last day in town...

47
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,220
我們再也不會見到 你那張死豬臉了
and we'll never see your fat fucking face again.

48
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,890
是的，沒錯
Yeah. Right.

49
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,130
讓我跟我們共同的朋友說句話
Let me speak to our mutual friend.

50
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,800
他想跟你談
He wants to talk to you.

51
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,240
一定要讓他明白，再放他走
Make sure he understands, and let him go.

52
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,990
你明白了嗎？
Do you understand?

53
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,290
- 說出來 - 我明白了
- So say it. - I understand.

54
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,800
很好
Good.

55
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,290
天啊
Jesus.

56
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,050
跟平常一樣兩盒牛奶？
Hola! Qutal amigo? Two milk as usual, eh?

57
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
嗨
Hi.

58
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,740
為什麼要把香煙藏起來？
Why did you hide the cigarette?

59
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,580
這樓埵釩雃h告密者
This building's full of rats.

60
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,680
我不想讓我老爸發現 麻煩夠多了
I didn't want my old man to find out. Got enough problems.

61
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,400
出了什麼事？
What happened?

62
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,740
我騎車不小心摔下來
I fell off my bike.

63
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,220
別告訴我爸我有抽煙，好嗎？
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?

64
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,160
- 為什麼你要這樣對我們？ - 我不知道…
- Why are you doing this to us? - I don't know--

65
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,500
這年頭人們的記性總是有問題 肯定是太陽的緣故
People got memory problems these days. It must be the sun.

66
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,940
- 幾時該幹嘛都得看太陽 - 我不知道這是怎麼回事
- Know when to come out of the sun. - I don't know how it happened.

67
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,010
我該幹什麼？ 我只負責保管貨
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

68
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,940
我保管你們給我的貨 我連碰都沒碰過它
I hold the stuff you give to me. I don't look at it, I don't touch it.

69
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,100
- 我甚至不知道怎麼摻淡 - 聽我說，好嗎？
- I don't even know how to cut it. - Try to follow me, alright?

70
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,770
六月的時候 我們給你的白粉，純度是100%
In June, we gave you the dope. It tests 100 percent pure.

71
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,410
現在是七月份 我們來拿白粉，純度只有90%
Now it's July, we pick up the dope, and it tests 90 percent pure.

72
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,060
六月到七月之間，10%被摻了！
Somewhere between June and July, ten percent turned to cut!

73
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,350
我不知道，這與我無關 你把東西給我，我幫你保管
I don't know. It's none of my business. You give me the stuff, I hold it.

74
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,960
- 我只知道這些 - 你知道，我想幫你的忙…
- That's all I know. - You know I'm trying to help you out here...

75
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,690
但如果你想對這事死不認帳…
but if you're gonna be a hard-ass about it...

76
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,130
那我就得去打擾他
I gotta disturb him.

77
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,470
當他在聽音樂時 最討厭被別人打擾
When he's into his music, he hates being disturbed.

78
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,840
我說的都是實話
I'm telling you the truth.

79
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,140
希望如此，因為他有辦法分辨真假
I hope so, because he's got a talent for sniffing out a lie.

80
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,010
很嚇人的
It's scary.

81
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,180
他就像是有第六感
It's almost like a sixth sense.

82
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,150
你是想改變說法呢 還是真要我去打擾他？
Are you gonna change your tune or I gotta bust into his?

83
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,830
我說的都是實話
I'm telling you the truth.

84
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,870
好吧
All right.

85
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
史丹
Stan.

86
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,240
對不起，他說他沒偷那些白粉
I'm sorry. He said he didn't cut the dope.

87
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,580
他當然沒有
Of course he didn't.

88
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,730
幫我個忙
Just do me a favor.

89
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,810
找出是誰幹的
Find out who did by tomorrow.

90
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,620
在明天中午之前 
Noon.

91
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,550
麥基，等一下
Malky, wait.

92
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,660
我沒有偷你的白粉
I didn't cut your shit.

93
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,190
你自己去查吧
Find out yourself!

94
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,600
你在這媟F什麼？ 進去做功課
What are you doing out here? Get inside and do your homework.

95
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,530
- 我早就做好了 - 是嗎？那就進去幫你姐姐…
- I did it already. - Get inside and help your sister...

96
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,970
收拾該死的房子！
clean up the goddamn house!

97
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,100
還有不要再抽煙了！
And stop smoking cigarettes!

98
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,480
一！
One!

99
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,520
二，深吸一口氣
Two. Take a deep breath in.

100
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,660
呼氣
Take a deep breath out.

101
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,020
- 深呼吸 - 時間到了，該我看電視了
- Take a deep breath. Inhale. - Time's up. My turn.

102
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,630
如果轉台，我就打爛你的臉
Change the channel, and I'll smash your face.

103
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,100
現在是腿部運動，下蹲
Ready for the legs. And down.

104
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,850
對不起，甜心
Sorry, sweetheart.

105
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,710
收緊，放松
Squeeze. Release.

106
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,050
早安，瞌睡蟲
Good morning.

107
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,190
嗨，寶貝
Hi, honey.

108
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,720
甜心，把音量關小點，媽媽頭痛
Sweetheart, turn that down. Mama's got a headache.

109
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,220
- 她不讓我換台 - 她只想看該死的卡通！
- She took my turn. - She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

110
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,250
讓她動動屁股又不會怎樣
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass.

111
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
這埵酗j屁股的人可不是我
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.

112
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,430
二，起來
Two and up.

113
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,940
那個整天沒事做 只會看卡通的…
Can someone who's doing nothing all day but watching cartoons...

114
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,600
能出去買點吃的回來嗎？
move a little ass and go get some food?

115
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,180
- 腿部運動，漂亮極了 - 看你敢不敢再說一次
- Legs. Beautiful. - I dare you to say that again.

116
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,880
- 瑪姬，我有麻煩了 - 這又不是第一次了
- Margie, I think I screwed up. - It wouldn't be the first time.

117
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,820
你總有辦法解決的，對吧？
You always come up with something, right?

118
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,620
沒錯，但這次我有點過份了
I think I went too far this time.

119
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,960
你現在就很過份 我上班要遲到了
You're going too far right now. I'm gonna be late for work.

120
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,460
今天留在家堣u作，如何？
How about working at home today?

121
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,300
感覺一下 就是那樣，收腹
Really feel it. That's it, stomach in.

122
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,000
- 一… - 看我的！
- One-- - Now it's my turn!

123
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,610
- 媽的！ - 她要打我！
Shit! She's gonna hit me!

124
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,410
- 爸爸，她要… - 媽的！把門關上！
- Daddy, she's-- - Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

125
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,450
請別開槍！
Please don't shoot!

126
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,790
臭婊子
Fucking bitch.

127
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,660
- 密卡登！ - 繃緊全身
- Megatron! - Firm up the whole body.

128
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,790
當你繃緊腿的時候 你大腿的肌肉…
When you use the Quadra-Step, your thigh muscles--

129
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,870
- 誰去接一下電話？ - 我沒空！
- Can somebody answer the phone? - I'm busy!

130
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,880
- 喂 - 我是瑪格麗特·麥考麗斯特…
- Hello? - This is Marguerite McCallister...

131
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,420
紐澤西州懷德伍德市 史賓塞學校的校長
headmistress at the Spencer School in Wildwood, New Jersey.

132
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,210
蘭多先生或太太在家嗎？
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

133
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
我就是
This is she.

134
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,490
蘭多太太 你丈夫送瑪蒂達入學時…
Mrs. Lando, when your husband enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...

135
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,860
他告訴我們她是個問題少女
he told us she had troblems.

136
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,520
正如你所知 我們以改變問題少女聞名
As you know, we pride ourselves on turning troubled girls...

137
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,690
把她們教育成健康、有成就的年輕人
into healthy, productive young women.

138
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,700
但如果她們不來上學 我們就無能為力了
But if they are not here, there is very little we can do.

139
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,030
瑪蒂達未經批准 已有兩星期沒來上課了
Mathilda left school without permission nearly two weeks ago.

140
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,040
雖然你丈夫 已預付了一年的學費…
I know your husband paid tuition in advance for a year...

141
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,200
但學校守則上寫得很清楚…
but if you will refer to the rules and regulations manual we sent you...

142
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,250
學生若長期缺席，除非有請過假…
you will see that unless there is a valid excuse for prolonged absence...

143
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,220
否則預繳的學費不能退回
your tuition will be forfeit.

144
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,820
她死了
She's dead.

145
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,750
叫那小鬼快做點事！
Tell that fucking kid to do a little work around here!

146
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,080
收拾幹淨！ 這媔簽o讓我心煩
Clean up! I'm tired of this fucking mess.

147
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,550
快點！
Hurry up!

148
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,190
我為什麼會覺得
Why am I feeling

149
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,230
當事情看起來毫無希望
When things could look black

150
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,600
沒有什麼會可能出錯
That nothing could possibly go wrong

151
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,610
今天是最不尋常的一天
This has been A most unusual day

152
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,840
愛讓我用另一種方式
Love has made me see things

153
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,750
看清周圍的事物
In a different way

154
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,620
生活是否永遠如此艱辛 還是僅僅童年才如此？
Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?

155
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,960
總是這樣艱辛的
Always like this.

156
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,170
留著吧
Keep it.

157
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,080
我要去商店買東西 你要我帶些牛奶嗎？
I'm going grocery shopping. You want some milk?

158
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,380
一誇脫還是兩誇脫？ 買兩盒，對嗎？
One quart or two? It's two, right?

159
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,680
我喜歡這種暴風雨前的寧靜時刻
I like these calm little moments before the storm.

160
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,160
這令我想起貝多芬
It reminds me of Beethoven.

161
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,730
你聽到了嗎？
Can you hear it?

162
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,670
就像你把頭放在草地上…
It's like when you put your head to the grass...

163
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,940
你能聽到小草在生長
you can hear it growing.

164
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,770
你能聽到昆蟲的爬行聲
You can hear the insects.

165
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,540
- 你喜歡貝多芬嗎？ - 很難說
- Do you like Beethoven? - Couldn't really say.

166
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,460
我來為你演奏一些
I'm gonna play you some.

167
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,060
爸爸！
Daddy!

168
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,310
你最好待在這
You better stay here.

169
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,950
我們說好是中午的
We said noon.

170
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,460
已經過了一分鍾了
I've got one minute past.

171
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,520
你不喜歡貝多芬
You don't like Beethoven.

172
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,970
你不知道自己錯過了什麼
You don't know what you're missing.

173
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,540
那種序曲令我情緒激昂
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.

174
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,200
如此有力
So powerful.

175
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,470
但序曲之後，說真的…
But after his openings, to be honest...

176
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,640
就變得有點他媽的枯燥
he does tend to get a little fucking boring.

177
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,910
所以我就不聽了！
That's why I stopped!

178
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,530
搜查這屋子
Toss the apartment.

179
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,020
你是莫劄特的樂迷 我也喜歡他
You're a Mozart fan. I love him too.

180
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,060
我愛莫劄特！
I love Mozart!

181
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,630
你知道，他是奧地利人
He was Austrian, you know.

182
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,500
但他這樣的音樂有點輕快
But for this kind of work, he's a little bit light.

183
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,750
所以我比較愛聽震憾一些的
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

184
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,270
- 酷 - 你他媽的在幹什麼？
- Cool. - Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

185
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,140
老兄，閉上你的臭嘴
Man, keep your bombacut mouth shut.

186
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,050
聽聽布拉姆斯吧，他也不錯
Check out Brahms. He's good too.

187
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,690
- 你他媽的懂什麼音樂？ - 別再吵了！
- What the fuck do you know about music? - Man, knock it off!

188
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,370
- 你檢查過床墊了嗎？ - 沒有
- You check the mattress? - Nope.

189
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,420
喔！他媽的！
Oh! Fuck!

190
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,700
他死了
He's dead.

191
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,140
天啊，看看你幹了什麼！
Jesus. Look what you did.

192
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,140
史丹，你沒事吧？
Stan, you all right?

193
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,240
- 看看你幹了什麼！ - 史丹
- Look what you did. - Stan

194
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,530
史丹，你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

195
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,560
- 他已經死了！ - 但他毀了我的西裝
- He's dead! - But he ruined my suit.

196
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,140
我知道，但他已經死了
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.

197
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,570
他現在只是一灘爛肉 算了吧，冷靜點
He's a piece of meat. Forget about it. Calm down.

198
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,180
我很冷靜
I'm calm.

199
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,470
留在原地別動，好嗎？
Stay there, all right?

200
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,990
好
Okay.

201
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,250
班尼！
Benny!

202
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,060
天啊，班尼！ 是我和史丹！
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny! It's Malky and Stan!

203
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,790
放輕松，好嗎？
Take it easy, all right?

204
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,810
過來
Come on.

205
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,440
我們出去抽支煙吧
Come on, let's get a cigarette.

206
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,010
班尼，我們要出來了！
Benny, we're coming out!

207
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,870
班尼，別開槍！
Benny, don't fire!

208
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,740
進去！
Get in there!

209
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,210
該死的，班尼！
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

210
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,950
你穿著新西裝… 有火嗎？
You wear something new and-- Got a light?

211
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,920
放輕松
Take it easy.

212
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,090
外面發生什麼事了？
What's happening out there?

213
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,320
不要緊，夫人 我們是緝毒署的警察
It's all right, ma'am. D.E.A. Police.

214
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,290
放過那可憐的一家吧
Leave that poor family alone.

215
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,030
- 沒事的，冷靜點 - 我很冷靜，我很冷靜
- Everything's all right. Just calm down. - I am calm. I'm calm.

216
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,330
幹嘛不放過他們呢？
Why don't you leave them alone?

217
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,830
他叫你回屋堨h
He said go back inside.

218
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,380
史丹，不如我們進去吧
Stan, I think it's better if we go inside.

219
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,370
班尼，翻遍廚房 也要找到那些白粉！
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down! Find that shit!

220
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,100
威利，看你幹了什麼！ 你竟然殺死了四歲的小孩！
Willy Blood, look what you did! You killed a 4-year-old kid!

221
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,310
真的有必要這麼做嗎？
Did you really have to do that?

222
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,620
請開門
Please open the door.

223
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,620
求求你
Please.

224
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,620
求求你
Please.

225
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,260
班尼，應該有三個孩子
Benny, there are three kids here.

226
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,660
史丹殺了這個女孩
I think Stan killed this girl.

227
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,300
威利那混蛋殺了小男孩
Willy, that asshole, shot the little boy.

228
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,900
第三個孩子失蹤了 快去找她
The third one's missing. Find her.

229
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,930
媽的，我們遺漏了一個小女孩
Shit. We missed the little girl, man.

230
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,600
我要去找遍這棟樓房
I'm gonna find the fucking super in this goddamn building.

231
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,310
- 你不認識我嗎？ - 我，鋼索，認識你！
- Don't you recognize me? - Me, Grimlock. Know you!

232
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,850
媽的
Shit.

233
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,130
- 我找到了！ - 太好了！
- Yo! I found it! - Bingo!

234
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,320
- 他們找到白粉了 - 我知道
- They found it. - I know.

235
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,360
在這
There it is.

236
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,370
條子來了，我們最好快走
There's cops outside. We better go.

237
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,870
條子來了 我們得走了，你留在這
It's the cops outside. We better go. You stay here.

238
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,910
我該說些什麼？
What do I say?

239
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,390
告訴他們…
Tell them...

240
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,720
我們在執行公務
we were doing our job.

241
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,370
- 你叫什麼名字？ - 瑪蒂達
- What's your name? - Mathilda.

242
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,900
- 很遺憾你父親死了 - 就算這些人不幹掉他…
- Sorry about your father. - If somebody didn't do it...

243
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,620
哪天我可能也會親自動手
one day or another, I would have probably done it myself.

244
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,090
你媽媽，她…
Your mother, she--

245
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,890
她不是我親生母親
She's not my mother.

246
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:21,500
我姐姐一心想要減肥 但總不見起色
My sister wanted to lose some weight. Bet she never looked better.

247
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,700
她也不是我親姐姐 只是同父異母的姐姐
She's not even my real sister. Just a half sister.

248
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,930
她不是個好姐姐
Not a good half at that.

249
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,280
既然你受不了他們 那為何還要哭呢？
If you couldn't stand them, why are you crying?

250
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,320
因為他們殺了我弟弟
They killed my brother.

251
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,620
他到底做了什麼？ 他才只有四歲
What the hell did he do? He was four years old.

252
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,590
他不愛哭
He never used to cry.

253
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,660
他只喜歡黏著我
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

254
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,670
我比那個臭母豬更像他媽媽
I was more of a mother to him than that goddamned pig ever was.

255
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,140
別那樣罵豬 他們通常比人還要好
Don't talk like that about pigs. They're usually nicer than people.

256
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,430
但它們臭氣薰天
But they smell like shit.

257
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,840
不是的
Not true.

258
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,470
事實上，我廚房奡N有一只…
As a matter of fact, right now I have one in my kitchen...

259
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,480
他很幹淨…
that's very clean...

260
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,880
- 而且味道很香 - 你的廚房堥S有豬
- and smells very nice. - You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

261
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,160
有的
Yes, I do.

262
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:25,550
我剛去過廚房 沒有看見任何該死的豬
I was just in there, and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

263
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,900
別走開，我去找他
Don't move. I'll get him.

264
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,050
小豬，你在哪堙H
Piggy, where are you?

265
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,340
找到你了
There you are.

266
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,380
嗨，瑪蒂達
Hi, Mathilda.

267
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,110
嗨，小豬
Hi, piggy.

268
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,790
你今天好嗎？
How are you today?

269
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,430
不是太好
I've seen better days.

270
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,370
- 你叫什麼名字？ - 堜
- What's your name? - Leon.

271
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,140
很可愛的名字
Cute name.

272
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,880
你有其他親人 或者可以投靠的地方嗎？
You have anyone to go to, any family anyplace else?

273
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,510
我再去拿點牛奶
I'm gonna get some more milk.

274
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,590
天啊
Holy shit.

275
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,700
別碰那些，拜托
Don't touch that, please.

276
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,180
堜龤A你到底靠什麼維生的？
What do you do for a living?

277
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,610
清潔工
Cleaner.

278
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,940
你的意思是職業殺手？
You're a hit man?

279
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,140
對
Yeah.

280
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,080
真酷
Cool.

281
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,130
- 什麼人都殺嗎？ - 不殺女人和小孩，這是行規
- Do you clean anyone? - No women, no kids. That's the rules.

282
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,240
請人解決那些殺死我弟弟的人渣…
How much would it cost to hire someone to get those dirt bags...

283
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,140
需要多少錢？
who killed my brother?

284
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,970
五千元一個人頭
- Five grand a head. - Wow.

285
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,140
這樣吧，我替你工作…
How about I work for you...

286
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,720
做為交換 你教我如何做「清潔工作」
and in exchange, you teach me how to clean?

287
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,880
你覺得怎麼樣？
What do you think?

288
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,120
我會幫你收拾房間 我會幫你買東西
I'll clean your place. I'll do the shopping.

289
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,250
甚至幫你洗衣服
I'll even wash your clothes.

290
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,900
- 成交嗎？ - 不，我不答應
- Is it a deal? - No, it's not a deal.

291
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,540
你要我怎麼做？ 我已經無處可去了
What do you want me to do? I've got no place to go.

292
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,380
你今天過得真夠受的
You've had a rough day today.

293
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,890
睡覺去吧，明天再說，好嗎？
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow.

294
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,160
你對我真好，堜龤K
You've been really great with me, Leon...

295
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,210
很少有人對我好
and it's not always like that.

296
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,240
你知道嗎？
You know?

297
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,550
晚安
Good night.

298
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,190
睡得好嗎？
You sleep well?

299
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,360
很好
Good.

300
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,100
- 吃完早餐後，你就得離開這 - 去哪堙H
- After breakfast you gotta take off. - Where to?

301
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,630
不關我的事
Not my problem.

302
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,650
讀吧
Read it.

303
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,330
你不識字？
You don't know how to read.

304
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,580
我正在學，但最近工作很忙…
I'm learning, but I've had a lot of work lately...

305
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,600
所以進度有點落後
so I'm a little behind.

306
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,100
上面寫些什麼？
What's it say?

307
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,230
我決定要做個清潔工
I've decided what to do with my life. I wanna be a cleaner.

308
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:15,810
你要做清潔工？來
You wanna be a cleaner. Here.

309
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,810
拿去吧，這是道別的禮物 去清理吧，但不是跟我
Take it. It's a good-bye gift. Go clean, but not with me.

310
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,280
- 我獨自工作，明白嗎？ - 「雌雄大盜」不是獨自工作
- I work alone. Understand? - Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

311
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,560
「末路狂花」也不單獨行動 他們都是最棒的
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone. They were the best.

312
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:33,620
瑪蒂達，你為什麼要這樣對我？
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?

313
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,360
我一直對你很好
I've been nothing but nice to you.

314
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,500
昨天還在門口救了你一命
I saved your life yesterday, right outside the door.

315
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,640
沒錯，所以現在你有責任
Right. Now you're responsible for it.

316
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,140
你救我一定是有理由的
If you saved my life, you must've saved it for a good reason.

317
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,980
現在如果趕我走 就等於昨天你沒開門…
If you throw me out now, it's like you never opened your door...

318
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,880
讓我死在走道上
like you let me die right there in front of it.

319
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:57,350
但你打開門救了我，所以…
But you did open it. So--

320
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,050
瑪蒂達
Mathilda

321
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,990
如果你不幫我 我今晚就會死，我能感覺到
If you don't help me, I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

322
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,290
我不希望今晚死去
I don't wanna die tonight.

323
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,400
瑪蒂達，你只是個小女孩
You're just a little girl.

324
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,340
請別難過，但我認為你辦不到
Don't take it badly, but I don't think you could do it.

325
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,840
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

326
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,530
怎麼樣？
How's that?

327
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,960
瑪蒂達…
Mathilda

328
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,560
再那樣做就打破你的腦袋
Don't you ever do that again or I'll break your head.

329
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,070
- 明白了嗎？ - 好的
You got that?

330
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,740
那樣做不夠專業
I don't work like that. It's not professional.

331
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:22,740
行有行規
There is rules.

332
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:23,870
好的
Okay.

333
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,570
還有不要一直說「好」，好嗎？
And stop saying okay all the time!

334
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,170
好的
Okay.

335
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,240
很好
Good.

336
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,930
你要在這旅館內用那個東西？
You expect to use that in this hotel?

337
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,770
先生，我必須用它…
Mister, I have to use it...

338
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,930
因為下個月 我要去茱麗亞學院面試…
because I have an audition at Juilliard next month...

339
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,340
我需要練習
and I have to practice.

340
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,210
好吧，但別在十點以後練習
Okay, but not after 10:00.

341
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,320
- 好，我保證 - 好吧
- I promise. - All right.

342
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,320
我讓你們住在走廊盡頭的房間…
I'll put you at the end of the hall...

343
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,450
那樣就不會打擾別人了
so that you don't disturb anyone.

344
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,630
請填妥這張表格
Fill those out, please.

345
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,640
爸爸，讓我來填好嗎？ 我喜歡填旅館的登記表
Daddy, can I please fill them out? I like to check in to hotels.

346
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,240
謝了，老爸，我很快就填好回來
Thanks, Pop. I'll bring these back in a minute.

347
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,270
四樓！
Fourth floor!

348
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,970
謝了，先生！
Thanks, mister!

349
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,510
你真幸運，有個凡事好奇的女兒
You're lucky to have a little girl that's interested in things.

350
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,390
我17歲的兒子還整天遊手好閑
I have a kid, 17, does nothing all day long.

351
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,830
我拿行李上去時 能把這植物暫放在這媔隉H
Can I leave my plant here while I take my stuff upstairs?

352
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,500
當然可以
Of course.

353
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,690
我填上了我最討厭的同學的名字
I'm putting in a name of a girl in my class who makes me sick.

354
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,730
如果出事，她可以當代罪羔羊
If things get hot, she'll take the heat.

355
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,380
填好了
There. Finished.

356
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,620
- 你幾歲了？ - 18歲
- How old are you? - Eighteen.

357
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,030
- 18歲？ - 要看我的身份證嗎？
- Eighteen? - Want to see my license?

358
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,060
不用了，你看起來年輕一些
No. You just look a little young.

359
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,490
謝謝
Thanks.

360
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,270
堜龤A我要你教我如何像你一樣
Leon, I want you to teach me how to be like you.

361
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,940
我要像你一樣強壯和聰明
I want to be strong and smart like you.

362
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,350
瑪蒂達
Mathilda

363
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,250
我知道我還不夠強壯…
I know I'm not strong enough yet...

364
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,380
但我能從基礎學起，理論知識
but I could learn the basics, the theory.

365
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,580
你覺得如何？只是理論知識
What do you think? Just the theory.

366
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,890
我需要這個，堜
I need this, Leon.

367
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,720
我需要時間理清頭緒
I need time to get my head together.

368
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,960
好的，我需要…
Yeah, and I need...

369
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,840
喝的
a drink.

370
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,910
不要動，我去買
Don't move. I'll go get one.

371
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,440
你叫我替你弄這寶貝時…
When you told me to get this baby out for you...

372
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,770
我還以為我聽錯了
I thought my hearing was going.

373
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:21,950
我告訴自己：「堜軉O個行家 只有初學者才會用到這個東西」
I says to myself, Leon's a pro. Nobody uses that except beginners.

374
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,580
我喜歡保持水准
I like to stay in shape.

375
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:28,120
當然，永遠保持巔峰
Sure. Always stay on top of it.

376
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,890
像我一樣 我也一定要掌握事情進度
It's like me. I gotta know where everything is all the time.

377
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,800
所以我從不離開這 除非不得不挪地方
I never leave this place, except to go from here to there.

378
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,100
改變不是一件好事 堜龤A你明白嗎？
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

379
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,310
檢查一下
Check it.

380
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,540
- 確定東西沒錯 - 我信任你
- Make sure it's the right thing. - I trust you.

381
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,220
這兩者不一定有關連，要記住
One thing's got nothing to do with the other. Remember that.

382
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,990
我會記住
I will.

383
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,010
你首先要學會用來福槍…
The rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use...

384
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,910
因為它讓你與目標保持距離
because it lets you keep your distance from the client.

385
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,210
你越專業…
The closer you get to being a pro...

386
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,510
才能越接近目標
the closer you can get to the client.

387
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,420
例如刀子，就是你最後才要學的
The knife, for example, is the last thing you learn.

388
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,490
知道嗎？
Okay?

389
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,790
知道
Okay.

390
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,190
就位
Position.

391
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,420
不對
No.

392
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,220
直到最後一刻才能打開 它會反射亮光
Never take it off until the last minute. It reflects light.

393
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,060
對方在一哩外就能看見你
They can see you coming from a mile away.

394
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,820
永遠穿深色的衣服
And always dress down.

395
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,030
絕不要比地板還明亮，知道嗎？
Never brighter than the floor, okay?

396
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,030
知道
Okay.

397
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,570
開始練習，這是最好的學習方法
Let's practice now. It's the best way to learn.

398
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,740
我該打誰？
Who should I hit?

399
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,400
隨便吧
Whoever.

400
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,620
我馬上來，給我幾分鍾，謝謝
I'll be with you in a second. Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

401
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,420
你們都閃開，我不想看見你們
You guys get lost. I don't want to see you.

402
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,960
- 大家都就位了嗎？ - 要看起來很自然
- Is everyone in position? - This has to look natural.

403
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,940
- 不殺女人和小孩，對嗎？ - 對
- No women, no kids. Right? - Right.

404
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,610
那個穿黃橙色運動服慢跑的人？
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

405
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,810
可以
Okay.

406
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,590
保持冷靜
Keep calm.

407
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,390
視線別離開目標
Don't take your eyes off him.

408
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,290
呼吸放輕松
Breathe easy.

409
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,930
觀察他的動作
Watch his movement.

410
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,610
假想你和他一起在跑
Pretend you're running with him.

411
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,810
試著感受他的下一個動作
Try to feel his next movement.

412
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,750
深呼吸，別動
Take a deep breath. Hold it.

413
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,760
開槍
Now.

414
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,660
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

415
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,430
- 我沒事，我很好 - 趴下！子彈從哪堮g來的？
- I'm all right. I'm fine. - Get down! Where'd that come from?

416
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,270
一槍命中，不錯吧？
One shot. Not bad, huh?

417
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,770
- 是誰在開槍？ - 我透不過氣了！別壓著我
- Who the hell fired? - I just can't breathe! Get off me.

418
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,500
現在能用真子彈了嗎？
Can we try with real bullets now?

419
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,550
今天不行，我們收工吧
Not today. Let's pack up.

420
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,560
就像這樣
Like that.

421
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,070
- 不，謝了 - 不准討價還價
- No, thanks. - No discussion.

422
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,780
那看起來  像是蘇格拉底
"It seemed to Socrates..."

423
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,120
蘇格拉底…
to Socrates--?

424
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,520
蘇-格-拉-底
So-c-ra-tes.

425
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,830
讓我來
I'll do it.

426
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,380
堜龤A我們一直在工作
Leon, all we do is work.

427
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,570
我們需要休息一下，來玩個遊戲吧
We need a break. Let's play a game.

428
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,310
- 什麼樣的遊戲？ - 我有個很棒的遊戲
- What kind of game? - I have this great game.

429
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,520
有助於思考和記憶 正是你所需要的
It makes you think and helps your memory. It's exactly what you need.

430
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:37,610
好吧
Okay.

431
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,460
宛如處女
Like a virgin

432
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,340
第一次被男人撫摸
Touched for the very first time

433
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,160
宛如處女…
Like a virgin

434
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,880
- 是誰？ - 我不知道
- Who is it? - I don't know.

435
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,610
好吧
Okay.

436
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:16,790
祝你生日快樂
Happy birthday to you

437
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,200
祝你生日快樂，總統先生
Happy birthday, Mr. President

438
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,670
我不知道
I don't know.

439
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,350
小胡子
Moustache.

440
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,920
我在雨中歡唱
I'm singing in the rain

441
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,550
就在雨中歡唱
Just singing in the rain

442
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,500
- 如此美… - 金凱利？
- What a beaut-- - Gene Kelly?

443
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,230
答對了
Good.

444
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,130
輪到你了
Your turn now.

445
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,400
好吧，朝聖者
Okay, pilgrim.

446
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,580
克林特·伊斯特伍德？
Clint Eastwood?

447
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,250
- 我不知道，我放棄 - 約翰韋恩
- I don't know. I give up. - John Wayne.

448
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,300
我正要說，我發誓 真令人驚奇
I was just about to say that. I swear. It's amazing.

449
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,760
堜龤A你真有才華
Leon, really brilliant.

450
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,070
真令人驚奇
Amazing.

451
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,290
- 你喜歡這盆植物，是嗎？ - 它是我最好的朋友
- You love your plant, don't you? - It's my best friend.

452
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,980
永遠快樂，不問問題
Always happy. No questions.

453
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,620
它就像我…
It's like me, you see.

454
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,860
沒有根
No roots.

455
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,310
如果你真的喜歡它 就該把它種在公園
If you really love it, you should plant it in a park--

456
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,070
它就能落地生根了
so it can have roots.

457
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,740
如果要我成長 那你也應該給我澆水
You should be watering me if you want me to grow.

458
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,110
你說得對
You're right.

459
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,990
等等！
Wait!

460
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:44,410
得從盤中跳出來，要鮮活
They gotta be jumping out of the plate. They gotta be alive.

461
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,890
好久不見了，堜
It's been a long time, Leon.

462
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,730
我想念你
I missed you.

463
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,630
- 你也錯過了一些好工作 - 我在訓練
- And you missed some nice jobs too. - Been training.

464
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,670
訓練是好事，但別過度了
Training's good, but don't overdo it.

465
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,170
訓練不比工作能賺錢，堜
Training don't pay as good as working, Leon.

466
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,680
湯尼…
Tony...

467
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,240
關於我賺的錢 你幫我保管的那些錢…
all the money I make, that you keep for me--

468
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,350
你需要錢？
You need some money?

469
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,990
不，我只是好奇
Just curious.

470
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,960
我已經工作了很久…
I've been working a long time...

471
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:32,720
從沒用過那些錢
and I haven't done anything with my money.

472
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:40,630
也許有一天我會要用那些錢
I thought maybe someday I could use it.

473
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,070
你認識了個女人？
You met a woman.

474
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,740
堜龤A你要小心女人
You gotta be careful with women.

475
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,790
還記得你剛到這國家的時候嗎？
Remember when you arrived in this country?

476
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,260
當我收留你時，你什麼都不懂…
When I took you in, you were still wet behind the fucking ears...

477
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,290
那時你為了個女人惹了一身麻煩
and, already, you were in deep shit because of a woman.

478
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:10,230
- 別忘了，堜 - 有時我希望能忘掉
- Don't forget that, Leon. - I wish I could sometimes.

479
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,130
你知道，關於我那些錢…
You know, about my money--

480
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:19,570
也許我…也許我可以…
Maybe I could give...

481
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,770
拿一點出來…
a little...

482
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,610
給別人
to someone.

483
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,780
你知道，去幫助別人
You know, to help out.

484
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,360
這是你的錢，我只是幫你保管 就像是銀行一樣
It's your money. I'm just holding it for you, like a bank.

485
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,830
但比銀行好 因為銀行經常會被打劫
Except better than a bank because banks always get knocked off.

486
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,160
而沒人敢打劫老湯尼
No one knocks off old Tony.

487
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:44,770
而且，錢存銀行…
Besides, with a bank...

488
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,130
就經常有無數的表格要填
there's always tons of forms and all that shit.

489
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:53,570
但老湯尼這堙A不用讀，不用寫 全都記在我腦子
But old Tony, nothing to read, nothing to write. It's all in his head.

490
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,940
我現在識字了
I know how to read now.

491
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,140
那很好，堜
That's good, Leon.

492
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,650
你的錢就在這
Your money's here.

493
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,620
無論你何時想要，只要告訴我一聲
Whenever you want it, you just ask me.

494
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:12,590
- 這埵酗@千元 - 沒關系，我不需要
- Here's a grand. Come on. - It's okay. I don't need it.

495
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:17,100
- 拿去吧，去找點樂子，拿著 - 謝謝
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead. - Thank you.

496
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,040
好吧，現在我們來談生意
All right. Now let's talk business.

497
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,640
別走開，我去拿資料
Don't move. I'll go get the file.

498
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,840
馬諾洛，給我朋友堜蠿茠M牛奶
Manolo, a glass of milk for my friend Leon here.

499
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,500
聽著，瑪蒂達，你要小心
Listen, Mathilda, you gotta be careful.

500
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,200
你不能隨便跟街上的人聊天
You can't just speak to any guy off the street.

501
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,210
堜龤A別緊張 有什麼他媽大不了的？
Leon, get a grip. What's the big fucking deal?

502
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:04,010
我只是邊等邊抽煙而已
I was just smoking a butt while I was waiting.

503
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,050
我要你戒掉髒話
I want you to stop cursing.

504
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:10,380
你不能一直這樣跟別人交談
You can't talk to people like that all the time.

505
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,580
我要你努力學習好好說話
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.

506
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,380
好的
Okay.

507
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,530
我要你把煙戒掉，抽煙危害健康
And I want you to stop smoking. It will kill you.

508
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,930
好的
Okay.

509
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,870
離他遠點，他看起來像個怪人
Stay away from him. He looks like a weirdo.

510
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,870
好的
Okay.

511
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,750
我過五分鍾就出來 待在我視線範圍之內
I'll be out in five minutes. Stand where I can see you.

512
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,850
好的
Okay.

513
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:57,330
堜龤A我想我愛上你了
Leon, I think I'm kinda falling in love with you.

514
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,240
這是我的初戀，你知道嗎？
It's the first time for me, you know.

515
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,670
你從沒談過戀愛 怎麼知道這是愛？
How do you know it's love if you've never been in love before?

516
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,610
因為我感覺到
'Cause I feel it.

517
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,270
哪堙H
Where?

518
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:16,820
在我肚子堙K
In my stomach.

519
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:23,190
暖暖的
It's all warm.

520
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,490
以前我老是胃痛 但現在沒有了
I always had a knot there, and now it's gone.

521
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,670
瑪蒂達，我很高興你不再胃痛了
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't have a stomachache anymore.

522
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,210
但那並不代表什麼
I don't think it means anything.

523
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:43,110
我要遲到了 我討厭工作時遲到
I'm late for work. I hate being late for work.

524
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,560
你女兒的小提琴練得怎樣了？
How's the practicing going?

525
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:04,650
- 今天過得好嗎，小姐？ - 我有點厭倦練習了
- How are we today, miss? - A little sick of practicing.

526
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,630
我了解
I understand.

527
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,630
但你做得不錯
But you're doing all right.

528
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,710
我沒有接到任何投訴
I haven't received any complaints.

529
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,340
我在弦上放塊布減少噪音
I put a cloth over the strings to lessen the noise.

530
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,680
那真聰明
That's very smart.

531
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,410
- 不是所有人都愛音樂 - 我知道
- Not everyone loves music. - I know.

532
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:24,610
你父親到底是做什麼的？
What does your father do?

533
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:30,490
- 他是個作曲家 - 真了不起
- He's a composer. - That's wonderful.

534
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,130
他其實不是我父親
Except he's not really my father.

535

They should have been at school, don't you think?

549
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,310
你證詞說你是第一個到達的人

I haven't got time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

Take the hundred bucks, and shut the fuck up.

564

I do not want to fight you, but you leave me no choice.

565

你為什麼要這樣對我？

596

我不在乎睡什麼覺，堜
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.

597

這遊戲真的很棒，堜
There's this really great game, Leon.

它讓人變得更好，讓人開始思考

你喜歡的那種遊戲

如果我贏了…
If I win...

606
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:56,270
你得讓我跟著你…一輩子

如果你輸了呢？
And if you lose?

608
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,540
你和以前一樣，自己去買東西
Go shopping alone, like before.

609
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:08,110
你會輸的，瑪蒂達
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

610
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:12,750
槍膛埵酗@顆子彈，我聽出來了
There's a round in the chamber. I heard it.

611
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,980
那又怎樣？
So what?

612
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:17,620
如果我腦袋中槍死了，你會怎樣？
What's it to you if I end up with a bullet in the head?

613
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,430
沒什麼
Nothing.

614
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,880
我希望你沒說謊，堜
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

615
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:32,130
我真的希望 你內心深處也沒有愛過我
I really hope that deep down inside there's no love in you.

616
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:37,210
因為如果你…
Because if there is...

617
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:40,930
有那麼一點點愛我的話…
just a little bit of love in there for me...

618
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:46,390
那麼幾分鍾後，你就會後悔 從沒說出自己真正的感受
I think that in a few minutes you'll regret you never said anything.

619
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,900
我愛你，堜
I love you, Leon.

現在我需要個幫手

623
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:43,570
我知道她還很小，但她學得很快
I know she's young, but she learns fast.

624
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,400
小孩需要培養，對嗎？
Kids need to be shaped into something, right?

625
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,580
我知道，那是我教你的 但是難道沒有年齡限制嗎？
I know. I taught you that. But ain't there an age limit?

626
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,180
她已經18歲了
She's 18.

627
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:53,180
真的嗎？
Really?

628
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:59,050
來點喝的好嗎，湯尼？
How about something to drink, Tony?

629

631
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:14,870
馬諾洛，兩杯牛奶
Manolo, make that two.

632
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,190
- 幹嘛要戴帽子？ - 我可不能感冒
- What's that for? - Can't afford to catch cold.

633
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,270
首先，找出門鏈在哪
First you find out where the chain is.

634
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:43,700
雖然看不見，但你能感覺得到 這
You can't see it, but you can feel it. Here.

635
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,830
- 我按門鈴，你跟他說話 - 我該說些什麼？
- I'll ring, you start talking. - What do I say?

636
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,270
隨你喜歡
Whatever you want.

637
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,240
- 誰？ - 嗨
- Yes? - Hi.

638
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,250
我是蘇珊
It's Susan.

639
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,840
抱歉，你一定是找錯門了，小姑娘
I'm sorry. You must have the wrong door, little girl.

640
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,020
我不認識什麼蘇珊
I don't know any Susan.

641
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:05,150
退後點，我什麼都看不見
Move back a little. I can't see anything.

642
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,820
走道的燈沒開
The light's out.

643
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,130
外面一片漆黑
It's all dark out here.

644
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:18,240
- 先生，我很害怕 - 好吧
- Mister, I'm scared. - Okay.

645
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,000
你他媽的想幹什麼？
What the fuck are you doing?

646
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:31,880
張開嘴
Open up.

647
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,620
如果它離開了你嘴巴 我就扣扳機，明白了嗎？
If it leaves your mouth, I'll pull the trigger, capisce?

648
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,540
沒問題了，把嘴挪開
Here's okay. Let it go.

649
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:18,660
我說：「把嘴挪開」
I said, Let it go.

650
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:21,130
走，到那邊去
Move. Move over.

651
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,170
放輕松
Easy. Easy.

652
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,170
小心點，你想要我…
Easy. Careful. You want me--

653
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:31,440
上吧，輪到你了

01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,850
救命，求你別殺我
Help me. Please don't beat me.

655
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,490
先生？
Sir?

656
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:48,980
先生，那些白粉不是我的
Sir, it's not my dope.

657
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,030
先生，聽著，我…
Sir, look I--

658
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:52,980
請往左邊一點
A little left, please.

659
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,700
在開槍之前…
Before-- Ple--

660
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:03,870
現在再開一槍，確保目標死亡
Now, the security shot.

661
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:11,280
不，第二槍要射在胸口上方
No, the second goes higher on the chest.

662
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,720
瞄准心髒和肺
Aim for the heart and lungs.

663
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,790
就是那堙A明白了嗎？
There. Right there. You see?

664
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:18,130
第一槍打倒目標
The first shot takes him out of order.

665
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:20,790
- 第二槍就解決他 - 你們他媽的在幹什麼？
- The second finishes him off. - What are you fucking doing?

666
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,360
千萬別射臉
Never in the face.

667
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:25,660
如果目標無法辨認 你就拿不到酬金
If they can't recognize the client, you don't get paid.

668
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:29,400
因為你可以隨便找個替死鬼來交差
You could take out anybody and said you did the job.

669
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,130
- 明白了嗎？ - 明白了，別射臉
- Got it? - Got it. Never in the face.

670
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:35,710
- 現在你可以把槍收起來 - 你們在幹什麼？
- Now you can put the tools away. - What are you fucking doing?

671
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,440
這到底是怎麼回事？ 嘿，先生！
What the fuck is going on? Hey, mister!

672
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,680
你們…
What are you fucking--

673
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:46,380
如果經常用消音器的話…
You see, when you use the silencer a lot...

674
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,720
你要在這堜騅竷活K
you have to put a piece of cloth here...

675
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:51,690
因為發熱會使堶捫N起來
because it gets very hot and could burn it inside.

676
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,490
最好是塊濕布，黑色的布
A damp, black cloth is the best.

677
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,760
你在做什麼？
What you doing?

678
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,060
我們說過，不殺女人和小孩
We said no women, no kids.

679
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,830
你以為這些東西會害死誰 那些癮君子嗎？
Who do you think this is gonna kill, junkies and monkeys?

680
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,070
毒物都清理完畢了
Now it's clean.

681
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:28,590
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

682
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,330
我還以為我們不應該喝酒
I thought we don't have the right to drink.

683
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:48,900
我知道，但今天例外 為了慶祝你的首次出擊
I know, but we're making an exception for your first time.

684
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:55,650
既然我們是在慶祝 出色地完成任務…
Well, if we're making exceptions for a job well-done...

685
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:59,560
那就吻我一下 就像電影堥獐芊A如何？
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

686
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,160
好吧
Yes.

687
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,310
你想幹什麼？
What you doing?

688
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,860
- 我要吻你 - 快停止，拜托
- I'm going to kiss you. - I want you to stop, please.

689
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,370
來吧，只是吻一下而已
Come on. Just a kiss.

690
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,810
停下，別人都在看著我們
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

691
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:22,030
回去坐下
Go sit down.

692
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,790
好好享受
Enjoy.

693
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,260
- 你不相信我，是嗎？ - 這話怎麼說？
- You don't believe me, do you? - How's that?

694
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:44,340
- 我說我愛上你的時候 - 瑪蒂達，請別再說了
- When I say I'm in love with you. - Mathilda, please drop it.

695
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:48,200
- 換個話題，好嗎？ - 好吧，對不起
- Just change the subject, okay? - Okay. Sorry.

696
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,550
那麼，你第一次殺人時幾歲？
So, how old were you when you made your first hit?

697
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,220
19歲
Nineteen.

698
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,220
那我贏你了
Beat you.

699
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:07,120
- 你在幹什麼？ - 我可不能感冒
- What you doing? - Can't afford to catch a cold.

700
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:57,670
- 沒有門鈴 - 那就敲門吧
- There's no doorbell. - So knock on the door.

701
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,350
- 誰？ - 嗨
- Yes? - Hi.

702
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,110
我在找瑞本先生的房間…
I'm looking for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

703
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:10,550
但走廊一片漆黑，我迷路了
but it's all dark out here in the hall, and I'm lost.

704
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,580
等一下
Just a second.

705
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,030
還要嗎？來啊，露出臉來啊！
You want more? Come on. Show your fucking face.

706
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,900
你以為那麼容易就能殺了我嗎？
You think you're going to get me that easily?

707
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,120
碰到這麼難纏的目標 你就知道任務很棘手
When it's tough like this, you know it's gonna be ugly.

708
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:43,250
最好盡快搞定它 否則我們會聽他嘮叨一整天
Better make it quick or else we'll be all day listening to his crap.

709
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,820
混蛋！來啊，露出臉來啊！
Asshole! Come on, show me your fucking face, faggot!

710
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,190
- 來啊，口香糖的小把戲 - 嘿
- Come on, gum trick. - Hey.

711
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,820
那麼拉環的把戲呢？你聽說過嗎？
What about the ring trick? You know that one?

712
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,360
拉環的把戲？ 來啊，混蛋，我等著呢
Ring trick? Come on, asshole. I'm waiting.

713
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,360
讓我瞧瞧啊，你他媽的
Show it to me, motherfucker.

714
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,310
這就是拉環的把戲
That's the ring trick.

715
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:26,250
馬媔齱A回理發店去 晚點再理發
Mario, go back to the barbershop. We'll finish later.

716
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,670
堜龤A怎麼樣？都辦妥了嗎？
Leon, what's up? All done already?

717
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,550
豬比人還要好，對吧？
Nicer than people, eh?

718
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,550
是我告訴你的
I told you that.

719
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,720
- 你遇到麻煩了嗎？ - 沒有
You got a problem?

720
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:57,560
拿把椅子坐下
Get the chair. Sit down.

721
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:06,730
我在想…
I was thinking.

722
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:13,370
如果我哪天出事了…
If something happens to me someday--

723
01:24:13,410 --> 01:24:16,970
嘿，堜龤A你不會出事的
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.

724
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:20,300
你是所向無敵的 你與子彈共舞
You're indestructible. Bullets slide off you. You play with 'em.

725
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:24,210
湯尼，我想過錢的事
Tony, I thought about my money.

726
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,710
你記得那天來過的女孩子嗎？
You remember the girl who came here the other day?

727
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:42,340
她名叫瑪蒂達
Her name is Mathilda.

728
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,700
如果我出事…
If anything happens to me...

729
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,940
我要你…
I'd like you...

730
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,910
把我的錢…
to give her...

731
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,240
都給她
my money.

732
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,180
你可以信賴我，堜
You can count on me, Leon.

733
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,690
謝謝你，湯尼
Thank you, Tony.

734
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,960
我不會太久
I won't be long.

735
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,370
- 我做錯什麼事了嗎？ - 沒有
- Did I do something wrong? - No.

736
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,440
這一票太大了
This one is too big.

737
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:23,580
我只配幹些「雜活」，對嗎？
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers, is that it?

738
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:28,150
瑪蒂達，自從我遇見你之後…
Mathilda, since I met you...

739
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,980
一切都跟以前不同了
everything's been different.

740
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:34,620
所以我只需要一些時間獨處
So I just need some time alone.

741
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,400
你也需要一些時間成長
You need some time to grow up a little.

742
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,160
我結束成長了，堜
I finished growing up, Leon.

743
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:44,060
現在只是變老
I just get older.

744
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:47,640
對我而言，剛好相反 我年紀夠大了
For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough.

745
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,340
我需要時間成長
I need time to grow up.

746
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,460
媽的
Shit.

747
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:25,930
快點！傳球！
Come on! Hustle!

748
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,830
- 好球 - 來吧
- Good shot. - Come on.

749
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:35,740
你是新來的，不是嗎？ 住在五樓，對嗎？
You're new, aren't you? Fifth floor, right?

750
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,750
- 你不能就那樣坐在這 - 真的嗎，為什麼？
- You can't sit here like that. - Really, why not?

751
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,250
沒有東西是免費的 就像停車計時器
Nothing's free. Like a parking meter.

752
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:44,320
當你停車時就要付錢 這是規矩
When you stop, you pay. It's the law.

753
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,520
- 只在電視上見過 - 你說什麼？
- Only on T.V. - What'd you say?

754
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,160
- 算了，要給多少錢？ - 十元…
- Forget it. How much is your meter? - Ten dollars...

755
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:51,890
每個月
a month.

756
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:56,030
有錢找嗎？
Got change?

757
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,830
別擔心，我可以先付一年的錢
Don't worry about it. We'll do ten for twelve.

758
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,130
我先付今年剩下的，好嗎？
I'll pay now for the rest of the year.

759
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,740
好吧，一年
Okay, a year.

760
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,600
我付了錢還要容忍你們嗎？
Does paying rent here mean I have to put up with you guys?

761
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:10,300
不
No.

762
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,280
那就到別的地方去玩
So go play somewhere else.

763
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,050
我要思考
I need to think.

764
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,140
起來，你不喜歡你的工作嗎？
Stand up. Don't you like your job?

765
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:30,630
食物
Food.

766
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:38,860
- 你要去哪堙H - 送外賣，4602室
- Where you going? - Special delivery, room 4602.

767
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,600
在這媄戚茼W
Sign here.

768
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:42,210
到這堥
Come here.

769
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,900
- 周末愉快，女孩們 - 謝謝
- Have a nice weekend, girls. - Thanks.

770
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,250
我要去洗手間
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

771
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:13,240
外賣？
Special delivery?

772
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,290
讓我猜猜看
Let me guess.

773
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,670
中國菜？
Chinese?

774
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,800
也許是泰國菜？
Thai, maybe?

775
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:29,280
我知道了
I've got it.

776
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,610
意大利菜
Italian food.

777
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:50,440
你叫什麼名字，小天使？
What's your name, angel?

778
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,170
瑪蒂達
Mathilda

779
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,170
瑪蒂達
Mathilda

780
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,360
把袋子放在地上
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

781
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,240
很好
Good.

782
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,910
告訴我你所知道的 有關意大利菜的事
Now I want you to tell me everything you know about Italian food.

783
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,190
別忘了提廚師的名字
Don't forget the name of the chef who fixed it for me.

784
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,910
沒人派我來的，我為我自己工作
Nobody sent me. I do business for myself.

785
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,990
那麼就是…
So this is something...

786
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,330
私人恩怨，是嗎？
personal, is it?

787
01:32:58,590 --> 01:33:02,660
我這次又幹了什麼壞事？
What filthy piece of shit...

788
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,740
你殺了我弟弟
did I do now? You killed my brother.

789
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:13,620
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

790
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,620
你想去陪他？
And you wanna join him?

791
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,620
不
No.

792
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:32,300
總是這樣
It's always the same thing.

793
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,580
當你開始真正恐懼死亡的時候…
It's when you start to become really afraid of death...

794
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,460
你才會懂得珍惜生命
that you learn to appreciate life.

795
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:49,960
你喜愛生命嗎，甜心？
Do you like life, sweetheart?

796
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,780
是的
Yes.

797
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,520
很好
That's good.

798
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,870
因為我不喜歡…
Because I take no pleasure...

799
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,640
去殺一個…
in taking a life...

800
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:16,610
不在乎生命的人
if it's from a person who doesn't care about it.

801
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,030
史丹
Stan.

802
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,970
史丹，我到處在找你
Stan, I've been looking all over for you.

803
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,490
- 我樓上樓下都找遍了… - 什麼事？我在忙
- I checked upstairs-- - What? I'm busy.

804
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:36,170
是麥基，他死了
It's Malky, man. He's dead.

805
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:41,600
麥基代表我們向中國佬買貨
Malky was making a buy for us from the Chinaman.

806
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:44,270
但他們與此事無關
But they got nothing to do with it.

807
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:50,210
他們說這家夥從外面闖進來 他是個行家
They told me this guy came from the outside. He was a pro.

808
01:34:50,380 --> 01:34:53,640
身手敏捷，神出鬼沒
He was fast. He fucking came out of nowhere.

809
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,610
兩秒鍾就幹掉了那些中國佬
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead in two seconds.

810
01:34:56,730 --> 01:35:00,320
別緊張，老兄，我是條子
Easy, man. I'm a cop.

811
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,030
然後他轉過身，對麥基說…
Then turns around, says something to Malky like--

812
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,260
不殺女人，不殺小孩
No women, no kids.

813
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:16,100
我認為這是私人恩怨
I think it was something personal.

814
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:22,740
今天死神反覆無常
Death is whimsical today.

815
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:53,740
老布，你聽到嗎？
Blood, do you hear me?

816
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:58,010
我聽到了，史丹 冷靜點，老兄
Yeah, I hear you, Stan. Just chill out, man.

817
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:00,550
帶她去我的辦公室，好嗎？
Would you take her up to my office?

818
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,810
好的
All right.

819
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:14,290
天殺的
Jesus fucking Christ.

820
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,110
 「堜龤A我的愛人」
Leon, my love.

821
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:30,580
「我知道殺死我弟弟的人在哪堙v
I know where to find the guys who killed my brother.

822
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:35,310
「他們的頭目名叫諾曼·史丹菲爾德 他在緝毒署，4602室」
Their boss is Norman Stansfield. He's in the D.E.A. building, room 4602.

823
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,390
「我要親手幹掉他們」
I'm gonna do them myself.

824
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,530
「如果我出事的話，桌上有兩萬元」
If something goes wrong, I left you 20 grand on the table.

825
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:45,300
「那是給你的報酬 殺一個人五千，對嗎？」
It's for a contract. Five grand ahead, right?

826
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:49,270
「親自解決這件事 我心媟|舒服一些」
I know I'll feel better after I do this.

827
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,670
「我愛你，瑪蒂達上」
I love you.

828
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:58,170
等我，不會很久
Wait. I won't be long.

829
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:01,510
我不能在聯邦大樓前停車！
I can't park in front like this. It's a federal building!

830
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,720
他會照我說的話去做
He's gonna do the same exact thing that I said.

831
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,110
 九厘米手槍
A nine millie.

832
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:14,320
子彈
Bullets.

833
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,830
又一把九厘米手槍
Another nine millie.

834
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:21,270
你打算用這些槍幹嘛？
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?

835
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:24,340
也許她打算轟掉整棟大樓
Maybe she was planning on taking out the whole building.

836
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,340
天啊！
Holy shit!

837
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,840
這是什麼？午餐
What's this? Lunch.

838
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:37,040
小心，老布，可能有毒
Careful, Blood, might be poisoned.

839
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,120
不會吧，堶惜S沒有鯷魚
There's no anchovies on this.

840
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,330
你這叫「不會很久」？ 我已經繞了至少十分鍾
Is that what you call I won't be long? I been here for ten minutes.

841
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:03,240
我已經盡快了，開車吧
I did my best.

842
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:51,990
你喜歡嗎？
Do you like it?

843
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:55,020
是的
Yes.

844
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,660
那就說吧
So say it.

845
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:01,630
我喜歡
I like it.

846
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:18,150
你不渴嗎？
Not thirsty?

847
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,330
你知道，一個女孩的第一次 是很重要的
You know, a girl's first time is very important.

848
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,490
會決定她以後的性生活
It determines the rest of her life sexually.

849
01:39:33,670 --> 01:39:36,690
我在我姐姐的雜志上看到的
I read that once in one of my sister's magazines.

850
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:40,410
我的朋友們說 她們討厭第一次的經驗
My girlfriends told me they hated their first experience.

851
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:44,840
那是因為她們不喜歡做愛的對象
That's because they didn't love the guys.

852
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:48,280
她們那麼做，只是為了炫耀
They just did it to show off.

853
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:52,150
後來，她們開始喜歡做愛了 就像抽煙一樣
Afterwards, they started liking it, like cigarettes.

854
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:59,350
我會第一次就喜歡上做愛嗎？
Will I like it the first time?

855
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:04,960
瑪蒂達，不行
Mathilda, no.

856
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,940
為什麼？
Why not?

857
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,530
我不能這麼做
I just can't.

858
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,070
- 你愛著別人？ - 沒有
- You love someone else? - No.

859
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:17,840
我的意思是…
I mean--

860
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:24,040
很久以前，我愛過一個人
There was someone a long time ago.

861
01:40:25,390 --> 01:40:27,620
在我來美國之前
Before I came to the States.

862
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:31,390
她父親不准她見我
Her father didn't want her to see me.

863
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:35,660
她出身高貴的家庭
She was from a very respectable family.

864
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,400
而我…
Mine was...

865
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:41,030
你知道…
you know...

866
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,430
出身貧寒
not so respectable.

867
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:48,620
每次她來見我，她爸爸就會發怒
Her dad went nuts every time she'd take off to see me.

868
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,070
她仍然偷偷來見你，對嗎？
She still snuck off to see you, right?

869
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:53,880
對
Right.

870
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:56,350
看，愛情是無法阻擋的，堜
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

871
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,820
他殺了她
He killed her.

872
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,650
一槍擊中她頭部
One shot through the head.

873
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:11,390
他在監獄堳搕F兩天 就被放了出來
They kept him in jail for two days, and they let him go free.

874
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,490
他們說這是場意外
They said it was an accident.

875
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,170
所以…
So...

876
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,000
一天晚上，我…
one night I...

877
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:25,350
等著他
waited for him.

878
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,380
帶著來福槍，有五百英尺遠
Five hundred feet with a lens.

879
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:33,750
他也遇上了「意外」
He also had an accident.

880
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,720
那天晚上我坐上船，來了這堙K
The same night I took a boat and came here...

881
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:42,920
和我爸爸碰面 他那時在幫湯尼做事
to meet up with my father who was working for Tony.

882
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:45,700
那年我只有19歲
I was 19.

883
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:52,970
從那以後，我就沒離開過這城市…
Since then I've never left the city, and...

884
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,940
而且我再也沒有交過女朋友
I've never had another girlfriend.

885
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,610
你明白，瑪蒂達…
You see, Mathilda...

886
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:06,760
我不會是個好情人的
I wouldn't be a good lover.

887
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:10,820
好吧
Okay.

888
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,120
你能幫我做件事嗎？
Would you do me one favor?

889
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:17,730
什麼事？
What?

890
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:20,200
我討厭看你睡在椅子上
I'm sick of watching you sleep on your chair.

891
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:22,430
我們一起睡在床上吧
We're gonna share the bed.

892
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,700
我不認為這是個好主意
I don't think it's a good idea.

893
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:29,010
沒事的
It's okay.

894
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:31,440
把腿放在床上
Put your legs up on the bed.

895
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,550
很好
Yeah. That's nice.

896
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:40,350
把頭放低點，沒事的，放輕松
Put your head down. It's okay. Relax.

897
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,140
晚安，堜
Good night, Leon.

898
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,810
晚安
Good night.

899
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,570
先給我一塊蛋糕！
I want a piece of cake first!

900
01:43:38,650 --> 01:43:42,780
馬諾洛，帶孩子們去廚房
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

901
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:05,170
我一直很尊重你的生意，湯尼
I have a lot of respect for your business, Tony.

902
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:07,800
你以前為我們殺人…
When you've killed for us in the past...

903
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:11,390
我們一向都很滿意
we've always been satisfied.

904
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:17,060
所以今天我很難啟齒
That's exactly why today is going to be very hard for me.

905
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:19,100
希望你能諒解我的心情
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

906
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:27,270
我的手下在你的地盤上被殺
My man was killed right here on your turf.

907
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,490
中國佬說，那個殺手…
The Chinks tell me that the hit man...

908
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:34,320
像是意大利人
was kind of the Italian type.

909
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:38,280
所以我們想，湯尼可能知道些什麼
So we figured that Tony might know something.

910
01:44:38,370 --> 01:44:40,860
等等，還有件事…
Wait. There's more.

911
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:43,340
你會喜歡這個的
You're gonna love this.

912
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:50,710
幾個小時後，一個12歲的小女孩 走進我的辦公室…
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office...

913
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:55,550
她全副武裝，想置我於死地
armed to the teeth, with the firm intention of sending me to the morgue.

914
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:59,940
你知道是誰來把她救走的嗎？
Do you know who came and got her right there in my building?

915
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,850
正是同一個…
The very same...

916
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:05,320
意大利殺手
Italian hit man.

917
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:12,360
我真想和他見見面
I'm dying to meet him.

918
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:21,110
放輕松點，一切都很好 睡得好嗎？
Relax. Everything's fine. Sleep well?

919
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:25,410
我從沒真正睡著 總會睜著一只眼睛
I never really sleep. Got one eye open always.

920
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:27,450
是啊，我忘了
Yeah, I forgot.

921
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:30,910
我從沒見過 有人睜著一只眼還會打鼾
I never saw someone with one eye open snore so much.

922
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:34,760
- 我打鼾嗎？ - 就像個嬰兒
- I snore? - Like a baby.

923
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:39,550
我去買些牛奶回來做早餐 很快就回來
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast. I won't be long.

924
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:41,550
回來時別忘了敲暗號
Don't forget the code when you come back.

925
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:44,090
敲兩下，然後一下，再兩下，對嗎？
Two knocks, then one, and two knocks again. Right?

926
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:45,630
對
Right.

927
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:08,790
I'm gonna go get some milk.
Hola se駉r! Ring these up. 你好，先生，等一下 我去拿些牛奶

928
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:31,050
從現在起，不准出聲
From here on out, you don't make a sound.

929
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:35,060
用點頭或搖頭來回答我的問題 明白了嗎？
You answer my questions by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

930
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:37,690
他是獨自一人嗎？
Is he alone?

931
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,950
他在等你回去？
Does he expect you?

932
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:43,190
你有房間鑰匙嗎？
Do you have keys to the apartment?

933
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,560
有沒有敲門的暗號？
Is there a code, a way of knocking, so he knows it's you?

934
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,020
阿爾發小組
Alpha team.

935
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:39,710
- 最後位置，准備行動 - 小心點
- Final position. We're ready to go. - Be careful.

936
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:29,930
怎麼了？走開！媽的
What up? Move! Fuck.

937
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:37,140
糟了
Shit.

938
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,920
阿爾發小組，有人倒地
Alpha team. Man down.

939
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:43,880
我警告過了
I told you.

940
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,380
巴利
Benny.

941
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:50,800
 - 把所有的人都叫來 - 「所有的人」是指什麼？
- Bring me everyone.- What do you mean, everyone?

942
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:53,090
所有的人！
Everyone!

943
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:48,820
拿著
Take this.

944
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,750
去看看
Go take a look.

945
01:50:11,910 --> 01:50:15,470
- 別動 - 你看到什麼嗎？
- Don't move. - Do you see anything?

946
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:20,980
是那家夥，他在這 他正用槍抵著我的頭
It's the guy. He's here. He's got a gun to my head.

947
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:25,820
好，大家別輕舉妄動
Nobody moves.

948
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,220
- 把女孩放了 - 冷靜點，老兄！
- Let the girl go. - Take it easy, man!

949
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:31,080
把女孩放了
Let the girl go.

950
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:35,230
好，女孩出來了 放了那女孩
Okay, the girl's coming out. Let the girl go.

951
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,840
把牆上的斧頭拿下來 就在那堙A快去！
Grab the axe off the wall. Over there. Go!

952
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,250
你跟我們一起走
You're coming with us.

953
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,260
天啊，他開槍殺了他！
Christ, he shot him!

954
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,070
雜種！
Bastard!

955
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,710
快走！快走！
Move!

956
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:28,090
- 把水龍頭關掉 - 知道了
- Shut the fucking water off! - Got it.

957
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:30,230
快走
Come!

958
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:35,080
我們情況很不妙，派特勤隊來 重覆，派特勤隊來
We're in a bad way here. Send the cats.

959
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,830
我不知道發生什麼事 我沒看見他們出現，我發誓！
I don't know what happened. I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

960
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:54,500
我買完東西回來 就到處都是他們的人
I just went shopping and I came back, and they were everywhere.

961
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:58,240
離窗口遠點
Stay away from the window.

962
01:52:26,410 --> 01:52:27,840
堜龤H
Leon?

963
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:30,040
堜龤H
Leon?

964
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:46,060
來這
Come here.

965
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:50,160
有狙擊手
Snipers.

966
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,100
好，現在把那個混蛋趕出來
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole out of there.

967
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,890
- 我們現在要如何逃走？ - 交給我，我們馬上走
- How are we gonna get outta here now? - Leave it to me. We're checking out.

968
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:22,020
但是，堜龤A這洞口你過不去 我才剛好可擠過去
But it's not big enough for you. It's barely big enough for me.

969
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:25,490
- 我們說過不准討價還價 - 不，我不要…
- We said no discussion. - No, I'm not letting--

970
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:32,170
- 我不走！我不走！ - 聽我說…
- I'm not going! I won't go! - Listen to me.

971
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,700
我們在一起就沒機會 但如果我一個人，就可以辦到
We have no chance together. But if I'm alone, I can do it.

972
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:37,000
相信我，我情況很好，瑪蒂達
Trust me. I'm in good shape.

973
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,570
我在湯尼那埵釩雃h錢
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

974
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,510
我們會拿到錢一起離開 只有我們兩個，好嗎？
We'll take it and leave together, just the two of us.

975
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:43,880
走吧
Go.

976
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:47,410
不，你這樣說是為了讓我安心
You're saying that so I won't worry.

977
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:54,820
- 我不想失去你，堜 - 你不會失去我的，瑪蒂達
- I don't wanna lose you. - You're not gonna lose me.

978
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:56,590
你讓我嘗到了人生的樂趣
You've given me a taste for life.

979
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,130
我想要快樂，睡在床上 有自己的根
I wanna be happy, sleep in a bed, have roots.

980
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,220
你永遠不會再孤獨了，瑪蒂達
You'll never be alone again.

981
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:08,770
拜托，快走，寶貝，快走
Please, go now, baby. Go.

982
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:13,710
冷靜點，快走，走
Calm down. Go now. Go.

983
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:20,280
在湯尼那堥ㄜ情A我會解決他們的 一小時後湯尼那堥
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

984
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,890
我愛你，瑪蒂達
I love you, Mathilda.

985
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:30,030
我也愛你，堜
I love you, too, Leon.

986
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:10,770
嘿，上面怎麼回事？ 我說幹掉他，不是炸掉整棟大樓
Hey, what is going on up there? Take the guy out, not the building.

987
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:33,280
這埵陪茪H活著！
We've got one breathing here!

988
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:37,020
叫醫護人員來！
Get a medic on the horn!

989
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,900
讓路！讓他過去！
Clear the hall! Let him through!

990
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:49,540
- 有人受傷了，讓路！ - 走樓梯
- We've got a wounded man. Make way! - Down those stairs.

991
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,170
走吧！快！
Let's go! Move!

992
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:56,080
把他帶下樓梯！
Get that guy off the stairs!

993
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:59,620
帶你那一隊回到原位！
- Get your team back out there! - I got him!

994
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:02,720
有兩個人走樓梯下來了
We've got two men coming down the stairs. Let's hurry!

995
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:28,710
你沒事吧？ 嘿，這婸搨n醫護人員！
You okay? Hey, I need a medic over here!

996
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,520
讓開
Move your fucking asses.

997
01:57:30,580 --> 01:57:33,130
第一組，公寓堭〞p如何？
Squad Number One, what's the status on the apartment?

998
01:57:33,190 --> 01:57:35,710
什麼都看不見 煙太濃了，給我們五分鍾
Can't see shit. Too much smoke. Give us five minutes.

999
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:37,120
好吧
You got it.

1000
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:40,760
什麼？兩百人也找不到 一個男人和一個女孩嗎？
What? Two hundred men can't find one man and a girl?

1001
01:57:40,850 --> 01:57:42,230
你找到那女孩了嗎？
Did you find the girl?

1002
01:57:51,610 --> 01:57:54,500
你感覺如何？快把面罩拿下
How are you doing? Take your mask off, quick.

1003
01:57:57,110 --> 01:58:01,100
讓我看看，傷口很深 這堛熄豸f…
Let me see you. That's deep. Right. And this one here--

1004
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:04,440
你是第三分局的嗎？
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

1005
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:10,080
好，把袖子拉開
Let's open up his sleeve a little bit.

1006
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:16,450
好了，沒事的，把手放下
All right, fine. Put it down. This one.

1007
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:35,350
你在這媯巨滮擱 我馬上就回來
You stay there for two minutes. I'll be right back.

1008
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,920
讓我戴上面罩 這樣比較容易呼吸
Let me put the mask back on. I breathe better with it.

1009
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:42,920
好，你說得對，坐在這塈O動
You're all right. Sit tight.

1010
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:54,170
好，所有人都出去！ 快點，我們走！快點，出去！
Come on, everybody out! Let's go! Out!

1011
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:21,720
讓路
Clear the way, men.

1012
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:33,170
你在這媟F什麼？ 快走開
What are you doing here? Get out. Come on.

1013
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:26,520
史丹菲爾德？
Stansfield?

1014
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,880
正是
At your service.

1015
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:41,370
這是…
This is from...

1016
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:49,700
瑪蒂達送給你的
Mathilda.

1017
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:07,120
媽的
Shit.

1018
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,580
快離開這堙I
Get out of here!

1019
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:35,750
堜靋n求我幫助你…
Leon asked me to help you out...

1020
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,930
如果他出事的話 我想他出事了
if something happened, and I think something happened.

1021
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:43,740
他留下一筆錢給你
He put aside a little cash for you.

1022
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,990
我的建議是…
So what I'm suggesting is that...

1023
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:49,540
由於你還太年輕…
seeing as how you're still so young...

1024
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:52,500
錢就由我保管，直到你長大為止
I should hold the money for you until you're older.

1025
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:54,660
就像銀行，你知道的，除了…
Like a bank, you know, except...

1026
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:58,740
比銀行更好 因為銀行會被打劫
it's better than a bank 'cause banks always get knocked off.

1027
02:02:58,910 --> 02:03:01,510
但沒人敢打劫老湯尼
No one knocks off old Tony.

1028
02:03:01,680 --> 02:03:04,240
但這是你的錢，在這期間…
But it's your money. In the meantime...

1029
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:08,250
你只須偶爾來一趟…
all you gotta do is come here every once in awhile...

1030
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:12,090
我會給你一點錢，讓你玩樂一下
and I'll dish it out so you can have a little fun.

1031
02:03:13,330 --> 02:03:14,660
拿去
Here.

1032
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:20,390
- 先給你一百塊 - 不能給我一個工作嗎？
- Here's a hundred bucks to start. - Can't I get a job instead?

1033
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:25,390
工作？你能做什麼？
A job? What the hell can you do?

1034
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:27,440
我會做「清潔工作」
I can clean.

1035
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:31,380
我沒有工作給十二歲的小孩做…
I ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid...

1036
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:33,310
別再有這種荒唐的想法了！
so get it out of your goddamn head!

1037
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:36,180
結束了！遊戲結束了！
It's over! The game's over!

1038
02:03:36,220 --> 02:03:38,750
堜蠾漱F！
Leon's dead!

1039
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:40,750
你聽到了嗎？
You hear me?

1040
02:03:48,260 --> 02:03:52,690
拜托，你以為我不傷心嗎？
Come on. You think I ain't hurting too?

1041
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,600
但他已經死了
But he's dead.

1042
02:04:00,780 --> 02:04:05,940
你應該忘掉這一切，回學校去 明白嗎？
You're gonna forget all this craziness and get your little ass back to school.

1043
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:09,170
現在拿著錢，離開這
Now take this money and get the hell outta here.

1044
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:11,340
下個月前別再讓我看到你…
Don't let me see your face till next month...

1045
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:15,480
因為我快失去耐性了
'cause something tells me I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1046
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:10,210
我的父母…
My parents...

1047
02:05:10,380 --> 02:05:12,370
都死了…
died...

1048
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:17,040
四周前死於一場車禍
in a car accident four weeks ago.

1049
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:19,050
太可怕了
It was terrible.

1050
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:25,540
你剛來的時候 我們沒時間互相了解…
We didn't have the time to get to know one another when you first came here...

1051
02:05:25,550 --> 02:05:30,490
但我要你明白 我不是會讓孩子失望的女人…
but I want you to know I'm not the kind of woman who'd let down a child...

1052
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:33,600
無論她處境如何 無論她犯了什麼錯
whatever her situation, whatever her mistake.

1053
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:39,230
所以我會盡力幫助你 歡迎你回來
So I'm going to help you and do my best to welcome you here again.

1054
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:43,300
但有個條件…
But on one condition:

1055
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:46,570
你必須停止對我說謊，瑪蒂達
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1056
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:48,810
我要你試著…
I want you to take a chance...

1057
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,820
信任我
and trust me.

1058
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:54,390
告訴我，你究竟發生了什麼事
Tell me what happened to you.

1059
02:05:55,650 --> 02:05:56,700
好吧
Okay.

1060
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:01,040
我的家人因為毒品問題…
My family got shot down by D.E.A. officers...

1061
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:04,500
被緝毒署的人殺了
because of a drug problem.

1062
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:07,210
我和世上最棒的男人一起離開
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1063
02:06:07,250 --> 02:06:12,050
他是城堻抭誚y的殺手 但他今天早上死了
He was a hit man, the best in town, but he died this morning.

1064
02:06:12,090 --> 02:06:15,970
你不幫我的話 今晚我也會死的
