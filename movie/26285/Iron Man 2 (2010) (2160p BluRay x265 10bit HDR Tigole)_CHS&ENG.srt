1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,670
我有一阵子没开记者会了
Been a while since I was up here in front of you.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,840
我猜我只好照着提词卡念吧
Maybe I'll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,600
有传闻说我涉及了一些事件
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,100
发生在公路和屋顶发生的事…
on the freeway and the rooftop...

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,230
抱歉 你真的以为我们会相信
Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that

6
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,900
一名穿着钢铁盔甲的保镖刚好出现
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,690
况且你平常很讨厌带保镖
despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,900
对
Yes.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,660
而且这名神秘保镖居然配有…
And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,160
斯塔克工业最先进的高机密武器
with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle...

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,770
（莫斯科）

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,200
我知道这令人费解
I know that it's confusing.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,830
但质疑官方说法是一回事 而另一回事
It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,130
又是胡乱地谴责 瞎猜我是超级英雄…
to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,430
老实说 我不是当英雄的料
I mean, let's face it, I'm not the heroic type.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,720
我的人格有很多缺陷
A laundry list of character defects,

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,640
而且也公开做过许多蠢事
all the mistakes I've made, largely public.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,350
事实是…
The truth is

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,270
我就是钢铁侠
I am Iron Man.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,240
伊万…
Ivan.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,970
万尼亚
Vanya.

22
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,260
那应该是你

23
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,180
别听他们胡说八道

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,690
对不起

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,650
我只能给你我的知识

“时代杂志年度风云人物”

33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,510

35
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,080
你现在可以进入降落区
You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone.

36
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,890
（6个月后）

37
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,190
（斯塔克博览会 纽约法拉盛）

38
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,130
托尼！托尼！托尼！托尼！
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

39
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,550
回来真好！
It's good to be back.

40
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,220
-你们很想我？ -炸掉什么吧！
-You missed me? -Blow something up!

41
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,480
我也想你们 炸掉什么？我干过了呀！
I missed you, too. Blow something up? I already did that.

42
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,810
我没有说全球沉浸于…
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

43
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,070
多年长期持续的和平状态是因为我
its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.

44
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,780
我也没说世上没人像我一样
I'm not saying that from the ashes of captivity,

45
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,910
如同浴火凤凰般重获新生
never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history.

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,920
我更没说过“山姆大叔”能舒服地躺在椅子上
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair,

47
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,630
悠闲地喝着冰茶
sipping on an iced tea

48
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,760
因为我始终保持巅峰状态
because I haven't come across anyone who's man enough

49
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,720
没人敢跟我单挑！
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

50
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,350
我爱你 钢铁侠！
I love you, Tony!

51
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,560
拜托 我不重要
Please, it's not about me.

52
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,730
你们也不重要
It's not about you.

53
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,990
我们都不重要 重要的是传承
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

54
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,830
我们该替未来世代留下什么
It's about what we choose to leave behind for future generations.

60
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,140
我们并不重要
It's not about us.

61
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,180
因此 我想说的是
Therefore, what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything,

101
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,550
我来开车 行吗？ 你打哪来的？
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?

102
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,880
-贝德福 -你来这里干嘛？

105

他特别喜欢警徽
He likes the badge.

112
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,070
-你还是喜欢吗？  -对

-How far are we from D.C.? -D.C.? 250 miles.

114
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,410


115
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,610
（华盛顿）

116
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,210
斯塔克先生 我们继续刚才的议题好吗？斯塔克先生 拜托
Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

117
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,880
-是的 亲爱的？ -能专心听我的话吗？
-Yes, dear? -Can I have your attention?

118
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,050
没问题
Absolutely.

119
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,090
你是否拥有一种特殊武器？
Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?

120
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,470
-我没有 我没有 -你没有？
-I do not. I do not. -You do not?

121
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,050
这要看你认为什么才算武器
Well, it depends on how you define the word "weapon."

122
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,810
-钢铁侠就算武器 -我的发明并不算武器
-The Iron Man weapon. -My device does not fit that description.

123
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,600
那你会怎么形容它？
Well... How would you describe it?

124
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,730
它是什么就是什么 参议员
I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.

125
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,610
-它是什么？ -它是一种高科技的假肢
-As? -It's a high-tech prosthesis.

126
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,730
那是…那是…我那是想得到最好的形容词
That is... That is...That's actually the most apt description Ican make of it.

127
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,070
它是一种武器 它是武器
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr Stark.

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,240
如果你是以人民福祉为优先…
Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...

129
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,200
不 我是以把钢铁侠这项武器
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people

130
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,660
-交给美国人民为优先 -想都别想
-of the United States of America. -Well, you can forget it.

131
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,000
我就是钢铁侠 我和钢铁盔甲合为一体
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

132
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,550
交出钢铁侠就是交出我自己
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,

133
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,630
那算是劳役或是卖淫…
which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution,

134
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,380
要看你是在哪一州
depending on what state you're in.

135
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,430
-我不能给你 -听好 我不是专家…
-You can't have it. -Look, I'm no expert...

136
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,310
卖淫专家？当然不是 你是参议员 好吧
ln prostitution? Of course not. You're a senator. Come on.

137
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,730
我并不是武器专家
I'm no expert in weapons.

138
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,650
但是我们请来一位武器专家
We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.

139
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,490
我要传唤贾斯汀・汉默 国防部目前主要的军火商
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.

140
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,990
请记录我看见汉默先生走进来
Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber,

141
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,410
并且我想
and I am wondering

142
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,290
但我并没看见任何武器专家
if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.

143
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,500
没错 我并不是专家 你才是 托尼
Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer to you, Anthony.

144
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,590
你才是个天才
You're the wonder boy.

145
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,800
参议员 请容我发言
Senator, if I may.

146
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,350
或许我并不是专家 但你知道谁才是真的专家？
I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?

147
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,060
你父亲！霍华德・斯塔克
Your dad. Howard Stark.

148
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,560
他不但是我们的大家长 更是军事工业之父
Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.

149
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,690
但是请搞清楚 他不是卖花儿童 他是只雄狮
Let's just be clear. He was no flower child. He was a lion.

150
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,190
我们都知道为什么来这里 这半年来
We all know why we're here. ln the last six months,

151
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,410
托尼・斯塔克打造了一把犀利宝剑
Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.

152
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,330
他却坚持那只是一面盾牌
And yet he insists it's a shield.

153
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,040
它要我们信任他 要我们躲在他后面
He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.

154
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,380
我真希望我觉得很安全 我是真的这么希望
I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do.

155
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,590
我很希望出门时不必锁门
I'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house,

156
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,130
但这里不是加拿大
but this ain't Canada.

157
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,880
我们活在充满危险的世界
You know, we live in a world of grave threats,

158
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,720
斯塔克先生不一定能预知的危险
threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee.

159
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,220
谢谢各位
Thank you.

160
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,060
天佑钢铁侠 天佑美国
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

161
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,270
说得好 汉默先生
That is well said, Mr Hammer.

162
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,310
现在我们要邀请…
The committee would now like to invite

163
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,520
詹姆斯・罗德中校出席会议
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.

164
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,110
洛德？
Rhodey? What?

165
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,700
兄弟 没想到你会来
Hey, buddy. I didn't expect to see you here.

166
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,410
是我 我来了 接受事实 继续吧
Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it. Let's move on.

167
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,580
我只是…
I just...

168
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,080
-别说了 -好吧 我不说了
-Drop it. -All right, I'll drop it.

169
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,670
这是罗德中校收集到…
I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon,

170
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,420
有关钢铁侠武器的完整报告
compiled by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record,

171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,630
中校 请你念57页第4段
can you please read page 57, paragraph four?

172
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,010
你要我念特定的段落
You're requesting that I read specific selections

173
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,390
-是报告中的 议员？ -是的
-from my report, Senator? -Yes, sir.

174
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,390
我以为我是来做…
It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying

175
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,640
完整及详细的报告
in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

176
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,350
我了解 但是今天有很多变数
l understand. A lot of things have changed today.

177
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,730
-假如你能读一下… -你懂的
-So if you could just read... -You do understand

178
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,230
光是念出那一个段落不能代表…
that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect

179
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,610
-我的完整报告…  -请你念出来 中校 我懂 谢谢
-the summary of my final... -Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

180
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,070
好吧
Very well.

181
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,280
“由于钢铁侠并不隶属政府任何单位
"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,

182
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,370
钢铁侠具有潜在的安全隐患 对于国家
"Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation

183
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,870
以及国家的利益来说”
"and to her interests."

184
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,830
但是我的结论是…
I did, however, go on to summarise

185
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,630
钢铁侠的好处远比坏处更多
that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.

186
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,880
-并且符合我们利益的是…  -够了 中校
-And that it would be in our interest... -That's enough, Colonel.

187
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,130
-让斯塔克先生… -我说够了
-...to fold Mr Stark... -That's enough.

188
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,760
…加入军事指挥体系 议员
...into the existing chain of command, Senator.

189
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,220
我不喜欢加入任何体系 但我倒是可以考虑当国防部长
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

190
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,970
我可以减少工作时数
We can amend the hours a little bit.

191
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,390
如果可能 我还想继续播放
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

192
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,650
你报告中的影像
the imagery that's connected to your report.

193
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,610
我认为目前还不是…
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images

194
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,480
-向大众公开这些影像的时候 -恕我直言
-to the general public at this time. -With all due respect,

195
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,780
我能理解 中校
Colonel, I understand.

196
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,950
但如果你能描述这些影像 我们会非常感激
And if you could just narrate those for us, we'd be very grateful.

197
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,990
把影像调出来
Let's have the images.

198
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,660
情报显示这些影像中的装置
Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos

199
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,170
其实是斯塔克先生钢铁盔甲的仿冒品
are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark's suit.

200
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,300
这一点经过我们的盟国以及地面情报单位的证实
This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,

201
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,510
这些钢铁盔甲目前很可能可以使用
indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.

202
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,600
等一下 给我看看 有东西了
Hold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.

203
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,180
我真厉害 我控制了你的屏幕
Boy, I'm good. I commandeered your screens.

204
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,690
我需要它们 该让这一切透明化了
I need them. Time for a little transparency.

205
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,690
-我们看看这到底是怎么回事 -他在做什么？
-Now, let's see what's really going on. -What is he doing?

206
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,030
请你们看电脑屏幕
If you will direct your attention to said screens...

207
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,700
我相信那是北韩
l believe that's North Korea.

208
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,790
能不能关掉？快关掉
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

209
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,040
伊朗
Iran.

210
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,550
没有紧急严重的威胁 那是贾斯汀・汉默吗？
No grave immediate threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?

211
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,090
他怎么也在搞仿冒品？
How did Hammer get in the game?

212
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,800
贾斯汀 你上电视了 焦点人物
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

213
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,390
很好 向左转 很好 向右转
Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good. Turn to the right.

214
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,520
糟了 糟了！
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

215
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,530
大部份的国家得花5到10年
Yeah, I'd say most countries, five, 10 years away.

216
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,900
汉默工业至少要花20年
Hammer Industries, 20.

217
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,620
容我指出那位驾驶员没有死
I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

218
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,240
我想我们看够了 他证明了他的看法
I think we're done, is the point that he's making.

219
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,540
-我觉得没有任何理由… -我猜我只能说：不客气
-I don't think there's any reason... -The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

220
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,460
-什么意思？ -我能防止核战的恫吓
-For what? -Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

221
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,080
钢铁侠很有用 我们很安全 美国很安全
It's working. We're safe. America is secure.

222
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,090
你要我的产品？想都别想！
You want my property? You can't have it.

223
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,590
不过我帮了你们个大忙
But I did you a big favour.

224
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,260
我一个人就能维持世界和平
I've successfully privatized world peace.

225
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,640
你还想要我怎样？现在就是这样！
What more do you want? For now!

226
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,310
我试着和那些跳梁小丑合作
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

227
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,770
…去你的 斯塔克先生
...you, Mr Stark. ...you, buddy.

228
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,980
散会 今天散会
We're adjourned. We're adjourned for today.

229
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,360
-好吧 -你真是个开心果
-Okay. -You've been a delight.

230
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,450
听好 我全是为了人民
My bond is with the people.

231
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,790
我以自己的乐趣为国家服务
And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.

232
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,460
如果我向全世界证明了什么
If there's one thing I've proven

233
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,880
那就是你们绝对能信赖我…能让自己很高兴
it's that you can count on me to pleasure myself.

234
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,610
（加州马里布）

235
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,080
醒醒吧 老爹回来了
Wake up. Daddy's home.

236
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,750
欢迎回家
Welcome home, sir.

237
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,710
恭喜博览会开幕仪式
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.

238
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,840
以及参议院听证会大大地成功
They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.

239
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,670
容我说一句
And may I say how refreshing it is

240
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,510
你穿着衣服上电视令人耳目一新
to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.

241
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,550
你！
You!

242
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,350
我发誓我会把你拆掉 我会泡烂你的主板
I swear to God I'll dismantle you. I'll soak your motherboard.

243
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,020
我会把你做成书架
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

244
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,940
这种臭东西我还要喝多少？
How many ounces a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

245
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,030
80盎斯才能消除钯中毒的征状
We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.

246
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,950
检查钯元素含量
Check palladium levels.

247
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,200
血液毒性：24%
Blood toxicity, 24%.

248
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,040
看来只要你继续使用钢铁盔甲
It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit

249
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,540
中毒的速度会愈快
is accelerating your condition.

250
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,420
另一块钯能量板又耗损光了
Another core has been depleted.

251
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,470
它们耗损得很快
God, they're running out quick.

252
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,220
我模拟过每一种已知的元素
I have run simulations on every known element,

253
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,430
没有一种能替代钯元素
and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.

254
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,730
你的时闲和选择已经不多了
You are running out of both time and options.

255
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,150
很不幸 让你活命的装置
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive

256
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,070
也会害死你
is also killing you.

257
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,990
波兹小姐来了
Miss Potts is approaching.

258
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,990
-我建议你立刻告诉… -静音
-I recommend that you inform her... -Mute.

259
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,660
你在开玩笑吗？
Is this a joke?

260
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,750
-你在想什么？ -什么？
-What are you thinking? -What?

261
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,130
-你在想什么？ -我在想我很忙
-What are you thinking? -Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

262
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,550
你又在生气
And you're angry about something.

263
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,010
你感冒了吗？我不想被传染
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.

264
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,510
-你是不是把… -继续做你的事
-Did you just donate... -Keep your business.

265
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,140
我们所有的现代艺术收藏捐给…
...our entire modern art collection to the...

266
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,850
-美国童子军协会 -美国童子军协会？
-Boy Scouts ofAmerica. -...Boy Scouts ofAmerica?

267
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,720
那是很有意义的组织
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

268
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,180
我没有亲自检查过木箱 不过基本上没错
I didn't physically check the crates but, basically, yes.

269
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,440
而且不是我们的收藏 是我的收藏 不要介意
And it's not "our" collection, it's my collection. No offence.

270
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,230
不会 你知道吗？我有权讨论“我们”的收藏
No, you know what? I think I'm actually entitled to say "our" collection

271
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,530
因为我花了十年整理
considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.

272
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,450
都是为了减税 我需要那个
It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

273
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,620
我只有8千零11件事…
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

274
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,660
必须跟你讨论
that I really need to talk to you about.

275
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,200
机械手 别恍神 专心点
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

276
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,750
布里奇伯特已经加工了部分
The Bridgeport's already machining that part.

277
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,210
博览会完全是浪费时闲
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

278
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,540
你感冒没好之前得戴口罩
I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're feeling better.

279
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,670
-好不好？ -你很没礼貌
-Is that okay? -That's rude.

280
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,250
没有什么比博览会对我更重要
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.

281
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,670
那是我最关心的事情
It's my primary point of concern.

282
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,920
-不知你为何… -博览会只是你的虚荣心作祟
-I don't know why you're... -The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

283
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,800
哇 你看看
Wow. Look at that.

284
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,390
这是现代艺术 我要挂起来
That's modern art. That's going up.

285
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,220
-你一定是在开玩笑 -我要马上把它挂起来
-You've got to be kidding. -I'm gonna put this up right now.

286
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,520
-这很重要 -斯塔克工业乱成一团
-This is vital. -Stark is in complete disarray.

287
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,940
-你明白吗？ -不对 我们的股价涨停板
-You understand that? -No. Our stocks have never been higher.

288
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,360
-那是从经营者的角度来看 -你…如果很乱
-Yes, from a managerial standpoint. -You are... Well, if it's messy,

289
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,940
-那就绕回去 -让我举例说明
-then let's double back. -Let me give you an example.

290
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,610
-再谈刚才那件事 -不 不
-Let's move on to another subject. -No, no, no, no.

291
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,400
你不准把巴奈特・纽曼的画拿下来
You are not taking down the Barnett Newman

292
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,990
-继续挂着！ -我不是拿下来
-and hanging that up! -I'm not taking it down.

293
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,320
只是取代它
I'm just replacing it with this.

294
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,780
-看看我得到了什么 -好吧 随你便
-Let's see what I can get going here. -Okay, fine.

295
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,990
我想说的是…我们拿到合约
My point is, we have already awarded contracts

296
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,750
-风力发电场的合约 -别提到风
-to the wind farm people. -Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

297
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,910
-你会害我撇风 -还有废气处理厂的合约
-I'm already feeling gassy. -And to the plastic plantation tree,

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,130
那是你的点子 这些人都领我们的薪水
which was your idea, by the way. Those people are on payroll...

299
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,000
-一切都是我的点子 -…你不会再做决定
-Everything was my idea. -...and you won't make a decision.

300
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,800
我不再关心自由派议题了
I don't care about the liberal agenda any more.

301
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,260
超无聊的！我要给你一个无聊警告
It's boring. Boring. I'm giving you a boring alert.

302
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,630
-你去做  -做什么？
-You do it. -I do what?

303
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
这点子太赞了 我刚想出来的 你来管理公司
Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.

304
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,160
是啊 我一直在试着管理公司
Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.

305
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
小辣椒 我需要你管理公司
Pepper, I need you to run the company.

306
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,060
-嗯 不是叫你试着去做而是亲自去做 -你不应该…
-Well, stop trying to do it and do it. -You will not

307
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,810
-告诉我这个消息 -我不是要你去试着做…
-give me the information... -I'm not asking you to try...

308
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,020
-…为了…  -我要求你
-...in order to... -I'm asking you

309
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,310
亲自去做 我需要你去做
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

310
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,150
-我一直试着在做呀！ -小辣椒 你没在听我说话！
-I am trying to do it. -Pepper, you're not listening to me!

311
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,150
-不 你都没在听 -我要你当首席执行官
-No, you are not listening to me. -I'm trying to make you CEO.

312
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,110
你为什么不肯？
Why won't you let me?

313
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,650
-你喝了不少吧？ -叶绿素汁
-Have you been drinking? -Chlorophyll.

314
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,830
我正式任命你为斯塔克工业首席执行官
I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

315
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,830
马上生效
effective immediately.

316
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,920
就这样
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

317
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,960
信不信由你 我想了很久
I've actually given this a fair amount of thought,

318
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,970
我甚至找了一些人选
believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

319
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,930
认真思考谁是最适合的人选
trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.

320
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,810
后来才发现…
And then I realised

321
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,890
就是你 一直都是你
it's you. It's always been you.

322
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,020
我还以为会有法律问题
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

323
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,570
不过我是可以指定我的接班人
but actually I'm capable of appointing my successor.

324
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
也就是你
My successor being you.

325
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,120
恭喜了
Congratulations?

326
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,450
-拿去 拿去嘛 -我不知道该怎么想
-Take it, just take it. -I don't know what to think.

327
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,330
别想 喝下去
Don't think. Drink.

328
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,500
就这样
There you go.

329
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,910

332
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,260
-对不起  -这是哪一招？
-Sorry. -What the hell was that?

这叫综合格斗 才刚流行了三周时间
It's called mixed martial arts. It's been around for three weeks.

这叫下流拳击 流行很久了
It's called dirty boxing. There's nothing new about it.

335
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,480
好吧 来吧
All right, put them up. Come on.

345
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,200
-你能不能教她一下？ -没问题

-她是谁？ -她来自法律部

And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

349
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,210
-如果你再这样盯着她看 -我需要新的助理 老板
-if you keep ogling her like that. -I need a new assistant, boss.

388
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,260
表情不要太生硬
Stop acting constipated.

389
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,810
-表要露出你的鼻孔 -你的老毛病就是不改
-Don't flare your nostrils. -You are so predictable.

390
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,930
-太令人吃惊了 -看这里
-That's the amazing thing. -Right this way.

-You do? -Yeah.

402
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,370

403
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,210
-你要按摩吗？ -哦 天啊 不
-You want a massage? -Oh, God. No,

404
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,750
-我不需要按摩 -我叫娜塔莉安排
-I don't want a massage. -I'll have Natalie make an...

405
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,250
-我不要娜塔莉安排任何事 -不想让你紧张
-I don't want Natalie to do... -Don't want you tense.

406
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,500
随便说一下 我不是故意不告诉你
By the way, I didn't mean to spring this on you.

407
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,710
多谢了喔
Thank you very much.

408

409
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,380
托尼！是你吗？

410
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,760
-我最讨厌的家伙 -嘿

-贾斯汀・汉默 -还好吗？

412
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,010
你不是唯一开名车的有钱人
You're not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.

413
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,520
这是《浮华世界》的克莉丝汀

414
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,720

-我知道了 -恭喜了
-I know. I know. -Congratulations.

419
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,360
我不访问你的话会被主编骂死
My editor will kill me if I don't grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

420
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,610
-是吗？ -没错
-Can I? -Sure.

421
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,200
她要在《浮华世界》专访我
She's actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.

422
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,200
我顺便让她访问你 你懂的
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

423
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,370
-没错 -没错？
-Right. -Right?

424
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,830
她去年帮托尼“做”过一次专访
Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.

425
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,250
然后也写了一篇报导
And she wrote a story as well.

426
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,380
-令人印象深刻 -写得很好

-非常好  -谢谢你

429
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,590

-Hey, buddy. How you doing? -I'm all right.

430
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,970

-Looking gorgeous. -Please, this is tough.

431
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,680
-我能问你 这是… -奶酪
-Can I ask you... Is this the first time... -Fromage.

432
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,260
-说“布利干酪” -…你们以前认识吗？
-Say, "Brie." -...that you guys have seen each other?

433
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,600
天啊 真恶！受不了！
God, that's so awful.

434
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,060
…你们在听证会后第一次见面
Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?

435
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,810
自从他的合约被取消以后？
Since he got his contract revoked...

436
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,100
-不是 只是暂缓 -…当你企图…
-Actually, it's on hold. -...when you were attempting to...

437
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,190
我听到的可不是这样 与“暂缓”不同的是…
That's not what I heard. What's the difference between "hold"

438
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,110
-和“取消”？事实吗？ -是的 是什么？
-and "cancelled"? The truth? -Yes, what is?

439
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,570
不是 事实是…把录音机关了吧
No. The truth is... Why don't we put that away?

440
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,660
事实是…我想在你的博览会展示产品
The truth is, I'm actually hoping to present something at your Expo.

441
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,120
如果你发明能用的东西
Well, if you invent something that works,

442
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,620
我一定会替你保留展示厅
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

443
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,910
-他只是在开玩笑  -什么？
-Mr Stark, your corner table is ready. -Yes?

444
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,210
其实今年我有一个机会 是的 我有
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

445
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,460
-汉默需要“机会”啦  -不是啦
-Hammer needs a slot, Christine. -We kid, yeah.

446
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,500
我们常常开玩笑
We kid. We're kidders.

447
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,330
“血液毒性：53%"

448
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,900
有更糟的点子吗？
Got any other bad ideas?

449
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
托尼！
Tony!

450
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,270
托尼和我… 托尼…我爱托尼
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.

451
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,420
他也爱我 我们不是竞争对手
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

452
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,550
他退出军售行业以后促使汉默工业加速发展
Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know?

453
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,970
-我和托尼之间的做的任何事… -用途是什么
-Everything that Tony and I do... -Well, what's the use of having...

454
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,930
-有的是良性竞争… -拥有一辆赛车…
-...is a healthy... -...and owning a race car...

455
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,970
-…就是要比赛 -…不然拥有赛车要干嘛？
-...competition. -...if you don't drive it?

456
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,560
他要赛车？
Is he driving?

457
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,530
娜塔莉 娜塔莉！
Natalie. Natalie!

458
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,650
-波兹小姐？ -你知道他要赛车吗？
-Yes, Miss Potts? -Did you know about this?

459
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,950
我也是现在才知道的
This is the first that I have known of it.

460
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,780
他不能赛车
This... This cannot happen.

461
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,530
我了解 我该怎么帮你？
Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?

462
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,870
-哈皮呢？  -他在外面
-Where's Happy? -He's waiting outside.

463
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,830
-去找他 我需要哈皮 -马上就去
-Okay, get him. I need Happy. -Right away.

464
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,710
托尼他…
Tony's... You know, he...

465
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,670
我和托尼不是竞争对手 你明白了吗？
We're not competitive. You know what I mean?

466
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,830
是的 是的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

467
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,880
-恕我失陪一下 -你能不能把你写的念给我听？
-can you excuse me just one second? -Just read me what you wrote.

468
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,170
-我会的 等会儿 -读给我听
-I will. I will, after. -Just read it back to me.

469
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,510
但我得先打通电话
But I have to make one quick phone call.

470
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,670
-你要去哪里？ -这太棒了
-Where are you going? -This is great.

471
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,130
-等一下会有鱼子酱哦  -这东西太棒了
-I've got some caviar coming. -This is great stuff.

472
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,720
-我马上回来 -看！
-I'll be right back. -Look!

473
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,300
那是史塔克
That's Stark.

474
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,550
快走！
Go, go!

475
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,430
坐好了
Hang on.

476
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,210
-把公事箱给我  -拿去
-Give me the case. -Here. Take it.

477
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,880
-钥匙呢？  -在我的口袋
-Where's the key? -It's in my pocket.

478
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,130
有车！
Car!

479
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,190
天啊
Oh, my God!

480
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,330
-你没事吧？ -没事
-Are you okay? -Yeah.

481
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,330
-你是想撞我还是撞他？ -我只想吓吓他
-Were you heading for me or him? -I was trying to scare him.

482
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,410
-因为我分不清楚！ -你疯啦？
-'Cause I can't tell! -Are you out of your mind?

483
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,460
-更好的安保…  -快上车！
-Better security. -Get in the car right now!

484
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,290
我受到攻击！我们需要更好的安保
I was attacked! We need better security.

485
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,630
-快上车！ -你是CEO 需要更好的安保
-Get in the car! -You're CEO. Better security measures.

486
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,460
天啊 真丢脸
God, it's embarrassing.

487
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,550
两年来第一次休假…
First vacation in two years.

488
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,640
我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

489
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,980
-我撞到他了！ -再撞他一次 再一次！
-I got him! -Hit him again. Hit him again.

490
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,940
把箱子给我
Football.

491
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,440
-我撞到他了！ -把公事箱拿去！
-I got him! -Take the case! Take it!

492
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,190
-把公事箱拿去！ -快拿给他！
-Take the case! -Give him the case!

493
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,110
别再撞了！
Stop banging the car!

494
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,620
冷静
Calm down.

495
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,540
天啊！天啊！
God! God!

496
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,790
把公事箱给我 拜托！快点！
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

497
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,930
你…你输了
You... You lose.

498
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,890
你输了 你输了 斯塔克
You lose. You lose, Stark.

499
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,530
我们查过他的指纹

500
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,450
啥都没有 连名字都查不到

501
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,080
我们要去哪里？

502
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,490
那里

503
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,790
我们甚至不确定他会说英语

504
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,380
他连一个字都没说

505
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,800
5分钟

506
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,120
挺先进的科技 不过转速有点低
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low.

507
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,790
你大可以把转速加倍
You could have doubled up your rotations.

508
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,260
让反能量穿过离子化电浆管道
You focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.

509
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,260
有用 但效率不高
It's effective. Not very efficient.

510
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,640
不过还是挺不错的仿冒品
But it's a passable knock-off.

511
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,850
我不懂 只要微调一下
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

512
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,730
你就能靠它赚不少钱
you could have made a solid paycheck.

513
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,980
你可以卖给北韩、中国和伊朗
You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran,

514
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,690
或是直接在黑市兜售
or gone right to the black market.

515
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,740
看来你的朋友都是B咖
You look like you got friends in low places.

516
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,370
你的家族是小偷和屠夫
You come from a family of thieves and butchers.

517
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,040
你跟每一个罪人一样
And now, like all guilty men,

518
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,580
想要重写你的历史
you try to rewrite your own history.

519
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:02,250
忘了斯塔克家族害死的人命
And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.

520
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,680
我的设计图是哪愉来的？
Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?

521
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,680
我父亲 安东・万科
My father. Anton Vanko.

522
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,060
没听过他
Well, I never heard of him.

523
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,850
你没死是因为我父亲
My father is the reason you're alive.

524
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
我没死是因为你想杀死我
The reason I'm alive is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

525
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,730
你却失败
you missed.

526
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,020
是吗？
Did I?

527
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,030
如果你能让上帝流血
If you can make God bleed,

528
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,910
人们就不会相信她
the people will cease to believe in him.

529
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,580
当水中有血迹 就会引来鲨鱼
And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come.

530
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,000
我只要坐在这里看
The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch

531
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,590
世人就会把你吞噬
as the world will consume you.

532
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,760
你要在哪里看世人把我吞噬？
Where will you be watching the world consume me from?

533
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,760
没错 你的牢房 我会送你一块香皂
That's right. A prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap.

534
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,140
托尼 在你走之前
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

535
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,600
钯中毒的死法…很痛苦
palladium in the chest, painful way to die.

536
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,500
真是难以置信 这证明瓶子里的魔鬼已经被放出来了
It's just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle

537
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,040
他却还像个无头苍蝇
and this man has no idea what he's doing.

538
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,880
他把钢铁侠当作玩具
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.

539
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,800
斯塔克先生在听证会上很坚决地说
I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant

540
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,510
钢铁盔甲不会在任何地方出现
that these suits can't exist anywhere else,

541
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,140
不在任何地方出现 从未在任何地方出现
don't exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else,

542
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,560
至少在未来的5至10年内…
at least for five to 10 years,

543
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,270
但我们在摩纳哥却看到 “钢铁盔甲出现了”
and here we are in Monaco realising, "These suits exist now."

544
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,520
静音
Mute.

545
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,110
说真的 他应该颁奖章给我
He should be giving me a medal. That's the truth.

546
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,450
-那是什么？ -你在机上的餐点
-What is that? -This is your in-flight meal.

547
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,620
这是你做的？
Did you just make that?

548
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,130
对 你以为我这3小时在干嘛？
Yeah. Where do you think I've been for three hours?

549
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,300
托尼？
Tony,

550
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,720
你有什么在瞒着我？
what are you not telling me?

551
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,640
我完全不想回家
I don't want to go home. At all.

552
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,600
取消我的生日派对
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

553
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,270
我们在欧洲 去威尼斯住西普亚尼饭店
We're in Europe. Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

554
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,570
-记得吗？  -记得
-Remember? -Oh, yes.

555
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,530
住在那里…
It's a great place to

556
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:35,160
-…有益身体健康 -现在不是好时机
-be healthy. -I don't think this is the right time.

557
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,490
一大堆烂摊子要收拾
We're in kind of a mess.

558
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,200
没错 所以才是好时机
Yeah, but maybe that's why it's the best time.

559
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,330
-因为那时我们… -我身为首席执行官
-'Cause then we... -Well, I think as the CEO,

560
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,540
必须坐镇公司
I need to show up.

561
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,920
你身为首席执行官有权利离开
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

562
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,340
-离开？  -员工休假
-A leave? -A company retreat.

563
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,960
-休假？在这种紧要关头？ -坐坐车就行
-A retreat? During a time like this? -Just a ride.

564
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,630
我们只要再充电就会想出办法
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.

565
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,470
不是每个人都靠电池过活 托尼
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

566
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,370
“请享用洋芋泥”

567
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,560
他来了！
Hey, there he is.

568
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,730
他来了
There he is.

569
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,820
很高兴你来了 欢迎
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

570
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,950
真是的
Oh, goodness gracious.

571
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,580
把我朋友的手铐解开
Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here?

572
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,160
原谅我 我是你的超级粉丝
Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm such a huge fan of yours.

573
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,040
我不想让你留下坏印象
I didn't want to make a first impression like this.

574
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,420
他又不是动物
He's not an animal. Come on.

575
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,960
他是个人 谢谢你
He's a human being. Thank you.

576
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,430
我们不会有事
We're fine.

577
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,770
我叫贾斯汀・汉默
My name is Justin Hammer.

578
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,190
我想跟你做点生意 请坐
I'd like to do some business with you. Please sit.

579
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,400
吃吧 今天有什么菜色？
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

580
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,820
-鲑鱼佐酱汁 -鲑鱼佐酱汁？
-We have some salmon carpaccio. -Salmon carpaccio.

581
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,120
你要什么我们都有
Anything you want here, we got it.

582
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,290
我喜欢先吃甜点 这是从旧金山空运送来的
I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco.

583
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,250
不过是意大利式甜点
It's Italian, though.

584
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,120
有机冰淇淋
Organic ice cream.

585
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,130
我超爱吃甜食 看来你也很想杀死托尼・斯塔克
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

586
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,840
当我看到你在赛车道攻击他
What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track,

587
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,590
你像天兵神将站在他面前
how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody,

588
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,800
大家都觉得太神了
that was... Wow!

589
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,430
你向我传达一个信息
You spoke to me with what you did.

590
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,140
我也知道你知道我一定会听
And I know that you knew that I'd be listening.

591
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,770
所以我不能让他们把你送走
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off

592
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:35,650
白白浪费你的才能
to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.

593
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,070
不过我想给你一个建议
But if I might make a suggestion,

594
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,860
不要就这样跑去想杀死他
you know, you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

595
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,200
我的想法是…要是我就会扼杀他的成就
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

596
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,370
那才叫干掉他
That's what you kill.

597
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:49,450
我们有很多地方很像
You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

598
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:54,170
唯一的不同是我有资源
The only difference between you and I is that I have resources.

599
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,840
我认为你需要我的资源
I think, if I may, you need my resources.

600
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,510
当你的靠山 一位赞助人
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

601
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,680
我想当那个人
I'd like to be that guy.

602
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,860
你会说英语吗？我可以找一个翻译
Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator.

603
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,780
我不确定你听懂我说的话
I don't know. Have you been understanding everything I'm saying?

604
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,280
很好的人
Very good, man.

605
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,530
-超好的 老兄 -很好 老兄
-Very good, man. -Very good, man.

606
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,450
什么事？
Yes?

607
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,120
我要我的小鸟
I want my bird.

608
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,800
-小鸟？你要一只小鸟？ -我要我的小鸟
-A bird? You want a bird? -I want my bird.

609
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,550
我可以给你十只小鸟
I can get you a bird. I can get you 10 birds.

610
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,170
我要我的小鸟
I want my bird.

611
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,800
好 没有不可能的事
Well, okay. Nothing's impossible. I could...

612
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,560
你是说你在俄罗斯的小鸟？
Are we talking about... Is this a bird back in Russia?

613
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,680
尽管发生摩纳哥事件
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong

614
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,690
-本公司的基础仍然很牢固 -是的 当然
-despite the events in Monaco. -Yes, of course.

615
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,230
-美联社要你发言 -把这份声明稿传真给他们
-The AP wants a quote. -Don't tell him. Fax them...

616
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,820
他在哪里？
Where is he?

617
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,690
-他不想被打扰 -他在楼下
-He doesn't want to be disturbed. -He's downstairs.

618
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,240
-在摩纳哥发生什么了？ -但是…
-...what happened in Monaco? -Yes, but...

619
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,820
但是他一直出状况
But his continuing erratic behaviour

620
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:09,030
会让大众质疑
may lead many people to ask themselves,

621
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,950
他能否保护我们？
"Can this man still protect us?"

622
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,330
钢铁侠一直在保护我们 摩纳哥发生的事就是证明
Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.

623
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,000
搜寻完毕 长官 安东・万科是苏联物理学家
Query complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist

624
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,090
1963年叛逃到美国
who defected to the United States in 1963.

625
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:27,340
但是他被指控是间谍 1967年被驱逐出境
However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.

626
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,800
他儿子 伊万 也是物理学家
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,

627
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:34,640
因为在苏联时期倒卖武器级钸材料给巴基斯坦
was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

628
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:37,230
被判在科佩斯克监狱服刑15年
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.

629
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,440
没有其它记录
No further records exist.

630
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,950
托尼？你得上楼把情势控制住
Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now.

631
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,030
我一整天都在和国民兵通电话
Listen. I've been on the phone with the National Guard all day,

632
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,200
说服他们不要开坦克车过来
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH,

633
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,160
撞破你的大门 拿走这些
knocking down your front door and taking these.

634
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,290
他们想拿走你的钢铁盔甲
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?

635
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,290
他们懒得跟你玩游戏
They're sick of the games.

636
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,590
你说20年内没人能拥有这种科技
You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.

637
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,880
猜怎么着…昨天就有人拥有它
Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday.

638
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,300
而且不再是理论
It's not theoretical any more.

639
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,560
你有在听吗？
Are you listening to me?

640
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,310
-你还好吧？ -走吧
-Are you okay? -Let's go.

641
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,950
-你没事吧？ -我要到我的办公桌
-You all right? -Yeah, I should get to my desk.

642
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,160
-看到雪茄盒吗？  -看到了
-See that cigar box? -Yeah.

643
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,160
那是钯能量板
It's palladium.

644
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,630
这玩意应该冒烟吗？
Is that supposed to be smoking?

645
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:48,010
中子受损 是方舟反应炉壁在冒烟
If you must know, it's neutron damage. It's from the reactor wall.

646
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,850
这玩意在你体内？
You had this in your body?

647
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,520
你脖子上的字谜又是怎么回事？
And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?

648
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,020
擦伤的痕迹
Road rash.

649
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,780
谢谢你
Thank you.

650
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,710
-你在看什么？ -我在看你
-What are you looking at? -I'm looking at you.

651
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,840
你不必要一个人当救世主
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

652
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,960
你不必光靠自己
and it's unnecessary. You don't have to do this alone.

653
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,260
我也很想相信你说的
You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do.

654
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,590
但是你得信任我
But you've gotta trust me.

655
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,470
一般人对我有误解 我很清楚我在做什么
Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I'm doing.

656
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,720
（纽约皇后区）

657
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,520
这是我的军火工厂 我的寒舍
This is where we do it. This is my humble abode.

658
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,070
你可以安静地工作 当死人很好玩吧？
You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right?

659
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,570
没有压力？
No pressure.

660
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,660
它们在那里 我很兴奋 它们可以随时作战
Here they are. I'm very excited. They're combat-ready.

661
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,200
我也许算错了一些数据
I may have done a few miscalculations

662
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,290
太急着利用原型大量制造
and rushed the prototype into production.

663
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,250
没办法 我是个急性子
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

664
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,620
随便到处看看
Go ahead, take a look around.

665
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,340
你最好不要那么做
You don't wanna do that.

666
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,090
我们要先设定一些密码 你才能开始操作
You'll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.

667
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,220
快去设定密码给他使用
Can we generate some encrypted pass codes?

668
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,430
“输入密码” 设定哪些密码 杰克
Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.

669
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,630
“准许进入”

670
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,270
算了
Never mind, I...

671
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,810
哇 好吧 好样的
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

672
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,610
-什么？ -你的软件是狗屎
-Sorry? -Software shit.

673
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,030
你很厉害
You're good.

674
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,450
你就这样破解了防火墙
You really blasted in past the firewall there.

675
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,580
让我给你看你要在哪里工作
Let me show you where you're gonna be working primarily.

676
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,630
看吧 仔细看吧
Go ahead, take a look.

677
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,130
你看看 很棒 对吧？
Get a good look at that. That's something, isn't it?

678
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,220
那些钢铁盔甲只是展示品
You know, those are really just for show and tell.

679
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,300
每套价值1亿2千5百70万…等等！噢糟了
They're $1 25.7 million a pop, so... Wait! Oh, gosh.

680
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,310
老天 快找人上来帮忙
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

681
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,730
那是驾驶员的位置
That's where the pilot goes.

682
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,860
不过我找不到自愿者
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

683
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,110
我会搞定 别乱碰
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

684
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,700
你要它们做什么？
What you want them do?

685
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,990
长期来说 我要它们让我能和国防部签下25年的合约
Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

686
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,120
我要让钢铁侠看起来像古董
I want to make Iron Man look like an antique.

687
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,330
我要去斯塔克博览会
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

688
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,330
我要在托尼家的前院拉屎
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.

689
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,830
你知道我们说什么吗？
You know what I'm talking about?

690
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,090
-我办得到 没问题 -是吗？
-I can do that. No problem. -Yeah?

691
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,340
棒呆了 我喜欢
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

692
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,130
我就说他是我们的救星吧？我有预感
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you? I had a feeling.

693
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,340
“钯浓度：89%"

694
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,190
你今晚想戴哪一支手表？
Do you know which watch you'd like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

695
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
我等一下会看
I'll give them a look.

696
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,860
我应该取消派对 对吧？
I should cancel the party.

697
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,190
-大概吧 -是的
-Probably. -Yeah.

698
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,910
-因为真的… -不是时候
-'Cause it's... -Ill-timed.

699
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,490
这会发出错误讯息
Right, sends the wrong message.

700
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,080
很不恰当
Inappropriate.

701
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,210
够烈吗？
Is that dirty enough for you?

702
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,960
金色表面、棕色表带 积家牌手表 让我看看
Gold face, brown band. The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

703
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,920
拿过来
Bring them over here.

704
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,390
我要戴那支 你可以…
I'll take that. Why don't you...

705
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,780
老实说 我摸不清你的底细
I gotta say it. It's hard to get a read on you.

706
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,240
-你来自哪里？ -法律部门
-Where are you from? -Legal.

707
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,080
我能问你一个假设性问题吗？
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically?

708
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,450
这问题有点怪
Bit odd.

709
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,120
如果这是你最后一次生日派对
If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have,

710
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,790
你会怎么庆祝？
how would you celebrate it?

711
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:58,630
想跟谁做什么就做什么
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.

712
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,460
-晚上好  -晚上好
-Good evening. -Good evening.

713
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,330
是的长官 我了解
Yes, sir, I understand.

714
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,670
不 没有这必要 我会处理
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I'll handle it.

715
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,090
我保证24小时内
Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,

716
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,010
钢铁侠就会回到他的岗位
Iron Man will be back on watch.

717
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,810
嘿 小辣椒
Hey, Pepper.

718
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,230
我要走了 我得出去透透气
I'm going to go get some air.

719
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:55,690
怎么了？
What's wrong?

720
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,820
-我不知道该怎么做  -这是在开玩笑吧
-I don't know what to do. -You gotta be kidding me.

721
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:07,620
-够了 我要…小辣椒  -不 不 不 别打给任何人
-That's it. I'm making... Pepper. -No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

722
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,620
太扯了 我才刚替他挂保证
This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

723
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,950
我知道 让我搞定
I know. I know. I get it.

724
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,290
我来搞定好吗？让我来搞定
I'm gonna handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.

725
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,330
快点搞定 不然我就亲自来
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

726
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,170
我最常被问的问题是：
You know, the question I get asked most often is,

727
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,750
你穿了钢铁盔甲要怎么上厕所？
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?"

728
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,590
就像这样
Just like that.

729
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,180
这家伙超会开轰趴 对吧？
Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?

730
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:36,900
我爱你…
I love you.

731
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,650
不可思议 谢谢你 托尼
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

732
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:43,690
谢谢你安排这么美好的夜晚
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.

733
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,780
我们该说晚安了 谢谢大家光临
And we're gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.

734
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,070
不…不…等等…等等…
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.

735
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,950
我们都还没切蛋糕、吹蜡烛
We didn't have the cake. We didn't blow out the candles.

736
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,830
你已经失控了 相信我
You're out of control, okay? Trust me on this one, okay?

737
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,250
-你才美的失控呢 -该上床睡觉了
-You're out of control, gorgeous. -It's time to go to bed. It's time.

738
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,460
-再亲我一下 -你不会
-Give me another smooch. -You're not going to be

739
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,750
-对此感兴趣的 -来吧 知道你要的
-happy about this. -Come on, you know you want to.

740
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,210
你刚才尿钢铁盔甲里
You just peed the suit.

741
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,750
-我知道 它有过滤系统  -它不性感
-I know. It has a filtration system. -It's not sexy.

742
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,260
过滤出来的水可以喝
You could drink that water.

743
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,930
让大家回家吧 时候不早了
Just send everybody home, okay? It's time to...

744
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,760
-你说了算数 -好的
-If you say so. -Okay.

745
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,060
我拿这个 你拿这个
I'll take this, you take that.

746
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,060
小辣椒波兹
Pepper Potts.

747
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,890
她说的对 派对结束了
She's right. The party's over.

748
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,940
派对1个半小时前就该结束了
Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago.

749
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:23,570
15分钟后…开始续摊
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

750
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:31,280
如果有人 包括小辣椒不喜欢这个 大门就在那里
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it, there's the door.

751
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,760
丢！
Hit!

752
00:55:51,930 --> 00:56:03,610
丢！
Pull!

753
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,060
再丢！

754
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,740
让我来！

755
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,790
我猜她喜欢加拉戈尔
I think she wants the Gallagher!

756
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,450
你打中了！

757
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,050
我只要说一次
I'm only gonna say this once.

758
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,880
滚出去
Get out.

759
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,480
你不配穿钢铁盔甲 脱掉它
You don't deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!

760
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,270
小戈
Goldstein.

761
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,730
是的 斯塔克先生
Yes, Mr Stark?

762
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,070
别怕 音乐给它摧下去
Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy's ass to.

763
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,870
我叫你把钢铁盔甲脱掉
I told you to shut it down.

764
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,960
把它放回去 免得有人受伤
Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.

765
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,930
真来呀？
Really?

766
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:28,320
抱歉 钢铁侠不需要助手
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

767
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,150
吃我这一招！
Sidekick this!

768
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,160
玩够了吗？
Had enough?

769
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,540
-娜塔莉！  -波兹小姐
-Natalie! -Miss Potts.

770
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,750
少来了 我早就看穿你的诡计
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

771
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,880
你来了以后就…
You know what? Ever since you came here...

772
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,630
小辣椒！
Pepper!

773
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,510
快闪人吧！
Get out of here. Get out of here.

774
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,520
你要这玩意？拿去！
You want it? Take it!

775
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,980
把手放下
Put your hand down.

776
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,270
你自以为有当钢铁侠的料吗？
You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?

777
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,650
我们不必打来打去
We don't have to do this, Tony.

778
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,610
你想当战争机器 开火呀
You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.

779
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,530
-快放下！  -你想开火吗？
-Put it down! -You gonna take a shot?

780
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,860
-放下来！  -不！
-Put it down! -No!

781
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,410
-放下来 托尼！  -快开火！
-Drop it, Tony! -Take it.

782
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:08,680
（爱德华空军基地）

783
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,850
爱德华兹控制塔 我是詹姆斯・罗德中校
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

784
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,150
从机场以东3哩外进场 处于5000英尺…
inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet...

785
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:17,180
（要求降落在22号停机坪）

786
01:00:58,570 --> 01:00:59,900
中校
Colonel.

787
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,110
少校
Major.

788
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,490
是啊
Yeah.

789
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,250
把它带进去吧
Let's take it inside.

790
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,830
净空这区域！
Clear the area.

791
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,810
先生！
Sir!

792
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,360
请你从甜甜圈上下来！
I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.

793
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,570
我不想加入你的超人男孩团体
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.

794
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,120
我记得 你什么都是自己来
No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.

795
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,410
-结果怎么样？ -结果…结果…
-How's that working out for you? -It's... It's... It's...

796
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,250
抱歉 我不想引起你的误会
I'm sorry. I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

797
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,130
我该看你的眼罩还是眼睛？
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

798
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,340
老实说 我有点宿醉
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

799
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,760
我不确定你是真人还是幻觉
I'm not sure if you're real or if I'm having...

800
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,930
我是真人
I am very real.

801
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,010
我是你见过最真实的人
I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.

802
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:09,770
-我真走运 这里的员工呢？ -这看起来不太妙
-Just my luck. Where's the staff here? -That's not looking so good.

803
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,520
我有过更糟的状况
I've been worse.

804
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:15,230
我净空整个区域
We've secured the perimeter,

805
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,190
不过最好不要花太多时闲
but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.

806
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,610
-你被开除了 -这由不得你来决定
-You're fired. -That's not up to you.

807
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,530
托尼 这是罗曼诺夫特工
Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

808
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,740
我是神盾局的卧底特工
I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

809
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,450
当我们知道你病了 福瑞局长就派我来观察你
Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

810
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,370
你最好向我道歉
I suggest you apologise.

811
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,000
你一直都很忙
You've been very busy.

812
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,340
你把小辣椒任命为首席执行官 把你的财产到处送人
You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff.

813
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,420
还让你朋友穿着钢铁盔甲飞走！
You let your friend fly away with your suit.

814
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,880
要不是我了解状况…
Now, if I didn't know better...

815
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,970
我没有给他 是他抢走的
You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.

816
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,720
什么？是他抢走的？
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

817
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,020
你是钢铁侠 他就这样抢走？
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

818
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,890
他痛扁你一顿 抢走你的钢铁盔甲
The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?

819
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,190
这有可能吗？
Is that possible?

820
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,900
根据斯塔克先生的安检程序
Well, according to Mr Stark's database security guidelines,

821
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,980
系统可以避免未授权使用
there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.

822
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,410
-你要我做什么？ -我们要你做什么？
-What do you want from me? -What do we want from you?

823
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,370
应该是你要我做什么？
What do you want from me?

824
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,120
你变成我得处理的问题人物
You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.

825
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,460
你可能想错了 我的世界不是绕着你运行的
Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe.

826
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,580
西南区有比你更大的问题
I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.

827
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,710
打针吧
Hit him.

828
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,260
你们是要拿走我的肾脏去卖吗？
Oh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

829
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,640
可不可以别再做这些怪事
Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds?

830
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,850
-她刚才对我做了什么？ -我们是为了你好
-What did she just do to me? -What did we just do for you?

831
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,350
那是二氧化锂 能减缓你的病征
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.

832
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,310
我们想让你回去工作
We're trying to get you back to work.

833
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,480
再给我两盒我就会好起来
Give me a couple of boxes of that. I'll be right as rain.

834
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,480
那不是解药 只能减缓病征
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

835
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,070
看来要治好你并不容易
Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.

836
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:46,360
相信我 我知道 我了解状况
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

837
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,820
我一直在找钯元素的替代品
I've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.

838
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:53,330
我试过每种元素的每种组合
I've tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.

839
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,500
我是来告诉你 你还没全部试过
Well, I'm here to tell you, you haven't tried them all.

840
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,080
你有快递！
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

841
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,710
使命必达！
Candygram.

842
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,380
我带了东西给你
I brought you something.

843
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,720
没错
Oh, yeah.

844
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,100
我们找到你的小鸟 兄弟！
We got you the bird, pal.

845
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,520
这不是我的小鸟
This is not my bird.

846
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,020
什么意思？这就是那只小鸟
What do you mean? That's the bird. This is the bird.

847
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,900
我靠很多关系才找到的
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.

848
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,270
这是只很棒的小鸟
This is a great bird.

849
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,980
-而且很漂亮 -大老远从俄罗斯找来的
-It's a beautiful bird. -We got this all the way from Russia.

850
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,530
老兄 这不是我的小鸟
Hey, man, this not my bird.

851
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,790
嗯听着 就算不是你那只小鸟 这只小鸟也很漂亮
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

852
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,660
别这么固执
I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things.

853
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,460
你得学会放手
Learn to let go.

854
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,710
等一下 杰克 那是什么？
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

855
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:48,380
那…那不是头盔 那是什么？
Is that... That's not a helmet. What is that?

856
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:00,440
伊万？那是什么？杰克
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

857
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,440
那是头盔吗？看起来不像
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

858
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,110
你要怎么把头塞进去？
How... How are you supposed to get a head in there?

859
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,030
-杰克 你的头塞得进去吗？ -不
-Jack, could you put your head in there? -No.

860
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:11,320
试着把头塞进去 试试看 试着塞进去
Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

861
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,070
伊万 他的头塞不进去
See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there.

862
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,540
那不是头盔 那是一颗头 我得把一个人装进去
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head. I need to put a guy in there.

863
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:22,000
这套钢铁盔甲要能穿 你了吗？
I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

864
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,460
-摇控钢铁士兵比较好 -摇控钢铁士兵比较好？
-Drone better. -What? Drone better?

865
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,130
为什么比较好？
Why is drone better? Why is drone better?

866
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,010
人会出错
People make problem.

867
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,970
相信我 摇控比较好
Trust me. Drone better.

868
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:35,600
伊万 你知道我喜欢你 我还替你弄到小鸟
Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.

869
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,310
你说没问题
You said, "No problem."

870
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:41,310
是你说的 你说没问题
That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem."

871
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,190
现在我要钢铁盔甲 政府要的是钢铁盔甲
Now I need suits. The government wants suits.

872
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,270
像钢铁侠一样！你了吗？
Like Iron Man. You understand?

873
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,480
那是大家要的！这样他们才高兴
That's what the people want. That's what's gonna make them happy.

874
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,650
老兄
Hey, man.

875
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,780
别这么固执
Don't get too attached to things.

876
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,200
你得学会放手
Learn to let go.

877
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,290
这些钢铁士兵最好能一炮而红
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

878
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,340
了吗？它们最好能让我出名！
You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

879
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,600
不可思议
Unbelievable.

880
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:22,730
这样一来参议院就不会再烦我
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

881
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,190
-它能用吗？ -完全能够执行任务
-It's functional? -Fully mission-capable.

882
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,940
很好 请汉默替它装上武器
Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.

883
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,990
长官？
Sir?

884
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,700
汉默要在博览会上展示新武器
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.

885
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,410
我们要用这个来做开场
We'd like this to introduce it.

886
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,070
我不认为博览会适合…
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

887
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,950
中校 世人需要看到这玩意
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.

888
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,080
-我们必须满足他们 -是的 将军 但是…
-We've got to make this happen. -Yes, General, but...

889
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,170
这也是个命令
It's also an order.

890
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,880
遵命 长官
Yes, sir.

891
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,710
干得好 中校 国家以你为荣
Good work, Colonel. You've made your country proud.

892
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,420
谢谢你 长官
Thank you, sir.

893
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,310
你胸口的那玩意是根据未完成的科技做的
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

894
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,430
不 它是完成品
No, it was finished.

895
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,650
我把它缩小后才起了功效
It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

896
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,860
不 你爸说方舟反应炉…
No. Howard said the arc reactor

897
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,690
只是更伟大的科技的跳板
was the stepping stone to something greater.

898
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,280
他当年准备展开一场能量竞争 会让所有对手望尘莫及
He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

899
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,910
他摸索到了一种超能量的头绪
He was on to something big,

900
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,450
核子反应炉在相较之下…
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor

901
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,540
会像是一枚3A电池
look like a triple-A battery.

902
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,120
只有他吗？安东・万科也有参与吧？
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

903
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,290
安东・万科就像铜板的另一面
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.

904
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,420
他认为那是发大财的方法
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

905
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,880
你父亲发现后就把他驱逐出境
When your father found out, he had him deported.

906
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,880
当老俄发现他没有用处
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver,

907
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,510
就把他下放到西伯利亚
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

908
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,350
20年来过着酗酒愤世的生活
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.

909
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,970
对小孩成长不是很好
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,

910
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,190
你在摩纳哥遇到就是他儿子
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

911
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:49,900
你说我没全部试过
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

912
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,190
什么意思？我没试过什么？
What do you mean I haven't tried everything? What haven't I tried?

913
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,530
他说只有你有资源和智慧…
He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge

914
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,660
去完成他开始的计划
to finish what he started.

915
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,240
他这么说？
He said that?

916
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,030
他说的是你吗？
Are you that guy? Are you?

917
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:08,420
如果是你…你就能解开你的心头之谜
'Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

918
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,170
我不知道你是怎么知道这些事
I don't know where you get your information,

919
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,510
但他并不是很肯定我
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

920
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:17,970
你记得你爸什么？
What do you remember about your dad?

921
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,760
他很冷漠 重心计
He was cold, he was calculating.

922
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,600
从来没说过他爱我 也从来没说过他喜欢我
He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,

923
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,260
对我来说很难理解的是
so it's a little tough for me to digest

924
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,810
你来告诉我说所有的未来都取决于我自己
when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me

925
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,850
而且他把这个责任传承给我 我不明白
and he's passing it down. I don't get that.

926
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,190
他最高兴的一天
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day

927
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,770
是把我送到寄宿学校
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

928
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:33,940
并不是这样
That's not true.

929
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,690
那么很显然你比我更了解我爸
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

930
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:40,780
事实上没错 他是成立神盾局的成员之一
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

931
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,030

-What's this? -Okay, you're good, right?

934
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,120
-不 我不可以 -你能解开 对吧？
-No, I'm not good. -You got this? Right? Right?

935
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,080
我连要解开什么都不知道
Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.

01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,730
-六块钱 -我没有钱
-$6. Six. -I don't have any dough.

1042
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,400
-用这个换 -不行 这太多了
-Here. -No, sir, that's too much.

1043
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,650
不 没关系 拿着吧
No, it's fine. Take that.

1044
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,780
-没事的 -不行啦 先生
-It's fine. -No, se?or.

1045
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:19,990
快拿去吧 我不喜欢别人拿东西给我
Take it. Take it. I don't like people handing me things.

1046
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,990
请你把它放在那里
If you just drop that there, that'd be great.

1047
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:24,950
-你是钢铁侠吗？ -有时候是
-Are you Iron Man? -Sometimes.

1048
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,830
我们相信你！
We believe in you.

1049
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:30,000
这算非法没收私人财物
It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.

1050
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,500
-波兹小姐？  -放轻松
-Miss Potts? -Relax.

1051
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,670
-斯塔克先生… -在这儿
-Mr Stark... -Is here.

1052
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,590
-他不肯…  -对 没关系
-He refuses... -I don't. It's fine.

1053
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,260
-我只要一下子  -注意 我们的立场是
-I'll just be a second. -Listen, it's our position

1054
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,590
斯塔克工业继续拥有…
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1055
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,430
马克二号钢铁盔甲的产权
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.

1056
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:45,260
当斯塔克先生宣布他是钢铁侠
When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,

1057
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:47,520
-他向美国承诺过 -不 这个钢铁外套属于我们
-he was making a promise to America. -No, the suit belongs to us.

1058
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,520
他说过会保护我们
We trusted that he would look out for us.

1059
01:16:49,650 --> 01:16:51,690
-嗯 但是你没…伯特… -他很显然并没有
-Yeah, but you're not... Burt... -He obviously did not.

1060
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,110
-现在我们发现他的秘书 -不 是的
-And now we learn that his secretary... -Yes, it does.

1061
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,530
一个叫小辣椒波兹的女生
...a woman named Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1062
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,360
居然被任命为斯塔克工业首席执行官
has been appointed as CEO of Stark lndustries.

1063
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,950
她有什么资历？
What are her qualifications?

1064
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:02,110
-不 -波兹小姐
-No. -Ms Potts is doing

1065
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,370
根本什么资历都…
nothing to manage this terrible...

1066
01:17:03,450 --> 01:17:04,950
-静音 -不…
-Mute. -No...

1067
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,790
柏特…听我说
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1068
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,290
别跟我说我们有最好的律师
Don't tell me that we have the best patent laWyers in the country

1069
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,500
然后说你不让我追诉下去
and then not let me pursue this.

1070
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,960
我会把东西拿走…
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1071
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,880
那就叫总统签署行政命令
Well, then, tell the President to sign an order.

1072
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,130
我们在博览会上再说
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1073
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:22,220
汉默明天要举行展示会
Hammer's giving some presentation tomorrow evening.

1074
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,180
-托尼也会去吗？ -我会去吗？
-Will Tony Stark be there? -Will I?

1075
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,060
-不 他不会去 再见  -我很想去
-No, he will not. Bye. -I would like to be.

1076
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,390
-有空吗？  -没有
-Got a minute? -No.

1077
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,230
你才讲完电话 只要30秒
Come on, you just got off the phone. You're fine, 30 seconds.

1078
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:36,980
29秒…28秒…
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1079
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,730
我开车过来的时候…
I was just driving over here,

1080
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,320
还想来道歉 但现在我不了
and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I'm not.

1081
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:44,160
-你不是来道歉的？ -不必说你也知道
-You didn't come here to apologise? -Look, that goes without saying,

1082
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,830
我正在努力
and I'm working on that.

1083
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:49,910
但我并没有完全跟你说实话
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you,

1084
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,160
我只想跟你和好
and I just want to try to make good.

1085
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,580
我能把这玩意移走吗？这太扯了
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1086
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,750
就像摩天轮一样
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1087
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,000
-我试着想要…  -不行
-I'm trying to get some... -No.

1088
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,090
你知道人生有多短吗？
Do you know how short life is?

1089
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:04,260
我从来没有机会表达…
And if I never got to express...

1090
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,010
我也是最近才领悟到这一点
And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1091
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,520
我不在乎…我是说我在乎…
And I don't care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1092
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,270
我并不期望你…
I'm not expecting you to...

1093
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:12,520
听好 我只想说的是
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1094
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,440
-我要说这个  -让我先阻止你说下去 好吗？
-I'm just gonna say it. -Let me stop you right here, okay?

1095
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,020
要是你再说一次“我”…
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1096
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,900
我就要拿东西砸你的头
I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.

1097
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,360
我试着经营一家公司
I am trying to run a company.

1098
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:25,030
-你知道这有多难吗？ -知道
-Do you have any idea what that entails? -Yes.

1099
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,120
大家都期待你当钢铁侠 你却消失无踪
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared,

1100
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,540
我只能替你灭火 被别人痛骂
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it.

1101
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,630
我正在试着做你应该做的事
I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.

1102
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:43,720
你带了草莓给我？
Did you bring me strawberries?

1103
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,220
你知道全世界我只对一样东西过敏吗？
Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1104
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,600
草莓…
Allergic to strawberries.

1105
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,140
这是进步 小辣椒
This is progress, Pepper.

1106
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,980
我就知道你和草莓有关联
I knew there was a correlation between you and this.

1107
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,150
-我需要你… -我也需要你…
-I need you... -I need you, too.

1108
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:01,900
-…马上离开 -那就我尽力想…
-...to leave now. -That's what I'm trying to...

1109
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,490
波兹小姐？
Ms Potts?

1110
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,450
-嗨 请进 -25分钟后起飞
-Hi, come on in. -Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1111
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,330
谢谢你
Thank you.

1112
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,580
-还要什么吗 老板？ -没有了
-Anything else, boss? -I'm good, Hap.

1113
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,800
我还好…我马上就来
No, I'll be just...another minute.

1114
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,420
我好像离了婚又失去两个小孩
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1115
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,760
不
No.

1116
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:36,020
你融入得还好吧 娜塔莉？我是说融入斯塔克工业
Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here at Stark Enterprises?

1117
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,440
你叫娜塔莉 对吧？
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1118
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,440
我以为你们俩不合
I thought you two didn't get along.

1119
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,860
-并没有 -你只是不关心我了
-No. That's not so. -It's just me you don't care for.

1120
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:48,450
-完全没反应？ -你人都来了
-No? Nothing? -Actually, while you're here,

1121
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,620
就可以和娜塔莉讨论私人物件
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.

1122
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,160
当然了
Absolutely.

1123
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,630
你就是不肯闭嘴 是吧？
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

1124
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:01,790
你超厉害的
Boy, you're good.

1125
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,460
你很会装B的 你是怎么做到的？
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it?

1126
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,380
你这个三面间谍
You just tear things... You're a triple impostor.

1127
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,720
我没见过你这种人 你有什么是真的吗？
I've never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you?

1128
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,890
你真的会说拉丁语吗？
Do you even speak Latin?

1129
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,250
（拉丁语）

1130
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,720
什么意思？你刚刚说什么？
Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?

1131
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:18,060
意思是你可以自己回家或者我派人押你回去
It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.

1132
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:21,060
你太厉害了！
You're good.

1133
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:54,090
“未来之钥在这里”

1134
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,500
贾维斯 请你做出数位模型
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?

我需要一个可操作投影画面
I need a manipulatable projection.

1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.

1137
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:36,760
（模型扫瞄完毕）

1138
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,020
总共有几楝建筑物？
How many buildings are there?

1139
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,560
包括比利时松饼摊位吗？
Am I to include the Belgian waffle stands?

1140
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,190
我只是问问 秀给我看
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1141
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,580
这看起来像什么？有点像原子
What does that look like to you, Jarvis? Not unlike an atom.

1142
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:07,170
原子核应该在这里
In which case the nucleus would be here.

1143
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:10,340
把大地球仪突显出来
Highlight the unisphere.

1144
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,140
-把走道拿掉 全都丢掉 -你想达成什么？
-Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them. -What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1145
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:26,060
我想发现…更正
I'm discovering... Correction.

1146
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:30,150
我想重新发现一个新元素
I'm rediscovering a new element, I believe.

1147
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,950
把景观弄掉 灌木丛、树木
Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.

1148
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:36,370
停车场、出口、入口

爸
Dad.

1151
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:17,410
你死了20年还要替我上课？
Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.

1152
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:28,210
你发现的新元素应该能取代你在用的钯元素
The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.

1153
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,380
谢了 老爸
Thanks, Dad.

1154
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:32,710
可惜的是 无法合成出来
Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.

1155
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:40,800
准备进行大翻修 伙计 是时候流些汗了
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We're back in hardware mode.

1156
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,440
-听说你离开过 -是的
-I heard you broke the perimeter. -Yeah.

1157
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,940
那是上辈子的事 你去哪里了？
That was, like, three years ago. Where you been?

1158

-我有事 -是吗？我也是 而且成功了
-I was doing some stuff. -Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1159

我在和你们合作
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Coulson,

替你们的男孩团体做事
you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1161
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:43,160
你要让我干活还是找我殖？
Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?

1162
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
这怎么会在这里？
What's this doing here?

1163
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:50,370
就是这个
That's it.

1164
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,790
-拿给我  -你知道这是什么？
-Bring that to me. -You know what this is?

1165
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,380
有用的东西
It's exactly what I need to make this work.

1166
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,380
抬一下管道
Lift the coil.

1167
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,220

Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1168
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,850
很好 然后…
There you go. And...

1169
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:05,810
放下去 放下去

1174

1175

1176

1177
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,870

接近最高能量

1180
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,080
很简单嘛
That was easy.

1181
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,590
恭喜了
Congratulations, sir.

1182
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,810
你创造了一个新元素

反应炉接受更新后的核心

1185
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,490
嘿 伊万
Hey, Ivan.

Thought we'd swing over and look at some of the drone designs.

1188
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,210
钢铁士兵还没准备好
The drone is not going to be ready.

1189
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,710
你是什么意思？
Not ready? What do you mean?

1190
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,260
我只能展示 不能示范
I can make presentation, not demonstration.

1191
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,340
那有什么不同？
What the hell is the difference?

1192
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:49,220
展示 不能飞 不能开火
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1193
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:51,350
等等 等等 等等 等等
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1194
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,560
你能让它们做什么？这是一场军火秀
What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

什么意思？敬礼？
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1197
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,610
那是什么意思 伊万？这不是我们讲好的条件吗？
What the hell does that mean, lvan? This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1198
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:06,320
你答应要做钢铁盔甲 然后答应要做钢铁士兵
You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.

1199
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,530
-老兄 一切都会好的 -这不是我要的
-Hey, man, everything will be okay. -This is not what I wanted.

1200
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:25,260
他在这里 鸟人！
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1201
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,430
你开始喜欢这只鸟了 对吧？这是你的鸟吗？我被搞混了
Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1202
01:28:33,390 --> 01:28:36,770
你说不是 现在却很麻吉
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1203
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:40,770
你很爱那只鸟对吧？ 把那只鸟拿走
You love that bird, don't you? You know what? Take the bird.

1204
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,450
把他的两个枕头也拿走
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1205
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,660
还有他的鞋子
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1206
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,410
我拿走你的东西
I took your stuff.

1207
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,670
感觉怎样？很不爽吗？
How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad?

1208
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:04,090
很好 因为我也超不爽的！
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1209
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:07,920
我们签了合约
We had a contract.

1210
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:10,300
我救你一命
I saved your life

1211
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:13,100
你给我钢铁盔甲
and you give me suits.

1212
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,350
这是我们的条件
That was our deal.

1213
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:17,470
你却没有做到
And you did not deliver.

1214
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:22,810
我不知道你是天才或骗子 我不知道你是什么
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud. I don't know what you are.

1215
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:28,490
幸好从天上掉下一个礼物
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

1216
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:32,320
不然你就会把我害惨了
And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1217
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:36,370
现在我拥有改良版的史氏科技
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.

1218
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,370
你那高价的的钢铁士兵
And now your overpriced paperweights

1219
01:29:38,450 --> 01:29:41,040
只能当我的作为示范布景的道具
are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1220
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,790
你懂我的意思吗？
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1221
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,300
也许你还没搞清楚 我听不懂俄文！
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!

1222
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,550
我现在要离开
I'm gonna leave now.

1223
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,720
我要去参加博览会了 搞不好能泡到MM
I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid.

1224
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,310
这些家伙是你的保母
You see these guys? They're your babysitters.

1225
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,980
千万别惹毛他们
They are not to be trifled with.

1226
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,230
等我回来再重新谈
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate

1227
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,650
合约的条件
the terms of our agreement.

1228
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,320
你一定要做到你答应做的事
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement

1229
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,950
要是你做不到
because if you don't,

1230
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,450
你就会跟以前我发现你时一样
you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you,

1231
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:17,200
是个死人
a dead man.

1232
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,700
懂了吗？
You got that?

1233
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:22,000
也许你能在电视上看到我
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1234
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,800
老兄 能把这里打扫干净吗？晕死我了
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me.

1235
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,300
-你知道我不…  -来电了

考森 迷人仙境如何？
Coulson. How's the Land of Enchantment?

1239
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,770
托尼 你好吗？
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

1240
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,400
-我加倍了转速 -什么？
-I double cycle. -You what?

1241
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,280
你叫我加倍转速制造更多能量 很好的建议
You told me double cycle's more power. Good advice.

1242
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,280
你这死人头听起来精神很好
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

1243
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,870
你也是
You, too.

1244
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:00,790
-追踪来电 -先生
-Trace him. -Sir.

What your father did to my family over 40 years,

1254
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,570
追踪失败
Call trace incomplete.

1255
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,940

1256
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,750
-先生！ -你就这样进行测试吧

马上组装钢铁盔甲
And assemble the suit while you're at it. Put it together now.

-We are unclear as to the effects... -I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

味道像椰子
That tastes like coconut.

1260

还有金属
And metal.

1267
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,850
各位先生女士 长久以来
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1268
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:51,480
我们国家让英勇的士兵冒险作战
this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm's way,

1269
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,270
后来钢铁侠出现了
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1270
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,030
我们以为不会再失去人命
and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us.

1271
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,610
但是他却不肯公开先进科技
Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach.

1272
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,030
这不公平 也不对
That's not fair. That's not right.

1273
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,370
-而且太可惜了 -天啊
-And it's just too bad. -Oh, Lord.

1274
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:07,540
不过那仍是很棒的发明
Regardless, it was an impressive innovation,

1275
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:10,540
成为世界各地的头条新闻
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

1276
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,540
今天 朋友们
Well, today, my friends,

1277
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:16,090
各大报社的麻烦大了
the press is faced with quite a different problem.

1278
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,090
他们的油墨将不够用
They are about to run out of ink.

1279
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,600
把这玩意移开
Get that out of here.

1280
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,430
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen,

1281
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,850
今天我将为大家介绍

That's a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1290
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,220
虽然这是革命性的科技
But as revolutionary as this technology is,

1291
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:47,010
但是仍然需要把真正的士兵派遣到战场上
there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.

1299
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:47,240
托尼 这里有平民
Tony, there are civilians present.

1300
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,950
我是奉命行事 别在这里开打
I'm here on orders. Let's not do this right now.

1301
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,330
向他们挥手

All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here.

1304

现在你一定要信任我
You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.

1305

我试过 结果在你家被打得很惨
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?

1306
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,090
听好 我认为他和万科合作
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1307
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,800
万科还活着？
Vanko's alive?

1308
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,510
他在哪里？
Where is he?

01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,820
-是你吗？ -不是我 那不是我
-Is that you? -No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1314

我动不了 我被锁死了 我被锁死了！
I can't move. I'm locked up. I'm locked up!

Get out of here. Go! This whole system's been compromised.

1316
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:32,830
我们到外面再打吧
Let's take it outside.

1317
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,610

01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,180
-是什么意思？ -他控制了钢铁士兵
-What does that mean? -I think he slaved the drones.

1326

That's impossible.

1327
01:37:36,430 --> 01:37:38,100

那就打给他们的手机
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1329
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,940
手机也没有讯号
Their cell phones are not working, either, sir.

1330

Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian?

What do you mean you're not dying? Did you just say you're dying?

1396
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,550
是你吗？不 我没死
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1397
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,180
-我不会死了 -发生什么事？

1398
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:17,020
我本来要告诉你
I was going to tell you. I didn't want to alarm you.

1399

-You didn't let me. -Why didn't you tell me that?

1401
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,270
上次煎蛋卷的时候本来要说
I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.

1417
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,730
我应该更信任你
No. I should have trusted you more.

1418
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:08,400
是我害你的 算了吧
I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

1484
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:39,040
你说什么？你不干了？
What did you just say? You're done?

1485
01:52:40,340 --> 01:52:43,840
