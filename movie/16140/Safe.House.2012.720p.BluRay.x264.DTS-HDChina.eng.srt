1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000


2
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:21,187
--==藏身之所==--

3
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,133
我要跟Parker谈谈今天的推广活动
I'm going to talk to Parker about my promotion today.

4
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,013
最坏的情况下，你要提前两周
In the worst-case scenario you're two weeks ahead of me,

5
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,183
你在Marais区域不是有套小别墅
you get a gorgeous little apartment in the Marais.

6
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,685
如果我不想住在哪里呢？
What if I don't want to live in the Marais?

7
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,520


8
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,315
我们可以住到别出去，然后
We couId live somewhere else, then.

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,776
是吗？好的
Yeah? Yeah.

10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,402
我们可以去底特律
We could go to Detroit.

11
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,487
底特律？
Detroit?

12
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,697
是啊，你可以见到我爸爸妈妈
Yeah, you could meet my mom and dad.

13
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,035
你还能看到我姐姐，她有一家小面包店
You can meet my sister.She owns a bakery,

14
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,078
会让你变胖~
and she will make you fat.

15
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,663


16
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,219
在我回医院之前，还有六个小时
I have six hours before I have to go back to the hospital.

17
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,765
你想跟我回到床上去？
You want to go back into bed with me?

18
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,643
嗯
I do.

19
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:24,727


20
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,772
但是我一上午都有会要开
But I got back-to-back meetings all morning.

21
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,358
太惨了
Too bad for you.

22
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,859
是啊，我知道
Yeah, I know.

23
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,528
但是，我得进去了
But I got to get in.

24
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,654
可能已经有25人在门外
There's probabIy already 25 people

25
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,405
排队和等待了
lined up outside the door, waiting.

26
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,578
(法语)
(speak French)

27
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,374
我喜欢你讲法语的样子
I love when you speak French.

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,921


29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,554


30
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,223


31
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,516
通信检查
Satcom check.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,602
呼叫 9 3 维克多 呼叫 2
Echo Nine Three Victor Echo Two.

33
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,563
中心
Ops Center.

34
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,815
这里是安全屋，我们开业啦
This is safe house 7-R.we're open for business.

35
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,899
确认
Confirmed.

36
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,651
留活口么？
Any reservations?

37
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,902
不在考虑中
Nothing in the registry.

38
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,153
步行进入？
Walk-ins?

39
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,156
不需要，三小时内重新确认
Not expected.Reconfirm in three hours.

40
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,783
明白
Understood.

41
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,460


42
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,171


43
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,676
matt 你的手机，真的吗？
Matt? Your cell, really?

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,804
放心，我已经加密了
Relax, l've got an encryption packet.

45
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,890
你知道的，我永远不会放心
You know me,I never relax.

46
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,058
Watch the cholesterol,old man.

47
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,476
You sound like Miriam.

48
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,228
So, what's new in Cape Town?

49
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,396
Nothing, nothing.

50
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,107
I updated my Surveillance Target Analysis.It's compIete now.

51
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,484
Yeah, that's an exit report.It's not due until you leave.

52
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,529
Exactly. Exactly.And when is that?

53
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,655
How long has it been?

54
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,324
Twelve months.

55
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Well, talk to me in another four.

56
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,703
David, I'm dying here.

57
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,747
What's happening with the post in Paris?

58
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,999
One slot,37 applicants.

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,418
Every one of them with more field experience than you.

60
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,378
How am I supposed to get more experience?

61
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,547
I'm staring at four walls all day.

62
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,258
I got passed up on Rome,then Berlin.

63
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,885
You said yourseIf,my evaluation was excellent.

64
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,762
Just put it in front of Whitford.

65
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,348
I know he'll see that l'm ready to go,I'm all in.

66
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,142
Matt, I know this has been hard,

67
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,227
but it's the way the system works.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,773
Look, I'll talk to Whitford about Paris,but I can't promise anything.

69
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,899


70
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,983
Look, I've got to go.

71
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,737
Don't worry,I'm looking after you, okay?

72
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,531
Yeah, I know,I know, I know.

73
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,741


74
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,303


75
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,985
This is not a negotiation.

76
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,407
It's 10 million.

77
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,200
You'll get the file,and if the money

78
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,035
is not in the account by 3:00 p.m. ,

79
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,955
I'll take it to another buyer.

80
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,250
How do we know that you won't do that anyway?

81
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:37,461
You don't.

82
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,046


83
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,346


84
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,479
Here you are, sir.

85
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,401
Alec, how are you?

86
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,993
Petrus, 1972.

87
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,828
You look good.

88
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,122
I do, don't I?

89
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,877
So, how are things at MI6?

90
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:22,048
The usual.Same bureaucratic bullshit and appalling remuneration.

91
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,215
Life of a government man.

92
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,341
Mmm-hmm.

93
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,555
So. . .

94
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,310
The original file.

95
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,188
Dates,transactions, names.

96
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,939
A bargain at triple the price.

97
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,400
Take a look.

98
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,943
Hmm.

99
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,905


100
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,408
I've been waiting a long time for this.

101
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,497
Tobin. . .

102
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,791
What's in that box is going to make

103
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,209
the world a smaller place for you,

104
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,460
for both of us.

105
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,464
I got your account.

106
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,092
You get your cut 24 hours after transaction.

107
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,718
Some of our old bosses aren't going to be happy

108
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,637
these files are out in the open.

109
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,348
Do I make you nervous?

110
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,684
Always.Good.

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,555


112
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,750


113
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,836


114
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,023
You want her?

115
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,676


116
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:13,928


117
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,012


118
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,350


119
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,871
Please, listen to me.

120
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,165
I had nothing to do with this.

121
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,500
Stop.

122
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,589


123
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:52,925
Let's go.

124
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:58,931


125
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,269
Tobin, you have to believe me.

126
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,896
I knew nothing about any of that.

127
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,564
Did you know if anybody was following you?

128
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,776
No, I don't think anybody was following me.

129
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,486
I swear on my life,Tobin, I had absolutely. . .

130
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,696


131
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,364


132
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,532


133
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,703


134
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,914


135
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
Slow down.

136
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,074


137
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,756


138
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,553
We're going by foot.

139
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,597
Head towards the square.

140
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,933


141
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,985


142
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,031


143
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,324


144
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,999
Move! Move! Move!

145
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,004


146
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,135
We're heading west.

147
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,595
Holland Street.Move, move.

148
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,548
Excuse me, sir.Thank you.

149
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,864
My name is Tobin Frost.

150
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,536


151
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,205
Linklater.

152
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,959
When?

153
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,504
Lock down the consulate.

154
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,131
Get me a team in the Situation Room in five minutes.

155
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,633
I want everything we got on Tobin Frost.

156
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,717
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,139
Is it him?Yep.

158
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,224
Whitford know?

159
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,642
I'm on my way there now.

160
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,778
Sir,place your finger in there until I tell you to stop.

161
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,154


162
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,239
Thank you.

163
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,657


164
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,952
So how long has he been playing in your backyard?

165
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,870
We're working to get you that answer right now.

166
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,955
Meaning you don't know.

167
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,456
No, meaning,we're looking into it.

168
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,251
The guy goes rogue,he spends nine years

169
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,044
selling out the Agency to all takers.

170
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,171
To Russia, China, Iran,you name it.

171
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,006
The guy is just not going to prance

172
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,175
into an American consulate without good reason.

173
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:46,677


174
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,972
All right, listen up.

175
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,306
Everybody off the phone.

176
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,103
Tobin Frost has just waltzed his way

177
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,647
into a U.S. Consulate in Cape Town, South Africa.

178
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,774
Now this man,without question,

179
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,985
is one of the most notorious traders that we've got.

180
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,987
Errington, call up his background profile.

181
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,742
Tobin Frost was recruited into the Agency in 1984.

182
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,870
He tested off the charts in aptitude for psychological field work.

183
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,666
His first assignment was in Lebanon,in January 1985.

184
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,127
Three months later,he captured and flipped

185
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,503
a high-ranking Hezbollah leader.

186
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,714
Over the next severaI years,

187
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,509
Frost successfuIIy questioned and recruited many high-vaIue individuaIs.

188
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,512
He became known as an expert manipulator of human assets,

189
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,432
and he literally rewrote Agency interrogation protocols.

190
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,017
Frost served in many active theaters,

191
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,936
including Libya from 1995 to 1998,

192
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,688
Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

193
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,356
During his tenure in Jordan,

194
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,317
Frost was suspected of leaking information to Mossad,

195
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,527
but nothing was confirmed.

196
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,946
Ten years ago,Frost went off the reservation completely.

197
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,990
He currentIy has no allegiances

198
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,701
and is wanted for espionage on four continents.

199
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,580
His last known sighting is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011 .

200
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,916
You know, Harlan,we should interrogate Frost now.

201
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,418
Sweat him for everything he's got.

202
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,503
Once he's stateside,we have fewer options.

203
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,631
I have an interrogator in Yemen,can be there in eight hours.

204
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,924
I already have a team in Jo'burg that can be there in two.

205
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,843
We'll take Frost to the safe house,interrogate him there.

206
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,803
My people are fully capable of handling this.

207
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,680
This is Tobin Frost.

208
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,393
We'll go with Jo'burg.

209
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,356
Okay.

210
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,484


211
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,904
You must turn around.

212
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,743
Help. Help.

213
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,789


214
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,082
Accident.

215
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,542


216
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,631


217
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,219
Housekeeping.

218
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,721
We have a last-minute reservation.

219
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,098
ETA for check-in?

220
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,725
Sometime tonight.Freeark Insurance.

221
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,102
Got it.

222
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,314


223
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,066


224
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,526
Hello. Hey.

225
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,610
Hey, where are you?

226
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,154
Parker just handed me his oversight papers to finish

227
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,824
and his daughter Chloe's got the measles,can you believe that?

228
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,617
How long are you going to be out for?

229
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,036
I don't know. I don't know.

230
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,746
Okay. Well, look,I'm gonna dive into this,

231
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,457
and then hopefully I can meet up with you later, okay?

232
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,792
Yeah, that sounds good.

233
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,001
Hey, hey. . .

234
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,213
I love you.

235
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:29,881
I love you, too.

236
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,300
Bye.abcBye.

237
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,526
Extraction team is in the air, sir.

238
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,069
They should be on the ground within the hour.

239
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,572
I want that team in and out of the city in less than 1 2 hours.

240
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,990
We're not even supposed to have

241
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,658
a presence in Cape Town. Yes, sir.

242
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,830
Any communications about Frost's whereabouts are strictIy need-to-know.

243
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,674
Sir, the extraction team is en route to the consulate now.

244
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,182
Who's reaching out to 7-R?

245
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,433
Richards, ma'am.

246
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,934
I want the housekeeper briefed.

247
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,020
High-priority target is coming in.I want the house quiet.

248
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,354
Under no circumstances should there be

249
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,023
any communication until the team has left.

250
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,399
Yes, ma'am.

251
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:49,252


252
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,670


253
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,093


254
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,139
Yeah?

255
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,307
Do you have a room?

256
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,642

00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,466
All the way back.

00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,991

Stay with him.Let's go download our gear.

266

00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,144
Down the hall.Just right at the end, there.

269
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,190
Kill all the surveillance cameras in this room.

270
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,084
My name is Daniel Kiefer.

271
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,005
We were at The Farm together.

272
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,009
Technically,you were a year ahead.

273
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm here to make you aware of your rights.

274
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,810
You're being held under a National Security Directive,

275
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,604
which means you have none,but you know that.

276
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,688
Six-hundreds.

277
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,609
The towels,you need six-hundreds.

278
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,196
Those are 350,375-gram weight.

279
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,866
You're gonna need six-hundreds.

280
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,375
I want to know the reasons for you being in Cape Town.

281
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:38,296
I want you to name your resources,contacts, assets,

282
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,798
everybody you've done business with,

283
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,466
traded intel with,sold secrets to,

284
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,260
in the nine years since you betrayed your country.

285
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,306
Absolutely.Anything you want, Daniel.

286
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,649
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed lasted 20 seconds.

287
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,943
They had six-hundreds.

288
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,588
Is this legal?

289
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,098
Bring him down.

290
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,486


291
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,286


292
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,624
Bring him up.

293
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,335


294
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,807
How long was that?

295
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,518


296
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,233
All right,take him down.

302
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,844


303
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,061
Get me a knife.

304
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,480


305
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,483


306
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,902

307
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,162

Go, son.

This ain't a test.This is the real thing.

339
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:34,676
What are you gonna do?

340
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,344
You don't want to try me.

341
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,020
Magazine!abc Let's go.

342
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,605


343
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,898


344
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,945
Velez, stay there!

345
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,947
Listen to me,stay there!

346
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,578
Son of a bitch !

347
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:16,009
Miller!

348
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,886
Hey! Get in here!

349
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,683
Hey, hey. Take these.

350
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,184
Go watch him.

351
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,524


352
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,828
Hey, they're here for me,but they want me alive.

353
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,996
You, they'll kill.

354
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,956


355
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,918
You got one in the chamber?

356
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,046


357
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,174
It's okay.

358
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,094
I remember my first posting.Rio de Janeiro.

359
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,847
A house like this.Beautiful women.

360
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,350
Not one single visitor,but I remember rule number one.

361
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,435
You are responsible for your houseguest.

362
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,519
I'm your houseguest.

363
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,362
The clock is ticking.They gave you the keys.

364
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,488
Do your duty, son.

365
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,199
Shut up. Let me think.

366
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,288
You want to be the guy that lost Tobin Frost?

367
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,421
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

368
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,636


369
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,262


370
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,060


371
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,190


372
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,822
Where's Frost?

373
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,618


374
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,507


375
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,055
We're leaving.

376
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,991
Where is he?

377
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,869


378
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,636
Stay here, stay here!Wait! Don't move!

379
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,308
Hey, hey, hey!

380
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,601


381
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:13,519


382
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,355


383
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:17,899
 Go!

384
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,445
Get in the trunk.

385
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,530
Are you serious?Yeah, get in.

386
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,532
The trunk?Get in the trunk now!

387
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,546


388
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,638


389
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,722
No!

390
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,641


391
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,021


392
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,524


393
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,658


394
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,700
Ops Center.

395
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,994
Echo Three Victor Echo Nine.

396
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,037
Go ahead.

397
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,498
This is Weston.7-R's been hit.Everyone's dead.

398
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,833
I need you to repeat that, pIease.Say again.

399
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:21,045
Kiefer,his team, everyone,they're all dead.

400
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,380
Stand by.

401
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,508
Transferring.

402
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,636
lt's the house.

403
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,764
Linklater. This is Weston.

404
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,307
The safe house has been breached.

405
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,143
What's your location?

406
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,229
I'm eastbound on Albert Road.

407
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,815
I'm just passing woodstock.

408
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,983


409
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,652
I want eyes on this.Real-time sat feed.

410
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,613
LINKLATER: And what's the location of the guest?

411
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,198
We escaped.

412
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,950
Clarify.Do you have the guest?

413
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,326
Yes, we escaped !

414
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,745
Look, I can make it to the consulate.

415
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,080
There's no chance for SDR,

416
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,373
I think I might have picked up a tail.

417
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,667
We can't have a gun battle in front of the consulate.

418
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,211
Diplomatic catastrophe.

419
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,005
Where's that satellite feed?

420
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,215
Denied by National Recon.War theater use only.

421
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,884
Buy us some time.

422
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,014
Do not go to the consulate.

423
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,600
Follow protocol Alpha Zero.

424
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,311
Secure the guest and stay off the grid.

425
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,523
Reconnect at 1800 hours.I repeat, stay off the grid.

426
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,775
Copy, copy, copy.

427
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,068


428
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,695


429
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,669


430
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,604


431
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,953


432
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,592


433
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,327


434
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,379


435
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,181


436
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:23,913


437
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,761
All right,Cape Town police have responded to the house.

438
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,137
Confirmed.abc I want the site secured.

439
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,222
I'm hearing nine dead.

440
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,890
Initiating damage control.

441
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,725
I'm on it.Reaching out to NIA now.

442
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,770
The locals are going to have that house locked off.

443
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,816
Check all the traffic cameras,police reports...

444
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,528
Find out why Frost wanted to go in that consulate to begin with

445
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,196
and who in the hell else might be after him.

446
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,117
We need to get Weston and Frost out of South Africa.

447
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,954
Now, do we have any tactical teams?Anything in play?

448
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,414
Yeah, l have assets in Egypt,but they're in deep.

449
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,834
If I pull them out,that would compromise two years' worth of work.

450
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,460
I can scramble a team from Europe or Asia,

451
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,754
but it's going to take at least 18 hours.

452
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,967
At this point,Weston is all we got.

453
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,932
I need to find out who this Matt Weston is,right now.

454
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,102
Matthew James Weston.

455
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,064
Born 02-24-82 to Terry and Madeline weston

456
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,941

457
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,359
An assault arrest,one month after

458
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,485
both parents and a younger sister

459
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,195
were killed in a traffic accident

460
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,864
in which his father's blood-alcohol

461
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,657
was twice the legal limit.

462
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,327
Yale, degree in Economics,recruited out of Yale law.

463
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,622
High marks in analytics and linguistics at The Farm.

464
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,208
Excellent in tradecraft skills.

465
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:54,336
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,is a French national.

466
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,549
He reported them as having "close and continuing contact."

467
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,510
She's a second year resident in the oncology department at Groote Schuur.

468
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,553
Get in that car.

469
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,763
She accepted a position with Hotel-Dieu Hospital

470
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,515
in Paris,starts in two weeks.

471
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,310
No known political affiliations. She's clean.

472
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,937
I want you to post a car outside their apartment.

473
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,522
Use back channels.

474
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,401
And get NSA to cross-check their telephone records and their e-mails, please.

475
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,485
Yes, ma'am.

476
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,751
FROST: You know, it would be easier if I knew where we were going.

477
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:37,004
You just drive, all right?Just drive, middle lane.

478
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,255
All right.

479
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,426
Hey, what are you doing?Middle lane.

480
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,554
Just drive around.

481
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,765
All right.I'm driving.

482
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,976


483
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,355
Nice to know who you're talking to.What's your name?

484
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,607
You crushed my windpipe.

485
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,692
Well, you locked me in the trunk.

486
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,239
Come on, you're not NOC.You're here under your real name.

487
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:05,282
What is it?

488
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:06,492
Weston, Matt.

489
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,202
All right.

490
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,079
How long you been a safe house keeper?

491
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,121
Twelve months.

492
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,373
Happy birthday.

493
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,458


494
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,002
Cape Town,that's low-level detail.

495
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,755
You should have been out of here by now.

496
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,924
Maybe I requested the assignment.

497
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,092


498
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,595
Or maybe Langley doesn't trust you with anything else.

499
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,141
So, what's your plan?

500
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,228
Oh, let me guess.Follow protocol.

501
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,480
Protocol states that if your house is crashed,

502
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,358
you do an SDR to make sure no one's following you.

503
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:43,654
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag,select another safe house.

504
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,741
You think I'm going to let you just take me in?

505
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,326
I think you need to shut up.

506
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,452
 

507
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,205
I think you need to consider how your house was attacked in the first place.

508
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,290
Have you done that, Matt?

509
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,838
They followed Kiefer.They followed him from the consulate,

510
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,006
and that's how they found the safe house.

511
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,716
Come on, you don't really believe that,do you?

512
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,302
How did they know l was near the consulate in the first place?

513
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,639
Hmm.

514
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,059
But l like this, you know.You and me, figuring shit out.

515
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,062
Like the Hardy Boys.

516
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,191
That house was a secure location.

517
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,609
Whoever crashed it

518
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:26,864
didn't stop by a gas station and ask for directions to the nearest safe house.

519
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,241
They were invited.Someone told them,Matthew.

520
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,577
Think about it.Someone you know.

521
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,413
So you better ask yourself,can you trust your landlord?

522
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,290
Go ahead,you're not going to get in my head.

523
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,834
I already am in your head.

524
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,544
They're going to isolate you, Matt.

525
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,920
They're going to be real nice to you at first.

526
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:44,715
They're going to put their arm around you and tell you things like,

527
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,801
"You did a decent job, son.We'll take it from here."

528
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,303
That's when you know you're screwed.

529
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,389
Forget about me.They're going to focus on you.

530
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,683
They're going to try and make a connection between you and I.

531
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,727
So that if this all goes wrong,

532
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,395
they'll have something to fall back on

533
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,856
in their little Senate hearings.

534
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,695
I'm not your only enemy tonight.

535
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,741
So, it's someone in-house.

536
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,993
It's the only way this thing could've heppen

537
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,703
We were completely buttoned up.

538
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,916
I want a list of everyone who knew about this.

539
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,501
Backgrounds, affiliations,

540
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,212
particularly any connections with Frost.

541
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,839
Every movement right up until this operation.

542
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,550
Your extraction team,how long had they been together?

543
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,471
My team had been together six months.Why?

544
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,432
Well, I'm just trying to get my head around this.

545
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,976
That will do, thank you.

546
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,692


547
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,743


548
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,783


549
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,495


550
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,711
Hello. Hey.

551
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,838
Baby, where are you?

552
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:31,798
I'm all right.I'm okay.

553
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,926
I'm okay.

554
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,430
I'm sorry I didn't call you back,I saw your missed calls.

555
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,182
You must be worried sick.

556
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,516
Is everything okay?

557
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,312
I'm good.I'm good. Listen.

558
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,022
This sounds so crazy.

559
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,524
We had some threats against the clinic last night,

560
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,776
so Parker and I,we stayed all night

561
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,070
trying to get to the bottom of it.

562
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:57,032
And I'm sorry that I didn't call you back.I should have, right away.

563
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,659
I was so worried.

564
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,244
I know.

565
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:06,124
Can you do me a favor?Can you go over to the window for a second?

566
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,334
why?

567
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,836
Can you just take a quick look out the window?

568
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,964
I want you to see if there's anyone out there.

569
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:14,132
Are there any cars that don't belong?

570
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,009
Anyone hanging around out front?

571
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,388
There's a police car.

572
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,599
what's going on?

573
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,684
I'm sorry about this.

574
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:24,977
I know this is a lot,

575
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,645
but we felt like it would be best

576
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,272
if we didn't go home as a precaution,

577
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,314
and I agree with him.

578
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,108
I know there's nothing to worry about,but I agree with him.

579
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,485
I think you should just go to Dena's for a little while,

580
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,405
just for a few hours,and I'll call you in a little bit.

581
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,866
And we'll get together, okay?

582
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,959
Okay, I'll go.

583
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,632
Okay. I love you.I'll talk to you soon,all right?

584
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,051
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

585
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:10,647


586
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,160
She know what you do for a living?

587
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,669
The girl on the phone.It was a girl, wasn't it?

588
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,840
Maybe it was a guy,I don't know.

589
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,133
I don't judge.

590
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:47,184
You can't expect to have a real relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

591
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,104
Don't worry.She's not going to leave you.

592
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:55,025
See, what happens is,you try to protect her with lies,

593
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,693
and then it starts to add up.

594
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,031
At the safe house you said that they'd kill me to get to you.

595
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,574
After a while,even the truth. . .

596
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,910
Why? . . .starts to sound like a lie.

597
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,372
You have something. You got something that they want.What is it?

598
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:09,456
Is she a local?

599
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,540
Don't worry about her.What is it?

600
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,125
Oh, it is a girl.

601
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,558
You'll keep covering your tracks,she'll keep believing.

602
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,770
Because she wants to, because she needs to.

603
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,983
That's why we exist,you and me,that's our job.

604
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,653
To take advantage of that.

605
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,824
People's desire to believe.

606
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,742
To trust.

607
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,754
She's not going to leave you, Matthew.

608
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,467
You're going to leave her.

609
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,600
I'm not you.

610
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,368
Correct, sir.We verified it.

611
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,140


612
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,851
That is your boy.You take it.

613
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,105
Everybody, stand by.

614
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,774
Matty, it's me.

615
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,152
How are you holding up?

616
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:04,571
I'm all right.

617
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,871
Matt, we can't get another team in for at least 1 2 hours.

618
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,373
Sorry.

619
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:19,336
We've cleared a new safe house for you outside the city.

620
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,129
There's a Go-Bag located

621
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,926
at locker number 256,Green Point Stadium Metrorail station.

622
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:30,013
The combination is 2-5-1-22.

623
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,556
2-5-1 -22.

624
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,725
Now, the bag's got a GPS in it.

625
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,268
It'll direct you to the safe house.

626
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,396
But you got to be careful,it's an active location.

627
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,482
So, approach with caution.

628
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,779
Matt?

629
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,992
Do you know how they found Frost?

630
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,452
Do you know who led them to us?

631
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,790
We're working on that.

632
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,584
We're counting on you, Matt.

633
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,462
Get Frost to that safe house and you can write your own ticket.

634
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,594
I will.

635
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,564
Left at the light.

636
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,983
To the stadium?

637
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,276
Yeah.

638
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,323


639
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,743


640
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,759
Hey, scarf.How much for a scarf?

641
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,429
Only fifty rand.

642
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,638
Thanks.

643
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,183
Cuff your hands together.

644
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,351
Together? Yeah.

645
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,362
Out.

646
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,077
Are you sure you don't want to just walk away from this?

647
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,120
Can't do that.

648
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,496
Yes, you can.You should.

649
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,128
Move. Go.Across the street.

650
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,759


651
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,810
Going to the game.I like games.

652
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,228
Metrorail,straight ahead.

653
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,313
Straight ahead.

654
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,407
Right over there.

655
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,714


656
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,679
Let's go.

657
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,686


658
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,538
Help! Help!He's trying to kidnap me!

659
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

660
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,958
He's trying to kidnap me! Help!

661
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,209
He's got a gun !

662
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,336


663
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,547
He's got a gun! He's got a gun right there!

664
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:54,467
I'm undercover.I'm undercover!

665
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,720
Calm down, sir.Everybody, calm down !

666
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:57,804


667
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,433


668
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,565
Get down ! Get down !

669
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,026
All right! Okay!

670
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,323


671
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,336
Get him up. Get up.

672
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,921
Ow, ow, ow!

673
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,846
I'm an American citizen.I don't know what he wanted from me.

674
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,016
Just calm down.

675
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,476


676
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,369


677
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,585
Hey, hey, hey.I'm a police officer.I'm from America.

678
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,046
I arrested this man.His name is Tobin Frost.

679
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,297
Where did you take him?

680
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,216
He's in the infirmary.

681
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,431
There, there! Is that it?

682
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:27,393
Top left,second screen from the top! Look, look, the infirmary.

683
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,148
Right. Go back.

684
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,202
Third-tier infirmary,now! Move!

685
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,246
Third-tier infirmary.Go, now!

686
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,207
Do you see?

687
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,381


688
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:00,927


689
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,057


690
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,776


691
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,575
Don't move.

692
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,826


693
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,341


694
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,149


695
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,329


696
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:46,407
Frost!

697
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,659
Hey!

698
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:48,952


699
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,662
Stop! Stop!

700
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,040
Get out the way!

701
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,375
Stop!

702
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,044


703
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,424
No! Stop!

704
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:12,725


705
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,234
Medic!

706
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,261
Drop the gun.

707
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,179
Drop it.

708
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,098
I'm responsible for you.

709
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,516


710
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,103
You're responsible for yourself.

711
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,442
Get on your knees.

712
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,830
Are you going to kill me?

713
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,756


714
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,886
I only kill professionals.

715
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:34,849


716
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,365
Height,approximateIy six feet.

717
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,077
Anglo, wearing a stadium security jacket.

718
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,413
The suspect was last seen entering Green Point Stadium Metrorail,

719
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,624
stadium concourse.

720
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,261
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost might be doing in Cape Town.

721
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,807
Can you bring up. . .

722
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,769
Alec Wade.Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.

723
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,106
Sabotage, counter-ambush,counter-IED tactics,

724
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,233
until he blew up an op in Lisbon four years ago

725
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,776
and was put on a desk,pushing papers.

726
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,112
Cape Town Police found him shot through the head,

727
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,031
high-powered rifle,1 4 blocks from the consulate.

728
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,450
Witnesses placed someone fitting Frost's description

729
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:35,993
in the car at the time of the shooting.

730
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,454
And we think, what?That they were working together?

731
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,457
They ran joint operations in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

732
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:44,669
Frost's last sighting was in Hamburg, 201 1 .

733
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,130
And what are the Brits saying about Wade?

734
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,965
Officially,they're saying nothing.

735
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,091
Unofficially?

736
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,426
He's been the subject of a five-month internal investigation.

737
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,178
They think he's been trading intel.

738
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,304
Hmm.

739
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,473
So what the hell did Wade leak to Frost

740
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,726
that was so important it was worth killing six of our men?

741
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:07,817
I want more details from MI6.Call in every chit you got.

742
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,943
Yes, sir.

743
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,320
David, I want an internal investigation

744
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,115
into Daniel Kiefer and his team.

745
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,901


746
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,738


747
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,286
I've got Weston calling in for David Barlow.

748
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,583
I lost him.

749
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,043
Frost?

750
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,419
Yeah, he's gone.

751
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,963
After I picked up the GPS,he created a diversion,

752
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,715
took out a couple of cops at the stadium.

753
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,175
BARLOW: Any idea where he's headed?

754
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,635
Not exactly,but I will.

755
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,054
This is Linklater.You said he took out two cops?

756
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,847
Matt, you're on speaker.

757
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,310
Yes, ma'am.At the Green Point Stadium.

758
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,729
involvement in a possibIe kidnapping.

759
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,774
The suspect is being described as a white male of medium build.

760
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:32,151
Stadium police is reporting you shot a cop.

761
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,320
I returned fire in self-defense.

762
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,323
The fact of the matter is,Frost is on the loose.

763
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,408
I've spent the last 1 4 hours with him.

764
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,827
He might have said or done something that could lead me to him.

765
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,581
You are to stand down,proceed to the consulate,

766
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,959
and present yourself for exfil and debrief.Acknowledge.

767
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,461
By the time I'm debriefed,Frost will be gone.

768
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,046
I've spent 12 months researching

769
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,297
every square inch of this town.

770
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,092
I will find Frost and I'll deliver him.

771
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,594
Weston, this is Harlan Whitford, son.

772
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,184
Now, you've done a fine job,but we'll take it from here.

773
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,191
Understood.

774
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,370


775
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,206


776
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,297
Hello.

777
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,798
Sir, I respectfully request that,

778
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,216
that exchange not make it onto his files.

779
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,760
He's either incompetent or he's working with somebody else.

780
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,345
Do not make this about Weston.

781
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,888
It was your guys that lost Frost.

782
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,640
It was your team that folded at the safe house.

783
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,893
I want both of you on an airplane to Cape Town.

784
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,565
Frost is trying to get out of the country.Go find his ass.

785
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,432
There you go, baby.

786
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,273
One ticket to Jo'burg.

787
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,575
Thank you.

788
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,329


789
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,519


790
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,815


791
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,483


792
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:23,322
Police had detained American NGO worker Matthew Weston

793
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:26,158
as a possible suspect in the shooting.

794
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,869
Weston had been detained earlier today,

795
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:33,541
but managed to escape while being questioned by stadium security officials

796
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,210
about his involvement in the shootings.

797
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,880
The suspect has been described as a white male of medium build,

798
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,175
possibly wearing a stadium security outfit.

799
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,098
Baby.

800
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,893

I don't do anything.

810

Sir. Someone just logged into our system using Weston's password

839
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,064
accessing his stored files.

840
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,901
it's him.What the hell is he doing?

841
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,944
I'm not sure.

842
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,237
I want to see what he's looking at.

843
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:37,618
He's pulled an old report

844
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:41,038
on surveillance targets living in the Langa Township area.

845
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,919
It's a profiIe of Carlos Villar,a Nicaraguan national.

846
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:49,213
He's a known document forger.

847
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,173
Get me a copy of Weston's report.

848
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,299
Yes, sir.

849
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,134
Logged off, sir.He's gone.

850
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,387
An Internet cafe on Long Street.

851
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,115


852
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,332
Like a black Dorian Gray.

853
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,501
That's right.How you doing, brother?

854
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,669


855
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,170
Come in. Yes, sir.

856
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,677
Illana?

857
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,470
Hi.

858
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,055
We have a guest.

859
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,473


860
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,392
Illana.Good to meet you.

861
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,060
Joseph, my daughter.

862
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,438
How are you? Hello.

863
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,522
My son-in-law.

864
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,316


865
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,943
May I offer you some tea?

866
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,195
No, we're going upstairs.

867
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,655
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

868
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,334
I remembered.

869
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,880
You even let it breathe.

870
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,555
"Too long a sacrifice Can make a stone of the heart

871
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:26,894
"O when may it suffice?

872
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,189
"That is Heaven's part"

873
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,820
In the old days,a cheap bottle

874
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,947
of Flor de Cana kept us happy all night.

875
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,533
Mmm. Tastes change.

876
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,080
People change.

877
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:54,171
People don't change.

878
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,174
We grow old.

879
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,676
And some of us adapt.

880
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,555
And learn how to enjoy simple pleasures of life,

881
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,768
like a family, a home.

882
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,187
And for you. . .

883
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,981
What's in that glass right now, for you,

884
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,442
is as good as it's ever going to be.

885
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:21,156
One day you'll understand.

886
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,785
You got more past than future, you learn.

887
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,539
What is this? An intervention?

888
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,249


889
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,338
I thought you were dead.

890
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,355
So, what brings you to my home in the middle of the night

891
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,898
after all these years?

892
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:10,664
Ooh.

893
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:17,796
Papa?

894
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,339
Uh-huh.

895
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,799
We're going.

896
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:22,384
Okay, be careful.

897
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,969
Okay, Papa.

898
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,532
What are you going to do with this?

899
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,410
Make some money.

900
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,786
Let me borrow your glasses.

901
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:58,587
That's it. Listen.

902
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:03,175
I'm going to need a new passport,photo lD, driver's license,

903
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,802
the whole shebang.Can you do that for me?

904
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,055
Yeah.

905
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,141
You sure?

906
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,393
Yes.

907
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,736
Weston never showed at the consulate.

908
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,238
And he was just accessing our secure server,

909
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,116
searching for someone to create an alias package.

910
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,663
He's trying to leave the country.

911
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,873
Or he's going after Frost.

912
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,210
Look at what happened at the soccer stadium.

913
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,754
This guy let Frost escape.

914
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,968
I think Weston's turned.

915
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,636
I know this boy.

916
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,223
He's been Iooking for a chance to prove himseIf.

917
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,558
He's trying to bring in Frost.

918
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:56,687
Come on, David.

919
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,855
You're not seeing the evidence.

920
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:10,575


921
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,244
Not my best work.

922
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,747
But given the pressure of time, it's passable.

923
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,916
It's good.I'll wire you the money

924
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,418
as soon as I get out of town.

925
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:24,089
Tobin, don't do this.It's different.

926
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,551
You don't need the trouble, you don't need the money.

927
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,469
You can give it. . .

928
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,311


929
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:50,574
Carlos!

930
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,075
Illana!

931
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,410
Carlos!

932
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:54,619
Illana!

933
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,747


934
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,916
Carlos.

935
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,003
Carlos!

936
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,047


937
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:15,474
Go.

938
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,641


939
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,321
He's on the roof!

940
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,948


941
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,225


942
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:01,269
(SPEAKING AFRIKAANS)

943
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:30,924
Go! Go!

944
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:34,761


945
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,401


946
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,074


947
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:14,759


948
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,094


949
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:44,289


950
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:58,470
Get in the car!

951
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,669
They think they can come at me like this.

952
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,587
Have to do it a whole lot better than that.

953
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,507


954
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,552
Shit!

955
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:54,651
Matt, how'd you find me?

956
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,736
It wasn't that hard.

957
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:57,862


958
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,290


959
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,042


960
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:15,380
Let's go.

961
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:21,553


962
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,867
Wait, wait, wait.

963
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:37,253


964
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:45,428


965
01:18:45,513 --> 01:18:46,638


966
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,141


967
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:05,824


968
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:08,410


969
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:13,206


970
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:25,969


971
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:49,868


972
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,374


973
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:58,960
Who do you work for?

974
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,063
Who sent you?

975
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,693
Who sent you? Who sent you?

976
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,321
Who?

977
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,282
Vargas.

978
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,410
Who's Vargas?

979
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,707
You want to die?

980
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,627


981
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:43,254
Who's Vargas?

982
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:48,718
Matt.

983
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:57,644
CIA.

984
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,982
CIA! CIA!

985
01:21:15,246 --> 01:21:16,454


986
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,555
Report?

987
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,473
There was a shootout in the Langa Township.

988
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,102
Two crime scenes.One at the residence of Carlos Villar.

989
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,728
He's a document forger.

990
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,397
The other in a nearby tenement.

991
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:43,606
And where was Frost last seen?

992
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:44,816
Tenement.

993
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:46,818
Have fun at Villar's.

994
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,486
We'll meet up later.

995
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,717
You were right about Ana.

996
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,429
That's her name.

997
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:18,391
Sorry to hear that.

998
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:25,398
Most case officers get married three,four times.

999
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,193
You?

1000
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:30,903


1001
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,531
Once.

1002
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,329


1003
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,914


1004
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,712
You're falling apart over here.

1005
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,422


1006
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:55,094


1007
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,222
Don't kill innocent people,Matthew.

1008
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,143
What?

1009
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:12,654
Air traffic controller,a tiny airstrip in Bermuda.

1010
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:16,240
George Edwart Cox,I remember that name.

1011
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,201
Edwart, with a "T."

1012
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:24,082
My inside officer said he was organizing arms shipments,

1013
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:27,960
but he was just an air traffic controller.He was just a guy.

1014
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,713
I put a bullet in his skull.

1015
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:37,136
Black Ops came in,they replaced him with one of their own,

1016
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,514
and crashed a Gulfstream in the ocean that night.

1017
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:43,309
The thing was,the family that was on the plane. . .

1018
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,814
The husband,he was a whistleblower.

1019
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,693
The whole thing was about

1020
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,321
stopping him from testifying about wet works

1021
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,574
to a congressional hearing.

1022
01:24:01,787 --> 01:24:03,413
Is that why you left?

1023
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:04,664
No.

1024
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:05,957


1025
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:10,420
I went back to work the next day like nothing ever happened.

1026
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:16,551
You practice anything a long time,you get good at it.

1027
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:20,221
You tell a hundred lies a day,it sounds like the truth.

1028
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,640
Everyone betrays everyone.

1029
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:27,729
That's a shitty excuse.

1030
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,442
Yeah, I used to be innocent like you.

1031
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:35,319
Wrap myself up in the flag. . .

1032
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:44,662
I'm going to take you in.

1033
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:54,839
Good for you.

1034
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:48,893


1035
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:50,144
Barlow.

1036
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,104
Witnesses identified a pair of men

1037
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:53,981
fitting weston and Frost's description

1038
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,108
leaving this location together.

1039
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,485
So, he pulled it off.

1040
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,446
Weston is aiding and abetting a fugitive.

1041
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:01,948
You're wrong.

1042
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,617
If he's with Frost,he's taking him to the safe house.

1043
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,494
That's where we got to be.

1044
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,538
Fine. Fine.

1045
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,415
Meet me at the crossroads at Old Malmesbury Road.

1046
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,149


1047
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:39,861
 Who are you?

1048
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:41,988
You Weston?

1049
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,241
Give me the shotgun.

1050
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,909
What the hell is this?

1051
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:48,077
Who are you?

1052

01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:08,973
To the left.

1056
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:12,852
Slowly.

1057
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,563
l don't know who trained you, man,but this sure as hell

1058
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,398
ain't protocol.Where's the guest room?

1059
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,484
That's the thing,we don't really have one.

1060
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:24,447
ln there. ln there.

1061
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:31,162
Cuff him.To the pipe.

1062
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:39,962
Out. Over there.

1063
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:41,881
All right.

1064
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:45,509
Control room.

1065
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,680
Whatever you say, man.lt's your rodeo.

1066
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,099


1067
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,568
Call it in.Let me hear it.

1068
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:10,493


1069
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,788
LandIord.

1070
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:15,915
My guest is here.

1071
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,041
Account?

1072
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,334
Abaresque Limited.

1073
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:21,087
with a guest?

1074
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,338
Yeah, package delivered.

Confirmed.Pickup scheduIed.

1076
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,470
They're on the way.

1077
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,392
Can we at least put the gun down now?

1078
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:45,277
Thanks, Clayton. Bye.

1079
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:48,906
lt's a microchip.

1080
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,741
What?

1081
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,868
That was my guy from Ml6.

1082
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,412
Wade got his hands on a microchip.

1083
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:55,746
And what was on it?

1084
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,039
Only Wade knew,

1085
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:58,499
but l think it's safe to assume

1086
01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,667
that's why he hooked up with Frost.

1087
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,252
To sell it.

1088
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:03,921
Let's get moving.

1089
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,590


1090
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:20,021


1091
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,033


1092
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,456
Long day, huh?

1093
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:47,173
l can only imagine.Tobin Frost.

1094
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,426
That man's a legend.

1095
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:52,720
l hope you picked up something.

1096
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,097
You ain't going to find a better education.

1097
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,390


1098
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,318
This is the most excitement l've seen.

1099
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,904
You're the first guest l've had in 1 0 months.

1100
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,948
But you wouldn't know anything about that, right?

1101
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,825
You got a city posting.

1102
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,913
Yeah, nightlife, beaches.

1103
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:21,665
Little ladies running around everywhere.

1104
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,211
Yeah.

1105
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,006
l'm jealous.

1106
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,639
You got coffee?

1107
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,390
Yeah, it's in the cupboard.

1108
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:39,517
Where?

1109
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,560
Want me to get it? l got it.

1110
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:43,479


1111
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,026


1112
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:54,740


1113
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:22,935


1114
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:29,859


1115
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:09,565


1116
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:10,900


1117
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,370


1118
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,354


1119
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:11,043


1120
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,686


1121
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,248


1122
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:03,178
Why are you in Cape Town?

1123
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:08,767
Tell me now. Why?

1124
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,234
What is it?

1125
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:20,529
A dirt list,laundry list.

1126
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:24,783
lsraeli lntelligence,five years ago,compiled blackmail intel.

1127
01:34:25,744 --> 01:34:29,788
Corrupt agents,German lntelligence, Ml6. . .

1128
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:30,914
ClA?

1129
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,708
Yes.

1130
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,544
We got to get away.

1131
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,298
We got to get out of here.

1132
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:40,591


1133
01:34:45,347 --> 01:34:46,347


1134
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,099
Ah, shit.

1135
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:07,868
Don't, don't, don't.

1136
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:17,169
No, don't leave me here,please.

1137
01:35:17,295 --> 01:35:18,879
Don't do it.

1138
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:27,805


1139
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,092
Matt?

1140
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:09,388
Hey.

1141
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,684
How you doing?

1142
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,525
I'm proud of you.

1143
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,613
And what you pulled off.

1144
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:32,453
You're going to make a hell of a case officer.

1145
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,248
Where's Frost?

1146
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:37,958
He's gone.

1147
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:45,132
Place is a wreck.Blood everywhere.

1148
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,593
Was he injured or. . .

1149
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,433
I guess you know he killed Keller.

1150
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,560
No.

1151
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,355
I killed Keller.

1152
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,074
Frost killed Keller.

1153
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,454
He killed Linklater, too.

1154
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:22,503
Did he talk about anything? Anything he was after?

1155
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,589
Anything he might have had?

1156
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,258
The file.

1157
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:30,552
The file?

1158
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:34,181
The file that you're on.

1159
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,271
Along with a lot of other people.

1160
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,106
Important people.

1161
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:53,700


1162
01:37:55,453 --> 01:37:56,453
Listen to me.

1163
01:37:57,413 --> 01:37:59,665
What would you do

1164
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:02,376
if someone is watching your every move?

1165
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:06,421
Some maybe you're not proud of.

1166
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,967
And you will have some you're not proud of,believe me.

1167
01:38:10,051 --> 01:38:12,594
And then tries to use it against you?

1168
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:20,644
You would do what you have to do.

1169
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:27,192


1170
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:29,236
Where's the file?

1171
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:32,614


1172
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,577


1173
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:40,080
Matt, the file.Where is the file?

1174
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,126
You're a dead man.

1175
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:46,461
Yeah, a long time now.

1176
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:48,380
Frost is here.

1177
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:34,885


1178
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:57,282


1179
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:05,165


1180
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:52,504
Let's go.

1181
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:55,507


1182
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:12,190


1183
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:17,028
We got him.

1184
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:20,490
A hell of a job.

1185
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:57,360
You smell that?

1186
01:41:57,904 --> 01:42:00,614
Pinotage.It's a good grape.Great wine.

1187
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:04,743
Local grape.Pinotage is great. . .

1188
01:42:12,418 --> 01:42:14,836
I don't want you losing this one.

1189
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:18,298
It's worth a lot of money.

1190
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,510


1191
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:24,054
You're a good boy,Matty.

1192
01:42:26,432 --> 01:42:28,099
You know what you are.

1193
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:31,394


1194
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:32,813
Hey.

1195
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,732
I know what you're not.

1196
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,072
You're better than me.

1197
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:50,622
No, it's okay,just be better than me.

1198
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,087
You promise me.

1199
01:42:58,506 --> 01:42:59,756
Yeah.

1200
01:43:05,388 --> 01:43:07,681
Well, let's. . .

1201
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,726
Let's go.

1202
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:16,606
I just got to get up.I need to get up.

1203
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:23,864
Stay.

1204
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:28,201
Hey. . .

1205
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:48,114
That's exactly as it happened.

1206
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,496
Obviously,this situation needs

1207
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,831
to be handled with a certain amount of finesse.

1208
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,959
Has anybody else seen this report?

1209
01:44:59,043 --> 01:45:00,961
No, sir. Not yet.

1210
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,922
Matt, I'm sure this comes as no surprise,

1211
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:08,635
but parts of this report are going to have to be altered for national security.

1212
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:11,388
Which parts, sir?

1213
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:12,889
Well. . .

1214
01:45:13,474 --> 01:45:15,517
David Barlow can't be held responsible

1215
01:45:15,601 --> 01:45:17,477
for what happened to the safe house.

1216
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,897
We just don't need the scandal.

1217
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:23,483
But, sir,you and I both know that,that is just not the truth.

1218
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:26,152
People don't want the truth anymore, Matt.

1219
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:29,114
It's too messy.Keeps them up nights.

1220
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:35,662
I'll tell you what I am willing to do, though.

1221
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:39,582
I think the Agency has grossly underestimated you,

1222
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,795
and I'm recommending you for a senior case officer position.

1223
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,380
Provided you still want it.

1224
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:48,925
That's a generous offer, sir.

1225
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:53,763
There's just one thing you need to clarify for me.

1226
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:55,140
Of course.

1227
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:59,227
Frost may have been carrying some vital intel.

1228
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:00,645
A file.

1229
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:04,107
I'm not seeing that anywhere in this report.

1230
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:13,324
What was on the file, sir?

1231
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:16,119
Something that,quite frankly,could be very damaging

1232
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:18,538
to the Agency and to our allies.

1233
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:25,837
I don't see why Frost would even mention something like that to me.

1234
01:46:31,093 --> 01:46:33,511
No, I suppose he wouldn't,would he?

1235
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:41,144
You realize, though,that if that file did leak,

1236
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:44,814
what would happen to the person responsible?

1237
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,900
That person would be arrested, sir.

1238
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:48,818
He'd be risking everything.

1239
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,656
He'd have enemies in every intelligence agency in the world.

1240
01:46:55,284 --> 01:46:58,828
In the eyes of the CIA,he'd be just like Tobin Frost.

1241
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:05,585
Frost didn't say anything about a file, sir.

1242
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,175
All right, son.

1243
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:14,886
Take a few days off.

1244
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,930
We'll get you started next week.

1245
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:20,100
Thank you.

1246
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:25,271
And think about our conversation,would you?

1247
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:27,023
Will do.

1248
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:29,067
I'll take it from here, sir.

1249
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:55,927
and other media outlets

1250
01:47:56,011 --> 01:47:58,847
received a controversial file from an anonymous source.

1251
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,807
The international intelligence community is still reeling

1252
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:03,893
from the release of so many highly classified documents

1253
01:48:03,978 --> 01:48:07,480
and the revelations of widespread corruption and criminaI activity

1254
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:08,565
at the CIA,the BND, and MI6.

1255
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:09,774
is in an uproar over the Iack

1256
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:11,734
of oversight given to British Intelligence,

1257
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:14,154
demanding accountabiIity of the rogue agents.

1258
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:15,989
Officials at Ml6 are fully cooperating.

1259
01:48:16,073 --> 01:48:17,615
Chancellor Merkel insists that the BND

1260
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,534
has already identified the corrupt agents

1261
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:21,411
and contained the intelligence breach.

1262
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,079
She has ensured her internationaI counterparts...

1263
01:48:23,164 --> 01:48:25,165
Indictments are now expected within the week,

1264
01:48:25,249 --> 01:48:27,792
and Congress has demanded that Deputy Director Harlan Whitford

1265
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:29,794
testify before a Senate subcommittee

1266
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:31,546
in an effort to determine how many peopIe

1267
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,423
at the CIA are involved in this

1268
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:37,260
and just how far up the corruption reaches.

1269
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:46,371


1270
01:53:41,815 --> 01:53:43,941
