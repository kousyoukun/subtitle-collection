I know that ignorance

And that's the way of the world.

Where'd she get that then?

Of

We must do what is right.

Perhaps

Ҳ������˹�ж�����ʽ������ʱ��

Of course,

then we won't tell Mrs. Worrall.

Your arms, here, have a look.

00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,345
- It seems she don't like men.

397
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,972

you're a woman.
������Ů�ˣ���������

don't have any.

- That is only her arms.
�ڸ첲�ϴ���

400
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,363

Ұ���˻�����ʲô�ط����������������˹����

You hold her arms,

But I was wrong about her.

413
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,876
- You print the works of Mr.
Coleridge.
������ӡ����֥��������Ʒ

00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,713
A poet of great imagination.

imagination does not run

to paying his last two bills.

Have you got something for me?

00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,803
- I find out something.
�ҷ�����һЩ

00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:44,521
She bite me, she
bite me so hard.
��ҧ���ң����˺ܴ�ľ�

I know this is not the

��֪���ⲻ��һ������Ů�˻�ҧ��

421
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:53,197
And now I have no more doubt,
only a savage would do this.
���ڣ���ȷ������һ��Ұ��Ů��

422
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:59,536

it's not proof, Frixos.
�ҵ��ϵۣ������ڻ�û��֤�ݣ������˹

423
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,372

���ڿ������̫ƽ���μ��п�����

The peoples have the

She had this same tattoo.

- Really, that is interesting.
��ģ��⵹�Ǻ���Ȥ

428
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,885
- I have seen it on her leg.
���������Ͽ�����

429
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:20,473
She had very beautiful
leg for a savage.
��Ϊһ��Ұ���ˣ������Ⱥ�Ư��

430
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,069

there should be

431
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,320
an opportunity for profit.
����ռ�

432
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,448
Look at Baggers who took
the salon trade
������һ��ɳ�����װ����

433
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,200

built himself a palace.
��������Լ�ӵ�е�һ�ҵ���

00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,412

be pleased to grant you

favorable conditions

I saved you from the poorhouse.

�㣬�ҵľ�ʿ�����������׽�����

Well find out who did

��һ�£�˭�ɵģ�Ȼ�󿪳����ǡ�

443
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,642
It's an heirloom.

What's
she a" about?

445
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:09,981
- Caraboo.

446
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,860

saying she did it.
����Ϊ������˵�������ɵ�

447
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:23,866
Caraboo.

00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,209
Hell's bells.

Worrall.
����һλ��Ʒζ���ٲ��ߣ����ն�����

451
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,010
- You must bring her to Bath.
��Ҫ����ȥ��˹

452
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,763
We could present her at

����ҪΪ���ٰ�һ����ᣬ��ױ���

453
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,352

454
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,979
the sensation she would cause.

00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,814
It might be a little
overwhelming just yet,

00:35:57,696 --> 00:35:58,822
The

00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,990
not a little interest
in the piano.
���ٲ����ر����Ȥ

461
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,118

it would please the princess.

What is it, Frixos?
����ʲô�������˹

466
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,215

���̴��

471
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,687

stately pleasure dome decree.
�����Һ����й���һ����ΰ�����ɣ�Բ��������

472
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,356

Oh my God.

00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,449
I suppose our

I hate
musical evenings, always have.

Isn't that right, Frixos?

00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,780

diplomatic aspect.
��Ҳ���⽻�����Ӧ��

481
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,282
We could use an ally
off the Javanese coast

482
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,452

483
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,873
it would not go
unnoticed at Court.
�ⲻ�᲻�ڹ�͢������ע��

00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,043
A knighthood at least, a

485
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:36,627
if I could influence
the outcome.

�ҿ϶���������ն����˸е��ܸ���

No, no stop, please

Of course she'll die of boredom.

I'm going to be so rich.

I cannot comment on it,

an elaborate deception.

Judging by
these your first instinct
�㿿��Щ�ó��ĵ�һֱ��

525
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:00,790

But at least she is an

You should get them pulled.

Thank you.

779
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,605
I look upon it as a duty
to take them in.

01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,734

asking these questions?
�ҿ�������ΪʲôҪ����Щ������

782
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:15,819
- Mr. Gutch is writing an
article for his newspaper

never a prostitute.
Ŷ����λ�����Ͳ��Ǽ�Ů

789
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,502
In fact, when Harrison
asked her how long

790
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,545

792
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,506
She was a simple girl.

Was she beautiful?

never thought so.
Ư���������ҴӲ���Ϊ��Ư��

796
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,604
But men often have such
different views.
�����������в�ͬ���ӽǡ�

797
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,482
You wouldn't describe

800
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,822

I'll give you her address,

803
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:10,040
for yourself if you agree
with my husband

804
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,000
on the question of
her good looks.

805
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,254

01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,838
Here's the piece on the ball.

906
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,340

thought you said

907
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,717
you'd be a longer piece.
Ӧ��д�ɳ�ƪ����

908
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,635

longer version.
�Ҿ������ó�ƪ����

909
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,734

honor by Lord and Lady Apthorpe
�����ڰ������վ�ʿ�ͷ���Ϊ

910
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:12,234

914
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:28,959
appeared to be the Prince

We are hoping that your
recent presentation

01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,194

doubt about it.

that is perjury.
�����ģ������ѣ�����α֤

942

Don't we Sam?

Oh yes I can.

We do have a moral

Of

It wasn't nothing difficult.
��һ�㶼����
