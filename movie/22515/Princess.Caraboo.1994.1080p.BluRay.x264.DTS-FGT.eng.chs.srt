My boyhood imaginings

ÇÇÖÎ£¬ÇëÄãÃÇ¶¼»Ø¼Ò°É

31
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,037
- The villagers are
after the five shillings

32
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,164
for reporting a vagrant but

33
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,293
she doesn't look like a
beggar to me, Mr. Hunt.

34
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:21,843
- George do get about
your business.

35
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,304
She's not a
fairground attraction.

36
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,098
- A foreigner?

37
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,432
- Yes, but she's not French

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,309
so you don't need to be alarmed.

39
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,771
- Maybe she's not French Vicar
but what if she's a Corsican?

40
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,483
- I can assure you she's
not, and I can speak French

41
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,861
personally, and in
Corsica they speak French

42
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,654
or possibly Italian.

43
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,864
Italian,
I had no idea.

44
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,243
I happen to
believe she is a Turk.

45
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:49,120
Vicar, we had
a Portuguese servant girl

46
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,915
during the Spanish
campaign and she

47
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,042
turned out to be a man.

48
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,502
- And what has such a
story to do with

49
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,588
this unfortunate young girl?

50
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,342
- He was a French spy.

51
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,385
- She's obviously female.

52
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,185
For God's sake
man, you're not in Spain now.

53
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,854
More's the pity.

54
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:15,730
- I'm very sorry my dear.

55
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,862
I'm very sorry, I'll take
you somewhere more civilized.

56
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,293
Whoa, thank you Valjet,
will you wait for me please?

57
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:37,294
- Yes sir.

58
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:38,295
- Come along my dear.

59
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,303
Big house but very
ordinary people.

60
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,483
I think you might
have a gift for it ma'am.

61
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,735
- Yes I think I'm getting
a little more skillful.

62
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,445
- Yes ma'am, really truly.

63
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,822
- Ma'am, Vicar's here,
he's brought somebody.

64
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,343
- Mr. Worrall has
gone to Bristol.

65
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:29,220
He won't be back until tomorrow.

66
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:31,306
- Well I had hoped that--

67
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,600
- What makes you think
she's Turkish?

68
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,103
- Her hat, madam.
- Oh.

69
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:41,566
- Caraboo.

70
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,949
- Caraboo, is that her name?

71
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,409
- I haven't heard her
utter the word before.

72
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,161
You, Caraboo?

73
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,582
- Caraboo.

74
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,379
- Worrall, Worrall, I am Mrs.
Worrall.

75
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,684
- Worrall, Worrall.

76
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,941
- Ella, have Mr. Frixos
attend me in the drawing room.

77
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,653
Hurry along.

78
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:46,339
- She not Greek, she
not Turkish.

79
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,093
I would know if she is Turkish
and she definitely not Greek.

80
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,553
- Well perhaps you could
ask her something

81
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,555
in your language, Mr. Frixos.

82
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,182
- Perhaps Mr. Hunt will take
her back where he find her.

83
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,478
- Frixos, ask her
something please.

84
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,230
Yes madam.

85
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,674
- Do you speak any other
foreign language?

86
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,053
- Only English.

87
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,264
- Is it her turban
that makes her

88
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,433
look so foreign, do you think?

89
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,227
Perhaps it is.

90
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,895
My dear,
Caraboo.

91
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:21,184
- Madam she is gypsy, I
throw her out.

92
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,066
- I'm not so sure.

93
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,740
Frixos, take her down
to the servant's hall

94
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,744
and make sure that she
gets some food and a bed.

95
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,536
- Yes madam.

96
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,539
So have you
got a name then?

97
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,873
- Leave her be.

98
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,710
- Cat's got her tongue?

99
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:52,340
- Hey.

100
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,635
- Don't you like meat then?

101
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,849
She saying
she loves your cooking

102
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,183
Mrs. Wilberforce.

103
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,354
- I don't trust her.

104
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,860
Mrs. Worrall, I a little
anxious what Mr. Worrall say

105
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,569
when he come home.

106
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,240
- Oh Frixos, what Mr.
Worrall has to say

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,825
should be of no
concern of yours.

108
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,536
- Yes ma'am.

109
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,260
- Sweet dreams.

110
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:03,115
- God almighty, I need a shot.

111
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,918
Frixos, get me a drink.

112
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,544
Frixos!
- Coming sir.

113
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,094
Good morning sir, sir.

114
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,313
- What the hell is that?

115
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:37,654
- That is a bust of
Homer on the table

116
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:40,573
designed by Chippendale,
the marble come from

117
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,742
a quarry in Carraba, Italy.

118
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,454
- Don't you bloody well
patronize me, Frixos

119
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,789
especially not at this
hour of the morning.

120
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:48,873
Who is it?

121
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,210
- Oh, that is a filthy beggar.

122
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,755
- A beggar?
- Yes sir.

123
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,759
Mrs. Worrall take her
in last night.

124
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,802
You know the story of the
Good Samaritan?

125
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,388
- A beggar?
- Yes sir.

126
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,515
- Oh.

127
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,396
- The poor were
rioting last night.

128
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,689
The goons were called in
to restore order.

129
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,234
Seven dead, I couldn't get back.

130
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,903
- Oh, that's terrible dear.

131
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,487
- There were beggars
sleeping in the doorway

132
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,531
to Tulsey's bank, I
come home and find

133
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,866
you've got beggars
sleeping under my roof.

134
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,286
- Our roof Mr. Worrall,
I paid for it.

135
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:30,623
And she's not a beggar dear,
she's a stranger in need.

136
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,585
- We're all in need,
I've sent her to Bristol.

137
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,128
- You've done what?

138
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,756
I've sent her
to the assizers in Bristol.

139
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,558
Does she
have any property

140
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:50,726
other than the
clothes on her back?

141
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,729
- A bundle containing a
change of linen

142
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,815
and a piece of soap, your
worship sailor's marlin

143
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,025
spike and an apple sir.

144
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:02,322
- What is your name?

145
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,781
What is your name?

146
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,286
And she has no money.

147
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,873
- These coins sir, foreign
coins, but not a penny sir.

148
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:15,042
- All persons or foreigners
going from door to door

149
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,378
and placing themselves
in the streets to beg

150
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,714
are to be deemed idle
and disorderly.

151
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,341
Three months in a house
of detention.

152
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:27,555
- Sir, I've seen one of the
prisoners talking with her sir.

153
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,306
- You have?

154
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,644
Bring him in.

155
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,325
Do you
know this woman?

156
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:49,494
- No sir.

157
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,081
I've seen him
jabbering with her sir.

158
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,667
- No, no, no, no sir,
she's just been teaching me

159
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,711
a few words of her language.

160
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,256
- And what is that?

161
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,299
I don't know, sir.

162
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,634
- Where did she come from?

163
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:08,304
- I don't know that either.

164
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,223
Weâ€œ ask her
what she means by going

165
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,225
from door to door in
Almondsbury?

166
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,412
Caraboo.

167
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,755
- Worrall.
- Worrall.

168
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,299
- Mrs Worrall, you fool.

169
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:51,385
Oh.

170
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,108
- What is she saying?

171
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,734
- I think she's saying
something about a

172
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,032
I know it sounds stupid but
I think that she's saying

173
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:13,532
that her father is a, is a,
is a king.

174
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,130
- Are you mocking this court,
McCarthy?

175
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,675
- I don't believe it either.

176
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,928
- Mr. Haythorne, may I
inquire as to

177
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:32,347
the correct spelling of?

178
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,187
Bloody
journalists.

179
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:42,648
- Mr. Haythorne, may I
approach the bench?

180
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,243
- Well I wouldn't believe
a word that comes out

181
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,664
of this Irish wretch's
mouth or hers, king.

182
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,332
- She's obviously a foreigner.

183
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,752
I know that ignorance
of the law is no defense

184
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:05,337
but how would she know
that to ask for food

185
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:07,840
was a criminal act,
well she wouldn't.

186
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,926
Besides, the Vicar says
she wasn't begging.

187
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,221
I implore you, Mr. Haythorne.

188
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,891
- I've placed this girl
under the supervision

189
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,019
of Mrs. Worrall until more
can be learned of her origins.

190
00:16:20,687 --> 00:16:24,023
McCarthy, three months in the
house of detention, vagrancy.

191
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,282
- Mrs. Worrall, Gutch, Felix
Farley's Bristol Journal.

192
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,242
- Oh, so you're Mr. Gutch.

193
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,826
I've been wondering what
manner of a man

194
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,954
has been writing such scurrilous
things about my husband.

195
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,164
- I would be most grateful
for an opportunity

196
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,833
to hear the young lady's history

197
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,418
at any time it might be
convenient to you both.

198
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,964
- Mr. Gutch, in view
of the articles

199
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,924
you've published about my
husband's bank

200
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,344
I think it unlikely that
he will allow you

201
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,763
even near our house,
good day sir.

202
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,057
- Good morning Mr. Gutch.

203
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,267
- Good morning.

204
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,359
I had never clapped eyes on
an Oriental princess before.

205
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,443
But then neither had Mrs.
Worrall.

206
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:13,489
As a journalist I know that
people will believe two things.

207
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,575
What they read in the newspapers

208
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:16,993
and what they want to believe.

209
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,496
And that's the way of the world.

210
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,206
- There.

211
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,586
Worrall.

212
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,797
- Oh, good night dear girl.

213
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,686
- Fancy Mrs. Worrall, royalty.

214
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,188
- Oh, we can't be sure of that.

215
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,121
- You go imply in your
newspaper that we are guilty

216
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,125
of corrupt practices in the
management of Tulsey's bank

217
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,876
and then you have the
bare-faced gall

218
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:09,211
to ask for admittance
into my house.

219
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,088
Next you'll be demanding
we publish Tulsey's

220
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,507
bank borrowing, am I not
right my dear?

221
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,593
- Mr. Worrall, let's not
confuse the two issues.

222
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,513
This girl has nothing to
do with Tulsey's bank.

223
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:21,849
Her story should be
told, and your kindness

224
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,143
and hospitality to a
stranger in distress

225
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,187
will not go un-remarked upon.

226
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:32,022
Don't you
try worming your way

227
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,071
into my house, Mr. Gutch,
I'm wise to your

228
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,781
reptilian foot in the door--

229
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,163
- Mrs. Worrall.

230
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,470
- Oh goodness, what
is she doing?

231
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,889
Whatever
it is, it's a bloody

232
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:01,806
stupid place for it.

233
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:08,688
Frixos, get over there
and get her down.

234
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,111
- Sir, I don't think
she finish her Psalm yet.

235
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,780
- Song, that's not a Psalm
for God's sake.

236
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,533
I'll do it myself, hold
the ladder now.

237
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,535
You got it Frixos?

238
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:23,994
- Yes I've got it.
- Well?

239
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,371
- Yes sir, I am here sir.

240
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,581
- Girl.
- Girl?

241
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,292
Caraboo Mr. Worrall.

242
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:35,586
- Princess, my dear, come
on, this way now, come to me.

243
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,477
- You are the butler,
aren't you Frixos?

244
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,812
- Yes, regrettably.

245
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,610
- Oh, Mr. Gutch.
- Mrs. Worrall.

246
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,823
I'm not entirely accustomed
to addressing foreign royalty.

247
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,909
What would be the
appropriate form, ma'am?

248
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,455
- You are amusing yourself
at my expense, Mr. Gutch.

249
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,832
We are not claiming that
she is royalty.

250
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,627
That was your
countryman McCarthy.

251
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:15,004
Anyway, you can judge
for yourself.

252
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:18,257
I'm sure you're capable
of that, Mr. Gutch.

253
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,761
My dear.

254
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,360
- Would it be appropriate
to kiss her hand?

255
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,362
I
suppose one might try.

256
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,722
- Does she speak any English?

257
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,098
- She's learning the odd word.

258
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,854
It seems that she was on a
ship, that she jumped overboard

259
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,063
and swam to shore.

260
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:16,982
- Shipwrecked.

261
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,318
- I've ventured that
perhaps she'd been enslaved

262
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,238
and that she escaped.

263
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,457
- Wherever she comes from
she's certainly exquisite.

264
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,084
May I try a little experiment?

265
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,588
Gutch.

266
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:47,592
- Caraboo, I trust this
is the accurate spelling.

267
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:50,808
Caraboo.

268
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:07,783
Caraboo.

269
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,284
- Oh, Mr. Gutch.

270
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,217
- I must tell Mr. Worrall.

271
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,849
- It's a good story, enslaved
princess washed ashore

272
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:37,517
in England, sell a lot
of newspapers.

273
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,567
But I must warn you, these
people will not take lightly

274
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,946
to being made fools of,
you should understand

275
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,991
that in this country,
perjury is a hanging offense.

276
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:05,841
- Mr. Worrall!

277
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,218
Mr.Worrall!

278
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,011
- Here I am.

279
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:13,349
- Oh, Mr. Worrall,
wonderful news.

280
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,852
The princess can write.

281
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,272
- Oh good, good, good.

282
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,117
- I'd be interested in anything
you might have to tell me.

283
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:36,748
- She very clever, this girl.

284
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,542
- Do you think she's a fraud?

285
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:43,128
- Yes, I know the quality,
these Worralls

286
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:47,133
they know nothing, they
are idiots, here sir.

287
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,554
Mr. Worrall is an idiot and
Mrs. Worrall is too kind.

288
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,390
That's why she fooled.

289
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,475
- It's a good story,
keep me informed

290
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,685
and I'll make it
worth your while.

291
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,655
Is this the village
of Almondsbury?

292
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,033
- Yes sir, it is.
- Thank you.

293
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,208
She drank it?

294
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,878
- A sip, she didn't like it.

295
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,255
- To think it Harold, there
you was plying a princess

296
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,257
with drink on your cart.

297
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:30,300
I was not plying her.

298
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,594
Just gave her a sip of me ale.

299
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:33,846
- And then what happened?

300
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,015
- She came with me on my
cart with Amon

301
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,017
what used to work up Tallis.

302
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:40,352
- I think you want to be
a Prince Charming Harold.

303
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,438
I think you was courting
her in your own quiet way.

304
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:43,105
- I was not.

305
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,318
Anyway, then she ran
off up to Almondsbury.

306
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:48,610
- Did she pay you?

307
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:53,111
- No, but she left this
behind when she ran off.

308
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,334
- Magdalen Hospital for
the reception

309
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,127
of penitent prostitutes.

310
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:11,133
Psalms, hymns, prayers,
rules, list of subscribers.

311
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,387
Is that what it says?

312
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
Where'd she get that then?

313
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,184
- Do you mind if I keep this?

314
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,645
- I can't read it anyway.

315
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,231
Of
course this proved nothing

316
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,486
but the idea, the idea of
it was almost too absurd

317
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,821
and too wonderful to
be possible.

318
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,492
- I take no responsibility
for any of this.

319
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:37,868
I just hope to God
you're not making

320
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,328
a bloody fool of yourself.

321
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,538
- She needs some
clothes made for her.

322
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,706
- At who's expense?

323
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,459
- Mr Worrall, she has no money.

324
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,836
We must do what is right.

325
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,012
Perhaps
this, or maybe this.

326
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,807
- Perhaps the princess finds
your taste too dowdy, my dear.

327
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:03,143
Maybe these Bristol modes
aren't fashionable enough.

328
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:21,912
Of course,
she wants her native attire.

329
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,665
- Not too native, if you
take my meaning.

330
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:29,461
- And to accompany
this there is no.

331
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,847
No, no.

332
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:46,186
No-

333
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,814
- Oh I think she likes this one.

334
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,733
- The princess has
chosen one of my finest.

335
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:57,614
- Is that what she wears, Mrs.
Worrall?

336
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,576
- It's very Oriental,
very Oriental.

337
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,127
- Your flag tells the
world that our home

338
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,881
has become your home my
clear, as long as you wish

339
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:14,923
to remain in England.

340
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:32,524
- You're a fraud, I know
you're a fraud

341
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,901
and I have spit in your soup.

342
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,204
No, personally I have
pissed in it.

343
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,957
- Frixos, are you
addressing the princess?

344
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,584
I am telling
her about the soup.

345
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,087
It is cream of
sorrell and the cook

346
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,255
hope she like it very much.

347
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,092
You know she
doesn't understand English.

348
00:27:58,092 --> 00:28:00,594
- Neither does Frixos, so maybe

349
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,681
they'll understand each other.

350
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,397
You see my dear, she appreciates
my little witticisms.

351
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,900
- Surely you only
address a guest

352
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,904
when they address you, Frixos.

353
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,614
Yes madam.

354
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,990
Oh dear,
she's tired out.

355
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,242
Your cream of sorrell's
done for, Frixos.

356
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:29,077
- I'll take her upstairs,
sweet dear creature.

357
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,253
I'd better go and see
that she's comfortable.

358
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:38,090
- Good night my clear,
and to you too, my dear.

359
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,472
What's the matter
with you Frixos?

360
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,600
- Nothing, nothing.

361
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,394
Mrs. Worrall is a
very kind woman.

362
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,104
She a saint, a saint.

363
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:54,064
- So I'm told.

364
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,317
- When I was in the
army in Athens

365
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,484
the capital of my country.

366
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,196
- Athens, yes, the Acropolis,
democracy.

367
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,324
- I once met a woman who
took in all the stray dog

368
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,661
in our quarter, until
finally she have 38 dog.

369
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,789
- 38?
- Yes.

370
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:13,584
- What is your point, Frixos?

371
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,003
- That a lot of dog.

372
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,136
- That is a lot of dog.

373
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,404
- Look at this.
- Oh, oh.

374
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,868
Look at this, Mr. Frixos.

375
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:51,413
What a thing
to do to your face.

376
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,631
- Oh, let's see, let's see,
oh Mr. Frixos.

377
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,135
- Betty.

378
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,555
- When we get back I want
you to keep the princess

379
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,182
upstairs for 10 minutes
before bringing her down.

380
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:14,311
- To make the grand
entrance for the Apthorpes.

381
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,063
- Yes that's right, it's
important that she makes

382
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,023
an excellent impression,
the Apthorpes are friends

383
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,316
of the Prince Regent.

384
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,236
You'll break your bloody
neck woman, do get in.

385
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,823
- Mr. Worrall, I'm not
sure I should leave her

386
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:26,949
with just the servants.

387
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:28,200
- What do you mean,
just the servants?

388
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,659
Come on, she'll be
perfectly all right.

389
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,955
Stop it, Mr. Worrall.

390
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:07,026
- Princess, if you come clean

391
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,074
then we won't tell Mrs. Worrall.

392
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:14,413
You see, we're not gonna
have you lording over us

393
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:16,540
when we know you're as
humble as us.

394
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,004
- We want to look at your arms.

395
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,259
Your arms, here, have a look.

396
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,345
- It seems she don't like men.

397
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,972
- You do it then,
you're a woman.

398
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:39,730
- See, of course she
don't have any.

399
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,440
- That is only her arms.

400
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:47,363
- So where else do savages
put their tattoos, Mr. Frixos?

401
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:50,824
On their bums they do,
let's have look all over.

402
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,285
You hold her arms,
push her over.

403
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,750
Oh, Mr. Frixos, look at that.

404
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:35,076
- Was that you screaming, Mr.
Frixos?

405
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,998
- I am not often wrong, Mrs.
Wilberforce.

406
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,211
But I was wrong about her.

407
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,795
Little savage.

408
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,759
- Thank you Betty.

409
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,400
- Come in.

410
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,610
- There's a Mr. Frixos
to see you sir.

411
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,322
- Fine, thank you.

412
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:18,161
- Frixos.

413
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,876
- You print the works of Mr.
Coleridge.

414
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,713
A poet of great imagination.

415
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:29,756
- Unfortunately his
imagination does not run

416
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,842
to paying his last two bills.

417
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,718
Have you got something for me?

418
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:34,803
- I find out something.

419
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:44,521
She bite me, she
bite me so hard.

420
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,816
I know this is not the
bite of a civilized woman.

421
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:53,197
And now I have no more doubt,
only a savage would do this.

422
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:59,536
- My God, it's severe, but
it's not proof, Frixos.

423
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,372
- I have proof, I go
to the library

424
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:06,001
and I see in the book of Mr.
Cook's voyages in the Pacific.

425
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:08,920
The peoples have the
tattoos on their bodies.

426
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,298
She had this same tattoo.

427
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,425
- Really, that is interesting.

428
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,885
- I have seen it on her leg.

429
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:20,473
She had very beautiful
leg for a savage.

430
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,069
- It is a sizeable place,
there should be

431
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:33,320
an opportunity for profit.

432
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,448
Look at Baggers who took
the salon trade

433
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,200
and two years later he
built himself a palace.

434
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,619
- I've been mulling it over.

435
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,412
- I would half rather
be pleased to grant you

436
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,790
favorable conditions
for a trading company.

437
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,916
- I should damn well hope so

438
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,709
I saved you from the poorhouse.

439
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,005
- If there was a
possibility for investment.

440
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,425
- You my lord, you will be
the first I shall approach.

441
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,636
Frixos, you know who broke this?

442
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,850
Well find out who did
it and get rid of them.

443
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,642
It's an heirloom.

444
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:09,189
What's
she a" about?

445
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:09,981
- Caraboo.

446
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,860
- I think she's
saying she did it.

447
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:23,866
Caraboo.

448
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,917
<i>Caraboo.</i>

449
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,209
Hell's bells.

450
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,462
- She's an arbiter of taste, Mr.
Worrall.

451
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,010
- You must bring her to Bath.

452
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,763
We could present her at
a ball, a costume ball.

453
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,352
Javasoo costume, my dear could
you imagine the sensation

454
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,979
the sensation she would cause.

455
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,814
It might be a little
overwhelming just yet,

456
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,649
Lady Apthorpe.

457
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,570
I'm so pleased you could come.

458
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,696
- Thank you ma'am.

459
00:35:57,696 --> 00:35:58,822
The
princess has shown

460
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,990
not a little interest
in the piano.

461
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,118
- I though we might
start with a composition

462
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:04,994
of Franz Schubert, ma'am,
if you think

463
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:07,288
it would please the princess.

464
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:10,458
- Yes, I think it might,
Lady Apthorpe?

465
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,920
What is it, Frixos?

466
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,215
- I'm observing the correct
manner for the turban

467
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,718
in honor of the princess.

468
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:22,387
Very good,
could you call the others in?

469
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,180
- Yes ma'am.

470
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,849
- Cinnamon, sandalwood.

471
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,687
- Xanadu did Kublai Khan, a
stately pleasure dome decree.

472
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,356
Saffron,
cardamom.

473
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:36,026
- Cardamom?
- Cardamom.

474
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:41,281
Oh my God.

475
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,449
I suppose our
presence is required.

476
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,993
- Yes.

477
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:49,288
I hate
musical evenings, always have.

478
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:50,581
Isn't that right, Frixos?

479
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:51,916
- Yes sir.

480
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,780
- There is also the
diplomatic aspect.

481
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,282
We could use an ally
off the Javanese coast

482
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:27,452
to counter the Dutch, if
we achieve that

483
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,873
it would not go
unnoticed at Court.

484
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,043
A knighthood at least, a
peerage perhaps

485
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:36,627
if I could influence
the outcome.

486
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,424
- That would please Mrs.
Worrall a good deal, I dare say.

487
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,552
Personally I'm mostly
indifferent to that

488
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,345
sort of thing.

489
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:48,056
- Sh, Mr. Worrall please.

490
00:37:48,056 --> 00:37:51,184
- Come now, milord
Worrall has a certain

491
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,228
ring to it, does it not, what?

492
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,191
- Oh my clear, what
is the matter?

493
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,695
No, no stop, please
stop playing.

494
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:52,746
- Play on, please play on.

495
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,124
- It is honor to play for
one so sensitive

496
00:38:56,124 --> 00:38:57,792
to Mr. Schubert's music, ma'am.

497
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,356
- That Schubert was quite
superb, was it good now.

498
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:20,482
- Yes it was good.

499
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,567
- Good night, so glad
you enjoyed it.

500
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,278
- Thank you so much.
- It was a great pleasure.

501
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,780
- Oh ho, your honor, that form.

502
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,448
- And don't forget.
- No, no.

503
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:31,617
- Thank you so much.
- Your carriage awaits.

504
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:34,954
- Good night, Lady Apthorpe.
- Good night.

505
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,958
- Extraordinary behavior,
blubbing like that.

506
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,086
- Oh, I found it so charming.

507
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,712
Of course she'll die of boredom.

508
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,880
- Another five minutes with Mr.
Worrall

509
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,841
and I will succumb myself.

510
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,385
- Bye.
- Bye.

511
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,059
Preposterous couple.

512
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,101
- Come along.

513
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,361
- A monopoly, a spice monopoly.

514
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,868
I'm going to be so rich.

515
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:34,597
- Of course without
seeing the tattoo

516
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,098
I cannot comment on it,
but this is rubbish.

517
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,564
Scribbles, not Malay
or Javanese.

518
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:46,025
They bear no relation
to Chinese characters.

519
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,736
- What about these coins?

520
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,530
- Javanese, Indian, any
sailor employed

521
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,950
in the Eastern trade might
come back with a handful.

522
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,535
- My first instinct was
that it's all

523
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:57,245
an elaborate deception.

524
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:58,996
Judging by
these your first instinct

525
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:00,790
is the appropriate one.

526
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,836
- But there's something
about her, in her bearing.

527
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:08,965
Pride, spirit, I can't
quite dismiss her.

528
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,676
- She's an imposter.

529
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:16,431
But at least she is an
imaginative one.

530
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,142
In fact, I should be
intrigued to see

531
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:22,854
this interpretation of an
Oriental queen.

532
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,113
- I sense you're trying to
do her down, the pair of you.

533
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,239
- That's certainly not the case.

534
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,740
Neither on my part, nor
the professor.

535
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,159
- I'm not here to treat her
maliciously Mr. Worrall.

536
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,619
This is a purely
academic inquiry.

537
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,915
Hers is a language I have
never before encountered.

538
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,876
- We're all wary of imposters.

539
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:47,545
A shoemaker's son is
now imprisoned in RualI

540
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,506
for pretending to be Louis XVII.

541
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:51,674
- I read about it, it
was the French.

542
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,177
- The confidence of
your potential investors

543
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:56,220
in the spice trade
depends entirely

544
00:41:56,221 --> 00:41:58,556
on this girl, does it not?

545
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,400
No.

546
00:42:19,077 --> 00:42:23,577
No, ah, Malboric.

547
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:38,175
No, aha, Mangean.

548
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:52,231
No. Ah, Mandarin

549
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:02,954
No?

550
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:19,053
No-

551
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,478
Do you know what this is?

552
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,273
Of course you do, it's a
counting string.

553
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,569
Common to every known
culture of the Orient.

554
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,990
Perhaps you'd like to
demonstrate to these gentlemen

555
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,242
just how it works.

556
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,704
Two, four, six figs, six.

557
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,380
Show us six.

558
00:44:32,377 --> 00:44:36,589
Aha, by her calculations
there are in the region

559
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,509
of 2000 figs on the table.

560
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:40,760
Perhaps she
uses a different method.

561
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,136
- I think not.

562
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,222
- There are six figs, she
can see as well as we can.

563
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:47,725
- Perhaps so, but she cannot
count them on this cord.

564
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,145
Thank you Mr. Worrall,
this is a beautiful house

565
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,815
and I always enjoy a few
days away from Oxford.

566
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,441
- You've proven nothing
one way or another.

567
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,360
As I understand it there
are thousands of islands

568
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,778
in the East Indies, why
shouldn't one of them

569
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:00,029
have been overlooked?

570
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,200
- I beg your pardon?

571
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,418
- What does that mean?

572
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:15,002
means black.

573
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,839
In several languages right
across India and Asia.

574
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,805
- She's saying you've
got black teeth.

575
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:28,182
You should get them pulled.

576
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,560
- Mr. Worrall, have you
examined the markings

577
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,270
on her buttock?

578
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,854
- No, certainly not,
what do you take me for?

579
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:35,231
Perhaps we
should do so now, what?

580
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,983
- I think you'll find her
rather reluctant

581
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:39,527
as Mr. Frixos found out.

582
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:40,945
- Let us understand each other.

583
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:44,199
Are you suggesting we
disrobe her here and now?

584
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:51,498
- What does it mean?
- It means God.

585
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,665
Well
that makes sense.

586
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,000
She's gone to her prayers.

587
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,386
- Tell me that's not a heathen.

588
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,598
- Mr. Worrall, would it be
possible for me to stay here

589
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:12,393
for a couple of days rather
than go back to my college?

590
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,104
I'm not prepared to dismiss her

591
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,356
without further investigation.

592
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,816
- Perhaps you'd be good enough
to let me know the outcome.

593
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,193
- Yes, of course.

594
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,864
It's most intriguing.

595
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,918
- What does that mean?

596
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,754
- Goodbye, I presume.

597
00:46:39,754 --> 00:46:41,088
- That's what I thought.

598
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,841
- But not in Rijang or Lampun.

599
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:44,634
No-

600
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,307
- Gently around my arm,
simple as that.

601
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,101
This is the proper way.

602
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:12,161
You're a terrible student.

603
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,497
I will not forget this,
you come back here.

604
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,132
- Caraboo, Caraboo.

605
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:47,488
It's a surprise.

606
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,116
- What kind of surprise?

607
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:54,616
- Well if I told you it wouldn't
be a surprise, would it?

608
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,083
- Round, the world is round.

609
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:11,345
I tried
to imagine her in her world.

610
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,556
Far off place with a
beautiful name.

611
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,602
But I kept going back to a
more intriguing

612
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:22,102
and complicated idea, the
idea of an ordinary girl

613
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,442
with an extraordinary
imagination.

614
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:31,448
â™ª Why should you let your
wandering eyes â™ª

615
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:35,949
â™ª Entice your souls to
shame for sin â™ª

616
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:40,666
â™ª Scandal and ruin
are the prize â™ª

617
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:46,418
â™ª You take such fatal
ways to win â™ª

618
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:53,550
â™ª The brutal vice which
reason lied â™ª

619
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:56,307
- Mr Gutch, Harrison,
surveyor of the charity.

620
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:02,272
- Thank you for seeing me,
you have an excellent choir.

621
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,232
They practice hard.

622
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,276
- What happens to the women
who pass through here?

623
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,529
- We try to find
employment for them.

624
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,156
Some lead diligent,
God-fearing lives.

625
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,200
Others, God bless them,
don't stay on

626
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,077
the straight and narrow,
fall back onto the streets.

627
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:18,996
This is one
of your prayer books.

628
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,165
I came by it near Almondsbury.

629
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,668
- I was hoping to see
some names in it.

630
00:49:23,668 --> 00:49:24,794
They write their names in them.

631
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:27,046
It's forbidden, but they
all do it anyway.

632
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:28,589
- But there are no names.

633
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,885
- No, so it belonged to one
of our patrons or subscribers.

634
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,470
Anyone who gives a good
sum to the charity

635
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,889
is presented with one of them.

636
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,683
- Would you be able to give
me a list of your patrons

637
00:49:38,683 --> 00:49:40,685
and of the women who've
been discharged

638
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:42,520
from the charity in
the last year?

639
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,897
I'm doing an article
for my newspaper

640
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,649
and I'd like to talk to
some of them.

641
00:49:46,649 --> 00:49:48,317
What
kind of article?

642
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,279
- A respectful one, I
respect the work you do here.

643
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,698
The kindness with
which you do it.

644
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:03,207
- Worrall, enormously
grateful for this opportunity.

645
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,711
Her ladyship hasn't
stopped talking about this

646
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:08,504
and neither has all of Bath.

647
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:13,005
- Bath is abuzz, abuzz, she
is the sensation of the town.

648
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,386
- Good, good.

649
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:27,981
- Apthorpe and Hobhouse
approached me in town.

650
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:30,025
Both sniffing after
an investment.

651
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:37,866
- There's plenty of that,
the word is out.

652
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,452
Look at them, they can
smell the spice.

653
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,538
There's the bloody
journalist again.

654
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,750
- Now Sam, his articles are
provoking considerable interest.

655
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:50,170
- Oh Mr. Gutch, I did
enjoy your article

656
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:52,590
and I showed it to the princess.

657
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,966
- Did she manage to read it?

658
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,345
- I think she comes from
a tribe of woman warriors

659
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,722
Mrs. Worrall, just as well
she wasn't with

660
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,014
Napoleon at Waterloo.

661
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:04,435
- Oh, Lord Willington said
the same thing.

662
00:51:04,435 --> 00:51:05,894
- He'd been presented already?

663
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,191
If
this girl had really

664
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,526
come from the streets
but had invented

665
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,363
her own language and kingdom
to make fools of the class

666
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,406
she had been taught to
fear and obey.

667
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:21,493
If she'd been so
imaginative as to do that

668
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,163
I swear I would
cherish her forever.

669
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,918
- The Dutch have colonized
many islands in the East Indies

670
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:30,711
but I suspect there are
still many more

671
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,423
that lie far enough away
from the trade routes

672
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,176
to remain uncontacted
and unexplored.

673
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:40,762
We believe the princess
comes from somewhere here

674
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:45,142
near Mindanao, her
dialect being Manguindago.

675
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,020
You have probably read
Mr. Gutch's accounts

676
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,565
in Felix Farley's
Bristol Journal

677
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,277
of the circumstances,
sad circumstances

678
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,570
by which she arrived
upon our shores

679
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,282
stolen from her palace
home by pirates.

680
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,826
Sold as a slave to the
captain of a merchant ship

681
00:52:01,826 --> 00:52:04,078
from whom she escaped
by courageously jumping

682
00:52:04,078 --> 00:52:07,039
overboard in the
Bristol channel.

683
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,834
- A lock of the princess hair,
souvenirs?

684
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:15,297
Thank you.

685
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,721
- Have you ever been to London?

686
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,434
- Ah, Caraboo book.

687
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:30,729
Ah, so you've
seen it before.

688
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,984
- England, book, Caraboo.

689
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:37,361
- Did someone give it to you?

690
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,157
Did someone give it to you?

691
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,534
- Caraboo book.

692
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:47,788
If I may.

693
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:59,049
- I'm sorry, I'm
going to use it.

694
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,352
- Princess, princess,
the tattoo.

695
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,657
With your permission, princess.

696
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:19,834
You can trust me, I'll
just have a little look.

697
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,514
This is a scholarly
investigation.

698
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,858
Just a little further, oh yes,
yes.

699
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:44,859
No, princess, that is too
far, my heavens, perfection.

700
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:54,498
Mrs. Worrall.

701
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,837
- Mr. Wilkinson, it's Sunday.

702
00:54:59,837 --> 00:55:03,340
- I beg you, Mrs. Worrall,
don't jump to conclusions.

703
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,135
I was merely in the
interests of scholarship

704
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,678
examining her tattoo.

705
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,348
- I'm sure you were Mr.
Wilkinson.

706
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,061
But I do feel in the
interests of propriety

707
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,813
a maid at least should
have been present.

708
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,024
Good night, Mr. Wilkinson.

709
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,193
Professor, what is it?

710
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:26,196
- Never in my lifetime
has such a flame

711
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:30,697
been lit within me, I don't
know which way to turn.

712
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:39,960
- Poor man.

713
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,006
- Made a bloody fool of
himself, a bloody fool.

714
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:46,258
He served his purpose.

715
00:55:48,135 --> 00:55:50,137
I want some peace around
here, it's like having

716
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:51,721
a bitch on heat in the house.

717
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,391
- Mr. Worrall.

718
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,769
You are finished sir.

719
00:55:56,769 --> 00:55:58,729
- No, I am not finished.

720
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:06,487
- You're a long way from
home and perhaps lonely.

721
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:12,530
A princess' duty is to her
station, her royal station.

722
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,454
- How is she going to
understand that, for God's sake.

723
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:19,666
Men, no-y, no men.

724
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:23,087
Understand, no men, or
anyone else for that matter.

725
00:56:23,087 --> 00:56:25,631
- Keep your voice down, Mr.
Worrall, you'll upset her.

726
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:28,258
- We spent a lot of
money on you.

727
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,386
A bed like that
doesn't come cheap.

728
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,596
- Oh, I think you've made
your point, Mr. Worrall.

729
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,348
I hope I have.

730
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:42,272
- Rijang, I knew she was
telling the truth, those eyes.

731
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,191
Shall I see you at
Harvest Thanksgiving?

732
00:56:44,191 --> 00:56:46,234
- Afraid not, I'm on my
way to London.

733
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,965
Any man
obsessed is to be pitied.

734
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,385
And it wasn't just the
story I was obsessed with.

735
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,762
It was her.

736
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,266
Although I longed to discover
something about the girl

737
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:20,394
one side of me was heartened
to be finding nothing.

738
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,939
If I did discover a
different tale

739
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:27,192
to publish it would be
to condemn her.

740
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,707
- I'll never take in another
one from the Magdalene.

741
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:45,961
The girl stole and there
were always men

742
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,173
knocking on the door,
lurking in the mews.

743
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:50,424
What happened to her?

744
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:53,593
- She's dead,
drowned at Chatham.

745
00:57:55,763 --> 00:58:00,263
â™ª Good is the Lord whose
liberal hand â™ª

746
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,650
â™ª Is steady opened wide â™ª

747
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:26,334
- Ah, here's a little
person, where is everyone?

748
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:27,961
- They've all gone to church.

749
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,506
- And why aren't you at church?

750
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:33,383
- I'm a Catholic.
- Tut tut.

751
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,929
My dear girl, we have not
come here to see the Worralls.

752
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:40,307
We have come to see the
princess, take me to her.

753
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:46,981
â™ª Earth is dead â™ª

754
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:50,985
â™ª Redeem the path,
instead reach â™ª

755
00:58:54,488 --> 00:58:56,031
- Look at this.

756
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,159
- Oh I say, that is fine.

757
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,286
- I don't suppose they
even know it's here.

758
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,998
- Rupert, I have been
explaining to the princess

759
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:08,544
that the Prince Regent himself
has especially requested

760
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:09,753
that she attend the ball.

761
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,672
- And what did her
highness say to that?

762
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:13,632
- She said she would be
delighted to come.

763
00:59:13,632 --> 00:59:15,842
Delighted, a
scholar on little melanges.

764
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,762
I had no idea you could
speak to Javasoo.

765
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:23,016
- The bitch.
- Which one?

766
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,436
- Lady Apthorpe, of course.

767
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,855
I'm sure she gave the
princess no choice.

768
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:28,814
Did she give her any choice?

769
00:59:28,814 --> 00:59:30,190
- Did she?

770
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,776
- No ma'am, they made me
take down the princess' flag

771
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,403
and they took her off.

772
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:35,737
- We're gonna go to this ball.

773
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,908
- No, I can't bear to,
it'll be so demeaning.

774
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,661
- So we'll be demeaned, it
won't be the first time.

775
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,302
Good morning, John
Gutch to see Mrs. Peake.

776
00:59:58,302 --> 00:59:59,261
- Won't you come in sir?

777
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,887
Thank you.

778
01:00:04,016 --> 01:00:06,893
- We've had three girls from
the charity in the last year.

779
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,605
I look upon it as a duty
to take them in.

780
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:11,064
- And what's become of them?

781
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,734
- May I ask why you're
asking these questions?

782
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:15,819
- Mr. Gutch is writing an
article for his newspaper

783
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,113
on the Magdalene charity,
on the good work

784
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,156
that the charity does.

785
01:00:19,156 --> 01:00:20,615
- I see.

786
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,909
- Two are still with us,
and the third has left

787
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,661
to go to another household.

788
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:28,707
Oh, but that one was
never a prostitute.

789
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,502
In fact, when Harrison
asked her how long

790
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,545
she'd been on the town,
she thought he was asking

791
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,464
how long she'd been in London.

792
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:36,506
She was a simple girl.

793
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:42,053
- What did she look like,
this girl?

794
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,806
Was she beautiful?

795
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,184
- Beautiful, no I
never thought so.

796
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,604
But men often have such
different views.

797
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,482
You wouldn't describe
her as beautiful

798
01:00:53,482 --> 01:00:54,941
would you my dear?

799
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:58,070
- No, no I would not.

800
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,822
- Her name is Mary Baker,
she's with a Mrs. Matthews

801
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:05,202
in Clapham, she's a kind woman
who seems fond of the girl.

802
01:01:05,202 --> 01:01:08,371
I'll give you her address,
and you can decide

803
01:01:08,372 --> 01:01:10,040
for yourself if you agree
with my husband

804
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,000
on the question of
her good looks.

805
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,254
- If she's presently employed
in Clapham I won't need to.

806
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,631
Thank you for your time.

807
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:19,591
- Charlotte, see Mr. Gutch out,
my dear.

808
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,428
Thank you very much.

809
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:30,765
That means goodbye.

810
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:38,152
- In what language?
- It's Mary's language.

811
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,319
- Come along Miss Peake.

812
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,327
With
those three words

813
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:49,747
the world of imagination
had become one of reality.

814
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:07,931
â™ª Balls of wits and
wicked stardust â™ª

815
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,184
â™ª Former leaders fair maligned â™ª

816
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,394
â™ª All the nightfall's
been affected â™ª

817
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,604
â™ª Hand unsteady as the wind â™ª

818
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,442
- His royal highness, the
Prince Regent.

819
01:02:18,442 --> 01:02:19,651
- Sh.

820
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,695
â™ª So much altered from
what ladies â™ª

821
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,072
â™ª Were 2000 years ago â™ª

822
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,283
â™ª If they call an after nature â™ª

823
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:28,952
â™ª Blessed on English
dreams I dreamt â™ª

824
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,871
â™ª So much altered from
what ladies â™ª

825
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:33,206
â™ª Were 2000 years ago â™ª

826
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,459
â™ª Even once the accusation â™ª

827
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:37,919
â™ª Men our sex unjustly blame â™ª

828
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,006
â™ª They are slaves to â™ª

829
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:44,968
- My dear Margaret, the dance.

830
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:47,596
- King?

831
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,723
- No, no dear, this is his son.

832
01:02:49,723 --> 01:02:52,225
An absolutely different
kettle of fish.

833
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:56,726
- Oh how witty, look at
all of us, all dressed up.

834
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,400
- Your royal highness, may
I present her royal highness

835
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,659
Princess Caraboo of the
island nation of Javasoo.

836
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:17,125
- May we instruct our
new cousin in the new

837
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,711
continental dance which
the press has declared

838
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:24,212
unwholesome, disreputable,
and lascivious?

839
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:37,395
- Oh dear.

840
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:42,734
- An imprudent choice of
costume, Charles.

841
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,156
- Now, it's really
terribly simple.

842
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:53,866
Back, side, together, one, two,
three.

843
01:03:56,957 --> 01:04:00,543
Back, side, together, one, two,
three.

844
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:08,843
Margaret, she's a very
good little dancer.

845
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,239
Quite enchanting,
quite enchanting.

846
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,866
- Sweet.

847
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:58,370
- Now when my new pavilion
at Brighton is completed

848
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:00,330
you shall live in it.

849
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:15,178
- I'm not going in.

850
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:21,268
I'm
certainly not going in.

851
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:23,311
- This is so humiliating.

852
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:26,815
I feel ridiculous.

853
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,567
- I feel ridiculous too.

854
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,099
- Highness.

855
01:07:03,101 --> 01:07:04,393
- Who is that fellow?

856
01:07:04,394 --> 01:07:06,020
I
don't know sir.

857
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,522
- The trouble with the
aristocracy today

858
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,025
is that they have no respect
for the royal family.

859
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:11,192
- Probably a Republican.

860
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,159
- Mary, Mary Baker, I
know that you are

861
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:24,581
Mary Baker from Witherich,
I fear for you.

862
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:27,917
I fear that you'll
be discovered.

863
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,961
The consequences of that
will be terrible.

864
01:07:50,774 --> 01:07:53,401
- Stop it, I know you
are Mary Baker.

865
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,237
Have you any idea of the danger

866
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,571
you're putting yourself in?

867
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,663
Mary, I care what
happens to you.

868
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:07,332
I know you think this is
all an amusement

869
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:10,084
but it's a mad and dangerous
thing you're doing.

870
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:14,756
Princess?

871
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,140
- Princess, may we
have the pleasure

872
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:24,223
of the next dance?

873
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,538
Who was that fellow,
looked like Byron.

874
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,251
- This way sir.

875
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:18,588
- Wake up, wake up.
- What's happening?

876
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,799
- It's morning.

877
01:10:21,883 --> 01:10:23,092
- Are they still dancing?

878
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:26,721
- No, no, it's quiet.

879
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:31,225
- God's teeth, what shall we do?

880
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:36,105
Do you think we should go in?

881
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,440
Do you think you should go in?

882
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,694
Yes, I'll wait here.

883
01:11:31,536 --> 01:11:34,830
- Oh, Jane, what a shame
you're so late.

884
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:40,086
You missed a marvelous evening.

885
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:41,962
Yes, you have.

886
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:43,005
- I wasn't aware I was invited.

887
01:11:44,424 --> 01:11:48,219
Well of course you were,
silly girl.

888
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:05,486
- Well done, Mrs. Worrall,
my darling, darling woman.

889
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,362
Well done.

890
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,460
Mr. Worrall sir, sir.

891
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:25,465
- God, they've sent
troops after us.

892
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:34,474
Halt, halt in the
name of the Prince Regent.

893
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,865
- Lieutenant Gordon at
your service ma'am.

894
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,326
I am charged by his royal
highness the Prince Regent

895
01:12:53,326 --> 01:12:56,662
to ensure safe passage to
you and your attendants

896
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:57,997
to your place of residence.

897
01:13:02,168 --> 01:13:04,044
- Ha, jolly good, well done.

898
01:13:05,755 --> 01:13:10,255
Convey our gratitude to his
royal highness, carry on.

899
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,186
March!

900
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,406
This
girl's story would sell

901
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:35,201
my newspaper, but it was
much more than just a story.

902
01:13:35,201 --> 01:13:38,412
To me she was the most
wonderful creature in the world.

903
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,164
And I was not going to
endanger her.

904
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,293
I put her at enough
risk already.

905
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,838
Here's the piece on the ball.

906
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,340
- That's all of it, I
thought you said

907
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,717
you'd be a longer piece.

908
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,635
- I decided against the
longer version.

909
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:07,734
- Ah, at a ball given in her
honor by Lord and Lady Apthorpe

910
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:12,234
the Princess Caraboo, wearing
a simple white elegant dress

911
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,991
danced with a variety
of handsome partners.

912
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:18,411
- Go on, Mr. Frixos.

913
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:24,458
- But her most ardent
and persistent admirer

914
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:28,959
appeared to be the Prince
Regent himself.

915
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:36,805
- I hope your majesty
will approve

916
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,682
the form of invitation
to a modest ball

917
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:42,686
to be held her at Nowell
in your majesty's honor

918
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:45,105
at the end of the
month of November.

919
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,233
We are hoping that your
recent presentation

920
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:51,194
to the Prince Regent will
encourage his royal highness

921
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:54,780
to do us the honor of
attending the festivity.

922
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:04,332
- Does she understand?

923
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:11,380
- She will.

924
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:03,099
- Please go on, Mrs. Peake.

925
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,228
- When I told Charlotte
about the princess

926
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:11,190
in the newspaper, we don't
often see the Bristol papers.

927
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,526
She told me that the girl
who was in our employ

928
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,737
Mary Baker was her
name, had often told her

929
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,616
a bedtime story of a similar
princess who was kidnapped

930
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:24,495
from her palace sold as a
slave and jumped off a ship

931
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:28,249
in the Bristol Channel, it's
an odd coincidence, yes?

932
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:45,224
- Mary?

933
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,279
Mary?

934
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:04,285
Mary, don't you recognize me?

935
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:05,327
- It is Mary.

936
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,839
- Mrs. Worrall, there's no
doubt about it.

937
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,050
This is the girl I
employed myself as a maid.

938
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:26,766
- Is this true?

939
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,696
- Very sorry ma'am,
I'm very sorry.

940
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,886
- Worthless, because of her,
worthless!

941
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,472
Damn her, she lied, and
that is perjury.

942
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:10,685
- But a trial, a spectacle,
surely we don't want to

943
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:12,436
undermine the position
of the bank any further.

944
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,355
- The bank's done for Sam.

945
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:16,732
The world knows we've
been made bloody fools of.

946
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,611
- We are really the guilty ones.

947
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:23,030
- Who's guilty, us?

948
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:27,531
- Yes, us, we wanted her
to be a princess.

949
01:18:27,785 --> 01:18:30,329
You for greed and to
enrich yourselves

950
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,749
and I to gain the
admiration of society.

951
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:38,338
- And as Christians we are
taught blessed are the merciful.

952
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:42,300
- Rubbish, the law is the
law, and I as magistrate

953
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,094
and you as citizens have
a moral responsibility

954
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:47,554
to put a criminal like
that at the end of a rope.

955
01:18:48,973 --> 01:18:50,599
Don't we Sam?

956
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,353
- But you can't hang this
girl for what she's done.

957
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:55,897
Oh yes I can.

958
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,315
- I think Mr. Haythorne
is right my dear.

959
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:58,983
We do have a moral
responsibility.

960
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,988
- Mr. Worrall, until now
I was not fully aware

961
01:19:03,988 --> 01:19:06,740
of the true nature of
your character.

962
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:16,417
- Well hang her tomorrow,
are you with me?

963
01:19:18,169 --> 01:19:19,670
- I'm with you, of course.

964
01:19:27,428 --> 01:19:31,557
- Mrs. Worrall, may I have
a word with you please?

965
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,860
- Mr. Worrall says he's
gonna have her hanged.

966
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,737
- Hanged, poor princess.

967
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,658
Will they do it do you think?

968
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:49,784
Of
course they will.

969
01:19:49,784 --> 01:19:51,160
They've done folk for less.

970
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:53,955
- Yes, but to be hanged.

971
01:19:56,582 --> 01:20:00,210
- Well, I wish I had the
pluck to do what she done.

972
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,589
She made fools of them
all, see, and she had

973
01:20:03,589 --> 01:20:05,090
the time of her life doing it.

974
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,054
That girl danced all night
with the Prince Regent.

975
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:12,806
Well I say good on her, that's
what I say, good on her.

976
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,016
- That's what I say too.

977
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:17,186
- That's Worrall's best claret.

978
01:20:17,186 --> 01:20:17,978
- Sod him.

979
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:29,073
To her royal highness, she
not Greek, she not French.

980
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:35,496
She not Indian, she not
African, she not Russian.

981
01:20:37,081 --> 01:20:41,581
She our own princess, long
live the Princess Caraboo.

982
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,799
- Long live the
Princess Caraboo.

983
01:20:46,799 --> 01:20:49,426
- Long live the
Princess Caraboo.

984
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:21,500
- I suppose you've come
to tell me you told me so.

985
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:23,211
- I haven't come to do that.

986
01:21:28,549 --> 01:21:30,592
- I'm sorry to have
deceived Mrs. Worrall

987
01:21:30,593 --> 01:21:33,429
'cause she was deceived
because she was kind.

988
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:36,723
But them others, Mr.
Worrall and them others

989
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,644
I don't mind about them.

990
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,523
- They're the ones that
may cost you.

991
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:50,988
- Well, I don't care what
they do to me.

992
01:21:54,617 --> 01:21:56,035
- I care what they do to you.

993
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,246
I don't think what you've
done is reprehensible.

994
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:02,416
I think it's remarkable,
an adventure.

995
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:09,256
- Adventure, I suppose it was.

996
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:18,223
- How did you make up the
story, invent the language?

997
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:19,725
It's a feat of the imagination.

998
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:22,603
- Is that what it is?

999
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:25,147
It wasn't nothing difficult.

1000
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:31,149
Them sailors all have tales
to tell of far-off lands

1001
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:34,031
from roving far over the oceans.

1002
01:22:34,031 --> 01:22:35,907
- Is that where it started?

1003
01:22:35,908 --> 01:22:40,078
- No, London.

1004
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:45,793
I seen a French girl begging,
and I see how good she does

1005
01:22:45,793 --> 01:22:47,252
because people take
pity on her plight

1006
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,880
before they do on one of
their own kind.

1007
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:54,381
So I try pretending I'm French,
to beg.

1008
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,680
But they take me to
see a Frenchman.

1009
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,392
So I has to pretend
I'm someone else

1010
01:23:01,392 --> 01:23:02,810
and that's how it starts.

1011
01:23:04,395 --> 01:23:07,523
I don't know, it was easy.

1012
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:14,279
When I was her, the princess,
I was her.

1013
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:21,870
I just become her, it
comes natural

1014
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:25,416
and I'm not Mary Baker no more,
I'm her.

1015
01:23:29,754 --> 01:23:31,714
- I'd like to hear you
tell her story.

1016
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:37,260
- I'm not telling it,
you'll be here all night.

1017
01:23:37,261 --> 01:23:39,263
- Tell me part of it,
a small part.

1018
01:23:40,848 --> 01:23:42,474
From the moment
where she escapes

1019
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:43,851
from the English captain.

1020
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:45,727
When she lands in England,
if you like.

1021
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:53,194
- â€œLand ho," cries the sailor.

1022
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:57,615
Now the princess don't
know what that means

1023
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:01,452
but she sees land that's
as green and sweet

1024
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:03,579
as the ocean is salt and blue.

1025
01:24:03,579 --> 01:24:06,248
"England," one of the
sailors sang

1026
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:08,584
like a man sings to the
girl he loves.

1027
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:14,006
And the princess is so happy
at the sight of this land

1028
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,883
she starts to weep,
and the captain

1029
01:24:16,884 --> 01:24:19,887
he puts his hand on her
to send her back below

1030
01:24:19,887 --> 01:24:24,387
and she shouts,

1031
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:29,225
And that means, unhand
me, you indelicate rogue.

1032
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,857
I'm a personage of royal
blood that is bluer

1033
01:24:31,857 --> 01:24:34,901
than the deepest blue
of a sapphire.

1034
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:38,572
And she dived over the side
and swum strongly to shore.

1035
01:24:41,784 --> 01:24:43,452
You laughing at me, Mr. Gutch?

1036
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:49,416
- Not in the least, it's
very beautiful.

1037
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,337
Go on with it, please.

1038
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:57,549
- And when her tears had
dried so that she could see

1039
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,510
she saw England, a land
of unhappiness and misery.

1040
01:25:06,142 --> 01:25:07,935
The folks are
begging and hungry.

1041
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:14,066
The princess wandered
across the country

1042
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:17,486
from village to village,
and people was mostly kind

1043
01:25:17,486 --> 01:25:19,988
and fed her and gave
her shelter.

1044
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:24,201
But then she came to a village
where they reported her

1045
01:25:24,201 --> 01:25:27,245
for begging, but she
weren't begging, you see?

1046
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:31,792
'Cause princesses
don't ever beg.

1047
01:25:35,796 --> 01:25:38,590
Even when they're dying
of hunger they don't beg.

1048
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:46,515
So she done nothing wrong,
and that's the truth.

1049
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:51,270
I done nothing wrong,
not really.

1050
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:58,235
Not enough to be hanged for.

1051
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,573
- I'll do whatever I can
for you Mary, I promise.

1052
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,257
- Would you make sure that these
are delivered to Mr. Gutch?

1053
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:21,132
- Certainly ma'am.

1054
01:26:23,302 --> 01:26:24,094
- Thank you.

1055
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:52,205
- Ask him to wait in
the library.

1056
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:53,790
- He insists, madam.

1057
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,210
- Who insists?

1058
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:00,381
This is scandalous.
- It is.

1059
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:03,592
This is libel, and it can
and will be answered as such.

1060
01:27:03,592 --> 01:27:06,177
- I think not sir, it
proclaims a fraud

1061
01:27:06,178 --> 01:27:09,389
on the part of yourself and
other officers of the bank

1062
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,392
and you will answer it as such.

1063
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,435
- May I remind you I am
a magistrate?

1064
01:27:16,939 --> 01:27:18,398
- And these documents
prove that you have

1065
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,360
illegally issues bank
notes several times

1066
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,445
the value of your
bullion deposits.

1067
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,531
- Those documents are the
private and confidential

1068
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,032
property of the bank and
I demand to know

1069
01:27:27,032 --> 01:27:27,782
how you came by them.

1070
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:30,536
- I would have thought
it sufficient to know

1071
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:31,954
that they're in my possession.

1072
01:27:32,955 --> 01:27:37,455
But I have a proposal,
an exchange.

1073
01:27:37,626 --> 01:27:40,045
One fraud for another.

1074
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:55,519
- Mary, there's a ship
sailing on the morning tide

1075
01:27:55,519 --> 01:27:57,979
bound for America, and
you're to be on it.

1076
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:00,816
- Oh ma'am.

1077
01:28:00,816 --> 01:28:04,486
- Here are your clothes,
and 20 guineas.

1078
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:06,947
With this letter, apply
to the Moravian sisters

1079
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:09,240
when you arrive in Philadelphia.

1080
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:13,536
- Oh, thank you Mrs.
Worrall, I'll never forget

1081
01:28:13,537 --> 01:28:15,622
your kindness, never.

1082
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:19,626
- Don't thank me child,
you owe your deliverance

1083
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:24,127
to Mr. Gutch, and in a way,
I owe my deliverance to you.

1084
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:31,180
I wish you luck Mary.

1085
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:33,640
- Oh.

1086
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,527
- I wish you every
success and happiness

1087
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:47,238
in America, princess.

1088
01:28:50,407 --> 01:28:52,242
- Thank you Mr. Frixos.

1089
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:24,191
- Mr. Worrall, after 10
years of marriage

1090
01:29:24,191 --> 01:29:27,152
the time has come for me
to say enough is enough.

1091
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:30,738
I've arranged lodgings for
you in Bristol.

1092
01:29:32,032 --> 01:29:34,242
The servants will remain
with me, of course

1093
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:36,578
with the exception of Betty.

1094
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:39,957
You'll need a housekeeper.

1095
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,179
- Perhaps you'll write to me.

1096
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,932
I'd like to hear how
Princess Caraboo

1097
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:58,058
fares in the New World.

1098
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:05,941
- New World, it will
be a new world for me.

1099
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:10,612
Maybe I won't ever be
coming back.

1100
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:13,240
- Perhaps you will one day.

1101
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:18,787
- You might find your
way to America one day.

1102
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:19,579
Maybe.

1103
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,626
- I couldn't ask for
more than that.

1104
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:41,726
In a
way that I never expected

1105
01:30:41,727 --> 01:30:44,438
this girl had held out
her hand to me

1106
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:45,856
and now I was letting her go.

1107
01:31:12,174 --> 01:31:14,593
What are the chances for
love in a man's life?

1108
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:20,099
Very few, maybe one, and
I had not had the courage

1109
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:25,187
to declare myself,
instead the coward in me

1110
01:31:25,187 --> 01:31:27,689
had taken refuge in his safe,
dull life.

1111
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,448
- I'm just down to the pie
shop, do you want anything?

1112
01:31:36,448 --> 01:31:37,490
- No, thanks.

1113
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,579
This was my reality, I was a
printer, newspaper publisher

1114
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:51,083
and a man of supposed
responsibility, or was I?

1115
01:32:09,481 --> 01:32:12,692
- Head her at the point, Mr.
Marlowe.

1116
01:32:41,221 --> 01:32:43,389
- What language is that?

1117
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:47,890
- It's Irish, it means
there you are, here I am.

1118
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:22,512
- Mrs. Worrall, Mrs. Worrall,
have you seen the paper?

1119
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:25,641
- No, why?

1120
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:28,644
- Princess Caraboo entertained
by Napoleon Bonaparte.

1121
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:31,438
- No, no, can't be true.

1122
01:33:32,689 --> 01:33:33,564
- Read it, very good story.

1123
01:33:35,442 --> 01:33:37,986
- The ship carrying
Princess Caraboo to America

1124
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:40,279
was driven south by a
great tempest

1125
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,950
and passed close aboard
the island of Saint Helena.

1126
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,786
At her insistence the
princess was put ashore

1127
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:49,706
and presented to the emperor,
oh Frixos.

1128
01:33:49,706 --> 01:33:51,082
- There's more.

1129
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:53,001
- A week later, the
princess and Mr. Gutch

1130
01:33:53,001 --> 01:33:55,795
boarded a ship bound
for America.

1131
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:12,683
It's a very good
story, it it true do you think?
