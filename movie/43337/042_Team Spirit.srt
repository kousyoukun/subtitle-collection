1
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:07,758
Mike is a student at Woodlawn Elementary School.

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,053
He is in the fourth grade.

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:17,868
There are fifteen students in his class─seven girls and eight boys.

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:19,961
It is springtime.

5
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:23,023
The students love to play outside.

6
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,935
It's time to go to PE class.

7
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:29,983
Mr. Rabinovich is the PE teacher.

8
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:32,564
He is a very nice teacher.

9
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:36,621
He and the students are having class outside today.

10
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:40,769
It's too nice to play inside.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,624
"What are we going to play today?" the students ask.

12
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:50,641
"Whatever you kids want to play," Mr. Rabinovich says.

13
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,032
"It's your decision."

14
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,441
The girls decide they want to play soccer.

15
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:01,095
Seven boys decide they want to play baseball.

16
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:05,442
"It's all up to Mike," Mr. Rabinovich says.

17
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:10,541
"Do you want to play soccer or baseball, Mike?"

18
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:14,633
Mike, the eighth boy, looks at the other boys.

19
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,481
Then he looks at the girls.

20
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:22,071
"Well, I don't want to play baseball."

21
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:26,071
"Hooray!" the girls scream.

22
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:30,560
"And I don't want to play soccer," Mike says.

23
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:34,107
Everyone is quiet.

24
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:41,853
"You don't want to play baseball, and you don't want to play soccer?" Mr. Rabinovich asks.

25
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:46,639
"Well, Mike, what do you want to play?"

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,825
Mike looks at the girls.

27
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,819
They are not happy.

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,452
Then Mike looks at the boys.

29
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:55,947
They are not happy either.

30
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:59,640
"Come on, Mike," one of the boys says.

31
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,818
"Do you want to play baseball or soccer?"

32
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,973
"I want to play kickball," Mike says.

33
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:12,428
"You want to play kickball?" one of the girls asks.

34
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:15,186
"Yes," Mike says.

35
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:19,920
"That's stupid," one of the boys says.

36
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:24,588
"He can't choose kickball," one of the girls says.

37
00:02:24,589 --> 00:02:28,495
"He can only pick baseball or soccer."

38
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:31,321
The boys and girls start yelling.

39
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:37,511
Everyone is angry except for Mr. Rabinovich and Mike.

40
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:42,474
"Okay, that's enough yelling," Mr. Rabinovich says.

41
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,721
"We're going to play a game of kickball.

42
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:48,219
So pick your teams."

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,992
The students pick their teams.

44
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:56,619
There are three boys and four girls on one team.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,030
There are three girls and four boys on the other team.

46
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,935
Mike is the only student not on a team.

47
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:13,028
"We don't want him on our team," the team with three boys and four girls says.

48
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:17,709
"We don't want him either," the other team says.

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,543
"Now children," says Mr. Rabinovich.

50
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:26,132
"We asked Mike to choose a game to play.

51
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,748
He chose kickball.

52
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,899
Let him play too.

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,425
But Mike, next time, remember that you can't play what you want."

54
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:44,539
So Mr. Rabinovich joins one team and Mike joins the other.
