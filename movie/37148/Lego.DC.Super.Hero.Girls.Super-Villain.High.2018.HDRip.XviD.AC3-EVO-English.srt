(GRUNTING)

22
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,412
This is why
I'm a dog person.

23
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:16,116
(GRUNTING)

24

(GASPING)

27
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:36,132
Give up now, Batgirl.
You're whipped.

28
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:37,404
(SCREAMS AND GRUNTS)

(GROANING)

31
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:50,650
(YELPING)

32
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,283
That was embarrassing.

33
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,722
Especially because you could
have just flown above the ice.

34
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,595
Huh?

35
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,497
Pollen... (WHEEZING)
In the eyes.

36
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,399
(WHEEZING)
Super allergy attack.

37

(SNEEZES)

38
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:14,640
- (GROANS)
- Oh, sorry. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

39
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,780
When did these guys
get so good?

40
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:24,315
I don't know,
but we're better.

41
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,751
Come on, team. Let's
show 'em what we have.

42
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,855
Formation partner swap.

43
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:41,365
We're about to ruin
your purr-fect score.

44
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,233
Maybe, if you can hold on.

45
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,301
(WONDER WOMAN GRUNTS)

46
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,939
CATWOMAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,109
(YELPS)

48
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,880
Me... (GROANS) Ow.

49
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,614
Don't worry about losing, Jess.

50
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:59,349
We still have
a lot in common.

51
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,952
Like our love
of Opposite Direction.

52
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,752
That's not all
we have in common, Ivy.

53
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,722
I do have a green thumb.

54
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,490
Well, green everything.

55
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:08,195
(ROARING)

56
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:13,864
(GROWLING)

57
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,733
Would you look
at that?

58
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,634
Plants really do like
being talked to.

59
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,872
Don't talk! Attack! Attack!

60
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:29,716
How about you just cool your
heels for a while, Supergirl?

61
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,752
Heels? I prefer
sneakers.

62
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,222
But seriously,
your powers are so cool,

63
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,893
they almost blow me away.

64
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:45,029
(GROANING)

65
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:47,666
(ALARM RINGING)

66
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,107
Well, it looks like you
four are still undefeated.

67
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,775
Only by cheating.

68
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,509
They wouldn't have won if they
would have stuck to sparring

69
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,777
with their
original partners.

70
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,412
It's called
strategy, Cheetah.

71
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,514
I'd be happy to loan you some
of my books on the subject.

72
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:07,785
It might help during the
group sparring matches.

73
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,986
Yeah, thanks,
but no thanks.

74
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:12,889
There is no fair
in fighting, Cheetah.

75
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,491
You'd best learn
that lesson now

76
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,296
before some super-villain
decides to teach it to you.

77
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,033
Now, shake hands.

78
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:23,434
(GROWLS)

79
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:24,770
(SCOFFS)

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,642
Hmph.

81
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,510
Ivy, are we still down for the
Opposite Direction concert?

82
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:34,748
Of course.

83
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,948
Should we go
after them? Or...

84
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,917
I think they need
a moment.

85
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,451
It was a hard loss.

86
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,354
You all did
an amazing job.

87
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,821
Coach Wildcat
is right.

88
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,724
Wow, they've
really gotten better.

89
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,258
Maybe after
they calm down,

90
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,227
we could take them out
for smoothies or something.

91
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,528
Great idea, Supergirl.

92
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,830
In the meantime,

93
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,198
we're going to
have to start practicing

94
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,133
if we hope to keep
our undefeated title.

95
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,501
Coach Wildcat, can you
reset the sparring room?

96
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,273
Does Principal Waller
look like a drill instructor?

97
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,109
Uh...

98
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,342
(PHONE RINGING)

99
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,611
LENA: Eclipso, again? Ugh!

100
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,448
Take a hint! Ignored.

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,451
The only time anyone ever calls
me is to be their sidekick.

102
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,287
I am not a sidekick!

103
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,189
I'm Lena Luthor,

104
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,292
the greatest criminal mind
of my time!

105
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:23,296
(BEEPING)

106
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,799
(GASPS)

107
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,869
I'm through being
a B-list villain.

108
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,505
It's time to upgrade
my alphabetical standing.

109
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:38,311
It's time to really show
the world what I've got!

110
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,443
But how?

111
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:44,549
(GASPS) I know. I pinned some
really great ideas on Villaintrest.

112
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:47,017
Ooh! Plans to take over
the world!

113
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,719
I'd forgotten about these.

114
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,153
<i>Freeze ray? Boring.</i>

115
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,155
<i>Robot army? Meh.
Already tried that.</i>

116
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,424
<i>Harnessing the power
of the Amethyst from Gemworld?</i>

117
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,094
Done to death.

118
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:59,463
(GASPS) Ooh! Here's
something that could work.

119
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,165
Yes, yes! This could be big.

120
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,267
Huge even!

121
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,470
If I do this, Eclipso,
Brainiac, my brother,

122
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:11,309
even those do-gooders at Super Hero
High will cower at my villainous might!

123
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:12,842
But I can't do it alone.

124
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,378
I need some help.

125
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,813
But where?

126
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:19,052
Finding good help is
so hard these days.

127
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,820
I need cohorts in crime,
a legion.

128
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:27,023
(ALL CLAMORING)

129
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,025
What are you smiling at?

130
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,628
- (DISAPPOINTED MUTTERING)
- Don't you have something to wash or clean?

131
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,099
(DISAPPOINTED MUTTERING)

132
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,736
If I had only gone to Super
Hero High like I wanted to,

133
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:43,006
I could have made some like-minded
friends that could help me.

134
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,410
Say, that's it! Yes.

135
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,981
That will do nicely.
(LAUGHS INSIDIOUSLY)

136
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,417
Big Building Builders? Yeah.

137
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,018
I need something built. How big?

138
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,190
About the size of a school.

139
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,493
Atlantis?

140
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,027
Can you believe it?

141
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,330
Sea horse rides,
plankton farming.

142
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,698
This is
once in a lifetime,

143
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,165
bucket list type stuff!

144
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,001
I just entered
on a whim!

145
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,470
And I never
win anything!

146
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,506
Aside from that lifetime supply
of toe cream.

147
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,243
But really, is that winning?

148
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:21,044
I don't know if I can do this.

149
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:22,746
I'm not sure I'm ready.

150
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:25,982
Why do you think I picked you
to be my vice-principal?

151
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:29,820
Uh, hyper-intelligence
plus super strength?

152
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,354
Not even close.

153
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,823
It's because you
understand these kids

154
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,792
and you know
how the school works.

155
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,262
You're gonna
be great.

156
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,263
How will I contact you?

157
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:42,465
You can't. The cell reception
underwater is terrible!

158
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,034
But you'll be fine.

159
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,372
Remember, kids can smell fear
so try to stay strong.

160
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,607
"Principal Grodd."

161
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,076
Hmm.

162
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:56,014
Maybe a little power
wouldn't be so bad.

00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,400
Listen, I'd suggest
you girls keep being

493
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:54,369
the do-gooders
that you always are,

494
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:57,740
and let me worry about the less than
desirable members of our community.

495
00:23:57,742 --> 00:23:58,944
(YELPS)

496
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,410
They aren't less desirable,

497
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,380
they're our friends.

498
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,948
If you believe that, I don't think
you really knew them at all.

499
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,153
Now, if you'll excuse me...

500
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:17,929
(SIGHS) Close one.

501
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,363
Was that weird
for anyone else?

502
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,832
I don't know. I kinda thought
her hair looked nice.

503
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,702
No, I meant
the conversation.

504
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:28,337
You don't think she was right
about the other girls, do you?

505
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,840
No. I believe they're just
as good as you or me.

506
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,208
Let's go find them
and let them know

507
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,313
we stand behind them
no matter what.

508
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:41,117
FROST: <i>I can't believe they thought
I'd do something like that.</i>

509
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,718
I mean, freezing
the pipes?

510
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,553
That's so third grade.

511
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,488
(LAUGHS) You gotta admit,

512
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,090
it was pretty hysterical!

513
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,760
And itching powder!
Who does that?

514
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,227
I know!

515
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,196
Usually a good pepper
spray would work.

516
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:57,533
Honestly, they don't make itching
powder they way they used to.

517
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:00,069
And to think I need
help opening a lock.

518
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:02,938
Or I'd sent a plant
to attack a classmate.

519
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,340
Or that I'd fill the pool
with custard!

520
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:08,278
(GIGGLES) Oh, never mind.
I totally did that.

521
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,846
GIRL: <i>You know what I think?</i>

522
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,615
I think it was
those popular girls.

523
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:15,752
You know, Supergirl,
Batgirl, Wonder Woman.

524
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:17,887
- No, there's no way.
- She's probably right.

525
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,722
I don't like 'em but I don't
think they'd do that.

526
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:20,790
GIRL: <i>Think about it.</i>

527
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,158
<i>You five are
the up-and-comers.</i>

528
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,694
Who has more to lose

529
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,062
when you start beating them
at their best drills?

530
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:30,064
<i>We all know they're
super competitive.</i>

531
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,068
I even heard they cheated

532
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,670
during a group sparring match
you guys had together.

533
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:35,937
We were winning.

534
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,940
I haven't seen you
around here.

535
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:39,876
What did you say
your name was?

536
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:43,379
Divide. I was new here.

537
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,714
- Was?
- Yeah.

538
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:47,884
It's obvious that this place
is for losers.

539
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,719
Yeah, for losers.
Ha! Wait.

540
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,488
If you aren't going
to Super Hero High,

541
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,057
where are you going?

542
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,157
Haven't you heard?

543
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,561
There's a new school
in town.

544
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,029
Uber High.

545
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,430
Uber High?
Never heard of it.

546
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,499
At Uber High,

547
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,235
they're all about
letting you be you.

548
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,370
Less homework,
more fun.

549
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,005
I like
the sound of that.

550
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,141
Yeah, but what
about our friends?

551
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:14,776
What about them?
As far as I'm concerned,

552
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,312
you four are the only
friends I'll ever need.

553
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,014
Well, what are
you waiting for?

554
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:21,885
I think it's time you saw
you were missing.

555
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:24,353
Perfect! Let's go!

556
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:25,620
CATWOMAN: Then I laughed so hard

557
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:27,356
I spit out a hairball.

558
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:28,657
Literally.

559
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,826
Where are you guys going?

560
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:31,292
Like you care.

561
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:33,295
Yeah. We know what
you four are doing.

562
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:35,731
And we don't have to
stay here and take it.

563
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,433
You tell 'em, Frosty!

564
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:39,735
Doing? We aren't
doing anything.

565
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,503
In fact, we were
just coming to see

566
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,974
if there was anything
we could do to help.

567
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,574
I know something you can do.

568
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,610
What? We're your friends.
We'll do anything.

569
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,482
Good. Stay out of our way.

570
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,557
Uber High? Hmm.

571
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,024
Something smells funny.

572
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,660
And I intend to find out
what it is.

573

577
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,981
<i>Uber High actually didn't
exist until yesterday.</i>

578
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:27,884
The same day everything
started getting weird.

579
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,252
It looks like
it was funded

580
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,286
through several
dummy corporations.

581
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:33,022
Can you find
the original source?

582
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm Batgirl.
I can find anything.

583
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,926
<i>Bingo.</i>

584
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,195
<i>LexCorp!</i>

585
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:40,996
Lena's behind this?

586
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,265
What does she have
against Super Hero High?

587
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,500
She still holds a grudge

588
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:46,435
after not being allowed
to attend here.

589
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:49,405
So, what? She's getting back
at them by stealing students?

590
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:51,573
Hmm, maybe.
But I doubt it.

591
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,176
Lena never thinks small.

592
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:54,475
The only way we're
going to find out

593
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,311
what's going on
inside that school

594
00:27:56,313 --> 00:27:58,080
is to go
to the school ourselves.

595
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,884
But how? They know we'd never
leave Super Hero High.

596
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:03,785
Hmm, we need
someone new.

597
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,021
Someone that hasn't
been here long.

598

She's 25?

I didn't realize
she was that old.

Green Lantern,
you look great.

609
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,084
It's an expression.
It means she's perfect.

Aw, that's so sweet

Well, well, isn't it
the newest Green Lantern.

619

What brings you
to our new school?

620
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,177
Maybe she's tired
of being, like, what,

621
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,048
the tenth Green Lantern
at Super Hero High?

Second. Sheesh.

So, what is it, GL?
Why are you here?

624
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,052
Uh...

Stay calm.

Just tell them you thought
that they were right,

getting a fair shot.

Um, I just think
you guys were right.

they're so cool,

who I'm supposed to be

00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,478
Backlash, this is
Green Lantern.

651
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,478
She looks
really familiar.

652
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,084
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- You too.

653
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,251
(CRACKING) Ow!

654
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,785
Quite a grip
you have there.

655
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,091
<i>Oh, sorry. I learned it
in weightlifting.</i>

656
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:25,762
Lashina! That's why
she looked familiar.

657
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:27,730
Lashina, really?

658
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:31,067
Wow! She should totally wear her
hair like that all the time.

659
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,635
It looks really great.

660
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:33,735
It really does.

661
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:35,303
Really frames her face.

662
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,106
Well, nice to meet you.

663
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:38,774
Well, Green Lantern,

664
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,644
you've arrived just in time
for your first assignment.

665
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:44,746
Here at Uber High, we tend to
do things a bit differently.

666
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:48,217
We're more of a hands-on school,
learning through doing.

667
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:49,819
And our first exercise involves

668
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,554
helping the good people
at Project Cadmus.

669
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,490
Cadmus has asked us
to do them a favor

670
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,525
and test their security.

671
00:30:56,527 --> 00:31:00,530
<i>Our task is to infiltrate the
compound and find this object.</i>

672
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:01,897
If we're able
to obtain the object

673
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:03,866
and return to base
without being stopped,

674
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,167
you'll have passed.

675
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,368
<i>And you'll know
that you have the skills</i>

676
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,571
<i>to beat
the world's best security.</i>

677
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:11,206
So, who's ready
for a field trip?

678
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,774
(ALL CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

679
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:15,811
Good. Your transportation is
waiting outside.

680
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,446
Good hunting.

681
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:20,049
Finally, a chance to show
what we can really do.

682
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,817
Especially without
those good two shoes

683
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,484
next door
getting in the way.

684
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,487
All right, the bus is
waiting. Let's go!

685
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,322
- (BEEP)
- (WHISPERING) I'm assuming you three will be there

686
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:28,791

687
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,292
BATGIRL: <i>Don't worry,
Green Lantern,</i>

688
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:31,662
<i>you can count on us.</i>

689
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,965
Fools! By the time
these girls figure out

690
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,436
I'm using them to steal
ancient alien technology,

691
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,670
it will be too late for them

692
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:46,675
and the world.
(LAUGHS INSIDIOUSLY)

693
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:49,110
Principal Taller is
totally using our friends

694
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:51,045
to try and steal
that vase!

695
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,548
Yes, but why?

696
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,753
Maybe for an evil bouquet
of flowers?

697
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,587
We need to confront them.

698
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,353
They're our friends,
they'll listen.

699
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:00,889
And tell them what?

700
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,326
That their new school isn't
for super heroes,

701
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,263
it's for supervillains.

702
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,698
Magic is about give and take.

703
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,334
It's about seeing
that which is invisible

704
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,769
with the visible.

705
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:16,571
It's also about staying awake
in class.

706
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:17,973
- (SNORING)
- (BELL RINGING)

707
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:19,274

We slept through
our midterm?

715
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,124
No! That means...

716
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,458
We're failing!

717
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,927
I've never failed
at anything in my life.

718

Professor Fate!

719
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,530
Professor? Pssht.

720
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,398
I didn't go through
four years of magic school

721
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
to be called a professor.

722
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:47,770
Not to mention the debt
I'm carrying. Oi!

723
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:49,272
Please.

724
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,173
Call me Doctor.

725
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,642
Doctor Fate, there has to be
something we can do to make this up.

726
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,811
As much as I hate
to agree with Bumblebee,

727
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,417
she's right.
We'll do anything!

728
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,285
Hmm.

729
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:05,087
I see your problem
is not sleep

730
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,621
but something else.

731
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:10,024
Yes. I will help you
help yourself.

732

Follow me.

733
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,427
Did you understand
any of that?

734
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:13,797
Not a word.

735
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:20,168
Behold, your extra credit.

736
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,603
A globe?

737
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,338
Not just a globe,

738
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,007
but the Globe of Fate.

739
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,177
(ECHOING)

740
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:31,580
What does the Globe
of Fate do?

741
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,851
Place your hands
on the globe.

(BOTH GASP)

743
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,457

744
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,693
A necklace!

745
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:46,428
Yes, the necklace of Wotan.

746
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,630
It has been lost for centuries.

747
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:51,967
I sense this item will not only
help you pass your class,

748
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:56,304
but it will also help the school
in its time of greatest need.

Dramatic much?

750

So, how are we
supposed to find it?

751

You'll be there?

I'll be there first
and bring it back

get close.

This isn't
a party, Harley.

new school to commit crimes!

a little bit jealous

814
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:12,667

to help them

815

What's a mallet
going to do?

821
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,582
Distract you.

Oh, would you
look at that?

823
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:32,656
Beating on Supergirl's totally
gonna save us a ton of time!

00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:30,437
How about in here?

- <i>Wanted... Wanted... To talk.</i>
- (STATIC)

975
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:36,278
There's too much interference
in the computer room.

976
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,082
I can't maintain
our connection.

977
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:40,550
We've lost her.

978
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:42,917
Listen, Cheetah,

979
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,553
I've been in contact
with Wonder Woman,

980
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:46,789
Supergirl and Batgirl
this whole time.

981
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,055
They were right!

982
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:49,823
This school is
bought and paid for

983
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:51,225
by Lena Luthor.

984
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:52,528
We think she's
using everyone

985
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,963
to get this artifact
in order to...

986
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:56,798
Well, we don't
know why yet.

987
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,033
But generally,
you collect ancient artifacts

988
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:00,769
to rule the world.

989
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:02,073
So, my money is on that.

990
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,041
So, she was right.

991
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:09,044
- Who was right? (GASPS)
- TALLER: <i>Jessica Cruz.</i>

00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:12,049
A Green Lantern
through and through.

993
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:15,216
You knew? No!

994
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:16,550
You're being
brainwashed.

995
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:17,653
You must be.

996
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:19,220
There's no way
you'd do this.

997
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:20,622
Cheetah has
come to realize

998
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,593
that heroism is just
another word for sucker.

999
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:27,095
Lena! I knew it!

1000
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,662
Well, actually Batgirl knew it.

1001
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,497
But she's super smart,
so I totally believed her.

1002
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:33,669
Yes. Too clever
for your own good.

1003
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:34,669
That's right.

1004
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:36,370
In fact, my friends
are seeing

1005
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:38,606
everything that's happening
as we speak.

1006
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:40,108
They'll go
to the authorities

1007
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,010
and soon, you'll be
behind bars.

1008
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:45,146
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my dear.

1009
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:46,513
I deduced
you were working

1010
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:49,651
for those super happy
fun girls this whole time.

1011
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:51,352
In fact, I imagine
that you're wearing

1012
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,954
some sort of com device
on your purse

1013

in this very minute.

1014
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:55,657
An earpiece?

1015
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,660
Maybe a state of the art

(GASPS)

1017
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:02,463
Why do you think Cheetah
led you into this room?

1018
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,231
There is
an electromagnetic field

1019
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:08,102
that won't allow
any signals in or out.

1020
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:10,771
I'm afraid
you're on your own.

1021
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:13,140
Me? Against you two?

1022
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:14,843
You need better odds.

1023
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:16,845
We do. Boys.

My yellow Kryptomites tend

to bring out
a lot of fear in people.

1027
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:24,285
I imagine
a little fear isn't

1028
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,553
a problem for someone
such as yourself.

Oh, no, you don't.
I'm getting it!

Are you sure we're
in the right place?

1048
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,729
Yep. According to my intel
this is the stop.

1049

How long do you think
it takes to get to this rock?

In this thing,

probably an eternity.

it was a bullet train.

We're here.
Where are you?

So good of you

BATGIRL: (GASPS) The door!

We really have to start
being more careful.

You can
say that again.

1082
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:35,075
We really have to start
being more careful.

1083
00:49:35,077 --> 00:49:37,778
It's just a figure
of speech, Supergirl.

Oh.

1085
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:42,149
Wait, if Lena was
impersonating Green Lantern,

1086
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,887
then where is
Green Lantern?

1087
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:46,756
(GROANS) Right here.

Are you all right?

1090
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,062
I think so.

1091
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:55,830
Cheetah was helping Lena.

1092
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:58,166
She used
these Kryptomites.

1093

Well, except for the whole

I'm sure she doesn't know
what she's doing.

She's not always nice

1099
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:13,682
but she'd never turn evil.

1100
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:16,084
We'll never know unless
we can get out of here.

You're right, Jess.

1102
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:18,753
It'll take more than
a couple of bricks

1103
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:20,820
to keep us
contained. Supergirl.

The only thing that could
stop a punch from Supergirl.

00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,332
Magic.

1109
00:50:31,334 --> 00:50:32,733
Which would make sense.

1110
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:35,437
This whole place is
kind of magic central.

1111
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:36,738
Couldn't figure
that one out

1112
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,439
before I punched
the wall?

Sorry.

Unfinished business? Here?

1120
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:12,974
It doesn't matter.
What does matter is

1121
00:51:12,976 --> 00:51:16,309
that the jewels that we are
looking for are right there.

1122
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:17,678
We just need
to retrieve the gems

That can't have
good lumbar support.

If this guy is supposed
to be so smart,

why is there a giant brick

- This will teach you

1291
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,035
how to finish an objective,

1292
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:37,537
and prove once and for all

1293
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,039
that you are better
than your former classmates.

1294
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,876
Well, can't we do that without
having to break into the school?

1295
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:45,345
- Yes, we can.
- Cheetah.

1296
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:48,381
Coach Wildcat is always up
for some friendly competition.

1297
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:51,486
And I know you guys want
to see our friends again.

1298
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:53,586
Well, what if we challenge
Super Hero High

1299
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:55,122
to a sparring match?

1300
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:56,823
With everything we've learned,

1301
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:59,191
I bet we take down our former
classmates in no time.

1302
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:00,660
Good thinking, sugar!

1303
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:03,830
- (WHOOPING)
- Yes, I like that idea.

1304
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:05,332
What are you doing?

1305
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,834
While everyone's attention is
on the match,

1306
01:01:06,836 --> 01:01:09,535
no one will be watching
Doctor Fate's classroom.

1307
01:01:09,537 --> 01:01:11,204
Giving someone
the opportunity

1308
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:12,807
to nab the globe.

1309
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:16,242
You really are valedictorian
material, Cheetah.

1310
01:01:16,244 --> 01:01:18,080
Thank you,
Principal Taller.

1311
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,821
Hey! Coach Wildcat is
looking for you four.

1312
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,124
Coach Wildcat?

1313
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:31,658
We don't have time
for his shenanigans.

1314
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,126
No. That's perfect.

1315
01:01:33,128 --> 01:01:34,928
It's time to rope in
the teachers.

1316
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,062
We'll tell him what's going on

1317
01:01:36,064 --> 01:01:37,564
and he'll get Waller and Grodd.

1318
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:40,367
Then we can go to Uber High
and get our friends.

1319
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,037
Great idea.
Come on!

1320
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:45,573
Oh, thank you, Cyborg!

1321
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:47,475
That was nice of you
to relay the message.

1322
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:50,113
You're welcome, girls.
All in a day's work.

1323
01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:53,314
(SIGHS)

1324
01:01:53,316 --> 01:01:55,182
- Coach Wildcat!
- Lena Luthor brainwashed...

1325
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,383
SUPERGIRL: I'm starving!

1326
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:58,251
Girls, where have you been?

1327
01:01:58,253 --> 01:01:59,754
- Locked in a trap!
- Brainwashed!

1328
01:01:59,756 --> 01:02:02,021
- Fighting monsters!
- I'm still hungry!

1329
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:04,925
There'll be plenty of time to say
whatever it is you want to say later.

1330
01:02:04,927 --> 01:02:08,162
Right now, Principal Waller has
agreed to group sparring match

1331
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:10,100
with the girls from Uber High.

1332
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:13,334
You don't understand. We...

1333
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:15,205
- Three, two, one, go!
- (BUZZER BLARING)

1334
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:18,972
Catwoman, listen!

1335
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:20,073
We don't have to fight.

1336
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:21,642
Uber High is actually a front

1337
01:02:21,644 --> 01:02:23,811
for Lena Luthor's
nefarious plans.

1338
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:26,079
That's just a pile
of kitty litter.

1339
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:29,018
You're just jealous we're finally
getting the respect we deserve!

1340
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:54,809
Come on, Wondy,

1341
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:55,812
Stand still!

1342
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:05,251
Listen, Harley, Lena
Luthor is using you guys

1343
01:03:05,253 --> 01:03:06,954
to steal a bunch
of things for...

1344
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:08,622
Well, we don't know
that part yet.

1345
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:10,691
But we don't want to see
you guys get into trouble.

1346
01:03:10,693 --> 01:03:12,059
You have to believe us!

1347
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:13,760
Oh, I believe you.

1348
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:15,329
You do?

1349
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:17,030
Oh, I've known pretty
much from the start

1350
01:03:17,032 --> 01:03:18,399
something was
going on.

1351
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:20,468
But it sounded
like a fun time!

1352
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:21,471
(SIGHS)

1353
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:29,910
Catwoman, you and the other girls
are so good at what you do

1354
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:32,379
that we have to work really
hard just to keep up.

1355
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:34,314
You girls make us
better heroes.

1356
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,983
We don't just respect you,

1357
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,454
we need you.

1358
01:03:38,354 --> 01:03:40,419
- Really?
- Really.

1359
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:43,524
You know, you aren't
so bad... For a bat.

1360
01:03:43,526 --> 01:03:46,262
And you're not
so terrible for a cat.

1361
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:50,800
Leave me alone!

1362
01:03:53,135 --> 01:03:55,669
(SOBBING)

1363
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:58,705
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tree, really.
- No!

1364
01:03:58,707 --> 01:03:59,740
Are you okay?

1365
01:03:59,742 --> 01:04:01,941
This is what happens
when friends fight.

1366
01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:03,343
Other people get hurt.

1367
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:05,479
You're right.
I never wanted to.

1368
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:06,747
But there was
this girl,

1369
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,981
and she said
you guys hated us.

1370
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:11,619
Hated you? I can
never hate you!

1371
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:13,120
We love you guys,

1372
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:16,157
which is why we've been chasing
you down all over the globe.

1373
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:17,356
We miss you,

1374
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,191
and we wanna
make sure you're okay.

1375
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:22,930
- SUPERGIRL: (SOBBING) Oh, I'm sorry.
- I know, I'm sorry!

1376
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:26,401
(BOTH SOBBING)

1377
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:33,707
So, decided to go back
over to Super Hero High?

1378
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:37,278
If by "decided", you mean Cheetah
and Lena Luthor knocked me out

1379
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,180
and left us for dead
in the Rock of Eternity,

1380
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:41,384
then yeah!

1381
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:45,017
What? You're lying!

1382
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:48,622
If I'm lying, where's Cheetah
and Principal Taller?

1383
01:04:48,624 --> 01:04:51,160
You know, you might be right.

1384
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:55,465
Let's do this together.

1385
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,566
What in tarnation
are you doing?

1386
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,102
The match isn't over!

1387
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:04,604
There hasn't even been
one good knockout yet!

1388
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,807
Coach, I think
we've made a mistake.

1389
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:10,376
Yeah. We don't wanna
fight our friends anymore.

1390
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:12,379
Plus, we think
that Principal Taller is

1391
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:14,247
actually Lena Luthor
in disguise.

1392
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:16,885
She's here to steal something
from Doctor Fate's classroom.

1393
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:26,492
Well, it looks like we might
get that knockout after all.

1394
01:05:26,494 --> 01:05:28,896
What are you waiting for?
Go save the day!

1395
01:05:28,898 --> 01:05:31,198
Yeah, let's go!

1396
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,402
Yeah!

Principal Waller? I...

1400
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,682
What? Why are you and
Cheetah in the magic class?

1401
01:05:47,684 --> 01:05:50,916
Not that I need
to answer to you, Batgirl,

1402
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:53,454
but I was showing
these girls our facilities,

1403
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:55,455
trying to persuade them
to re-enroll.

1404
01:05:55,457 --> 01:05:57,457
Oh, that makes sense.

1405
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,091
Now if you'll excuse me,

1406
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,827
I'd like
to continue my tour.

1407
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:01,930
I don't buy it!

1408
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:06,535
And people say
I'm the crazy one!

Of course, they were.

1412
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,044
Annoyingly, they always are.

1413

But it's too late.

1414

And I'm Lashina!

1415

- Meh.

Enough! Boys!

Keep them back
while I finish this.

1419
01:06:30,258 --> 01:06:35,028
At last. The final piece
of my master plan.

1420
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,497
What? To start
a jewelry store?

1421
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:39,602
Nothing so mundane.

I know she's evil
and all...

1423
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:53,412
But that is awesome!

1424
01:06:53,414 --> 01:06:55,416
(CHUCKLES) It is awesome.

1425
01:06:55,418 --> 01:06:57,218
But not awesome enough.

1426
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,718
You girls unwittingly helped me

1427
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,220
steal a series
of ancient power supplies

1428
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:04,992
that will make me unstoppable.

1429
01:07:04,994 --> 01:07:06,693
So, what was the vase for?

1430
01:07:06,695 --> 01:07:09,428
An evil bouquet of flowers, duh!

anything about that!

1442
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,557
Is she still
brainwashing you?

1443
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,827
Brainwashing...

Uh, yes!

1445
01:07:42,164 --> 01:07:45,465
I must have been under
some sort of mind control!

We'll fill you in later but for
now, we have bigger problems.

1448
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:54,374
The power... I can feel it
coursing through my veins!

1449
01:07:54,376 --> 01:07:55,678
Come on, girls!

1450
01:07:57,211 --> 01:07:58,611
(GROANS)

1451
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,579
Thank you, Supergirl.

1452
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,883
I was looking
for a little super-strength!

1453
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:08,090
(GROANS) My strength!
It's... fading!

1454
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:14,896
What are you doing? No!
(GRUNTS) Stop!

1455
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,733
Hold on, Ivy!

1456
01:08:20,603 --> 01:08:22,438
How chilling.

1457
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,909
She's absorbing
everyone's powers!

1458
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:30,275
What can we do?

1459
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,745
We've all been fighting
against each other for so long,

1460
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:34,448
we haven't gotten anywhere!

1461
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,717
What happens
when we fight together?

1462
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,485
Super Hero High School rules
on three!

1463
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:44,291
One, two,
Super Hero High School rules!

1464
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:46,092
I have an idea. Follow me!

1465
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,497
Retreating? So soon?

1466
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,902
You girls go ahead.
We'll distract them.

1467
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:01,475
What is that? Is that...

1468
01:09:01,477 --> 01:09:03,276
Sounds like motors.

1469
01:09:03,278 --> 01:09:05,013
(ENGINES REVVING)

1470
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,799
Who needs superpowers
when you've got these? Yahoo!

1471
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,803
Okay, Frost! Soften her up!

1472
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,041
(LAUGHS) Snowballs? Now that
Lena has Supergirl's strength,

1473
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:36,746
you're gonna need
to do better than that.

1474
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:39,916
Ivy, grab a hold!

1475
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:43,851
What are you doing?

1476
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:46,118
Okay, Harley.
Do your thing!

1477
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,656
With pleasure!

1478
01:09:51,393 --> 01:09:54,159
Pliers, finish her off!

1479
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:56,798
All right, team.
Let's pull her over!

1480
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:03,806
- (GRUMBLES)
- It's over, Lena!

1481
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:09,778
Over? It's just beginning.

1482
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:13,680
The necklace. Yes!

1483
01:10:13,682 --> 01:10:15,649
This was the final piece.

1484
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:17,316
What is that?

1485
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:18,985
The necklace of Wotan.

1486
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:21,053
Doctor Fate told us
to retrieve it.

1487
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:23,757
He said that it was an
object of unlimited power,

1488
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:25,758
and help the school
in its hour of need.

1489
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,596
Yes. Yes! I can feel it!

1490
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:32,168
(YELPS) Wait!
What is it doing?

1491
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:35,804
Looks like
Doctor Fate was right.

1492
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:41,374
My strength is returning.

1493
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:42,708
So are my powers!

1494
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,909
HARLEY: <i>Mine too!</i>

1495
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,546
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

1496
01:10:46,548 --> 01:10:48,382
What? The power
of laughter.

1497
01:10:48,384 --> 01:10:50,883
Well, I guess it's all
is well that ends well.

1498
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:53,921
Bah! You think I don't
have contingencies?

1499
01:10:53,923 --> 01:10:57,626
Lena Luthor always has
a backup plan!

1500
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:10,937
Now no longer will we be
called Uber High,

1501
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:16,144
but the home base
for the Legion of Doom!

1502
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:25,955
(ALL GASP)

1503
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:30,989
A giant flying ship?

1504
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:32,493
- Been there.
- Done that.

1505
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:33,829
Will do it again.

1506
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:41,802
After you.

1507
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:43,203
No, no. I insist.

1508
01:11:43,205 --> 01:11:47,141
- No, please.
- Oh, come on!

1509
01:11:47,143 --> 01:11:50,677
A little friendly competition
never hurt no one.

1510
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,648
That's one for me!

1511
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:00,686
BUMBLEBEE: One for me too!

1512
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:02,157
KATANA: Me three!

1513
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:08,127
FROST: <i>You can't hit
what you can't see!</i>

1514
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,998
Huh? What? No!

1515
01:12:24,745 --> 01:12:26,281
Now, everyone up!

1516
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:36,826
WONDER WOMAN: <i>Round
and round she goes!</i>

1517
01:12:38,093 --> 01:12:41,363
Where she stops,
nobody knows!

1518
01:12:47,503 --> 01:12:49,369
(ALL CHEERING)

1519
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:52,338
Shouldn't you girls be
in class?

1520
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:55,141
Lena? Not this time, lady!

1521
01:12:55,143 --> 01:12:56,809
- (YELPS)
- WONDER WOMAN: No, Supergirl!

1522
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:58,945
That's the real
Principal Waller!

1523
01:12:58,947 --> 01:13:02,082
Oh. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Sorry.

1524
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:03,615
I don't know
what's going on

1525
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:06,185
butt I want some
answers right now!

1526
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:08,387
It's my fault,
Principal Waller!

1527
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:11,257
I was teaching them
the virtues of competition

1528
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:12,958
here in the open air!

1529
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,694
But what I found out is

1530
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:16,896
that while competition is good,

1531
01:13:16,898 --> 01:13:20,100
it's not as good as learning
to work together.

1532
01:13:20,102 --> 01:13:22,636
Very well. But from
now on, please keep

1533
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:25,341
these little sparring
matches in the gymnasium.

1534
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:29,642
You heard the lady.

1535
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:32,078
Who's up for a little
group sparring match!

1536
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,815
Sure. But maybe this time,
we'll mix up the teams.

1537
01:13:35,817 --> 01:13:38,051
That's a great idea!

1538
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:41,954
I bet I can make even more
off a rematch!

1539
01:13:41,956 --> 01:13:43,356
I'll take that bet.

1540
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:45,190
- Hey!
- And I'll take that money!

1541
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:48,194
Uh, I was totally gonna
give that to you.

1542
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:50,065
Honest! (SCREAMS)

1543
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:56,772
(ALARMS BEEPING)

1544
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:08,347
Well, that didn't go as planned.
What do we do now?

1545
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:11,217
What you always do
with an empty base.

1546
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:14,421
Fill it. Bring me my Rolodex!

1547
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:15,689
What's a Rolodex?

1548
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:17,858
(SIGHS) Never mind.

1549
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,124
Kids.

1550
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,860
I'll just log on
to Villainbook.

1551
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:22,794
I'm sure someone is
looking to team up.

1552
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:23,997
I can team up.

1553
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,865
We are teamed up.
We need more people.

1554
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,568
LASHINA: <i>I know people.</i>

1555
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,169
- LENA: <i>Dumb people.</i>
- LASHINA: <i>What did you say?</i>

1556
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:33,142
LENA: (GROANS) <i>I'm doomed!</i>
