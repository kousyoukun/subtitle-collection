20
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,473
<i>You'll have to do
better than that, Amazon.</i>

21
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,412
This is why
I'm a dog person.

22
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:36,132
Give up now, Batgirl.
You're whipped.

23
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,283
That was embarrassing.

24
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,722
Especially because you could
have just flown above the ice.

25
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,595
Huh?

26
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,497
Pollen...
In the eyes.

27
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,399
Super allergy attack.

28
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh, sorry.

29
00:02:20,546 --> 00:02:22,780
When did these guys
get so good?

30
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:24,315
I don't know,
but we're better.

31
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,751
Come on, team. Let's
show 'em what we have.

32
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,855
Formation partner swap.

33
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:41,365
We're about to ruin
your purr-fect score.

34
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:43,233
Maybe, if you can hold on.

35
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,939
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,880
Me... Ow.

37
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,614
Don't worry about losing, Jess.

38
00:02:57,616 --> 00:02:59,349
We still have
a lot in common.

39
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,952
Like our love
of Opposite Direction.

40
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,752
That's not all
we have in common, Ivy.

41
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,722
I do have a green thumb.

42
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,490
Well, green everything.

43
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,733
Would you look
at that?

44
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,634
Plants really do like
being talked to.

45
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,872
Don't talk! Attack! Attack!

46
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:29,716
How about you just cool your
heels for a while, Supergirl?

47
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:35,752
Heels? I prefer
sneakers.

48
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,222
But seriously,
your powers are so cool,

49
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,893
they almost blow me away.

50
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,107
Well, it looks like you
four are still undefeated.

51
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,775
Only by cheating.

52
00:03:57,777 --> 00:03:59,509
They wouldn't have won if they
would have stuck to sparring

53
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,777
with their
original partners.

54
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,412
It's called
strategy, Cheetah.

55
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,514
I'd be happy to loan you some
of my books on the subject.

56
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:07,785
It might help during the
group sparring matches.

57
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,986
Yeah, thanks,
but no thanks.

58
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:12,889
There is no fair
in fighting, Cheetah.

59
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,491
You'd best learn
that lesson now

60
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,296
before some super-villain
decides to teach it to you.

61
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,033
Now, shake hands.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,642
Hmph.

63
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,510
Ivy, are we still down for the
Opposite Direction concert?

64
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:34,748
Of course.

65
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,948
Should we go
after them? Or...

66
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,917
I think they need
a moment.

67
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,451
It was a hard loss.

68
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,354
You all did
an amazing job.

69
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,821
Coach Wildcat
is right.

70
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,724
Wow, they've
really gotten better.

71
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:48,258
Maybe after
they calm down,

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,227
we could take them out
for smoothies or something.

73
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,528
Great idea, Supergirl.

74
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,830
In the meantime,

75
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,198
we're going to
have to start practicing

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,133
if we hope to keep
our undefeated title.

77
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,501
Coach Wildcat, can you
reset the sparring room?

78
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:01,273
Does Principal Waller
look like a drill instructor?

79
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:03,109
Uh...

80
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,611
Eclipso, again? Ugh!

81
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,448
Take a hint! Ignored.

82
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,451
The only time anyone ever calls
me is to be their sidekick.

83
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,287
I am not a sidekick!

84
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,189
I'm Lena Luthor,

85
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,292
the greatest criminal mind
of my time!

86
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,869
I'm through being
a B-list villain.

87
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,505
It's time to upgrade
my alphabetical standing.

88
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:38,311
It's time to really show
the world what I've got!

89
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,443
But how?

90
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:44,549
I know. I pinned some
really great ideas on Villaintrest.

91
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:47,017
Ooh! Plans to take over
the world!

92
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,719
I'd forgotten about these.

93
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,153
<i>Freeze ray? Boring.</i>

94
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,155
<i>Robot army? Meh.
Already tried that.</i>

95
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:54,424
<i>Harnessing the power
of the Amethyst from Gemworld?</i>

96
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:56,094
Done to death.

97
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:59,463
Ooh! Here's
something that could work.

98
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,165
Yes, yes! This could be big.

99
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,267
Huge even!

100
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:06,470
If I do this, Eclipso,
Brainiac, my brother,

101
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:11,309
even those do-gooders at Super Hero
High will cower at my villainous might!

102
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:12,842
But I can't do it alone.

103
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,378
I need some help.

104
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,813
But where?

105
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:19,052
Finding good help is
so hard these days.

106
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,820
I need cohorts in crime,
a legion.

107
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:29,025
What are you smiling at?

108
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,628
Don't you have something to wash or clean?

109
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,736
If I had only gone to Super
Hero High like I wanted to,

110
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:43,006
I could have made some like-minded
friends that could help me.

111
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,410
Say, that's it! Yes.

112
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,981
That will do nicely.

113
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,417
Big Building Builders? Yeah.

114
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,018
I need something built. How big?

115
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,190
About the size of a school.

116
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,493
Atlantis?

117
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,027
Can you believe it?

118
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,330
Sea horse rides,
plankton farming.

119
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,698
This is
once in a lifetime,

120
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,165
bucket list type stuff!

121
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,001
I just entered
on a whim!

122
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,470
And I never
win anything!

123
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,506
Aside from that lifetime supply
of toe cream.

124
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,243
But really, is that winning?

125
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:21,044
I don't know if I can do this.

126
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:22,746
I'm not sure I'm ready.

127
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:25,982
Why do you think I picked you
to be my vice-principal?

128
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:29,820
Uh, hyper-intelligence
plus super strength?

129
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,354
Not even close.

130
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:32,823
It's because you
understand these kids

131
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,792
and you know
how the school works.

132
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,262
You're gonna
be great.

133
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,263
How will I contact you?

134
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:42,465
You can't. The cell reception
underwater is terrible!

135
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,034
But you'll be fine.

136
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:46,372
Remember, kids can smell fear
so try to stay strong.

137
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,607
"Principal Grodd."

138
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,076
Hmm.

139
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:56,014
Maybe a little power
wouldn't be so bad.

140
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:58,582
Five days of no kids,

141
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:01,150
no schools and no plots
to take over the world!

142
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:04,587
Oh, happy day!
Oh, happy day!

143
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,155
Hi, Principal Waller.

144
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:08,893
Hello, student
I don't recognize

145
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,794
and goodbye!

146
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,999
Enjoy your vacation.

147
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:18,001
No. Make sure
the ship gets lost

148
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:21,241
somewhere between Bermuda
and the Mariana Trench.

149
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,277
Principal Waller, I thought...

150
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,381
I was just
testing the chair.

151
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,549
Don't grovel, Grodd.
It's unbecoming.

152
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,216
I've decided the trip
to Atlantis

153
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:35,619
wouldn't be in the
student'' best interest.

154
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,387
There is still so much
to do around campus.

155
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,623
Is there anything
I can help with?

156
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,193
Yes, there is.

157
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:42,893
Leave.

158
00:08:42,895 --> 00:08:44,097
Huh?

159
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,198
Today, please.

160
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,174
Step one.

161
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:58,977
All right, you know
what to do.

162
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:16,158
Oh, you guys missed it!

163
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,761
Supergirl, Wonder Woman,
Batgirl,

164
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:20,663
and the new Green Lantern put
the hurt on Cheetah and her gang

165
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:21,898
during group sparring!

166
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,303
It was intense!

167
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,970
Both groups
lacked discipline.

168
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:28,538
If I were to participate,

169
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,705
I doubt
anyone would last

170
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,041
more than
a few minutes.

171
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:32,308
That's a lot of talk
from someone

172
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,945
whose only superpower
is a sword.

173
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:36,412
A sword?

174
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,215
This is much more
than a sword. It's a...

175
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:39,082
Sword!

176
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,185
And you, Fly Girl?

177
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,552
You think you'd fare
better against me?

178
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:45,989
Think? I know.

179
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:49,627
No one can stop
the bodacious Bumblebee!

180
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:53,129
Gee! Maybe you two should see
who would win in a competition.

181
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,332
Maybe during a game
of, I don't know...

182
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,200
Hyperfly?

183
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:59,002
- Deal!
- Deal!

184
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,071
It's almost too easy.

185
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:04,407
<i>Come see
the blistering Bumblebee</i>

186
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,143
<i>take on
the karate-kicking Katana</i>

187
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:10,214
in the match to match
all matches!

188
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:12,986
Only five dollars to watch.

189
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:39,575
Wow, this is awesome.

190
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:41,945
How long do these
matches usually last?

191
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:43,448
Oh, about half an hour.

192
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,292
Huh?

193
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,130
Ooh.

194
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,105
I admit, you are better
than I thought.

195
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:10,941
Does that mean you concede?

196
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,475
Hardly.

197
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,311
I only thought to give you
the chance to surrender

198
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,279
before I beat you mercilessly.

199
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,681
Bring it on, Can't-ana!

200
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,518
Will you make sure you
lock up when you leave?

201
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,522
Thanks.

202
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:31,394
Often times,

203
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,830
you'll be in a position
where you'll need to escape

204
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:36,133
an evil doer's insane
yet inventive death trap.

205
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:38,301
It takes a sharp mind, patience.

206
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,902
And that's why today,

207
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:42,138
we're having a lock quiz.

208
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,706
<i>The first person
to pick the lock</i>

209
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,942
<i>with nothing more
than a paper clip passes.</i>

210
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:47,576
What about the others?

211
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:48,845
They fail.

212
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:50,346
That doesn't seem fair.

213
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:53,216
Fair? Try marching
through the jungles

214
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:56,853
with 50 pounds of blood,
sweat and tears on your back

215
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,321
while animals and enemies

216
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:01,859
lie in wait for you
to make one fatal mistake!

217
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,426
Then you can come back to me

218
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:06,765
and talk about fair!

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,635
Professor Oberon,
are you okay?

220
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,639
I'll never be okay.

221
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,209
A word of advice, kids.

222
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,676
Never join a circus.

223
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:19,877
Never.

224
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,043
Join.

225
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:22,247
A circus.

226
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,450
Now where was I?

227
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,587
Ready, set, go.

228
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:35,060
Huh?

229
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:46,405
Perfect!

230
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:51,077
Well, it looks like
we have a winner.

231
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:54,746
Huh?

232
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:00,917
A skeleton key?

233
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,555
What? No!
That's not mine!

234
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:09,058
I don't tolerate cheating
in my class, Catwoman.

235
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,762
You think they let
you cheat out there

236
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,765
in the jungle?

237
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:15,898
But this is
just a quiz.

238
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,301
Same difference.

239
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,335
Report to the principal's office
this instant.

240
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,604
But it wasn't mine!

241
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,606
Mm-mm.

242
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,444
Hmph!

243
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,085
I guess that means
you win, Batgirl.

244
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:36,085
Let that be a lesson, students.

245
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,922
Cheaters never prosper.

246
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:48,533
Nothing like a warm shower
to start the day.

247
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,656
So cold. So cold!

248
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:13,856
Who did this?

249
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,898
Why, yes. You are right, Frost.

250
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,737
Ice cream is the most
important meal of the day.

251
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,343
Frost!

252
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:37,150
To the principal's office, now!

253
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:38,750
Huh?

254
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,287
So, Wondy.

255
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,956
I heard you were
made out of mud.

256
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,861
So I'm sure you'll be
fine eating my dust.

257
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:00,771
Dandruff? Ew!

258
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,942
I guess I need
to switch up my conditioner.

259
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,612
<i>Come around to the starting line!</i>

260
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,720
You better
not have fleas.

261
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:19,023
Oh!

262
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:21,858
Sorry.

263
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,061
Oh, good. Something I'm used
to chasing.

264
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:29,532
<i>On your mark,</i>

265
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:32,438
<i>get set, go!</i>

266
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,209
Come get me!
Come get me!

267
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:46,782
My hair! Ow!

268
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:49,521
Took me long enough.

269
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:56,159
Yes! Who's the best?

270
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:58,228
I am. I am.

271
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,629
All right.

272
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,831
Get your gear and head
to the locker room.

273
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,266
Say, um,

274
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:05,002
what do you think is going
on with Wonder Woman?

275
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,373
I swear, I do not
have fleas.

276
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:28,358
Wonder Woman,
are you okay?

277
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,494
Maybe she decided
to take up swimming

278
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:32,662
since she's no good at track.

279
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:34,531
I don't know
what happened.

280
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,899
My head would
not stop itching.

281
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:37,902
Sure.

282
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,045
<i>Itching powder?</i>

283
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,411
Oh, come on!

284
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:50,380
That doesn't seem
like you, Cheetah.

285
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,648
- Because it wasn't.
- Sure.

286
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,553
Tell it to the principal.

287
00:16:58,222 --> 00:16:59,422
You know
what they say,

288
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,894
Cheetahs never prosper.

289
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,242
I don't get it.

290
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:20,778
There has to be
more to this.

291
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,616
Everyone would
totally recognize me.

292
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:29,519
Delivery for Supergirl.

293
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,587
I'm Supergirl.

294
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:32,388
Ah, sure you are.

295
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,390
No, seriously.
Can you get her, please?

296
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:35,757
But I am Supergirl!

297
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,427
Ma'am, I'm a professional.

298
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,196
Everyone knows Supergirl
doesn't wear glasses.

299
00:17:40,198 --> 00:17:43,399
Huh. Go figure. One second.
I'll get her.

300
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:45,467
Oh, hi! You have
a delivery for me?

301
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,439
Yeah, Supergirl.
Just sign right here.

302
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:03,285
"No hard feelings about earlier.

303
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:05,988
"Your friend, Poison Ivy."

304
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,392
Aw, that is so sweet!

305
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:10,959
I'm totally going to make her

306
00:18:10,961 --> 00:18:13,362
some of Ma Kent's
famous organic corn ice cream.

307
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,799
She's just the sweetest.

308
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,071
Monster plant!

309
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:23,109
<i>Monster plant!</i>

310
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:30,045
It's time for your driver's test, Ms.
Lantern.

311
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,613
I trust you're ready.

312
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:34,184
I was
born ready.

313
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:37,454
Isn't it true
humans are born not ready?

314
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,755
That is what my creator...

315
00:18:38,757 --> 00:18:41,457
Figure of speech,
Professor Tornado.

316
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,627
Oh, yes. Of course.

317
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:46,061
Ha, ha, ha.

318
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:48,264
So, Ms. Lantern,
it is required

319
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,367
that in order for you
to get your license

320
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,269
you must
have a vehicle.

321
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,370
I do not
see yours here.

322
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,141
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

323
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:02,779
All right. Seatbelts.

324
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,546
- Safety first.
- Very good.

325
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,585
Now, pull out slowly
and check for traffic.

326
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,522
Supergirl!

327
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:14,390
Too fast. Too fast!

328
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,562
Sorry, Prof.
My friends need me!

329
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,403
Well, at least
she left the seat.

330
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,972
Oof!

331
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:30,042
Fail.

332
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:41,551
Jessica? Aren't you supposed
to be at your driver's test?

333
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,653
Yeah. I think I failed.

334
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,155
Oh, I'm sorry!

335
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,124
It's okay.
On the plus side,

336
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,961
I still have
my pilot's license.

337
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:05,177
Yield.

338
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,612
Never.

339
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,888
Lucky that thing ain't
the hyperfly ball.

340
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,255
It was only a matter of
time before you lost to me.

341
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:23,426
Unlikely! I was actually
using my bad arm to play.

342
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:24,726
If I had used
my good arm...

343
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,196
Ladies!

344
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,265
A little help here!

345
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:34,907
One, two, ha!
I'm already in the lead.

346
00:20:35,373 --> 00:20:36,574
Lead?

347
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,644
You were in the lead.

348
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,749
Huh? Whoa!

349
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,588
Nice catch!

350
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,659
Thanks. Now,
what about this plant?

351
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,526
Thirty two, thirty three!

352
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:00,663
Wait, I know! Plants need
water to survive, right?

353
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:03,601
Right. Oh! I get it.

354
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,776
I think it's working.

355
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:18,481
Where there's a wilt,
there's a way.

356
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,015
Who did this?

357
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:23,319
Um, I thought Poison Ivy
was giving me a present,

358
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,090
but instead...

359
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,227
Ivy, huh?

360
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:33,966
Fifty two!

361
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,131
Fifty two!

362
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:39,601
Uh, question.

363
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:40,735
Why am I here?

364
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:43,106
When are you not here?

365
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,209
Good point.

366
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:45,775
All of you have been
caught breaching

367
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:48,444
the Super Hero High
school code of conduct.

368
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:53,849
Enough.

369
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,251
None of you have
lived up to the potential

370
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,186
we hoped for
when you arrived.

371
00:21:57,188 --> 00:21:58,955
<i>I wonder</i>

372
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:01,291
if this school isn't for you.

373
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,824
That's not very funny.

374
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:05,494
Are you kicking
us out?

375
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:06,763
I'm not sure.

376
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,264
But I suggest
you seriously think

377
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:11,201
about if this is
the best school for you.

378
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,038
Now, dismissed.

379
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:23,248
Just another little push
should do the trick.

380
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:27,449
Cheetah, I was just coming
to tell Principal Waller.

381
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:28,784
I didn't actually think...

382
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:31,120
Save it, W.
You've done enough.

383
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:32,323
Come on, girls!

384
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:35,124
See you later, Ivy?

385
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:36,792
Not really feeling
up to it.

386
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:38,096
Maybe another time.

387
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:42,165
They look really angry.

388
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,635
You know,
maybe they need a hug.

389
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:47,136
Little known fact,
I give super hugs.

390
00:22:47,138 --> 00:22:49,039
I'm sure
you do, Supergirl.

391
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,741
But right now, we need to
talk to Waller about this.

392
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,679
Something strange
is going on.

393
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:03,986
Principal Waller,
are you here?

394
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,521
Yes. Uh...

395
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:08,891
But I'm looking
for some very important files.

396
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,792
What do you want?

397
00:23:10,794 --> 00:23:14,598
We just saw Cheetah, Frost, Poison Ivy
and Catwoman coming from your office.

398
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,432
And Harley.

399
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:18,334
Yeah, not so weird.

400
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:20,404
All the stuff
that's happened today,

401
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,004
it's not really like them.

402
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,005
We think something else
is going on.

403
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:26,475
<i>I understand
your concern.</i>

404
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,578
Come on, work!

405
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,213
But I think we've been indulging

406
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:33,449
the fantasy that they are
Super Hero High material

407
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:35,984
for far too long.

408
00:23:35,986 --> 00:23:37,753
Ah, there we go.

409
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,323
That's a... Um...

410
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:44,195
Unique hairstyle
you have there.

411
00:23:45,396 --> 00:23:48,898
Oh! Uh, I'm just trying
something different.

412
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,400
Listen, I'd suggest
you girls keep being

413
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:54,369
the do-gooders
that you always are,

414
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:57,740
and let me worry about the less than
desirable members of our community.

415
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:02,410
They aren't less desirable,

416
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,380
they're our friends.

417
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,948
If you believe that, I don't think
you really knew them at all.

418
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,153
Now, if you'll excuse me...

419
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:17,929
Close one.

420
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:21,363
Was that weird
for anyone else?

421
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:23,832
I don't know. I kinda thought
her hair looked nice.

422
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,702
No, I meant
the conversation.

423
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:28,337
You don't think she was right
about the other girls, do you?

424
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,840
No. I believe they're just
as good as you or me.

425
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,208
Let's go find them
and let them know

426
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,313
we stand behind them
no matter what.

427
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:41,117
<i>I can't believe they thought
I'd do something like that.</i>

428
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,718
I mean, freezing
the pipes?

429
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,553
That's so third grade.

430
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,488
You gotta admit,

431
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,090
it was pretty hysterical!

432
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,760
And itching powder!
Who does that?

433
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:52,227
I know!

434
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,196
Usually a good pepper
spray would work.

435
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:57,533
Honestly, they don't make itching
powder they way they used to.

436
00:24:57,535 --> 00:25:00,069
And to think I need
help opening a lock.

437
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:02,938
Or I'd sent a plant
to attack a classmate.

438
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,340
Or that I'd fill the pool
with custard!

439
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:08,278
Oh, never mind.
I totally did that.

440
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,846
<i>You know what I think?</i>

441
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:11,615
I think it was
those popular girls.

442
00:25:11,617 --> 00:25:15,752
You know, Supergirl,
Batgirl, Wonder Woman.

443
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:17,887
- No, there's no way.
- She's probably right.

444
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,722
I don't like 'em but I don't
think they'd do that.

445
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:20,790
<i>Think about it.</i>

446
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,158
<i>You five are
the up-and-comers.</i>

447
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,694
Who has more to lose

448
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:27,062
when you start beating them
at their best drills?

449
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:30,064
<i>We all know they're
super competitive.</i>

450
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:32,068
I even heard they cheated

451
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,670
during a group sparring match
you guys had together.

452
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:35,937
We were winning.

453
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,940
I haven't seen you
around here.

454
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:39,876
What did you say
your name was?

455
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:43,379
Divide. I was new here.

456
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,714
- Was?
- Yeah.

457
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:47,884
It's obvious that this place
is for losers.

458
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,719
Yeah, for losers.
Ha! Wait.

459
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,488
If you aren't going
to Super Hero High,

460
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,057
where are you going?

461
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,157
Haven't you heard?

462
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,561
There's a new school
in town.

463
00:25:58,563 --> 00:26:00,029
Uber High.

464
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,430
Uber High?
Never heard of it.

465
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:03,499
At Uber High,

466
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:06,235
they're all about
letting you be you.

467
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,370
Less homework,
more fun.

468
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,005
I like
the sound of that.

469
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:12,141
Yeah, but what
about our friends?

470
00:26:12,143 --> 00:26:14,776
What about them?
As far as I'm concerned,

471
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,312
you four are the only
friends I'll ever need.

472
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,014
Well, what are
you waiting for?

473
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:21,885
I think it's time you saw
you were missing.

474
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:24,353
Perfect! Let's go!

475
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:25,620
Then I laughed so hard

476
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:27,356
I spit out a hairball.

477
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:28,657
Literally.

478
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,826
Where are you guys going?

479
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:31,292
Like you care.

480
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:33,295
Yeah. We know what
you four are doing.

481
00:26:33,297 --> 00:26:35,731
And we don't have to
stay here and take it.

482
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,433
You tell 'em, Frosty!

483
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:39,735
Doing? We aren't
doing anything.

484
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,503
In fact, we were
just coming to see

485
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,974
if there was anything
we could do to help.

486
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,574
I know something you can do.

487
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:48,610
What? We're your friends.
We'll do anything.

488
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,482
Good. Stay out of our way.

489
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,557
Uber High? Hmm.

490
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,024
Something smells funny.

491
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,660
And I intend to find out
what it is.

492
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:09,532
Ah, huh?

493
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:13,205
What? It's good for you.

494
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,678
<i>There.</i>

495
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,981
<i>Uber High actually didn't
exist until yesterday.</i>

496
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:27,884
The same day everything
started getting weird.

497
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,252
It looks like
it was funded

498
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,286
through several
dummy corporations.

499
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:33,022
Can you find
the original source?

500
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:35,360
I'm Batgirl.
I can find anything.

501
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,926
<i>Bingo.</i>

502
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,195
<i>LexCorp!</i>

503
00:27:39,197 --> 00:27:40,996
Lena's behind this?

504
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,265
What does she have
against Super Hero High?

505
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:44,500
She still holds a grudge

506
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:46,435
after not being allowed
to attend here.

507
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:49,405
So, what? She's getting back
at them by stealing students?

508
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:51,573
Hmm, maybe.
But I doubt it.

509
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,176
Lena never thinks small.

510
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:54,475
The only way we're
going to find out

511
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,311
what's going on
inside that school

512
00:27:56,313 --> 00:27:58,080
is to go
to the school ourselves.

513
00:27:58,082 --> 00:28:01,884
But how? They know we'd never
leave Super Hero High.

514
00:28:01,886 --> 00:28:03,785
Hmm, we need
someone new.

515
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,021
Someone that hasn't
been here long.

516
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:07,726
Someone...

517
00:28:17,968 --> 00:28:20,668
<i>This isn't
creepy at all.</i>

518
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,205
Can you guys hear me?

519
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:23,371
<i>We hear you
loud and clear, Green Lantern.</i>

520
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:24,807
<i>With the com link in your ear</i>

521
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,574
<i>and the new Batgirl
uplink contacts,</i>

522
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:27,810
you're 555.

523
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:29,378
She's 25?

524
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,480
I didn't realize
she was that old.

525
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,515
Green Lantern,
you look great.

526
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:36,084
It's an expression.
It means she's perfect.

527
00:28:36,086 --> 00:28:38,920
Aw, that's so sweet
of you to say.

528
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,124
<i>Thanks, Batgirl.</i>

529
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:44,059
Don't be afraid.

530
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:53,301
Green Lantern, you came!

531
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:54,837
Whoa!

532
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,107
Well, well, isn't it
the newest Green Lantern.

533
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,208
What brings you
to our new school?

534
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,177
Maybe she's tired
of being, like, what,

535
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,048
the tenth Green Lantern
at Super Hero High?

536
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,682
Second. Sheesh.

537
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,551
So, what is it, GL?
Why are you here?

538
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:11,052
Uh...

539
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:12,655
Stay calm.

540
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:14,122
Just tell them you thought
that they were right,

541
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:15,558
and they weren't
getting a fair shot.

542
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,494
Um, I just think
you guys were right.

543
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:21,362
Those other girls just think
they're so cool,

544
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:22,799
always doing better
than everyone else,

545
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,334
and... Have you seen
Wonder Woman's hair?

546
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:27,538
- Dandruff!
- Totally true.

547
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,571
Hey!

548
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:31,807
I just want to be somewhere
I can figure out

549
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,443
who I'm supposed to be

550
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:36,044
without the pressure
of those other girls.

551
00:29:36,046 --> 00:29:38,549
Well, then, welcome home.

552
00:29:39,383 --> 00:29:40,449
Thanks!

553
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:42,819
Well, isn't this lovely.

554
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,187
- Who's that?
- Principal Taller.

555
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:46,955
She's the headmistress here,

556
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:48,291
and loads more fun

557
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:51,025
than that stick in the mud
at Super Hero High.

558
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:52,261
A new recruit?

559
00:29:52,263 --> 00:29:54,530
Yes. I...
I'm Green Lantern.

560
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:57,199
I just couldn't stand it
at the other school.

561
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:58,868
I hope it's okay
if I came over?

562
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,103
Of course, my dear.
The more the merrier.

563
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:04,240
Let me introduce you to our foreign
exchange student, Backlash.

564
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,478
Backlash, this is
Green Lantern.

565
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,478
She looks
really familiar.

566
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,084
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- You too.

567
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,251
Ow!

568
00:30:15,253 --> 00:30:16,785
Quite a grip
you have there.

569
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,091
<i>Oh, sorry. I learned it
in weightlifting.</i>

570
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:25,762
Lashina! That's why
she looked familiar.

571
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:27,730
Lashina, really?

572
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:31,067
Wow! She should totally wear her
hair like that all the time.

573
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,635
It looks really great.

574
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:33,735
It really does.

575
00:30:33,737 --> 00:30:35,303
Really frames her face.

576
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,106
Well, nice to meet you.

577
00:30:37,108 --> 00:30:38,774
Well, Green Lantern,

578
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,644
you've arrived just in time
for your first assignment.

579
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:44,746
Here at Uber High, we tend to
do things a bit differently.

580
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:48,217
We're more of a hands-on school,
learning through doing.

581
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:49,819
And our first exercise involves

582
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,554
helping the good people
at Project Cadmus.

583
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,490
Cadmus has asked us
to do them a favor

584
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,525
and test their security.

585
00:30:56,527 --> 00:31:00,530
<i>Our task is to infiltrate the
compound and find this object.</i>

586
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:01,897
If we're able
to obtain the object

587
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:03,866
and return to base
without being stopped,

588
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,167
you'll have passed.

589
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:06,368
<i>And you'll know
that you have the skills</i>

590
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,571
<i>to beat
the world's best security.</i>

591
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:11,206
So, who's ready
for a field trip?

592
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:15,811
Good. Your transportation is
waiting outside.

593
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:17,446
Good hunting.

594
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:20,049
Finally, a chance to show
what we can really do.

595
00:31:20,051 --> 00:31:21,817
Especially without
those good two shoes

596
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,484
next door
getting in the way.

597
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,487
All right, the bus is
waiting. Let's go!

598
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,322
I'm assuming you three will be there

599
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:28,791
to stop this, right?

600
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:30,292
<i>Don't worry,
Green Lantern,</i>

601
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:31,662
<i>you can count on us.</i>

602
00:31:33,831 --> 00:31:36,965
Fools! By the time
these girls figure out

603
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,436
I'm using them to steal
ancient alien technology,

604
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:42,670
it will be too late for them

605
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:46,675
and the world.

606
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:49,110
Principal Taller is
totally using our friends

607
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:51,045
to try and steal
that vase!

608
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,548
Yes, but why?

609
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,753
Maybe for an evil bouquet
of flowers?

610
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,587
We need to confront them.

611
00:31:57,589 --> 00:31:59,353
They're our friends,
they'll listen.

612
00:31:59,355 --> 00:32:00,889
And tell them what?

613
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:03,326
That their new school isn't
for super heroes,

614
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,263
it's for supervillains.

615
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:09,698
Magic is about give and take.

616
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,334
It's about seeing
that which is invisible

617
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,769
with the visible.

618
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:16,571
It's also about staying awake
in class.

619
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:19,274
I'll fight you!

620
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:22,011
<i>Remember
to read chapter 33</i>

621
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:23,446
<i>on the benefits
of toadstools</i>

622
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,749
in potions
and salads. Dismissed.

623
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,717
<i>Except for you two.</i>

624
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,222
You both slept
in class today and...

625
00:32:32,223 --> 00:32:33,889
We slept through
our midterm?

626
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,124
No! That means...

627
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:36,458
We're failing!

628
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,927
I've never failed
at anything in my life.

629
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:39,994
Professor Fate!

630
00:32:39,996 --> 00:32:41,530
Professor? Pssht.

631
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,398
I didn't go through
four years of magic school

632
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
to be called a professor.

633
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:47,770
Not to mention the debt
I'm carrying. Oi!

634
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:49,272
Please.

635
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,173
Call me Doctor.

636
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,642
Doctor Fate, there has to be
something we can do to make this up.

637
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:56,811
As much as I hate
to agree with Bumblebee,

638
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,417
she's right.
We'll do anything!

639
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,285
Hmm.

640
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:05,087
I see your problem
is not sleep

641
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:06,621
but something else.

642
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:10,024
Yes. I will help you
help yourself.

643
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:11,260
Follow me.

644
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,427
Did you understand
any of that?

645
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:13,797
Not a word.

646
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:20,168
Behold, your extra credit.

647
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,603
A globe?

648
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,338
Not just a globe,

649
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,007
but the Globe of Fate.

650
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:31,580
What does the Globe
of Fate do?

651
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,851
Place your hands
on the globe.

652
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,457
It looks like...

653
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,693
A necklace!

654
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:46,428
Yes, the necklace of Wotan.

655
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,630
It has been lost for centuries.

656
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:51,967
I sense this item will not only
help you pass your class,

657
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:56,304
but it will also help the school
in its time of greatest need.

658
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:57,506
Dramatic much?

659
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:59,308
So, how are we
supposed to find it?

660
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,646
The globe will show you.

661
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,349
No problem.

662
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:09,150
I'll be there
and back in no time.

663
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,553
You'll be there?

664
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:11,754
I'll be there first
and bring it back

665
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:13,622
before you even
get close.

666
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,427
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

667
00:34:16,593 --> 00:34:19,997
I may
have to rethink tenure.

668
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:32,941
Yes, yes, very good.

669
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:35,244
Assemble a team
and bring it back to me.

670
00:34:35,246 --> 00:34:37,546
It must be powerful
if Fate wants it,

671
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,580
which means
I need it first.

672
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,517
Oh, nothing.
We're on a field trip.

673
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,120
Yeah. I mean,
it's going okay.

674
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,455
I appreciate you asking.

675
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:51,861
Salmon, maybe
with some asparagus.

676
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:54,528
Well, you don't get
where I am by eating poorly.

677
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,631
Too funny.

678
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:57,999
We're here!

679
00:35:08,111 --> 00:35:09,276
All right, ladies!

680
00:35:09,278 --> 00:35:10,579
The clock is ticking.

681
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:12,015
Show us what you've got.

682
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:14,552
Ivy.

683
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,130
I'll check the perimeter.

684
00:35:31,302 --> 00:35:33,369
- Uh, hey, Jack.
- Hey, Al. How's it going?

685
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,305
Uh, my daughter's got
this song stuck in my head.

686
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:37,939
Oh, yeah, which one?

687
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,475
Ugh, you know.

688
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:42,512
<i>♪ Get your cape on
And let's take flight</i>

689
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:43,646
<i>♪ You can do... ♪</i>

690
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:45,682
Oh, yeah.
I hate that song!

691
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:56,624
Perimeter clear of weeds.

692
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,095
Good. Come on.

693
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:04,633
So, can you do it?

694
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:07,439
Please! I'm Catwoman.

695
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,876
After you.

696
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:16,647
Where are you guys?

697
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:23,385
Whoa! This place is bigger

698
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,521
than Giganta's closet.

699
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:27,789
How are we going
to find this thing?

700
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:31,059
Split up. Harley, Frost,
you take that row.

701
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:33,262
Ivy, Catwoman,
take that one.

702
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:36,798
Green Lantern, Backlash
and I will take the last one.

703
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,035
And ladies, they never said
we have to be gentle.

704
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,905
Ooh! I was hoping
you'd say that.

705
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:50,778
Nope. Not here.

706
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:52,981
<i>Here neither!</i>

707
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,219
This is going
to take forever.

708
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:02,691
Ooh, look who decided
to crash the party.

709
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:04,425
This isn't
a party, Harley.

710
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:07,662
You are being used by your
new school to commit crimes!

711
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:10,432
Sounds like Supergirl's
a little bit jealous

712
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:12,667
that Cadmus asked us
to help them

713
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,135
and not her.

714
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:15,704
I think
you're right, Harley.

715
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:18,305
And what do we do
to the jealous types?

716
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:19,374
Smash 'em!

717
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:20,809
Harley, I'm bulletproof.

718
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:23,178
What's a mallet
going to do?

719
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,582
Distract you.

720
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,483
Oh, would you
look at that?

721
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:32,656
Beating on Supergirl's totally
gonna save us a ton of time!

722
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:37,091
This is kitty-tastic.

723
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:40,195
When was the last time Super Hero
High let us out of our cage?

724
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:43,398
You're going to spend
a lot of time in a cage

725
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,233
if you don't stop
what you're doing.

726
00:37:45,235 --> 00:37:47,702
Well, isn't it
the Doll Knight

727
00:37:47,704 --> 00:37:49,204
come to ruin our fun.

728
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,640
Don't you have classes
you're supposed to be in?

729
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:54,142
Principal Waller frowns
on truancy.

730
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,812
And the police frown
on breaking and entering

731
00:37:56,814 --> 00:37:58,914
which you're doing right now.

732
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,350
I know
breaking and entering.

733
00:38:01,352 --> 00:38:02,617
And for that
to happen

734
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,119
we'd have to
not be invited.

735
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:06,687
But we are,
and you're in our way.

736
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,256
No! You're being used!

737
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:10,526
It's actually Lena
who's behind this!

738
00:38:10,528 --> 00:38:11,829
Out of the way, Batgirl.

739
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:25,876
Nope!

740
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:29,111
Anything yet?

741
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:30,479
<i>The only thing
you're going to find</i>

742
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,646
in those boxes is
trouble, Cheetah.

743
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:32,881
<i>Wonder woman!</i>

744
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:34,283
Come to try
and bring us back

745
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:36,285
so you have someone
to play second fiddle?

746
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:38,419
Second fiddle is actually an
important part of an orchestra.

747
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:40,988
But, no! That's not
what I'm doing.

748
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,591
Lena Luthor is using you,

749
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:44,559
all of you,
to steal for her!

750
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:45,626
Do you have any proof?

751
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:47,162
Some bank receipts and...

752
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:49,834
Enough talk! This is
obviously part of the test.

753
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:55,204
I've got her!

754
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:57,175
Green Lantern,
do something.

755
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:03,246
Ooh! Sorry.

756
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,193
Here, let me help.

757
00:39:17,628 --> 00:39:19,495
Green Lantern, no!

758
00:39:19,497 --> 00:39:20,898
This isn't helping.

759
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,005
Now, give up quietly or...

760
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,111
There!

761
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,613
I loves me some capes!

762
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:40,184
Catwoman, heads up!

763
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,954
And that's a wrap, team.
Back to the bus!

764
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,823
Cheetah, don't!

765
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,392
Sorry, Blunder Woman.

766
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:52,026
That's called strategy.

767
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:54,698
Maybe I can loan you
a book on it sometime.

768
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,905
Wonderful.

769
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,041
You girls are
all getting an A.

770
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:09,410
- Yeah!
- Haha, yeah!

771
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:10,479
We work as a team!

772
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:15,316
Yay!

773
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:17,753
That didn't go at all
like we planned.

774
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:19,021
You have
to admit though,

775
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:20,689
this school must be
doing something right

776
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:24,727
because they've gotten
way better!

777
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:29,033
What? Is this one of those saying-something
non-appropriate times? Sorry.

778
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:38,073
Looks like Katana comes
in second place.

779
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:39,077
Again.

780
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:41,410
What?

781
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,818
Last one to the entrance
is a drone, Bumblebee!

782
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,325
Looks like it's hot.

783
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:59,760
Yes. Our last one,
I wager.

784
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:01,098
You better
believe it.

785
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:09,306
Step back. Let a real
woman take a shot.

786
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,211
So, when will
this real woman appear?

787
00:41:16,213 --> 00:41:17,412
Har har.

788
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,080
Maybe we need
a special word.

789
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:21,783
Some sort of key
to unlock the door.

790
00:41:21,785 --> 00:41:23,053
Wait, there!

791
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,287
What does it say?

792
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,323
I only got a C
in Ancient Hieroglyphics.

793
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:30,658
A C?
I got a C+.

794
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,593
It appears to say

795
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:35,097
<i>"Watch out below."</i>

796
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,869
Watch out below?
That's weird.

797
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:47,709
That was close.

798
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:50,345
Yes.
Thank you for saving me.

799
00:41:50,347 --> 00:41:51,546
Of course!

800
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,814
One to zero,
my lead.

801
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:04,228
Look out!

802
00:42:05,928 --> 00:42:08,597
- Thanks.
- One-one, tied.

803
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:13,769
<i>Obviously,
things didn't go so well.</i>

804
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:15,169
<i>But we have a plan.</i>

805
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:16,905
<i>If you can get
the girls alone</i>

806
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:19,374
<i>and one by one tell them
about Lena owning the school,</i>

807
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:20,876
<i>maybe they'll listen to reason.</i>

808
00:42:20,878 --> 00:42:22,443
Uh... Sure.

809
00:42:22,445 --> 00:42:25,479
But maybe now isn't
the best time for that.

810
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:30,818
We just beat Supergirl!

811
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,655
We just beat Wonder Woman.

812
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:35,860
We just beat Batgirl! Whoa!

813
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:38,626
Very impressive.

814
00:42:38,628 --> 00:42:40,995
It seems that your short
time here has improved

815
00:42:40,997 --> 00:42:42,631
your skills dramatically.

816
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:45,666
But here at Uber High,
we don't rest on our laurels.

817
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:47,971
No. There is
still more to do.

818
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:50,271
Is that...

819
00:42:50,273 --> 00:42:52,039
...the Rock
of Eternity?

820
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,541
The Rock of Eternity?

821
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:54,977
The Rock of Eternity.

822
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:56,845
And placed deep
in the bowels...

823
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:59,715
Bowels?

824
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:04,086
Come on. Bowels?
Seriously? It's funny!

825
00:43:06,956 --> 00:43:08,590
Bowels!

826
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:14,963
As I was saying,

827
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:16,363
deep in the bowels...

828
00:43:17,434 --> 00:43:19,667
In the lair
of the ancient wizards

829
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:21,336
sit seven statues.

830
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:23,771
<i>Each statue guards
a magical stone</i>

831
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:27,276
<i>which could be dangerous
in the wrong hands.</i>

832
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:28,744
<i>Yes, Green Lantern?</i>

833
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:31,312
Um, are you telling me
we're going to break into

834
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:34,283
an old, powerful wizard's
living room

835
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:35,483
for what?

836
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:37,686
Does he want us
to test his security too?

837
00:43:37,688 --> 00:43:39,254
Good question.

838
00:43:39,256 --> 00:43:41,323
The reality is that we have
good intel that suggests

839
00:43:41,325 --> 00:43:44,925
the wizard has in fact
turned evil.

840
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:50,064
Oh, come on!
That can't be true.

841
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,367
With these jewels,

842
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,602
he will be able to leave
the Rock of Eternity

843
00:43:53,604 --> 00:43:55,202
and take over the world.

844
00:43:55,204 --> 00:43:57,472
<i>But only if you girls let him.</i>

845
00:43:57,474 --> 00:44:00,376
But, you know, if you think
you need a few more classes

846
00:44:00,378 --> 00:44:01,542
on being a hero,

847
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:03,778
rather than just going out
and being one,

848
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,383
I know a school across town
that can help.

849
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:09,816
You can count on us,
Principal taller.

850
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:11,019
Can't she, ladies?

851
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,291
Good. I knew I could.

852
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:19,963
All right, Uber High.
Get going!

853
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:24,999
Cheetah, can I talk
to you for a minute?

854
00:44:25,001 --> 00:44:26,202
Sure.

855
00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:30,437
How about in here?

856
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:33,742
<i>Wanted... Wanted... To talk.</i>

857
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:36,278
There's too much interference
in the computer room.

858
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,082
I can't maintain
our connection.

859
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:40,550
We've lost her.

860
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:42,917
Listen, Cheetah,

861
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,553
I've been in contact
with Wonder Woman,

862
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:46,789
Supergirl and Batgirl
this whole time.

863
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:48,055
They were right!

864
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:49,823
This school is
bought and paid for

865
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:51,225
by Lena Luthor.

866
00:44:51,227 --> 00:44:52,528
We think she's
using everyone

867
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,963
to get this artifact
in order to...

868
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:56,798
Well, we don't
know why yet.

869
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,033
But generally,
you collect ancient artifacts

870
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:00,769
to rule the world.

871
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:02,073
So, my money is on that.

872
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,041
So, she was right.

873
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:09,044
- Who was right?
- <i>Jessica Cruz.</i>

874
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:12,049
A Green Lantern
through and through.

875
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:15,216
You knew? No!

876
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:16,550
You're being
brainwashed.

877
00:45:16,552 --> 00:45:17,653
You must be.

878
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:19,220
There's no way
you'd do this.

879
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:20,622
Cheetah has
come to realize

880
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,593
that heroism is just
another word for sucker.

881
00:45:24,928 --> 00:45:27,095
Lena! I knew it!

882
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,662
Well, actually Batgirl knew it.

883
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,497
But she's super smart,
so I totally believed her.

884
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:33,669
Yes. Too clever
for your own good.

885
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:34,669
That's right.

886
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:36,370
In fact, my friends
are seeing

887
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:38,606
everything that's happening
as we speak.

888
00:45:38,608 --> 00:45:40,108
They'll go
to the authorities

889
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,010
and soon, you'll be
behind bars.

890
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:45,146
Oh, my dear.

891
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:46,513
I deduced
you were working

892
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:49,651
for those super happy
fun girls this whole time.

893
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:51,352
In fact, I imagine
that you're wearing

894
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,954
some sort of com device
on your purse

895
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,423
in this very minute.

896
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:55,657
An earpiece?

897
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:58,660
Maybe a state of the art
contact camera?

898
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:02,463
Why do you think Cheetah
led you into this room?

899
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,231
There is
an electromagnetic field

900
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:08,102
that won't allow
any signals in or out.

901
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:10,771
I'm afraid
you're on your own.

902
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:13,140
Me? Against you two?

903
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:14,843
You need better odds.

904
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:16,845
We do. Boys.

905
00:46:17,947 --> 00:46:19,446
My yellow Kryptomites tend

906
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:22,550
to bring out
a lot of fear in people.

907
00:46:22,552 --> 00:46:24,285
I imagine
a little fear isn't

908
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,553
a problem for someone
such as yourself.

909
00:46:26,555 --> 00:46:28,793
Is it, Green Lantern?

910
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:31,795
I can't see anything.

911
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,428
I think... Yes!

912
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,133
<i>There's a light
at the end of the tunnel!</i>

913
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:42,106
Wow!

914
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,144
There it is!

915
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,146
<i>The necklace of Wotan!</i>

916
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:53,717
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm getting it!

917
00:46:58,354 --> 00:47:00,224
Not a chance, Katana.

918
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:17,738
Let me guess,
you followed us here.

919
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:21,475
To get the necklace?

920
00:47:21,477 --> 00:47:23,378
We're gonna have to
fight, aren't we?

921
00:47:25,182 --> 00:47:28,319
- I bet I can beat more than you.
- You're on!

922
00:47:34,023 --> 00:47:35,591
Everyone is staring.

923
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:37,758
Are you sure we're
in the right place?

924
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,729
Yep. According to my intel
this is the stop.

925
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:42,963
We just have to wait
here for the S train.

926
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:44,701
Speaking of which...

927
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:56,644
All aboard!

928
00:47:56,646 --> 00:47:58,680
How long do you think
it takes to get to this rock?

929
00:47:58,682 --> 00:47:59,847
In this thing,

930
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:01,418
probably an eternity.

931
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,789
I didn't realize

932
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:09,490
it was a bullet train.

933
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:11,392
And they say
mass transit is slow.

934
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:13,294
<i>Batgirl, can you hear me?</i>

935
00:48:13,296 --> 00:48:14,762
Green Lantern,
is that you?

936
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:16,731
We lost you for a while.
Are you okay?

937
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:19,200
<i>Sorry, I think something...
The connection.</i>

938
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:20,635
<i>It should be
better now.</i>

939
00:48:20,637 --> 00:48:22,303
Uh, I'm still not
getting a camera feed.

940
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:24,338
- Where are you?
- <i>At the Rock of Eternity.</i>

941
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,039
<i>I've convinced
several of the girls</i>

942
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,475
<i>Lena is behind it all.</i>

943
00:48:27,477 --> 00:48:29,211
<i>If you hurry, we can
take her down together.</i>

944
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:50,463
All right!

945
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:52,332
Super beat-down time!

946
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,304
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

947
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:04,211
We're here.
Where are you?

948
00:49:04,213 --> 00:49:06,213
<i>Above you.</i>

949
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,316
So good of you
to join us.

950
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,053
Lena! What have you done
with Green Lantern?

951
00:49:11,055 --> 00:49:14,858
You'll find out
soon enough. Backlash!

952
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:24,601
Huh? Cheetah?

953
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:28,436
The door!

954
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:30,704
We really have to start
being more careful.

955
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,039
You can
say that again.

956
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:35,075
We really have to start
being more careful.

957
00:49:35,077 --> 00:49:37,778
It's just a figure
of speech, Supergirl.

958
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,180
Oh.

959
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:42,149
Wait, if Lena was
impersonating Green Lantern,

960
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,887
then where is
Green Lantern?

961
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:46,756
Right here.

962
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,559
Green Lantern!

963
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,327
Are you all right?

964
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,062
I think so.

965
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:55,830
Cheetah was helping Lena.

966
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:58,166
She used
these Kryptomites.

967
00:49:58,168 --> 00:50:01,403
They were coming after me
when I must have passed out.

968
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:02,736
Brainwashed.

969
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:05,173
Uh, I don't know.
She seemed like Cheetah.

970
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:07,608
Well, except for the whole
leading-us-into-a-trap.

971
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,077
I'm sure she doesn't know
what she's doing.

972
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,812
She's not always nice

973
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:13,682
but she'd never turn evil.

974
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:16,084
We'll never know unless
we can get out of here.

975
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:17,519
You're right, Jess.

976
00:50:17,521 --> 00:50:18,753
It'll take more than
a couple of bricks

977
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:20,820
to keep us
contained. Supergirl.

978
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:23,524
One hole in the wall
coming up!

979
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:27,327
What just happened?

980
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,164
The only thing that could
stop a punch from Supergirl.

981
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,332
Magic.

982
00:50:31,334 --> 00:50:32,733
Which would make sense.

983
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:35,437
This whole place is
kind of magic central.

984
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:36,738
Couldn't figure
that one out

985
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,439
before I punched
the wall?

986
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,408
Sorry.

987
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,479
So, what do we do now?

988
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:02,930
Where are they?

989
00:51:02,932 --> 00:51:04,899
- We're here.
- Where did you guys go?

990
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:08,269
Just taking care
of a little unfinished business.

991
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:10,671
Unfinished business? Here?

992
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:12,974
It doesn't matter.
What does matter is

993
00:51:12,976 --> 00:51:16,309
that the jewels that we are
looking for are right there.

994
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:17,678
We just need
to retrieve the gems

995
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,546
without that old geezer
seeing us

996
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:20,948
<i>and we'll have succeeded.</i>

997
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,619
...the dragon.

998
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,055
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

999
00:51:27,057 --> 00:51:29,590
That can't have
good lumbar support.

1000
00:51:29,592 --> 00:51:31,725
If this guy is supposed
to be so smart,

1001
00:51:31,727 --> 00:51:34,396
why is there a giant brick
hanging over his head?

1002
00:51:34,398 --> 00:51:35,896
<i>I think it's symbolic.</i>

1003
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:37,832
Really? Looks
like granite to me.

1004
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:40,104
Shh. We don't
want him to hear us.

1005
00:51:41,204 --> 00:51:43,470
Oh, nature calls.

1006
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:46,677
Shouldn't have had that
second glass before bed.

1007
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,113
Hurry, before he returns.

1008
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:01,455
<i>Oh!</i>

1009
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:03,390
<i>Pardon me.</i>

1010
00:52:03,392 --> 00:52:05,760
Ooh, unless that was
the sound of thunder

1011
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:08,131
I think he's gonna
be there a while.

1012
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:14,269
Ooh, he's actually
kind of cute!

1013
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,472
Come on, Harley.

1014
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:23,577
There. That wasn't
so hard.

1015
00:52:33,256 --> 00:52:34,758
Run! Faster!

1016
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:46,267
We got
what we came for.

1017
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:47,568
Now, let's leave.

1018
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,769
Come on, Backlash!

1019
00:52:48,771 --> 00:52:50,474
Let's blow
this pop stand.

1020
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:08,959
Fourteen.

1021
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:12,596
Fourteen, 15 and 16.

1022
00:53:15,597 --> 00:53:17,164
Wait! Katana, look!

1023
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,001
I'm not so foolish...

1024
00:53:20,003 --> 00:53:22,573
You just lay down.
I'll get 'em!

1025
00:53:31,548 --> 00:53:33,381
Your blasts
are ineffective.

1026
00:53:33,383 --> 00:53:34,585
I got him.

1027
00:53:37,686 --> 00:53:39,088
No. I have him.

1028
00:53:49,331 --> 00:53:51,332
This is your fault!

1029
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:53,100
You know, I'm sorry.

1030
00:53:53,102 --> 00:53:54,769
If I hadn't
been so competitive,

1031
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:56,704
I would've noticed
they stole the necklace.

1032
00:53:56,706 --> 00:53:58,740
No, it's my fault.

1033
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:01,809
Honestly, I'm just trying
to keep up with you.

1034
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:03,510
You make me
a better hero.

1035
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:04,947
I think the same of you!

1036
00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:14,454
What do we do now?

1037
00:54:14,456 --> 00:54:16,526
I have an idea. Trust me?

1038
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:42,786
We're too late.

1039
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:45,084
We must return
to Doctor Fate

1040
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:47,454
and tell him we failed
our magic class

1041
00:54:47,456 --> 00:54:48,758
and the school.

1042
00:54:49,526 --> 00:54:50,959
- Anything?
- Maybe.

1043
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:53,561
Magical construction is
really quite fascinating.

1044
00:54:53,563 --> 00:54:57,365
Every brick seems to fit exactly
in line with everything else.

1045
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:59,300
There's almost no space
in between.

1046
00:54:59,302 --> 00:55:00,367
So what do we do?

1047
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,436
We make some space.

1048
00:55:02,438 --> 00:55:03,838
Wait, I thought
you just said...

1049
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,340
You know the rule.

1050
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:07,774
Don't interrupt Batgirl
when she's genius-ing.

1051
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,309
When Cheetah closed the door,

1052
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,812
she must have activated
some sort of magical lock.

1053
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:14,148
If we can get the door open
even a little bit,

1054
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,684
I bet I can jar the lock
and set us free.

1055
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:18,751
Supergirl, if you use
your freeze breath

1056
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:20,088
to contract the brick

1057
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,856
while Green Lantern creates
a crowbar

1058
00:55:21,858 --> 00:55:23,791
that Wonder Woman will pull
with her super strength,

1059
00:55:23,793 --> 00:55:25,758
it might give us
the space we need.

1060
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,296
So, what do you think?

1061
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:32,803
Girls!

1062
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:36,905
Okay then. Let's do it.

1063
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:40,173
Uh... What are
we doing, exactly?

1064
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:53,657
Green Lantern.

1065
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:56,860
Your turn, Wonder Woman.

1066
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:04,265
It's working. Keep going.

1067
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:07,070
I can't
hold it much longer.

1068
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:08,803
One more second.

1069
00:56:08,805 --> 00:56:10,007
It's slipping!

1070
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:16,845
- Did it work?
- Listen.

1071
00:56:23,887 --> 00:56:24,952
You did it!

1072
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:26,854
Genius-ing wins again.

1073
00:56:26,856 --> 00:56:28,222
Can we go home now?

1074
00:56:28,224 --> 00:56:30,427
Once we find Cheetah
and the others. Come on!

1075
00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:36,530
They're gone!

1076
00:56:36,532 --> 00:56:39,501
Hey, Batgirl. Didn't your research
about the rock of eternity

1077
00:56:39,503 --> 00:56:42,070
say something about
seven statue thingies?

1078
00:56:42,072 --> 00:56:44,070
They're supposed
to be right here.

1079
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:45,472
But I don't see them.

1080
00:56:45,474 --> 00:56:46,909
Wait, there's one.

1081
00:56:55,985 --> 00:56:57,387
But where are the rest?

1082
00:57:08,331 --> 00:57:10,296
I've got Pride!

1083
00:57:10,298 --> 00:57:13,667
Aw, I wanted Pride.

1084
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:17,137
All I have is
stupid old Envy.

1085
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:19,475
I'll take Envy. I can
add it to my collection.

1086
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:22,477
The sins are influencing us.

1087
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:24,881
The longer we stay here
the worse it's going to get.

1088
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:33,724
Formation mud drop.

1089
00:57:42,298 --> 00:57:43,300
Go, go!

1090
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:49,570
They're coming!

1091
00:57:49,572 --> 00:57:51,771
- What's wrong?
- I'm out of change!

1092
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:53,374
Who uses
cash anymore?

1093
00:57:53,376 --> 00:57:55,075
Didn't they give you
a transfer?

1094
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,276
I didn't ask for one.

1095
00:57:56,278 --> 00:57:59,247
You always ask
for a transfer!

1096
00:57:59,249 --> 00:58:00,881
We'll have to
stand and fight.

1097
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:03,149
Wait! I can get us
out of here.

1098
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:04,153
I think.

1099
00:58:10,293 --> 00:58:12,026
This is gonna be
the best thing

1100
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:14,464
to come out of this
garage in a long time.

1101
00:58:17,265 --> 00:58:18,267
Huh?

1102
00:58:35,952 --> 00:58:40,019
I stand corrected.

1103
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:43,657
If you've got something
up your sleeve, Supergirl,

1104
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,892
now's the time.

1105
00:58:44,894 --> 00:58:46,227
Supergirl?

1106
00:58:46,229 --> 00:58:48,930
There. All right.
We should be...

1107
00:58:48,932 --> 00:58:50,133
Good.

1108
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:54,801
Tada!

1109
00:58:54,803 --> 00:58:57,872
One genetically controlled,
dimensional traveling rocketship

1110
00:58:57,874 --> 00:59:00,506
from Krypton at your service.

1111
00:59:00,508 --> 00:59:01,577
What about the sins?

1112
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:12,921
Here we go.

1113
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:15,992
Should have made
these steps smaller.

1114
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:20,063
Hmm.

1115
00:59:20,463 --> 00:59:21,898
Nah.

1116
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:24,234
Hmm?

1117
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:38,312
Yeah!

1118
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:40,782
Oh, come on, guys. Work it!

1119
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,716
I don't know.
I mean,

1120
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:44,350
I guess
I'm having fun.

1121
00:59:44,352 --> 00:59:48,021
Yeah. Honestly, I kinda miss our
friends at Super Hero High.

1122
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:50,957
I agree. Where's
the challenge?

1123
00:59:50,959 --> 00:59:52,225
Are you all crazy?

1124
00:59:52,227 --> 00:59:54,595
We finally get to go out
and so something.

1125
00:59:54,597 --> 00:59:56,930
What? You'd rather
be stuck in a classroom

1126
00:59:56,932 --> 00:59:59,066
while Beast Boy asks
stupid questions?

1127
00:59:59,068 --> 01:00:00,501
- Well...
- Maybe.

1128
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,669
I mean, he is funny.

1129
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:04,570
Ugh, you guys disgust me.

1130
01:00:04,572 --> 01:00:08,410
All right, ladies. It's time
for today's final lesson.

1131
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:13,513
This ancient device was
stolen eons ago,

1132
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:14,914
and can now be located

1133
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:17,785
in the classroom
of one Doctor Fate.

1134
01:00:17,787 --> 01:00:21,088
Wait. You want us to break
into Super Hero High

1135
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,789
and steal something?

1136
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:25,258
I don't know how comfortable
I am with that.

1137
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,130
This doesn't seem like a
lesson, Principal Taller.

1138
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:30,396
I'm sorry, Frost.

1139
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:33,166
When did you get
your teaching credential?

1140
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:34,301
- No, I...
- This will teach you

1141
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,035
how to finish an objective,

1142
01:00:36,037 --> 01:00:37,537
and prove once and for all

1143
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:40,039
that you are better
than your former classmates.

1144
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:42,876
Well, can't we do that without
having to break into the school?

1145
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:45,345
- Yes, we can.
- Cheetah.

1146
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:48,381
Coach Wildcat is always up
for some friendly competition.

1147
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:51,486
And I know you guys want
to see our friends again.

1148
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:53,586
Well, what if we challenge
Super Hero High

1149
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:55,122
to a sparring match?

1150
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:56,823
With everything we've learned,

1151
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:59,191
I bet we take down our former
classmates in no time.

1152
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:00,660
Good thinking, sugar!

1153
01:01:00,662 --> 01:01:03,830
Yes, I like that idea.

1154
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:05,332
What are you doing?

1155
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,834
While everyone's attention is
on the match,

1156
01:01:06,836 --> 01:01:09,535
no one will be watching
Doctor Fate's classroom.

1157
01:01:09,537 --> 01:01:11,204
Giving someone
the opportunity

1158
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:12,807
to nab the globe.

1159
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:16,242
You really are valedictorian
material, Cheetah.

1160
01:01:16,244 --> 01:01:18,080
Thank you,
Principal Taller.

1161
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:28,821
Hey! Coach Wildcat is
looking for you four.

1162
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,124
Coach Wildcat?

1163
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:31,658
We don't have time
for his shenanigans.

1164
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:33,126
No. That's perfect.

1165
01:01:33,128 --> 01:01:34,928
It's time to rope in
the teachers.

1166
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:36,062
We'll tell him what's going on

1167
01:01:36,064 --> 01:01:37,564
and he'll get Waller and Grodd.

1168
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:40,367
Then we can go to Uber High
and get our friends.

1169
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,037
Great idea.
Come on!

1170
01:01:44,106 --> 01:01:45,573
Oh, thank you, Cyborg!

1171
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:47,475
That was nice of you
to relay the message.

1172
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:50,113
You're welcome, girls.
All in a day's work.

1173
01:01:53,316 --> 01:01:55,182
- Coach Wildcat!
- Lena Luthor brainwashed...

1174
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,383
I'm starving!

1175
01:01:56,385 --> 01:01:58,251
Girls, where have you been?

1176
01:01:58,253 --> 01:01:59,754
- Locked in a trap!
- Brainwashed!

1177
01:01:59,756 --> 01:02:02,021
- Fighting monsters!
- I'm still hungry!

1178
01:02:02,023 --> 01:02:04,925
There'll be plenty of time to say
whatever it is you want to say later.

1179
01:02:04,927 --> 01:02:08,162
Right now, Principal Waller has
agreed to group sparring match

1180
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:10,100
with the girls from Uber High.

1181
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:13,334
You don't understand. We...

1182
01:02:13,336 --> 01:02:15,205
Three, two, one, go!

1183
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:18,972
Catwoman, listen!

1184
01:02:18,974 --> 01:02:20,073
We don't have to fight.

1185
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:21,642
Uber High is actually a front

1186
01:02:21,644 --> 01:02:23,811
for Lena Luthor's
nefarious plans.

1187
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:26,079
That's just a pile
of kitty litter.

1188
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:29,018
You're just jealous we're finally
getting the respect we deserve!

1189
01:02:53,075 --> 01:02:54,809
Come on, Wondy,

1190
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:55,812
Stand still!

1191
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:05,251
Listen, Harley, Lena
Luthor is using you guys

1192
01:03:05,253 --> 01:03:06,954
to steal a bunch
of things for...

1193
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:08,622
Well, we don't know
that part yet.

1194
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:10,691
But we don't want to see
you guys get into trouble.

1195
01:03:10,693 --> 01:03:12,059
You have to believe us!

1196
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:13,760
Oh, I believe you.

1197
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:15,329
You do?

1198
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:17,030
Oh, I've known pretty
much from the start

1199
01:03:17,032 --> 01:03:18,399
something was
going on.

1200
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:20,468
But it sounded
like a fun time!

1201
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:29,910
Catwoman, you and the other girls
are so good at what you do

1202
01:03:29,912 --> 01:03:32,379
that we have to work really
hard just to keep up.

1203
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:34,314
You girls make us
better heroes.

1204
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,983
We don't just respect you,

1205
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:37,454
we need you.

1206
01:03:38,354 --> 01:03:40,419
- Really?
- Really.

1207
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:43,524
You know, you aren't
so bad... For a bat.

1208
01:03:43,526 --> 01:03:46,262
And you're not
so terrible for a cat.

1209
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:50,800
Leave me alone!

1210
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:58,705
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tree, really.
- No!

1211
01:03:58,707 --> 01:03:59,740
Are you okay?

1212
01:03:59,742 --> 01:04:01,941
This is what happens
when friends fight.

1213
01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:03,343
Other people get hurt.

1214
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:05,479
You're right.
I never wanted to.

1215
01:04:05,481 --> 01:04:06,747
But there was
this girl,

1216
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,981
and she said
you guys hated us.

1217
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:11,619
Hated you? I can
never hate you!

1218
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:13,120
We love you guys,

1219
01:04:13,122 --> 01:04:16,157
which is why we've been chasing
you down all over the globe.

1220
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:17,356
We miss you,

1221
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,191
and we wanna
make sure you're okay.

1222
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:22,930
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I know, I'm sorry!

1223
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:33,707
So, decided to go back
over to Super Hero High?

1224
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:37,278
If by "decided", you mean Cheetah
and Lena Luthor knocked me out

1225
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,180
and left us for dead
in the Rock of Eternity,

1226
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:41,384
then yeah!

1227
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:45,017
What? You're lying!

1228
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:48,622
If I'm lying, where's Cheetah
and Principal Taller?

1229
01:04:48,624 --> 01:04:51,160
You know, you might be right.

1230
01:04:54,063 --> 01:04:55,465
Let's do this together.

1231
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,566
What in tarnation
are you doing?

1232
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,102
The match isn't over!

1233
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:04,604
There hasn't even been
one good knockout yet!

1234
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,807
Coach, I think
we've made a mistake.

1235
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:10,376
Yeah. We don't wanna
fight our friends anymore.

1236
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:12,379
Plus, we think
that Principal Taller is

1237
01:05:12,381 --> 01:05:14,247
actually Lena Luthor
in disguise.

1238
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:16,885
She's here to steal something
from Doctor Fate's classroom.

1239
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:26,492
Well, it looks like we might
get that knockout after all.

1240
01:05:26,494 --> 01:05:28,896
What are you waiting for?
Go save the day!

1241
01:05:28,898 --> 01:05:31,198
Yeah, let's go!

1242
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,402
Yeah!

1243
01:05:35,738 --> 01:05:37,473
<i>The Globe of Fate!</i>

1244
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:39,776
Stop right there!

1245
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:44,678
Principal Waller? I...

1246
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,682
What? Why are you and
Cheetah in the magic class?

1247
01:05:47,684 --> 01:05:50,916
Not that I need
to answer to you, Batgirl,

1248
01:05:50,918 --> 01:05:53,454
but I was showing
these girls our facilities,

1249
01:05:53,456 --> 01:05:55,455
trying to persuade them
to re-enroll.

1250
01:05:55,457 --> 01:05:57,457
Oh, that makes sense.

1251
01:05:57,459 --> 01:05:59,091
Now if you'll excuse me,

1252
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:00,827
I'd like
to continue my tour.

1253
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:01,930
I don't buy it!

1254
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:06,535
And people say
I'm the crazy one!

1255
01:06:10,072 --> 01:06:11,805
<i>Lena Luthor!</i>

1256
01:06:11,807 --> 01:06:13,039
They were right!

1257
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,709
Of course, they were.

1258
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:17,044
Annoyingly, they always are.

1259
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:18,445
But it's too late.

1260
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:21,950
And I'm Lashina!

1261
01:06:22,985 --> 01:06:24,350
Yeah, we kinda figured.

1262
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:25,519
- But the wig!
- Meh.

1263
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:27,687
Enough! Boys!

1264
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:30,256
Keep them back
while I finish this.

1265
01:06:30,258 --> 01:06:35,028
At last. The final piece
of my master plan.

1266
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,497
What? To start
a jewelry store?

1267
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:39,602
Nothing so mundane.

1268
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:51,044
I know she's evil
and all...

1269
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:53,412
But that is awesome!

1270
01:06:53,414 --> 01:06:55,416
It is awesome.

1271
01:06:55,418 --> 01:06:57,218
But not awesome enough.

1272
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,718
You girls unwittingly helped me

1273
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,220
steal a series
of ancient power supplies

1274
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:04,992
that will make me unstoppable.

1275
01:07:04,994 --> 01:07:06,693
So, what was the vase for?

1276
01:07:06,695 --> 01:07:09,428
An evil bouquet of flowers, duh!

1277
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:12,099
Now...

1278
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:16,706
Feel the power
of my super mecha-suit!

1279
01:07:19,775 --> 01:07:22,075
I'd like to thank you

1280
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:24,477
for securing your own demise.

1281
01:07:24,479 --> 01:07:26,613
Demise? Wait!

1282
01:07:26,615 --> 01:07:28,249
You didn't say
anything about that!

1283
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:29,852
Oh. Didn't I?

1284
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:37,124
Cheetah, are you okay?

1285
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,557
Is she still
brainwashing you?

1286
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,827
Brainwashing...

1287
01:07:40,829 --> 01:07:42,162
Uh, yes!

1288
01:07:42,164 --> 01:07:45,465
I must have been under
some sort of mind control!

1289
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:47,166
I knew it!

1290
01:07:47,168 --> 01:07:49,669
We'll fill you in later but for
now, we have bigger problems.

1291
01:07:49,671 --> 01:07:54,374
The power... I can feel it
coursing through my veins!

1292
01:07:54,376 --> 01:07:55,678
Come on, girls!

1293
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,579
Thank you, Supergirl.

1294
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:03,883
I was looking
for a little super-strength!

1295
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:08,090
My strength!
It's... fading!

1296
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:14,896
What are you doing? No!
Stop!

1297
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,733
Hold on, Ivy!

1298
01:08:20,603 --> 01:08:22,438
How chilling.

1299
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,909
She's absorbing
everyone's powers!

1300
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:30,275
What can we do?

1301
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:32,745
We've all been fighting
against each other for so long,

1302
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:34,448
we haven't gotten anywhere!

1303
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,717
What happens
when we fight together?

1304
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,485
Super Hero High School rules
on three!

1305
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:44,291
One, two,
Super Hero High School rules!

1306
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:46,092
I have an idea. Follow me!

1307
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,497
Retreating? So soon?

1308
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:53,902
You girls go ahead.
We'll distract them.

1309
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:01,475
What is that? Is that...

1310
01:09:01,477 --> 01:09:03,276
Sounds like motors.

1311
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:23,799
Who needs superpowers
when you've got these? Yahoo!

1312
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,803
Okay, Frost! Soften her up!

1313
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,041
Snowballs? Now that
Lena has Supergirl's strength,

1314
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:36,746
you're gonna need
to do better than that.

1315
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:39,916
Ivy, grab a hold!

1316
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:43,851
What are you doing?

1317
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:46,118
Okay, Harley.
Do your thing!

1318
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,656
With pleasure!

1319
01:09:51,393 --> 01:09:54,159
Pliers, finish her off!

1320
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:56,798
All right, team.
Let's pull her over!

1321
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:03,806
It's over, Lena!

1322
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:09,778
Over? It's just beginning.

1323
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:13,680
The necklace. Yes!

1324
01:10:13,682 --> 01:10:15,649
This was the final piece.

1325
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:17,316
What is that?

1326
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:18,985
The necklace of Wotan.

1327
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:21,053
Doctor Fate told us
to retrieve it.

1328
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:23,757
He said that it was an
object of unlimited power,

1329
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:25,758
and help the school
in its hour of need.

1330
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,596
Yes. Yes! I can feel it!

1331
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:32,168
Wait!
What is it doing?

1332
01:10:33,869 --> 01:10:35,804
Looks like
Doctor Fate was right.

1333
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:41,374
My strength is returning.

1334
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:42,708
So are my powers!

1335
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,909
<i>Mine too!</i>

1336
01:10:46,548 --> 01:10:48,382
What? The power
of laughter.

1337
01:10:48,384 --> 01:10:50,883
Well, I guess it's all
is well that ends well.

1338
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:53,921
Bah! You think I don't
have contingencies?

1339
01:10:53,923 --> 01:10:57,626
Lena Luthor always has
a backup plan!

1340
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:10,937
Now no longer will we be
called Uber High,

1341
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:16,144
but the home base
for the Legion of Doom!

1342
01:11:28,823 --> 01:11:30,989
A giant flying ship?

1343
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:32,493
- Been there.
- Done that.

1344
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:33,829
Will do it again.

1345
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:41,802
After you.

1346
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:43,203
No, no. I insist.

1347
01:11:43,205 --> 01:11:47,141
- No, please.
- Oh, come on!

1348
01:11:47,143 --> 01:11:50,677
A little friendly competition
never hurt no one.

1349
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,648
That's one for me!

1350
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:00,686
One for me too!

1351
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:02,157
Me three!

1352
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:08,127
<i>You can't hit
what you can't see!</i>

1353
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,998
Huh? What? No!

1354
01:12:24,745 --> 01:12:26,281
Now, everyone up!

1355
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:36,826
<i>Round
and round she goes!</i>

1356
01:12:38,093 --> 01:12:41,363
Where she stops,
nobody knows!

1357
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:52,338
Shouldn't you girls be
in class?

1358
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:55,141
Lena? Not this time, lady!

1359
01:12:55,143 --> 01:12:56,809
No, Supergirl!

1360
01:12:56,811 --> 01:12:58,945
That's the real
Principal Waller!

1361
01:12:58,947 --> 01:13:02,082
Oh. Sorry.

1362
01:13:02,084 --> 01:13:03,615
I don't know
what's going on

1363
01:13:03,617 --> 01:13:06,185
butt I want some
answers right now!

1364
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:08,387
It's my fault,
Principal Waller!

1365
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:11,257
I was teaching them
the virtues of competition

1366
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:12,958
here in the open air!

1367
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,694
But what I found out is

1368
01:13:14,696 --> 01:13:16,896
that while competition is good,

1369
01:13:16,898 --> 01:13:20,100
it's not as good as learning
to work together.

1370
01:13:20,102 --> 01:13:22,636
Very well. But from
now on, please keep

1371
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:25,341
these little sparring
matches in the gymnasium.

1372
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:29,642
You heard the lady.

1373
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:32,078
Who's up for a little
group sparring match!

1374
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,815
Sure. But maybe this time,
we'll mix up the teams.

1375
01:13:35,817 --> 01:13:38,051
That's a great idea!

1376
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:41,954
I bet I can make even more
off a rematch!

1377
01:13:41,956 --> 01:13:43,356
I'll take that bet.

1378
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:45,190
- Hey!
- And I'll take that money!

1379
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:48,194
Uh, I was totally gonna
give that to you.

1380
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:50,065
Honest!

1381
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:08,347
Well, that didn't go as planned.
What do we do now?

1382
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:11,217
What you always do
with an empty base.

1383
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:14,421
Fill it. Bring me my Rolodex!

1384
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:15,689
What's a Rolodex?

1385
01:14:15,691 --> 01:14:17,858
Never mind.

1386
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,124
Kids.

1387
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,860
I'll just log on
to Villainbook.

1388
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:22,794
I'm sure someone is
looking to team up.

1389
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:23,997
I can team up.

1390
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,865
We are teamed up.
We need more people.

1391
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:28,568
<i>I know people.</i>

1392
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,169
- <i>Dumb people.</i>
- <i>What did you say?</i>

1393
01:14:30,171 --> 01:14:33,142
<i>I'm doomed!</i>

1394
01:14:37,197 --> 01:14:42,197
