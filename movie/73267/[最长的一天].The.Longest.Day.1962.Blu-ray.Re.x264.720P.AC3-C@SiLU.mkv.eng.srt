1
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,433
London calling, with Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.

2
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,503
Take a look at that. What a handsome sight...

3
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,210
...the pride of the Third Reich.

4
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:41,417
The brave sergeant taking coffee to the beachgunners.

5
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:46,949
So that's a sample of the master race in a pig's eye.

6
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,327
What's going on here?

7
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:36,314
In this darkest hour, in the gloom of night...

8
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:38,441
...we must not despair.

9
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:44,746
Let us keep our faith intact,unswerving!

10
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,326
For each of us...

11
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:51,365
...deliverance is coming.

12
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,000
We need mines and obstacles along the whole coast.

13
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,197
At every beach, on every dune...

14
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:28,707
...on every rock.

15
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:31,006
How many have been installed?

16
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,807
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.

17
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,413
It has to be six million by May.

18
00:04:36,788 --> 00:04:40,645
-Six million.
-Our men are constantly deployed.

19
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,193
There's no point in even discussing rest.

20
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:46,661
-The troops are completely exhausted.
-My dear Herr von Salmuth...

21
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,824
...which would your troops rather be...

22
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,094
...exhausted or dead?

23
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,329
Just look at it, gentlemen.

24
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,899
How calm, how peaceful it is.

25
00:04:56,344 --> 00:05:00,007
A strip of water between England and the Continent...

26
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,237
...between the Allies and us.

27
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:08,249
But beyond that peaceful horizon, a monster waits.

28
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:12,288
A coiled spring of men, ships and planes...

29
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:15,620
...straining to be released against us.

30
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,996
But not a single Allied soldier shall reach the shore.

31
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:25,199
Not a single Anglo-American shall set foot on the beaches.

32
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:30,268
Whenever or wherever this invasion may come, gentlemen...

33
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,814
...I shall destroy the enemy there, at the water's edge.

34
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,580
Believe me, gentlemen.

35
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:42,282
The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive.

36
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,429
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

37
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,801
...the longest day.

38
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,444
-The poem by Verlaine?
-Yes, the first verse.

39
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:30,148
Play it back!

40
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:32,806
Silence!

41
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,756
Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.

42
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:48,755
Here are some personal messages.

43
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:55,639
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn. "

44
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,137
I repeat:

45
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:01,144
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn. "

46
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:05,281
Have you notified all commands?

47
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:20,292
If Berlin is right, when we intercept the second verse...

48
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,805
...it will mean the invasion will come within 24 hours.

49
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,409
Give me the text of the second verse.

50
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,090
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."

51
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:53,962
We've intercepted hundreds of messages in the last year, hundreds!

52
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:57,375
I've ordered alerts again and again.

53
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:01,642
Why should this poem mean more than other messages?

54
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:03,309
Tell me this:

55
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:08,186
Does it give us any clue as to where they will land and when?

56
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,727
Of course it doesn't.

57
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,555
I have half a million men under my command.

58
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:19,760
How can I maintain discipline
if I keep my troops on the alert...

59
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,700
...just because a pair of nitwits in Berlin intercept a poem?

60
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,873
No, Blumentritt, no alert.

61
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,283
And especially not in this weather.

62
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,921
-Anything else?
-No, sir.

63
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,739
Good morning, field marshal.

64
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:58,880
-Any news?
-Nothing important.

65
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:01,884
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-Calais yesterday afternoon.

66
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:05,421
Nothing much happened last night. The storm.

67
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,447
That's all I'm interested in this morning, the storm.

68
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:15,157
It came from nowhere, blew my roses to bits.

69
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:19,031
There are 5-foot waves in the Channel...

70
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,869
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.

71
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,575
For the month of June...

72
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,306
...it's the worst Channel storm in 20 years.

73
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,950
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?

74
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:34,681
General Jodl will see the Fuhrer today...

75
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:37,655
...and confirm the appointment for you.

76
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:42,559
Will you still go to Germany as planned?

77
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:45,361
Can you think of a better time?

78
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:50,966
The weather is expected to continue like this for another week.

79
00:10:37,128 --> 00:10:40,017
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

80
00:10:41,032 --> 00:10:44,422
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

81
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,503
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

82
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:50,039
You expect us to eat this slop again?

83
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,141
I don't care what you do with it, mac.

84
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,109
Eat it, throw it out.

85
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,872
I get paid for cooking it.

86
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,844
Come on. Put it on.

87
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,712
Snap it up.

88
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,355
Jerk the lead.

89
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,389
Didn't you get any sleep?

90
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:08,552
Are you kidding? I haven't slept since we got here.

91
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,193
I got the absolute lowdown.

92
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:16,433
It's on for tonight. For sure.

93
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:17,970
Yeah.

94
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:21,569
I got in this crap game with this guy from F Company.

95
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,610
-He's an orderly for some general.
-Move it. Move it.

96
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,052
Hey, Hutchy!

97
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,346
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.

98
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,750
Hey, Hutchinson...

99
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,725
...do you think they'd let me writehome?
If it was really important?

100
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,959
Not likely, mate. Security.

101
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,432
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

102
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,301
It's the wife, you see. She's going to have a baby.

103
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:49,702
Your first, is it?

104
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,141
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead worried about her.

105
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,576
She's not too strong, you see.

106
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,775
Man, that stink.

107
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:28,441
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.

108
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,881
And there ain't no place left to get sick in.

109
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,421
The puke bags is full.

110
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,926
The fire buckets is full.

111
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:40,926
All we got left is our helmets.

112
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:44,793
June.

113
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:51,672
Every June my old man used to take me camping...

114
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,410
...up in the Blue Mountains.

115
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,653
We'd hunt and fish all day long.

116
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:04,154
And at night...

117
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,117
...we'd sleep out under the stars.

118
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,895
Didn't even need a blanket.

119
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,109
June.

120
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,945
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

121
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:28,552
Don't it ever stop?

122
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:31,916
Look, Dad, all I want to do is get going.

123
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:36,324
Wind or no wind. Even if we land in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

124
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,020
-Come to think of it--
-Colonel wants us.

125
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,930
All of us.

126
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,444
I've notified the adjutant, change in schedule.

127
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:55,049
After briefing session today...

128
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:58,780
...all troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

129
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,978
In this weather, sir?

130
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,652
Of course, Harding,
if you can ensure that we'll land in France...

131
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:08,491
-...in sunshine and dry weather.
-Didn't mean that.

132
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,100
-What did you mean?
-It isn't the weather.

133
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,330
It's the waiting. These men are itching to go.

134
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,963
I don't think I have to remind you...

135
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:20,576
...that this war has been going on for almost five years.

136
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:23,180
Half of Europe has been overrun and occupied.

137
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,874
We're comparative newcomers.

138
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:30,376
England's gone through a blitz
with a knife at her throat since 1940.

139
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:34,824
I am quite sure that they too are impatient and itching to go.

140
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,894
Do I make myself clear?

141
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,691
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

142
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:42,696
Three million men penned up on this island.

143
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,636
All over England, in staging areas like this.

144
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:51,007
We're on the threshold of the most crucial day of our times.

145
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:53,443
Three million men out there...

146
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:58,542
...keyed up, and waiting for that big step-off.

147
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,120
They aren't exactly alone.

148
00:15:04,664 --> 00:15:07,656
Notify the men. Full packs and equipment, 1400 hours.

149
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:09,026
Yes, sir.

150
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,832
They said they have both issues available.

151
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:17,136
I prefer this type. It allows you more freedom.

152
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:20,474
Quicker to get rid of when we hit the beach.

153
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:23,139
-Well?
-It's on.

154
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,144
Tonight, as scheduled.

155
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,189
-If the weather isn't worse.
-How worse can it get?

156
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:32,589
Ike has called a high-level conference for 9:30.

157
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:37,061
I am not Eisenhower. I am an assistant division commander.

158
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:41,998
I don't know from nothing, but he can't call it off again.

159
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:47,510
Frank, turn that thing off.

160
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,101
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

161
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,907
Troops ready to go.

162
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,949
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

163
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,748
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

164
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,049
Norm, relax.

165
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,758
RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began.

166
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,296
So they told us yesterday and the day before.

167
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:09,025
Look, Norm.

168
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,259
We're all of us just as...

169
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,032
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

170
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,236
And that includes Ike.

171
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,405
Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing.

172
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:24,314
Of course he does. I know that.

173
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,286
I'm just thinking about those assault troops.
200,000 of them...

174
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,881
...out there on those ships. They're probably seasick as hell.

175
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,917
Some of those men have been on
those tubs for almost three days.

176
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,396
I say go.

177
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,231
Go. Weather or no weather.

178
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,469
No!

179
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,943
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

180
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:52,106
-Hey, give me 50 bucks. I'm busted.
-I'm not doing so good myself.

181
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,025
Hey, lend me 50 bucks?

182
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,795
-Lend me 20 bucks?
-Drop dead.

183
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:18,312
Lend me 10?

184
00:17:25,656 --> 00:17:27,180
-Fifty on a bet.
-I got it.

185
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,449
One, two, three, four, five.

186
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,355
Fifty!

187
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,353
Let me hear it, let me hear it.

188
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,058
-Five and two, four and three.
-Six! That's the way we go!

189
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,729
Seven points in a row.It ain't logical, it just ain't logical.

190
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:47,868
-There's 100 out there.
-A hundred dollars, $20.

191
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,639
Anything open?

192
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,806
-Forty more.
-Forty more.

193
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,680
You got a bet.

194
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:58,016
-Okay, you mother-loving--
-Just a minute. Wait a minute.

195
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,552
Here you are. Use this.

196
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:03,220
-You don't think l'd--
-I don't think anything.

197
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,764
I just like to hear the sound when it comes out of the cup.

198
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:10,629
That's it. Shake it.

199
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,467
Okay. Let me see what you do with it now.  Go ahead. Shoot.

200
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,236
-What is it?
-Nothing.

201
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,381
-Seven!
-That's what I wanted!

202
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,880
Who put this cup in the game?

203
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:24,883
-Next shooter. Who's coming up?
-I'll go $100.

204
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,684
He's shooting 100.
Who's got it?

205
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,259
-Watch your side bets.
-A hundred dollars.

206
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:34,594
You got a letter for me. Schultz, huh?

207
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,968
Yeah, that's it.

208
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,765
Thanks, buddy.

209
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:52,915
-How much did you take him for?
-Not much. Just a hair over 2500.

210
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:55,487
-Twenty-five hundred?
-Yeah.

211
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:58,091
Oh, man, 2500?

212
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,388
It's too bad you had to win it now.

213
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:03,126
What do you mean, now?

214
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,427
Suppose we take off tonight.  What will you do with it?

215
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:11,968
Five I take with me to Paris to blow on the broads and wine.

216
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:14,600
A thou I leave here for seed when I get back.

217
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,972
And the rest I send to my mother.

218
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,798
Oh, man, 2500. And in Paris.

219
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:44,670
You always was lucky.

220
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,769
Hey, remember that night in Fort Bragg?

221
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,217
I remember it.

222
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:56,114
You know, I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

223
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:58,315
Why not? What's to lose?

224
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,455
Damn it.

225
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,159
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

226
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,672
I was lucky, all right, in that crap game.

227
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,572
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

228
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,348
And two months in traction.

229
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,558
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

230
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:41,801
That's more money I ever had in my whole life.

231
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,074
I know.

232
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:52,314
Man, I just know.

233
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:09,031
I wonder how long it takes to lose $2500.

234
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,450
Pint of sludge, Ted.

235
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,596
Oh, hello, Dave. Hey, you seen Johnny?

236
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,063
Yes.

237
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,670
Well, where is he?

238
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,099
Come on, Dave.

239
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,910
I need my boots. Johnny's borrowed them.

240
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:47,143
Where is he?

241
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,184
At the bottom...

242
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,012
...of the Channel.

243
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,360
You mean...

244
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:04,364
...he's bought it?

245
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,868
Ack-ack over Calais.

246
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:11,101
He jumped clean, ut his parachute didn't open.

247
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,278
That leaves just you in the squadron, Dave.

248
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:26,951
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.

249
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,996
What's always worried me about being one of the few...

250
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,794
...is the way we keep on getting fewer.

251
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:35,667
Yeah.

252
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:37,765
Poor old Johnny.

253
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:40,773
Bad luck, it happening now.

254
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:45,437
-Now, then. What's the difference?
-He went through the Battle of Britain just like you!

255
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,017
And now if the big show starts tonight...

256
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:52,144
...he won't be in it.

257
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:55,085
Look, will you please shut up about him?

258
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,660
All right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

259
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,162
You heard something about tonight?

260
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:03,325
No, no. I haven't heard anything.

261
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:06,768
-What are you talking about then?
-Well, it's just....

262
00:23:07,141 --> 00:23:10,474
-Go on, go on.
-I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

263
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:13,169
-That's all.
-A feeling.

264
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:15,672
Take your feeling somewhere else.

265
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:18,613
I've got a letter to write.

266
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,516
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

267
00:23:21,991 --> 00:23:23,879
I've had it with me all day long.

268
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:26,359
I can't shake it off.

269
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:30,227
It's tonight. I know it is.

270
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,229
All right, it's tonight.

271
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:33,801
Suits me fine.

272
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,872
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

273
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,268
I mean...

274
00:23:41,914 --> 00:23:44,178
...as soon as I finish this beer.

275
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,164
-General, can you spare me a minute?
-Come in.

276
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,098
-Thank you.
-Can I get you coffee?

277
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:05,567
-No, thanks.
-I'll get some for myself.

278
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:17,812
Is it still raining?

279
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,613
On and off, off and on.

280
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,449
Sometimes I wonder which side God's on.

281
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,717
What?

282
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:28,350
I say, sometimes I wonder which side God's on.

283
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,856
Good question.

284
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,593
What's on your mind, Van?

285
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,865
I'm concerned about the placement of our drop zones.

286
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,337
Go on.

287
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:41,138
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

288
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:43,679
...but you've given me a tough nut to crack.

289
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:47,443
-It gets tougher every time I try.
-I know, Van.

290
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:51,182
Sainte-Mere-Eglise straddles the only road
the Germans can use...

291
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,918
...to drive into our northern flank. But it has to be taken.

292
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,286
And it has to be held.

293
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:01,125
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

294
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,901
-Can I use your board?
-Of course.

295
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:14,910
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

296
00:25:15,153 --> 00:25:18,543
Down here is the swamp area that
the Germans have flooded.

297
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:22,511
And in between, four miles from the town, is our drop zone.

298
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:25,323
Now, if anything goes wrong and we undershoot...

299
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:28,419
...we land in this flooded area and are bogged down.

300
00:25:28,668 --> 00:25:31,899
If we overshoot, we come down like clay pigeons...

301
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:35,062
...smack dab in the center of Sainte-Mere-Eglise.

302
00:25:35,276 --> 00:25:39,838
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

303
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:41,639
So I've heard.

304
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:47,546
Got a complaint from the city council at Bexhall.

305
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:52,386
Some of your men overshot the drop zone
and landed in the town.

306
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:56,384
-Tied up traffic for an hour.
-That's true, sir. I was with them.

307
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:59,497
Sudden crosswind hit us, swept us over the treetops...

308
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,762
...scattered us all over the place.

309
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,399
-Where did you end up?
-In the courtyard of a convent.

310
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,405
Relax, Van. Sit down.

311
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:16,743
The last few months have been a tough grind on all of us.

312
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,621
I hear you've been working yourself and your battalion hard.

313
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,886
Almost without a stop.

314
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:27,093
Now that we're almost at the end of the line...

315
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:30,600
...why don't you try easing up on yourself and on the men?

316
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:34,666
Sometimes a battalion can be sharpened to too fine a point.

317
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:37,965
Sometimes a commander can too.

318
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,407
Well...

319
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:46,445
...if there's any further delay...

320
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,422
...I request permission to
submit a new placement for our drop zones.

321
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,787
All right. Put it in writing.

322
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:55,361
Make it official. That's your prerogative.

323
00:26:56,133 --> 00:27:01,093
But Ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

324
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,201
If it's on, we'll get the green light by 9:30.

325
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:07,207
-What are the chances?
-Better than 50-50.

326
00:27:07,614 --> 00:27:11,436
Forget everything I said.
I got the best battalion in this division...

327
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:12,880
...and they're ready.

328
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,900
Here it is. The latest report.

329
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:52,516
-It's Southwick House, sir.
-Stagg here.

330
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:56,558
Yes, sir. The new front's moving
in much faster than we thought.

331
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,902
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

332
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:03,703
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.

333
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:13,880
-Would you like some more tea, sir?
-Coffee, and make it black.

334
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:15,146
Please.

335
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,454
One moment, Colonel Priller.

336
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:20,353
Why wasn't he court-martialed?

337
00:28:20,562 --> 00:28:22,518
He shot down 132 planes.

338
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,292
Hello, Pips, old boy.

339
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:29,460
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."

340
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:33,129
You were a rotten pilot when we flew in Russia.

341
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:36,904
You're flying a desk now, but you're still a rotten pilot!

342
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,180
What's that you're saying?

343
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,674
I'm squatting here on this God-forsaken airfield...

344
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:49,383
...with only two planes, two stinking crates!

345
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:54,430
Oh, sure, sure, your orders were followed!

346
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,931
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!

347
00:28:57,437 --> 00:29:02,568
My supplies are all gone. What am I supposed to do now?

348
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:07,976
But Pips, we had to disperse our fighter squadrons. We had to!

349
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:12,505
Look what happened to our airstrips around the Pas-de-Calais!

350
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:15,554
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

351
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:19,951
You move us back instead of forward!

352
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:25,122
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...

353
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:28,463
...but what would happen if they did?

354
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:32,836
But you know I can't get there with my equipment for two days.

355
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,705
I tell you, you're all crazy!

356
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,326
Priller has always been a hothead...

357
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:00,335
...but let's not underestimate him.

358
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:04,075
What he says is not entirely illogical.

359
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:06,842
What's the weather report?

360
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,379
Slightly better over the Channel.

361
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,549
I wouldn't be surprised if--

362
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:18,146
-When's the next weather report?
-Tonight at 8, general.

363
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:21,619
Keep me posted on the weather.

364
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,726
You made my dinner reservations?

365
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:26,731
Yes, I did, general.

366
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,632
Cancel everything.

367
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:41,380
-Have you got them?
-Yes, sir.

368
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:42,646
Let me have them.

369
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,487
Shoes for my wife, I had them specially made in Paris...

370
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:53,586
...for her birthday, tomorrow, the sixth of June.

371
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,191
Please wish her a happy birthday.

372
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:57,860
Thank you, Speidel.

373
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:04,467
Why didn't they attack in May? The weather was perfect....

374
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,070
Tides were right, and now....

375
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,511
An attack now would be embarrassing.

376
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:15,010
Let's go. But I don't think we need worry.

377
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:39,043
Is the plan ready, sir?

378
00:31:39,553 --> 00:31:42,909
Yes, yes, quite finished.

379
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,083
War games...

380
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,961
...theoretical invasions.

381
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:56,960
Rush to Rennes just to push little flags around a table.

382
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:01,834
Playing at war!

383
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,276
Do you win or lose, sir?

384
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:09,108
Have I ever lost?

385
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:17,883
But general, this time you play the role of Eisenhower.

386
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:21,896
I win because I go against the rules.

387
00:32:23,036 --> 00:32:26,699
We expect them
to cross at the narrowest part of the Channel...

388
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:31,797
...and in good weather. But that's too simple, too obvious.

389
00:32:32,013 --> 00:32:37,110
I choose the widest part, in the worst weather,
and attack here.

390
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,676
In Normandy.

391
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:41,714
And in bad weather!

392
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,324
Like now...

393
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:49,291
...bad weather!

394
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:52,929
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

395
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:58,368
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

396
00:32:58,576 --> 00:32:59,770
And Normandy?

397
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,572
High winds, clouds, and some fog over the beaches.

398
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:07,909
However, I can say with a certain degree of safety...

399
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,384
...that we can expect a brief period of fair conditions.

400
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,613
Let me summarize, then.

401
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,018
What you're promising us is
a barely tolerable period of fair conditions.

402
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,355
Am I right?

403
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,693
Yes.

404
00:33:21,902 --> 00:33:25,531
Conditions that are far below the minimum requirements.

405
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,163
That's all I can promise.

406
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,766
You've done your best, Stagg. Thank you, gentlemen.

407
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:39,552
Well, there it is.

408
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,282
We've postponed the attack once already.

409
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:47,954
Now, either we go on the sixth,
with only marginal conditions...

410
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,763
...or postpone again...

411
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:53,692
...in the hope of getting perfect conditions.

412
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,599
What do you think, Monty?

413
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:57,901
I say, go. Go.

414
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,408
I must remind everybody...

415
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:04,503
...that the American convoy for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

416
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,616
...they've farthest to go...

417
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,119
...must be given the order within the next half-hour...

418
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:13,487
...if the assault is to take place on the sixth.

419
00:34:17,064 --> 00:34:20,625
We can't keep almost a quarter of a million men on ships...

420
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:23,824
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.

421
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:28,167
The longer we wait, the more acute our security problem.

422
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,138
The next time...

423
00:34:30,346 --> 00:34:32,871
...the tides and the moon will be right....

424
00:34:36,153 --> 00:34:37,745
Not before July.

425
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:42,687
Gentlemen...

426
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,617
...such a postponement...

427
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,025
...is too bitter to contemplate.

428
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:57,968
A brilliant plan, general. Unorthodox, but brilliant.

429
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,176
Fortunately, it's only a game.

430
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,579
I don't think we have much to worry about.

431
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,584
Eisenhower would never take the gamble.

432
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:14,794
Never.

433
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:22,898
I'm quite positive we must give the order.

434
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,864
I don't like it...

435
00:35:26,342 --> 00:35:27,969
...but there it is.

436
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:29,774
Gentlemen...

437
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:34,744
...I don't see how we can possibly do anything else but go.

438
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:53,230
Wilson speaking.

439
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:55,340
Yes, sir.

440
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,846
It's on, sir. Ike's made the decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

441
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,499
Colonel Tomson speaking.

442
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:24,632
Thank you.

443
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:30,979
Next stop...

444
00:36:31,283 --> 00:36:32,739
...Normandy.

445
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:36,746
God help us now.

446
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:48,096
Lovat here.

447
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:55,670
Gentlemen...

448
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,299
...the day we've been waiting for has arrived.

449
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,408
Invasion! We're on our way.

450
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:09,090
General.

451
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,823
The orders have been given. It's on.

452
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,800
Have the battalion commanders join me in the wardroom.

453
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,740
All right, sergeant.

454
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,818
You men are the eyes of our airborne Army.

455
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:41,985
You, the pathfinders, will have one job, and one job only:

456
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:45,995
To light the drop zones for our paratroops.

457
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:49,967
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

458
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:53,003
...to land in France.  And remember this:

459
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,005
When you get to Normandy...

460
00:37:55,478 --> 00:37:57,605
...you'll only have one friend:

461
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,541
God.

462
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:04,515
And this.

463
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:09,185
This...

464
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:11,484
...is Rupert.

465
00:38:12,997 --> 00:38:15,295
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...

466
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,364
...and a lot more like him...

467
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,595
...behind the invasion area.

468
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:23,265
He's...

469
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:26,503
...a very extraordinary fellow, Rupert.

470
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:29,375
He's a sort of...

471
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,040
...one-man army, all by himself.

472
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,317
Let me show you.

473
00:38:36,257 --> 00:38:38,623
Let me show you what happens when Rupert...

474
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,350
...hits the ground.

475
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:42,594
Sergeant, switch off the lights, please.

476
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,398
All right, sergeant, that's all.

477
00:38:53,276 --> 00:38:55,141
All right, come on. Simmer down.

478
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:56,573
Come on, up.

479
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:06,045
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

480
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:09,180
Confuse them, make them look over their shoulders...

481
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,988
...and launch an attack in the wrong direction.

482
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,106
Ten-hut!

483
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,645
-The crickets have been distributed.
-So I heard.

484
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:30,981
At ease!

485
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:36,222
You're as ready as we can make you.

486
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,821
This five-cent toy...

487
00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:42,854
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

488
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:45,021
It may save your life.

489
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:47,800
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

490
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:51,130
On the other side of that hedgerow...

491
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:55,869
...the fellow may not be wearing the same uniform you are. So...

492
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:57,705
...one click...

493
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:00,610
...is to be answered by two clicks.

494
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,185
And if you don't get that answering click...

495
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:07,751
...hit the dirt and open fire.

496
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:09,018
I repeat:

497
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,060
One click...

498
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:13,525
...must be answered by two clicks.

499
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:18,490
Now, hang on to this gimmick.It's as important as your weapon.

500
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:22,603
-Do you read me?
-Loud and clear, sir.

501
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,039
All right. One more thing.

502
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,871
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

503
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,042
You can't give the enemy a break.

504
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,185
Send them to hell.

505
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,357
That is all.

506
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:53,832
This is London calling. This is our eighth news bulletin.

507
00:40:54,446 --> 00:40:57,938
Here are some personal messages.

508
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:03,076
"Molasses tomorrow will bring forth cognac. "

509
00:41:03,256 --> 00:41:07,522
"Molasses tomorrow will bring forth cognac. "

510
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:10,626
"John has a long mustache. "

511
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:11,923
I repeat:

512
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,054
"John has a long mustache. "

513
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,732
"John has a long mustache! "

514
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:23,301
"John has a long mustache! "

515
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,878
"John has a long mustache!"

516
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,247
No, not yet....

517
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,925
Oh, my Lord!

518
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:02,719
"John has a long mustache."

519
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:35,557
Make any sense to you, mac?

520
00:42:35,994 --> 00:42:40,260
As I said last night,
they're code messages to the Resistance chaps.

521
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:43,422
Obviously,
one message means something to one group...

522
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:46,001
...and another means something to another group.

523
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:52,231
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

524
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:54,343
I repeat:

525
00:42:56,885 --> 00:43:01,447
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

526
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:06,249
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor. "

527
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:07,589
I repeat:

528
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,926
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor. "

529
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:27,474
The bridge, in 45 minutes.

530
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:38,762
We' ll be back.

531
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:50,702
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor. "

532
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:52,811
I repeat:

533
00:43:53,014 --> 00:43:56,871
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor. "

534
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:02,411
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

535
00:44:13,872 --> 00:44:16,432
The best hand I've had all night.

536
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,904
Let me see here....

537
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:24,446
Pardon me.

538
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:28,678
Pardon me, general, it's come.

539
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:31,288
Wait. Give that to me.

540
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,019
What's come?

541
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,021
It's the second part of the message.

542
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:37,619
-Verlaine.
-Yes. The second verse.

543
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:40,628
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."

544
00:44:42,004 --> 00:44:44,632
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."

545
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,975
We can expect the invasion within 24 hours!

546
00:44:51,848 --> 00:44:54,146
Put the 15th Army on full alert.

547
00:44:56,654 --> 00:44:58,019
Thank you.

548
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:10,853
You know, I'm too old a bunny
to get very excited about all this.

549
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:15,563
Now, where was I? Oh, yes, two spades!

550
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:45,128
It's almost impossible to believe.

551
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,268
Every dot represents a ship.

552
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:52,540
You got battlewagons, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers.

553
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,880
You got assault craft of every size and every type.

554
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,684
The biggest armada the world's ever known.

555
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:07,163
Here.

556
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:11,897
You remember it.

557
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:14,434
Remember every bit of it.

558
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,634
We're on the eve of a day...

559
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:20,610
...that people will talk about long after we're dead and gone.

560
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,887
You wanna know something?

561
00:46:34,797 --> 00:46:37,755
It gives me goose pimples just to be part of it.

562
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:51,269
You could call it one of them...

563
00:46:51,482 --> 00:46:54,508
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages, you know?

564
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:57,950
Met at a dance at the USO and all that...

565
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,155
...but, I mean, I took it serious.

566
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:03,624
And so did she. We didn't do it just for kicks.

567
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,660
-When did you get the letter?
-Week ago.

568
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,992
Two weeks.

569
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:12,967
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

570
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:17,032
I mean, she's a high-class model and all, and l....

571
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:22,872
I'm not the kind of guy to get married that easy.

572
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,178
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

573
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:35,026
But oh, man, we really had some wonderful times together.

574
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,863
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

575
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:43,830
Well, she never actually said so....

576
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:45,773
I mean....

577
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,877
You think I was right? I mean, was I fair?

578
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:55,074
She can't get one without your permission, right?

579
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,152
You gotta give your okay.

580
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,947
I know it's the law.

581
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:02,025
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

582
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:12,693
Well, I guess I better be getting back to the outfit.

583
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:17,667
Good luck.

584
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:20,706
You too.

585
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:34,959
Who was that guy? The one you was talking to so long?

586
00:48:37,135 --> 00:48:39,000
I don't know, Sparrow.

587
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,534
I never saw him before in my life.

588
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:09,632
Happy birthday, general, from your staff!

589
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:15,339
Thank you.

590
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:19,841
Will you cut the cake, sir?

591
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:24,010
I trust you don't expect me to eat it too!

592
00:49:50,986 --> 00:49:52,146
What's that?

593
00:49:52,854 --> 00:49:57,086
Dummkopf, that's the "V for victory" sign.
Three dots and a dash.

594
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:02,359
Ain't you never heard Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

595
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:42,831
Release point coming up, Major Howard.

596
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:45,272
Right, prepare for landing.

597
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:46,980
Cutting loose now.

598
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:48,240
Roger and out.

599
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:15,443
Major Howard...

600
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,514
...I cannot overestimate the importance of your task.

601
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,845
The Orne River Bridge must be captured...

602
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:22,952
...before the enemy can destroy it.

603
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:28,014
It's a vital military artery,
and the enemy has prepared it for demolition.

604
00:51:28,595 --> 00:51:32,588
It must be taken by surprise and captured intact.

605
00:51:33,167 --> 00:51:37,228
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.

606
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:40,169
You will assault the garrison, overwhelm it...

607
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:42,536
...and hold until relieved.

608
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:45,171
Hold until relieved.

609
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:46,609
Major Howard!

610
00:51:46,816 --> 00:51:48,511
There's the bridge coming up.

611
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,682
Just on our left.

612
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,396
Right, link your arms.

613
00:52:04,002 --> 00:52:05,196
Brace yourselves.

614
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:29,457
Feet up!

615
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:33,426
Hang on!

616
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:39,401
Smoke screen. Smoke.

617
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:46,108
Up the action, bucks! Up the action, bucks!

618
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,660
Right, Tom. Over the bridge.

619
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,082
Check for demolition charges!

620
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:05,503
Hello! Hello!

621
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,507
Hello! Damn it! Hello!

622
00:55:09,678 --> 00:55:11,703
Hello! Hello!

623
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,754
Clear.

624
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:45,780
It's working!

625
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:48,912
Hello! Hello!

626
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:54,786
-Where's the doc?
-On the third glider.

627
00:55:54,963 --> 00:55:56,692
There's no report from them.

628
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:58,786
-Walsh.
-Sir?

629
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,696
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it. Take over.

630
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:03,769
On the other end of the bridge.

631
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:06,339
-What happened to you?
-Broke it on landing.

632
00:56:06,577 --> 00:56:08,909
-Isn't the doc with you?
-No, he's missing.

633
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:12,502
We crashed in the river. Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

634
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:15,138
I'm all right, sir. So are the boys.

635
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,719
-Okay, carry on.
-Right, sir. Come on!

636
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:43,473
Well, I'll be....

637
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:45,609
Hey, doc! Doc!

638
00:56:46,655 --> 00:56:48,987
What are you doing there? That's the German side.

639
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:52,149
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

640
00:57:02,973 --> 00:57:03,997
Sir?

641
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:07,438
The demolition charges have been removed. It's all clear.

642
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,442
Good. Corporal Smith.

643
00:57:11,216 --> 00:57:15,038
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.

644
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:20,152
-John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
-Right, sir.

645
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,323
All in less than 15 minutes.

646
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:32,902
Only a matter of time before they counterattack.

647
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:37,170
-What about the paratroopers?
-7th Para might not get here for hours.

648
00:57:37,545 --> 00:57:39,638
And Lovat and his commandos....

649
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:42,938
It could be midday before they get here.

650
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,708
The question is, how long can we hold?

651
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,319
Hold until relieved.

652
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,191
Hold until relieved.

653
00:58:00,271 --> 00:58:04,401
What awful weather. It's raining again.

654
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,104
Thank you.

655
00:58:06,745 --> 00:58:08,406
Did you get the list?

656
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:17,544
General Schlieben of the 709th
has already left for the war games.

657
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:23,857
The commander of the 243rd left for Rennes at 1800 hours.

658
00:58:24,064 --> 00:58:25,053
Who else?

659
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:28,760
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd, 12 officers in all.

660
00:58:29,904 --> 00:58:31,895
Yes, I know.

661
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,964
The weather is bad,
so everyone enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

662
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,772
I don't like it.

663
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,380
Any of it.

664
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,782
So many key officers are away at the same time.

665
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,147
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

666
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:51,525
But the war games have been scheduled for a week....

667
00:58:51,763 --> 00:58:55,529
Yes, for tomorrow, not tonight.

668
00:58:57,936 --> 00:59:01,599
Advise all officers who have not yet left for Rennes...

669
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:04,799
...to postpone their departure until tomorrow.

670
00:59:05,111 --> 00:59:07,841
May I remind you, general...

671
00:59:08,114 --> 00:59:11,811
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

672
00:59:11,986 --> 00:59:16,082
North Africa, Sicily, ltaly....

673
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,314
Yes, and always at dawn.

674
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:29,801
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

675
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:32,201
Now, once more, I repeat:

676
00:59:32,742 --> 00:59:36,200
If, for any reason, we fail to hit our drop zones...

677
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,311
...move north by east.

678
00:59:38,682 --> 00:59:40,445
North by east.

679
00:59:40,951 --> 00:59:44,478
The Germans have flooded large swamp areas behind the coast.

680
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:46,850
Avoid them if possible.

681
00:59:47,158 --> 00:59:49,956
We came here to fight, not to swim.

682
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,795
Do you read me?

683
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,295
Loud and clear, sir.

684
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:16,884
How'd you make out?

685
01:00:17,893 --> 01:00:19,758
How did you make out at the game?

686
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:23,996
I lost.

687
01:00:26,202 --> 01:00:28,500
Now we're both jumping clean.

688
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,956
I understand. And when will the field marshal return?

689
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:53,696
I see. Oh, well.

690
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,300
Just a moment.

691
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,697
The radar report.

692
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:05,701
We are getting reports of strong radar interference...

693
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:08,580
...and radio reception is jammed.

694
01:01:10,753 --> 01:01:15,076
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

695
01:01:15,258 --> 01:01:17,055
And the--

696
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,594
Call the OB West? Very well.

697
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:24,692
Give my respects to the field marshal when he returns.

698
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,264
Bye, Rupert. Do your duty for God, king, and your country.

699
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:09,346
Call for reinforcements! We're under attack!

700
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:14,681
Forward! Board! Fast!

701
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,571
-Are we late?
-No, but...

702
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:36,341
...we must hurry!

703
01:05:48,266 --> 01:05:49,460
What is it?

704
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:58,333
I'll go.

705
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:19,191
Stop!

706
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,595
We said, stop!

707
01:06:22,005 --> 01:06:23,996
Stop, or I'll shoot!

708
01:06:28,878 --> 01:06:30,106
What are you doing here?

709
01:06:30,914 --> 01:06:33,007
I live in that farm.

710
01:06:33,684 --> 01:06:36,642
Nobody lives in that farm.

711
01:06:37,922 --> 01:06:40,618
-It's abandoned.
-Show me your papers.

712
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,616
Hurry up!

713
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:50,462
Come with me.

714
01:06:50,936 --> 01:06:52,130
Go on!

715
01:07:31,717 --> 01:07:33,708
Put your bicycle there.

716
01:07:34,653 --> 01:07:35,847
Hans!

717
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:38,818
Hans, where are you?

718
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:43,321
-What's going on here?
-Nothing!

719
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:46,353
Who is with you? I want to know!

720
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,007
Stop!

721
01:07:57,445 --> 01:07:58,742
Stop!

722
01:08:11,595 --> 01:08:12,857
Stop!

723
01:08:17,668 --> 01:08:20,592
Stop! Stop!

724
01:09:09,159 --> 01:09:11,457
Good luck at the war games, general.

725
01:09:14,165 --> 01:09:15,928
Anything important?

726
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:19,989
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

727
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:23,329
The Underground again!

728
01:09:24,176 --> 01:09:28,601
Some sort of rubber dummies have been dropped by parachute.

729
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:30,672
Rubber dummies!

730
01:09:32,552 --> 01:09:34,474
Connect me with General Richter!

731
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:39,717
We can expect commando raids and other diversionary tactics...

732
01:09:41,697 --> 01:09:45,224
...but I don't like this idea of dummy parachutists.

733
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:49,967
Marcks speaking. Yes.

734
01:09:51,341 --> 01:09:53,832
Are you certain?

735
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,466
How many?

736
01:09:57,047 --> 01:09:58,639
What do you think of it?

737
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:02,713
Thank you, Richter.

738
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:08,145
Paratroopers reported here, here and here!

739
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:12,696
Put it over there.

740
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:23,402
This is what they dropped,
they explode on contact with the earth.

741
01:10:23,744 --> 01:10:26,167
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

742
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:31,645
Perhaps these are what General Richter saw,
not real paratroopers.

743
01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:45,894
When you create a diversion, it's for a reason.

744
01:10:46,102 --> 01:10:48,900
Connect me with General Pemsel!

745
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:54,403
Dummies...?!

746
01:10:54,912 --> 01:10:56,539
Rubber dummies!

747
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:03,410
I agree with you, general.
I'll call you back.

748
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:07,656
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

749
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,624
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

750
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:13,220
Colonel Helmdach is trying to re-route the call.

751
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:17,133
They wouldn't drop dummies...

752
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:20,228
...unless it was to divert our attention from something else.

753
01:11:20,441 --> 01:11:21,931
In this weather?

754
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:23,735
In any kind of weather!

755
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,937
I must get in touch with OB West.

756
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:24,103
They're enemy paratroopers!

757
01:12:38,328 --> 01:12:40,216
Blimey, mate...

758
01:12:40,532 --> 01:12:43,524
...you'll wake up the whole blooming German Army!

759
01:13:20,577 --> 01:13:21,805
Fellas!

760
01:13:22,078 --> 01:13:23,773
I'm hung up!

761
01:13:24,414 --> 01:13:25,506
Fellas!

762
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:39,393
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

763
01:15:17,742 --> 01:15:19,539
Where have you come from?

764
01:15:21,714 --> 01:15:23,409
Awfully sorry, old man.

765
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:25,843
Simply landed here by accident.

766
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:33,881
What's that?

767
01:15:34,761 --> 01:15:37,753
Sorry I startled you. I'm trying to find my communion set.

768
01:15:37,965 --> 01:15:41,389
-Your what?
-My communion set. I've lost it.

769
01:15:41,736 --> 01:15:44,534
Now listen, padre. We've got no time to look for--

770
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,446
I'm sure that it was here that I lost it.

771
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:16,763
We're under fire, padre. Don't you think we ought to--?

772
01:16:16,976 --> 01:16:20,639
You go on, my boy. Go on. I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

773
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:24,978
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

774
01:16:29,424 --> 01:16:31,255
I've got it! I've got it!

775
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:33,255
Glory be.

776
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:37,282
Now, my son, let's go about God's work this night.

777
01:16:49,546 --> 01:16:51,844
Pluskat.

778
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,117
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

779
01:17:00,826 --> 01:17:02,350
Nothing that I've heard....

780
01:17:04,629 --> 01:17:08,326
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

781
01:17:10,503 --> 01:17:12,767
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

782
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,739
Well, wait a minute.

783
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,875
Yes, just a moment.

784
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:35,983
Flares, but a long way up the coast.

785
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:39,558
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

786
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:42,631
There's probably nothing to it...

787
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,900
...but we have had reports of paratrooper landings.

788
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:51,171
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

789
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:53,614
Thank you, sir.

790
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:14,169
Higher! Higher!

791
01:18:18,513 --> 01:18:22,335
Louis, open your store. We need more buckets!

792
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:30,252
Mayor Renaud, you must come with me immediately.

793
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,850
-Is it important?
-Very important, Mayor Renaud.

794
01:18:43,942 --> 01:18:45,466
What's wrong, madam?

795
01:18:45,643 --> 01:18:47,235
I was on my way to the little house outside....

796
01:18:47,545 --> 01:18:48,910
Yes, yes, go on.

797
01:18:49,181 --> 01:18:52,036
Suddenly, I saw a man fall from the sky.

798
01:18:52,318 --> 01:18:54,183
-A parachutist?
-Yes, that's right.

799
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:56,011
He looked like a big white bird!

800
01:18:56,256 --> 01:18:58,349
-British or German?
-What?

801
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,957
The parachutist, was he a friend or an enemy?

802
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:04,823
I don't know. He disappeared without a word. Just "Shh!"

803
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:07,361
-Without a word?
-Just "Shh!"

804
01:19:15,544 --> 01:19:17,239
Bonjour, madame...

805
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:19,534
...je suis americain.

806
01:19:20,116 --> 01:19:22,072
Bonjour, mademoiselle...

807
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:24,084
...je suis americain.

808
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,321
We seem to be circling.

809
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:32,324
Maybe they're having difficulty finding the drop zone.

810
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:34,828
Je suis...

811
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:36,431
...amercan.

812
01:19:36,668 --> 01:19:39,228
Je suis amricain.

813
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:41,862
Voulez-vous...

814
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,167
...mademoiselle?

815
01:19:45,011 --> 01:19:47,036
Okay.

816
01:19:47,213 --> 01:19:48,544
Go!

817
01:19:49,316 --> 01:19:50,578
Go!

818
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:54,982
Go! Go! Go!

819
01:20:23,621 --> 01:20:25,316
Paratroopers!

820
01:20:29,795 --> 01:20:34,391
Paratroop groups.Those are paratroop groups!

821
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,311
Anything new?

822
01:23:48,586 --> 01:23:52,545
Heavy bombing over Cherbourg as usual, sir...

823
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,220
...and now near Caen.

824
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:58,157
The lines to Stations 6 and 8 have been cut...

825
01:23:58,363 --> 01:24:00,490
...but the direct line is open.

826
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,685
I'll stay for a while.

827
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:25,452
-Would you like coffee?
-Yes, thank you.

828
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:09,702
For God's sakes, padre, stop that damn noise.

829
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:12,539
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

830
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:14,408
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

831
01:26:08,944 --> 01:26:09,968
Two clicks.

832
01:26:10,279 --> 01:26:12,372
I heard two clicks.

833
01:27:53,562 --> 01:27:54,722
Man...

834
01:27:54,931 --> 01:27:56,853
...am I glad to see you.

835
01:27:57,633 --> 01:28:00,659
-You guys the 82nd?
-No. This is the 101.

836
01:28:00,903 --> 01:28:02,234
101?

837
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:03,736
Where's the 82nd?

838
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:07,274
Look, bud, we don't even know where our own outfit is.

839
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:10,970
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

840
01:28:11,216 --> 01:28:12,706
Let's us go find this war.

841
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:14,248
Come on.

842
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,318
Maybe they're Limeys and ain't got no cricket.

843
01:28:50,059 --> 01:28:52,015
They must be our guys.

844
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,066
Okay.

845
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:20,785
No.

846
01:29:36,345 --> 01:29:37,607
Hey.

847
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,341
Hey, they were Germans.

848
01:29:50,895 --> 01:29:54,991
Hundreds of planes have been flying to my left and right.

849
01:29:55,233 --> 01:29:56,860
Toward Caen.

850
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,424
Yes.

851
01:29:59,872 --> 01:30:05,071
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula. Something must be happening!

852
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:10,510
But what, Pluskat, what? I haven't the faintest idea.

853
01:30:12,385 --> 01:30:16,082
Has anything been observed on the beaches?

854
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:20,422
No, nothing.

855
01:30:21,429 --> 01:30:23,761
Yes, I'll let you know right away.

856
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:25,362
Of course.

857
01:30:32,942 --> 01:30:35,399
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

858
01:30:35,612 --> 01:30:37,307
Compound fracture, sir.

859
01:30:37,581 --> 01:30:41,677
Well, put the boot back on and lace it up, tight.

860
01:30:41,919 --> 01:30:43,648
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

861
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,652
And you're not walking on it.

862
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:50,180
-You're not going to try--
-Knock it off and do as you're told.

863
01:31:01,474 --> 01:31:02,463
Yes?

864
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:05,906
A, B and C Company are scattered all over like we are.

865
01:31:06,146 --> 01:31:07,477
Go on.

866
01:31:07,682 --> 01:31:11,812
Major Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke his shoulder.
I left him with a medic.

867
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:13,643
Any contact with F Company?

868
01:31:13,854 --> 01:31:17,881
No, but they must be up ahead
in the direction of Sainte-Mere-Eglise.

869
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:22,453
Well, go ahead. Tie it off. Tie it off.

870
01:31:26,803 --> 01:31:28,430
Well, here's where we are.

871
01:31:28,638 --> 01:31:30,560
The northern edge of the swamp area...

872
01:31:30,774 --> 01:31:32,639
...five miles from our drop zone.

873
01:31:32,843 --> 01:31:34,674
Five miles.

874
01:31:35,512 --> 01:31:36,570
-F Company?
-No, sir.

875
01:31:36,814 --> 01:31:38,941
And we've got scouts all over the place.

876
01:31:39,184 --> 01:31:41,175
We even picked up a group from the 101.

877
01:31:41,419 --> 01:31:45,344
F Company were the first of the lead planes.

878
01:31:46,425 --> 01:31:48,222
Well, give me a hand.

879
01:31:57,704 --> 01:31:59,433
Can I have my rifle?

880
01:32:09,685 --> 01:32:11,846
Well, we'll head out this way.

881
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:16,917
We ought to reach high ground  and open country by daybreak.

882
01:32:17,427 --> 01:32:19,691
All right. Have the men spread out...

883
01:32:19,896 --> 01:32:21,852
...pick up any stragglers they can find.

884
01:32:22,065 --> 01:32:23,464
-Pass the word.
-Right, sir.

885
01:32:23,701 --> 01:32:26,659
All right, men, spread out. Pick up stragglers you see.

886
01:32:26,871 --> 01:32:28,532
Pass the word down.

887
01:32:30,241 --> 01:32:31,606
All right...

888
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:33,172
...Iet's go.

889
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,407
From the latest reports, this is how I see it:

890
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:41,711
American paratroopers have landed....

891
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:44,846
...here.

892
01:32:45,558 --> 01:32:47,856
British paratroopers here.

893
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,091
The invasion....

894
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:54,223
...here.

895
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,466
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.

896
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:05,006
General Pemsel is convinced that this is the invasion.

897
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:10,105
I do not agree with him. This is my conclusion:

898
01:33:10,387 --> 01:33:13,743
Normandy is the objective of a diversionary attack.

899
01:33:13,957 --> 01:33:16,255
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

900
01:33:16,593 --> 01:33:20,484
It's not the main attack.
That will come at the Pas-de-Calais...

901
01:33:21,332 --> 01:33:23,129
...where it was always expected.

902
01:33:26,772 --> 01:33:28,603
Where we always expected it.

903
01:33:29,341 --> 01:33:31,832
But we can't take any chances.

904
01:33:32,111 --> 01:33:35,274
I want the reserve panzers moved up at once!

905
01:33:35,615 --> 01:33:38,448
We need approval from the Fuhrer's headquarters.

906
01:33:38,651 --> 01:33:41,449
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

907
01:33:41,755 --> 01:33:46,783
Call the Fuhrer's headquarters and insist.

908
01:33:46,994 --> 01:33:51,488
Insist that the panzers be released to me immediately!

909
01:33:56,372 --> 01:34:02,060
An invasion of Normandy would be against all military logic.

910
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,203
It would really be against all logic.

911
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,038
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.

912
01:34:23,184 --> 01:34:25,675
Most of you have had your feet wet before:

913
01:34:26,221 --> 01:34:28,781
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.

914
01:34:29,025 --> 01:34:31,880
And we know what it means to be driven into the sea.

915
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:35,057
In a few hours we're going back from the sea.

916
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:38,895
And this time we're going to stay.

917
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:42,364
There's no time for any sob stuff about...

918
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:44,874
...England, home and beauty.

919
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:50,214
Remember, our people have had a rough time
for four and a half years.

920
01:34:51,553 --> 01:34:53,714
They've earned the final victory.

921
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,552
Let's give it to them.

922
01:34:58,862 --> 01:35:01,820
And to our French comrades in arms, I say:

923
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,624
Good luck.

924
01:35:03,903 --> 01:35:05,859
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.

925
01:35:15,317 --> 01:35:17,808
Come in, Teddy. That will be all, sergeant.

926
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,931
Did you have to put it in writing?

927
01:35:29,269 --> 01:35:31,635
I knew you wouldn't let me go unless I did.

928
01:35:31,839 --> 01:35:33,864
You're putting me on the spot.

929
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:36,669
-I didn't mean to, Tubby.
-The hell you didn't.

930
01:35:36,945 --> 01:35:39,709
You put that request in writing, made it official.

931
01:35:39,949 --> 01:35:42,509
You're the assistant division commander.

932
01:35:42,786 --> 01:35:46,017
And that's why I'm supposed to go ashore in the first wave.

933
01:35:46,291 --> 01:35:49,021
That's where I'm supposed to be.  You know that.

934
01:35:49,295 --> 01:35:50,922
You're important to this operation.

935
01:35:51,131 --> 01:35:53,793
We can't have you knocked off on the first day.

936
01:35:53,967 --> 01:35:56,299
But that's not the real reason.

937
01:35:56,504 --> 01:36:00,134
Isn't it because my father was president of the United States?

938
01:36:00,409 --> 01:36:01,808
And a great president.

939
01:36:02,045 --> 01:36:03,808
And a great soldier.

940
01:36:04,047 --> 01:36:07,312
He led the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill.

941
01:36:08,353 --> 01:36:11,949
So now you've got to be the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

942
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:15,890
But that's where I'm supposed to be, Tubby. That's my job.

943
01:36:22,003 --> 01:36:26,031
Also, I've been there side by side
with the men all through training.

944
01:36:26,209 --> 01:36:30,340
They're used to seeing me there.
They have a right to expect me there.

945
01:36:30,981 --> 01:36:33,176
President's son or not.

946
01:36:35,887 --> 01:36:37,684
Is my request denied?

947
01:36:50,107 --> 01:36:51,995
No, you know it's not.

948
01:36:53,745 --> 01:36:57,044
Request reluctantly approved.

949
01:36:59,084 --> 01:37:00,608
Thanks, Tubby.

950
01:37:02,389 --> 01:37:03,617
Thanks a lot.

951
01:37:05,126 --> 01:37:06,218
Say...

952
01:37:06,427 --> 01:37:08,520
...how's that arthritis of yours?

953
01:37:09,097 --> 01:37:10,724
Arthritis?

954
01:37:11,434 --> 01:37:13,891
Haven't had a touch in months.

955
01:37:14,138 --> 01:37:15,469
Glad to hear it.

956
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,624
The street...

957
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:38,230
...the bridge...

958
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:40,536
...the hotel...

959
01:37:42,474 --> 01:37:43,930
...the casino.

960
01:37:46,946 --> 01:37:48,743
That's it, gentlemen.

961
01:37:58,461 --> 01:37:59,792
One more thing....

962
01:38:01,665 --> 01:38:04,657
You have been fighting everywhere for four years...

963
01:38:04,969 --> 01:38:10,203
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete....

964
01:38:12,278 --> 01:38:15,338
But this time you are going to fight on French soil...

965
01:38:15,983 --> 01:38:17,507
...in our fields...

966
01:38:18,653 --> 01:38:20,109
...in our villages...

967
01:38:22,225 --> 01:38:24,056
...under the eyes of our own people.

968
01:38:27,565 --> 01:38:31,161
I can't wake the Fuhrer
on the strength of contradictory reports.

969
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:35,094
He was up till four. He took a sedative and then retired.

970
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:38,103
I won't wake him for these reports.

971
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:43,173
First we hear that the paratroopers are shot down plane crews.

972
01:38:43,385 --> 01:38:46,513
Next they are identified as mechanical dummies.

973
01:38:46,723 --> 01:38:50,649
If these reports are true and paratroopers have landed...

974
01:38:50,861 --> 01:38:54,525
...it can only be a commando raid.

975
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:59,364
Is that a sufficient reason to send the panzers to the coast?

976
01:38:59,706 --> 01:39:04,804
I will submit all reports to the Fuhrer as soon as he awakens.

977
01:39:05,814 --> 01:39:07,577
I understand.

978
01:39:09,586 --> 01:39:11,417
Jodl has turned us down.

979
01:39:14,058 --> 01:39:18,689
He will not release the panzers
without the Fuhrer's approval...

980
01:39:21,234 --> 01:39:24,226
...and the Fuhrer is still asleep!

981
01:39:25,774 --> 01:39:27,935
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

982
01:39:31,347 --> 01:39:32,939
No, not now....

983
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:37,116
Not now.

984
01:39:38,623 --> 01:39:40,352
Thank you, gentlemen.

985
01:39:56,813 --> 01:39:59,236
Sit down.

986
01:40:01,252 --> 01:40:03,482
This is history.

987
01:40:05,324 --> 01:40:08,988
We are living a historical moment.

988
01:40:10,497 --> 01:40:11,987
We are going to lose the war...

989
01:40:12,166 --> 01:40:17,025
...because the glorious Fuhrer has taken a sleeping pill...

990
01:40:18,675 --> 01:40:21,098
...and is not to be awakened.

991
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:24,272
It's unbelievable.

992
01:40:24,482 --> 01:40:26,109
Think of it, Kurt.

993
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:29,980
Don't ever forget it.

994
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,148
We are witnessing something...

995
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:38,525
...which historians will always say is completely improbable...

996
01:40:38,734 --> 01:40:40,429
...and yet it is true.

997
01:40:44,007 --> 01:40:46,999
The Fuhrer is not to be awakened!

998
01:40:48,012 --> 01:40:51,436
I sometimes wonder whose side God is on.

999
01:40:53,453 --> 01:40:54,408
Can l...

1000
01:40:55,723 --> 01:40:57,782
...bring you anything, sir?

1001
01:41:01,663 --> 01:41:05,225
In my room there is a bottle of excellent cognac...

1002
01:41:05,468 --> 01:41:08,096
...Napoleon, unopened.

1003
01:41:08,972 --> 01:41:12,100
I was even saving it for a fitting occasion.

1004
01:41:13,112 --> 01:41:17,937
This isn't exactly the right occasion, but get it anyway.

1005
01:41:43,584 --> 01:41:45,176
Daylight at last.

1006
01:41:47,723 --> 01:41:50,578
A whole night wasted again!

1007
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,464
Where's my dog?

1008
01:41:59,671 --> 01:42:01,764
He was here a minute ago.

1009
01:42:07,615 --> 01:42:09,310
Let's have one last look.

1010
01:42:12,989 --> 01:42:14,752
Nothing.

1011
01:42:15,425 --> 01:42:17,120
Not even a seagull....

1012
01:42:26,873 --> 01:42:28,170
My God!

1013
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:36,250
The invasion.

1014
01:42:37,754 --> 01:42:39,153
They're coming!

1015
01:42:39,657 --> 01:42:41,613
Everyone to your posts!

1016
01:42:43,261 --> 01:42:48,052
It's the invasion!  There must be 5000 ships out there!

1017
01:42:48,668 --> 01:42:51,159
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.

1018
01:42:52,973 --> 01:42:56,363
The enemy doesn't have even half that many.

1019
01:42:56,744 --> 01:43:00,772
Well, damn it!  Come and see for yourself, you fool!

1020
01:43:01,785 --> 01:43:03,412
It's amazing.

1021
01:43:03,687 --> 01:43:06,076
It's beyond belief.

1022
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:11,057
My dear Pluskat, where are these ships heading?

1023
01:43:11,264 --> 01:43:12,925
Straight for me!

1024
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,616
General, in exactly two minutes...

1025
01:43:31,824 --> 01:43:34,019
...the fleet will open fire.

1026
01:43:34,827 --> 01:43:38,594
Your attention, please.
The admiral has an announcement.

1027
01:43:41,869 --> 01:43:45,829
Soon we will have the honor to be engaged in battle.

1028
01:43:46,943 --> 01:43:51,870
To drive the enemy out, we must fire on our homeland.

1029
01:43:52,751 --> 01:43:54,946
This is the price of liberty.

1030
01:43:56,055 --> 01:43:57,386
Long live France!

1031
01:44:26,293 --> 01:44:29,821
There he goes, right on time, as usual.

1032
01:45:20,597 --> 01:45:24,830
They're landing! They're coming! They're coming!

1033
01:45:33,414 --> 01:45:35,575
I'm not crazy. Look, they're landing!

1034
01:45:35,883 --> 01:45:38,147
The Americans, the English and the French!

1035
01:46:13,998 --> 01:46:18,493
Do you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's going on?

1036
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:21,499
You must be deaf! Can't you...?

1037
01:46:22,643 --> 01:46:26,205
Damn it, can't you hear it for yourself?

1038
01:46:29,652 --> 01:46:33,817
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!

1039
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:43,863
Those 5000 ships you say the Allies haven't got...

1040
01:46:44,204 --> 01:46:47,196
...well, they've got them!

1041
01:46:58,723 --> 01:47:00,452
It's wonderful!

1042
01:47:19,917 --> 01:47:21,908
Yes? What is it now?

1043
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:23,710
Listen to me, Pips.

1044
01:47:23,856 --> 01:47:28,248
The invasion has started!  Put yourself on alert at once!

1045
01:47:28,528 --> 01:47:32,260
What the hell can I do with only two planes?

1046
01:47:32,633 --> 01:47:35,022
Where are the others, you idiots?!

1047
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:39,899
Priller, that's an order!  Get ready at once! Understand?

1048
01:47:40,143 --> 01:47:43,067
If it isn't too much trouble...

1049
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,613
...would you tell me where the invasion is?

1050
01:47:48,888 --> 01:47:51,777
What? Normandy! How delightful!

1051
01:47:51,992 --> 01:47:56,350
Thanks, my faithful Hans. That's the end for us! So long!

1052
01:47:57,065 --> 01:48:00,627
It's getting very difficult  to get any sleep around here.

1053
01:48:03,406 --> 01:48:08,640
Your prospects for a long sleep are excellent.
The invasion has begun.

1054
01:48:08,914 --> 01:48:13,079
Normandy. We're flying there, the two of us.

1055
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:15,982
Nobody else is left.

1056
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:19,823
I don't think we're coming back.

1057
01:49:16,767 --> 01:49:21,728
Move out! Move out!

1058
01:49:32,054 --> 01:49:33,783
The shelling has stopped.

1059
01:49:37,427 --> 01:49:38,724
Landing craft approaching.

1060
01:49:38,963 --> 01:49:43,321
Return to headquarters. Direct your troops from there!

1061
01:49:43,769 --> 01:49:45,930
Landing craft approaching the coast!

1062
01:49:51,212 --> 01:49:53,476
Those French bastards!

1063
01:49:53,715 --> 01:49:55,603
Sergeant!

1064
01:49:55,851 --> 01:49:59,150
Send this to headquarters by courier.

1065
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:05,024
No! Take it yourself. Tell them our lines are cut!

1066
01:50:05,263 --> 01:50:07,219
Gentlemen, come here please.

1067
01:50:08,734 --> 01:50:10,929
Attack!

1068
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:12,667
Fast!

1069
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:16,707
Take your positions!

1070
01:50:19,348 --> 01:50:21,373
Take your positions!

1071
01:50:24,154 --> 01:50:26,645
Don't let them get too close!

1072
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,321
Fast!

1073
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:32,326
Attack!

1074
01:50:47,851 --> 01:50:51,640
There it is, men.  Omaha Beach, dead ahead.

1075
01:50:52,558 --> 01:50:53,820
Lock on the target!

1076
01:50:56,796 --> 01:50:58,457
Stand by!

1077
01:52:03,482 --> 01:52:05,746
Get off of the beach!

1078
01:52:05,985 --> 01:52:07,782
Let's go!

1079
01:52:52,578 --> 01:52:53,738
Come on, move up!

1080
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
Hello, general, sir.

1081
01:53:13,973 --> 01:53:16,999
-Are you all right, boy?
-Yes, sir.

1082
01:53:17,244 --> 01:53:20,338
Don't you think you better go back and get your rifle?

1083
01:53:20,548 --> 01:53:21,913
Out there, sir?

1084
01:53:22,117 --> 01:53:25,041
You're almost sure to need it before this day is over.

1085
01:53:26,489 --> 01:53:28,480
Yes, sir.

1086
01:53:43,244 --> 01:53:46,077
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.

1087
01:53:53,524 --> 01:53:55,788
Medic! Medic!

1088
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:19,509
General, first reports from Omaha, sir.

1089
01:54:19,725 --> 01:54:21,056
"Assault teams have landed.

1090
01:54:21,293 --> 01:54:24,126
No direct radio contact, but destroyers report...

1091
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:27,424
...first and second waves appear pinned down on the beach.

1092
01:54:27,668 --> 01:54:30,592
Concentrated artillery and mortar fire.

1093
01:54:30,805 --> 01:54:34,572
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties, sir.

1094
01:55:33,419 --> 01:55:35,751
When the mortars and machine guns are silenced...

1095
01:55:35,956 --> 01:55:39,654
...have the battalion commanders join me over there.

1096
01:55:39,894 --> 01:55:41,054
Okay.

1097
01:55:41,262 --> 01:55:43,651
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.

1098
01:56:13,771 --> 01:56:15,102
I made it.

1099
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:18,938
Hey, I made it.

1100
01:56:19,278 --> 01:56:21,200
Did you see me get those two guys?

1101
01:56:22,916 --> 01:56:24,349
Hey, sergeant?

1102
01:56:28,423 --> 01:56:29,788
Sergeant?

1103
01:56:31,961 --> 01:56:35,693
As best as I can figure it, this is the wrong beach.

1104
01:56:35,933 --> 01:56:39,631
We're a mile and a quarter
south of where we were supposed to land.

1105
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:41,600
We should be up there.

1106
01:56:41,774 --> 01:56:44,971
Control boat must've been confused
by the naval bombardment smoke.

1107
01:56:45,345 --> 01:56:47,336
I agree with you, but what will we do now?

1108
01:56:47,514 --> 01:56:51,110
Reinforcements and heavy equipment
will approach in a very few minutes.

1109
01:56:51,286 --> 01:56:54,380
-I know, I know.
-What if they land at the right beach?

1110
01:57:03,802 --> 01:57:07,158
The reinforcements will have to follow us wherever we are.

1111
01:57:08,908 --> 01:57:10,796
We're starting the war from right here.

1112
01:57:11,912 --> 01:57:14,938
-Head inland. We're going inland.
-Okay, let's go.

1113
01:57:32,973 --> 01:57:35,498
Follow me. Do everything I do!

1114
01:57:39,214 --> 01:57:41,637
All right. Let's go!

1115
01:58:27,743 --> 01:58:30,075
Head for home!

1116
01:58:31,648 --> 01:58:35,004
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!

1117
01:58:45,232 --> 01:58:46,597
Stand by to beach.

1118
01:58:46,802 --> 01:58:48,861
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.

1119
01:58:49,572 --> 01:58:52,427
Any minute now. Stand by!

1120
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:54,869
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!

1121
01:58:55,412 --> 01:58:58,108
You hear that? Dunkirk. Do you hear it, Clough?

1122
01:58:58,316 --> 01:59:00,341
Sure he was at school at the time.

1123
01:59:02,822 --> 01:59:04,915
Come on, you bums!

1124
01:59:05,692 --> 01:59:09,652
Come out, you dirty slobs! Flanagan's back!

1125
01:59:12,835 --> 01:59:15,759
The evil of it all. Drowning a man before he fights.

1126
01:59:15,939 --> 01:59:17,270
Oh, come on!

1127
01:59:52,953 --> 01:59:55,444
Keep those vehicles moving!

1128
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:59,252
MP, chase out those cyclists.

1129
01:59:59,495 --> 02:00:01,087
Get off the beach!

1130
02:00:01,697 --> 02:00:03,824
Move inland!

1131
02:00:06,171 --> 02:00:07,433
Come on, you lot!

1132
02:00:07,672 --> 02:00:09,105
Hurry it up.

1133
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:14,271
Never mind the blathering!

1134
02:00:14,514 --> 02:00:16,436
We must put these down somewhere.

1135
02:00:16,684 --> 02:00:18,515
The sooner you get off the beach...

1136
02:00:18,686 --> 02:00:21,519
...the sooner they'll stop this blasted shelling.

1137
02:00:21,723 --> 02:00:23,748
It's very bad for the dog!

1138
02:00:26,430 --> 02:00:28,261
Down, Winston, down!

1139
02:00:29,333 --> 02:00:31,927
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.

1140
02:00:32,204 --> 02:00:35,469
Third wave ashore on time. No obstruction to follow-up.

1141
02:00:35,708 --> 02:00:37,266
Standing by.

1142
02:00:38,712 --> 02:00:40,236
Get going!

1143
02:00:40,715 --> 02:00:43,275
For heaven's sake, get that carrier off the beach!

1144
02:00:43,484 --> 02:00:46,647
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your radio.

1145
02:00:46,855 --> 02:00:49,312
If you can't drive it, carry it!

1146
02:00:50,227 --> 02:00:51,353
You were saying?

1147
02:00:51,529 --> 02:00:54,157
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your--

1148
02:00:54,333 --> 02:00:57,632
My dear fellow, I don't want to appear uncooperative--

1149
02:00:57,904 --> 02:01:00,464
Yes, I know all about the power of the press.

1150
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:04,302
But this line happens to be rather busy! Come on!

1151
02:01:08,451 --> 02:01:10,180
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.

1152
02:01:13,257 --> 02:01:14,349
What did he say?

1153
02:01:14,625 --> 02:01:16,286
The answer is no.

1154
02:01:16,527 --> 02:01:18,324
We have to use the damn pigeons.

1155
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:20,225
I've got these ready.

1156
02:01:20,799 --> 02:01:22,391
Here, clip this on.

1157
02:01:37,121 --> 02:01:38,611
They're going the wrong way.

1158
02:01:38,856 --> 02:01:40,812
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!

1159
02:01:41,059 --> 02:01:44,187
The other way! The other way!

1160
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:46,126
Damned traitors!

1161
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:49,028
-Hold it.
-Can't you get your finger out?

1162
02:01:49,303 --> 02:01:51,931
-What's the matter?
-Engine won't start, sir.

1163
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,767
Full of seawater, I think.

1164
02:01:55,311 --> 02:01:56,835
My old grandmother used to say...

1165
02:01:57,047 --> 02:01:59,743
...anything mechanical, give it a good bash.

1166
02:02:00,318 --> 02:02:02,548
Try it now.

1167
02:02:04,823 --> 02:02:05,755
Thank you, sir.

1168
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:07,481
Off you go. Good luck.

1169
02:02:12,433 --> 02:02:13,798
I'm sure that got it out.

1170
02:02:15,837 --> 02:02:17,930
That's what I call a hell of a man!

1171
02:02:18,174 --> 02:02:20,369
Aye, I like his dog too.

1172
02:02:21,411 --> 02:02:23,208
Don't stand there yapping!

1173
02:02:23,413 --> 02:02:26,177
This isn't Hyde Park Corner! The war's over there!

1174
02:02:28,854 --> 02:02:29,786
Come along!

1175
02:02:29,988 --> 02:02:31,250
Come on!

1176
02:02:32,192 --> 02:02:35,025
-Thank you.
-Everything's going according to plan.

1177
02:02:35,229 --> 02:02:38,528
Stand by to move. Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

1178
02:02:49,748 --> 02:02:51,943
What in God's name...?

1179
02:02:56,123 --> 02:02:59,912
Oh, my friends. What a day! What a day!

1180
02:03:00,228 --> 02:03:02,492
Welcome to France. Welcome to Colleville!

1181
02:03:02,731 --> 02:03:04,858
Most kind of you. Very nice to meet you--

1182
02:03:05,134 --> 02:03:07,261
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

1183
02:03:07,437 --> 02:03:10,270
But I don't think there will be enough for everyone.

1184
02:03:10,474 --> 02:03:14,571
Perhaps next time. We have a previous engagement: the war!

1185
02:03:15,614 --> 02:03:17,241
Mustn't lose that champagne!

1186
02:03:17,617 --> 02:03:20,609
All right, men, fall in! Millin, "Blue Bonnet."

1187
02:03:22,289 --> 02:03:23,620
Goodbye.

1188
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:28,115
Thank you, boys! Thank you!

1189
02:03:33,871 --> 02:03:36,635
Long live France! Long live the Allies!

1190
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:39,140
If you ask me, Flanagan...

1191
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:42,769
...there's a lot of very peculiar blokes on this beach.

1192
02:03:44,151 --> 02:03:45,675
Welcome!

1193
02:03:46,654 --> 02:03:48,281
Welcome to you all!

1194
02:05:39,967 --> 02:05:43,198
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!

1195
02:05:45,307 --> 02:05:47,969
Better try them on first.

1196
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,906
Rommel speaking.

1197
02:05:54,118 --> 02:05:55,551
Good morning.

1198
02:05:56,488 --> 02:05:57,853
What?

1199
02:05:58,490 --> 02:05:59,855
What!

1200
02:06:00,627 --> 02:06:01,924
Where?

1201
02:06:02,396 --> 02:06:03,420
Normandy!

1202
02:06:04,498 --> 02:06:06,693
Have they a foothold already?

1203
02:06:07,202 --> 02:06:09,864
They must be thrown back!

1204
02:06:10,473 --> 02:06:12,566
What about the panzer reserves?

1205
02:06:13,677 --> 02:06:17,033
Did von Rundstedt obtain their release from the Fuhrer?

1206
02:06:28,496 --> 02:06:33,093
Normandy, Normandy.

1207
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:35,762
How stupid of me!

1208
02:06:36,472 --> 02:06:37,928
Stupid.

1209
02:06:51,893 --> 02:06:53,292
There it is.

1210
02:07:04,642 --> 02:07:07,304
You mean to tell me that's all we gotta climb?

1211
02:07:07,546 --> 02:07:09,776
They're not as high as the practice ones.

1212
02:07:10,049 --> 02:07:11,778
They wasn't shooting at us then.

1213
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:15,809
Why can't the Air Force or Navy do this job?

1214
02:07:16,057 --> 02:07:19,824
The big guns in bunkers behind the cliff
can't be seen from the air.

1215
02:07:20,062 --> 02:07:23,293
We knock them out or they'll murder our guys on the beach.

1216
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,263
Yeah, well, if you ask me...

1217
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:28,428
...three grandmothers with brooms could sweep us off there...

1218
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:30,595
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

1219
02:14:06,085 --> 02:14:07,950
That's it, the one we're after.

1220
02:15:04,994 --> 02:15:06,291
It's empty.

1221
02:15:06,763 --> 02:15:10,187
The Air Force and Navy really plastered this baby.

1222
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:11,798
But I don't get--

1223
02:15:12,737 --> 02:15:14,102
The guns.

1224
02:15:14,807 --> 02:15:16,399
There ain't no mounts.

1225
02:15:17,243 --> 02:15:19,404
They've never even been installed.

1226
02:15:20,748 --> 02:15:21,942
You mean...

1227
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:25,774
...we come up all this way...

1228
02:15:26,021 --> 02:15:27,579
...for nothing?

1229
02:15:32,696 --> 02:15:34,789
Don't worry, sarge, you'll be all right.

1230
02:15:35,066 --> 02:15:37,330
Medic! Medic!

1231
02:15:38,812 --> 02:15:40,435
"Bitte!", "Bitte!"

1232
02:15:46,314 --> 02:15:48,737
I wonder what "Bitte, Bitte" means.

1233
02:15:59,197 --> 02:16:02,929
What the hell are you wearing a life preserver for?

1234
02:16:03,569 --> 02:16:05,298
I can't swim.

1235
02:16:13,449 --> 02:16:17,978
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

1236
02:16:18,789 --> 02:16:22,749
This is madness, madness, sheer madness!

1237
02:16:24,263 --> 02:16:25,992
What is it?

1238
02:16:26,266 --> 02:16:30,499
I just talked to General Jodl, the Fuhrer is awake.

1239
02:16:30,738 --> 02:16:36,302
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?

1240
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:41,641
The Fuhrer went into one of his tantrums...

1241
02:16:42,286 --> 02:16:45,050
...and no one dared bring up the subject.

1242
02:16:45,623 --> 02:16:47,784
They're still held in reserve!

1243
02:16:48,394 --> 02:16:50,521
Yes, field marshal.

1244
02:16:53,134 --> 02:16:56,523
Sir, if you would call the Fuhrer yourself...

1245
02:16:56,939 --> 02:17:00,295
...I am convinced he would respect your views.

1246
02:17:00,643 --> 02:17:02,076
Call him?

1247
02:17:02,312 --> 02:17:05,167
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

1248
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:09,483
Crawl on my knees to him?!

1249
02:17:10,155 --> 02:17:12,783
No! It is out of the question!

1250
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:21,928
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."

1251
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:23,429
What's that?

1252
02:17:23,706 --> 02:17:26,971
Nothing, nothing of importance.

1253
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,575
Here, let me help you.

1254
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:34,913
You all right, Tom?  Come on, they're up there.

1255
02:17:39,226 --> 02:17:41,114
-Sir.
-Well?

1256
02:17:41,428 --> 02:17:44,761
Mr. Smith says to tell you he's stood his men too.

1257
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,127
The Jerries are moving up into the woods...

1258
02:17:47,436 --> 02:17:49,358
...with machine guns and mortars.

1259
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,266
-Tell the men to stand firm!
-Tell the chaps--

1260
02:17:53,478 --> 02:17:56,572
Tell them to expect another counterattack, a heavy one.

1261
02:18:00,987 --> 02:18:03,012
-Here you are, mate.
-Ta.

1262
02:18:06,995 --> 02:18:08,724
-What's the matter?
-Listen.

1263
02:18:08,897 --> 02:18:10,785
I thought I heard bagpipes.

1264
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,865
Don't be daft!

1265
02:18:21,747 --> 02:18:24,739
I told you I heard bagpipes! It's the reinforcements.

1266
02:18:38,903 --> 02:18:39,961
It's Lovat!

1267
02:18:47,948 --> 02:18:49,279
Come on!

1268
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:51,306
Come on!

1269
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,447
-Sorry I'm late.
-Better than never, sir.

1270
02:19:20,657 --> 02:19:22,056
Glad to see you, Shimmy.

1271
02:19:26,831 --> 02:19:29,994
You boys are right on target. What's the situation?

1272
02:19:30,202 --> 02:19:33,126
Jerry's regrouping in the woods, about a mile.

1273
02:19:33,507 --> 02:19:35,270
With mortars and heavy machine guns.

1274
02:19:35,509 --> 02:19:36,567
Numbers?

1275
02:19:36,844 --> 02:19:40,508
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem to be moving forward in force.

1276
02:19:42,384 --> 02:19:44,011
In that case, we won't wait.

1277
02:19:44,854 --> 02:19:46,219
We'd better get moving.

1278
02:19:46,857 --> 02:19:48,745
All right, we're going across.

1279
02:19:48,993 --> 02:19:50,187
-Millin!
-Sir?

1280
02:19:51,029 --> 02:19:52,621
"Black Bear," sir.

1281
02:19:53,098 --> 02:19:55,362
All right, come on.

1282
02:19:55,568 --> 02:19:57,024
Everybody up!

1283
02:19:57,571 --> 02:19:59,027
On your feet!

1284
02:20:05,414 --> 02:20:08,542
There he goes. He's at it again.

1285
02:20:08,919 --> 02:20:11,649
Ever hear such a bleeding racket in all your life?

1286
02:20:11,889 --> 02:20:14,619
Yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes.

1287
02:20:30,213 --> 02:20:32,340
Hold until relieved.

1288
02:20:32,616 --> 02:20:34,311
Hold until relieved.

1289
02:20:36,788 --> 02:20:41,613
North by east, north by east. Sainte-Mere-Eglise is that way.

1290
02:20:42,095 --> 02:20:43,983
Somebody turned that sign around.

1291
02:20:44,197 --> 02:20:47,895
Doesn't anybody in this outfit look at a compass besides me?

1292
02:20:48,336 --> 02:20:49,667
Hey, you guys!

1293
02:20:49,905 --> 02:20:53,603
Over here! Over here!

1294
02:20:54,711 --> 02:20:56,770
Over here, on the double.

1295
02:20:59,451 --> 02:21:01,783
-Where you taking that?
-We don't know, sir.

1296
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:03,849
We took the wrong road.

1297
02:21:04,757 --> 02:21:06,486
What do you got in here, ammo?

1298
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,057
Yes, sir.

1299
02:21:08,428 --> 02:21:11,158
-You 82nd?
-No, sir, 101.

1300
02:21:11,366 --> 02:21:14,028
Well, you're in the 82nd now.

1301
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:17,264
-But, sir, we're--
-But what?

1302
02:21:17,507 --> 02:21:18,872
Nothing, sir.

1303
02:21:19,776 --> 02:21:21,641
All right, move out.

1304
02:21:25,284 --> 02:21:27,548
-Knock that sign down!
-Yes, sir.

1305
02:21:33,861 --> 02:21:37,684
-Something's moving up there, colonel.
-Hit the dirt! Take cover.

1306
02:21:40,938 --> 02:21:42,894
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.

1307
02:21:45,243 --> 02:21:47,541
Colonel, it's me!

1308
02:21:49,982 --> 02:21:52,405
-Where did you come from?
-Sainte-Mere-Eglise.

1309
02:21:52,686 --> 02:21:55,382
We hold the main road and north side of the square.

1310
02:21:55,690 --> 02:21:58,750
The Germans have a battery on the other side of the town...

1311
02:21:58,927 --> 02:22:01,452
-...and command the countryside.
-And Major Lance?

1312
02:22:01,697 --> 02:22:05,395
-Holed up in a building in the square.
-F Company?

1313
02:22:06,203 --> 02:22:09,765
They overshot the drop zone
and landed in the middle of the town.

1314
02:22:10,008 --> 02:22:11,032
Go on.

1315
02:22:11,309 --> 02:22:14,142
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.

1316
02:22:14,413 --> 02:22:16,973
They were mowed down before they hit the ground.

1317
02:22:21,356 --> 02:22:24,018
Major Lance sent me to try and contact you, sir.

1318
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:27,822
He wants your permission
to pull back and regroup outside of town.

1319
02:22:30,735 --> 02:22:35,435
No, damn it. We came here to take Sainte-Mere-Eglise.

1320
02:22:35,607 --> 02:22:37,495
We're gonna take it and hold it.

1321
02:22:38,845 --> 02:22:41,302
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.

1322
02:22:52,329 --> 02:22:54,695
-Sir.
-Thank you.

1323
02:22:56,034 --> 02:22:59,892
British and Canadians advancing steadily
from Sword, Gold, and Juno.

1324
02:23:03,276 --> 02:23:05,141
Anything from Omaha?

1325
02:23:05,379 --> 02:23:09,578
Nothing since the first message:
heavy fighting, heavy casualties.

1326
02:23:09,785 --> 02:23:11,878
Sir.

1327
02:23:14,324 --> 02:23:15,552
Omaha?

1328
02:23:17,428 --> 02:23:18,452
No.

1329
02:23:22,101 --> 02:23:25,924
I can't understand
why Jerry hasn't brought his heavy armor into play.

1330
02:23:26,807 --> 02:23:29,401
All the panzer divisions except the 21st...

1331
02:23:29,677 --> 02:23:32,202
...seem to be sitting it out in the rear.

1332
02:23:32,815 --> 02:23:33,839
Sir.

1333
02:23:37,053 --> 02:23:40,717
"French commandos driving inland from Sword...

1334
02:23:40,858 --> 02:23:43,281
...have reached the outskirts of Ouistreham."

1335
02:23:43,929 --> 02:23:45,487
Ouistreham.

1336
02:26:36,351 --> 02:26:38,012
Fall back!

1337
02:26:40,823 --> 02:26:42,415
Take cover!

1338
02:26:58,179 --> 02:27:02,276
Tank support! We must have tank support!

1339
02:27:03,586 --> 02:27:09,378
Hello, Bastille. Hello, Batille.
This is Windsor. Come on, Bastille!

1340
02:27:27,450 --> 02:27:28,781
Fire!

1341
02:27:36,295 --> 02:27:38,718
Attention!

1342
02:27:39,132 --> 02:27:40,565
Fire!

1343
02:27:44,305 --> 02:27:48,595
Hello, Bastille. Hello, Batille.
This is Windsor. Come on, Bastille!

1344
02:27:48,844 --> 02:27:50,539
I can't get them!

1345
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:53,007
Keep trying! We must have support!

1346
02:27:53,650 --> 02:27:58,008
Hold your positions. I'm going for a tank!

1347
02:27:59,291 --> 02:28:01,748
Give us as much cover as you can!

1348
02:28:22,187 --> 02:28:24,610
The bridge, right!

1349
02:28:49,856 --> 02:28:51,221
Fire!

1350
02:28:56,297 --> 02:28:57,662
Try for the cannon!

1351
02:29:03,273 --> 02:29:05,730
Get the wounded out of here!

1352
02:29:33,779 --> 02:29:34,803
Go back!

1353
02:29:35,649 --> 02:29:37,014
Get out of here!

1354
02:29:38,819 --> 02:29:40,775
No! Go back!

1355
02:29:56,041 --> 02:29:58,202
You can't stay here!

1356
02:29:58,444 --> 02:30:01,208
I am Mother Superior of the convent.

1357
02:30:01,448 --> 02:30:03,905
The Sisters are qualified nurses.

1358
02:30:04,185 --> 02:30:09,385
But madame-- I mean, Mother, we're in the middle of a battle!

1359
02:30:10,594 --> 02:30:14,361
Excuse me. Take care of the wounded.

1360
02:30:49,911 --> 02:30:50,935
It's a tank!

1361
02:30:53,649 --> 02:30:55,082
It's Kieffer!

1362
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:07,489
In the other direction!

1363
02:31:18,414 --> 02:31:21,804
Clear away the debris! Hurry!

1364
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:01,188
But where is the Luftwaffe?!

1365
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:04,564
-I'm trying.
-Yeah, yeah, you're trying.

1366
02:32:12,717 --> 02:32:17,417
The British troops have a beachhead here.
They are moving inland.

1367
02:32:17,623 --> 02:32:23,517
The Americans hold Ste-Mere-Eglise and have cut the highway.

1368
02:32:23,731 --> 02:32:26,859
We control this center section.

1369
02:32:27,503 --> 02:32:32,737
The Americans have landed but their attack has bogged down.

1370
02:32:33,377 --> 02:32:36,232
Rommel is right.

1371
02:32:36,515 --> 02:32:39,973
If we can hold them on the beaches...

1372
02:32:40,219 --> 02:32:42,210
...the invasion will collapse.

1373
02:33:17,367 --> 02:33:18,925
Medic!

1374
02:33:19,136 --> 02:33:20,228
That thing still work?

1375
02:33:20,572 --> 02:33:22,597
Yes, sir, now and then.

1376
02:33:22,841 --> 02:33:25,332
-Anything from the other beaches?
-Not directly.

1377
02:33:25,611 --> 02:33:29,275
A while ago the sergeant picked up some flashes
from the destroyers.

1378
02:33:30,083 --> 02:33:34,214
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach and moving inland.

1379
02:33:34,456 --> 02:33:35,821
Inland?

1380
02:33:38,228 --> 02:33:41,356
-What about the 1st Division?
-They're hung up, sir.

1381
02:33:41,599 --> 02:33:42,998
Like we are.

1382
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:48,804
Move out.

1383
02:33:58,253 --> 02:34:00,710
Medic!

1384
02:34:08,132 --> 02:34:10,498
-What do you think?
-Think?

1385
02:34:11,403 --> 02:34:14,702
We must have close to 1000 casualties up to now.

1386
02:34:14,874 --> 02:34:17,536
Do you want me to have the ships start picking us up?

1387
02:34:18,345 --> 02:34:20,973
-You think it's that bad?
-I don't see what else to do.

1388
02:34:21,183 --> 02:34:23,014
We can't get up this hill.

1389
02:34:23,186 --> 02:34:26,212
If we don't get off this beach,
we won't have any division left.

1390
02:34:26,423 --> 02:34:28,152
What?

1391
02:34:28,358 --> 02:34:30,155
These are our men, Tom.

1392
02:34:30,361 --> 02:34:34,423
You think we brought them in
so some die and ask the rest to turn tail?

1393
02:34:34,667 --> 02:34:37,431
Hell, no. We're gonna get up that hill.

1394
02:34:37,671 --> 02:34:40,231
Find me somebody to speak for the Rangers.

1395
02:34:40,441 --> 02:34:43,205
Back down the beach on the right there's a gully.

1396
02:34:43,544 --> 02:34:48,471
With a heavily defended roadblock
and machine gun nests on both sides.

1397
02:34:48,685 --> 02:34:51,779
-If we can blow our way through--
-We've hit it three times.

1398
02:34:52,022 --> 02:34:54,445
-We didn't get close.
-Three times isn't enough.

1399
02:34:54,726 --> 02:34:57,854
We're gonna hit it again. Can you find me some engineers?

1400
02:34:58,064 --> 02:34:59,258
They're all around you!

1401
02:34:59,498 --> 02:35:01,830
I mean engineers with equipment still working.

1402
02:35:03,704 --> 02:35:05,467
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?

1403
02:35:05,707 --> 02:35:06,935
No, damn it!

1404
02:35:07,208 --> 02:35:11,270
We need bangalore torpedoes, bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...

1405
02:35:11,448 --> 02:35:14,144
...and every man that can stand. Pass the word, will you?

1406
02:35:15,953 --> 02:35:17,352
Okay, Norm.

1407
02:35:33,976 --> 02:35:36,365
Now listen to me, all of you.

1408
02:35:37,247 --> 02:35:39,374
You guys got to snap out of it.

1409
02:35:39,751 --> 02:35:42,515
We're getting off of here, and we're going inland.

1410
02:35:42,788 --> 02:35:45,746
What about weapons, general?  My men lost everything.

1411
02:35:45,958 --> 02:35:48,347
They gotta have something to fight with.

1412
02:35:48,561 --> 02:35:50,392
Strip the dead and the wounded.

1413
02:35:50,631 --> 02:35:52,622
Pick up anything that'll shoot.

1414
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:55,496
I don't have to tell you the score, you all know it.

1415
02:35:55,771 --> 02:35:58,660
Only two kinds of people are gonna stay on this beach:

1416
02:35:58,875 --> 02:36:02,835
Those that are already dead and those that will die.
Get off your butts!

1417
02:36:03,047 --> 02:36:05,777
You guys are the fighting 29th!

1418
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:25,069
I've looked at the naval reports.

1419
02:36:25,309 --> 02:36:26,401
Yes?

1420
02:36:27,211 --> 02:36:31,342
According to reports from the offshore destroyers,
Omaha is a shambles.

1421
02:36:31,818 --> 02:36:34,548
There's no evidence--
To quote the report exactly:

1422
02:36:34,788 --> 02:36:39,078
"There is no evidence of any movement
that can be observed off the beach."

1423
02:36:41,062 --> 02:36:42,893
I'd better have a look through these.

1424
02:36:46,403 --> 02:36:47,936
How is lke taking it?

1425
02:36:48,138 --> 02:36:51,927
Like everybody else, sir. Hanging on by his fingernails.

1426
02:36:54,346 --> 02:36:58,078
No, no! We must regroup according to Plan Six!

1427
02:37:02,324 --> 02:37:06,216
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

1428
02:37:06,529 --> 02:37:09,919
I said we must regroup according to Plan Six.

1429
02:37:11,035 --> 02:37:12,764
Nonsense!

1430
02:37:13,038 --> 02:37:16,303
If the panzers arrive, we still have time to use them.

1431
02:37:20,047 --> 02:37:22,072
We'll drive to the coast!

1432
02:37:22,549 --> 02:37:24,380
Shall we remove the files?

1433
02:37:24,786 --> 02:37:29,383
I don't care! I want to get to the front at once, to Normandy!

1434
02:37:29,591 --> 02:37:30,615
Yes, general.

1435
02:37:58,062 --> 02:38:00,428
-Where is everybody?
-What?

1436
02:38:02,835 --> 02:38:05,030
I said, where is everybody?

1437
02:38:07,474 --> 02:38:09,430
I can't hear you.

1438
02:38:10,678 --> 02:38:12,543
It's them bells.

1439
02:38:12,781 --> 02:38:15,636
I've had them in my ears for 10 hours.

1440
02:38:15,852 --> 02:38:18,844
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

1441
02:38:20,691 --> 02:38:22,818
Hey, sergeant, where's Major Lance?

1442
02:38:23,027 --> 02:38:25,484
We moved the CP to that building. The major's there.

1443
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:27,596
Get him, the colonel's here.

1444
02:38:29,102 --> 02:38:30,262
What?

1445
02:38:32,272 --> 02:38:34,263
Hold it!

1446
02:38:44,088 --> 02:38:46,352
Colonel, am I glad to see you!

1447
02:38:47,526 --> 02:38:50,586
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

1448
02:38:50,863 --> 02:38:53,252
Why are you leaving them up there?  Get them down!

1449
02:38:53,534 --> 02:38:55,229
But we've been under fire, sir.

1450
02:38:55,536 --> 02:38:57,458
I know you have, but I don't care!

1451
02:38:57,705 --> 02:38:59,900
Get them down! Down!

1452
02:39:00,276 --> 02:39:04,236
-I don't want those boys left there.
-Take a detail and cut them down.

1453
02:39:04,548 --> 02:39:06,311
-At once!
-Yes, sir.

1454
02:39:10,556 --> 02:39:15,221
Has there been a linkup
between our forces and the troops from the sea?

1455
02:39:15,395 --> 02:39:19,628
I don't know, major.
I don't even know if the landings took place.

1456
02:39:19,867 --> 02:39:24,623
But I am sure we're gonna hold this town
until the linkup does come.

1457
02:39:24,907 --> 02:39:29,402
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow, till hell freezes over.

1458
02:39:31,081 --> 02:39:32,946
For their sake, if for no other reason.

1459
02:39:33,151 --> 02:39:35,642
Show me the enemy positions.

1460
02:39:35,854 --> 02:39:38,743
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point is right there.

1461
02:39:38,959 --> 02:39:41,792
That's over there on the hill. They've got no tanks yet.

1462
02:39:42,096 --> 02:39:46,090
They've got heavy guns, mortars and machine gun
positions at the top of that road.

1463
02:39:46,268 --> 02:39:48,532
How many men have you got?

1464
02:39:48,705 --> 02:39:49,797
Not enough.

1465
02:39:50,106 --> 02:39:53,929
Captain and Lieutenant Wilson will take A Company
and reinforce Major Lance.

1466
02:39:54,612 --> 02:39:59,346
The rest of the command will follow us straight up that road.

1467
02:40:00,653 --> 02:40:01,677
Good luck, major.

1468
02:40:01,954 --> 02:40:04,479
All right, A Company, fall out.

1469
02:40:04,725 --> 02:40:06,818
-Private.
-Yes, sir.

1470
02:40:06,995 --> 02:40:08,189
It's a hell of a war.

1471
02:40:08,396 --> 02:40:10,956
It's a privilege to serve with you, colonel.

1472
02:40:11,166 --> 02:40:15,194
Well, God willing, we'll do what we came here to do.

1473
02:40:15,405 --> 02:40:17,293
Ready, sir.

1474
02:40:17,642 --> 02:40:19,303
Move out!

1475
02:40:29,523 --> 02:40:33,085
The old man sure has changed since yesterday.

1476
02:40:39,002 --> 02:40:41,266
Or maybe it's just that we've changed...

1477
02:40:42,373 --> 02:40:44,000
...since yesterday.

1478
02:40:51,752 --> 02:40:54,380
Lovat and his commandos have reached the bridge.

1479
02:40:55,490 --> 02:40:56,923
Bob, did you hear?

1480
02:40:57,659 --> 02:40:59,183
Yes, I heard.

1481
02:41:00,663 --> 02:41:05,124
"Sainte-Mere-Eglise captured by units of the 82nd Airborne."

1482
02:41:06,971 --> 02:41:09,804
" 101 Airborne driving on Utah."

1483
02:41:10,042 --> 02:41:12,738
That's good. Good.

1484
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:18,073
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

1485
02:41:18,286 --> 02:41:21,744
We'll have two cut-off beachheads,
one in British zone and one at Utah.

1486
02:41:21,957 --> 02:41:22,981
Yes...

1487
02:41:23,326 --> 02:41:25,487
...and the Germans in between.

1488
02:41:40,982 --> 02:41:42,813
You guys engineers?

1489
02:41:44,253 --> 02:41:45,982
Yes, sir, 299th.

1490
02:41:46,222 --> 02:41:49,111
Where are your officers? Who's in charge here?

1491
02:41:49,727 --> 02:41:52,218
I guess I am, sir.  None of our officers made it in.

1492
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:54,455
What about your equipment? Those torpedoes work?

1493
02:41:54,733 --> 02:41:56,655
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!

1494
02:41:58,037 --> 02:42:00,733
-What's your name, sergeant?
-It's Fuller, sir, John H.

1495
02:42:01,008 --> 02:42:04,501
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,
whether you like it or not.

1496
02:42:07,083 --> 02:42:10,611
You send some men down to the foot of that gully with those torpedoes.

1497
02:42:10,888 --> 02:42:14,620
-You and the rest of the men follow me.
-Yes, sir!

1498
02:42:14,893 --> 02:42:18,421
All right, men! Let's move that equipment down here.

1499
02:42:24,839 --> 02:42:28,263
-I got a rifle, sir.
-Well, good for you, son!

1500
02:42:28,911 --> 02:42:30,401
The Rangers are ready, general.

1501
02:42:30,579 --> 02:42:32,968
Okay, major, move them out.

1502
02:42:33,149 --> 02:42:35,879
Captain, move them up.

1503
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:38,315
Move them up!

1504
02:42:40,525 --> 02:42:42,390
-Well, Tom?
-We're ready.

1505
02:42:42,628 --> 02:42:44,255
As ready as we'll ever be.

1506
02:42:44,497 --> 02:42:47,330
It'll work. It's got to work.

1507
02:42:49,103 --> 02:42:53,495
We're getting murdered here!
We might as well move inland and get murdered!

1508
02:42:57,514 --> 02:42:59,072
-You ready?
-Yes, sir.

1509
02:42:59,317 --> 02:43:01,945
You're gonna blow that roadblock for me.

1510
02:43:02,186 --> 02:43:04,711
When I give the word everything pops at once. Okay?

1511
02:43:04,957 --> 02:43:07,323
Yes, sir.

1512
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:37,090
First, we gotta blow a hole through that wire with bangalores.

1513
02:43:37,366 --> 02:43:41,428
If that works, we'll pack everything we've got into that wall.

1514
02:43:42,405 --> 02:43:43,963
All right, let's go!

1515
02:46:43,738 --> 02:46:48,335
All right, let's go! Go! Go!

1516
02:47:47,688 --> 02:47:51,250
We must leave. The main highway is under aerial attack.

1517
02:47:51,492 --> 02:47:53,187
You don't say!

1518
02:49:30,721 --> 02:49:32,177
Don't worry, Yank.

1519
02:49:37,363 --> 02:49:38,421
He's dead.

1520
02:50:00,025 --> 02:50:03,848
Give me a cigarette. I'm dying for a cigarette.

1521
02:50:11,739 --> 02:50:13,172
You hurt bad?

1522
02:50:17,113 --> 02:50:19,104
Shot down during the night.

1523
02:50:23,055 --> 02:50:27,220
He was gonna make sure of me, but I got him...

1524
02:50:27,627 --> 02:50:29,083
...with this.

1525
02:50:39,776 --> 02:50:43,702
You ever killed a man? I mean, face to face?

1526
02:50:45,583 --> 02:50:47,608
No.

1527
02:50:47,786 --> 02:50:51,450
Neither had l, face to face.

1528
02:50:54,962 --> 02:50:57,419
I've been sitting here looking at him.

1529
02:50:59,101 --> 02:51:01,763
Have you noticed anything peculiar about him?

1530
02:51:11,684 --> 02:51:13,709
No.

1531
02:51:14,621 --> 02:51:16,248
He's got his boots...

1532
02:51:16,623 --> 02:51:18,750
...on the wrong feet.

1533
02:51:26,302 --> 02:51:28,224
He must have been in a big hurry, huh?

1534
02:51:30,474 --> 02:51:31,702
Is it bad?

1535
02:51:34,646 --> 02:51:36,477
Split wide open...

1536
02:51:37,683 --> 02:51:39,878
...from the crotch to the knee.

1537
02:51:40,654 --> 02:51:44,580
A medic came along and gave me a shot of morphine.

1538
02:51:47,363 --> 02:51:49,923
I hope he'll be back before it wears off.

1539
02:51:51,168 --> 02:51:52,499
He said he would.

1540
02:51:55,439 --> 02:51:57,134
Did he sew you up?

1541
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:06,009
Well, when he came ashore he lost most of his equipment.

1542
02:52:07,689 --> 02:52:09,520
So he pinned it together...

1543
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,619
...with safety pins.

1544
02:52:24,277 --> 02:52:25,835
Getting on toward night.

1545
02:52:34,023 --> 02:52:35,285
You know something?

1546
02:52:36,826 --> 02:52:38,817
I haven't fired my gun all day.

1547
02:52:39,330 --> 02:52:43,119
I keep hearing shooting,
but every time I get there, everybody's gone.

1548
02:52:47,073 --> 02:52:48,506
Funny, isn't it?

1549
02:52:49,876 --> 02:52:51,104
He's dead.

1550
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:54,007
I'm crippled.

1551
02:52:55,251 --> 02:52:56,843
You're lost.

1552
02:52:59,389 --> 02:53:01,277
I suppose it's always like that.

1553
02:53:03,261 --> 02:53:04,785
I mean war.

1554
02:53:12,273 --> 02:53:14,104
I wonder who won.

1555
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:59,692
Okay, run me up the hill, son.
