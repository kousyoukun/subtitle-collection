1
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:32,546
London calling... with Frenchmen
speaking to their countrymen.

2
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:35,534
Take a look at that! What
a handsome sight...

3
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:38,239
...the pride of the Third Reich!d

4
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:42,414
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.e

5
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:47,912
So that's a sample of the
master race! In a pig's eye!a

6
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:37,328
In this darkest hour, in
the gloom of night...

7
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,432
...we must not despair..

8
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,305
For each of us...s

9
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:52,377
...deliverance is coming!l

10
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,975
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.

11
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,240
At every beach, on every dune...

12
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:29,680
...on every rock.

13
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,978
How many have been installed?

14
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,781
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.

15
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:45,130
The work has completely
exhausted our troops.

16
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:49,761
Which would your troops rather be...

17
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,997
...exhausted or dead?t

18
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,266
Just look at it, gentlemen.r

19
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:56,802
How calm...how peaceful it is.

20
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,875
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...

21
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,108
...between the Allies and us.

22
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:09,117
But beyond that peaceful
horizon...a monster waits!

23
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,189
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...

24
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:16,497
...straining to be released against us.

25
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,860
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.

26
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:31,146
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come, gentlemen...

27
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:36,677
...I shall destroy the enemy
there...at the water's edge!

28
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,478
Believe me, gentlemen.

29
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,180
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.

30
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:48,326
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

31
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,658
...the longest day!e

32
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:29,369
The poem by Verlaine?f

33
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,038
Play it back!a

34
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:44,644
Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.

35
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,654
Here are some personal messages.

36
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:56,528
''The long sobs of the violins of autumn. ''

37
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,024
I repeat:r

38
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:02,100
''The long sobs of the violins of autumn. ''

39
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:06,199
Have you notified all commands?

40
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:21,221
lf Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...

41
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,689
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.

42
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,290
Give me the text of the second verse.

43
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,004
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor.''

44
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:54,851
We've intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year...hundreds!

45
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,254
I've ordered alerts again and again.a

46
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:02,521
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?

47
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,199
Tell me this:

48
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,064
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?

49
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,670
Of course it doesn't.e

50
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:20,704
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...

51
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:25,576
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?

52
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:29,747
No, Blumentritt...no alert!.

53
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,192
And especially not in this weather!l

54
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,794
-Anything else?
-No, sir.n

55
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,609
Good morning, Field Marshal.u

56
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,754
-Any news?
-Nothing important.

57
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,754
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.

58
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,292
Nothing much happened
last night...the storm.

59
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:10,328
That's all I'm interested in
this morning...the storm.

60
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:16,095
It came from nowhere...
blew my roses to bits.

61
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,967
There are five-foot waves
in the Channel...

62
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,770
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.y

63
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,443
For the month of June...y

64
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:29,173
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.

65
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:31,817
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?e

66
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,586
General Jodl will see the Führer today...l

67
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,520
...and confirm the appointment for you.

68
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,424
Will you still go to Germany as planned?

69
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,294
Can you think of a better time?

70
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:51,864
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.

71
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:40,888
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

72
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,380
Snap it up.l

73
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,321
Jerk the lead.o

74
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:47,154
Snap it up.a

75
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,351
Jerk the lead.o

76
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,929
You expect us to eat this slop again?i

77
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,032
I don't care what you do with it, mac.

78
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,998
Eat it, throw it out.n

79
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,761
I get paid for cooking it.t

80
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,735
Come on. Put it on.a

81
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,567
Snap it up.g

82
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,210
Jerk the lead.

83
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,244
Didn't you get any sleep?g

84
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:09,441
Are you kidding? I haven't slept
since we got here.

85
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:14,081
I got the absolute lowdown.

86
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:17,287
It's on for tonight. For sure.

87
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,856
Yeah.n

88
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,423
I got in this crap game
with this guy from F Company.

89
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,533
-He's an orderly for some general.
-Move it. Move it.

90
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,937
Hey, Hutchy!

91
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,234
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.

92
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:36,635
Hey, Hutchinson...r

93
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,575
...do you think they'd let me write
home? lf it was really important?

94
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,807
Not likely, mate. Security.

95
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,283
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

96
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,150
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.

97
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,549
Your first, is it?

98
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,990
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead
worried about her.

99
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,424
She's not too strong, you see.

100
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,620
Man, that stink.t

101
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,297
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.

102
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:32,759
And there ain't no place left
to get sick in.u

103
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,297
The puke bags is full.

104
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,802
The fire buckets is full.d

105
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,802
All we got left is our helmets.

106
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,669
June.o

107
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,511
Every June my old man
used to take me camping...

108
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,317
...up in the Blue Mountains.

109
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,458
We'd hunt and fish all day long.h

110
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:04,994
And at night...

111
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:09,001
...we'd sleep out under the stars.r

112
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:13,835
Didn't even need a blanket.a

113
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,980
June.n

114
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:27,816
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.a

115
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:29,388
Don't it ever stop?d

116
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,717
Look, Dad, all I want
to do is get going..

117
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:37,158
Wind or no wind. Even if we land
in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

118
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,865
-Come to think of it--
-Colonel wants us.

119
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,831
All of us.

120
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,476
All troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

121
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,847
In this weather, sir?

122
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:06,484
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure
that we'll land in France...

123
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,322
-...in sunshine and dry weather.
-Didn't mean that.

124
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,898
-What did you mean?
-It isn't the weather.

125
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,160
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.b

126
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,839
I don't think I have to remind you...w

127
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,373
...that this war has been going on
for almost five years.

128
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,009
Half of Europe has been
overrun and occupied.a

129
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,681
We're comparative newcomers.w

130
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:31,182
England's gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1 940.u

131
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:35,619
I am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go.

132
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:37,688
Do I make myself clear?

133
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,451
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

134
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:43,523
Three million men penned up
on this island.t

135
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:47,428
All over England,
in staging areas like this.

136
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:51,865
We're on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times.

137
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:54,269
Three million men out there...

138
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:59,379
...keyed up, and waiting for
that big step-off.

139
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,910
They aren't exactly alone.

140
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,480
Notify the men. Full packs
and equipment, 1 4:00 hours.

141
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:09,816
Yes, sir.e

142
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,926
This allows you more freedom.u

143
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:21,296
Quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach.g

144
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,971
-Well?
-It's on.h

145
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,000
Tonight, as scheduled.

146
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,975
-lf the weather isn't worse.
-How worse can it get?

147
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:33,409
lke has called a high-level
conference for 9:30.h

148
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,846
I am not Eisenhower. I am
an assistant division commander.

149
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:42,785
I don't know from nothing,
but he can't call it off again.

150
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,260
Frank, turn that thing off.s

151
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,931
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

152
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,690
Troops ready to go.

153
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,765
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

154
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,599
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

155
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:00,865
Norm, relax.t

156
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,541
RAF says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began.

157
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,111
So they told us yesterday
and the day before.i

158
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,841
Look, Norm.a

159
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,120
We're all of us just as...

160
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:16,813
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

161
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:19,027
And that includes lke.i

162
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:22,197
Now if he calls it off again,
he knows what he's doing.

163
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:25,125
Of course he does. I know that.

164
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:29,134
I'm just thinking about those
assault troops. 200,000 of them...

165
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:32,705
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.

166
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,707
Some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days.

167
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,207
I say go.s

168
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:42,009
Go. Weather or no weather.t

169
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,246
No!d

170
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,720
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

171
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:52,883
-Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
-I'm not doing so good myself.

172
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,832
Hey, lend me $50?w

173
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:11,604
-Lend me 20 bucks?
-Drop dead.

174
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,084
Lend me $10?s

175
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:27,951
-Fifty on a bet.
-I got it.o

176
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,221
One, two, three, four, five.

177
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:32,126
Fifty!c

178
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,202
Let me hear it, let me hear it.

179
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,874
-Five and two, four and three.
-Six! That's the way we go!

180
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,532
Seven points in a row. It ain't
logical, it just ain't logical.

181
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:48,647
-There's a hundred out there.
-$100 dollars, $20 dollars.

182
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,407
Anything open?n

183
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,586
-Forty more.
-Forty more.

184
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,449
You got a bet.t

185
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:58,784
-Okay, you mother-loving--
-Just a minute. Wait a minute.

186
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:01,323
Here you are. Use this.

187
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,997
-You don't think I'd--
-I don't think anything.

188
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:07,566
I just like to hear the sound
when it comes out of the cup.

189
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,405
That's it. Shake it.k

190
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,268
Okay. Let me see what you do
with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.

191
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,069
-What is it?
-Nothing.l

192
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,144
-Seven!
-That's what I wanted!

193
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:22,644
Who put this cup in the game?

194
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:25,647
-Next shooter. Who's coming up?
-I'll go $100.e

195
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,481
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?

196
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,021
-Watch your side bets.
-$100.

197
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:35,356
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?i

198
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,765
Yeah, that's it..

199
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,596
Thanks, buddy.n

200
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:53,675
-How much did you take him for?
-Not much. Just a hair over $2500.

201
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,282
-$2500?
-Yeah.c

202
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,849
Oh, man, $2500?u

203
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,181
It's too bad you had to win it now..

204
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:03,954
What do you mean, now?e

205
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,219
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?w

206
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:12,727
Five I take with me to Paris
to blow on the broads and wine.

207
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:15,402
A thou I leave here for seed
when I get back.t

208
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,798
And the rest I send to my mother.

209
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,553
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.

210
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,423
You always was lucky.n

211
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,567
Hey, remember that night
in Fort Bragg?

212
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,037
I remember it.o

213
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:56,901
You know, I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

214
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,078
Why not? What's to lose?

215
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,218
Damn it.u

216
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,955
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

217
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:14,423
I was lucky, all right,
in that crap game.

218
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,392
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

219
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,128
And two months in traction.

220
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,316
$2500.

221
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,548
That's more money I ever had
in my whole life.

222
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:48,818
I know.y

223
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:53,060
Man, I just know.o

224
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:09,775
I wonder how long it takes
to lose $2500?

225
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,192
Pint of sludge, Ted.r

226
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,403
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?

227
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:35,836
Yes.a

228
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,444
Well, where is he?

229
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,848
Come on, Dave.

230
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,682
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.c

231
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:47,880
Where is he?a

232
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,957
At the bottom...t

233
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:51,785
...of the Channel.F

234
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,128
You mean...s

235
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:05,134
...he's bought it?o

236
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,637
Ack-ack over Calais.k

237
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:11,869
He jumped clean,
but his parachute didn't open.s

238
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,022
That leaves just you
in the squadron, Dave.

239
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,694
I mean, of the old 1 940 mob.r

240
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:30,729
What's always worried me
about being one of the few...

241
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,559
...is the way we keep on
getting fewer.

242
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,432
Yeah.

243
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,529
Poor old Johnny.

244
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,536
Bad luck, it happening now.

245
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:46,202
-Now, then. What's the difference?
-He went through the Battle of Britain!

246
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,747
And now if the big show
starts tonight...

247
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,885
...he won't be in it.s

248
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,848
Look, will you please
shut up about him?

249
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:58,390
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,925
You heard something about tonight?

251
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,097
No, no. I haven't heard anything.a

252
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:07,529
-What are you talking about then?
-Well, it's just....

253
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:11,236
-Go on, go on.
-I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

254
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,906
-That's all.
-A feeling.r

255
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,410
Take your feeling somewhere else.e

256
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,373
I've got a letter to write.d

257
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,241
I've had this feeling since I woke up.a

258
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:24,616
I've had it with me all day long.t

259
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:27,084
I can't shake it off.b

260
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,986
It's tonight. I know it is.v

261
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,953
All right, it's tonight.

262
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:34,558
Suits me fine.u

263
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:37,596
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!e

264
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,057
I mean...

265
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,935
...as soon as I finish this beer.

266
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,920
-General, can you spare me a minute?
-Come in.

267
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,817
-Thank you.
-Can I get you coffee?

268
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,288
-No, thanks.
-I'll get some for myself.g

269
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,598
Is it still raining?

270
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,364
On and off, off and on.p

271
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,169
Sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

272
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:24,470
What?l

273
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,114
I say, sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

274
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:31,618
Good question.

275
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,309
What's on your mind, Van?

276
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,615
I'm concerned about the placement
of our drop zones.

277
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,051
Go on.t

278
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:41,854
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

279
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,394
...but you've given me
a tough nut to crack.

280
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:48,193
-It gets tougher every time I try.
-I know, Van.

281
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,963
Sainte-Mére-Eglise straddles
the only road the Germans can use...

282
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,699
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.

283
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,011
And it has to be held.p

284
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,872
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

285
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,646
-Can I use your board?
-Of course.

286
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,654
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

287
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:19,265
Down here is the swamp area
that the Germans have flooded.

288
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,436
And in between, four miles
from the town, is our drop zone.

289
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:26,070
Now if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot...i

290
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:29,174
...we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down.

291
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:32,607
lf we overshoot, we come down
like clay pigeons...

292
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:35,781
...smack dab in the center
of Sainte-Mére-Eglise.

293
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:40,545
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

294
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,382
So I've heard.w

295
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:48,253
Got a complaint from
the city council at Bexhall.

296
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:53,093
Some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town.

297
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,202
-Tied up traffic for an hour.
-That's true, sir. I was with them.

298
00:25:57,404 --> 00:26:00,238
Sudden crosswind hit us,
swept us over the treetops...

299
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,535
...scattered us all over the place.

300
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:09,115
-Where did you end up?
-In the courtyard of a convent.

301
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:12,108
Relax, Van. Sit down.

302
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:17,446
The last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us.

303
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:21,324
I hear you've been working yourself
and your battalion hard.

304
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:23,587
Almost without a stop.h

305
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:27,826
Now that we're almost
at the end of the line...

306
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:31,334
...why don't you try easing up
on yourself and on the men?

307
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,401
Sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point.y

308
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:38,676
Sometimes a commander can too.n

309
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:42,276
Well...

310
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:47,144
...if there's any further delay...

311
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,154
...I request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones.

312
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:53,484
All right. Put it in writing.

313
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:56,095
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.r

314
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,825
But lke has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

315
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:04,932
lf it's on, we'll get
the green light by 9:30.

316
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,972
-What are the chances?
-Better than 50-50.

317
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:12,371
Forget everything I said. I got
the best battalion in this division...

318
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:13,603
...and they're ready.

319
00:27:29,364 --> 00:27:31,627
Here it is. The latest report.

320
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:53,218
-It's Southwick House, sir.
-Stagg here.

321
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:57,250
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in
much faster than we thought.

322
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:00,592
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

323
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,429
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.-

324
00:28:10,904 --> 00:28:14,671
-Would you like some more tea, sir?
-Coffee, and make it black.r

325
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:15,900
Please.a

326
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,176
One moment, Colonel Priller.

327
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,039
Why wasn't he court-martialed?i

328
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:23,217
He shot down 132 planes.n

329
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,191
Don't call me ''Pips, old boy.''h

330
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,858
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.c

331
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:37,588
You're flying a desk now, but
you're still a rotten pilot!

332
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,897
What's that you're saying?e

333
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:45,402
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...

334
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:50,101
...with only two planes...
two stinking crates!

335
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,146
Oh, sure, sure...your
orders were followed!o

336
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,613
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!c

337
00:28:58,118 --> 00:29:03,250
My supplies are all gone. What
am I supposed to do now?d

338
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:08,656
But Pips, we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons...we had to!

339
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:13,230
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!

340
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:16,268
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

341
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,663
You move us back instead of forward!

342
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:25,811
Sure, I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...o

343
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:29,142
...but what would happen if they did?

344
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:33,512
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.i

345
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,417
I tell you, you're all crazy!

346
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,069
Priller has always been a hothead...

347
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:01,009
...but let's not underestimate him.

348
00:30:01,982 --> 00:30:04,780
What he says is not entirely illogical.o

349
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:07,515
What's the weather report?e

350
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:10,054
Slightly better over the Channel.t

351
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:13,221
I wouldn't be surprised if--

352
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:18,864
-When's the next weather report?
-Tonight at 8, General.

353
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,326
lKeep me posted on the weather.o

354
00:30:23,337 --> 00:30:25,464
You made my dinner reservations?

355
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,470
Yes, I did, General.

356
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,369
Cancel everything.m

357
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:49,154
Shoes for my wife, I had them
specially made in Paris...

358
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,298
...for her birthday...tomorrow,
the sixth of June.

359
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,902
Please wish her a happy birthday.

360
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,571
Thank you, Speidel.e

361
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:05,166
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect....

362
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,243
An attack now would be embarrassing.

363
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:15,747
But I don't think we need worry.

364
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,736
Is the plan ready, sir?

365
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:43,580
Yes, yes, quite finished.

366
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,742
War games...a

367
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,654
...theoretical invasions.h

368
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:57,631
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.

369
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:02,558
Playing at war!m

370
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,969
Do you win or lose, sir?.

371
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,809
Have I ever lost?

372
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:18,585
But General, this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.

373
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:22,586
I win because I go against the rules.

374
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,354
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...

375
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:32,463
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple...too obvious.

376
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:37,798
I choose the widest part, in the
worst weather...and attack here.

377
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,339
In Normandy.y

378
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:42,435
And in bad weather!h

379
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,009
Like now...n

380
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,113
...bad weather!

381
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,614
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

382
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:59,019
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

383
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,421
And Normandy?d

384
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:04,222
High winds, clouds,
and some fog over the beaches.

385
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:08,560
However, I can say with a certain
degree of safety...

386
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:12,067
...that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions.

387
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,297
Let me summarize, then.r

388
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:19,676
What you're promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions.

389
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,005
Am I right?i

390
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,340
Yes.n

391
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:26,179
Conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements.

392
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:28,820
That's all I can promise.

393
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:32,423
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.

394
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,354
Well...o

395
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:40,200
...there it is.o

396
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:44,003
We've postponed the attack
once already.i

397
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:48,667
Now, either we go on the 6th,
with only marginal conditions...

398
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,440
...or postpone again...l

399
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,369
...in the hope of getting
perfect conditions.

400
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,242
What do you think, Monty?

401
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,544
I say, go. Go.m

402
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,049
I must remind everybody...i

403
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:05,191
...that the American convoy
for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

404
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:07,258
...they've farthest to go...o

405
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:10,760
...must be given the order
within the next half-hour...

406
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,195
...if the assault is to take place
on the 6th.g

407
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,300
We can't keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships....

408
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:24,545
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.n

409
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:28,875
The longer we wait, the more
acute our security problem.?

410
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:30,809
The next time...n

411
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:33,543
...the tides and the moon
will be right....n

412
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,418
Not before July.

413
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,324
Gentlemen...

414
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,298
...such a postponement...e

415
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:51,731
...is too bitter to contemplate.

416
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:58,637
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.

417
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:03,811
Fortunately, it's only a game.

418
00:35:05,152 --> 00:35:08,246
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

419
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:13,253
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.i

420
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:15,427
Never.b

421
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,597
I'm quite positive
we must give the order.

422
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:26,530
I don't like it...

423
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:28,635
...but there it is.a

424
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,438
Gentlemen...

425
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:35,375
...I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else but go.

426
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,889
Wilson speaking.l

427
00:35:54,635 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes, sir.a

428
00:35:59,673 --> 00:36:03,474
It's on, sir. Ike's made the
decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

429
00:36:18,326 --> 00:36:20,157
Colonel Tomson speaking.

430
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:25,255
Thank you.t

431
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:31,668
Next stop...v

432
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,396
...Normandy.o

433
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:37,402
God help us now.a

434
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,289
Gentlemen...a

435
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,963
...the day we've been
waiting for has arrived.n

436
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:02,061
Invasion! We're on our way.c

437
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:09,766
General.h

438
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:14,543
The orders have been given.
It's on.P

439
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:19,813
Have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom.

440
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:32,422
All right, Sergeant.e

441
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:37,465
You men are the eyes
of our airborne army.

442
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:42,634
You, the pathfinders, will have
one job, and one job only:

443
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:46,610
To light the drop zones
for our paratroops.

444
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:50,579
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

445
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:53,583
...to land in France.
And remember this:

446
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,652
When you get to Normandy...

447
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,251
...you'll only have one friend:

448
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:00,152
God.

449
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,126
And this.t

450
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,668
This...n

451
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,137
...is Rupert.,

452
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,938
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...T

453
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:17,974
...and a lot more like him...

454
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,271
...behind the invasion area.

455
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:23,875
He's...!

456
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,112
...a very extraordinary
fellow, Rupert.

457
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:29,983
He's sort of a...

458
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,659
...one-man army, all by himself.e

459
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:34,958
Let me show you.n

460
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:39,298
Let me show you what happens
when Rupert...

461
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,023
...hits the ground.!

462
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,231
Sergeant, switch off
the lights, please.k

463
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:53,036
All right, Sergeant, that's all.

464
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,815
All right, come on. Simmer down.o

465
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,175
Come on, up.,

466
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:06,648
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

467
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,829
Confuse them, make them look
over their shoulders...

468
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,659
...and launch an attack
in the wrong direction.

469
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:23,708
Ten-hut!t

470
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:28,246
-The crickets have been distributed.
-So I heard.r

471
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,581
At ease!v

472
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,853
You're as ready as we can make you.

473
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,420
This five-cent toy...

474
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,452
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

475
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:45,630
It may save your life.

476
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,429
You're gonna be landing in the dark.u

477
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:51,771
On the other side of that hedgerow...

478
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:56,534
...the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are. So...

479
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,371
...one click...,

480
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,206
...is to be answered by two clicks.

481
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,813
And if you don't
get that answering click...

482
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:08,380
...hit the dirt and open fire.h

483
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:09,612
I repeat:r

484
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,655
One click...

485
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:14,121
...must be answered by two clicks.e

486
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:19,128
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.

487
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,056
Do you read me?d

488
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:23,235
Loud and clear, sir.d

489
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:25,666
All right. One more thing.

490
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:28,568
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

491
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:31,668
You can't give the enemy a break.

492
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:34,777
Send them to hell.v

493
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:41,947
That is all.

494
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:53,762
London calling with messages
for our friends.

495
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:03,675
''Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac. ''s

496
00:41:08,449 --> 00:41:11,282
''John has a long mustache. ''

497
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:12,543
I repeat:e

498
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:15,652
''John has a long mustache. ''

499
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,318
''John has a long mustache!''

500
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,865
No, not yet....o

501
00:41:37,143 --> 00:41:38,543
Oh, my Lord!,

502
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:03,333
''John has a long mustache.''h

503
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,202
Make any sense to you, mac?o

504
00:42:36,603 --> 00:42:40,869
As I said last night, they're code
messages to the Resistance chaps.

505
00:42:41,108 --> 00:42:44,043
Obviously, one message means
something to one group...

506
00:42:44,244 --> 00:42:46,543
...and another means something
to another group.

507
00:42:47,547 --> 00:42:52,815
''There is a fire at the travel agency. ''

508
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,916
I repeat:

509
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:02,088
''There is a fire at the travel agency. ''

510
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:06,833
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. ''

511
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:08,260
I repeat:r

512
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,565
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. ''

513
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:28,110
The bridge...in forty-five minutes.

514
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:39,364
We'll be back.

515
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,268
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. ''

516
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:53,376
I repeat:a

517
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:57,481
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. ''

518
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,987
''There is a fire at the travel agency. ''w

519
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:17,027
The best hand I've had all night.

520
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:19,501
Let me see here....t

521
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,007
Pardon me.e

522
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:29,239
Pardon me, General...it's come!

523
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,882
Wait. Give that to me.

524
00:44:32,385 --> 00:44:33,579
What's come?s

525
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,583
It's the second part of the message.

526
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,251
The second verse.g

527
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:41,188
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor.''l

528
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,190
''Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor.''

529
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:50,568
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!

530
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:54,771
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.

531
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,576
Thank you.c

532
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:11,418
You know, I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.

533
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:16,186
Now...where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!

534
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,759
It's almost impossible to believe.

535
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:48,889
Every dot represents a ship.

536
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:53,090
You got battlewagons, cruisers,
destroyers, minesweepers.

537
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,463
You got assault craft of every size
and every type.

538
00:45:58,605 --> 00:46:01,266
The biggest armada
the world's ever known.

539
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,778
Here.b

540
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,445
You remember it.

541
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:15,016
Remember every bit of it.

542
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:17,181
We're on the eve of a day...

543
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:21,155
...that people will talk about
long after we're dead and gone.

544
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,467
You wanna know something?i

545
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:38,333
It gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it.

546
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,824
You could call it one of them...

547
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:55,050
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages,
you know?

548
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:58,492
Met at a dance at the USO
and all that...m

549
00:46:58,798 --> 00:47:00,733
...but, I mean, I took it serious.a

550
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:04,197
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.

551
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:07,235
-When did you get the letter?
-Week ago.

552
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:08,565
Two weeks.

553
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:13,471
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

554
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:17,639
I mean, she's a high-class model
and all, and I....

555
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:23,422
I'm not the kind of guy
to get married that easy.

556
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,748
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

557
00:47:30,831 --> 00:47:35,563
But oh, man, we really had some
wonderful times together.

558
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:39,432
And you think she's got a boyfriend?t

559
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:44,376
Well, she never actually said so....

560
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:46,342
I mean....

561
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:51,411
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?

562
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:55,619
She can't get one
without your permission, right?

563
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,686
You gotta give your okay.e

564
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,514
I know it's the law.

565
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:02,559
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

566
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:13,271
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to the outfit.

567
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:18,210
Good luck.

568
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:21,271
You too.

569
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,489
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?

570
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:39,561
I don't know, Sparrow.

571
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:43,128
I never saw him before in my life.

572
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:10,157
Happy birthday, General...
from your staff!

573
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:15,929
Thank you.

574
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,467
Will you cut the cake, sir?

575
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,601
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it, too!

576
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:52,697
What's that?

577
00:49:53,373 --> 00:49:57,639
Dummkopf, that's the "V for
victory'' sign. Three dots and a dash.

578
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:02,876
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

579
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,355
Release point coming up, Major Howard.

580
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,851
Right, prepare for landing.

581
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,525
Cutting loose now.

582
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:48,751
Roger and out.

583
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,985
Major Howard, I cannot overestimate
the importance of your task.

584
00:51:19,259 --> 00:51:23,456
The Orne River Bridge must be captured
before the enemy can destroy it.

585
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:28,599
It's a vital military artery, and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition.

586
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:33,130
It must be taken by surprise
and captured intact.

587
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:37,768
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.

588
00:51:37,978 --> 00:51:40,673
You will assault the garrison,
overwhelm it...

589
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:43,074
...and hold until relieved.

590
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,675
Hold until relieved.

591
00:51:45,918 --> 00:51:47,112
Major Howard!

592
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,014
There's the bridge coming up.

593
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:52,184
Just on our left.

594
00:52:02,268 --> 00:52:03,929
Right, link your arms.

595
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,766
Brace yourselves.

596
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:29,954
Feet up!

597
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,126
Hang on!

598
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:39,958
Smoke screen. Smoke.

599
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:46,630
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!

600
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,144
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.

601
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,577
Check for demolition charges!

602
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:05,981
Hello! Hello!

603
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,965
Clear.

604
00:55:44,523 --> 00:55:46,320
It's working!

605
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:54,028
Where's the doc?

606
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:56,668
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.

607
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:58,101
Walsh.

608
00:55:58,338 --> 00:55:59,327
Sir?

609
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:02,201
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.

610
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,239
On the other end of the bridge.

611
00:56:04,443 --> 00:56:06,844
-What happened to you?
-Broke it on landing.

612
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:09,378
-Isn't the doc with you?
-No, he's missing.

613
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:13,018
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

614
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:15,653
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.

615
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:19,188
-Okay, carry on.
-Right, sir. Come on!

616
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,942
Well, I'll be....

617
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,074
Hey, doc! Doc!

618
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:49,449
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.

619
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:52,625
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

620
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:04,458
Sir?

621
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,936
The demolition charges have
been removed. It's all clear.

622
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:09,938
Good. Corporal Smith.

623
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:15,512
Send out the success code words.
I keep sending until acknowledged.

624
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:20,612
-John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
-Right, sir.

625
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:27,782
All in less than 1 5 minutes.

626
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,289
Only a matter of time before
they counterattack.

627
00:57:33,532 --> 00:57:37,663
-What about the paratroopers?
-7th Para might not get here for hours.

628
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:40,164
And Lovat and his commandos....

629
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,440
It could be midday
before they get here.

630
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:47,177
The question is,
how long can we hold?

631
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,775
Hold until relieved.

632
00:57:50,817 --> 00:57:52,681
Hold until relieved.

633
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,193
It's raining again.

634
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,626
Thank you.

635
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,960
Did you get the list?

636
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:18,007
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.

637
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:24,514
The Commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.

638
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:29,219
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd...
twelve officers in all.

639
00:58:30,356 --> 00:58:32,347
Yes, I know.

640
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:37,425
The weather is bad, so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

641
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:40,324
I don't like it.

642
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:41,864
Any of it.

643
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:45,264
So many key officers are
away at the same time.

644
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:47,699
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

645
00:58:48,675 --> 00:58:51,974
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week....

646
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:56,012
Yes, for tomorrow...not tonight.

647
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:02,047
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...

648
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,257
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.

649
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,291
May I remind you, General...

650
00:59:08,527 --> 00:59:12,259
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

651
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:16,561
North Africa...Sicily...ltaly....

652
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:18,793
Yes, and always at dawn!

653
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:30,280
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

654
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,713
Now, once more, I repeat:

655
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:36,655
lf, for any reason, we fail
to hit our drop zones...

656
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:38,753
...move north by east.

657
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,887
North by east.

658
00:59:41,393 --> 00:59:44,954
The Germans have flooded large
swamp areas behind the coast.

659
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:47,358
Avoid them if possible.

660
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:50,467
We came here to fight, not to swim.

661
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:52,235
Do you read me?

662
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,766
Loud and clear, sir.

663
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:17,121
How'd you make out?

664
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:20,028
How did you make out at the game?

665
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:22,956
I lost.

666
01:00:26,438 --> 01:00:28,771
Now we're both jumping clean.

667
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:49,958
I understand. And when will
the Field Marshal return?

668
01:00:51,931 --> 01:00:53,728
I see. Oh, well.

669
01:00:53,932 --> 01:00:55,331
Just a moment.

670
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:58,730
The radar report.

671
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:05,735
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...

672
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:08,577
...and radio reception is jammed.

673
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:15,052
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

674
01:01:15,253 --> 01:01:16,242
And the--

675
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,588
Call the OB West? Very well.

676
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:24,688
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.

677
01:01:57,896 --> 01:01:58,885
Bye, Rupert.

678
01:01:59,097 --> 01:02:02,396
Do your duty for God, king,
and your country.

679
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:09,461
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!

680
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:34,619
-Are we late?
-No, but...

681
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:36,378
...we must hurry!

682
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:49,487
What is it?

683
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,360
I'll go.

684
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:19,282
Stop!

685
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:21,619
We said, stop!

686
01:06:22,027 --> 01:06:24,018
Stop, or I'll shoot!

687
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,163
What are you doing here?

688
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:33,063
I live in that farm.

689
01:06:33,706 --> 01:06:36,697
Nobody lives in that farm.

690
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:40,639
-It's abandoned.
-Show me your papers.

691
01:06:42,213 --> 01:06:43,646
Hurry up!

692
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,481
Come with me.

693
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:52,150
Go on!

694
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:33,755
Put your bicycle there.

695
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:35,927
Hans!

696
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,869
Hans, where are you?

697
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:43,402
-What's going on here?
-Nothing!

698
01:07:43,943 --> 01:07:46,376
Who is with you? I want to know!

699
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:56,983
Stop!

700
01:07:57,456 --> 01:07:58,753
Stop!

701
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:12,936
Stop!

702
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,664
Stop!

703
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,605
Stop!

704
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,460
Good luck at the war games, General.

705
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,962
Anything important?

706
01:09:16,202 --> 01:09:20,036
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

707
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,375
The Underground again!

708
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:28,637
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.

709
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:30,704
Rubber dummies!

710
01:09:32,551 --> 01:09:34,484
Connect me with General Richter!

711
01:09:34,686 --> 01:09:39,715
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...

712
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:45,220
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.

713
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:53,030
Are you certain?

714
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:55,498
How many?

715
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,667
What do you think of it?

716
01:10:03,349 --> 01:10:04,838
Paratroopers....

717
01:10:11,256 --> 01:10:12,689
Put it over there.

718
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:23,431
This is what they dropped, they
explode on contact with the earth.

719
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,229
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

720
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:31,636
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.

721
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:45,886
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.

722
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,889
Connect me with General Pemsel!

723
01:10:53,265 --> 01:10:54,458
Dummies...?!

724
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,595
Rubber dummies!

725
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:03,463
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.

726
01:11:05,743 --> 01:11:07,644
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

727
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:11,304
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

728
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:17,244
They wouldn't drop dummies...

729
01:11:17,488 --> 01:11:20,252
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.

730
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:21,926
In this weather?

731
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:23,753
In any kind of weather!

732
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:26,931
I must get in touch with OB West.

733
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,079
They're enemy paratroopers!

734
01:12:38,337 --> 01:12:40,237
Blimey, mate...

735
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,567
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!

736
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:21,775
Fellas!

737
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:23,743
I'm hung up!

738
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:25,474
Fellas!

739
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:39,326
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

740
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:19,525
Where have you come from?

741
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:23,429
Awfully sorry, old man.

742
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:25,829
Simply landed here by accident.

743
01:15:32,377 --> 01:15:33,900
What's that?

744
01:15:34,712 --> 01:15:37,738
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.

745
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:38,881
Your what?

746
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:41,346
My communion set. I've lost it.

747
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:44,453
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for--

748
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:53,429
I'm sure that it was here
that I lost it.

749
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:16,710
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to--

750
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:20,618
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

751
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:24,922
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

752
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,265
I've got it! I've got it!

753
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,266
Glory be.

754
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:37,305
Now, my son, let's go
about God's work this night.

755
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:50,476
Pluskat.

756
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,024
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

757
01:17:00,865 --> 01:17:02,332
Nothing that I've heard....

758
01:17:04,636 --> 01:17:08,298
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

759
01:17:10,442 --> 01:17:12,706
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

760
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,702
Well, wait a minute.

761
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,845
Yes, just a moment.

762
01:17:31,662 --> 01:17:35,997
Flares...but a long way up the coast.

763
01:17:36,534 --> 01:17:39,527
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

764
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:42,563
There's probably nothing to it...

765
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,868
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.

766
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,072
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

767
01:17:51,682 --> 01:17:53,582
Thank you, sir.

768
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:14,097
Higher! Higher!

769
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:22,269
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!

770
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:30,180
Mayor Renaud, you must
come with me immediately.

771
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:33,789
-Is it important?
-Very important, Mayor Renaud.

772
01:18:43,902 --> 01:18:45,426
What's wrong, madam?

773
01:18:45,636 --> 01:18:48,697
I was on my way to the
little house outside....

774
01:18:49,106 --> 01:18:52,042
Suddenly, I saw a man
fall from the sky.

775
01:18:52,243 --> 01:18:54,269
-A parachutist?
-Yes, that's right.

776
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:55,969
He looked like a big white bird!

777
01:18:56,213 --> 01:18:58,306
-British or German?
-What?

778
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,881
The parachutist...was he
a friend or an enemy?

779
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:04,747
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just ''Shh!''

780
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:07,319
-Without a word?
-Just ''Shh!''

781
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,161
Bonjour, madame...

782
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:19,502
...je suis américain.

783
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:22,073
Bonjour, mademoiselle...

784
01:19:22,606 --> 01:19:24,073
...je suis américain.

785
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:28,244
We seem to be circling.

786
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:32,244
Maybe they're having difficulty
finding the drop zone.

787
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:34,783
Je suis...

788
01:19:34,985 --> 01:19:36,350
...américain.

789
01:19:36,587 --> 01:19:39,148
Je suis américain.

790
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:41,784
Voulez-vous...

791
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,192
...mademoiselle?

792
01:19:44,962 --> 01:19:45,987
Okay.

793
01:19:47,164 --> 01:19:48,496
Go!

794
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:50,662
Go!

795
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:25,362
Paratroopers!

796
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:48,365
Anything new?

797
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:52,565
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...

798
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:55,240
...and now near Caen.

799
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,176
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...

800
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,542
...but the direct line is open.

801
01:24:18,802 --> 01:24:20,737
I'll stay for a while.

802
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:25,470
-Would you like coffee?
-Yes, thank you.

803
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:09,677
For God's sakes, padre,
stop that damn noise.

804
01:25:09,921 --> 01:25:12,582
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

805
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:14,452
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

806
01:26:08,912 --> 01:26:10,038
Two clicks.

807
01:26:10,247 --> 01:26:12,375
I heard two clicks.

808
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,677
Man...

809
01:27:54,918 --> 01:27:56,819
...am I glad to see you.

810
01:27:57,622 --> 01:28:00,648
-You guys the 82nd?
-No. This is the 101 .

811
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,189
101 ?

812
01:28:02,426 --> 01:28:03,654
Where's the 82nd?

813
01:28:03,927 --> 01:28:07,261
Look, bud, we don't even know
where our own outfit is.

814
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:10,989
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

815
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:12,692
Let's us go find this war.

816
01:28:12,936 --> 01:28:14,268
Come on.

817
01:28:44,534 --> 01:28:47,368
Maybe they're Limeys
and ain't got no cricket.

818
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:52,032
They must be our guys.

819
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:57,046
Okay.

820
01:29:19,203 --> 01:29:20,829
No.

821
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:37,583
Hey.

822
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:40,280
Hey, they were Germans.

823
01:29:50,935 --> 01:29:54,962
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.

824
01:29:55,206 --> 01:29:56,867
Toward Caen.

825
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:05,043
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula...
something must be happening!

826
01:30:05,315 --> 01:30:10,447
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.

827
01:30:12,323 --> 01:30:16,088
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?

828
01:30:17,627 --> 01:30:20,391
No...nothing.

829
01:30:21,431 --> 01:30:23,764
Yes, I'll let you know right away.

830
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,399
Of course.

831
01:30:32,909 --> 01:30:35,344
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

832
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:37,274
Compound fracture, sir.

833
01:30:37,481 --> 01:30:40,451
Well, put the boot back on
and lace it up...

834
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,652
...tight.

835
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:43,615
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

836
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:45,618
And you're not walking on it.

837
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:50,157
-You're not going to try--
-I knock it off and do as you're told.

838
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:02,462
Yes?

839
01:31:02,707 --> 01:31:05,869
A, B and C Company are scattered
all over like we are.

840
01:31:06,144 --> 01:31:07,440
Go on.

841
01:31:07,645 --> 01:31:11,774
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke
his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

842
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:13,608
Any contact with F Company?

843
01:31:13,818 --> 01:31:17,845
No, but they must be up ahead
in the direction of Sainte-Mére-Eglise.

844
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,381
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.

845
01:31:26,831 --> 01:31:28,389
Well, here's where we are.

846
01:31:28,632 --> 01:31:30,533
The northern edge of the swamp area...

847
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:32,631
...five miles from our drop zone.

848
01:31:32,837 --> 01:31:34,667
Five miles.

849
01:31:35,472 --> 01:31:36,530
-F Company?
-No, sir.

850
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,902
And we've got scouts
all over the place.

851
01:31:39,143 --> 01:31:41,167
We even picked up a group
from the 101 .

852
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:45,371
F Company were the first
of the lead planes.

853
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:48,180
Well, give me a hand.

854
01:31:57,662 --> 01:31:59,390
Can I have my rifle?

855
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:11,872
Well, we'll head out this way.

856
01:32:12,243 --> 01:32:16,907
We ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak.

857
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:19,610
All right. Have the men spread out...

858
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,893
...pick up any stragglers
they can find.

859
01:32:23,129 --> 01:32:24,527
-Pass the word.
-Right, sir.

860
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:27,700
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.

861
01:32:27,901 --> 01:32:29,630
Pass the word down.

862
01:32:31,304 --> 01:32:32,702
All right...

863
01:32:33,005 --> 01:32:34,233
...let's go.

864
01:32:35,974 --> 01:32:39,501
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:

865
01:32:39,713 --> 01:32:42,807
American paratroopers have landed....

866
01:32:46,553 --> 01:32:48,179
British paratroopers....

867
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,151
The invasion....

868
01:32:59,698 --> 01:33:01,530
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.

869
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:06,099
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion!

870
01:33:06,339 --> 01:33:11,241
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:

871
01:33:11,443 --> 01:33:14,844
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.

872
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:17,380
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

873
01:33:17,584 --> 01:33:21,576
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...

874
01:33:22,389 --> 01:33:24,186
...where it was always expected.

875
01:33:27,794 --> 01:33:29,625
Where we always expected it!

876
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:32,888
But we can't take any chances.

877
01:33:33,098 --> 01:33:36,363
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!

878
01:33:36,568 --> 01:33:39,537
We need approval from the
Führer's headquarters.

879
01:33:39,738 --> 01:33:42,536
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

880
01:33:42,808 --> 01:33:47,803
Call the Führer's headquarters
and insist.

881
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:52,608
lnsist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!

882
01:33:57,424 --> 01:34:03,124
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.

883
01:34:04,296 --> 01:34:07,289
It would really be against all logic....
