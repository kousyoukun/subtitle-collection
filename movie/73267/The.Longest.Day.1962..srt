61
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,280
有没有通知所有指挥部

如果柏林方面是对的  那我们截听到第二节时

63
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,800
就表示入侵将在二十四小时内发动

64
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,400
给我看看第二节

我一而再再而三地下令戒备
I've ordered alerts again and again.

68
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,640
为什么这首诗会比其他信息有更多意味

69
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,300
告诉我

70
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,180
它会提供任何敌军何时何地入侵的线索吗

How can I maintain discipline if I keep my troops on the alert...

74
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,700
就因为柏林一对傻瓜截听到的一首诗  
just because a pair of nitwits in Berlin intercept a poem?

75
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,870
不  布鲁门特里特  不用戒备
No, Blumentritt, no alert.

并为您安排晋见
and confirm the appointment for you.

92
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,550
您还是要按计划去回德国吗

93
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,360
还能找到更好的时间吗

这种天气看来要持续到下星期

不想吃  扔掉好了

107
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,550
开玩笑  自打来这我就没睡过
Are you kidding? I haven't slept since we got here.

108
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,190

嘿  哈奇森

116
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,720
如果是重要行动  会让我们写信回家吗  
do you think they'd let me writehome? If it was really important?

117
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,950
不可能  伙计  得保密
Not likely, mate. Security.

老丘吉尔并不相信我们

她身体不是很好
She's not too strong, you see.

123
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,770
老兄  那儿真臭

我们就睡在星光之下

Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

138
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,550
还有完没完  
Don't it ever stop?

139
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,910
看  老爹  我只想着出发
Look, Dad, all I want to do is get going.

140
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,320
管它风还是雨  哪怕降落在艾菲尔铁塔上都行
Wind or no wind. Even if we land in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

141
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,020
-想想看  -中校找我们
- Come to think of it - Colonel wants us.

142
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,930
所有人

143
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,930
第五O五团第二营营长  本杰明・范迪沃特中校

144

今天碰头会之后

所有部队都要参与地面作战布署

148
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,970
在这种天气吗  头  
In this weather, sir?

149
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,650
当然  哈丁  你能保证降落在法国时  
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure that we'll land in France...

150
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,490

- in sunshine and dry weather. - Didn't mean that.

151
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,100
-那是什么意思  -不是指天气　　
- What did you mean? - It isn't the weather.

152
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,330
是等待时间  大伙都等不及了
It's the waiting. These men are itching to go.

153
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,960
我想用不着我来提醒你  
I don't think I have to remind you...

154
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,570
这场战争已经持续将近五年了
that this war has been going on for almost five years.

155
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,180
半个欧洲遭到侵占

156
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,870
我们是属于新来的
We're comparative newcomers.

157
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,370
英国从一九四○年起就一直面临入侵  如芒在背
England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940.

158
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,820
我相信他们也迫不及待地想要反攻
I am quite sure that they too are impatient and itching to go.

159
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,890
说得够清楚了吗  
Do I make myself clear?

160
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,690
是的  头  很清楚
Yes, sir. Quite clear.

161
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,690
有三百万人驻扎在这个岛上
Three million men penned up on this island.

162
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,630
象这样的兵营遍及整个英格兰

163
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,000
我们正处在有史以来最重要时刻的前沿
We're on the threshold of the most crucial day of our times.

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,440
三百万人在这

165
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,540
蓄势待发  就为了这一刻

166
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,120
实际上不止是他们

美军第二十九步兵师副师长  诺曼・D・科塔准将

170
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,830
他们说都能派上用场
They said they have both issues available.

171
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,130
我更喜欢这一款  比较宽松
I prefer this type. It allows you more freedom.

172
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,470
登陆后脱起来比较快
Quicker to get rid of when we hit the beach.

173
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,130
-怎么样  -定下来了

今晚  照计划进行

Ike has called a high- level conference for 9:30.

177
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,060
我不是艾森豪威尔  我是副师长
I am not Eisenhower. I am an assistant division commander.

178
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,990
我什么都不管  但他不能再取消
I don't know from nothing, but he can't call it off again.

179
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,510
弗兰克  关掉那玩意
Frank, turn that thing off.

180
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,100
四千艘船都已装备好
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

181
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,900
部队做好了出发准备
Troops ready to go.

182
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,940
一万一千架飞机在随时待命

183
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,740
加上一万八千伞兵和天知道有多少的滑翔机
Eighteen thousand paratroopers. God only knows how many gliders.

184
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,040
诺尔  放松点
Norm, relax.

185
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,750
皇家空军说大风随时可能停止
RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began.

186
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,290
所以他们前天昨天都这么对我们说
So they told us yesterday and the day before.

187
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,020
诺尔
Look, Norm.

188
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,250
我们所有人  
We're all of us just as...

189
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,030
都和你一样盼着开始行动
...dedicated to this thing as you are, just as anxious to get going.

190
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,230
也包括艾克
And that includes Ike.

191
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,400
如果他再次取消行动  一定有他的理由
Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing.

192
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,310
他当然有理由  这我知道
Of course he does. I know that.

193
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:28,280
我考虑的是突击部队  一共二十万人  
I'm just thinking about those assault troops. 200,000 of them...

194
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,880
呆在船上  恐怕吐得七荤八素了
...out there on those ships. They're probably seasick as hell.

195
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,910
有些人在"澡盆子"里呆了都快三天了
Some of those men have been on those tubs for almost three days.

196

-给我五十块我输光了  -我手气也不怎么样　
- Hey, give me 50 bucks. I'm busted. - I'm not doing so good myself.

201
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,020
借我五十块行吗  
Hey, lend me 50 bucks?

202
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,790
-借我二十块行吗  -去死吧

Seven points in a row.It ain't logical, it just ain't logical.

- There's 100 out there. - A hundred dollars, $20.

211

Anything open?

212
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,800
-再来四十  -再来四十

213
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,680
你有赌注了

- You don't think l'd - I don't think anything.

217
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,760
我只是想听到杯子发出的声音
I just like to hear the sound when it comes out of the cup.

218
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,620
就这样  摇吧
That's it. Shake it.

232
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,380
现在赢钱可不太妙
It's too bad you had to win it now.

233
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,120
"现在"是什么意思  
What do you mean, now?

234
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,420
要是今晚行动你拿这些有什么用

你总这么好运
You always was lucky.

240
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,760
记得在布拉格堡那晚吗

You know, I think I sneak over there and give it a big whang myself.

243
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,310
干嘛不呢  没什么可输的嘛  
Why not? What's to lose?

244
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,450

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,150
他干嘛提布拉格堡  
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?

246
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,670
那次掷骰子我手气很好
I was lucky, all right, in that crap game.

247
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,570
第二天空降就把腿弄断了

两千五百美元

伙计  我知道
Man, I just know.

253
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,030
我倒想知道输掉两千五百美元要多久
I wonder how long it takes to lose $2500.

254

他借走了我的靴子

261
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,140
他在哪

262
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,180
躺在  
At the bottom...

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,010

在加莱中了高射炮

他跳了出来  可降落伞没能打开
He jumped clean, ut his parachute didn't open.

268
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,270
这个中队只乘下你了  戴夫
That leaves just you in the squadron, Dave.

269
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,950
我是指一九四○年那一拨老兵
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.

270
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,790
我们这批人越变越少  正是我一直担心的事情之一
What's always worried me about being one of the few... ...is the way we keep on getting fewer.

271
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,660
是的
Yeah.

272
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,760
可怜的老约翰尼
Poor old Johnny.

273
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,770
运气真糟  在这当口
Bad luck, it happening now.

274
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,430
-这当口  有什么区别  -他和你一样捱过了不列颠战役
- Now, then. What's the difference? - He went through the Battle of Britain just like you!

275
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,010
要是今晚好戏上场  
And now if the big show starts tonight...

276
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,140
他就不能加入
...he won't be in it.

277
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,080
请不要再提他好吗  
Look, will you please shut up about him?

278
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,660
好的好的  对不起  对不起
All right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,160
听说今晚的事没有  
You heard something about tonight?

280
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,320
不  没有  什么都没听到
No, no. I haven't heard anything.

281
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,760
-那你刚才说的是什么  -这个只是...
- What are you talking about then? - Well, it's just....

282
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,470
-继续继续  -我有种预感就是在今晚
- Go on, go on. - I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

283
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,160
-如此而已  -预感　　
- That's all. - A feeling.

284
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,670
带着你的预感去别处吧
Take your feeling somewhere else.

285
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,610
我得写封信
I've got a letter to write.

286
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,510
我从早上起来时就有这种预感
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

287
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,870
整天都有这种感觉
I've had it with me all day long.

288
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,350
无法摆脱它
I can't shake it off.

289
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,220
就是今晚  我知道这一点
It's tonight. I know it is.

290
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,220
好吧  就是今晚
All right, it's tonight.

291
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
正合我意
Suits me fine.

292
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,870
今晚  今天下午  现在
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

293
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,260
我是说  
I mean...

294
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,170
在我喝完啤酒之后
...as soon as I finish this beer.

295
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,160
-将军你现在有空吗  -进来吧　　　　　　
- General, can you spare me a minute? - Come in.

296
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,090
-谢谢  -要咖啡吗
- Thank you. - Can I get you coffee?

297
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,560
-不用谢谢  -我可得来点
- No, thanks. - I'll get some for myself.

298
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,960
美军第八十二空降师副师长  詹姆斯・M・加文准将

299
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,810
还在下雨吗  
Is it still raining?

300
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,610
下下停停  停停下下
On and off, off and on.

301
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440
有时我想知道上帝究竟站在哪一边
Sometimes I wonder which side God's on.

302
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,710
什么  
What?

303
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,350
我说  有时我想知道上帝站在哪一边
I say, sometimes I wonder which side God's on.

304
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,850
好问题
Good question.

305
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,590
你有何想法  范  
What's on your mind, Van?

306
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,860
我担心我们降落地点的安排
I'm concerned about the placement of our drop zones.

307
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,330
继续说
Go on.

308
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,130
我知道现在提出新方案太晚了点  
I know this is a hell of a late date to bring up something new...

309
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,670
但你给我出了个难题
...but you've given me a tough nut to crack.

310
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,440
-我越想越觉得棘手  -我知道范　　　　
- It gets tougher every time I try. - I know, Van.

311
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,280
圣米尔伊格里斯座落在德军唯一能用来...
Sainte- Mere- Eglise straddles the only road the Germans can use...

312
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,910
打入我军北翼的公路上  我们必须拿下
...to drive into our northern flank. But it has to be taken.

313
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,280
而且必须守住
And it has to be held.

314
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,120
所以我才要你去  范
That's why I gave you the job, Van.

315
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,900
-能用下黑板吗  -当然　　　　　
- Can I use your board? - Of course.

316
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,910
这是那个镇  有重兵把守
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

317
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,540
这是沼泽地  德军已经引水淹没
Down here is the swamp area that the Germans have flooded.

318
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,510
这二者中间  距小镇四英里处是我们的着陆点
And in between, four miles from the town, is our drop zone.

319
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,320
如果出了差错而提前着陆  
Now, if anything goes wrong and we undershoot...

320
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,410
降落在沼泽地就会陷入困境
...we land in this flooded area and are bogged down.

321
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,890
如果飞过头了  就会象泥鸽一样落下  
If we overshoot, we come down like clay pigeons...

322
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,060
直接面对来自小镇的火力
...smack dab in the center of Sainte- Mere- Eglise.

323
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,830
所以我在附近的村子训练士兵低空跳伞
That's why I gave the men training in low- level jumps near the villages.

324
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,630
我听说了
So I've heard.

325
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,540
我收到了来自贝克斯荷市议会的投诉
Got a complaint from the city council at Bexhall.

326
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,380
你的一些部下因飞过头而降落在市区
Some of your men overshot the drop zone and landed in the town.

327
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,380
-阻碍交通达一小时  -没错头我也在那　
- Tied up traffic for an hour. - That's true, sir. I was with them.

328
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,490
遭遇侧风  将我们吹过了树梢  
Sudden crosswind hit us, swept us over the treetops...

329
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,760
大家都给吹散了
...scattered us all over the place.

330
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,390
-你落在了哪  -落在一家女修道院的院子里
- Where did you end up? - In the courtyard of a convent.

331
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,400
放松点  范  坐吧
Relax, Van. Sit down.

332
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,740
几个月来我们都吃尽了苦头
The last few months have been a tough grind on all of us.

333
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,620
我听说你和你的部下一直在刻苦训练
I hear you've been working yourself and your battalion hard.

334
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,880
几乎没停过
Almost without a stop.

335
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,090
现在我们就要开始行动了  
Now that we're almost at the end of the line...

336
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,600
你干嘛不让自己和部下放松一下
...why don't you try easing up on yourself and on the men?

337
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,660
偶尔放松一下能让部队的状态更好
Sometimes a battalion can be sharpened to too fine a point.

338
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,960
有时指挥官也一样
Sometimes a commander can too.

339
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,400
好吧
Well...

340
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,440
如果行动继续延后的话
...if there's any further delay...

341
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,420
我请求允许重新安排降落地点
...I request permission to submit a new placement for our drop zones.

342
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,780
行  写个报告吧
All right. Put it in writing.

343
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,360
搞正式一点  这是你的职权
Make it official. That's your prerogative.

344
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,090
萨维克大楼  -盟军海军司令部  位于朴次茅斯城外

345
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,090
不过艾克今晚要在萨维克大楼召开一个决议会
But Ike has called a final meeting for tonight at Southwick House.

346
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,200
如果通过了  今晚九点三十就要出发
If it's on, we'll get the green light by 9:30.

347
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,200
-可能性有多大  -超过五成　　　
- What are the chances? - Better than 50- 50.

348
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,430
当我什么也没说  将军  我有这个师最好的一个营  
Forget everything I said. I got the best battalion in this division...

349
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,880
而且已准备就绪
...and they're ready.

350
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,880
英国皇家空军首席气象顾问  J・N・斯塔格空军上校

351
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,900
来了  最新的报告
Here it is. The latest report.

352
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,510
-萨维克大楼[盟军海军司令部]打来的长官  -我是斯塔格　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
- It's Southwick House, sir. - Stagg here.

353
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,550
是的  长官  新锋的移动比预期的要快
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in much faster than we thought.

354
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,900
是的  很明显有所改善
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.

355
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,700
我会到的  长官  九点三十
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.

356
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,880
-还要茶吗长官  -咖啡吧浓一点　
- Would you like some more tea, sir? - Coffee, and make it black.

357
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,140
谢谢
Please.

358
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,450
等等  普里勒中校
One moment, Colonel Priller.

359
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,350
他为什么没受军法处治  
Why wasn't he court- martialed?

360
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,510
他打下了一百三十二架飞机
He shot down 132 planes.

361
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,290
德国空军西线总部  沃尔夫冈・海格空军中将

362
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,290
你好"匹普斯"老伙计
Hello, Pips, old boy.

363
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,460
别叫我"匹普斯"老伙计
Don't call me"Pips, old boy."

364
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:32,460
共击落一百零一架飞机  其中四引擎轰炸机十一架

365
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,120
我们在苏联时你就是个糟糕的飞行员
You were a rotten pilot when we flew in Russia.

366
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,900
你现在升官了  可仍然是糟糕的飞行员
You're flying a desk now, but you're still a rotten pilot!

367
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,180
你这是什么话  
What's that you're saying?

368
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,670
我窝在这样一个见鬼的机场  
I'm squatting here on this God- forsaken airfield...

369
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,380
就两架飞机  纯粹是两堆破烂
...with only two planes, two stinking crates!

370
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,430
当然  你的命令倒是生效了
Oh, sure, sure, your orders were followed!

371
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,930
可我的中队天知道在哪
Now my squadrons are God- knows- where!

372
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,560
给养早就没了  我现在该做什么  
My supplies are all gone. What am I supposed to do now?

373
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:07,970
但是"匹普斯"我们必须分散飞行中队  必须
But Pips, we had to disperse our fighter squadrons. We had to!

374
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,500
看看我们加莱附近的机场遭受了什么
Look what happened to our airstrips around the Pas- de- Calais!

375
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,550
这种主意真是愚蠢之极
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

376
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,950
你不让我们前进反而让我们后退
You move us back instead of forward!

377
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,120
当然  我知道天气恶劣  所以他们不一定会进攻  
Sure, I know the weather's lousy and they probably won't invade...

378
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,460
但万一他们进攻该怎么办  
...but what would happen if they did?

379
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,830
你该了解以我的装备至少要两天才能赶到
But you know I can't get there with my equipment for two days.

380
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,700
老实说  你们全都疯了
I tell you, you're all crazy!

381
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,320
普里勒总是这么急躁  
Priller has always been a hothead...

382
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,330
但不要因此而轻视他
...but let's not underestimate him.

383
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,070
他的话不无道理
What he says is not entirely illogical.

384
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,840
天气报告怎么说  
What's the weather report?

385
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,370
整个海峡稍有好转
Slightly better over the Channel.

386
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,540
我想不会有意外即使...
I wouldn't be surprised if- -

387
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,140
-下次天气报告什么时候到  -今晚八点将军　　　　　　
- When's the next weather report? - Tonight at 8, general.

388
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,610
随时向我报告天气情况
Keep me posted on the weather.

389
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,720
替我订好晚餐座位没有  
You made my dinner reservations?

390
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,730
订好了  将军
Yes, I did, general.

391
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,630
全部取消
Cancel everything.

392
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,380
-拿了没有  -拿了长官　
- Have you got them? - Yes, sir.

393
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,640
给我
Let me have them.

394
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,480
是送给我太太的鞋  特地在巴黎订做的  
Shoes for my wife, I had them specially made in Paris...

395
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,580
为她庆祝生日  就是明天  六月六号
...for her birthday, tomorrow, the sixth of June.

396
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,190
代我祝她生日快乐
Please wish her a happy birthday.

397
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,860
谢谢  斯派达尔
Thank you, Speidel.

398
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,460
他们干嘛不在五月进攻  那么理想的天气  
Why didn't they attack in May? The weather was perfect....

399
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,070
潮汐都很正常  可现在  
Tides were right, and now....

400
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,510
现在进攻就变得艰难了
An attack now would be embarrassing.

401
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,010
开车  但我们用不着担心
Let's go. But I don't think we need worry.

402
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
德军西线B集团军群参谋长  汉斯・斯派达尔博士少将

403
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,010
积极参与推翻希特勒密谋活动并牵连到隆美尔

404
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,010
战后  于1957年出任北约地面部队总司令

405
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,500
德军第七集团军第八十四军军长  埃里奇・马克斯中将

406
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,040
计划准备好了吗  长官  
Is the plan ready, sir?

407
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,900
是的  计划好了
Yes, yes, quite finished.

408
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,080
战棋推演  
War games...

409
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,960
理论性的入侵
...theoretical invasions.

410
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:56,960
赶去雷恩只是为了在沙盘上插些小旗罢了
Rush to Rennes just to push little flags around a table.

411
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,830
战争中的游戏
Playing at war!

412
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,270
您是赢是输  长官  
Do you win or lose, sir?

413
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,100
我输过吗  
Have I ever lost?

414
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,880
但是将军  这次您扮演的是艾森豪威尔
But general, this time you play the role of Eisenhower.

415
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,890
我赢是因为我不会依常规行事
I win because I go against the rules.

416
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,690
预料中敌人将从海峡最窄之处渡海  
We expect them to cross at the narrowest part of the Channel...

417
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,790
而且是在好天气  但过于显而易见
...and in good weather. But that's too simple, too obvious.

418
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,110
我选的是最宽之处  在最恶劣的天气  进攻此地
I choose the widest part, in the worst weather, and attack here.

419
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,670
诺曼底
In Normandy.

420
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,710
在恶劣天气之中
And in bad weather!

421
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,320
例如现在  
Like now...

422
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,290
这种坏天气
...bad weather!

423
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,920
要作出判断很困难
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

424
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,360
从气象角度来说  目前的情形简直象是寒冬
From a meteorological standpoint, conditions almost resemble mid- winter.

425
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,770
至于诺曼底
And Normandy?

426
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,570
强风  云层  以及雾气笼罩着整个海滩
High winds, clouds, and some fog over the beaches.

427
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,900
不管怎样  我能完全肯定的是  
However, I can say with a certain degree of safety...

428
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,380
将有一段短时间的好天气
...that we can expect a brief period of fair conditions.

429
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,610
那么换而言之
Let me summarize, then.

430
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,010
你能保证的就是将有一段极为短暂的好天气
What you're promising us is a barely tolerable period of fair conditions.

431
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,350
是不是这样  
Am I right?

432
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,690
是的
Yes.

433
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,530
这样的条件远远低于最低要求
Conditions that are far below the minimum requirements.

434
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,160
我只能保证这些
That's all I can promise.

435
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,760
你尽力了  斯塔格  谢谢
You've done your best, Stagg. Thank you, gentlemen.

436
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,550
那么  情况就是  
Well, there it is.

437
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,280
我们已将进攻推迟过一次
We've postponed the attack once already.

438
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,950
现在  要么趁六号的最低条件发动进攻  
Now, either we go on the sixth, with only marginal conditions...

439
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,760
要么再次延后  
...or postpone again...

440
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,690
等待理想的气候条件
...in the hope of getting perfect conditions.

441
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,590
你觉得怎样  蒙蒂  
What do you think, Monty?

442
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,900
我选择进攻  进攻
I say, go. Go.

443
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,400
我必须提醒各位  
I must remind everybody...

444
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,500
负责进攻"奥马哈海滩"和"犹他海滩"的美军船队  
...that the American convoy for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

445
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,610
行程最远  
...they've farthest to go...

446
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,110
必须在半小时以内向他们下令  
...must be given the order within the next half- hour...

447
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,480
如果突袭安排在六号的话
...if the assault is to take place on the sixth.

448
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,620
我们不能让将近二十五万人一直呆在船上  
We can't keep almost a quarter of a million men on ships...

449
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,820
无限期地待命
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.

450
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,160
我们等得越久  安全隐患就越多
The longer we wait, the more acute our security problem.

451
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,130
下一次  
The next time...

452
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,870
潮汐和月亮的正常出现  
...the tides and the moon will be right....

453
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,740
七月以前不会有
Not before July.

454
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,680
各位  
Gentlemen...

455
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,610
延后如此之久  
...such a postponement...

456
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,020
是非常痛苦的选择
...is too bitter to contemplate.

457
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,960
绝妙的计划  将军  不合常规  但堪称绝妙
A brilliant plan, general. Unorthodox, but brilliant.

458
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,170
好在这只是游戏
Fortunately, it's only a game.

459
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,570
我觉得不用太担心
I don't think we have much to worry about.

460
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,580
艾森豪威尔从来不敢冒险
Eisenhower would never take the gamble.

461
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,790
从来不
Never.

462
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,890
我十分肯定应该下令行动
I'm quite positive we must give the order.

463
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,860
尽管不愿意  
I don't like it...

464
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,960
但只能这样
...but there it is.

465
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,770
各位  
Gentlemen...

466
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,740
除了行动我看不出有其他选择
...I don't see how we can possibly do anything else but go.

467
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,230
我是威尔逊
Wilson speaking.

468
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,340
是  长官
Yes, sir.

469
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,840
定了  是艾克下的决定  今晚  按计划行动
It's on, sir. Ike's made the decision. Tonight, as scheduled!

470
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,490
我是汤姆森上校
Colonel Tomson speaking.

471
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,630
谢谢
Thank you.

472
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,970
下一站  
Next stop...

473
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,730
诺曼底
...Normandy.

474
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,740
上帝保佑
God help us now.

475
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,620
英国第一特种突击旅  拉瓦特勋爵

476
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,090
我是拉瓦特
Lovat here.

477
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,670
各位  
Gentlemen...

478
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,290
我们等待的日子终于来了
...the day we've been waiting for has arrived.

479
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,400
进攻  我们出发
Invasion! We're on our way.

480
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,090
将军
General.

481
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,610
美军第四步兵师师长  雷蒙德・巴顿少将

482
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,820
收到命令了  行动
The orders have been given. It's on.

483
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,800
召集指挥官到军官室开会
Have the battalion commanders join me in the wardroom.

484
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,740
行了  中士
All right, sergeant.

485
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,810
你们是我们空降师的眼睛
You men are the eyes of our airborne Army.

486
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,980
作为伞兵引导员  你们只有一个任务
You, the pathfinders, will have one job, and one job only:

487
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,990
为伞兵部队指明降落地点
To light the drop zones for our paratroops.

488
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,960
加上英国人和加拿大人  你们将是  
Along with the British and Canadians you'll be the first men...

489
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,000
第一批登陆法国的人  记住
...to land in France. And remember this:

490
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
到达诺曼底之后  
When you get to Normandy...

491
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,600
你们将只有一个朋友
...you'll only have one friend:

492
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,540
上帝
God.

493
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,510
还有这个
And this.

494
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,180
这个  
This...

495
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,480
是鲁珀特
...is Rupert.

496
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,290
现在  我们要将鲁珀特  
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...

497
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,360
和很多类似他的同伴  
...and a lot more like him...

498
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,590
空投至敌军后方
...behind the invasion area.

499
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,260
他  
He's...

500
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,500
是个非常特别的同伴  鲁珀特
...a very extraordinary fellow, Rupert.

501
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,370
他可以说是  
He's a sort of...

502
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,040
一支单兵部队
...one- man army, all by himself.

503
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,310
让我做给你们看
Let me show you.

504
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:40,350
让你们看看鲁珀特着陆后会发生什么事
Let me show you what happens when Rupert... ...hits the ground.

505
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,590
中士  请把灯关掉
Sergeant, switch off the lights, please.

506
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,390
好了  中士  行了
All right, sergeant, that's all.

507
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,140
好的  够了  镇静
All right, come on. Simmer down.

508
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,570
行了  起来吧
Come on, up.

509
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,040
鲁珀特和他的弟兄可以对德国人做同样的事
It's possible that Rupert and his men will do the same thing to the Germans.

510
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,180
迷惑他们  让他们担心后方  
Confuse them, make them look over their shoulders...

511
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,980
向错误的方向发起攻击
...and launch an attack in the wrong direction.

512
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,100
立正
Ten- hut!

513
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,640
-"蟋蟀"已经分发下去  -我听到了　　　　　　
- The crickets have been distributed. - So I heard.

514
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,980
稍息
At ease!

515
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,220
大家已经作好了准备
You're as ready as we can make you.

516
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,820
这个五分钱的玩具  
This five- cent toy...

517
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,850
不是为了让你们发笑
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

518
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,020
它也许能保住你的命
It may save your life.

519
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,800
你们将在黑暗中着陆
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

520
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:55,860
在篱笆背面的人未必和你穿着相同的制服  所以  
On the other side of that hedgerow the fellow may not be wearing the same uniform you are. So...

521
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,700
一声"咔嗒"
...one click...

522
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,610
要以两声"咔嗒"作为回应
...is to be answered by two clicks.

523
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,180
如果你没收到回应  
And if you don't get that answering click...

524
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,750
趴下  然后开火
...hit the dirt and open fire.

525
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,010
重复一次
I repeat:

526
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,060
一声"咔嗒"
One click...

527
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,520
必须以两声"咔嗒"作为回应
...must be answered by two clicks.

528
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,490
现在  保管好这玩意  它和你的武器一样重要
Now, hang on to this gimmick.It's as important as your weapon.

529
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,600
-听懂没有  -清楚明了头
- Do you read me? - Loud and clear, sir.

530
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,030
很好  另外要说的是
All right. One more thing.

531
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,870
你们今晚的任务很关键
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

532
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,040
不能给敌人以喘息之机
You can't give the enemy a break.

533
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,180
送他们去地狱
Send them to hell.

534

00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,260
我昨晚说过  是给法国抵抗组织的暗号
As I said last night, they're code messages to the Resistance chaps.

552
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,420
显然  信息对这个组织是这个意思  
Obviously, one message means something to one group...

553
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,000

You know, I'm too old a bunny to get very excited about all this.

581
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,560
我该出什么  哦  黑桃二

真是难以置信
It's almost impossible to believe.

583
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,260
每个点代表一艘船
Every dot represents a ship.

584
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,540
有战舰  巡洋舰  驱逐舰  扫雷艇
You got battlewagons, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers.

我们死后人们仍将谈论很长时间
...that people will talk about long after we're dead and gone.

592
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,880
想知道一件事吗  
You wanna know something?

593
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:37,750
单是参与其中就令我坐立不安
It gives me goose pimples just to be part of it.

594

598
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,620
她也是  我们不单是为了找刺激
And so did she. We didn't do it just for kicks.

Two weeks.

601
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,960
也许我不该在信中那样写
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.

602
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,030
我是说  她是个高级模特  而我  
I mean, she's a high- class model and all, and l....

603
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,870
我不是那种随随便便就结婚的人
I'm not the kind of guy to get married that easy.

604
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,170
不会拿这种事当儿戏
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.

605
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,020
不过伙计  我们真的有过一段美好时光
But oh, man, we really had some wonderful times together.

606
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,860
你觉得她找了个男朋友  
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

607
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,830
她从没真正说起过  
Well, she never actually said so....

608
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,770
我是说  
I mean....

609
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,870
我这样对吗  我是说  公平吗  
You think I was right? I mean, was I fair?

610
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,070
没你的允许她不能找别人不是吗  
She can't get one without your permission, right?

611
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:57,150
必须要你同意
You gotta give your okay.

612
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,940
我知道这是法律
I know it's the law.

613
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,020
它们是为军婚而制订的
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

614

615
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,660
祝你好运
Good luck.

616

那家伙是谁  你和他聊了这么久  
Who was that guy? The one you was talking to so long?

我不认识"麻雀"

准备切蛋糕吗  长官  
Will you cut the cake, sir?

623
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,010
我相信你们不会希望我吃太多

624
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:35,320
一九四四年六月六日  圣洛・诺曼底

626
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,080
笨蛋  那是表示胜利的信号  三短一长
Dummkopf, that's the"V for victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.

The Orne River Bridge must be captured... ...before the enemy can destroy it.

It's a vital military artery, and the enemy has prepared it for demolition.

Your gliders will land at night, without the benefit of ground support.

00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,500
我们落在了河里  只怕伤亡惨重
We crashed in the river. Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

671
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,130
我没事  头  弟兄们一样
I'm all right, sir. So are the boys.

672
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,710
-好继续行动  -好的头跟我来
- Okay, carry on. - Right, sir. Come on!

673
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,470
我真要  
Well, I'll be....

674
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,600
嘿  医生  医生
Hey, doc! Doc!

675
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,980
你在那干嘛  那边是德国人
What are you doing there? That's the German side.

676
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,140
长官  谁都可能犯错
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.

677
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:03,990
头  
Sir?

678
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,430
爆破装置已拆除  彻底安全了
The demolition charges have been removed. It's all clear.

679
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,440
很好  史密斯下士
Good. Corporal Smith.

680
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:15,030
发送成功信号  直到收到确认信号
Send out the success code words. Keep sending until acknowledged.

681
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,150
-约翰在碉堡设立指挥部  -好的头　　　　　　　
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox. - Right, sir.

682
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,320
不到十五分钟就搞定了
All in less than 15 minutes.

683
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,900
他们的反攻只是时间问题
Only a matter of time before they counterattack.

684
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:37,170
-伞兵呢  -第七伞兵营恐怕要数小时后才到
- What about the paratroopers? - 7th Para might not get here for hours.

685
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,630
拉瓦特和他的突击队  
And Lovat and his commandos....

686
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,930
可能要午后才能到
It could be midday before they get here.

687
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,700
问题就是我们能守多久了
The question is, how long can we hold?

688
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,310
守至援军到来
Hold until relieved.

689
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,190
守至援军到来
Hold until relieved.

690
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,750
德军第七集团军参谋长  麦克斯・彭塞尔少将

691
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:04,400
天气真糟  又下雨了
What awful weather. It's raining again.

692
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,290
德军第七集团军指挥部

693
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,100
谢谢
Thank you.

694
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,400
拿到名单了吗  
Did you get the list?

695
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:17,540
七○九师师长卡尔・冯・施莱本中将已前往参加战棋推演
General Schlieben of the 709th has already left for the war games.

696

二四三师师长海因茨・赫尔密奇中将也于晚上六点去了雷恩
The commander of the 243rd left for Rennes at 1800 hours.

697
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:25,050
还有呢  
Who else?

698
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,760
还有三五二师的齐默曼  总共十二名军官
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd, 12 officers in all.

699
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,890
是啊  我知道
Yes, I know.

700
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:36,960
天气不好  所以全都想在雷恩多享受一晚
The weather is bad, so everyone enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

701
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,770
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

702
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,380
一点都不
Any of it.

703
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,780
这么多重要军官同时不在
So many key officers are away at the same time.

704
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,140
不知道为什么  但我就是不喜欢
I don't know why, but I don't like it.

705
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,520
但战棋推演一周前就定好了日期  
But the war games have been scheduled for a week....

706
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,520
对  是明天  不是今晚
Yes, for tomorrow, not tonight.

707
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,590
建议所有尚未前往雷恩的军官  
Advise all officers who have not yet left for Rennes...

708
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,790
推迟行程  到明天再说
...to postpone their departure until tomorrow.

709
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:07,840
容我提醒您  将军  
May I remind you, general...

710
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:11,810
盟军向来是在理想的天气条件下才登陆
...that the Allies have always landed in perfect weather conditions.

711
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,080
北非  西西里  意大利  
North Africa, Sicily, ltaly....

712
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,310
对  总是在黎明时分
Yes, and always at dawn.

713
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,800
我们还有十一分钟就要跳伞
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

714
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,200
现在  我再重复一次
Now, once more, I repeat:

715
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,200
如果意外降落到错误的地点  
If, for any reason, we fail to hit our drop zones...

716
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,310
就朝东北方向前进
...move north by east.

717
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,440
东北方向
North by east.

718
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,470
德军已经淹没了海岸后方的大面积沼泽地
The Germans have flooded large swamp areas behind the coast.

719
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,850
尽量避开那
Avoid them if possible.

720
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,950
我们是来打仗  不是来游泳
We came here to fight, not to swim.

721
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,790
听清楚没有  
Do you read me?

722
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,290
听清楚了  长官
Loud and clear, sir.

723
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,880
结果如何  
How'd you make out?

724
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:19,750
你加入赌局的结果如何  
How did you make out at the game?

725
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,990
输了
I lost.

726
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
现在我们都能安全着陆了
Now we're both jumping clean.

727
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,950
我明白  元帅将于何时返回  
I understand. And when will the field marshal return?

728
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,690
知道了
I see. Oh, well.

729
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,300
等一下
Just a moment.

730
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,690
雷达报告
The radar report.

731
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,700
我们收到报告说雷达受到强烈干扰  
We are getting reports of strong radar interference...

732
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,580
无线电接收也有阻碍
...and radio reception is jammed.

733
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:15,070
我知道以前也有过  但从未如此严重
I realize this has happened before, but never this effectively!

734
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,050
而且  
And the

735
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,590
打给西线统帅部  好吧
Call the OB West? Very well.

736
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,690
元帅返回后代我问候他
Give my respects to the field marshal when he returns.

737
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,860
卡昂  凌晨一时○七分

738
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:02,260
再见  鲁珀特  为上帝  国王  和你的国家效力吧
Bye, Rupert. Do your duty for God, king, and your country.

739
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,340
请求增援  我们遭到攻击
Call for reinforcements! We're under attack!

740
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,680
往前走  上火车  快
Forward! Board! Fast!

741
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,570
-我们来晚了吗  -不不过...
- Are we late? - No, but...

742
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,340
我们得赶快
...we must hurry!

743
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,460
怎么了  
What is it?

744
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,330
我去
I'll go.

745
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:19,190
站住
Stop!

746
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:21,590
我说站住
We said, stop!

747
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,990
站住  不然开枪了
Stop, or I'll shoot!

748
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:30,100
你在这干什么  
What are you doing here?

749
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,000
我住在那个村子里
I live in that farm.

750
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,640
那个村子没人住
Nobody lives in that farm.

751
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,610
-是空的  -出示你的证件
- It's abandoned. - Show me your papers.

752
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,610
快点
Hurry up!

753
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,460
跟我走
Come with me.

754
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,130
快点
Go on!

755
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,700
把脚踏车放在那
Put your bicycle there.

756
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,840
汉斯
Hans!

757
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,810
汉斯  你在哪  
Hans, where are you?

758
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,320
-是怎么回事  -没什么事　　
- What's going on here? - Nothing!

759
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:46,350
有谁和你一起  快说
Who is with you? I want to know!

760
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,000
停下
Stop!

761
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,740
停下
Stop!

762
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:12,850
停下
Stop!

763
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,590
停下  停下
Stop! Stop!

764
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:11,450
祝你在战棋推演中取胜  将军
Good luck at the war games, general.

765
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,920
有重要消息吗  
Anything important?

766
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,980
通信兵报告说很难和前方取得联系
Communications reports difficulty in contacting our forward posts.

767
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,320
又是地下组织
The Underground again!

768
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:28,600
有一些用降落伞空降的橡胶假人
Some sort of rubber dummies have been dropped by parachute.

769
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,670
橡胶假人
Rubber dummies!

770
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:34,470
给我接里克特将军
Connect me with General Richter!

771
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:39,710
我们早料到将会有突袭  和其他牵制性行动  
We can expect commando raids and other diversionary tactics...

772
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:45,220
但我不喜欢假人伞兵这种主意
...but I don't like this idea of dummy parachutists.

773
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,960
我是马克斯  对
Marcks speaking. Yes.

774
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,830
你肯定  
Are you certain?

775
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,460
有多少  
How many?

776
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,630
你有什么看法  
What do you think of it?

777
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,710
谢谢  里克特
Thank you, Richter.

778
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,140
报告说发现伞兵  这  这  还有这
Paratroopers reported here, here and here!

779
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,690
放在那
Put it over there.

780
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:23,400
这就是空降的假人  碰到地面就会爆炸
This is what they dropped, they explode on contact with the earth.

781
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,160
在黑暗中看起来就象士兵
In the dark, they look like soldiers.

782
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:31,640
也许里克特将军看到的就是这个  而不是真的伞兵
Perhaps these are what General Richter saw, not real paratroopers.

783
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,890
当你组织一次佯攻时  总会有某种目的
When you create a diversion, it's for a reason.

784
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,900
替我接彭塞尔将军
Connect me with General Pemsel!

785
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:54,400
假人  
Dummies...?!

786
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,530
橡胶假人
Rubber dummies!

787
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:03,410
我同意你的看法  将军  我会再打给你
I agree with you, general. I'll call you back.

788
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,650
接通冯・龙德施泰特没有  
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

789
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,620
无法取得联络  主干线似乎被切断了
We haven't been able to reach him. The main lines seem to be cut.

790
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:13,220
正在尝试其他联络方式
Colonel Helmdach is trying to re- route the call.

791
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,130
他们投下假人  
They wouldn't drop dummies...

792
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,220
肯定是想转移我们的注意力
...unless it was to divert our attention from something else.

793
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,930
在这种天气  
In this weather?

794
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,730
什么天气都一样
In any kind of weather!

795
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:26,930
我必须联络西线统帅部
I must get in touch with OB West.

796
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,100
他们是敌人的伞兵
They're enemy paratroopers!

797
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,210
见鬼  伙计  
Blimey, mate...

798
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,520
你们会吵醒所有可恶的德国兵
...you'll wake up the whole blooming German Army!

799
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:21,800
伙计们
Fellas!

800
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,770
我被挂住了
I'm hung up!

801
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,500
伙计们
Fellas!

802
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:39,390
-你没事吧  -没事　　　
- Are you all right? - Yeah.

803
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:19,530
你们是从哪来的  
Where have you come from?

804
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,400
非常抱歉  老头
Awfully sorry, old man.

805
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,840
我们在这儿着陆的只能算是阴错阳差
Simply landed here by accident.

806
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:33,880
是谁  
What's that?

807
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,750
抱歉吓到你了  我在找我的圣餐餐具
Sorry I startled you. I'm trying to find my communion set.

808
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,380
-你的什么  -圣餐餐具我把它弄丢了
- Your what? - My communion set. I've lost it.

809
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:44,530
听着神父我们没时间来找...
Now listen, padre. We've got no time to look for- -

810
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,440
我肯定是在这弄丢的
I'm sure that it was here that I lost it.

811
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,760
我们处在火力之中神父你不觉得应该...
We're under fire, padre. Don't you think we ought to- - ?

812
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:20,630
你走吧  我的孩子  走  我很快就能找到
You go on, my boy. Go on. I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

813
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,970
老天  真是没办法
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

814
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,250
我找到了  我找到了
I've got it! I've got it!

815
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,250
太好了
Glory be.

816
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:37,280
现在  我的孩子  我们去完成上帝的使命
Now, my son, let's go about God's work this night.

817
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,840
我是普拉斯凯
Pluskat.

818
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,810
奥克中校  德军第三五二海防师

819
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,110
喂  普拉斯凯  能听到吗  
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?

820
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,350
我什么都没听到  
Nothing that I've heard....

821
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,320
是经常有的爆炸声  但相当远
The usual bombing, but quite distant.

822
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,760
是的  我听到了
Oh, yes, I can hear it.

823
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,730
等一下
Well, wait a minute.

824
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:17,870
是的  稍等一下
Yes, just a moment.

825
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:35,980
有闪光  但离海岸很远
Flares, but a long way up the coast.

826
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,550
是的  瑟堡又遭到了攻击
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.

827
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,630
也许没什么事  
There's probably nothing to it...

828
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,900
但是收到报告说有伞兵降落
...but we have had reports of paratrooper landings.

829
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:51,170
我去工事上看看
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

830
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,610
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

831
01:17:56,020 --> 01:18:02,740
圣米尔伊格里斯  凌晨二时○三分

832
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:14,160
高一点  高一点
Higher! Higher!

833
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,330
路易斯  打开你的店门  我们还要些桶子
Louis, open your store. We need more buckets!

834
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:30,250
雷诺镇长  你得马上跟我来
Mayor Renaud, you must come with me immediately.

835
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:33,850

- Is it important? - Very important, Mayor Renaud.

836
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:45,460
怎么了  夫人  
What's wrong, madam?

837
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,230
我在去外边小屋的路上  
I was on my way to the little house outside....

838
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,910
好的  继续说
Yes, yes, go on.

839
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:52,030
突然看到有个人从天而降
Suddenly, I saw a man fall from the sky.

840
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,180
-伞兵  -是的一点没错
- A parachutist? - Yes, that's right.

841
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,010
看起来就象只白色大鸟
He looked like a big white bird!

842
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,340
-英国人还是德国人  -什么　　　　　
- British or German? - What?

843
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,950
那个伞兵是朋友还是敌人  
The parachutist, was he a friend or an enemy?

844
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:04,820
我不知道  他只说"嘘"然后就不见了
I don't know. He disappeared without a word. Just"Shh!"

845
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,360
-什么都没说  -只说"嘘"
- Without a word? - Just"Shh!"

846
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,230
早  女士
Bonjour, madame...

847
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,530

850
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,320
我们似乎在兜圈子
We seem to be circling.

851
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:32,320
没准他们找不到降落地点了
Maybe they're having difficulty finding the drop zone.

852
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:34,820
天杀的  
Je suis...

853

01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,310
伞兵
Paratroopers!

862
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:34,390
伞兵部队  伞兵部队
Paratroop groups.Those are paratroop groups!

863
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,310
有没有新消息  
Anything new?

864
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:52,540
瑟堡那边和平时一样爆炸声不断  
Heavy bombing over Cherbourg as usual, sir...

865
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,220
现在接近卡昂了
...and now near Caen.

866
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,150
第六和第八号炮位的线路被切断  
The lines to Stations 6 and 8 have been cut...

867
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,490
但指挥线路还能接通
...but the direct line is open.

868
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,680
我在这呆会儿
I'll stay for a while.

869
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,450
-要咖啡吗  -好的谢谢　
- Would you like coffee? - Yes, thank you.

870
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,700
看在上帝份上  神父  别再弄出声音
For God's sakes, padre, stop that damn noise.

871
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:12,530
抱歉  孩子  我恐怕迷路了
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

872
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,400
有谁不怕  跟我来
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.

873
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:09,960
两声"咔嗒"
Two clicks.

874
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:12,370
我听到是两声"咔嗒"
I heard two clicks.

875
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,720
老兄  
Man...

876

很高兴见到你们

877
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:00,650
-你们是八十二空降师吗  -不是一○一空降师　　　
- You guys the 82nd? - No. This is the 101.

878
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,230
一○一  
101?

879
01:28:02,430 --> 01:28:03,730
那八十二空降师呢  
Where's the 82nd?

880
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:07,270
伙计  我们也不知道自己的大部队在哪
Look, bud, we don't even know where our own outfit is.

881
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,970
有人在攻击对方
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.

882
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:12,700
我们去看看战况
Let's us go find this war.

883

来吧
Come on.

884
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:47,310
也许是英国佬  他们没有"蟋蟀"
Maybe they're Limeys and ain't got no cricket.

885
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:52,010
肯定是自己人
They must be our guys.

886
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,060
好吧
Okay.

887
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,780
不
No.

888
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:37,600
嘿
Hey.

889
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,340
嘿  他们是德国人
Hey, they were Germans.

890
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:54,990
有数百架飞机从我们两旁飞过
Hundreds of planes have been flying to my left and right.

891
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,860

Now over the Cherbourg peninsula. Something must be happening!

894
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:10,510
什么情况  普拉斯凯  什么情况  我一点都不明白
But what, Pluskat, what? I haven't the faintest idea.

895
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:16,080
海滩上发现什么情况没有  
Has anything been observed on the beaches?

896
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:20,420
不  什么都没有
No, nothing.

897
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,760
好的  我会随时向你报告

898
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:25,360
当然
Of course.

899
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,390
你肯定是踝骨断了  
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

900
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:37,300
复合骨折  头
Compound fracture, sir.

901
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:41,670
把靴子穿回去  系好靴带  系紧
Well, put the boot back on and lace it up, tight.

902
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:43,640
别发火  又不是我弄断的
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.

903
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:45,650
你也不必用它走路
And you're not walking on it.

904
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:50,180
-你不会是想  -别再说了照我说的做
- You're not going to try - Knock it off and do as you're told.

905
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:02,460
什么事  
Yes?

906
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,900
A  B  C连和我们一样全走散了
A, B and C Company are scattered all over like we are.

907
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,470
还有呢
Go on.

908
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,810
康克林少校落在石墙上摔断了肩膀  我把他留给卫生员了
Major Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

909
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,640
联络到F连没有  
Any contact with F Company?

910
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:17,880
没有但他们肯定在前面圣米尔伊格里斯方向
No, but they must be up ahead in the direction of Sainte- Mere- Eglise.

911
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,450
别停下  系好  系好
Well, go ahead. Tie it off. Tie it off.

在沼泽地的北端  
The northern edge of the swamp area...

914

离预定着陆点有五英里

915
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,670
五英里
Five miles.

916
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,570
-是F连吗  -不长官　　
- F Company? - No, sir.

917
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:38,940
我们四处搜索过了
And we've got scouts all over the place.

918
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,170
找到了一○一空降师的一队弟兄
We even picked up a group from the 101.

919
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:45,340
F连是在领航的第一架飞机上
F Company were the first of the lead planes.

920
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,220
扶我一把

921

把我的枪给我
Can I have my rifle?

922
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,840
我们朝这个方向走
Well, we'll head out this way.

923
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,910
天亮时我们应该能到达高地或者开阔地
We ought to reach high ground and open country by daybreak.

924
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,690
好了  让大家分散开来  
All right. Have the men spread out...

925
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,850
沿途召集走散的弟兄
...pick up any stragglers they can find.

926
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,460
-把话传下去  -是长官　　
- Pass the word. - Right, sir.

927
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,650
大家分散开  聚拢掉队的弟兄
All right, men, spread out. Pick up stragglers you see.

928
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:28,530
把话传下去
Pass the word down.

929
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,600
好了  
All right...

我们出发
...Iet's go.

931
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,400
根据最新的报告  我的看法是  
From the latest reports, this is how I see it:

932
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:41,710
美军伞兵已经降落在  
American paratroopers have landed....

933
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,840
这
...here.

934
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,850
英军伞兵在这
British paratroopers here.

935
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,090
将会进攻  
The invasion....

937
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:00,460
是的  谢谢  彭塞尔

彭塞尔将军确信这是入侵

939
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:10,100
我不同意  我的看法是  
I do not agree with him. This is my conclusion:

940
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,740
诺曼底只是牵制性攻击的目标
Normandy is the objective of a diversionary attack.

941
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:16,250
是牵制性攻击  布鲁门特里特
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.

942
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:20,480
不是主要攻击目标主目标是加莱...
It's not the main attack. That will come at the Pas- de- Calais...

943
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,120
早就预料到的地点
...where it was always expected.

944
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:28,600
那是我们预料的地点
Where we always expected it.

945
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,830
但我们不能掉以轻心
But we can't take any chances.

946
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:35,270
立刻出动装甲预备队
I want the reserve panzers moved up at once!

947
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,440
必须经过元首统帅部的同意
We need approval from the Fuhrer's headquarters.

948
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,440
他们不敢拒绝我的要求
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

949
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:46,780
打电话给元首统帅部强调这一点
Call the Fuhrer's headquarters and insist.

950
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:51,480
强调装甲部队要交由我直接指挥
Insist that the panzers be released to me immediately!

951
01:33:56,370 --> 01:34:02,060
进攻诺曼底悖离了军事常规
An invasion of Normandy would be against all military logic.

952
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,200
实在是悖离所有常规
It would really be against all logic.

953
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,030
大概就是这些了  各位
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.

954
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:25,670
你们大部分以前有过登陆经验
Most of you have had your feet wet before:

955
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:28,780
敦克尔克  迪耶普  挪威
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.

956
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:31,880
大家都知道被赶下海是指什么
And we know what it means to be driven into the sea.

957
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:35,050
几小时后我们要从海上杀回去
In a few hours we're going back from the sea.

958
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,890
这次我们要站住脚
And this time we're going to stay.

959
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:44,870
没有时间来为英格兰  家园  以及美女而伤感
There's no time for any sob stuff about England, home and beauty.

960
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,210
记住  我们的同胞已经受苦受难四年半了
Remember, our people have had a rough time for four and a half years.

961
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:53,710
他们应该赢得最后的胜利
They've earned the final victory.

962
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,550
让我们来实现它
Let's give it to them.

963
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,820
对于军中的法国战友  我要说  
And to our French comrades in arms, I say:

964
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,620
祝你们好运
Good luck.

965
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,850
明早  我们要打败他们
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.

966
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,500
请进  泰迪  就这样吧  中士
Come in, Teddy. That will be all, sergeant.

967
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,000
美军第四步兵师副师长  西奥多・罗斯福准将

968
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,140
美军第四步兵师副师长  西奥多・罗斯福准将

969
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:28,930
你一定要写进报告吗  
Did you have to put it in writing?

970
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,630
不这样你就不会让我去
I knew you wouldn't let me go unless I did.

971
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:33,860
你这是给我出难题
You're putting me on the spot.

972
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,660
-我不是有意的塔比  -不是才怪　　　　
- I didn't mean to, Tubby. - The hell you didn't.

973
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,700
你都将请求写进了正式报告
You put that request in writing, made it official.

974
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:42,500
你可是副师长
You're the assistant division commander.

975
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:46,010
所以我应该第一波上岸
And that's why I'm supposed to go ashore in the first wave.

976
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:49,020
我应该去那  你知道的
That's where I'm supposed to be. You know that.

977
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:50,920
你对这次行动很重要
You're important to this operation.

978
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:53,790
我们不能在第一天就失去你
We can't have you knocked off on the first day.

979
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,290
可那不是真正的理由
But that's not the real reason.

980
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:00,130
是不是因为我父亲是美国总统  
Isn't it because my father was president of the United States?

981
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,800
而且是了不起的总统
And a great president.

982
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,800
也是了不起的军人
And a great soldier.

983
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:07,310
他曾带领"铁骑兵"攻下了圣胡安山
He led the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill.

984
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:11,940
所以现在你想成为第一个登上"犹他海滩"的人
So now you've got to be the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

985
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:15,890
可那是我应该去的地方  这是我的职责
But that's where I'm supposed to be, Tubby. That's my job.

986
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,030
而且我和部下一起经历过所有训练
Also, I've been there side by side with the men all through training.

987
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:30,340
他们习惯看到我在场  也有权利期待我在场
They're used to seeing me there. They have a right to expect me there.

988
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:33,170
不管是不是总统的儿子
President's son or not.

989
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,680
我的请求被拒绝了  
Is my request denied?

990
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,990
不  你知道不会的
No, you know it's not.

991
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:57,040
被很不情愿地批准了
Request reluctantly approved.

992
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,600
谢谢  塔比
Thanks, Tubby.

993
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,610
非常感谢
Thanks a lot.

994
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,210
那么  
Say...

995
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,520
你的关节炎怎么样了  
...how's that arthritis of yours?

996
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:10,720
关节炎  
Arthritis?

997
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:13,890
好几个月没发作了
Haven't had a touch in months.

998
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:15,460
真是个好消息
Glad to hear it.

999
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:35,620
街道  
The street...

1000
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:38,230
桥  
...the bridge...

1001
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,530
旅馆  
...the hotel...

1002
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:43,930
赌场
...the casino.

1003
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,280
法军突击队指挥官  菲力普・基佛海军中校

1004
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,740
就是这样  各位
That's it, gentlemen.

1005
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,790
另外  
One more thing....

1006
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,650
四年来你们转战各方  
You have been fighting everywhere for four years...

1007
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,200
阿比西尼亚  利比亚  埃及  克里特岛  
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete....

1008
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:15,330
但这次你们是在法国的领土上作战  
But this time you are going to fight on French soil...

1009
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:17,500
是在我们的土地  
...in our fields...

1010
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:20,100
我们的乡村  
...in our villages...

1011
01:38:22,220 --> 01:38:24,050
我们同胞的眼皮底下
...under the eyes of our own people.

1012
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:29,900
阿尔弗雷德・约德尔陆军上将

1013
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:31,160
我可不能为这自相矛盾的报告叫醒元首
I can't wake the Fuhrer on the strength of contradictory reports.

1014
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:33,160
德国武装部队最高统帅部作战部部长

1015
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:35,090
他吃过镇静剂在睡觉  要四点起床
He was up till four. He took a sedative and then retired.

1016
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,100
我不能为这些报告吵醒他
I won't wake him for these reports.

1017
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:43,170
最初的报告说伞兵是被击落飞机上的机组人员
First we hear that the paratroopers are shot down plane crews.

1018
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,510
然后又被说成是橡胶假人
Next they are identified as mechanical dummies.

1019
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,640
即使报告都是真的而且伞兵已经着陆  
If these reports are true and paratroopers have landed...

1020
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:54,520
也可能只是一次突袭而已
...it can only be a commando raid.

1021
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:59,360
这种理由足以派装甲部队前往海岸吗  
Is that a sufficient reason to send the panzers to the coast?

1022
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,800
元首醒后我会尽快将这些报告提交给他
I will submit all reports to the Fuhrer as soon as he awakens.

1023
01:39:05,810 --> 01:39:07,570
明白了
I understand.

1024
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,410
约德尔拒绝了请求
Jodl has turned us down.

1025
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:18,680
没有元首的批准  他不会将装甲部队交给我们  
He will not release the panzers without the Fuhrer's approval...

1026
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:24,220
而元首还在睡觉
...and the Fuhrer is still asleep!

1027
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,930
要通知冯・龙德施泰特吗  
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

1028
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,930
不  暂时不用  
No, not now....

1029
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:37,110
暂时不用
Not now.

1030
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:40,350
谢谢  各位
Thank you, gentlemen.

1031
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:59,230
坐吧
Sit down.

1032
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,480
这是历史性的
This is history.

1033
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:11,980
我们正处在一个历史性的时刻  我们要输掉这场战争了  
We are living a historical moment. We are going to lose the war...

1034
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:17,020
就因为伟大的元首吃了一颗安眠药  
...because the glorious Fuhrer has taken a sleeping pill...

1035
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:21,090
所以不能被吵醒
...and is not to be awakened.

1036
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:24,270
真是难以置信
It's unbelievable.

1037
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,100
想想这一刻  库尔特
Think of it, Kurt.

1038
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:29,980
永远别忘了这一刻
Don't ever forget it.

1039
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:34,140
我们正在见证一件事  
We are witnessing something...

1040
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:38,520
历史学家会一直说这绝无可能  
...which historians will always say is completely improbable...

1041
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:40,420
但却千真万确
...and yet it is true.

1042
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,990
元首不能被吵醒
The Fuhrer is not to be awakened!

1043
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:51,430
有时我真想知道上帝是站在哪一边
I sometimes wonder whose side God is on.

1044
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:54,400
要我  
Can l...

1045
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,780
为您拿点什么来吗  
...bring you anything, sir?

1046
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:05,220
我房间里有一瓶上等的干邑白兰地  
In my room there is a bottle of excellent cognac...

1047
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,090
"拿破仑"还没开过
...Napoleon, unopened.

1048
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:12,100
我本想留到一个合适的场合再开
I was even saving it for a fitting occasion.

1049
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:17,930
现在算不上合适的场合  可还是拿来再说吧
This isn't exactly the right occasion, but get it anyway.

1050
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,170
总算天亮了
Daylight at last.

1051
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,570
又浪费了一整夜
A whole night wasted again!

1052
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,460
我的狗呢  
Where's my dog?

1053
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,760
刚才还在这呢
He was here a minute ago.

1054
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:09,310
最后再看一下
Let's have one last look.

1055
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,750
什么都没有
Nothing.

1056
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:17,120
连只海鸥都没  
Not even a seagull....

1057
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,170
我的天
My God!

1058
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:36,250
入侵
The invasion.

1059
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,150
他们来了
They're coming!

1060
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:41,610
各就各位
Everyone to your posts!

1061
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:48,050
是入侵  海上至少有五千艘船
It's the invasion! There must be 5000 ships out there!

1062
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:51,150
镇静一点  普拉斯凯
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.

1063
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:56,360
敌军的船只连那一半都不到
The enemy doesn't have even half that many.

1064
01:42:56,740 --> 01:43:00,770
该死的  自己过来看看吧  你这白痴
Well, damn it! Come and see for yourself, you fool!

1065
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:03,410
太惊人了
It's amazing.

1066
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,070
真不敢相信
It's beyond belief.

1067
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:11,050
亲爱的普拉斯凯  那些船在朝哪开  
My dear Pluskat, where are these ships heading?

1068
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,920
冲我这来了
Straight for me!

1069
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,930
美国第一集团军司令  奥马尔・布雷德利中将

1070
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,610
将军  两分钟之后  
General, in exactly two minutes...

1071
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:34,010
舰队就将开火
...the fleet will open fire.

1072
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:38,590
请注意  将军将发表讲话
Your attention, please. The admiral has an announcement.

1073
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:43,040
"自由法国"武装力量　朱雅德海军少将

1074
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:45,830
我们很快将光荣地投身于战斗之中
Soon we will have the honor to be engaged in battle.

1075
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:51,870
为了赶走敌人  我们不得不向自己的领土开火
To drive the enemy out, we must fire on our homeland.

1076
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,940
这是自由的代价
This is the price of liberty.

1077

Do you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's going on?

1083

你一定是聋了  难道  
You must be deaf! Can't you...?

1084
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,200
该死的  难道你没听见吗  
Damn it, can't you hear it for yourself?

1085
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:33,910
我们正遭到攻击  是的  遭到攻击
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!

1086
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:43,860
你说盟军弄不到的那五千艘船  
Those 5000 ships you say the Allies haven't got...

1087

The invasion has started! Put yourself on alert at once!

1092
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,260
就凭两架飞机我能干什么  
What the hell can I do with only two planes?

1093
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:35,020
其他飞机在哪  你这白痴
Where are the others, you idiots?!

普里勒  这是命令  马上准备  明白了吗  
Priller, that's an order! Get ready at once! Understand?

It's getting very difficult to get any sleep around here.

你准备好长眠不醒吧  入侵已经开始了
Your prospects for a long sleep are excellent. The invasion has begun.

1101
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,070

The evil of it all. Drowning a man before he fights.

02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:40,810
那边是德国人  白痴
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!

1211
02:01:41,050 --> 02:01:44,180
是这边  是这边
The other way! The other way!

1212
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:46,120
该死的叛徒
Damned traitors!

1213
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:49,020
-牵着它  -你就不能把你的手指拿出来手吗
- Hold it. - Can't you get your finger out?

1214
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:51,930
-怎么回事  -引擎无法启动长官
- What's the matter? - Engine won't start, sir.

1215
02:01:52,140 --> 02:01:53,760
我想是进了海水
Full of seawater, I think.

1216
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:56,830
我的老祖母经常说  
My old grandmother used to say...

1217
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,740
机械有什么问题就狠狠揍它
...anything mechanical, give it a good bash.

1218
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:02,540
现在试试
Try it now.

1219
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:05,750
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

1220
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:07,480
走吧  祝你们好运
Off you go. Good luck.

1221
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,790
这一下可真有用
I'm sure that got it out.

1222
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:17,930
这就是我说的厉害角色
That's what I call a hell of a man!

1223
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:20,360
我也喜欢他的狗
Aye, I like his dog too.

1224
02:02:21,410 --> 02:02:23,200
别在那废话了
Don't stand there yapping!

1225
02:02:23,410 --> 02:02:26,170
这可不是海德公园  是战场
This isn't Hyde Park Corner! The war's over there!

1226
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:29,780
跟上
Come along!

1227
02:02:29,980 --> 02:02:31,250
快
Come on!

1228
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:35,020
-谢谢  -一切都很顺利
- Thank you. - Everything's going according to plan.

1229
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:38,520
等待行动命令  米林"蓝色无边帽"
Stand by to move. Millin,"Blue Bonnet."

1230
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:51,940
搞什么鬼  
What in God's name...?

1231
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:59,910
我的朋友  多么美好的一天
Oh, my friends. What a day! What a day!

1232
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:02,490
欢迎来到法国  欢迎来到高利维尼苏
Welcome to France. Welcome to Colleville!

1233
02:03:02,730 --> 02:03:04,850
你太好了真是幸会
Most kind of you. Very nice to meet you- -

1234
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:07,260
看  我一直留着这个
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

1235
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:10,270
不过恐怕不够大家喝的
But I don't think there will be enough for everyone.

1236
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:14,570
也许下次吧  我们还另有预约:打仗
Perhaps next time. We have a previous engagement: the war!

1237
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:17,240
不必浪费香槟了
Mustn't lose that champagne!

1238
02:03:17,610 --> 02:03:20,600
好了  大家集合  米林"蓝色无边帽"
All right, men, fall in! Millin,"Blue Bonnet."

1239
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:23,620
再见
Goodbye.

1240
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:28,110
谢谢  小伙子们  谢谢
Thank you, boys! Thank you!

1241
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:36,630
法兰西万岁  盟军万岁
Long live France! Long live the Allies!

1242
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,140
要我说的话  
If you ask me, Flanagan...

1243
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:42,760
这海滩上真有不少古怪的家伙
...there's a lot of very peculiar blokes on this beach.

1244
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,670
欢迎
Welcome!

1245
02:03:46,650 --> 02:03:48,280
欢迎大家
Welcome to you all!

1246
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:43,190
谢谢  亲爱的  这鞋真漂亮
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!

1247
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:47,960
最好先穿上试试
Better try them on first.

1248
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,900
我是隆美尔
Rommel speaking.

1249
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:55,550
早
Good morning.

1250
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,850
什么  
What?

1251
02:05:58,490 --> 02:05:59,850
什么
What!

1252
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:01,920
哪  
Where?

1253
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:03,420
诺曼底
Normandy!

1254
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:06,690
他们已经登陆了吗  
Have they a foothold already?

1255
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,860
必须阻止他们
They must be thrown back!

1256
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:12,560
装甲预备队呢  
What about the panzer reserves?

1257
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:17,030
冯・龙德施泰特从元首那获取指挥权没有  
Did von Rundstedt obtain their release from the Fuhrer?

1258
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:33,090
诺曼底  诺曼底
Normandy, Normandy.

1259
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:35,760
我真是愚蠢
How stupid of me!

1260
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:37,920
愚蠢
Stupid.

1261
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:45,870
霍克岬据点  清晨七点十一分

1262
02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:53,290
就是那
There it is.

1263
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:07,300
你是说我们得从那爬上去吗  
You mean to tell me that's all we gotta climb?

1264
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:09,770
还没有训练爬的那么高
They're not as high as the practice ones.

1265
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:11,770
训练时可没有炮火
They wasn't shooting at us then.

1266
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:15,800
为什么不让空军或是海军来干  
Why can't the Air Force or Navy do this job?

1267
02:07:16,050 --> 02:07:19,820
从空中看不到悬崖后面掩体内的大炮
The big guns in bunkers behind the cliff can't be seen from the air.

1268
02:07:20,060 --> 02:07:23,290
不干掉它  它就会干掉我们海滩上的弟兄
We knock them out or they'll murder our guys on the beach.

1269
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:25,260
是啊  要我说的话  
Yeah, well, if you ask me...

1270
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:28,420
三个老太婆用扫帚就能把我们一扫光
...three grandmothers with brooms could sweep us off there...

1271
02:07:28,630 --> 02:07:30,590
就象从甜饼上轰走苍蝇一样
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

1272
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,950
就是它  我们要找的目标
That's it, the one we're after.

1273
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:06,290
是空的
It's empty.

1274
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:10,180
空军和海军确实给了他们好看
The Air Force and Navy really plastered this baby.

1275
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,790
可我没明白
But I don't get- -

1276
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:14,100
这些炮
The guns.

1277
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,390
都没有架好
There ain't no mounts.

1278
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:19,400
根本就还没有安装过
They've never even been installed.

1279
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:21,940
你是说
You mean...

1280
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:25,770
我们费了这么大的劲  
...we come up all this way...

1281
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:27,570
却只是一场徒劳  
...for nothing?

1282
02:15:32,690 --> 02:15:34,780
别担心  你不会有事
Don't worry, sarge, you'll be all right.

1283
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:37,330
医生  医生
Medic! Medic!

1284
02:15:38,810 --> 02:15:40,430
"请别"  "请别"
"Bitte!","Bitte!"

1285
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:48,730
他叽哩咕噜的在说什么  
I wonder what"Bitte, Bitte" means.

1286
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:02,920
你穿着救生衣搞什么鬼  
What the hell are you wearing a life preserver for?

1287
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:05,290
我不会游泳
I can't swim.

1288
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,970
诺曼底  真的是诺曼底
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

1289
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:22,740
真是疯狂  疯狂  纯粹是疯狂
This is madness, madness, sheer madness!

1290
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:25,990
什么事  
What is it?

1291
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:30,490
我刚和约德尔将军通过话  元首已经醒了
I just talked to General Jodl, the Fuhrer is awake.

1292
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:36,300
我才不在乎他醒没醒  装甲预备队的事怎么样  
I don't care if he's awake or not! What about the reserve panzers?

1293
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:41,640
元首在大发雷霆  
The Fuhrer went into one of his tantrums...

1294
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:45,050
所以没人敢提任何事
...and no one dared bring up the subject.

1295
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:47,780
那就是还处于预备状态
They're still held in reserve!

1296
02:16:48,390 --> 02:16:50,520
是的  元帅
Yes, field marshal.

1297
02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:56,520
长官  如果你亲自打给元首  
Sir, if you would call the Fuhrer yourself...

1298
02:16:56,930 --> 02:17:00,290
我相信他会尊重你的看法
...I am convinced he would respect your views.

1299
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,070
打给他  
Call him?

1300
02:17:02,310 --> 02:17:05,160
打给那个波希米亚下士  
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

1301
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:09,480
要我向他奴颜卑膝  
Crawl on my knees to him?!

1302
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:12,780
不  连想都不要想
No! It is out of the question!

1303
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:21,920
"用单调的忧郁刺伤我的心"
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."

1304
02:17:22,370 --> 02:17:23,420
什么意思  
What's that?

1305
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:26,970
没什么  已经没有意义了
Nothing, nothing of importance.

1306
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:30,570
来  我来帮你
Here, let me help you.

1307
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:34,910
你还好吧  汤姆  快  他们在上边
You all right, Tom? Come on, they're up there.

1308
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:41,110
-头  -怎么
- Sir. - Well?

1309
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:44,760
史密斯要我转告你  他的人已准备好
Mr. Smith says to tell you he's stood his men too.

1310
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,350
德军带着机枪和迫击炮推进到了树林里
The Jerries are moving up into the woods... ...with machine guns and mortars.

1311
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,260
-要弟兄们做好准备  -告诉弟兄们　　
- Tell the men to stand firm! - Tell the chaps- -

1312
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:56,570
准备应付敌人下一轮猛烈反攻
Tell them to expect another counterattack, a heavy one.

1313
02:18:00,980 --> 02:18:03,010
-拿着伙计  -谢谢
- Here you are, mate. - Ta.

1314
02:18:06,990 --> 02:18:08,720
-什么事  -听　　　
- What's the matter? - Listen.

1315
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:10,780
我听到了风笛声
I thought I heard bagpipes.

1316
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,860
别傻了
Don't be daft!

1317
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:24,730
我告诉你听到了风笛声  是援兵
I told you I heard bagpipes! It's the reinforcements.

1318
02:18:38,900 --> 02:18:39,960
是拉瓦特
It's Lovat!

1319
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:49,270
快
Come on!

1320
02:18:49,850 --> 02:18:51,300
快
Come on!

1321
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,440
-抱歉来晚了  -比不来要好
- Sorry I'm late. - Better than never, sir.

1322
02:19:20,650 --> 02:19:22,050
真高兴见到你  希米
Glad to see you, Shimmy.

1323
02:19:26,830 --> 02:19:29,990
你们正好被当成了靶子  情况如何  
You boys are right on target. What's the situation?

1324
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:33,120
德军在一英里外的树林中重新部署
Jerry's regrouping in the woods, about a mile.

1325
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:35,270
有迫击炮和重机枪
With mortars and heavy machine guns.

1326
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:36,560
有多少  
Numbers?

1327
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,500
不知道  希米  但似乎正在集结更多兵力
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem to be moving forward in force.

1328
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:44,010
那样的话  我们就更不能等了
In that case, we won't wait.

1329
02:19:44,850 --> 02:19:46,210
最好还是行动
We'd better get moving.

1330
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:48,740
好了  我们要穿过去
All right, we're going across.

1331
02:19:48,990 --> 02:19:50,180
-米林  -是
- Millin! - Sir?

1332
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:52,620
吹"黑熊"
"Black Bear," sir.

1333
02:19:53,090 --> 02:19:55,360
好了  来吧
All right, come on.

1334
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:57,020
都起来
Everybody up!

1335
02:19:57,570 --> 02:19:59,020
出发
On your feet!

1336
02:20:05,410 --> 02:20:08,540
是他  他又在吹了
There he goes. He's at it again.

1337
02:20:08,910 --> 02:20:11,640
你这辈子听过这么难听的声音吗  
Ever hear such a bleeding racket in all your life?

1338
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:14,610
没错  爱尔兰人吹风笛就是这样
Yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes.

1339
02:20:30,210 --> 02:20:32,340
坚守至援兵到来
Hold until relieved.

1340
02:20:32,610 --> 02:20:34,310
坚守至援兵到来
Hold until relieved.

1341
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:41,610
北偏东方向北偏东方向圣米尔伊格里斯在这边
North by east, north by east. Sainte- Mere- Eglise is that way.

1342
02:20:42,090 --> 02:20:43,980
有人移动过路标
Somebody turned that sign around.

1343
02:20:44,190 --> 02:20:47,890
队里除了我就没人看一下指南针吗  
Doesn't anybody in this outfit look at a compass besides me?

1344

He wants your permission to pull back and regroup outside of town.

1371

No, damn it. We came here to take Sainte- Mere- Eglise.

隆美尔说得对

这是我们的部下  汤姆
These are our men, Tom.

1444
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:34,420
带他们来难道是为了送死  然后让剩下的人逃跑吗  
You think we brought them in so some die and ask the rest to turn tail?

1445
02:34:34,660 --> 02:34:37,430
见鬼  不  我们要拿下那个山头
Hell, no. We're gonna get up that hill.

What about weapons, general? My men lost everything.

1463

他们得有装备才行
They gotta have something to fight with.

1464
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:50,390
解除死伤人员的武装

1465
02:35:50,630 --> 02:35:52,620
凡是可用的武器都带上

1466
02:35:52,800 --> 02:35:55,490
用不着我说  你们都清楚
I don't have to tell you the score, you all know it.

1467
02:35:55,770 --> 02:35:58,660
只有两种人能留在海滩上
Only two kinds of people are gonna stay on this beach:

Those that are already dead and those that will die. Get off your butts!

怎么样  
Yes?

据驱逐舰传来的报告说"奥马哈海滩"凶多吉少
According to reports from the offshore destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.

1473
02:36:31,810 --> 02:36:34,540
没有迹象...报告原文是
There's no evidence- - To quote the report exactly:

1474
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:39,070
"海滩上观察不到有任何活动的迹象"
"There is no evidence of any movement that can be observed off the beach."

1475
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:42,890
我还是再看一遍比较好
I'd better have a look through these.

1476
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:47,930
艾克对此有何反应  
How is lke taking it?

1477
02:36:48,130 --> 02:36:51,920
和其他人一样  长官  在焦急等待
Like everybody else, sir. Hanging on by his fingernails.

1478
02:36:54,340 --> 02:36:58,070
不  不  我们必须照方案六重新部署
No, no! We must regroup according to Plan Six!

1479
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:06,210
喂  喂  能听到吗  
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

1480
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:09,910
我是说我们必须照方案六重新部署
I said we must regroup according to Plan Six.

1481
02:37:11,030 --> 02:37:12,760
废话
Nonsense!

1482
02:37:13,030 --> 02:37:16,300
如果装甲师能来还不算太晚
If the panzers arrive, we still have time to use them.

1483
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:22,070
我们乘车去海岸
We'll drive to the coast!

1484
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:24,380
要销毁文件吗  
Shall we remove the files?

1485
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:29,380
这我不在乎  我要马上去前线  去诺曼底
I don't care! I want to get to the front at once, to Normandy!

1486
02:37:29,590 --> 02:37:30,610
是  将军
Yes, general.

1487
02:37:58,060 --> 02:38:00,420
-其他人在哪  -什么　　　
- Where is everybody? - What?

1488
02:38:02,830 --> 02:38:05,030
我说其他人在哪  
I said, where is everybody?

1489
02:38:07,470 --> 02:38:09,430
我听不见
I can't hear you.

1490
02:38:10,670 --> 02:38:12,540
是那口大钟
It's them bells.

1491
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:15,630
在我耳朵里响了足有十个钟头
I've had them in my ears for 10 hours.

1492
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:18,840
叮-当叮-当　　
Ding- dong, ding- dong.

1493
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:22,810
嘿  中士  兰斯少校在哪  
Hey, sergeant, where's Major Lance?

1494
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:25,480
指挥所转移到了那幢建筑  他在那
We moved the CP to that building. The major's there.

1495
02:38:25,730 --> 02:38:27,590
去找他  中校来了
Get him, the colonel's here.

1496
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:30,260
什么  
What?

1497
02:38:32,270 --> 02:38:34,260
停下
Hold it!

1498
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:46,350
中校  见到你太好了
Colonel, am I glad to see you!

1499
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,580
那些尸体  把那些尸体弄下来
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

1500
02:38:50,860 --> 02:38:53,250
怎么让他们留在上面  取下来
Why are you leaving them up there? Get them down!

1501
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:55,220
我们一直处在火力之下
But we've been under fire, sir.

1502
02:38:55,530 --> 02:38:57,450
我知道  但我不管
I know you have, but I don't care!

1503
02:38:57,700 --> 02:38:59,900
快取下  取下
Get them down! Down!

1504
02:39:00,270 --> 02:39:04,230
-我不想让弟兄们留在那  -带一队人去办　　　　
- I don't want those boys left there. - Take a detail and cut them down.

1505
02:39:04,540 --> 02:39:06,310
-马上去  -是长官
- At once! - Yes, sir.

1506
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:15,220
我们的部队和海上的军队之间有接应吗  
Has there been a linkup between our forces and the troops from the sea?

1507
02:39:15,390 --> 02:39:19,620
不知道  少校  我连他们是否已经登陆都不知道
I don't know, major. I don't even know if the landings took place.

1508
02:39:19,860 --> 02:39:24,620
我只知道必须守住这个镇直到接应部队前来
But I am sure we're gonna hold this town until the linkup does come.

1509
02:39:24,900 --> 02:39:29,400
无论是今天  明天  还是要等到地狱冻结
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow, till hell freezes over.

1510
02:39:31,080 --> 02:39:32,940
哪怕只看在他们份上
For their sake, if for no other reason.

1511
02:39:33,150 --> 02:39:35,640
告诉我敌人的位置在哪
Show me the enemy positions.

1512
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:38,740
是  长官  德国人的据点就在那
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point is right there.

1513
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:41,790
就在那边的山上  还没有坦克
That's over there on the hill. They've got no tanks yet.

1514
02:39:42,090 --> 02:39:46,090
他们在公路上方布置了重炮  迫击炮和机枪
They've got heavy guns, mortars and machine gun positions at the top of that road.

1515
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:48,530
你有多少人  
How many men have you got?

1516
02:39:48,700 --> 02:39:49,790
不够
Not enough.

1517
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:53,920
上尉和威尔逊中尉带A连去增援兰斯少校
Captain and Lieutenant Wilson will take A Company and reinforce Major Lance.

1518
02:39:54,610 --> 02:39:59,340
其他的人跟我们一起向公路前进
The rest of the command will follow us straight up that road.

1519
02:40:00,650 --> 02:40:01,670
祝你好运  少校
Good luck, major.

1520
02:40:01,950 --> 02:40:04,470
好的  A连  离队
All right, A Company, fall out.

1521
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:06,810
-二等兵  -是长官
- Private. - Yes, sir.

1522
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:08,180
真是地狱战场
It's a hell of a war.

1523
02:40:08,390 --> 02:40:10,950
我愿意和您并肩作战  中校
It's a privilege to serve with you, colonel.

1524
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:15,190
但愿我们能完成我们来此的目的
Well, God willing, we'll do what we came here to do.

1525
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:17,290
准备好了  头
Ready, sir.

1526
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:19,300
出发
Move out!

1527
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:33,080
老头肯定是从昨天开始改变的
The old man sure has changed since yesterday.

1528
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,260
也可能是我们改变了  
Or maybe it's just that we've changed...

1529
02:40:42,370 --> 02:40:44,000
从昨天开始
...since yesterday.

1530
02:40:51,750 --> 02:40:54,380
拉瓦特已率突击队抵达大桥
Lovat and his commandos have reached the bridge.

1531
02:40:55,490 --> 02:40:56,920
鲍勃  你在听吗  
Bob, did you hear?

1532
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:59,180
是的  我在听
Yes, I heard.

1533
02:41:00,660 --> 02:41:05,120
"圣米尔伊格里斯已被八十二空降师占领"
"Sainte-Mere-Eglise captured by units of the 82nd Airborne."

1534
02:41:06,970 --> 02:41:09,800
"一○一空降师正在'犹他海滩'推进"
" 101 Airborne driving on Utah."

1535
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:12,730
很好  很好
That's good. Good.

1536
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:18,070
是的  是不错  但如果不能从"奥马哈海滩"脱身就毫无意义  这我们都清楚
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

1537
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:22,980
我们拿下了两处滩头阵地  一处是英军区  一处是"犹他海滩"
We'll have two cut- off beachheads, one in British zone and one at Utah. Yes...

1538
02:41:23,320 --> 02:41:25,480
但是中间是德军
...and the Germans in between.

1539
02:41:40,980 --> 02:41:42,810
你们是工兵吗  
You guys engineers?

1540
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:45,980
是  长官  第二九九特种工兵营
Yes, sir, 299th.

1541
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:49,110
指挥官呢  这里由谁负责  
Where are your officers? Who's in charge here?

1542
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:52,210
我想是由我负责  长官  指挥官都不在
I guess I am, sir. None of our officers made it in.

1543
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:54,450
装备呢  爆破筒能用吗  
What about your equipment? Those torpedoes work?

1544
02:41:54,730 --> 02:41:56,650
是的  长官  当然能用
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!

1545
02:41:58,030 --> 02:42:00,730
-你叫什么中士  -J・H・弗勒长官
- What's your name, sergeant? - It's Fuller, sir, John H.

1546
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,500
现在起你是弗勒少尉  不管你愿不愿意
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on, whether you like it or not.

1547
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:10,610
派人带上爆破筒去溪谷底部
You send some men down to the foot of that gully with those torpedoes.

1548
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:14,620
-你和其余的人跟我来  -是长官　　　　　　
- You and the rest of the men follow me. - Yes, sir!

1549
02:42:14,890 --> 02:42:18,420
好了  弟兄们  带上装备离开这
All right, men! Let's move that equipment down here.

1550
02:42:24,830 --> 02:42:28,260
-我有支枪长官  -很好小伙子　
- I got a rifle, sir. - Well, good for you, son!

1551
02:42:28,910 --> 02:42:30,400
"轻骑兵"在待命  长官
The Rangers are ready, general.

1552
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:32,960
好的  少校  叫他们出发
Okay, major, move them out.

1553
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:35,870
上尉  让他们出发
Captain, move them up.

1554
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:38,310
出发
Move them up!

1555
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:42,390
-什么事  -我们准备好了
- Well, Tom? - We're ready.

1556
02:42:42,620 --> 02:42:44,250
一切已准备就绪
As ready as we'll ever be.

1557
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:47,330
会成功的  一定会成功
It'll work. It's got to work.

1558
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:53,490
我们在这会被干掉  倒不如推进到内陆再死
We're getting murdered here! We might as well move inland and get murdered!

1559
02:42:57,510 --> 02:42:59,070
-准备好了  -是长官　　
- You ready? - Yes, sir.

1560
02:42:59,310 --> 02:43:01,940
给我把那个路障清除掉
You're gonna blow that roadblock for me.

1561
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:04,710
收到信号立刻行动  懂吗  
When I give the word everything pops at once. Okay?

1562
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:07,320
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1563
02:43:33,460 --> 02:43:37,090
我们先要用爆破筒在铁丝网上炸个洞
First, we gotta blow a hole through that wire with bangalores.

1564
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:41,420
能成功的话就把所有炸药填到墙底下
If that works, we'll pack everything we've got into that wall.

1565
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:43,960
好了  上
All right, let's go!

1566
02:46:43,730 --> 02:46:48,330
行了  冲啊  冲  冲
All right, let's go! Go! Go!

1567
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:51,250
我们必须离开  公路干线遭到了空袭
We must leave. The main highway is under aerial attack.

1568
02:47:51,490 --> 02:47:53,180
不用你说
You don't say!

1569
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,170
别担心  美国佬
Don't worry, Yank.

1570
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,420
他死了
He's dead.

1571
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:03,840
给我一支烟  我想抽烟想得要命
Give me a cigarette. I'm dying for a cigarette.

1572
02:50:11,730 --> 02:50:13,170
伤得很重吗  
You hurt bad?

1573
02:50:17,110 --> 02:50:19,100
夜里被击落了
Shot down during the night.

1574
02:50:23,050 --> 02:50:27,220
他想看我死了没有  被我干掉了  
He was gonna make sure of me, but I got him...

1575
02:50:27,620 --> 02:50:29,080
用这个
...with this.

1576
02:50:39,770 --> 02:50:43,700
你杀过人没有  我是指  面对面地  
You ever killed a man? I mean, face to face?

1577
02:50:45,580 --> 02:50:47,600
没有
No.

1578
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:51,450
我也没有  面对面地
Neither had l, face to face.

1579
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:57,410
我一直坐在这看着他
I've been sitting here looking at him.

1580
02:50:59,100 --> 02:51:01,760
你发现他有什么特别之处没有  
Have you noticed anything peculiar about him?

1581
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,700
没有
No.

1582
02:51:14,620 --> 02:51:16,240
他的靴子  
He's got his boots...

1583
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:18,750
穿错了脚
...on the wrong feet.

1584
02:51:26,300 --> 02:51:28,220
他一定非常匆忙对吧  
He must have been in a big hurry, huh?

1585
02:51:30,470 --> 02:51:31,700
严重吗  
Is it bad?

1586
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:36,470
裂了个大口子  
Split wide open...

1587
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:39,870
从胯部一直到膝盖
...from the crotch to the knee.

1588
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:44,580
有个军医来过  给我注射了吗啡
A medic came along and gave me a shot of morphine.

1589
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,920
但愿他在药效失去前回来
I hope he'll be back before it wears off.

1590
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:52,490
他说他会的
He said he would.

1591
02:51:55,430 --> 02:51:57,130
他替你缝合没有  
Did he sew you up?

1592
02:52:00,980 --> 02:52:06,000
他上岸时把大部分器材都弄丢了
Well, when he came ashore he lost most of his equipment.

1593
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:09,520
所以他缝合时只能  
So he pinned it together...

1594
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,610
用别针
...with safety pins.

1595
02:52:24,270 --> 02:52:25,830
天就快黑了
Getting on toward night.

1596
02:52:34,020 --> 02:52:35,280
你知道吗  
You know something?

1597
02:52:36,820 --> 02:52:38,810
我整天都没开过一枪
I haven't fired my gun all day.

1598
02:52:39,330 --> 02:52:43,110
我不断听到枪声  但每次等我赶到  就没人了
I keep hearing shooting, but every time I get there, everybody's gone.

1599
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:48,500
真滑稽  是吧  
Funny, isn't it?

1600
02:52:49,870 --> 02:52:51,100
他死了
He's dead.

1601
02:52:52,380 --> 02:52:54,000
我瘸了
I'm crippled.

1602
02:52:55,250 --> 02:52:56,840
你迷路了
