1
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:32,802
London calling,with Frenchmen
speaking to their countrymen.

2
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,898
Take a look at that.
What a handsome sight...

3
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,571
...the pride of the Third Reich.

4
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:41,778
The brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners.

5
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:47,311
So that's a sample of the
master race. In a pig's eye.

6
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,679
What's going on here?

7
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:17,672
(Tr.V.P.I.B.)

8
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:36,660
In this darkest hour,
in the gloom of night...

9
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,787
...we must not despair.

10
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:45,090
Let us keep our faith intact,
unswerving!

11
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,671
For each of us...

12
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,709
...deliverance is coming.

13
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,342
We need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast.

14
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,535
At every beach,on every dune...

15
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,046
...on every rock.

16
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:31,344
How many have been installed?

17
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,145
Four million,Herr Field Marshal.

18
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,514
It has to be six million by May.

19
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,982
-Six million.
-Our men are constantly deployed.

20
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,153
There's no point in even
discussing rest.

21
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:46,997
-The troops are completely exhausted.
-My dear Herr von Salmuth...

22
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,194
...which would your troops rather be...

23
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:51,463
...exhausted or dead?

24
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,699
Just look at it,gentlemen.

25
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,269
How calm,how peaceful it is.

26
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:00,342
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...

27
00:05:00,683 --> 00:05:02,571
...between the Allies and us.

28
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:08,583
But beyond that peaceful horizon,
a monster waits.

29
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,622
A coiled spring of men,
ships and planes...

30
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,952
...straining to be released against us.

31
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,329
But not a single Allied soldier
shall reach the shore.

32
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:25,564
Not a single Anglo-American
shall set foot on the beaches.

33
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,599
Whenever or wherever this invasion
may come,gentlemen...

34
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,144
...I shall destroy the enemy there,
at the water's edge.

35
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,910
Believe me,gentlemen.

36
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,611
The first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive.

37
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:47,757
For the Allies as well as the Germans,
it will be the longest day...

38
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:51,130
...the longest day.

39
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,801
-The poem by Verlaine?
-Yes,the first verse.

40
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:30,471
Play it back!

41
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,128
Silence!

42
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,078
Frenchmen speaking
to their countrymen.

43
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:49,076
Here are some personal messages.

44
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,958
"The long sobs of the violins
of autumn. "

45
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:57,456
I repeat:

46
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:01,497
"The long sobs of the violins
of autumn. "

47
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,633
Have you notified all commands?

48
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:20,608
If Berlin is right,
when we intercept the second verse...

49
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:25,122
...it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours.

50
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,725
Give me the text of the second verse.

51
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,437
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

52
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:54,274
We've intercepted hundreds of
messages in the last year,hundreds!

53
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,687
I've ordered alerts again and again.

54
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:01,954
Why should this poem mean more
than other messages?

55
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:03,654
Tell me this:

56
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:08,496
Does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when?

57
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:11,070
Of course it doesn't.

58
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,900
I have half a million men
under my command.

59
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:20,070
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...

60
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:25,009
...just because a pair of nitwits
in Berlin intercept a poem?

61
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:29,180
No,Blumentritt,no alert.

62
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,590
And especially not in this weather.

63
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,228
-Anything else?
-No,sir.

64
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,043
Good morning,field marshal.

65
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,174
-Any news?
-Nothing important.

66
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:02,186
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.

67
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,724
Nothing much happened
last night. The storm.

68
00:09:05,928 --> 00:09:09,750
That's all I'm interested in
this morning,the storm.

69
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:15,460
It came from nowhere,
blew my roses to bits.

70
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,367
There are 5-foot waves
in the Channel...

71
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:23,204
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles
per hour.

72
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:25,876
For the month of June...

73
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:28,606
...it's the worst Channel
storm in 20 years.

74
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,249
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?

75
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,984
General JodI will see
the F¨¹hrer today...

76
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,954
...and confirm the appointment for you.

77
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,858
Will you still go to Germany
as planned?

78
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,659
Can you think of a better time?

79
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:51,297
The weather is expected to continue
like this for another week.

80
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,308
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

81
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:44,713
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

82
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,793
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.

83
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:50,328
You expect us to eat this slop again?

84
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,429
I don't care what you do with it,mac.

85
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,431
Eat it,throw it out.

86
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,194
I get paid for cooking it.

87
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,167
Come on. Put it on.

88
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,033
Snap it up.

89
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,643
Jerk the lead.

90
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,677
Didn't you get any sleep?

91
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,839
Are you kidding? I haven't slept
since we got here.

92
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,480
I got the absolute lowdown.

93
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,719
It's on for tonight. For sure.

94
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,256
Yeah.

95
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,855
I got in this crap game
with this guy from F Company.

96
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:25,886
-He's an orderly for some general.
-Move it. Move it.

97
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,370
Hey,Hutchy!

98
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,666
Hutchy,I want to ask you something.

99
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,068
Hey,Hutchinson...

100
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:40,008
...do you think they'd let me write
home? If it was really important?

101
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:43,241
Not likely,mate. Security.

102
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,715
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.

103
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,583
It's the wife,you see.
She's going to have a baby.

104
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:49,983
Your first,is it?

105
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,422
Oh,it's not mine,but I'm dead
worried about her.

106
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,856
She's not too strong,you see.

107
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,053
Man,that stink.

108
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:28,718
Diesel oil,backed-up toilets,vomit.

109
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:32,158
And there ain't no place left
to get sick in.

110
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,730
The puke bags is full.

111
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,235
The fire buckets is full.

112
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,235
All we got left is our helmets.

113
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,102
June.

114
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,946
Every June my old man
used to take me camping...

115
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:56,682
...up in the Blue Mountains.

116
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:00,926
We'd hunt and fish all day long.

117
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:04,425
And at night...

118
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:08,422
...we'd sleep out under the stars.

119
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,200
Didn't even need a blanket.

120
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,379
June.

121
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,214
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.

122
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:28,821
Don't it ever stop?

123
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:32,185
Look,Dad,all I want
to do is get going.

124
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,592
Wind or no wind. Even if we land
in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.

125
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:39,287
-Come to think of it--
-Colonel wants us.

126
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:41,230
All of us.

127
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,366
I've notified the adjutant,
change in schedule.

128
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:55,314
After briefing session today...

129
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:59,045
...all troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment.

130
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:01,246
In this weather,sir?

131
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,916
Of course,Harding,if you can ensure
that we'll land in France...

132
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,755
-...in sunshine and dry weather.
-Didn't mean that.

133
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,363
-What did you mean?
-It isn't the weather.

134
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:14,626
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.

135
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,259
I don't think I have to remind you...

136
00:14:17,506 --> 00:14:20,839
...that this war has been going on
for almost five years.

137
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,442
Half of Europe has been
overrun and occupied.

138
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:26,169
We're comparative newcomers.

139
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:30,647
England's gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1940.

140
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:35,084
I am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go.

141
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,153
Do I make myself clear?

142
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:38,950
Yes,sir. Quite clear.

143
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:42,955
Three million men penned up
on this island.

144
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,895
All over England,
in staging areas like this.

145
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:51,299
We're on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times.

146
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,735
Three million men out there...

147
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:58,800
...keyed up,and waiting for
that big step-off.

148
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,376
They aren't exactly alone.

149
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,912
Notify the men. Full packs
and equipment,1400 hours.

150
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,282
Yes,sir.

151
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:12,155
They said they
have both issues available.

152
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:17,394
I prefer this type.
It allows you more freedom.

153
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:20,762
Quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach.

154
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,426
-Well?
-It's on.

155
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,432
Tonight,as scheduled.

156
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:29,441
-If the weather isn't worse.
-How worse can it get?

157
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:32,841
Ike has called a high-level
conference for 9:30.

158
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:37,313
I am not Eisenhower. I am
an assistant division commander.

159
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:42,249
I don't know from nothing,
but he can't call it off again.

160
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,761
Frank,turn that thing off.

161
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,352
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.

162
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,156
Troops ready to go.

163
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,232
Eleven thousand planes on the line.

164
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:58,031
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.

165
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,332
Norm,relax.

166
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,006
RAF says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began.

167
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,545
So they told us yesterday
and the day before.

168
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:09,272
Look,Norm.

169
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,517
We're all of us just as...

170
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:16,279
...dedicated to this thing as you are,
just as anxious to get going.

171
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,482
And that includes Ike.

172
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:21,651
Now if he calls it off again,
he knows what he's doing.

173
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,559
Of course he does. I know that.

174
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,565
I'm just thinking about those
assault troops. 200,000 of them...

175
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:32,159
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.

176
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:36,162
Some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days.

177
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:38,639
I say go.

178
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,474
Go. Weather or no weather.

179
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:44,712
No!

180
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:48,186
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.

181
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,349
-Hey,give me 50 bucks. I'm busted.
-I'm not doing so good myself.

182
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,299
Hey,lend me 50 bucks?

183
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,070
-Lend me 20 bucks?
-Drop dead.

184
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,550
Lend me 10?

185
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:27,418
-Fifty on a bet.
-I got it.

186
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:29,685
One,two,three,four,five.

187
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,592
Fifty!

188
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,623
Let me hear it,let me hear it.

189
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,328
-Five and two,four and three.
-Six! That's the way we go!

190
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,965
Seven points in a row. It ain't
logical,it just ain't logical.

191
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:48,103
-There's 100 out there.
-A hundred dollars,$20.

192
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,874
Anything open?

193
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,041
-Forty more.
-Forty more.

194
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:53,915
You got a bet.

195
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:58,248
-Okay,you mother-loving--
-Just a minute. Wait a minute.

196
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,788
Here you are. Use this.

197
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,487
-You don't think I'd--
-I don't think anything.

198
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:06,996
I just like to hear the sound
when it comes out of the cup.

199
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,859
That's it. Shake it.

200
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:15,732
Okay. Let me see what you do
with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.

201
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,502
-What is it?
-Nothing.

202
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,611
-Seven!
-That's what I wanted!

203
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,111
Who put this cup in the game?

204
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:25,114
-Next shooter. Who's coming up?
-I'll go $ 100.

205
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,914
He's shooting 100.
Who's got it?

206
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,489
-Watch your side bets.
-A hundred dollars.

207
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,823
You got a letter for me.
Schultz,huh?

208
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:38,196
Yeah,that's it.

209
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,027
Thanks,buddy.

210
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,142
-How much did you take him for?
-Not much. Just a hair over 2500.

211
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:55,713
-Twenty-five hundred?
-Yeah.

212
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,316
Oh,man,2500?

213
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,614
It's too bad you had to win it now.

214
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:03,351
What do you mean,now?

215
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,652
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?

216
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,193
Five I take with me to Paris
to blow on the broads and wine.

217
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:14,857
A thou I leave here for seed
when I get back.

218
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,229
And the rest I send to my mother.

219
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:43,019
Oh,man,2500. And in Paris.

220
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,889
You always was lucky.

221
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,022
Hey,remember that night
in Fort Bragg?

222
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,470
I remember it.

223
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:56,367
You know,I think I sneak over there
and give it a big whang myself.

224
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,533
Why not? What's to lose?

225
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,707
Damn it.

226
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,376
Why did he have to mention
Fort Bragg?

227
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,889
I was lucky,all right,
in that crap game.

228
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,789
Next day I break my leg in a jump.

229
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,596
And two months in traction.

230
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:36,771
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

231
00:20:38,953 --> 00:20:42,013
That's more money I ever had
in my whole life.

232
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,285
I know.

233
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:52,525
Man,I just know.

234
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,241
I wonder how long it takes
to lose $2500.

235
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,656
Pint of sludge,Ted.

236
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,835
Oh,hello,Dave.
Hey,you seen Johnny?

237
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,303
Yes.

238
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,875
Well,where is he?

239
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:41,338
Come on,Dave.

240
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,115
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.

241
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,347
Where is he?

242
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,387
At the bottom...

243
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:51,216
...of the Channel.

244
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,595
You mean...

245
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:04,600
...he's bought it?

246
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:07,104
Ack-ack over Calais.

247
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:11,335
He jumped clean,
but his parachute didn't open.

248
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:22,511
That leaves just you
in the squadron,Dave.

249
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:27,149
I mean,of the old 1940 mob.

250
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:30,195
What's always worried me
about being one of the few...

251
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,992
...is the way we keep on
getting fewer.

252
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:35,898
Yeah.

253
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,998
Poor old Johnny.

254
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,004
Bad luck,it happening now.

255
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:45,634
-Now,then. What's the difference?
-He went through the Battle of Britain!

256
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:50,213
And now if the big show
starts tonight...

257
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:52,340
...he won't be in it.

258
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,280
Look,will you please
shut up about him?

259
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,854
All right,all right.
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

260
00:22:58,593 --> 00:23:00,356
You heard something about tonight?

261
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:03,518
No,no. I haven't heard anything.

262
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:06,962
-What are you talking about then?
-Well,it's just....

263
00:23:07,368 --> 00:23:10,701
-Go on,go on.
-I have a feeling it's on for tonight.

264
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,362
-That's all.
-A feeling.

265
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:15,864
Take your feeling somewhere else.

266
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:18,805
I've got a letter to write.

267
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:21,707
I've had this feeling since I woke up.

268
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,071
I've had it with me all day long.

269
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,549
I can't shake it off.

270
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:30,418
It's tonight. I know it is.

271
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:32,420
All right,it's tonight.

272
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:33,991
Suits me fine.

273
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:37,061
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!

274
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,491
I mean...

275
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:44,400
...as soon as I finish this beer.

276
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,350
-General,can you spare me a minute?
-Come in.

277
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:03,284
-Thank you.
-Can I get you coffee?

278
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:05,755
-No,thanks.
-I'll get some for myself.

279
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,031
Is it still raining?

280
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:19,830
On and off,off and on.

281
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:22,666
Sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

282
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:23,935
What?

283
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:28,534
I say,sometimes I wonder
which side God's on.

284
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,038
Good question.

285
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,775
What's on your mind,Van?

286
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:36,047
I'm concerned about the placement
of our drop zones.

287
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,518
Go on.

288
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,320
I know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new...

289
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,861
...but you've given me
a tough nut to crack.

290
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:47,623
-It gets tougher every time I try.
-I know,Van.

291
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:51,396
the only road the Germans can use...

292
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:55,131
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.

293
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,466
And it has to be held.

294
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:01,337
That's why I gave you the job,Van.

295
00:25:04,986 --> 00:25:07,079
-Can I use your board?
-Of course.

296
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:15,087
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.

297
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:18,719
Down here is the swamp area
that the Germans have flooded.

298
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:22,721
And in between,four miles
from the town,is our drop zone.

299
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:25,532
Now,if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot...

300
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,595
...we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down.

301
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:32,074
If we overshoot,we come down
like clay pigeons...

302
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:35,237
...smack dab in the center

303
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,012
That's why I gave the men training
in low-level jumps near the villages.

304
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,813
So I've heard.

305
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:47,721
Got a complaint from
the city council at Bexhall.

306
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:52,559
Some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town.

307
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:56,589
-Tied up traffic for an hour.
-That's true,sir. I was with them.

308
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,704
Sudden crosswind hit us,
swept us over the treetops...

309
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,966
...scattered us all over the place.

310
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:08,569
-Where did you end up?
-In the courtyard of a convent.

311
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,575
Relax,Van. Sit down.

312
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:16,913
The last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us.

313
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:20,789
I hear you've been working yourself
and your battalion hard.

314
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:23,054
Almost without a stop.

315
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,294
Now that we're almost
at the end of the line...

316
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,801
...why don't you try easing up
on yourself and on the men?

317
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:34,866
Sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point.

318
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:38,131
Sometimes a commander can too.

319
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:42,572
Well...

320
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,611
...if there's any further delay...

321
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:50,587
...I request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones.

322
00:26:50,825 --> 00:26:52,952
All right. Put it in writing.

323
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,527
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.

324
00:26:56,297 --> 00:27:01,257
But Ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at Southwick House.

325
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:04,397
If it's on,we'll get
the green light by 9:30.

326
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,403
-What are the chances?
-Better than 50-50.

327
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,597
Forget everything I said. I got
the best battalion in this division...

328
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,041
...and they're ready.

329
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,060
Here it is. The latest report.

330
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:52,672
-It's Southwick House,sir.
-Stagg here.

331
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:56,714
Yes,sir. The new front's moving in
much faster than we thought.

332
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,058
Yes,sir,it's definitely improving.

333
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:03,860
I'll be there,sir. 9:30.

334
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:14,068
-Would you like some more tea,sir?
-Coffee,and make it black.

335
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:15,334
Please.

336
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,608
One moment,Colonel Priller.

337
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,506
Why wasn't he court-martialed?

338
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,671
He shot down 132 planes.

339
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,478
Hello,Pips,old boy.

340
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:29,610
Don't call me "Pips,old boy."

341
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:33,281
You were a rotten pilot
when we flew in Russia.

342
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:37,054
You're flying a desk now,but
you're still a rotten pilot!

343
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:40,364
What's that you're saying?

344
00:28:40,568 --> 00:28:44,857
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...

345
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:49,566
...with only two planes,
two stinking crates!

346
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:54,578
Oh,sure,sure,your orders
were followed!

347
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:57,080
Now my squadrons
are God-knows-where!

348
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:02,716
My supplies are all gone.
What am I supposed to do now?

349
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:08,123
But Pips,we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons. We had to!

350
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,652
Look what happened to our airstrips
around the Pas-de-Calais!

351
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,733
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!

352
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:20,130
You move us back instead of forward!

353
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:25,267
Sure,I know the weather's lousy
and they probably won't invade...

354
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:28,607
...but what would happen if they did?

355
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:32,979
But you know I can't get there
with my equipment for two days.

356
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:36,848
I tell you,you're all crazy!

357
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,501
Priller has always been a hothead...

358
00:29:57,812 --> 00:30:00,474
...but let's not underestimate him.

359
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,215
What he says is not entirely illogical.

360
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,980
What's the weather report?

361
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,520
Slightly better over the Channel.

362
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,688
I wouldn't be surprised if--

363
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:18,284
-When's the next weather report?
-Tonight at 8,general.

364
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,790
Keep me posted on the weather.

365
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,896
You made my dinner reservations?

366
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:26,902
Yes,I did,general.

367
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,802
Cancel everything.

368
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:41,515
-Have you got them?
-Yes,sir.

369
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:42,781
Let me have them.

370
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:48,620
Shoes for my wife,I had them
specially made in Paris...

371
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:53,720
...for her birthday,tomorrow,
the sixth of June.

372
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,357
Please wish her a happy birthday.

373
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,060
Thank you,Speidel.

374
00:31:01,175 --> 00:31:04,633
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect....

375
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:08,202
Tides were right,and now....

376
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:10,641
An attack now would be embarrassing.

377
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:15,141
Let's go.
But I don't think we need worry.

378
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,203
Is the plan ready,sir?

379
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,036
Yes,yes,quite finished.

380
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,209
War games...

381
00:31:47,755 --> 00:31:50,087
...theoretical invasions.

382
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:57,086
Rush to Rennes just to push
little flags around a table.

383
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,991
Playing at war!

384
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,435
Do you win or lose,sir?

385
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:09,265
Have I ever lost?

386
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:18,005
But general,this time you play
the role of Eisenhower.

387
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:22,018
I win because I go against the rules.

388
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:26,820
We expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the Channel...

389
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:31,919
...and in good weather. But that's
too simple,too obvious.

390
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:37,263
I choose the widest part,in the
worst weather,and attack here.

391
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:39,829
In Normandy.

392
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:41,868
And in bad weather!

393
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,442
Like now...

394
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:49,409
...bad weather!

395
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,047
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.

396
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:58,485
From a meteorological standpoint,
conditions almost resemble mid-winter.

397
00:32:58,692 --> 00:32:59,886
And Normandy?

398
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:03,688
High winds,clouds,
and some fog over the beaches.

399
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:08,028
However,I can say with a certain
degree of safety...

400
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:11,533
...that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions.

401
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,763
Let me summarize,then.

402
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:19,133
What you're promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions.

403
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:20,471
Am I right?

404
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:21,807
Yes.

405
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,644
Conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements.

406
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:28,276
That's all I can promise.

407
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,889
You've done your best,Stagg.
Thank you,gentlemen.

408
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,663
Well,there it is.

409
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:43,426
We've postponed the attack
once already.

410
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:48,098
Now,either we go on the sixth,
with only marginal conditions...

411
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,872
...or postpone again...

412
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:53,836
...in the hope of getting
perfect conditions.

413
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:55,708
What do you think,Monty?

414
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,009
I say,go. Go.

415
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:00,517
I must remind everybody...

416
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:04,612
...that the American convoy
for the Omaha and Utah beaches...

417
00:34:04,858 --> 00:34:06,723
...they've farthest to go...

418
00:34:06,927 --> 00:34:10,226
...must be given the order
within the next half-hour...

419
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,594
...if the assault is to take place
on the sixth.

420
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:20,765
We can't keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships...

421
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:23,963
...in embarkation areas,indefinitely.

422
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:28,273
The longer we wait,the more
acute our security problem.

423
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,243
The next time...

424
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:32,976
...the tides and the moon
will be right....

425
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:37,849
Not before July.

426
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,789
Gentlemen...

427
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,753
...such a postponement...

428
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:51,161
...is too bitter to contemplate.

429
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:58,104
A brilliant plan,general.
Unorthodox,but brilliant.

430
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,278
Fortunately,it's only a game.

431
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:07,678
I don't think we have
much to worry about.

432
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:12,683
Eisenhower would never
take the gamble.

433
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:14,893
Never.

434
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:23,030
I'm quite positive
we must give the order.

435
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:25,996
I don't like it...

436
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,101
...but there it is.

437
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:29,904
Gentlemen...

438
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,841
...I don't see how we can possibly
do anything else but go.

439
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,357
Wilson speaking.

440
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,467
Yes,sir.

441
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:02,930
It's on,sir. Ike's made the
decision. Tonight,as scheduled!

442
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,590
Colonel Tomson speaking.

443
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:24,720
Thank you.

444
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,101
Next stop...

445
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:32,862
...Normandy.

446
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:36,868
God help us now.

447
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:50,481
Lovat here.

448
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:55,756
Gentlemen...

449
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,385
...the day we've been
waiting for has arrived.

450
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,527
Invasion! We're on our way.

451
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,200
General.

452
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:14,006
The orders have been given.
It's on.

453
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,882
Have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom.

454
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,820
All right,sergeant.

455
00:37:34,134 --> 00:37:36,932
You men are the eyes
of our airborne Army.

456
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:42,100
You,the pathfinders,will have
one job,and one job only:

457
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,066
To light the drop zones
for our paratroops.

458
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:50,045
Along with the British and Canadians
you'll be the first men...

459
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:53,081
...to land in France.
And remember this:

460
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,083
When you get to Normandy...

461
00:37:55,556 --> 00:37:57,683
...you'll only have one friend:

462
00:37:58,459 --> 00:37:59,619
God.

463
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,592
And this.

464
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,295
This...

465
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:11,627
...is Rupert.

466
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,371
Now,we are going to drop Rupert...

467
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,440
...and a lot more like him...

468
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:19,703
...behind the invasion area.

469
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:23,338
He's...

470
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:26,578
...a very extraordinary
fellow,Rupert.

471
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:29,447
He's a sort of...

472
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:32,147
...one-man army,all by himself.

473
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:34,390
Let me show you.

474
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:38,695
Let me show you what happens
when Rupert...

475
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,456
...hits the ground.

476
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,699
Sergeant,switch off
the lights,please.

477
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,503
All right,sergeant,that's all.

478
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,211
All right,come on. Simmer down.

479
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,642
Come on,up.

480
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:06,115
It's possible that Rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the Germans.

481
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:09,248
Confuse them,make them look
over their shoulders...

482
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,056
...and launch an attack
in the wrong direction.

483
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,174
Ten-hut!

484
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:27,710
-The crickets have been distributed.
-So I heard.

485
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,047
At ease!

486
00:39:33,453 --> 00:39:36,286
You're as ready as we can make you.

487
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,885
This five-cent toy...

488
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:42,918
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.

489
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:45,085
It may save your life.

490
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,897
You're gonna be landing in the dark.

491
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:51,260
On the other side of that hedgerow...

492
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:55,966
...the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are. So...

493
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,801
...one click...

494
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:00,672
...is to be answered by two clicks.

495
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:05,246
And if you don't
get that answering click...

496
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,812
...hit the dirt and open fire.

497
00:40:08,055 --> 00:40:09,079
I repeat:

498
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,121
One click...

499
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,589
...must be answered by two clicks.

500
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:18,549
Now,hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.

501
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:22,696
-Do you read me?
-Loud and clear,sir.

502
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,131
All right. One more thing.

503
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,967
Your assignment tonight is strategic.

504
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:31,134
You can't give the enemy a break.

505
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,234
Send them to hell.

506
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:41,414
That is all.

507
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:53,229
This is London calling.
This is our eighth news bulletin.

508
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:58,291
Here are some personal messages.

509
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:03,130
"Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac. "

510
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,576
"Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac. "

511
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:10,679
"John has a long mustache. "

512
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:11,976
I repeat:

513
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,107
"John has a long mustache. "

514
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,783
"John has a long mustache!"

515
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,353
"John has a long mustache!"

516
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:30,962
"John has a long mustache!"

517
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:36,332
No,not yet....

518
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:37,975
Oh,my Lord!

519
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,798
"John has a long mustache."

520
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,632
Make any sense to you,mac?

521
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:40,335
As I said last night,they're code
messages to the Resistance chaps.

522
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:43,463
Obviously,one message means
something to one group...

523
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:46,041
...and another means something
to another group.

524
00:42:46,947 --> 00:42:52,271
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

525
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:54,383
I repeat:

526
00:42:54,554 --> 00:43:01,485
"There is a fire at the travel agency. "

527
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:06,287
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

528
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,660
I repeat:

529
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:11,997
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor. "

530
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,509
The bridge,in 45 minutes.

531
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:38,795
We'll be back.

532
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:50,769
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

533
00:43:51,478 --> 00:43:52,843
I repeat:

534
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:56,903
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

535
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,442
"There is a fire at the travel agency."

536
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:16,494
The best hand I've had all night.

537
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:18,966
Let me see here....

538
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:24,474
Pardon me.

539
00:44:25,178 --> 00:44:28,705
Pardon me,general,it's come.

540
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,315
Wait. Give that to me.

541
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:33,045
What's come?

542
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:35,047
It's the second part of the message.

543
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,717
-Verlaine.
-Yes. The second verse.

544
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,654
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

545
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:44,656
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

546
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,033
We can expect the invasion
within 24 hours!

547
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:54,203
Put the 15th Army on full alert.

548
00:44:56,676 --> 00:44:58,041
Thank you.

549
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:10,875
You know,I'm too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this.

550
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:15,585
Now,where was I?
Oh,yes,two spades!

551
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,144
It's almost impossible to believe.

552
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:48,287
Every dot represents a ship.

553
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:52,557
You got battlewagons,cruisers,
destroyers,minesweepers.

554
00:45:52,766 --> 00:45:55,929
You got assault craft of every size
and every type.

555
00:45:58,071 --> 00:46:00,733
The biggest armada
the world's ever known.

556
00:46:05,812 --> 00:46:07,177
Here.

557
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:11,910
You remember it.

558
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:14,447
Remember every bit of it.

559
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:16,647
We're on the eve of a day...

560
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:20,622
...that people will talk about
long after we're dead and gone.

561
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:33,932
You wanna know something?

562
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:37,800
It gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it.

563
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:51,278
You could call it one of them...

564
00:46:51,491 --> 00:46:54,517
...crazy,quickie wartime marriages,
you know?

565
00:46:54,828 --> 00:46:57,956
Met at a dance at the USO
and all that...

566
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:00,196
...but,I mean,I took it serious.

567
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:03,664
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.

568
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:06,700
-When did you get the letter?
-Week ago.

569
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:08,032
Two weeks.

570
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:12,971
Maybe I was wrong,what I wrote her.

571
00:47:14,114 --> 00:47:17,038
I mean,she's a high-class model
and all,and I....

572
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,877
I'm not the kind of guy
to get married that easy.

573
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:25,182
I mean,it wasn't no joke to me.

574
00:47:30,363 --> 00:47:35,027
But oh,man,we really had some
wonderful times together.

575
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:38,899
And you think she's got a boyfriend?

576
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,832
Well,she never actually said so....

577
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,775
I mean....

578
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,877
You think I was right?
I mean,was I fair?

579
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:55,075
She can't get one
without your permission,right?

580
00:47:55,388 --> 00:47:57,151
You gotta give your okay.

581
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,947
I know it's the law.

582
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:02,025
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.

583
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:12,724
Well,I guess I better be
getting back to the outfit.

584
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:17,699
Good luck.

585
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:20,737
You too.

586
00:48:31,758 --> 00:48:34,955
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?

587
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,995
I don't know,Sparrow.

588
00:48:39,933 --> 00:48:42,561
I never saw him before in my life.

589
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:09,622
Happy birthday,general,
from your staff!

590
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:15,362
Thank you.

591
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:19,865
Will you cut the cake,sir?

592
00:49:21,007 --> 00:49:24,033
I trust you don't
expect me to eat it too!

593
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:52,164
What's that?

594
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:57,071
Dummkopf,that's the "V for
victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.

595
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,343
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?

596
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:42,809
Release point coming up,
Major Howard.

597
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:45,249
Right,prepare for landing.

598
00:50:45,558 --> 00:50:46,957
Cutting loose now.

599
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:48,217
Roger and out.

600
00:51:13,152 --> 00:51:15,643
Major Howard...

601
00:51:15,855 --> 00:51:18,483
...I cannot overestimate
the importance of your task.

602
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,819
The Orne River Bridge
must be captured...

603
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:22,925
...before the enemy can destroy it.

604
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:27,986
It's a vital military artery,and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition.

605
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:32,594
It must be taken by surprise
and captured intact.

606
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:37,235
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.

607
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:40,139
You will assault the garrison,
overwhelm it...

608
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,507
...and hold until relieved.

609
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:45,141
Hold until relieved.

610
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:46,579
Major Howard!

611
00:51:46,786 --> 00:51:48,481
There's the bridge coming up.

612
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:51,651
Just on our left.

613
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:03,397
Right,link your arms.

614
00:52:04,003 --> 00:52:05,197
Brace yourselves.

615
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,421
Feet up!

616
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:33,423
Hang on!

617
00:53:38,264 --> 00:53:39,390
Smoke screen. Smoke.

618
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:46,096
Up the action,bucks!
Up the action,bucks!

619
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:58,612
Right,Tom.
Over the bridge.

620
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,032
Check for demolition charges!

621
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,448
Hello! Hello!

622
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:09,451
Hello! Damn it! Hello!

623
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:11,647
Hello! Hello!

624
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,705
Clear.

625
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,719
It's working!

626
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:48,850
Hello! Hello!

627
00:55:52,698 --> 00:55:54,757
-Where's the doc?
-On the third glider.

628
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,663
There's no report from them.

629
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:58,757
-Walsh.
-Sir?

630
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:01,667
Tom,Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.

631
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:03,705
On the other end of the bridge.

632
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,276
-What happened to you?
-Broke it on landing.

633
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:08,844
-Isn't the doc with you?
-No,he's missing.

634
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:12,438
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.

635
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:15,074
I'm all right,sir.
So are the boys.

636
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:18,653
-Okay,carry on.
-Right,sir. Come on!

637
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,408
Well,I'll be....

638
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,541
Hey,doc! Doc!

639
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:48,918
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.

640
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:52,079
Sir,anybody can make a mistake.

641
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:03,959
Sir?

642
00:57:04,203 --> 00:57:07,400
The demolition charges have
been removed. It's all clear.

643
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:09,404
Good. Corporal Smith.

644
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:14,965
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.

645
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:20,078
-John,set up HQ in that pillbox.
-Right,sir.

646
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:27,249
All in less than 15 minutes.

647
00:57:30,596 --> 00:57:32,860
Only a matter of time before
they counterattack.

648
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:37,128
-What about the paratroopers?
-7th Para might not get here for hours.

649
00:57:37,503 --> 00:57:39,596
And Lovat and his commandos....

650
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:42,862
It could be midday
before they get here.

651
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:46,632
The question is,
how long can we hold?

652
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:49,242
Hold until relieved.

653
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,113
Hold until relieved.

654
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:04,322
What awful weather.
It's raining again.

655
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:06,058
Thank you.

656
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,360
Did you get the list?

657
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:17,463
General Schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games.

658
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:23,776
The commander of the 243rd
left for Rennes at 1800 hours.

659
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:24,971
Who else?

660
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,678
Also,Zimmermann of the 352nd,
12 officers in all.

661
00:58:29,822 --> 00:58:31,813
Yes,I know.

662
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:36,880
The weather is bad,so everyone
enjoys an extra night in Rennes.

663
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:39,722
I don't like it.

664
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:41,329
Any of it.

665
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:44,731
So many key officers are
away at the same time.

666
00:58:45,037 --> 00:58:47,096
I don't know why,but I don't like it.

667
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,440
But the war games have been
scheduled for a week....

668
00:58:51,677 --> 00:58:55,443
Yes,for tomorrow,not tonight.

669
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,513
Advise all officers who have
not yet left for Rennes...

670
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:04,713
...to postpone their
departure until tomorrow.

671
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:07,757
May I remind you,general...

672
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,723
...that the Allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions.

673
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:16,027
North Africa,Sicily,Italy....

674
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:18,259
Yes,and always at dawn.

675
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:29,710
We're 11 minutes from the green light.

676
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:32,110
Now,once more,I repeat:

677
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:36,109
If,for any reason,we fail
to hit our drop zones...

678
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:38,219
...move north by east.

679
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:40,354
North by east.

680
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,387
The Germans have flooded large
swamp areas behind the coast.

681
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,791
Avoid them if possible.

682
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,897
We came here to fight,not to swim.

683
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:51,735
Do you read me?

684
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,235
Loud and clear,sir.

685
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:16,788
How'd you make out?

686
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:19,695
How did you make out at the game?

687
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:23,932
I lost.

688
01:00:26,138 --> 01:00:28,436
Now we're both jumping clean.

689
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:49,847
I understand. And when will
the field marshal return?

690
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:53,628
I see. Oh,well.

691
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,232
Just a moment.

692
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:58,629
The radar report.

693
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:05,636
We are getting reports of
strong radar interference...

694
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:08,476
...and radio reception is jammed.

695
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:14,974
I realize this has happened before,
but never this effectively!

696
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:16,950
And the--

697
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,488
Call the OB West? Very well.

698
01:01:21,026 --> 01:01:24,587
Give my respects to the field
marshal when he returns.

699
01:01:57,763 --> 01:02:02,188
Bye,Rupert. Do your duty
for God,king,and your country.

700
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:09,261
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!

701
01:03:10,636 --> 01:03:14,595
Forward! Board! Fast!

702
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,442
-Are we late?
-No,but...

703
01:04:34,686 --> 01:04:36,210
...we must hurry!

704
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:49,321
What is it?

705
01:05:56,668 --> 01:05:58,226
I'll go.

706
01:06:18,023 --> 01:06:19,047
Stop!

707
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,452
We said,stop!

708
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,851
Stop,or I'll shoot!

709
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:29,995
What are you doing here?

710
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:32,895
I live in that farm.

711
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:36,497
Nobody lives in that farm.

712
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:40,472
-It's abandoned.
-Show me your papers.

713
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,503
Hurry up!

714
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:50,315
Come with me.

715
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:51,983
Go on!

716
01:07:31,597 --> 01:07:33,588
Put your bicycle there.

717
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:35,727
Hans!

718
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:38,698
Hans,where are you?

719
01:07:40,038 --> 01:07:43,201
-What's going on here?
-Nothing!

720
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:46,198
Who is with you? I want to know!

721
01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:56,851
Stop!

722
01:07:57,289 --> 01:07:58,586
Stop!

723
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,732
Stop!

724
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:20,433
Stop! Stop!

725
01:09:09,027 --> 01:09:11,291
Good luck at the war games,general.

726
01:09:14,032 --> 01:09:15,795
Anything important?

727
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:19,856
Communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts.

728
01:09:21,206 --> 01:09:23,162
The Underground again!

729
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:28,467
Some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute.

730
01:09:29,047 --> 01:09:30,537
Rubber dummies!

731
01:09:32,384 --> 01:09:34,306
Connect me with General Richter!

732
01:09:34,553 --> 01:09:39,547
We can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics...

733
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,052
...but I don't like this idea
of dummy parachutists.

734
01:09:46,064 --> 01:09:49,830
Marcks speaking. Yes.

735
01:09:51,203 --> 01:09:53,694
Are you certain?

736
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,329
How many?

737
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,502
What do you think of it?

738
01:09:59,845 --> 01:10:02,541
Thank you,Richter.

739
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:08,135
Paratroopers reported here,
here and here!

740
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:12,522
Put it over there.

741
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:23,261
This is what they dropped,they
explode on contact with the earth.

742
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:26,025
In the dark,they look like soldiers.

743
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:31,504
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw,not real paratroopers.

744
01:10:40,619 --> 01:10:45,716
When you create a diversion,
it's for a reason.

745
01:10:45,924 --> 01:10:48,722
Connect me with General Pemsel!

746
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:54,257
Dummies...!

747
01:10:54,766 --> 01:10:56,393
Rubber dummies!

748
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:03,263
I agree with you,general.
I'll call you back.

749
01:11:05,644 --> 01:11:07,475
What about my call to von Rundstedt?

750
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,443
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.

751
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:13,038
Colonel Helmdach is trying
to re-route the call.

752
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:16,950
They wouldn't drop dummies...

753
01:11:17,155 --> 01:11:20,044
...unless it was to divert our
attention from something else.

754
01:11:20,258 --> 01:11:21,748
In this weather?

755
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,552
In any kind of weather!

756
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:26,753
I must get in touch with OB West.

757
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:23,912
They're enemy paratroopers!

758
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:40,057
Blimey,mate...

759
01:12:40,372 --> 01:12:43,364
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!

760
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:21,609
Fellas!

761
01:13:21,913 --> 01:13:23,574
I'm hung up!

762
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:25,307
Fellas!

763
01:13:36,928 --> 01:13:39,192
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

764
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:21,359
Where have you come from?

765
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:23,228
Awfully sorry,old man.

766
01:15:23,535 --> 01:15:25,662
Simply landed here by accident.

767
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:33,700
What's that?

768
01:15:34,546 --> 01:15:37,538
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.

769
01:15:37,749 --> 01:15:41,173
-Your what?
-My communion set. I've lost it.

770
01:15:41,553 --> 01:15:44,317
Now listen,padre.
We've got no time to look for--

771
01:15:50,895 --> 01:15:53,261
I'm sure that it was here
that I lost it.

772
01:16:13,084 --> 01:16:16,542
We're under fire,padre.
Don't you think we ought to--?

773
01:16:16,755 --> 01:16:20,418
You go on,my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.

774
01:16:22,594 --> 01:16:24,755
Cor! Stuff a grouse.

775
01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:31,065
I've got it! I've got it!

776
01:16:31,302 --> 01:16:33,065
Glory be.

777
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:37,092
Now,my son,let's go
about God's work this night.

778
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,618
Pluskat.

779
01:16:54,626 --> 01:16:56,890
Hello,Pluskat! Do you hear me?

780
01:17:00,632 --> 01:17:02,156
Nothing that I've heard....

781
01:17:04,435 --> 01:17:08,132
The usual bombing,but quite distant.

782
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,539
Oh,yes,I can hear it.

783
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:15,544
Well,wait a minute.

784
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,645
Yes,just a moment.

785
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:35,785
Flares,but a long way up the coast.

786
01:17:36,334 --> 01:17:39,360
Yes,Cherbourg is getting hit again.

787
01:17:39,838 --> 01:17:42,432
There's probably nothing to it...

788
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:47,702
...but we have had reports
of paratrooper landings.

789
01:17:47,946 --> 01:17:50,938
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.

790
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:53,381
Thank you,sir.

791
01:18:11,736 --> 01:18:13,966
Higher! Higher!

792
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:22,098
Louis,open your store.
We need more buckets!

793
01:18:27,352 --> 01:18:30,014
Mayor Renaud,you must
come with me immediately.

794
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:33,611
-Is it important?
-Very important,Mayor Renaud.

795
01:18:43,735 --> 01:18:45,259
What's wrong,madam?

796
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,027
I was on my way to the
little house outside....

797
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,704
Yes,yes,go on.

798
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,795
Suddenly,I saw a man
fall from the sky.

799
01:18:52,076 --> 01:18:53,941
-A parachutist?
-Yes,that's right.

800
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:55,773
He looked like a big white bird!

801
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:58,107
-British or German?
-What?

802
01:18:58,383 --> 01:19:00,715
The parachutist,was he
a friend or an enemy?

803
01:19:00,952 --> 01:19:04,581
I don't know. He disappeared
without a word. Just "Shh!"

804
01:19:04,923 --> 01:19:07,118
-Without a word?
-Just "Shh!"

805
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,028
Bonjour,madame...

806
01:19:17,435 --> 01:19:19,323
...je suis americain.

807
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:21,826
Bonjour,mademoiselle...

808
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,839
...je suis americain.

809
01:19:26,144 --> 01:19:28,066
We seem to be circling.

810
01:19:28,813 --> 01:19:32,078
Maybe they're having difficulty
finding the drop zone.

811
01:19:33,284 --> 01:19:34,581
Je suis...

812
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:36,184
...americain.

813
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:38,981
Je suis americain.

814
01:19:40,124 --> 01:19:41,614
Voulez-vous...

815
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:42,919
...mademoiselle?

816
01:19:44,796 --> 01:19:46,821
Okay.

817
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:48,329
Go!

818
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,362
Go!

819
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:54,766
Go! Go! Go!

820
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,096
Paratroopers!

821
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:34,170
Paratroop groups.
Those are paratroop groups!

822
01:23:46,837 --> 01:23:48,065
Anything new?

823
01:23:48,306 --> 01:23:52,299
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual,sir...

824
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,940
...and now near Caen.

825
01:23:55,179 --> 01:23:57,875
The lines to Stations 6
and 8 have been cut...

826
01:23:58,082 --> 01:24:00,209
...but the direct line is open.

827
01:24:18,569 --> 01:24:20,434
I'll stay for a while.

828
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:25,204
-Would you like coffee?
-Yes,thank you.

829
01:25:06,784 --> 01:25:09,412
For God's sakes,padre,
stop that damn noise.

830
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:12,248
I'm sorry,son. I'm afraid I'm lost.

831
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:14,117
Well,who ain't? Now,come on.

832
01:26:08,646 --> 01:26:09,704
Two clicks.

833
01:26:10,014 --> 01:26:12,073
I heard two clicks.

834
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,410
Man...

835
01:27:54,618 --> 01:27:56,540
...am I glad to see you.

836
01:27:57,321 --> 01:28:00,347
-You guys the 82nd?
-No. This is the 101.

837
01:28:00,624 --> 01:28:01,921
101?

838
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:03,423
Where's the 82nd?

839
01:28:03,627 --> 01:28:06,960
Look,bud,we don't even know
where our own outfit is.

840
01:28:08,165 --> 01:28:10,690
Well,somebody's shooting
at somebody.

841
01:28:10,935 --> 01:28:12,425
Let's us go find this war.

842
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:13,967
Come on.

843
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:47,033
Maybe they're Limeys
and ain't got no cricket.

844
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,731
They must be our guys.

845
01:28:55,312 --> 01:28:56,745
Okay.

846
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:20,495
No.

847
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,282
Hey.

848
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:40,016
Hey,they were Germans.

849
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:54,697
Hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right.

850
01:29:54,905 --> 01:29:56,566
Toward Caen.

851
01:29:57,241 --> 01:29:59,106
Yes.

852
01:29:59,543 --> 01:30:04,742
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula.
Something must be happening!

853
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:10,181
But what,Pluskat,what?
I haven't the faintest idea.

854
01:30:12,056 --> 01:30:15,753
Has anything been
observed on the beaches?

855
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:20,092
No,nothing.

856
01:30:21,131 --> 01:30:23,463
Yes,I'll let you know right away.

857
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:25,064
Of course.

858
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:35,101
Are you positive that ankle's broken?

859
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:36,974
Compound fracture,sir.

860
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:41,342
Well,put the boot back on
and lace it up,tight.

861
01:30:41,585 --> 01:30:43,314
Don't get mad,I didn't break it.

862
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,317
And you're not walking on it.

863
01:30:45,522 --> 01:30:49,845
-You're not going to try--
-Knock it off and do as you're told.

864
01:31:01,138 --> 01:31:02,162
Yes?

865
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:05,604
A,B and C Company are scattered
all over like we are.

866
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:07,140
Go on.

867
01:31:07,344 --> 01:31:11,474
Conklin landed on a stone wall,broke
his shoulder. I left him with a medic.

868
01:31:11,682 --> 01:31:13,309
Any contact with F Company?

869
01:31:13,517 --> 01:31:17,544
No,but they must be up ahead

870
01:31:18,622 --> 01:31:22,114
Well,go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.

871
01:31:26,497 --> 01:31:28,124
Well,here's where we are.

872
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:30,254
The northern edge
of the swamp area...

873
01:31:30,467 --> 01:31:32,332
...five miles from our drop zone.

874
01:31:32,536 --> 01:31:34,367
Five miles.

875
01:31:35,172 --> 01:31:36,264
-F Company?
-No,sir.

876
01:31:36,473 --> 01:31:38,634
And we've got scouts
all over the place.

877
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:40,867
We even picked up a group
from the 101.

878
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:45,037
F Company were the first
of the lead planes.

879
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,880
Well,give me a hand.

880
01:31:57,361 --> 01:31:59,090
Can I have my rifle?

881
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:11,537
Well,we'll head out this way.

882
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:16,572
We ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak.

883
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:19,345
All right. Have the men spread out...

884
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:21,506
...pick up any stragglers
they can find.

885
01:32:21,685 --> 01:32:23,118
-Pass the word.
-Right,sir.

886
01:32:23,387 --> 01:32:26,311
All right,men,spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.

887
01:32:26,523 --> 01:32:28,184
Pass the word down.

888
01:32:29,893 --> 01:32:31,258
All right...

889
01:32:31,595 --> 01:32:32,857
...let's go.

890
01:32:34,565 --> 01:32:38,092
From the latest reports,
this is how I see it:

891
01:32:38,335 --> 01:32:41,395
American paratroopers have landed....

892
01:32:42,506 --> 01:32:44,531
...here.

893
01:32:45,242 --> 01:32:46,766
British paratroopers here.

894
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:50,740
The invasion....

895
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:53,873
...here.

896
01:32:57,988 --> 01:33:00,115
Yes. Thank you,Pemsel.

897
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:04,655
General Pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion.

898
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:09,786
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:

899
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:13,423
Normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack.

900
01:33:13,637 --> 01:33:15,935
A diversionary attack,Blumentritt.

901
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:20,167
It's not the main attack. That will
come at the Pas-de-Calais...

902
01:33:20,978 --> 01:33:22,775
...where it was always expected.

903
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:28,247
Where we always expected it.

904
01:33:28,986 --> 01:33:31,477
But we can't take any chances.

905
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:34,917
I want the reserve panzers
moved up at once!

906
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:38,083
We need approval from the
F¨¹hrer's headquarters.

907
01:33:38,328 --> 01:33:41,126
They wouldn't dare refuse me!

908
01:33:41,431 --> 01:33:46,459
Call the F¨¹hrer's headquarters
and insist.

909
01:33:46,670 --> 01:33:51,164
Insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately!

910
01:33:56,013 --> 01:34:01,701
An invasion of Normandy would
be against all military logic.

911
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,844
It would really be against all logic.

912
01:34:17,379 --> 01:34:20,007
Well,that about covers it,gentlemen.

913
01:34:23,152 --> 01:34:25,643
Most of you have had
your feet wet before:

914
01:34:26,155 --> 01:34:28,749
Dunkirk,Dieppe,Norway.

915
01:34:28,957 --> 01:34:31,812
And we know what it means
to be driven into the sea.

916
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:34,988
In a few hours
we're going back from the sea.

917
01:34:36,665 --> 01:34:38,826
And this time we're going to stay.

918
01:34:40,269 --> 01:34:42,294
There's no time
for any sob stuff about...

919
01:34:42,504 --> 01:34:44,802
...England,home and beauty.

920
01:34:46,408 --> 01:34:50,174
Remember,our people have had a
rough time for four and a half years.

921
01:34:51,513 --> 01:34:53,674
They've earned the final victory.

922
01:34:55,884 --> 01:34:57,511
Let's give it to them.

923
01:34:58,787 --> 01:35:01,779
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:

924
01:35:02,024 --> 01:35:03,582
Good luck.

925
01:35:03,825 --> 01:35:05,816
Tomorrow morning,we'll take them.

926
01:35:15,237 --> 01:35:16,727
Come in,Teddy.
That will be all,sergeant.

927
01:35:27,049 --> 01:35:28,880
Did you have to put it in writing?

928
01:35:29,218 --> 01:35:31,550
I knew you wouldn't let me go
unless I did.

929
01:35:31,753 --> 01:35:33,812
You're putting me on the spot.

930
01:35:34,022 --> 01:35:36,616
-I didn't mean to,Tubby.
-The hell you didn't.

931
01:35:36,858 --> 01:35:39,622
You put that request in writing,
made it official.

932
01:35:39,861 --> 01:35:42,421
You're the assistant division
commander.

933
01:35:42,731 --> 01:35:45,928
And that's why I'm supposed to go
ashore in the first wave.

934
01:35:46,235 --> 01:35:48,931
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.

935
01:35:49,238 --> 01:35:50,830
You're important
to this operation.

936
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:53,701
We can't have you knocked off
on the first day.

937
01:35:53,909 --> 01:35:56,241
But that's not the real reason.

938
01:35:56,445 --> 01:36:00,074
Isn't it because my father was
president of the United States?

939
01:36:00,349 --> 01:36:01,748
And a great president.

940
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:03,747
And a great soldier.

941
01:36:03,952 --> 01:36:07,217
He led the charge of the Rough Riders
up San Juan Hill.

942
01:36:08,257 --> 01:36:11,852
So now you've got to be
the first man ashore on Utah Beach.

943
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,791
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.

944
01:36:21,903 --> 01:36:25,930
Also,I've been there side by side
with the men all through training.

945
01:36:26,141 --> 01:36:30,271
They're used to seeing me there.
They have a right to expect me there.

946
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:33,107
President's son or not.

947
01:36:35,784 --> 01:36:37,615
Is my request denied?

948
01:36:49,998 --> 01:36:51,886
No,you know it's not.

949
01:36:53,635 --> 01:36:56,934
Request reluctantly approved.

950
01:36:59,007 --> 01:37:00,531
Thanks,Tubby.

951
01:37:02,311 --> 01:37:03,539
Thanks a lot.

952
01:37:05,047 --> 01:37:06,139
Say...

953
01:37:06,348 --> 01:37:08,441
...how's that arthritis of yours?

954
01:37:08,984 --> 01:37:10,645
Arthritis?

955
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,811
Haven't had a touch in months.

956
01:37:14,022 --> 01:37:15,353
Glad to hear it.

957
01:37:34,343 --> 01:37:35,537
The street...

958
01:37:36,845 --> 01:37:38,142
...the bridge...

959
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:40,447
...the hotel...

960
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:43,841
...the casino.

961
01:37:46,855 --> 01:37:48,618
That's it,gentlemen.

962
01:37:58,367 --> 01:37:59,664
One more thing....

963
01:38:01,536 --> 01:38:04,528
You have been fighting
everywhere for four years...

964
01:38:04,873 --> 01:38:10,106
...in Abyssinia,Libya,Egypt,Crete....

965
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:15,240
But this time you are going
to fight on French soil...

966
01:38:15,884 --> 01:38:17,408
...in our fields...

967
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,010
...in our villages...

968
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:23,921
...under the eyes of our own people.

969
01:38:27,763 --> 01:38:31,358
I can't wake the F¨¹hrer on
the strength of contradictory reports.

970
01:38:31,533 --> 01:38:35,128
He was up till four.
He took a sedative and then retired.

971
01:38:35,404 --> 01:38:37,895
I won't wake him for these reports.

972
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:43,066
First we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews.

973
01:38:43,278 --> 01:38:46,406
Next they are identified
as mechanical dummies.

974
01:38:46,615 --> 01:38:50,506
If these reports are true
and paratroopers have landed...

975
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,416
...it can only be a commando raid.

976
01:38:54,623 --> 01:38:59,219
Is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast?

977
01:38:59,561 --> 01:39:04,658
I will submit all reports to the
F¨¹hrer as soon as he awakens.

978
01:39:05,667 --> 01:39:07,430
I understand.

979
01:39:09,438 --> 01:39:11,269
JodI has turned us down.

980
01:39:13,942 --> 01:39:18,572
He will not release the panzers
without the F¨¹hrer's approval...

981
01:39:21,116 --> 01:39:24,074
...and the Fuhrer is still asleep!

982
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,815
Will you tell von Rundstedt?

983
01:39:31,193 --> 01:39:32,785
No,not now....

984
01:39:35,163 --> 01:39:36,960
Not now.

985
01:39:38,467 --> 01:39:40,196
Thank you,gentlemen.

986
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:59,074
Sit down.

987
01:40:01,089 --> 01:40:03,319
This is history.

988
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,823
We are living a historical moment.

989
01:40:10,332 --> 01:40:11,822
We are going to lose the war...

990
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,858
...because the glorious F¨¹hrer
has taken a sleeping pill...

991
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,963
...and is not to be awakened.

992
01:40:22,043 --> 01:40:24,136
It's unbelievable.

993
01:40:24,346 --> 01:40:25,973
Think of it,Kurt.

994
01:40:27,682 --> 01:40:29,843
Don't ever forget it.

995
01:40:31,019 --> 01:40:33,977
We are witnessing something...

996
01:40:34,256 --> 01:40:38,352
...which historians will always
say is completely improbable...

997
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,255
...and yet it is true.

998
01:40:43,832 --> 01:40:46,824
The Fuhrer is not to be awakened!

999
01:40:47,836 --> 01:40:51,260
I sometimes wonder
whose side God is on.

1000
01:40:53,575 --> 01:40:54,633
Can I...

1001
01:40:55,944 --> 01:40:58,003
...bring you anything,sir?

1002
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:05,445
In my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac...

1003
01:41:05,654 --> 01:41:08,282
...Napoleon,unopened.

1004
01:41:09,157 --> 01:41:12,285
I was even saving it for
a fitting occasion.

1005
01:41:13,328 --> 01:41:18,118
This isn't exactly the right
occasion,but get it anyway.

1006
01:41:43,658 --> 01:41:45,353
Daylight at last.

1007
01:41:47,929 --> 01:41:50,762
A whole night wasted again!

1008
01:41:58,473 --> 01:41:59,667
Where's my dog?

1009
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:01,966
He was here a minute ago.

1010
01:42:07,716 --> 01:42:09,513
Let's have one last look.

1011
01:42:13,154 --> 01:42:14,917
Nothing.

1012
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:17,285
Not even a seagull....

1013
01:42:27,035 --> 01:42:28,332
My God!

1014
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:36,443
The invasion.

1015
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:39,344
They're coming!

1016
01:42:39,814 --> 01:42:41,805
Everyone to your posts!

1017
01:42:43,485 --> 01:42:48,218
It's the invasion! There must be
5000 ships out there!

1018
01:42:48,823 --> 01:42:51,314
Get hold of yourself,Pluskat.

1019
01:42:53,128 --> 01:42:56,518
The enemy doesn't have
even half that many.

1020
01:42:56,998 --> 01:43:00,923
Well,damn it! Come and see
for yourself,you fool!

1021
01:43:02,003 --> 01:43:03,561
It's amazing.

1022
01:43:03,838 --> 01:43:06,227
It's beyond belief.

1023
01:43:07,542 --> 01:43:11,239
My dear Pluskat,where are
these ships heading?

1024
01:43:11,513 --> 01:43:13,105
SStraight for me!

1025
01:43:29,064 --> 01:43:31,760
General,in exactly two minutes...

1026
01:43:32,033 --> 01:43:34,160
...the fleet will open fire.

1027
01:43:35,036 --> 01:43:38,733
Your attention,please.
The admiral has an announcement.

1028
01:43:42,043 --> 01:43:46,002
Soon we will have the honor
to be engaged in battle.

1029
01:43:47,082 --> 01:43:52,008
To drive the enemy out,we must
fire on our homeland.

1030
01:43:52,887 --> 01:43:55,082
This is the price of liberty.

1031
01:43:56,191 --> 01:43:57,522
Long live France!

1032
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:29,950
There he goes,right on time,as usual.

1033
01:45:20,742 --> 01:45:24,974
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!

1034
01:45:33,521 --> 01:45:35,682
I'm not crazy.
Look,they're landing!

1035
01:45:35,924 --> 01:45:38,256
The Americans,the English
and the French!

1036
01:46:14,195 --> 01:46:18,586
Do you hear me? What's the matter
with you? What's going on?

1037
01:46:18,933 --> 01:46:21,595
You must be deaf! Can't you...

1038
01:46:22,737 --> 01:46:26,298
Damn it,can't you hear
it for yourself?

1039
01:46:29,777 --> 01:46:33,941
We're under fire. Yes,under fire!

1040
01:46:39,287 --> 01:46:43,951
Those 5000 ships you
say the Allies haven't got...

1041
01:46:44,292 --> 01:46:47,284
...well,they've got them!

1042
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,569
It's wonderful!

1043
01:47:20,094 --> 01:47:21,982
Yes? What is it now?

1044
01:47:22,196 --> 01:47:23,686
Listen to me,Pips.

1045
01:47:23,898 --> 01:47:28,323
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!

1046
01:47:28,603 --> 01:47:32,334
What the hell can I do
with only two planes?

1047
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,029
Where are the others,you idiots?!

1048
01:47:35,476 --> 01:47:40,004
Priller,that's an order! Get
ready at once! Understand?

1049
01:47:40,214 --> 01:47:43,138
If it isn't too much trouble...

1050
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:47,674
...would you tell me where
the invasion is?

1051
01:47:48,856 --> 01:47:51,848
What? Normandy! How delightful!

1052
01:47:52,126 --> 01:47:56,415
Thanks,my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!

1053
01:47:57,131 --> 01:48:00,692
It's getting very difficult to
get any sleep around here.

1054
01:48:03,404 --> 01:48:08,694
Your prospects for a long sleep are
excellent. The invasion has begun.

1055
01:48:09,085 --> 01:48:13,175
Normandy.
We're flying there,the two of us.

1056
01:48:14,349 --> 01:48:16,078
Nobody else is left.

1057
01:48:18,152 --> 01:48:19,881
I don't think we're coming back.

1058
01:49:16,878 --> 01:49:21,804
Move out! Move out!

1059
01:49:32,093 --> 01:49:33,822
The shelling has stopped.

1060
01:49:37,465 --> 01:49:38,762
Landing craft approaching.

1061
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,357
Return to headquarters. Direct
your troops from there!

1062
01:49:43,905 --> 01:49:45,964
Landing craft approaching the coast!

1063
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:53,545
Those French bastards!

1064
01:49:53,781 --> 01:49:55,669
Sergeant!

1065
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:59,182
Send this to headquarters by courier.

1066
01:50:00,922 --> 01:50:05,052
No! Take it yourself. Tell
them our lines are cut!

1067
01:50:05,293 --> 01:50:07,249
Gentlemen,come here please.

1068
01:50:08,463 --> 01:50:10,658
Attack!

1069
01:50:10,932 --> 01:50:12,593
Fast!

1070
01:50:14,302 --> 01:50:16,634
Take your positions!

1071
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,333
Take your positions!

1072
01:50:24,112 --> 01:50:26,603
Don't let them get too close!

1073
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:30,278
Fast!

1074
01:50:30,451 --> 01:50:32,248
Attack!

1075
01:50:47,969 --> 01:50:51,666
There it is,men.
Omaha Beach,dead ahead.

1076
01:50:52,607 --> 01:50:53,869
Lock on the target!

1077
01:50:56,744 --> 01:50:58,507
Stand by!

1078
01:52:03,544 --> 01:52:05,774
Get off of the beach!

1079
01:52:06,047 --> 01:52:07,810
Let's go!

1080
01:52:52,593 --> 01:52:53,719
Come on,move up!

1081
01:53:12,713 --> 01:53:13,737
Hello,general,sir.

1082
01:53:13,981 --> 01:53:17,007
-Are you all right,boy?
-Yes,sir.

1083
01:53:17,218 --> 01:53:20,346
Don't you think you better go
back and get your rifle?

1084
01:53:20,621 --> 01:53:21,883
Out there,sir?

1085
01:53:22,123 --> 01:53:25,012
You're almost sure to need it
before this day is over.

1086
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,451
Yes,sir.

1087
01:53:43,244 --> 01:53:46,077
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.

1088
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:55,753
Medic! Medic!

1089
01:54:16,677 --> 01:54:19,510
General,first reports
from Omaha,sir.

1090
01:54:19,714 --> 01:54:21,045
"Assault teams have landed.

1091
01:54:21,248 --> 01:54:24,081
No direct radio contact,
but destroyers report...

1092
01:54:24,285 --> 01:54:27,413
...first and second waves
appear pinned down on the beach.

1093
01:54:27,688 --> 01:54:30,543
Concentrated artillery
and mortar fire.

1094
01:54:30,758 --> 01:54:34,524
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties,sir.

1095
01:55:33,354 --> 01:55:35,686
When the mortars and machine guns
are silenced...

1096
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:39,587
...have the battalion commanders
join me over there.

1097
01:55:39,827 --> 01:55:40,987
Okay.

1098
01:55:41,262 --> 01:55:43,594
Hang on to that map case,Eddie.

1099
01:56:13,794 --> 01:56:15,022
I made it.

1100
01:56:17,565 --> 01:56:18,862
Hey,I made it.

1101
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,131
Did you see me get those two guys?

1102
01:56:22,837 --> 01:56:24,270
Hey,sergeant?

1103
01:56:28,375 --> 01:56:29,740
Sergeant?

1104
01:56:31,912 --> 01:56:35,643
As best as I can figure it,
this is the wrong beach.

1105
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,581
We're a mile and a quarter south
of where we were supposed to land.

1106
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:41,515
We should be up there.

1107
01:56:41,822 --> 01:56:44,882
Control boat must've been confused
by the naval bombardment smoke.

1108
01:56:45,326 --> 01:56:47,248
I agree with you,
but what will we do now?

1109
01:56:47,428 --> 01:56:51,023
Reinforcements and heavy equipment
will approach in a very few minutes.

1110
01:56:51,198 --> 01:56:54,292
-I know,I know.
-What if they land at the right beach?

1111
01:57:03,844 --> 01:57:07,109
The reinforcements will have to
follow us wherever we are.

1112
01:57:08,849 --> 01:57:10,714
We're starting the war from right here.

1113
01:57:11,852 --> 01:57:14,878
-Head inland. We're going inland.
-Okay,let's go.

1114
01:57:32,907 --> 01:57:35,432
Follow me. Do everything I do!

1115
01:57:39,146 --> 01:57:41,569
All right. Let's go!

1116
01:58:27,628 --> 01:58:29,960
Head for home!

1117
01:58:31,532 --> 01:58:34,888
The Luftwaffe has had
its great moment!

1118
01:58:45,145 --> 01:58:46,510
Stand by to beach.

1119
01:58:46,714 --> 01:58:48,773
Duncan,take care of that strongpoint.

1120
01:58:49,350 --> 01:58:52,342
Any minute now. Stand by!

1121
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,781
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!

1122
01:58:55,289 --> 01:58:57,985
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it,Clough?

1123
01:58:58,192 --> 01:59:00,217
Sure he was at school at the time.

1124
01:59:02,696 --> 01:59:04,789
Come on,you bums!

1125
01:59:05,633 --> 01:59:09,524
Come out,you dirty slobs!
Flanagan's back!

1126
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:15,664
The evil of it all. Drowning a man
before he fights.

1127
01:59:15,843 --> 01:59:17,174
Oh,come on!

1128
01:59:52,846 --> 01:59:55,337
Keep those vehicles moving!

1129
01:59:55,549 --> 01:59:59,144
MP,chase out those cyclists.

1130
01:59:59,353 --> 02:00:00,980
Get off the beach!

1131
02:00:01,188 --> 02:00:03,110
Move inland!

1132
02:00:05,926 --> 02:00:07,291
Come on,you lot!

1133
02:00:07,494 --> 02:00:08,984
Hurry it up.

1134
02:00:12,433 --> 02:00:14,128
Never mind the blathering!

1135
02:00:14,368 --> 02:00:16,290
We must put these down somewhere.

1136
02:00:16,503 --> 02:00:18,368
The sooner you get off the beach...

1137
02:00:18,572 --> 02:00:21,405
...the sooner they'll stop
this blasted shelling.

1138
02:00:21,709 --> 02:00:23,631
It's very bad for the dog!

1139
02:00:26,313 --> 02:00:28,144
Down,Winston,down!

1140
02:00:29,216 --> 02:00:31,810
Beach Master Sword,Section 2-A.

1141
02:00:32,019 --> 02:00:35,318
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.

1142
02:00:35,522 --> 02:00:37,114
Standing by.

1143
02:00:38,525 --> 02:00:40,083
Get going!

1144
02:00:40,461 --> 02:00:43,123
For heaven's sake,
get that carrier off the beach!

1145
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:46,493
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your radio.

1146
02:00:46,734 --> 02:00:49,191
If you can't drive it,carry it!

1147
02:00:50,003 --> 02:00:51,197
You were saying?

1148
02:00:51,405 --> 02:00:54,033
I was told I could transmit
a newsflash on your--

1149
02:00:54,241 --> 02:00:57,506
My dear fellow,I don't want
to appear uncooperative--

1150
02:00:57,778 --> 02:01:00,338
Yes,I know all about
the power of the press.

1151
02:01:00,547 --> 02:01:04,176
But this line happens
to be rather busy! Come on!

1152
02:01:08,288 --> 02:01:10,017
Down,Winston. Down,Winston.

1153
02:01:12,993 --> 02:01:14,187
What did he say?

1154
02:01:14,461 --> 02:01:16,122
The answer is no.

1155
02:01:16,363 --> 02:01:18,160
We have to use the damn pigeons.

1156
02:01:18,365 --> 02:01:20,060
I've got these ready.

1157
02:01:20,634 --> 02:01:22,226
Here,clip this on.

1158
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:38,474
They're going the wrong way.

1159
02:01:38,786 --> 02:01:40,674
Not toward the Germans,you idiots!

1160
02:01:40,888 --> 02:01:44,016
The other way! The other way!

1161
02:01:44,291 --> 02:01:45,952
Damned traitors!

1162
02:01:46,293 --> 02:01:48,853
-Hold it.
-Can't you get your finger out?

1163
02:01:49,062 --> 02:01:51,758
-What's the matter?
-Engine won't start,sir.

1164
02:01:51,965 --> 02:01:53,592
Full of seawater,I think.

1165
02:01:55,068 --> 02:01:56,660
My old grandmother used to say...

1166
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:59,566
...anything mechanical,
give it a good bash.

1167
02:02:00,174 --> 02:02:02,404
Try it now.

1168
02:02:04,578 --> 02:02:05,602
Thank you,sir.

1169
02:02:05,846 --> 02:02:07,336
Off you go. Good luck.

1170
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:13,616
I'm sure that got it out.

1171
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:17,750
That's what I call a hell of a man!

1172
02:02:17,991 --> 02:02:20,186
Aye,I like his dog too.

1173
02:02:21,328 --> 02:02:23,023
Don't stand there yapping!

1174
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:25,992
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!

1175
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:29,593
Come along!

1176
02:02:29,837 --> 02:02:31,065
Come on!

1177
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:34,872
-Thank you.
-Everything's going according to plan.

1178
02:02:35,075 --> 02:02:38,374
Stand by to move.
Millin,"Blue Bonnet."

1179
02:02:49,556 --> 02:02:51,751
What in God's name...

1180
02:02:55,929 --> 02:02:59,717
Oh,my friends. What a day!
What a day!

1181
02:03:00,067 --> 02:03:02,297
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!

1182
02:03:02,569 --> 02:03:04,662
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you--

1183
02:03:04,938 --> 02:03:07,065
Look at this. I kept it for you all.

1184
02:03:07,274 --> 02:03:10,107
But I don't think there
will be enough for everyone.

1185
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:14,406
Perhaps next time. We have
a previous engagement:the war!

1186
02:03:15,415 --> 02:03:17,076
Mustn't lose that champagne!

1187
02:03:17,317 --> 02:03:20,445
All right,men,fall in!
Millin,"Blue Bonnet."

1188
02:03:22,089 --> 02:03:23,420
Goodbye.

1189
02:03:25,092 --> 02:03:27,925
Thank you,boys! Thank you!

1190
02:03:33,667 --> 02:03:36,431
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!

1191
02:03:37,638 --> 02:03:38,935
If you ask me,Flanagan...

1192
02:03:39,139 --> 02:03:42,597
...there's a lot of very
peculiar blokes on this beach.

1193
02:03:43,977 --> 02:03:45,501
Welcome!

1194
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:48,075
Welcome to you all!

1195
02:05:39,726 --> 02:05:42,957
Thank you,dear,they're lovely!

1196
02:05:45,065 --> 02:05:47,727
Better try them on first.

1197
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:53,729
Rommel speaking.

1198
02:05:53,907 --> 02:05:55,340
Good morning.

1199
02:05:56,276 --> 02:05:57,641
What?

1200
02:05:58,278 --> 02:05:59,643
What!

1201
02:06:00,313 --> 02:06:01,712
Where?

1202
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:03,207
Normandy!

1203
02:06:04,251 --> 02:06:06,481
Have they a foothold already?

1204
02:06:07,054 --> 02:06:09,614
They must be thrown back!

1205
02:06:10,223 --> 02:06:12,316
What about the panzer reserves?

1206
02:06:13,427 --> 02:06:16,783
Did von Rundstedt obtain
their release from the F¨¹hrer?

1207
02:06:28,275 --> 02:06:32,871
Normandy,Normandy.

1208
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,541
How stupid of me!

1209
02:06:36,216 --> 02:06:37,615
Stupid.

1210
02:06:52,031 --> 02:06:53,430
There it is.

1211
02:07:04,811 --> 02:07:07,473
You mean to tell me
that's all we gotta climb?

1212
02:07:07,714 --> 02:07:09,944
They're not as high
as the practice ones.

1213
02:07:10,183 --> 02:07:11,946
They wasn't shooting at us then.

1214
02:07:13,553 --> 02:07:15,942
Why can't the Air Force
or Navy do this job?

1215
02:07:16,189 --> 02:07:19,955
The big guns in bunkers behind the
cliff can't be seen from the air.

1216
02:07:20,193 --> 02:07:23,424
We knock them out or they'll
murder our guys on the beach.

1217
02:07:23,696 --> 02:07:25,391
Yeah,well,if you ask me...

1218
02:07:25,698 --> 02:07:28,553
...three grandmothers with brooms
could sweep us off there...

1219
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:30,724
...like flies off of a sugar cake.

1220
02:14:06,098 --> 02:14:07,963
That's it,the one we're after.

1221
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:06,289
It's empty.

1222
02:15:06,759 --> 02:15:10,183
The Air Force and Navy
really plastered this baby.

1223
02:15:10,396 --> 02:15:11,795
But I don't get--

1224
02:15:12,732 --> 02:15:14,097
The guns.

1225
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,392
There ain't no mounts.

1226
02:15:17,236 --> 02:15:19,397
They've never even been installed.

1227
02:15:20,773 --> 02:15:21,967
You mean...

1228
02:15:22,875 --> 02:15:25,799
...we come up all this way...

1229
02:15:26,045 --> 02:15:27,603
...for nothing?

1230
02:15:32,685 --> 02:15:34,812
Don't worry,sarge,
you'll be all right.

1231
02:15:35,054 --> 02:15:37,318
Medic! Medic!

1232
02:15:46,298 --> 02:15:48,721
I wonder what "bitte,bitte" means.

1233
02:15:59,211 --> 02:16:02,942
What the hell are you
wearing a life preserver for?

1234
02:16:03,516 --> 02:16:05,313
I can't swim.

1235
02:16:13,426 --> 02:16:17,954
Normandy. It really is Normandy.

1236
02:16:18,764 --> 02:16:22,723
This is madness,madness,
sheer madness!

1237
02:16:24,236 --> 02:16:25,965
What is it?

1238
02:16:26,272 --> 02:16:30,504
I just talked to General Jodl,
the F¨¹hrer is awake.

1239
02:16:30,743 --> 02:16:36,306
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?

1240
02:16:37,249 --> 02:16:41,640
The F¨¹hrer went into
one of his tantrums...

1241
02:16:42,254 --> 02:16:45,018
...and no one dared
bring up the subject.

1242
02:16:45,558 --> 02:16:47,753
They're still held in reserve!

1243
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:50,487
Yes,field marshal.

1244
02:16:54,033 --> 02:16:56,524
Sir,if you would call
the F¨¹hrer yourself...

1245
02:16:56,902 --> 02:17:00,258
...I am convinced he would
respect your views.

1246
02:17:00,539 --> 02:17:02,063
Call him?

1247
02:17:02,308 --> 02:17:05,163
Call that Bohemian corporal?!

1248
02:17:06,078 --> 02:17:09,468
Crawl on my knees to him?!

1249
02:17:10,082 --> 02:17:12,778
No! It is out of the question!

1250
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:21,885
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."

1251
02:17:22,328 --> 02:17:23,386
What's that?

1252
02:17:23,662 --> 02:17:26,927
Nothing,nothing of importance.

1253
02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:30,529
Here,let me help you.

1254
02:17:31,804 --> 02:17:34,898
You all right,Tom?
Come on,they're up there.

1255
02:17:39,311 --> 02:17:41,108
-Sir.
-Well?

1256
02:17:41,413 --> 02:17:44,746
Mr. Smith says to tell you
he's stood his men too.

1257
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:47,111
The Jerries are moving up
into the woods...

1258
02:17:47,386 --> 02:17:49,308
...with machine guns and mortars.

1259
02:17:50,189 --> 02:17:53,215
-Tell the men to stand firm!
-Tell the chaps--

1260
02:17:53,425 --> 02:17:56,519
Tell them to expect another
counterattack,a heavy one.

1261
02:18:00,933 --> 02:18:02,958
-Here you are,mate.
-Ta.

1262
02:18:06,972 --> 02:18:08,701
-What's the matter?
-Listen.

1263
02:18:08,874 --> 02:18:10,762
I thought I heard bagpipes.

1264
02:18:10,976 --> 02:18:12,841
Don't be daft!

1265
02:18:21,620 --> 02:18:24,714
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.

1266
02:18:38,871 --> 02:18:39,929
It's Lovat!

1267
02:18:47,913 --> 02:18:49,244
Come on!

1268
02:18:49,882 --> 02:18:51,281
Come on!

1269
02:19:18,277 --> 02:19:20,404
-Sorry I'm late.
-Better than never,sir.

1270
02:19:20,613 --> 02:19:22,012
Glad to see you,Shimmy.

1271
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:29,916
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?

1272
02:19:30,122 --> 02:19:33,046
Jerry's regrouping in the woods,
about a mile.

1273
02:19:33,425 --> 02:19:35,188
With mortars and machine guns.

1274
02:19:35,427 --> 02:19:36,485
Numbers?

1275
02:19:36,662 --> 02:19:40,428
No idea,Shimmy,but they seem
to be moving forward in force.

1276
02:19:42,301 --> 02:19:43,928
In that case,we won't wait.

1277
02:19:44,703 --> 02:19:46,136
We'd better get moving.

1278
02:19:46,805 --> 02:19:48,693
All right,we're going across.

1279
02:19:48,941 --> 02:19:50,135
-Millin!
-Sir?

1280
02:19:50,976 --> 02:19:52,568
"Black Bear," sir.

1281
02:19:53,045 --> 02:19:55,309
All right,come on.

1282
02:19:55,514 --> 02:19:57,004
Everybody up!

1283
02:19:57,483 --> 02:19:58,973
On your feet!

1284
02:20:05,324 --> 02:20:08,452
There he goes. He's at it again.

1285
02:20:08,827 --> 02:20:11,557
Ever hear such a bleeding racket
in all your life?

1286
02:20:11,764 --> 02:20:14,528
Yeah,it takes an Irishman
to play the pipes.

1287
02:20:30,115 --> 02:20:32,276
Hold until relieved.

1288
02:20:32,518 --> 02:20:34,247
Hold until relieved.

1289
02:20:36,689 --> 02:20:41,513
North by east,north by east.
Sainte-M¨¨re-Eglise is that way.

1290
02:20:41,994 --> 02:20:43,882
Somebody turned that sign around.

1291
02:20:44,163 --> 02:20:47,792
Doesn't anybody in this outfit
look at a compass besides me?

1292
02:20:48,233 --> 02:20:49,564
Hey,you guys!

1293
02:20:49,802 --> 02:20:53,499
Over here! Over here!

1294
02:20:54,673 --> 02:20:56,698
Over here,on the double.

1295
02:20:59,378 --> 02:21:01,710
-Where you taking that?
-We don't know,sir.

1296
02:21:02,014 --> 02:21:03,777
We took the wrong road.

1297
02:21:04,683 --> 02:21:06,412
What do you got in here,ammo?

1298
02:21:06,685 --> 02:21:07,947
Yes,sir.

1299
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:11,050
-You 82nd?
-No,sir,101.

1300
02:21:11,256 --> 02:21:13,918
Well,you're in the 82nd now.

1301
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:17,153
-But,sir,we're--
-But what?

1302
02:21:17,396 --> 02:21:18,761
Nothing,sir.

1303
02:21:19,698 --> 02:21:21,529
All right,move out.

1304
02:21:25,204 --> 02:21:27,434
-Knock that sign down!
-Yes,sir.

1305
02:21:33,779 --> 02:21:37,601
-Something's moving up there,colonel.
-Hit the dirt! Take cover.

1306
02:21:40,819 --> 02:21:42,775
Lieutenant Sheen,sir,A Company.

1307
02:21:45,224 --> 02:21:47,419
Colonel,it's me!

1308
02:21:49,862 --> 02:21:52,285
-Where did you come from?
-Sainte-M¨¨re-Eglise.

1309
02:21:52,564 --> 02:21:55,260
We hold the main road
and north side of the square.

1310
02:21:55,501 --> 02:21:58,629
The Germans have a battery
on the other side of the town...

1311
02:21:58,837 --> 02:22:01,362
-...and command the countryside.
-And Major Lance?

1312
02:22:01,607 --> 02:22:05,304
-Holed up in a building in the square.
-F Company?

1313
02:22:06,011 --> 02:22:09,674
They overshot the drop zone
and landed in the middle of the town.

1314
02:22:09,882 --> 02:22:10,940
Go on.

1315
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:14,014
It was a nightmare,sir. A slaughter.

1316
02:22:14,286 --> 02:22:16,880
They were mowed down
before they hit the ground.

1317
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:23,888
Major Lance sent me to try
and contact you,sir.

1318
02:22:24,129 --> 02:22:27,690
He wants your permission to pull back
and regroup outside of town.

1319
02:22:30,536 --> 02:22:35,291
No,damn it. We came here

1320
02:22:35,507 --> 02:22:37,795
We're gonna take it and hold it.

1321
02:22:38,777 --> 02:22:41,234
Follow the lieutenant,gentlemen.

1322
02:22:52,291 --> 02:22:54,555
-Sir.
-Thank you.

1323
02:22:55,894 --> 02:22:59,751
British and Canadians advancing
steadily from Sword,Gold,and Juno.

1324
02:23:03,135 --> 02:23:05,000
Anything from Omaha?

1325
02:23:05,304 --> 02:23:09,434
Nothing since the first message:
heavy fighting,heavy casualties.

1326
02:23:09,675 --> 02:23:11,768
Sir.

1327
02:23:14,313 --> 02:23:15,439
Omaha?

1328
02:23:17,316 --> 02:23:18,340
No.

1329
02:23:21,954 --> 02:23:25,776
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't
brought his heavy armor into play.

1330
02:23:26,658 --> 02:23:29,252
All the panzer divisions
except the 21 st...

1331
02:23:29,528 --> 02:23:32,053
...seem to be sitting it out
in the rear.

1332
02:23:32,664 --> 02:23:33,688
Sir.

1333
02:23:36,902 --> 02:23:40,565
"French commandos driving inland
from Sword...

1334
02:23:40,839 --> 02:23:43,171
...have reached the outskirts
of Ouistreham."

1335
02:23:43,842 --> 02:23:45,366
Ouistreham.

1336
02:26:36,148 --> 02:26:37,843
Fall back!

1337
02:26:40,619 --> 02:26:42,246
Take cover!

1338
02:26:58,036 --> 02:27:02,063
Tank support!
We must have tank support!

1339
02:27:03,341 --> 02:27:09,200
Hello,Bastille. Hello,Batille.
This is Windsor. Come on,Bastille!

1340
02:27:27,232 --> 02:27:28,563
Fire!

1341
02:27:36,108 --> 02:27:38,531
Attention!

1342
02:27:38,877 --> 02:27:40,367
Fire!

1343
02:27:44,082 --> 02:27:48,371
Hello,Bastille. Hello,Batille.
This is Windsor. Come on,Bastille!

1344
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:50,315
I can't get them!

1345
02:27:50,655 --> 02:27:52,782
Keep trying! We must have support!

1346
02:27:53,425 --> 02:27:57,782
Hold your positions.
I'm going for a tank!

1347
02:27:59,097 --> 02:28:01,554
Give us as much cover as you can!

1348
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:24,411
The bridge,right!

1349
02:28:49,648 --> 02:28:51,013
Fire!

1350
02:28:56,154 --> 02:28:57,416
Try for the cannon!

1351
02:29:03,028 --> 02:29:05,519
Get the wounded out of here!

1352
02:29:33,525 --> 02:29:34,549
Go back!

1353
02:29:35,393 --> 02:29:36,758
Get out of here!

1354
02:29:38,563 --> 02:29:40,519
No! Go back!

1355
02:29:55,814 --> 02:29:57,975
You can't stay here!

1356
02:29:58,216 --> 02:30:00,980
I am Mother Superior of the convent.

1357
02:30:01,219 --> 02:30:03,676
The Sisters are qualified nurses.

1358
02:30:03,922 --> 02:30:09,121
But madame-- I mean,Mother,
we're in the middle of a battle!

1359
02:30:10,328 --> 02:30:14,094
Excuse me.
Take care of the wounded.

1360
02:30:49,634 --> 02:30:50,658
It's a tank!

1361
02:30:53,405 --> 02:30:54,838
It's Kieffer!

1362
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:07,243
In the other direction!

1363
02:31:18,129 --> 02:31:21,519
Clear away the debris! Hurry!

1364
02:31:58,536 --> 02:32:00,925
But where is the Luftwaffe?!

1365
02:32:01,172 --> 02:32:04,300
-I'm trying.
-Yeah,yeah,you're trying.

1366
02:32:12,417 --> 02:32:17,116
The British troops have a beachhead
here. They are moving inland.

1367
02:32:17,355 --> 02:32:23,214
and have cut the highway.

1368
02:32:23,428 --> 02:32:26,556
We control this center section.

1369
02:32:27,098 --> 02:32:32,422
The Americans have landed but
their attack has bogged down.

1370
02:32:33,104 --> 02:32:35,959
Rommel is right.

1371
02:32:36,241 --> 02:32:39,699
If we can hold them on the beaches...

1372
02:32:39,944 --> 02:32:41,935
...the invasion will collapse.

1373
02:33:17,048 --> 02:33:18,640
Medic!

1374
02:33:18,917 --> 02:33:19,941
That thing still work?

1375
02:33:20,151 --> 02:33:22,312
Yes,sir,now and then.

1376
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:25,045
-Anything from the other beaches?
-Not directly.

1377
02:33:25,423 --> 02:33:28,950
A while ago the sergeant picked up
some flashes from the destroyers.

1378
02:33:29,694 --> 02:33:33,892
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach
and moving inland.

1379
02:33:34,132 --> 02:33:35,497
Inland?

1380
02:33:37,936 --> 02:33:41,030
-What about the 1 st Division?
-They're hung up,sir.

1381
02:33:41,272 --> 02:33:42,705
Like we are.

1382
02:33:47,145 --> 02:33:48,510
Move out.

1383
02:33:57,956 --> 02:34:00,413
Medic!

1384
02:34:07,799 --> 02:34:10,165
-What do you think?
-Think?

1385
02:34:11,069 --> 02:34:14,368
We must have close to 1000
casualties up to now.

1386
02:34:14,572 --> 02:34:17,234
Do you want me to have the ships
start picking us up?

1387
02:34:18,042 --> 02:34:20,670
-You think it's that bad?
-I don't see what else to do.

1388
02:34:20,979 --> 02:34:22,708
We can't get up this hill.

1389
02:34:22,981 --> 02:34:25,905
If we don't get off this beach,
we won't have any division left.

1390
02:34:26,084 --> 02:34:27,847
What?

1391
02:34:28,019 --> 02:34:29,816
These are our men,Tom.

1392
02:34:30,021 --> 02:34:34,082
You think we brought them in so some
die and ask the rest to turn tail?

1393
02:34:34,325 --> 02:34:37,089
Hell,no.
We're gonna get up that hill.

1394
02:34:37,328 --> 02:34:39,888
Find me somebody to speak
for the Rangers.

1395
02:34:40,098 --> 02:34:42,862
Back down the beach
on the right there's a gully.

1396
02:34:43,201 --> 02:34:48,127
With a heavily defended roadblock
and machine gun nests on both sides.

1397
02:34:48,373 --> 02:34:51,467
-If we can blow our way through--
-We've hit it three times.

1398
02:34:51,709 --> 02:34:54,132
-We didn't get close.
-Three times isn't enough.

1399
02:34:54,512 --> 02:34:57,538
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?

1400
02:34:57,715 --> 02:34:58,943
They're all around you!

1401
02:34:59,150 --> 02:35:01,482
I mean engineers
with equipment still working.

1402
02:35:03,288 --> 02:35:05,119
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?

1403
02:35:05,356 --> 02:35:06,584
No,damn it!

1404
02:35:06,791 --> 02:35:10,921
We need bangalore torpedoes,
bazookas,mortars,wire cutters...

1405
02:35:11,095 --> 02:35:13,791
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word,will you?

1406
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:16,999
Okay,Norm.

1407
02:35:33,618 --> 02:35:36,007
Now listen to me,all of you.

1408
02:35:36,754 --> 02:35:39,018
You guys got to snap out of it.

1409
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:42,145
We're getting off of here,
and we're going inland.

1410
02:35:42,427 --> 02:35:45,385
What about weapons,general?
My men lost everything.

1411
02:35:45,597 --> 02:35:47,986
They gotta have something
to fight with.

1412
02:35:48,199 --> 02:35:50,030
Strip the dead and the wounded.

1413
02:35:50,268 --> 02:35:52,259
Pick up anything that'll shoot.

1414
02:35:52,570 --> 02:35:55,164
I don't have to tell you the score,
you all know it.

1415
02:35:55,406 --> 02:35:58,330
Only two kinds of people
are gonna stay on this beach:

1416
02:35:58,576 --> 02:36:02,501
Those that are already dead and those
that will die. Get off your butts!

1417
02:36:02,714 --> 02:36:05,444
You guys are the fighting 29th!

1418
02:36:22,967 --> 02:36:24,696
I've looked at the naval reports.

1419
02:36:24,936 --> 02:36:26,028
Yes?

1420
02:36:26,871 --> 02:36:31,001
According to reports from the offshore
destroyers,Omaha is a shambles.

1421
02:36:31,476 --> 02:36:34,206
There's no evidence--
To quote the report exactly:

1422
02:36:34,445 --> 02:36:38,734
"There is no evidence of any movement
that can be observed off the beach."

1423
02:36:40,785 --> 02:36:42,514
I'd better have a look through these.

1424
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:47,580
How is Ike taking it?

1425
02:36:47,792 --> 02:36:51,558
Like everybody else,sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.

1426
02:36:53,965 --> 02:36:57,696
No,no! We must regroup
according to Plan Six!

1427
02:37:01,973 --> 02:37:05,864
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?

1428
02:37:06,077 --> 02:37:09,569
I said we must regroup
according to Plan Six.

1429
02:37:10,581 --> 02:37:12,412
Nonsense!

1430
02:37:12,617 --> 02:37:15,916
If the panzers arrive,we still
have time to use them.

1431
02:37:19,557 --> 02:37:21,684
We'll drive to the coast!

1432
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:23,982
Shall we remove the files?

1433
02:37:24,395 --> 02:37:28,991
I don't care! I want to get to the
front at once,to Normandy!

1434
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:30,189
Yes,general.

1435
02:37:57,729 --> 02:38:00,027
-Where is everybody?
-What?

1436
02:38:02,433 --> 02:38:04,628
I said,where is everybody?

1437
02:38:07,105 --> 02:38:09,061
I can't hear you.

1438
02:38:10,308 --> 02:38:12,173
It's them bells.

1439
02:38:12,410 --> 02:38:15,265
I've had them in my ears
for 10 hours.

1440
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:18,472
Ding-dong,ding-dong.

1441
02:38:20,284 --> 02:38:22,445
Hey,sergeant,where's Major Lance?

1442
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:25,111
We moved the CP to that
building. The major's there.

1443
02:38:25,323 --> 02:38:27,188
Get him,the colonel's here.

1444
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:29,852
What?

1445
02:38:31,863 --> 02:38:33,854
Hold it!

1446
02:38:43,775 --> 02:38:45,970
Colonel,am I glad to see you!

1447
02:38:47,111 --> 02:38:50,205
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.

1448
02:38:50,448 --> 02:38:52,837
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!

1449
02:38:53,084 --> 02:38:54,847
But we've been under fire,sir.

1450
02:38:55,086 --> 02:38:57,077
I know you have,but I don't care!

1451
02:38:57,288 --> 02:38:59,483
Get them down! Down!

1452
02:38:59,857 --> 02:39:03,816
-I don't want those boys left there.
-Take a detail and cut them down.

1453
02:39:04,028 --> 02:39:05,893
-At once!
-Yes,sir.

1454
02:39:10,134 --> 02:39:14,798
Has there been a linkup between our
forces and the troops from the sea?

1455
02:39:15,006 --> 02:39:19,238
I don't know,major. I don't even
know if the landings took place.

1456
02:39:19,477 --> 02:39:24,232
But I am sure we're gonna hold
this town until the linkup does come.

1457
02:39:24,482 --> 02:39:29,010
Whenever that is,today,tomorrow,
till hell freezes over.

1458
02:39:30,621 --> 02:39:32,509
For their sake,
if for no other reason.

1459
02:39:32,824 --> 02:39:35,213
Show me the enemy positions.

1460
02:39:35,426 --> 02:39:38,315
Well,sir,the Germans' strong point
is right there.

1461
02:39:38,529 --> 02:39:41,362
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.

1462
02:39:41,566 --> 02:39:45,662
They've got heavy guns and machine
gun positions at the top of that road.

1463
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:48,134
How many men have you got?

1464
02:39:48,339 --> 02:39:49,397
Not enough.

1465
02:39:49,674 --> 02:39:53,531
Lieutenant Wilson will take A Company
and reinforce Major Lance.

1466
02:39:54,212 --> 02:39:58,945
The rest of the command will follow us
straight up that road.

1467
02:40:00,218 --> 02:40:01,276
Good luck,major.

1468
02:40:01,519 --> 02:40:04,079
All right,A Company,fall out.

1469
02:40:04,355 --> 02:40:06,380
-Private.
-Yes,sir.

1470
02:40:06,557 --> 02:40:07,751
It's a hell of a war.

1471
02:40:07,959 --> 02:40:10,519
It's a privilege to serve
with you,colonel.

1472
02:40:10,728 --> 02:40:14,755
Well,God willing,we'll do
what we came here to do.

1473
02:40:14,966 --> 02:40:16,854
Ready,sir.

1474
02:40:17,168 --> 02:40:18,863
Move out!

1475
02:40:29,113 --> 02:40:32,674
The old man sure has changed
since yesterday.

1476
02:40:38,556 --> 02:40:41,753
Or maybe it's just
that we've changed...

1477
02:40:41,926 --> 02:40:43,553
...since yesterday.

1478
02:40:51,369 --> 02:40:53,929
Lovat and his commandos
have reached the bridge.

1479
02:40:55,072 --> 02:40:56,505
Bob,did you hear?

1480
02:40:57,208 --> 02:40:58,766
Yes,I heard.

1481
02:41:00,144 --> 02:41:04,706
"Sainte-M¨¨re-Eglise captured
by units of the 82nd Airborne."

1482
02:41:06,517 --> 02:41:09,350
" 101 Airborne driving on Utah."

1483
02:41:09,587 --> 02:41:12,283
That's good. Good.

1484
02:41:12,723 --> 02:41:17,615
Yes,but if we can't get off Omaha
it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.

1485
02:41:17,895 --> 02:41:21,285
We'll have two cut-off beachheads,
one in British zone and one at Utah.

1486
02:41:21,499 --> 02:41:22,523
Yes...

1487
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:25,027
...and the Germans in between.

1488
02:41:40,518 --> 02:41:42,349
You guys engineers?

1489
02:41:43,788 --> 02:41:45,517
Yes,sir,299th.

1490
02:41:45,756 --> 02:41:48,645
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?

1491
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:51,751
I guess I am,sir.
None of our officers made it in.

1492
02:41:51,963 --> 02:41:53,988
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?

1493
02:41:54,198 --> 02:41:56,189
Yes,sir,we'll make them work!

1494
02:41:57,568 --> 02:42:00,264
-What's your name,sergeant?
-It's Fuller,sir,John H.

1495
02:42:00,571 --> 02:42:04,063
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on,
whether you like it or not.

1496
02:42:06,644 --> 02:42:10,171
You send some men down to the foot
of that gully with those torpedoes.

1497
02:42:10,448 --> 02:42:14,179
-You and the rest of the men follow me.
-Yes,sir!

1498
02:42:14,452 --> 02:42:17,979
All right,men!
Let's move that equipment down here.

1499
02:42:24,462 --> 02:42:27,795
-I got a rifle,sir.
-Well,good for you,son!

1500
02:42:28,466 --> 02:42:29,922
The Rangers are ready,general.

1501
02:42:30,101 --> 02:42:32,490
Okay,major,move them out.

1502
02:42:32,703 --> 02:42:35,433
Captain,move them up.

1503
02:42:35,673 --> 02:42:37,868
Move them up!

1504
02:42:40,077 --> 02:42:41,942
-Well,Tom?
-We're ready.

1505
02:42:42,179 --> 02:42:43,806
As ready as we'll ever be.

1506
02:42:44,015 --> 02:42:46,848
It'll work. It's got to work.

1507
02:42:48,619 --> 02:42:53,010
We're getting murdered here! We might
as well move inland and get murdered!

1508
02:42:57,028 --> 02:42:58,586
-You ready?
-Yes,sir.

1509
02:42:58,829 --> 02:43:01,457
You're gonna blow
that roadblock for me.

1510
02:43:01,699 --> 02:43:04,224
When I give the word
everything pops at once. Okay?

1511
02:43:04,502 --> 02:43:06,834
Yes,sir.

1512
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:36,591
First,we gotta blow a hole
through that wire with bangalores.

1513
02:43:36,867 --> 02:43:40,928
If that works,we'll pack
everything we've got into that wall.

1514
02:43:42,039 --> 02:43:43,495
All right,let's go!

1515
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:47,782
All right,let's go! Go! Go!

1516
02:47:47,117 --> 02:47:50,712
We must leave. The main highway
is under aerial attack.

1517
02:47:50,955 --> 02:47:52,616
You don't say!

1518
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:31,610
Don't worry,Yank.

1519
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:37,818
He's dead.

1520
02:49:59,349 --> 02:50:03,240
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.

1521
02:50:11,128 --> 02:50:12,561
You hurt bad?

1522
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:18,488
Shot down during the night.

1523
02:50:22,473 --> 02:50:26,637
He was gonna make sure of me,
but I got him...

1524
02:50:27,111 --> 02:50:28,544
...with this.

1525
02:50:39,156 --> 02:50:43,081
You ever killed a man?
I mean,face to face?

1526
02:50:44,928 --> 02:50:46,987
No.

1527
02:50:47,164 --> 02:50:50,827
Neither had I,face to face.

1528
02:50:54,371 --> 02:50:56,862
I've been sitting here looking at him.

1529
02:50:58,442 --> 02:51:01,172
Have you noticed anything peculiar
about him?

1530
02:51:11,155 --> 02:51:13,111
No.

1531
02:51:13,891 --> 02:51:15,620
He's got his boots...

1532
02:51:15,959 --> 02:51:18,120
...on the wrong feet.

1533
02:51:25,702 --> 02:51:27,624
He must have been
in a big hurry,huh?

1534
02:51:30,173 --> 02:51:31,401
Is it bad?

1535
02:51:34,277 --> 02:51:36,165
Split wide open...

1536
02:51:37,481 --> 02:51:39,574
...from the crotch to the knee.

1537
02:51:40,283 --> 02:51:44,276
A medic came along and gave me
a shot of morphine.

1538
02:51:47,023 --> 02:51:49,583
I hope he'll be back
before it wears off.

1539
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,159
He said he would.

1540
02:51:55,098 --> 02:51:56,793
Did he sew you up?

1541
02:52:00,670 --> 02:52:05,698
Well,when he came ashore
he lost most of his equipment.

1542
02:52:07,377 --> 02:52:09,208
So he pinned it together...

1543
02:52:10,247 --> 02:52:12,306
...with safety pins.

1544
02:52:24,027 --> 02:52:25,483
Getting on toward night.

1545
02:52:33,703 --> 02:52:34,965
You know something?

1546
02:52:36,540 --> 02:52:38,496
I haven't fired my gun all day.

1547
02:52:39,042 --> 02:52:42,808
I keep hearing shooting,but every
time I get there,everybody's gone.

1548
02:52:46,716 --> 02:52:48,149
Funny,isn't it?

1549
02:52:49,553 --> 02:52:50,781
He's dead.

1550
02:52:52,055 --> 02:52:53,647
I'm crippled.

1551
02:52:54,824 --> 02:52:56,485
You're lost.

1552
02:52:59,062 --> 02:53:00,927
I suppose it's always like that.

1553
02:53:02,866 --> 02:53:04,424
I mean war.

1554
02:53:11,942 --> 02:53:13,773
I wonder who won.

1555
02:53:56,653 --> 02:53:59,315
Okay,run me up the hill,son.

1556
02:58:18,333 --> 02:58:20,333
