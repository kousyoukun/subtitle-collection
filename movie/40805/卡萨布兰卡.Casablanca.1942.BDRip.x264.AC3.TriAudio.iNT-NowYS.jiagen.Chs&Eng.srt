2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,290
片名  北非谍影

3
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,110
二次大战迫近
With the coming of the Second World War...

4
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,690
很多被困在欧洲的人们 怀着希望甚至急切地
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately...

5
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,610
想要来到自由的美洲
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

6
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,320
里斯本成为热络的航运地点
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.

7
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,690
不过并非每个人均能直接 到达里斯本
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.

8
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,790
因此一条艰苦迂回的 逃难路线出现
And so a torturous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.

9
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,460
从巴黎到马赛
Paris to Marseilles...

10
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,140
越过地中海到奥朗
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

11
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,950
然后搭火车、汽车或走路 沿着非洲的海岸线
Then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of Africa...

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,630
来到法属摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

13
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,860
在这里幸运的人 藉着钱、影响力、或运气
Here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck...

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,460
可能拿到出境许可证 然后赶往里斯本
...might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.

15
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,700
再从里斯本到新世界
And from Lisbon to the New World.

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,100
不过其余的人则在卡萨布兰卡
But the others wait in Casablanca.

17
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,230
等待、等待、再等待
And wait and wait

18
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,480
所有军官注意
To all officers:

19
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,630
两位身怀重要官方文件的德国快递员
Two German couriers carrying official documents...

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,630
在从奥朗开出的火车上被杀
...murdered on train from Oran.

21
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,720
凶手和可能的共犯 正前往卡萨布兰卡
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca.

22
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,070
拘留所有嫌疑人物 并搜查被偷走的文件
Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document.

23
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,500
这个任务相当重要
Important.

24
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,210
(法语)

25
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,670
可否看一下你的证件?
May we see your papers?

26
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,670
我没有带在身上
I don't think I have them on me.

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,240
既然如此 我们必须请你跟我们走 等一下 可能是...
- In that case, you'll have to come along. - Wait. It 's possible that I...

28
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,440
在这里
Yes. Here they are.

29
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,450
这些证件三个星期前已过期了  你必须跟我们走
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.

30
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,350
站住!
Halt!

31
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,610
站住!
Halt!

32
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,740
“自由，平等，同胞爱”

33
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,250
那边发生什么事?  我不知道  亲爱的
- What on earth is going on there? - I don't know, my dear.

34
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,920
对不起  先生  你没听说吗?
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame. Have you not heard?

35
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,880
我们听到的不多 我们听得明白的更少
We hear very little, and we understand even less.

36
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,720
两位德国快递员在沙漠被发现遭谋杀  那无人的沙漠
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

37
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,400
这是惯例的搜捕自由主义者
This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals...

38
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,230
难民和给警察首长的漂亮女孩
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl for Renault, the prefect of police.

39
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,980
不幸的是伴随着这些不快乐的难民
Along with these unappy refugees,

40
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,980
是欧洲的坏蛋们 都集中到卡萨布兰卡
the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,440
有些为了出境证等了好几年
Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,910
我请求你  先生  自己要当心 谨慎提防
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself. Be on guard.

43
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,110
这地方布满贪婪的人
This place is full of vultures.

44
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,010
到处都是贪婪的人  到处都是
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

45
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,350
谢谢  非常感谢 不谢 再见
- Thank you. Thank you very much. - Not at all.

46
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,690
很有趣的小家伙
What an amusing little fellow.

47
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,190
服务生
Waiter.

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,730
我真笨 什么?  亲爱的
- Oh, how silly of me. - What, dear?

49
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,130
我把皮夹子留在饭店
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

50
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,950
或许明天我们会在飞机上
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.

51
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,850
“瑞克美式咖啡馆”

52
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,250
希特勒万岁!

53
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,370
再见到你真好  史查沙少校
It is good to see you again, Major Strasser.

55
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,070
让我来介绍雷诺队长 卡萨布兰卡的警察首长
May I present Captain Renault, police prefect of Casablanca.

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,290
史查沙少校
Major Strasser.

57
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,410
未被占据的法国属地 欢迎你来到卡萨布兰卡
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.

58
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,590
谢谢  队长  来到这里真好
Thank you, captain. It's good to be here.

59
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,420
史查沙少校  这位是我的副官 卡箫副队长
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.

60
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,060
唐里尼队长 意大利军听候指示
Captain Tonnelli. The Italian service at your command.

61
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,860
下次吧  谢谢
That is kind of you.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,090
(意大利文)

63
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,800
他听不明白你说什么 (法语)

64
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,740
你可能觉得 卡萨布兰卡的天气有一点暖
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm.

65
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,570
全德国人必须适应各种天气 从俄国到撒哈拉
We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

66
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,910
或许你所指的不是天气 不然会是什么?  亲爱的少校
- Perhaps you werert referring to weather. - What else?

67
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,280
关于被谋杀的快递员 你们做了些什么?
The murder of the couriers. What has been done?

68
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,250
我的手下逮捕的疑犯人数是平常的两倍
My men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,450
我们已知道凶手是谁 很好  我已在警方监管中吗?
- But we know already who the murderer is. - Good. Is he in custody?

70
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,160
不必急 今晚他会去瑞克咖啡馆
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.

71
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,660
每个人都会去瑞克咖啡馆
Everybody comes to Rick's.

72
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,220
我已听说过这家咖啡馆 并且听说过瑞克他本人
I've already heard about this cafe. And also about Mr. Rick himself.

73
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,010
等待、等待、等待
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

74
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,190
我永远离不开这里了
I'll never get out of here.

75
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,460
我会死在卡萨布兰卡
I'll die in Casablanca.

76
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,890
可是你不能再加一点吗?
But can't you make it just a little more?

77
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,030
求求你
Please?

78
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,400
对不起  女士 可是钻石在市场上不易脱手
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

79
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,200
所有的人都在卖钻石 到处都是钻石  两千四百元
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

80
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,430
好吧
All right.

81
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,310
卡车准备好了  人手在等着 一切都...
The trucks are waiting. The men are waiting. Everything...

82
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,370
(德语)

83
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,500
是"圣地牙哥号" 渔船
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

84
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,080
明天晚上一点离开 这里  从麦地那号后第三艘船
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

85
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,590
谢谢  谢谢 并带一万五千元法O现金
- Thank you. Thank you. - And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

86
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,020
记住  一定要现金
Remember, in cash.

87
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,530
不必愁，我们全都预备好了

88
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,660
(俄语)

89
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,600
开门  阿都 是的  教授先生
- Open up, Abdul. - Yes, professor.

90
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,040
先生 女士红色

91
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,500
先生黑色

92
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,340
服务生 是的  女士
- Waiter? - Yes, madame?

93
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,210
可否问瑞克要不要跟我们喝酒
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?

94
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,110
女士  他从不跟顾客喝酒的 从来不  我从没见过
Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen it.

95
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,050
是什么原因?  使酒廊老板如此势利
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

96
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,090
或许如果你告诉他 我在阿姆斯特丹 经营第二大银行
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

97
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,790
第二大?  那不会叫瑞克刮目相看
Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,520
阿姆斯特丹的头号银行家 现在是我们厨房的糕饼师傅
The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

99
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,200
我们有值得盼望的事情了
We have something to look forward to.

100
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,730
而他爸爸是侍者
And his father is the bellboy.

101
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,470
给女士的 先生

102
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,700
“一千法O”

103
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,180
“好的，瑞克”

104
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,940
对不起
Excuse me.

105
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,870
对不起  先生 这是私人的房间
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private room.

106
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,880
好大胆  我知道里面在赌博  又不是秘密
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...? I know there is gambling in there.

107
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,380
你岂敢不让我进去  有什么麻烦?  这位先生
- You dare not keep me out. - Yes? What's the trouble?

108
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,870
从夏威夷到柏林每个赌场 我都去过
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin.

109
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,650
如果你认为 不该让我进这种赌场
And if you think I'm going to be kept out of a saloon like this,

110
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,250
你可是大错特错
you're much mistaken.

111
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,260
对不起 哈罗  瑞克
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

112
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,720
你的现金在酒吧可以用
Your cash is good at the bar.

113
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,890
什么?  你知道我是谁吗?
What? Do you know who I am?

114
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,070
我知道 酒吧让你光顾算你走运
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

115
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,240
可恶极了 我会向有关当局报告
This is outrageous! I shall report it to The Angriff.

116
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,070
看你刚才那样对待德国银行家
You know, watching you just now,

117
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,700
会以为你整辈子都在做这种事
one would think you've been doing this all your life.

118
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,580
是什么使你认为我没有?  没什么
- What makes you think I haven't? - Nothing.

119
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,720
不过你刚来卡萨布兰卡时我想 你想什么?
- But when you first came, I thought... - You thought what?

120
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,420
我有什么权利去想?
What right do I have to think?

121
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,720
我可以吗?
May I

122
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,420
那两名德国快递员真不幸 对不对
Too bad about those two German couriers, wasrt it?

123
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,260
他们走运了 昨天他们还是两名德国办事员
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just clerks...

124
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,700
而今天他们成了光荣的死者
...today they are the honored dead.

125
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,110
你是个很愤世嫉俗的人  瑞克  请原谅我这样说
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.

126
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,070
我原谅你
I forgive you.

127
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,940
谢谢  你可否跟我喝一杯 不
- Will you have a drink with me? - No.

128
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,950
我忘了  你从不跟任何人喝酒 请再给我一杯
I forgot, you never drink with... I'll have another, please.

129
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,780
你轻视我  对不对?
You despise me, don't you?

130
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,140
如果是我让你这样想 我大概是吧
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

131
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,650
可是为什么?
But why?

132
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,750
你反对我所做的那种生意?
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

133
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,030
可是为那些可怜的难民想一想
But think of all those poor refugees...

134
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,030
如果我不帮他们必然困死这里
...who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

135
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,800
那不算太坏  透过我的方法 我提供他们出境许可证
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own, I provide them with exit visas.

136
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,130
有代价的  尤佳迪  有代价的
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

137
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,700
为那些付不起 雷诺开的价钱的可怜虫想想
But think of all the poor devils who can't meet Renault 's price.

138
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,400
我以半价替他们弄到手 这算寄生虫吗?
I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

139
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,070
我不反对寄生虫 我反对折价的寄生虫
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

140
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,650
在今晚之后 所有的事情将成过去
Well, after tonight I will be through with the whole business.

141
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,510
我要离开卡萨布兰卡
And I' m leaving, finally, this Casablanca.

142
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,850
你的出境许可是向谁买的?  雷诺还是你自己?
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?

143
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,420
我自己觉得自己的价钱较合理
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

144
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,950
你看
Look, Rick.

145
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,300
知道这是什么吗?
Know what this is?

146
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,600
即使是你也从来没看过的东西
Something that even you have never seen.

147
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,930
过境信函 由戴高乐将军签名的
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle.

148
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,440
不能废止  甚至不能盘问
Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.

149
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,570
等一下
One moment.

150
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,070
今晚我会 以作梦也想不到的价钱卖出去
Tonight I' II be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of.

151
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,080
然后  再见  卡萨布兰卡
And then, addio, Casablanca.

152
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,090
我在卡萨布兰卡有很多朋友 可是不晓得为什么
I have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me...

153
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,520
因为你轻视我 你是我唯一信任的人
...you are the only one I trust.

154
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,280
请你替我保管好吗?  多久?
Will you keep these for me, please?

155
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,330
或许一小时  或许久一点点
- For how long? - Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

156
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,860
我不要放过夜
- I don't want them here overnight. - Don't be afraid of that.

157
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,950
别担心  请替我保管
Please keep them for me.

158
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,330
谢谢  我知道我可以信任你
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

159
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,840
侍者  我正在等一些人
Waiter. I' II be expecting some people.

160
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,670
如果有谁找我  我会在这里
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.

161
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,110
瑞克
Rick...

162
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,430
我想你现在对我比较刮目相看
...I hope you're more impressed with me now.

163
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,040
请恕我失陪  我要跟你的轮盘 分享我的好运气
If you'll forgive me, I' II share my good luck with your roulette wheel.

164
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,310
等一下
Just a moment.

165
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,180
我听谣言说那两名德国快递员 身上带着过境信函
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit.

166
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,890
我也听过那谣言  可怜虫
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

167
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,090
你说对了  尤佳迪 我是对你比较刮目相看了
You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you.

168
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,350
哈罗  瑞克
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Ferrari.

169
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,610
法拉利 "蓝鹦鹉" 的生意如何
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

170
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,350
很好  不过我想买你的咖啡馆
- Fine, but I' d like to buy your cafe. - It 's not for sale.

171
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,820
那是不卖的 你还没听我出价呢!  多少钱也不卖
- You haven't heard my offer. - It 's not for sale at any price.

172
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,520
你要多少才肯卖山姆 我不买卖人口
- What do you want for Sam? - I don't buy or sell human beings.

173
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,790
可惜 人是卡萨布兰卡主要商品
Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,130
光只是难民 我们就能大赚一笔
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,

175
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,130
如果你跟我一起做黑市生意
if you'd work with me in the black market.

176
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,630
不妨你做你的  我做我的
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.

177
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,910
我们不妨去问山姆 他喜欢改变一下
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.

178
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,170
我们不妨去问
Suppose we do.

179
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,480
我亲爱的瑞克 什么时候才明白
When will you realize...

180
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
在今天这个世界  孤立不再是项实际的政策
...that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

181
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,240
法拉利想要你到蓝鹦鹉工作
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

182
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,510
我喜欢这里
Oh, I like it fine here.

183
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,150
他出双倍我给你的薪水
- He'll double what I pay you.

184
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,150
可是我在这里赚的钱已没时间花
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

185
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,050
对不起
Sorry.

186
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,220
老板的私人存货
The boss's private stock...

187
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,830
因为  伊娃  我爱你 闭嘴
...because, Yvonne, I love you. - Oh, shut up.

188
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,160
好吧  为了你  我会闭嘴 因为  伊娃  我爱你
All right, all right. For you, I shut up, because, Yvonne, I love you.

189
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,370
一些德国人付了这张支票 可不可以?
Some Germans gave this check. Is it all right?

190
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,880
你昨晚到那里了?
Where were you last night?

191
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,310
那么久以前的事 我记不起来了
That's so long ago, I don't remember.

192
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,980
我今晚可以见到你吗?  我从不计划那么遥远的事
- Will I see you tonight? - I never make plans that far ahead.

193
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,520
再给我一杯
Give me another.

194
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,460
沙克  她已喝够了 别听他的  帮我倒满
- Sascha, she's had enough. - Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

195
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,820
伊娃我爱你  可是他付我薪水
Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.

196
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,600
瑞克  我已厌倦你了 沙克  叫部计程车 是的
- Rick, I' m tired of having you... - Sascha, call a cab.

197
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,000
来吧  我们去拿你的外衣
- We're gonna get your coat. - Take your hands off me.

198
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,830
别碰我 你该回家  你喝的已够多了
You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.

199
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,270
嘿  计程车
Hey, taxi.

200
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,140
你以为你是谁?  把我推来推去
Who do you think you are, pushing me around?

201
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,070
我真是傻瓜爱上你这种男人
I was a fool to fall for a man like you.

202
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,850
你送她沙克  要肯定她回到家
Go with her, Sascha. Be sure she gets home.

203
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,640
是的  老板 然后马上回来
And come right back.

204
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,120
是  老板
Yes, boss.

205
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,560
哈罗  瑞克 路易
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Louis.

206
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,030
你真奢侈  这样把女人抛开
How extravagant you are, throwing away women.

207
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,930
有一天她们可能会渐渐消失
Someday they may be scarce.

208
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,370
我想现在我该去拜访伊娃
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

209
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,160
或许可藉反作用占到便宜
Maybe get her on the rebound.

210
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,470
一讲到女人 你就是不折不扣的民主党
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

211
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,780
(法语)

212
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,720
如果他听得明白一个字 意大利将大获全胜
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.

213
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,750
往里斯本的飞机
The plane to Lisbon.

214
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,230
你会想坐在里面
You would like to be on it?

215
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,100
为什么?  里斯本有什么好?
Why? What's in Lisbon?

216
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,340
到美国的快航
The clipper to America.

217
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,240
我常思索为什么你不返回美国
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.

218
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,700
你卷走教堂的基金逃吗?  你跟参议员的太太私奔?
Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife?

219
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,440
我喜欢想像你杀了人 这满足我浪漫的遐想
Llike to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.

220
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,310
是三者的综合
It's a combination of all three.

221
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,950
到底是什么带你到卡萨布兰卡
And what in heavers name brought you to Casablanca?

222
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,880
我的健康  我来卡萨布兰卡 是为了这地方的水
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

223
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,050
水?  什么水?  我们在沙漠里
The waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

224
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,460
我的消息错误
I was misinformed.

225
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,400
对不起!  瑞克先生
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

226
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,400
里面一位先生赢了两万块法O
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs...

227
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,960
出纳需要一些钱
...and the cashier would like some money.

228
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,570
我从保险柜拿
I'll get it from the safe.

229
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,300
我好难过  瑞克先生
I'm so upset, Rick. You know l- -

230
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,100
别提了  艾米 这种事常常发生
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.

231
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,080
我非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry.

232
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,320
瑞克 今晚这里会有点刺激的事
Rick, there will be some excitement here tonight.

233
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
我们将在你的咖啡馆逮捕人
An arrest in your cafe.

234
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,220
什么?  又一次?  这不是普通的逮捕
- Again? - This is no ordinary arrest.

235
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,790
是谋杀犯
A murderer, no less.

236
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,130
如果你想要警告他 别让自己不方便 你逃不过监视的
If you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

237
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,500
我不为任何人冒险的 明智的外交政策
- I stick my neck out for nobody. - A wise foreign policy.

238
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,630
(法语)

239
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,300
我们本可以在今晚较早时 在蓝鹦鹉进行逮捕
Could have made the arrest earlier, at the Blue Parrot.

240
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,600
为了表示我对你的敬意 我们在这里进行
Out of my regard for you, we're staging it here.

241
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,240
可以带给你的顾客一点娱乐
It will amuse your customers.

242
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,940
我们的娱乐节目已经够多了
Our entertainment's enough.

243
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,580
瑞克  今晚我们这里有名贵客
We're to have an important guest here tonight.

244
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,250
第三帝国的史查沙少校
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

245
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,610
我们进行逮捕时希望他在场
We want him to be here when we make the arrest.

246
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,350
以示范一下我办事的效率
A demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.

247
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,460
我明白 史查沙来这里干什么?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here?

248
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,560
他不可能老远来到卡萨布兰卡
He certainly didn't come here...

249
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,560
为了目击你的办事效率吧?
...to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.

250
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,860
或许不是 拿去吧
- Perhaps not. - Here.

251
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,160
不会再发生了 没关系
- It shall not happen again. - That's all right.

252
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,200
我知道你心里有事情 何不直接说出来?
Louis, you got something on your mind. Why don't you spill it.

253
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,870
你观察力真好
How observant you are.

254
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,940
事实上我想劝告你一声
As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

255
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,080
是吗?
Yeah?

256
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,680
要喝白兰地吗?  谢谢
- Have a brandy? - Thank you.

257
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,280
瑞克  在这咖啡馆里 有很多出境证卖出去
There are many exit visas sold in this cafe,

258
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
不过我们知道你一张也没卖过
but we know that you've never sold one.

259
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,480
所以我们才准许你营业
That is the reason we permit you to remain open.

260
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,950
我还以为是我让你在轮盘赢钱
I thought it was because llet you win at roulette.

261
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,350
那是另一个原因
That is another reason.

262
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,320
有一个要前往美国的人 已抵达卡萨布兰卡
There is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America.

263
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,400
他会给任何提供他出境证的人 一大笔钱
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa.

264
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,330
他叫什么名字?  维多拉斯路
- What's his name? - Victor Laszlo.

265
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,870
维多拉斯路?
Victor Laszlo?

266
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,630
瑞克  这是我第一次看到 有人如此令你着迷
Rick, that is the first time I've seen you so impressed.

267
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,770
半个地球的人都为他着迷
He's succeeded in impressing half the world.

268
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,710
我的责任就是阻止 另一半的地球人不再为他着迷
It's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half.

269
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,780
瑞克  拉斯路绝不能踏足美国 他要留在卡萨布兰卡
Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.

270
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,850
看他如何达成将很有趣
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.

271
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,180
达成什么?  他的逃亡
- Manages what? - His escape.

272
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,420
我刚才告诉你...
- But I just told you... - Stop it.

273
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,150
够了  他从集中营逃出来 纳粹党在欧洲到处追捕他
He escaped from a concentration camp. The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

274
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,590
这是追捕的最终站
This is the end of the chase.

275
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,390
赌两万法O  不是
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

276
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,930
这是认真的吗?
Is that a serious offer?

277
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,460
我刚赔了两万  我想赚回来
I just paid out 20, and I' d like to get it back.

278
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,460
加到十万吧!  我只是个贫穷的腐败官吏
Make it 10. I'm only a poor corrupt official.

279
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,460
好吧 成交
- Okay. - Done.

280
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,040
不管他多聪明 他仍然需要一份出境许可证
No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa.

281
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,040
或许我该说是两份
Or I should say two.

282
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,130
为什么是两份?  他跟一位女士一起旅行
- Why two? - He is traveling with a lady.

283
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,280
一份他也会要的 我不认为  我看过那位女士
- He'll take one. - I think not. I' ve seen the lady.

284
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,010
如果他没把她留在马赛或奥朗
And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran...

285
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,640
肯定不会把她留在卡萨布兰卡
...he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

286
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,980
或许他没有你那么浪漫
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

287
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,420
都一样  他不会拿到出境证
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

288
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,650
是什么使你觉得我可能有兴趣 帮忙拉斯路逃亡
What ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape?

289
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,190
因为  亲爱的瑞克 我怀疑在那愤世嫉俗的外表下
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell...

290
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,100
你的内心是个性情中人
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

291
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,810
你要笑随便你 不过我凑巧熟知你的记录
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.

292
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,000
让我举出两项
Let me point out just two items:

293
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,410
在1935年 你运枪械到衣索匹亚
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

294
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,410
在1936年  你在西班牙 替反佛朗哥派打仗
In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.

295
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,910
二次我都得到丰厚的酬劳
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

296
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,420
胜方本可以给你更好的酬劳
The winning side would have paid you much better.

297
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,820
或许吧
Maybe.

298
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,090
似乎你坚决 要把拉斯路留在这里
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here.

299
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,060
我奉命行事
I have my orders.

300
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,690
我明白了  德国秘密警察
I see. Gestapo spank.

301
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,700
亲爱的瑞克 你高估了秘密警察的影响力了
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo.

302
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,230
我不干涉他们 他们也不干涉我
I don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me.

303
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,530
在卡萨布兰卡 我掌握自己的命运
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

304
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,830
史查沙少校来了  长官
- I am... - Major Strasser is here, sir.

305
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,270
才刚说完 失陪
- You were saying? - Excuse me.

306
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,360
卡尔 给史查沙少校最好的位子 靠近女士们的
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies.

307
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,350
我已经给他最好的了
I have already given him the best,

308
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,050
知道他是德国人 反正他一定接受
knowing he is German and would take it anyway.

309
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,470
静静地逮捕的 每个门口派两个守卫
Take him quietly. Two guards at every door.

310
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,300
一切都准备好了  长官 去吧
- Everything is ready, sir. - Go ahead.

311
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,380
晚安  先生 晚安  队长
- Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, captain.

312
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,570
要一块坐吗?  谢谢
- Wort you join us? - Thank you.

313
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,420
很荣幸你光临本店 香槟和鱼子酱
- It 's a pleasure to have you here, major. - Champagne and a tin of caviar.

314
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,530
容我推荐华提可 很好的法国酒
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26, a good French wine.

315
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,090
谢谢 好的  先生
Very well, sir.

316
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,730
很有趣的俱乐部 特别是今晚  长官
- A very interesting club. - Especially so tonight, major.

317
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,430
在几分钟后你将会看到 那个谋杀你快递员的人
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.

318
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,090
我正期待如此  队长
I expected no less, captain.

319
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,930
尤佳迪先生
Monsieur Ugarte.

320
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,970
请你跟我们走!  当然
- Will you please come with us? - Certainly.

321
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,580
我可否先把筹码换回现金?
May I first please cash my chips?

322
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,490
运气不错呢 两千  麻烦你 两千
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

323
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,180
瑞克  瑞克  救我
Rick! Rick, help me!

324
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:25,240
别傻了  你逃不掉的 瑞克  把我藏起来  想办法
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away. - But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

325
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,460
非常好  队长
Excellent, captain.

326
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,290
当他们来抓我时 希望你多尽点力
When they come for me, I hope you'll be more of a help.

327
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,560
我不为任何人冒险
I stick my neck out for nobody.

328
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,700
很抱歉有点骚乱  各位 不过全过去了  一切平安无事
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now.

329
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,070
尽管坐下来  尽情享受 好了  山姆 好的  老板
Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

330
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,580
瑞克  这位是第三帝国的 海米勒史查沙少校
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.

331
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,690
你好吗?  瑞克先生 你好吗?
- How do you do, Mr. Rick? - How do you do?

332
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,980
你已经认识的 第三帝国的哈斯先生
You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

333
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,660
请一块坐  瑞克先生
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

334
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,820
今晚我们非常荣幸
We are very honored tonight.

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,160
第三帝国的名声 部分是史查沙少校的功劳
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

336
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,300
他一直重复第三帝国 好像你预料会有别的一样
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others.

337
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,100
少校  私底下我会来者不拒
Well, personally, major, I will take what comes.

338
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,270
你介意我问你一些问题吗?
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

339
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,080
当然  非正式的 如果你喜欢大可正式的问
- Unofficially, of course. - Make it official if you like.

340
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,440
你的国籍是什么?  我是个醉酒鬼
- What is your nationality? - I' m a drunkard.

341
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,440
那使瑞克成为世界公民
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world.

342
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,280
我在纽约市出生 如果这对你有帮助
I was born in New York City, if that'll help you any.

343
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,020
我知道你在巴黎被占领时 从巴黎来到这里
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.

344
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,960
那似乎不是什么秘密
There seems to be no secret about that.

345
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,400
你是不是那些无法想像心爱的巴黎
Are you one of those people...

346
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
被德国人进占的人其中之一
...who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

347
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,730
我没有特别钟情巴黎
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

348
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,800
你能想像我们占据伦敦吗?
Can you imagine us in London?

349
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,410
你到那里之后再问我吧
When you get there, ask me.

350
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,070
有外交手腕
Diplomatist.

351
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
那纽约呢?
How about New York?

352
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,470
在纽约有某些区域  我不会建议你尝试侵入
There are sections of New York, major that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

353
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,980
你认为谁会打胜仗?  我一点也不清楚
- Who do you think will win the war? - I haven't the slightest idea.

354
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,820
瑞克对一切都采中立态度
Rick is completely neutral about everything.

355
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,660
他并非一直那么小心保持中立 我们有你的完整档案
You were not always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.

356
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,160
理查宾勒  美国人  三十七岁 不能返回本国
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37. Cannot return to his country."

357
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,000
原因有点含糊 我们也知道你在巴黎做什么
The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris.

358
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,670
也知道你为何离开巴黎  别担心  我们不会拿去广播
And also we know why you left Paris. Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

359
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:07,820
对女人方面也一样
And that takes in the field of women too.

360
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,240
我的眼睛真的是棕色吗?
Are my eyes really brown?

361
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,410
请原谅我的好奇心  宾勒先生  重点是
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is...

362
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,040
帝国的一位敌人 已来到卡萨布兰卡
...an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca...

363
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,180
我们正查问任何能帮我们的人
...and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.

364
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,410
我对拉斯路去留与否的兴趣 纯粹是赌博的关系
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

365
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,520
这样说来 你对奸诈的狐狸毫不同情
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox?

366
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,300
不特别同情 我也了解猎犬的立场
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too.

367
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,230
维多拉斯路在布拉格的报纸 刊登最无耻的谎言
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers...

368
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,070
一直到我们进占那一天 甚至在之后还有
...until the day we marched in.

369
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:24,330
他在一地窖中 继续印毁损的传单
And even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

370
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,370
当然  不得不承认他勇气可嘉
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.

371
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,850
我承认他很聪明 在巴黎他三次逃过我们的掌心
I admit he's clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers.

372
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,950
他继续他的活动 我们决意不让这种事再发生
In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.

373
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,650
对不起  你们的生意是政治 而我的生意是经营酒馆
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics, mine is running a saloon.

374
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,550
晚安  宾勒先生
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

375
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,690
你看到了  少校 瑞克你一点也不必担心
You see, major? You have nothing to worry about Rick.

376
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,460
或许吧
Perhaps.

377
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,870
我订了一个位子  维多拉斯路  -拉斯路先生  这边走
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo. - Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

378
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,200
两杯"君度"  麻烦你
Two Cointreaux, please.

379
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,970
我没看到尤佳迪形容的人
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

380
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,230
维多 我感觉我们不该留在这里
Victor, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

381
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,370
如果我们现在走出去 只会引人注目
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us.

382
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,740
或许尤佳迪在咖啡馆的另一边
Perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the cafe.

383
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,240
对不起  你们像是 正要前往美国的夫妇
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.

384
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,020
在那里这戒指会有市场
You'll find a market there for this ring.

385
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
我被迫卖掉它是个巨大的牺牲
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

386
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,220
谢谢  我没想过买  或许买给女士
- Thank you, but I hardly think... - Perhaps for the lady.

387
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,590
这戒指独一无二
The ring is quite unique.

388
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,560
好  我很感兴趣 好
- Yes, I' m very interested. - Good.

389
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,690
你叫什么名字?
What is your name?

390
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,200
贝加  挪威人  听候差遣
Berger, Norwegian. At your service, sir.

391
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,700
维多

392
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,970
几分钟后我在酒吧跟你会面
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.

393
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,740
不  我不想买戒指 谢谢你给我们看
We don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us.

394
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,610
那么便宜  不过你决定了 对不起  我决定了
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision? - I' m sorry, it is.

395
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,910
是拉斯路先生吗?  是
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not? - Yes?

396
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,090
我是雷诺队长  警察首长
I am Captain Renault, prefect of police.

397
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,450
是  你想要什么?
Yes, what is it you want?

398
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,750
我欢迎你来到卡萨布兰卡 并祝你在这里住得愉快
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay.

399
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,650
我们并不常有这么特出的访客
It isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor.

400
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,290
谢谢  我希望你原谅我  队长
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

401
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,950
目前的法国行政当局 并非一直那么友善
The present French administration hasn't always been so cordial.

402
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,070
容我介绍伊莎琳小姐
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

403
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,740
我听说你是卡萨布兰卡有史以来最美丽的女访客
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

404
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,700
那是粗略又保守的说法
That was a gross understatement.

405
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,160
你太客气了
You're very kind.

406
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,510
－一起坐吧 -如果你准许我
- Wort you join us? - Lf you will permit me.

407
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,950
艾米  给我一瓶最好的香槟 记在我的帐上
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your best champagne. And put it on my bill.

408
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,310
好的，先生 队长

409
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,690
先生  这是我们玩的一种游戏
It's a game we play.

410
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,690
他们记在帐单上 我撕毁帐单非常方便
They put it on the bill, I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

411
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,320
队长  弹琴的那个人
Captain, the boy who's playing the piano...

412
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,460
我好像在那里看过
Somewhere I' ve seen him.

413
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,150
山姆?  是
- Sam? - Yes.

414
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,090
他跟瑞克一起从巴黎来
He came from Paris with Rick.

415
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,730
瑞克?  他是谁?
Rick? Who is he?

416
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,500
女士  你正在瑞克咖啡馆 瑞克是... 他是什么?
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is... - Is what?

417
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,900
女士  他是那种... 如果我是女人的话
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if I were a woman...

418
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,670
我应该会爱上他的男人
...and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick.

419
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,370
我真是个傻瓜 我对一位美丽女人说别的男人
But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.

420
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,870
失陪 少校
Excuse me. Major.

421
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,620
林小姐 拉斯路先生  让我介绍 海米勒史查沙少校
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Strasser.

422
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,710
你好吗?
How do you do?

423
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,890
我盼望这份荣幸很久了
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.

424
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,620
我肯定你会原谅我不够亲切
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I' m not gracious.

425
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,960
不过你明白  史查沙少校 我是捷克人
You see, Major Strasser, I am a Czechoslovakian.

426
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,930
你以前的捷克人 现在 你是第三帝国统治下的人民
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

427
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,030
我从不曾接受这份优待 而现在我站在法国的土地上
I have never accepted that privilege. And I' m now on French soil.

428
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,870
我想跟你讨论一下 你在法国土地上引起的问题
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.

429
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,670
时间和地点都不太适当
This is hardly the time or place.

430
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,380
那我们另订时间和地点好了 明天十点在首长的办公室
Then we shall state another time and place. Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

431
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,710
好吗?  小姐
With mademoiselle.

432
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,410
雷诺队长  我在你管辖之下
Captain, I am under your authority.

433
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,620
到你的办公室是你的命令吗?
Is it your order that we come to your office?

434
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,730
让我说这是我的请求好了 那样的字眼比较好听
Let us say it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.

435
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,230
好吧 小姐
Very well.

436
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,400
后会有期

437
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,430
很聪明的策略性让步  少校
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

438
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,140
这一次他们决意要阻止我 维多  我替你感到害怕
- This time they really mean to stop me. - Victor, I' m afraid for you.

439
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,810
我们以前也曾身处困境 不是吗?
We've been in difficult places before, haven't we?

440
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,050
我必须查出贝加知道的事
I must find out what Berger knows.

441
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,440
小心点 我会
- Be careful. - I will. Don't worry.

442
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,530
贝加先生 那戒指我可以再看吗?  可以 先生
Monsieur Berger, the ring. Could I see it again?

443
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,130
请来一杯香槟鸡尾酒
Champagne cocktail, please.

444
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,700
我从报上的照片认得你的相貌 拉斯路先生
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

445
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,850
在集中营里想不消瘦也很难
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

446
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,980
我们看过五次报导你被杀死 在五个不同的地方
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.

447
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,050
每一次都是真实的
As you see, it was true every single time.

448
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,740
谢天谢地  我找到你  贝加
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

449
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,020
我在找一个叫尤佳迪的人 他预定是要帮我的
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

450
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,420
尤佳迪自身难保
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

451
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,330
他因谋杀罪被逮捕了 他今晚在这里被捕的
He's under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.

452
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,560
我明白了
I see.

453
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,300
不过我们还是自由之身 我们可以尽力 我们有组织
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized.

454
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,500
在地下  就像其他地方一样
Underground, like everywhere else.

455
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,510
明天晚上有一个会议
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.

456
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,510
如果你会来... 先生
If you will come...

457
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,360
可否请弹钢琴的过来一下?
Will you ask the piano player to come over here?

458
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,660
好的  小姐
Very well, mademoiselle.

459
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,200
珠宝生意如何?  贝加 不太好  请替我结帐
- How's the jewelry business, Berger? - Not so good. Check, please.

460
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,640
真可惜你不早点来这里
Too bad you werert here earlier.

461
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,640
今天晚上我们有一点刺激呢?  对不对?  贝加
We had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

462
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,230
对  失陪
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

463
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,480
我的帐单 不用 两杯香槟鸡尾酒  拜托
- My bill. - No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

464
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,780
哈罗  山姆 哈罗  小姐
- Hello, Sam. - Hello, Miss llsa.

465
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,450
我从没想过会再看到你
I never expected to see you again.

466
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,890
已经很久了
It's been a long time.

467
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,060
是的  小姐 过去的事有如逝水
Yes, ma'am. Alot of water under the bridge.

468
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,390
来一些旧日的歌  山姆 是  小姐
- Some of the old songs, Sam. - Yes, ma'am.

469
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,910
瑞克在那里?
Where is Rick?

470
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,010
我不知道  我整晚没看到他
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

471
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,250
他什么时候回来?  今晚不会  他不会回来
- When will he be back? - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

472
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,310
他回家了
He went home.

473
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,710
他常常这么早就走吗?  他从不
- Does he always leave so early? - He never...

474
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,260
他有位女友在蓝鹦鹉
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

475
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,550
他常常上那儿
Goes up there all the time.

476
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,790
你以前比较会撒谎  山姆
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

477
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,730
别去打扰他  伊莎小姐 你为他带来恶运
Leave him alone, Miss llsa. You're bad luck to him.

478
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,880
弹一次  山姆  看在往日份上
Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.

479
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,440
我不知道你是什么意思?  伊莎小姐
I don't know what you mean, Miss llsa.

480
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,540
弹吧  山姆
Play it, Sam.

481
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,540
弹"时光飞逝"
Play "As Time Goes By."

482
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,950
我记不起来了  伊莎小姐 我有点生锈了
I can't remember it, Miss llsa. I'm a little rusty on it.

483
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,990
我替你哼调子
I'll hum it for you.

484
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,070
唱出来  山姆
Sing it, Sam.

485
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,980
山姆 我想我告诉过你永远别弹
Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

486
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,600
你刚才问及瑞克  他来了 林小姐  让我来介绍
Well, you were asking about Rick, and here he is. May I present...

487
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,100
哈罗  伊莎 哈罗  瑞克
- Hello, llsa. - Hello, Rick.

488
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,900
你已经认识瑞克了  小姐 那  或许你也...
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

489
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,340
这位是拉斯路先生
This is Mr. Laszlo.

490
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,910
你好吗?  你好
- How do you do? - How do you do?

491
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,370
在卡萨布兰卡听到很多你的事
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

492
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,540
而维多拉斯路的事到处可闻
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

493
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,950
跟我们喝一杯好吗?  不  瑞克从不...
- Wort you join us for a drink? - Rick never...

494
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,020
谢谢  我会
- Thanks, I will. - Well...

495
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,020
一项惯例打破了  艾米!
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

496
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,380
这是很别致的咖啡馆 我恭喜你 我恭喜你
- Interesting cafe. I congratulate you. - I congratulate you.

497
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,980
为了什么?  你的工作
- What for? - Your work.

498
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,890
谢谢  我尽力而为
Thank you. I try.

499
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,700
人家都尽力而为  而你成功了
We all try. You succeed.

500
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,900
我不太明白你们两个 她早先在问关于你的事
She was asking about you earlier,

501
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,500
那种态度使我非常嫉妒
Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.

502
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,130
我不肯定是你
I wasrt sure you were the same.

503
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,410
我想想看 我们最后一次见面是 "美丽的晨晕"
- Let's see, the last time we met... - Was La Belle Aurore.

504
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,280
太好了  你记得
How nice. You remembered.

505
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,240
不过那天正好是德国军队 开进巴黎的日子
But, of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

506
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,280
不容易忘记的日子 不容易
Not an easy day to forget.

507
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:42,120
我记得每一个细节 德国人穿灰色  你穿蓝色
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

508
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,120
对  我把那件衣服收起来了
Yes. I put that dress away.

509
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,660
当德国人撤离后  我会再穿
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.

510
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,270
瑞克  你变得较人性化了 我猜我们必须感谢你
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that.

511
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,600
伊莎  我不想扫兴 不过时候不早了
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.

512
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,540
的确是  在卡萨布兰卡有戒严
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.

513
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,740
警察首长可不能被发现喝醉酒神智不清
It would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours.

514
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,180
我希望你不介意 一点也不
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome. - Not at all.

515
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,180
你的帐单  先生 让我付 我请客
- Your check, sir. - It 's my party.

516
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,890
又一个惯例打破了 这是一个很有趣的晚上
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening.

517
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,990
我替你叫计程车 在晚上汽油要配给
I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.

518
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,890
我们会再来 随时欢迎
- We'll come again. - Anytime.

519
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,120
替我跟山姆说晚安 我会
- Say good night to Sam for me. - I will.

520
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,120
世界上没有人能像山姆那样 弹"时光飞逝"
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

521
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,170
他有好久没弹这首歌了
He hasn't played it in a long time.

522
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,710
晚安 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

523
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,430
晚安
Night.

524
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,780
这个瑞克叫人莫名其妙 他是什么人?
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he?

525
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,220
我也说不上来 虽然在巴黎我常看到他
I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.

526
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,060
明天十点在首长的办公室 我们会去的 晚安
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office. - We'll be there.

527
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,850
晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

528
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,190
老板
Boss?

529
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,800
老板 是
- Boss? - Yeah?

530
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,570
你要不要上床睡?  现在不要
- Boss, ain't you going to bed? - Not right now.

531
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,480
你会在短时间内上床睡吗?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?

532
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,800
晚一点你会上床睡吗?  不
- You ever going to bed? - No.

533
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,480
我也不困
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

534
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,840
好  来喝一杯吧
Good, then have a drink.

535
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,990
不  我不要  老板 那就别喝
- Not me, boss. - Then don't have a drink.

536
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,680
老板  我们离开这里吧
Boss, let's get out of here.

537
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,410
不  山姆  我在等一位女士
No, sir. I' m waiting for a lady.

538
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,190
拜托  我们走吧 这里除了麻烦之外什么也没有
Please, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

539
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,400
她回来了  我知道她回来了
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.

540
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,260
我们开车去  开一整个晚上
We'll take the car and drive all night.

541
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,300
我们去喝酒 我们也可去钓鱼  躲开一下 直到她离开
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone.

542
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,410
闭嘴  回家去好吗?  不  先生  我要留在这里
- Shut up and go home, will you? - No, sir, I' m staying right here.

543
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,840
他们抓了尤佳迪 然后她走进来
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

544
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,940
自然法则  一进一出
That's the way it goes. One in, one out.

545
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,010
山姆 是的  老板
- Sam. - Yes, boss?

546
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,360
卡萨布兰卡现在是1941年12月  在纽约是什么时候?
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?

547
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,560
什么?
What?

548
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,130
我的手表停了
My watch stopped.

549
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,160
我打赌在纽约他们都睡着了
I bet they're asleep in New York.

550
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,100
我打赌全美国的人都睡着了
I bet they're asleep all over America.

551
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,070
全世界有那么多城镇 有那么多酒吧
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world...

552
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,240
她就走进我这一家
...she walks into mine.

553
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,560
你在弹什么?  只是我随便乱弹的
- What's that you're playing? - A little something of my own.

554
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,590
停  你知道我想听什么 不  我不知道
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear. - No, I don't.

555
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,720
你能为她弹  你也能为我弹
You played it for her. You can play it for me.

556
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,200
我想我记不起来 如果她受得了  我也可以
- I don't think I can remember... - lf she can stand it, I can.

557
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,290
弹!
Play it.

558
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,800
是的  老板
Yes, boss.

559
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,160
你到底是什么人?  你以前是什么?
Who are you really? And what were you before?

560
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,100
你是做什么的?  你又想些什么?
What did you do, and what did you think?

561
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,130
我们说过不准问问题
We said no questions.

562
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,800
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

563
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,540
一法O买你的心事
A franc for your thoughts.

564
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,140
在美国他们只出一分钱
In America they'd bring only a penny.

565
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,550
我猜大概只值这么多
I guess that's about all they're won'th.

566
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,090
我愿意被超额收费 告诉我
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

567
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,810
我在想...
Well, I was wondering...

568
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,490
为什么我那么幸运?
Why I'm so lucky.

569
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,890
为什么你会在那里等着我出现  正巧又被我找到
Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

570
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,330
为什么我的生命中 没有别的男人?
Why there is no other man in my life?

571
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,900
那很简单  以前有
That's easy. There was.

572
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,400
他死了
He's dead.

573
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,240
对不起我问了
I'm sorry for asking.

574
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,310
我忘了我们说过不准问问题
I forgot we said no questions.

575
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,820
只有一个答案 能解答我们所有的问题
Only one answer can take care of all our questions.

576
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,020
“巴黎”

577
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,380
这里是德国人史特格

578
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,320
法国人，巴黎人

579
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,950
法国军队已放弃他们的岗位

580
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,430
德国人已要求进入首都

581
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,520
现在什么也阻止不了他们了
Nothing can stop them now.

582
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,520
星期三  最迟星期四 他们便会来巴黎
Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

583
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,670
理查  如果他们发现你的过去 你留在这里便不安全了
Richard, they'll find out your record. You won't be safe here.

584
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,940
我早已在他们的黑名单上了 荣誉栏上
I'm on their blacklist already. Their roll of honor.

585
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,390
亨利要我们喝完这一瓶
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.

586
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:07,430
还有三瓶他要用来浇花 也不让德国人喝
Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.

587
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,020
这可以减轻被占领的苦恼 你说是不是?  理查先生
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?

588
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,330
你说对了
You said it.

589
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,470
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

590
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:28,040
(德语)

591
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,720
我的德语有点生锈了
My Germars a little rusty.

592
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,590
是秘密警察
It's the Gestapo.

593
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,370
他们说预计明天到巴黎
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.

594
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,010
他们在教我们当他们进来时 该如何反应
They're telling us how to act when they come marching in.

595
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,280
整个世界快倒下来了 我们却挑上这时候来谈恋爱
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

596
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,140
对  真不巧
It's pretty bad timing.

597
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,280
在十年前的话  你会说什么?  十年前?
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago? - 10 years ago?

598
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,160
我想想看
Let's see.

599
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,890
我还带着牙套 那时候你在那儿?
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?

600
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,420
正在找工作
Looking for a job.

601
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,630
那是炮火吗?
Was that cannon fire?

602
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,070
还是我的心在跳?
Or is it my heart pounding?

603
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,940
那是新的德国77型 单以声音来判断 大约只有35哩远
It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

604
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,810
越来越近了
And getting closer every minute.

605
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:39,110
来  来  喝光
Here, here, drink up.

606
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,680
另外那三瓶我们喝不完了
We'll never finish the other three.

607
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,380
德国人很快就会到了 他们会来找你
Them Germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you.

608
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,620
别忘了拿下你有悬赏
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.

609
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:50,790
我在公寓留有字条 他们知道到那里能找到我
Ileft a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me.

610
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,630
奇怪
It's strange.

611
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,400
我对你了解得那么少  我对你的了解更少
- I know so very little about you. - I know very little about you.

612
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,770
只知道你矫正过牙齿
Just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

613
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,940
认真点  亲爱的  你有危险 你一定要离开巴黎
Be serious, darling. You are in danger. You must leave Paris.

614
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,270
不  不  我们一定要离开
No, we must leave.

615
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,680
对  当然是我们
Yes, of course. We.

616
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,610
往马赛的火车五点开出 我四点半到你的饭店接你
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00. I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

617
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:15,250
不  不要在我饭店  我...
Not at my hotel. I...

618
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,090
在我离开前我在城里有事要办
I have things to do in the city before I leave.

619
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,820
我会在火车站跟你碰面
I'll meet you at the station.

620
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,220
好吧  四点四十五分
All right, at a quarter to 5.

621
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,290
我们何不在马赛结婚
Why don't we get married in Marseilles?

622
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,800
现在计划不嫌太遥远吗?
That's too far ahead to plan.

623
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,640
对  我猜是远了点
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

624
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,180
那火车上的列车长如何
Let's see... What about the engineer?

625
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,180
他可以在火车上替我们主持婚礼
Why can't he marry us on the train?

626
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,440
亲爱的 为什么不?  船上的船长可以 似乎有点不公平
Why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that...

627
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,520
怎么了?  孩子
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

628
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,350
我那么爱你
Llove you so much.

629
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:59,500
而我那么痛恨这战争
And I hate this war so much.

630
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,200
这是个疯狂的世界 任何事都可能发生
It's a crazy world. Anything can happen.

631
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,810
万一如果你不能离开
If you shouldn't get away...

632
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,710
我是说  万一我们被分开
If something should keep us apart...

633
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,710
不管他们把你安置在那里
...wherever they put you...

634
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,150
不管我会在那里 我要你知道我...
...and wherever I' II be, I want you to know that I...

635
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,990
吻我
Kiss me.

636
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,330
有如最后一次般吻我
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

637
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,200
上车!  上车!

638
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:45,270
注意!  上车!

639
00:46:53,490 --> 00:47:02,330
所有乘客上车 最后一班火车在三分钟后开出

640
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,230
快点，上车!  最后一班火车!

641
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,800
她在那里?  你有看到她吗?
Where is she? Have you seen her?

642
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,700
不  理查先生  我找不到她 她已经退了房间
I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel.

643
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,760
不过你刚离开后送来这字条
But this note came just after you left.

644
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,600
“亲爱的理查”

645
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,340
“我不能跟你走或是再见你”

646
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,780
“你不要问为什么”

647
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,370
“只要相信我爱你”

648
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,000
“给我的爱人愿上帝祝福你”

649
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,340
“伊莎”

650
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,610
那是最后的召唤  理查先生
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

651
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,860
你听到我说吗?
Do you hear me?

652
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:34,090
快点  我们离开这里再说 快点  理查先生  快点
Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on.

653
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,980
瑞克  我必须跟你谈一下
Rick, I have to talk to you.

654
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,290
我把第一杯留下来跟你一起喝 在这儿
I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

655
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,980
不  不  瑞克  今晚不行 特别是今晚
- No, Rick. Not tonight. - Especially tonight.

656
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,950
为什么你一定要来卡萨布兰卡 还有很多别的地方
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.

657
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,560
如果我知道你在这里 我就不会来
I wouldn't have come if I' d known you were here.

658
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,260
相信我  那是真的 我并不知道
Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

659
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,000
奇怪的是你的声音 一点都没变 我仍然听得到
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

660
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,100
亲爱的理查 我会随你到天涯海角
"Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace.

661
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:55,740
我们一起坐上火车 一路不停 别这样  瑞克
- We'll get on a train and never stop." - Don't, Rick.

662
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,640
我明白你的感受
I can understand how you feel.

663
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,640
你明白我的感受
You understand how I feel.

664
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,110
我们相叙的日子有多长?  亲爱的
How long was it we had, honey?

665
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,250
我没有数 我有
- I didn't count the days. - Well, I did.

666
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:07,990
每一天都有
Every one of them.

667
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,560
最后一天我记得最清楚
Mostly I remember the last one.

668
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,320
当汽笛声响过后 月台上有一个人站在雨中
The wild finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain...

669
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,220
脸上挂着可笑的表情
...with a comical look on his face...

670
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,370
因为他的内心被踢翻了
...because his insides have been kicked out.

671
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:23,560
瑞克 我可否说一个故事给你听?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

672
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,230
结局也有汽笛声吗?
Does it got a wild finish?

673
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,570
我还不知道结局
I don't know the finish yet.

674
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,180
那就说出来 或许一边说可以一边想
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come to you as you go along.

675
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,410
是有关一位女孩 她刚从科斯鲁来到巴黎
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo.

676
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,310
在一个朋友的家里
At the house of some friends...

677
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,350
她遇到她听闻了一辈子的男人
...she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life.

678
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,720
一个伟大又勇敢的男人
A very great and courageous man.

679
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,390
他为她揭开一个由知识
He opened up for her a whole beautiful world...

680
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,160
思想和理想组成的美丽世界
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

681
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,430
她知道的一切  她的成长 都是由于他的关系
Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.

682
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,370
她景仰他
And she looked up to him...

683
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,110
崇拜他
...and worshiped him...

684
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,110
她假定那就是爱的感觉
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

685
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,400
对  很美
Yes, that's very pretty.

686
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,350
我也听过一个故事 事实上在我的年代也听过很多故事
I heard a story once. In fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

687
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:12,250
都由细小的钢琴叮叮声伴奏
They went along with the sound of a tinny piano...

688
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,120
就在楼下的大厅弹奏
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

689
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:20,220
先生  我小时候有一次 遇上一个男人  开始总是这样
"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

690
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,330
我猜我们的故事都不怎么有趣
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.

691
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,560
告诉我
Tell me...

692
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,590
你是为了谁离开我?
...who was it you left me for?

693
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,640
是拉斯路 还是中间还有别的人
Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between...

694
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,710
或者你是不会说出来的人
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

695
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:01,430
(雷诺队长，警察首长)

696
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,560
我极端怀疑尤佳迪先生 把过境信函留下给宾勒先生了
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

697
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,140
我建议立刻彻底搜查咖啡馆
I would suggest you search the cafe immediately.

698
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,510
如果信函在瑞克手上 他那么聪明你不可能找到的
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there.

699
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,600
你太夸奖他的聪明
You give him credit for too much cleverness.

700
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,410
我的印象他不过是另一个 莽撞的美国人
My impression was he's just another blundering American.

701
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,610
你不要低估美国人的莽撞
We mustrt underestimate American blundering.

702
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,750
1918年 当他们莽撞进入柏林时
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.

703
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,960
我跟他们在一起呢 至于拉斯路 我要派人24小时监视
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day.

704
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,830
你可能会感兴趣想知道 此刻他正在来这里的途中
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here.

705
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,530
我们没办法
There is nothing we can do.

706
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,210
很高兴看到你们  你们有充分休息吗 ?
I'm delighted to see you. Did you have a good night's rest?

707
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,380
我睡得很好
I slept very well.

708
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,140
奇怪  在卡萨布兰卡 不应该有人会睡得好的
Strange. Nobody's supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

709
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,310
我们可否进行正事?  非常乐意  请坐下 谢谢
- May we proceed with the business? - With pleasure. Wort you sit down?

710
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,980
好吧  我们坦白说好了 你是第三帝国的逃犯
Laszlo, we will not mince words. You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

711
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,390
到目前为止你成功躲过我们
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us.

712
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,350
你抵达了卡萨布兰卡
You have reached Casablanca.

713
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,320
我有责任确保 你留在卡萨布兰卡
It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.

714
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,620
你是否会成功当然仍是问题 一点也没
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic.

715
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,770
每张出境许可 都需雷诺队长签名
Not at all. Renault 's signature is necessary on every visa.

716
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:11,460
队长  你认为拉斯路 可能获得出境证吗
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa?

717
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,970
我恐怕不会 我表示抱歉  先生
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

718
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,200
或许我会喜欢留在卡萨布兰卡
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

719
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,540
那小姐呢?
And mademoiselle?

720
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,310
你不必为我操心  你们想告诉我们的就是这些
- You needrt be concerned about me. - Is that all you wish to tell us?

721
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,350
别急  你的时间多的是
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world.

722
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,180
你可能无限期留在卡萨布兰卡
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

723
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,290
或许你可能明天前往里斯本
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

724
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,650
在一个条件之下 是什么?
- On one condition. - And that is?

725
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,120
你知道各地地下组织首领是谁 在巴黎  布拉格
You know the leader of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague...

726
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:36,930
布鲁赛尔  阿姆斯特丹
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

727
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:40,260
奥斯陆 贝尔格勒  雅典
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

728
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,860
甚至在柏林 对  甚至在柏林
- Even Berlin. - Yes, even in Berlin.

729
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,700
如果你提供我他们的名字 和确实的行踪
If you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts...

730
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,640
你便可以在早上得到出境签证
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

731
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,570
并且分享 为第三帝国服务的荣誉
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

732
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,470
我在德国集中营待过一年
I was in a German concentration camp for a year.

733
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,140
那份荣誉够享用一辈子了 你会给我们那些名字吗?
- That's honor enough for a lifetime. - You will give us the names?

734
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,440
如果在集中营时我没有给你们
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp...

735
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:04,590
在那儿 你能随意用更有说服力的方法
...where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal...

736
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,350
现在我当然不会给你了
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

737
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,230
如果你查获这些杀了他们呢?
And what if you track down these men and kill them?

738
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,920
如果你谋杀我们全部又怎样?
What if you murdered all of us?

739
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:16,570
在欧洲的每个角落 有上千人会崛起 取代我们的位置
From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.

740
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,000
即使纳粹党也不能杀得完
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

741
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,110
拉斯路  你以能言善辩著称
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.

742
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,540
我现在体会到 不过有点你说错
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

743
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,170
你说第三帝国所有的敌人都可以取代
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced.

744
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,870
不过有一个例外
But there is one exception.

745
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,710
没有人能取代你的位置
No one could take your place ...

746
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,790
或防止在你逃走时发生的不幸
if anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.

747
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,490
你不敢在这里阻挡我
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

748
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,180
这里仍然是未被占领的法国
This is still unoccupied France.

749
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,530
任何违法的举动 都会影响雷诺队长的声誉
Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

750
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,470
目前为止仍然在我控制之下 谢谢 对了  先生
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power. - Thank you.

751
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,860
昨晚你表示 对尤佳迪先生感兴趣
By the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

752
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,170
我相信你有口信传给他
I believe you have a message for him?

753
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,600
没有什么重要的事 不过我现在可以跟他谈话吗?
Nothing important. But may I speak to him now?

754
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,140
你会发现谈话是单向的
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided.

755
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,210
尤佳迪先生死了
Signor Ugarte is dead.

756
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,310
我正在写报告
I'm making out the report now.

757
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,590
我们还没决定他到底是自杀
We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide...

758
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,990
或者企图逃走时死去
...or died trying to escape.

759
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,960
你们问完我们了吗?  暂时是的
- Are you quite finished with us? - For the time being.

760
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,660
日安
Good day.

761
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,700
毫无疑问他们下一步是找黑市
Undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market.

762
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,900
对不起  队长
Excuse me, captain.

763
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:33,100
出现了另一件签证问题
Another visa problem has come up.

764
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,480
带她进来 是的
- Show her in. - Yes, sir.

765
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,180
对不起  先生 我们应付不了警察
Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.

766
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,360
这件事找法拉利先生才对  法拉利
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari. - Ferrari?

767
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,570
认识法拉利会很有帮助
It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari.

768
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,290
他独占了这里的黑市买卖
He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here.

769
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,560
你在那边的蓝鹦鹉可以找到他
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

770
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,900
谢谢
Thanks.

771
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,150
不要太灰心
Don't be too downearted.

772
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,410
或许你可以与雷诺队长 取得协议
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

773
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,920
谢谢  先生 哈罗  法拉利
Thank you very much, signor.

774
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,590
早  瑞克
- Hello, Ferrari. - Good morning, Rick.

775
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,960
我看到巴士到了 我把我买的货一起带走
The bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

776
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,430
别急  我会叫人送去
I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.

777
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,530
跟我喝一杯吧 早上我不喝酒的
I never drink in the morning.

778
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,530
每次你送来给我的货 都短少了一点
And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.

779
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,640
搬运费  我的孩子
Carrying charges, my boy. Carrying charges.

780
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,100
来  坐下
Here, sit down.

781
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,930
反正我有些事情跟你谈
There is something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.

782
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,740
"波旁" 威士忌
Bourbon.

783
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,950
尤佳迪的新闻使我很不舒服
The news about Ugarte upsets me very much.

784
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:43,620
你是个肥肿的虚伪者 尤佳迪的死你不会比我难过多少
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

785
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,510
当然不 我难过的是尤佳迪死了
Of course not. What upsets me is that Ugarte is dead...

786
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,710
没有人知道那过境信在那里
...and no one knows where those letters are.

787
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,190
几乎没有人
Practically no one.

788
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,650
如果我得到 肯定可以赚一大笔
If I had those letters, I could make a fortune.

789
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:54,990
我也可以 我是个贫穷的生意人
So could I, and I' m a poor businessman.

790
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,430
不管在谁手上我给他一个建议
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters.

791
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,430
我来安排交易
I'll handle the entire transaction.

792
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,130
承担一切风险把信卖出
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.

793
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,900
抽少部分利润 以及搬运费?
And the carrying charges?

794
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,700
自然会有一些意外支出
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses.

795
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,810
这是我对持有信函的人提议
That's my proposition for whoever has those letters.

796
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,530
他出现时我会告诉他
I'll tell him when he comes in.

797
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:14,600
我开门见山跟你说 我认为你知道那些信在那里
Rick, I think you know where those letters are.

798
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,810
你有伴了 雷诺和史查沙大概也这样想
You're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

799
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,550
所以我才到这里 给他们机会搜索我的店
That's why I came here. To give them a chance to ransack my place.

800
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,060
别傻了  跟我说实话 你需要一个合伙人
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

801
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,160
失陪  我要回去了
Excuse me, I' II be getting back.

802
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,500
早 法拉利先生是那边桌子的肥仔
- Morning. - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

803
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,810
在全摩洛哥 你也找不到这么珍贵的东西
You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco.

804
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,310
小姐  只要七百法O
Only 700 francs.

805
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,680
你被骗了 没关系  谢谢
- You're being cheated. - Doesrt matter, thank you.

806
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,980
女士是瑞克的朋友 瑞克的朋友我们给一点折扣
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount.

807
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:57,710
我刚才说七百法O吗?  两百法O卖给你
Did I say 700 francs? You can have it for 200.

808
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,550
对不起  昨晚你来拜访时 我正处于不适合待客的状态
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.

809
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,720
没关系 瑞克的特别朋友
Doesrt matter.

810
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,930
我们有特别的折扣  一百法O
For special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. 100 francs.

811
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,140
那故事把我弄糊涂了 或者是喝多了"波旁" 吧
Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.

812
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,830
我有些桌巾  一些餐巾
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

813
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:13,310
谢谢  我真的不感兴趣  请等一会儿
- Thank you. I' m really not interested. - Please, one minute.

814
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,580
为什么你要回来呢?
Why did you come back?

815
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,700
为了告诉我你为何叫我在火车站白等  -对
To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station? -Yes.

816
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,380
你现在可以告诉我 我比较清醒了
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.

817
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,010
我想我不会说了  瑞克
I don't think I will, Rick.

818
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,650
为何不 我买了火车票进退两难
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket.

819
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,650
我想我有权利知道
I think I' m entitled to know.

820
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,850
昨晚我看到在你身上 发生了什么
Last night I saw what has happened to you.

821
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,760
在巴黎的瑞克  我可以告诉他 他能够明白
The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him, he'd understand.

822
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,490
可是用那种怨恨眼光看我的人
But the one who looked at me with such hatred...

823
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,060
我很快会离开卡萨兰加 我们永远不会再见面了
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see each other again.

824
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,260
我们在巴黎相爱的时候 我们彼此了解并不多
We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris.

825
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,610
如果我们维持那样
If we leave it that way,

826
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,610
或许我们会记住那些日子 而不是卡萨布兰卡
maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca.

827
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,840
不是昨晚
Not last night.

828
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,720
你舍我而去  因为你知道将会是什么样子
Did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?

829
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,890
逃避警察  无时无刻不在逃亡
Hiding from the police, running away all the time?

830
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,680
如果你要相信是那样随便你
You can believe that if you want to.

831
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,620
我已不再逃亡了 我安定下来了
Well, I' m not running away anymore. I'm settled now.

832
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:07,030
虽然是酒馆  不过是事实
Above a saloon, it's true...

833
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:09,300
要上飞机的话
...but walk up a flight...

834
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,120
我会算你一份
...I' II be expecting you.

835
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,000
都一样 有一天你会对拉斯路撒谎
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

836
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,900
你会去的
You'll be there.

837
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,460
不  瑞克
No, Rick.

838
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,140
不  维多拉斯路是我的丈夫
No. You see, Victor Laszlo is my husband.

839
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,740
以前也是 甚至我在巴黎认识你之前也是
And was, even when I knew you in Paris.

840
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,880
我刚才正跟拉斯路先生说  很不幸我无法帮助你们
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I' m not able to help him.

841
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,960
是这样的  亲爱的 话已传开了
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

842
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,900
身为卡萨布兰卡 所有非法活动的领导人
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca,

843
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,400
我是个有影响力和受尊重的人
I am influential and respected

844
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:48,400
替拉斯路先生做任何事 要冒生命危险并不值得
But it would not be won'th my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

845
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,330
不过你  却是另一回事
You, however, are a different matter.

846
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:55,140
法拉利先生认为有可能 替你拿到一份签证
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.

847
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,810
你是说让我单独离开 只能单独一人
- You mean for me to go on alone? - And only alone.

848
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,310
我会留在这里继续想办法 我肯定再过一阵子...
I'll stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while...

849
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,150
我还是坦白一点好  先生
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

850
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,250
需要奇迹 你才可能离开卡萨布兰卡
It would take a miracle to get you out.

851
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,250
德国人是剥夺奇迹的歹徒
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

852
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,380
我们只对两位签证感兴趣 先生
We are only interested in two visas.

853
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:13,120
拜托  伊莎  不要急躁 不  维多  不
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty. - No, Victor.

854
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,250
你们两位会想讨论这件事
You two will want to discuss this.

855
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,400
失陪  我会在酒吧
Excuse me. I' II be at the bar.

856
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,060
不  伊莎 我不能让你留在这里
No, llsa. I won't let you stay here.

857
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,730
你必须到美国去 我相信我终会逃出  跟你会合
You must get to America. Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.

858
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
维多  情况不一样
But if the situation were different...

859
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,370
如果我必须留下 只有一份签证
...if I had to stay and there were only visa for one...

860
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,840
你会要吗?
...would you take it?

861
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,140
对  我会
Yes, I would.

862
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,540
对  我明白
Yes, I see.

863
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,620
当要离开"流尔"  我遇上麻烦时
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,

864
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,620
你为什么不把我留在那儿?
why didn't you leave me there?

865
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,930
当我在马赛生病时 耽搁你两个星期
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks...

866
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,930
你无时无刻不冒着生命危险
...and you were in danger every minute...

867
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:48,820
那时候你为什么不留下我?
...why didn't you leave me then?

868
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,620
我本来要 总是有些东西阻止我
I meant to, but something always held me up.

869
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,570
我非常爱你  伊莎
Ilove you very much, llsa.

870
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,860
我会保守你的秘密
Your secret will be safe with me.

871
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,030
法拉利在等我们的答案
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

872
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,540
不能超过五十法O
Not more than 50 francs.

873
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,080
我们已经决定了  法拉利先生
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

874
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,620
从现在起我们只寻求两份签证 非常感谢你
For the present we will go on looking for two visas. Thank you very much.

875
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,760
祝你好运  务必小心
Well, good luck, but be careful.

876
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,760
你知道你被跟踪吗?  当然  已经习以为常
- You know you're being shadowed? - Of course. It becomes an instinct.

877
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:24,120
我发现在某方面来说 你是个幸运的人  先生
I observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man.

878
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,030
我觉得想再给你一个建议 为了什么我也不知道
I am moved to make one more suggestion. Why, I do not know.

879
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,100
因为你不可能给我好处
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

880
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,470
你有听闻尤佳迪先生 和过境信吗?
Have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit?

881
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,630
是  一点点
Yes, something.

882
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:37,000
他们逮捕尤佳迪时 没有在他身上找到那些信
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.

883
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,180
你知道信在那里吗?
- You know where they are? - Not for sure.

884
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,220
不过我猜尤佳迪 把信留给瑞克先生
But I'd guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

885
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,520
那瑞克有难以理解的习惯
A difficult customer, that Rick.

886
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,520
没有人知道 他会做什么及为什么
One never knows what he'll do or why.

887
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,350
不过值得试一试
But it is won'th a chance.

888
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,720
非常感谢你  日安
Thank you very much. Good day.

889
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,730
再见  谢谢你的咖啡  先生
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

890
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,730
我们离开卡萨布兰卡后 我将会怀念那咖啡
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

891
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:59,700
请你跟我分享 日安  小姐
Gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, mademoiselle.

892
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:02,300
先生 日安
- Monsieur. - Good day.

893
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,340
敬你  先生 祝好运
- Here's to you, sir. - Good luck.

894
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,250
我要走了  请给我帐单
- I'd better be going. - My check, please.

895
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,850
我必须警告你  这是个危险的地方  很多贪心的人
I have to warn you, sir. This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

896
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,720
到处是贪心的人 谢谢 再见  先生
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything. - Goodbye.

897
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,450
很荣幸认识你
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

898
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,290
对不起
I'm sorry.

899
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,840
瑞克先生 你快成为自己最好的顾客了
Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer.

900
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,250
在喝酒?  你使我很高兴
Well, drinking. I'm very pleased with you.

901
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,320
你现在开始 像法国人那样生活了
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman.

902
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,850
你的手下今天下午 来搅乱我的店
That was some going-over your men gave my place.

903
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,010
我们差点来不及清理开门营业
We barely got cleaned up in time to open.

904
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:59,450
我告诉过史查沙休不会在这里 找到那些信
I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.

905
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,750
不过我告诉我的手下 要格外有破坏力  你知道
But I told my men to be especially destructive.

906
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,860
那可叫德国人刮目相看
You know how that impresses Germans.

907
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,500
瑞克  你有那些过境信吗?
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?

908
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:09,960
你是倾向亲德还是自由法国?
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy or Free French?

909
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,060
我活该  问这直接的问题 这话题结束
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

910
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,840
似乎你晚了一步
It looks like you're a little late.

911
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,810
原来伊娃向敌人投诚了
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

912
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:30,750
谁知道  以她自己的方法 她可能组织第二条前线
Who knows? In her own way, she may constitute an entire second front.

913
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,390
我想我该去 奉承一下史查沙少校 回头见!  瑞克
I think it's time for me to flatter Strasser a little. I' II see you later.

914
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,930
沙克!
Sascha!

915
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,120
法国七十五
French 75s.

916
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:42,070
我们要一整排  沙克 从这里开始  到这里结束
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha. Starting here and ending here.

917
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,500
我们从两杯开始
We will begin with two.

918
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,960
你不是法国人吗？ (法语)

919
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,940
竟然跟这种德国人约会 关你什么事

920
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,770
你说什么?  麻烦你再说一次
What did you say? Would you kindly repeat it?

921
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,350
我说什么与你无关 我会使它变成跟我有关
- What I said is none of your business. - I' II make it my business.

922
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:03,690
停手!求求你，求求你停手

923
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,190
我不喜欢人家在我的店乱来 不抛开政治就滚出去
I don't like disturbances in my place. Either lay off politics or get out.

924
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,620
有一天，你会得到报应的

925
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,120
你看到了吧  队长
You see, captain?

926
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,770
情况并不如你想像的那么稳定
The situation is not as under control as you believe.

927
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:18,830
亲爱的少校 我们正尽量跟贵政府合作
We try to cooperate with your government.

928
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,300
我们无法规定人民的感受
But we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.

929
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,640
队长 你完全肯定你帮那一边吗
Captain, are you certain which side you're on?

930
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,100
我没有信念 如果你指这一方面
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean.

931
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:27,610
我看风转舵  目前的风向
I blow with the wind...

932
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,320
正巧从维琪(亲德)吹来
...and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

933
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,080
如果风向改了呢?
And if it should change?

934
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,510
我肯定 帝国不会承认那种可能性
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility?

935
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:36,780
我们关心的不只是卡萨布兰卡
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.

936
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:39,160
我们知道 每个在非洲的法国管区
We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

937
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,660
都布满了叛徒  正在等候机会 或许在等候一位领导人
Waiting for their chance. Waiting perhaps for a leader.

938
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,320
领导人?  像拉斯路?
Aleader? Like Laszlo?

939
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,300
我一直在想
I have been thinking.

940
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,930
让他离开太危险 但让他留下也可能太危险
It's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

941
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,090
我明白你的意思
I see what you mean.

942
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,910
(德语)

943
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,880
谢谢  卡尔 你的  太太
Thank you, Carl.

944
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,310
谢谢  卡尔
Thank you, Carl.

945
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,450
卡尔  坐下 跟我们喝杯白兰地
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

946
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,220
庆祝我们明天到美国去
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow.

947
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:08,480
非常谢谢
Thank you very much.

948
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,520
我早想到你会请我喝 所以我拿了上等的白兰地
I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy...

949
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,460
还有...高脚杯
...and a third glass.

950
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,620
终于  这一天到来了
At last the day's came!

951
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,630
从现在起我们只说英文
Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.

952
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,670
这样我们到美国后 会感觉像回到家一样
So we should feel at home when we get to America.

953
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:23,500
很不错的主意
A very nice idea.

954
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,060
为美国喝一杯
To America.

955
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,830
为美国喝一杯
To America.

956
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:36,170
亲爱的  什么表(几点了)?
What watch?

957
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,670
十个表(十点) 那么多(这么晚了)
- Ten watch. - Such much?

958
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,650
你们会在美国过得非常愉快
You will get along beautifully in America.

959
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,420
幸运女神有没有照顾你?
How is lady luck treating you?

960
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,460
真可惜
Oh, too bad.

961
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,660
他就在那边
You'll find him over there.

962
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,430
瑞克先生 是
- Monsieur Rick? - Yes?

963
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,840
我可否跟你说几句话  你怎么进来的?  你还未成年
- Could I speak to you, please? - How'd you get in here? You're underage.

964
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,470
我跟雷诺队长一起来的 我早该猜到
- I came with Captain Renault. - I should have known.

965
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:05,840
我的丈夫也跟我一起
My husband is with me too.

966
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,150
是吗?  雷诺队长思想越来开明
He is? Captain Renault 's getting broad-minded. Sit down.

967
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,020
坐下  要喝一杯吗?
Have a drink?

968
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,810
当然不喝  你介意我喝吗?  不
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

969
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,480
瑞克先生
Monsieur Rick...

970
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,850
雷诺队长是怎样的人?  就像其他的男人  或者更像
...what kind of a man is Captain Renault? - Like any other man, only more so.

971
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,950
我是说
No, I mean...

972
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:21,950
他值得信任吗?  他的话...
...is he trustwon'thy? Is his word...?

973
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,360
等一下  谁叫你来问我的?  他叫我的  雷诺队长
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? - He did. Captain Renault did.

974
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,490
我也猜到  你的丈夫呢?
I thought so. Where's your husband?

975
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:33,110
在轮盘桌那边 想要赢足够的钱 买我们的出境证
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.

976
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,000
当然他正在输钱
Oh, of course he's losing.

977
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,140
你们结婚多久了?  八个星期
- How long have you been married? - Eight weeks.

978
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,810
我们从保加利亚来
We come from Bulgaria.

979
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,640
那里的情况非常坏  先生
Things are very bad there.

980
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,010
魔鬼押着人民的脖子
The devil has the people by the throat.

981
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,940
所以犹安和我  我们...
So Jan and I, we...

982
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,820
我们不想子女在那种地方长大
We do not want our children to grow up in such a country.

983
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,560
所以你们决定去美国
- So you decided to go to America. - Yes.

984
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:57,030
对  可是我们钱不多
But we haven't much money...

985
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,600
旅费那么贵而且困难
...and traveling is so expensive and difficult.

986
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,020
来这里的花费 比我们预算高很多
It was much more than we thought to get here.

987
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,570
然后雷诺队长看到我们
And then Captain Renault sees us...

988
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:07,940
他很仁慈  他想帮我们 对  我打赌是
...and he is so kind, he wants to help us. - Yes, I' II bet.

989
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,780
他告诉我 他可以给我们出境签证
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

990
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,110
可是  我们没有钱
But we have no money.

991
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,800
他知道吗?  知道
- Does he know that? - Yes.

992
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,750
那他仍然愿意给你签证
- And he's still willing to give you a visa? - Yes.

993
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:20,940
对  先生 而你想知道... 他会不会遵守诺言?
- And you want to know...? - Will he keep his word?

994
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,650
他一直都有
He always has.

995
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,930
先生  你是一个男人
You are a man.

996
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:32,690
假设有一个人非常爱你
If someone loved you very much...

997
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,130
她只求能给你快乐
...so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world...

998
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,570
为了肯定能办到 她做了件坏事
...and she did a bad thing to make certain of it...

999
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:44,170
你会不会原谅她?  没有人曾经那么爱我
...could you forgive her? - Nobody ever loved me that much.

1000
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,250
他一直都不知道 那女孩把做过的坏事藏在心里
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart...

1001
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,140
这样不会有关系吧  会不会?
...that would be all right, wouldn't it?

1002
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,440
你要我提意见吗?  是  拜托
- You want my advice? - Yes, please.

1003
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:54,040
回到保加利亚去
Go back to Bulgaria.

1004
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:58,520
如果你知道能离开欧洲到美国 对我们有多重要
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America...

1005
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,850
如果犹安发现了 他那么孩子气
Oh, but if Jan should find out. He is such a boy.

1006
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,470
在很多方面  我比他成熟 对
In many ways I am so much older than he is.

1007
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,160
在卡萨布兰卡每个人都有困难
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems.

1008
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,400
你的困难可能会解决的  失陪 谢谢  先生
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me. - Thank you, monsieur.

1009
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,380
晚安
- Good evening. - Good evening.

1010
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:27,080
你看  我们又来了 我认为那是对山姆的恭维
- You see? Here we are again. - I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

1011
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,960
我猜对你而言他代表巴黎 那些较快乐的日子
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days.

1012
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:34,220
的确是 我们可否选择靠近他的桌子
He does. Could we have a table close to him?

1013
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,760
并且离史查沙少校越远越好
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.

1014
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,590
这样的安排可能有点困难
The geography may be a little difficult to arrange.

1015
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,530
保罗  三十号桌
- Paul, table 30. - Yes, sir.

1016
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,500
是的  先生  请往这边
Right this way, if you please.

1017
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:47,570
我叫山姆弹"时光飞逝"  我相信那是你偏爱的曲子
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's your favorite tune.

1018
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:48,940
谢谢
Thank you.

1019
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:00,980
两杯干邑(白兰地)麻烦你 干邑
- Two cognacs, please. - Cognac.

1020
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,750
下注，先生女士

1021
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,350
赌博游戏继续进行

1022
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,450
先生女士，下注

1023
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:19,700
游戏继续，下注

1024
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,640
你要不要再下注呢?  先生
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1025
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,910
不  不  我想不要了
No. No, I guess not.

1026
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,950
你今晚买过22号吗?
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1027
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,920
我说22
I said 22.

1028
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:40,930
下注，先生女士，游戏继续

1029
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,600
留在那里
Leave it there.

1030
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:02,710
下注，先生女士 游戏继续进行

1031
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:06,490
好了，不要下注 二十二

1032
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,450
拿去兑现金  不要再回来
Cash it in and don't come back.

1033
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:13,210
你肯定这地方诚实吗?
Are you sure this place is honest?

1034
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,630
诚实?  日子有多长就有多诚实
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1035
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,470
不要再下注了

1036
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,900
我们今天成绩如何?
How are we doing tonight?

1037
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:24,900
比我预料的少了几千块
A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.

1038
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,580
瑞克先生...我...
Monsieur Rick...

1039
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,240
他走运而已
He's just a lucky guy.

1040
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,850
瑞克先生 我倒杯咖啡给你好吗
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?

1041
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,080
不  谢谢  卡尔 瑞克先生
- No, thanks, Carl. - Monsieur Rick...

1042
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,080
雷诺队长  我可否...
Captain Renault, may l- -?

1043
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:54,320
在这里不行 明早到我办公室 我们依照手续
Not here. Come to my office in the morning. We'll do everything businesslike.

1044
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,630
我们会在六点到
- We'll be there at 6.

1045
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,240
我会在十点到  我很替你们高兴
- I'll be there at 10. I'm very happy for both of you.

1046
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,430
你赢钱有一点奇怪
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1047
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,870
或许不是那么奇怪
Well, maybe not so strange.

1048
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,880
明天早上见 非常谢谢  雷诺队长
- I'll see you in the morning. - Thank you, Captain Renault.

1049
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,870
不  是真的吗?
No!

1050
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:17,490
老板  你做了一件天大的好事
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1051
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,690
走开  疯狂的俄国人
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1052
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,500
正如我怀疑 你是不折不扣的感情用事者  为什么?
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist. - Yeah? Why?

1053
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,770
为什么你干扰我小小的罗曼史
Why do you interfere with my little romances?

1054
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,810
就算是向爱情致敬吧
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1055
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,500
这一次我原谅你
Well, I' II forgive you this time.

1056
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,550
不过明天晚上我会带来  一位令窒息的金发美女
But I' II be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond.

1057
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,910
如果她输钱会叫我非常高兴
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

1058
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,190
宾勒先生 不晓得可否跟你谈谈
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you. - Go ahead.

1059
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:55,030
说吧 有别的说话地方吗?
Well, isn't there some other place?

1060
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,620
我要说的是颇机密的事
It's rather confidential, what I have to say.

1061
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,830
在我办公室 好的
- In my office. - Right.

1062
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,560
你一定知道离开卡萨布兰卡 对我很重要
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.

1063
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,730
身为这伟大运动的领导人之一 是一份莫大的荣幸
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement.

1064
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:10,670
你知道我一直从事什么
You know what I' ve been doing.

1065
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,780
你知道那有多重要  对全世界 对千百万人的生命
You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people...

1066
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:17,210
如果我能到美国继续我的工作
...that I reach America and continue my work.

1067
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,820
我对政治不感兴趣
I'm not interested in politics.

1068
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,480
世界的问题不是我分内的事
The problems of the world are not in my department.

1069
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,850
我是开酒馆的
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1070
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:26,790
我从事地下工作的朋友告诉我  你有不平凡的纪录
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record.

1071
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:28,450
你运枪械到衣索比亚
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1072
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:31,560
你在西班牙对抗法西斯 那又怎样?
- You fought against the fascists in Spain. - What of it?

1073
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:34,830
你总是帮受迫害的那边打仗  不是有点奇怪吗?
Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?

1074
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,970
对 我并发现那是种昂贵的喜好
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

1075
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,400
不过我那时候不太会做生意
But then I never was much of a businessman.

1076
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,940
现在你是否较会做生意 晓得...  十万法O这价码
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1077
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:46,240
我欣赏  可是我不接受 我加到二十万
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it. - 200,000.

1078
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:48,870
朋友 你可以加到一百万或三百万
My friend, you could make it a million francs or three.

1079
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,880
我的答案仍然一样
My answer would still be the same.

1080
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,210
一定有原因使你不愿意给我
There must be some reason why you won't let me.

1081
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,540
是有
There is.

1082
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,150
我建议你去问你的妻子
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1083
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,080
你说什么?  我说问你的妻子
- I beg your pardon? - I said, ask your wife.

1084
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,860
我的妻子 对
- My wife? - Yes.

1085
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:08,590
(德国歌)

1086
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:45,260
弹奏"马赛曲"  快
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1087
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:49,520
法国万岁，民主万岁

1088
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:03,380
你明白我的意思了吧 如果在咖啡馆出现的拉斯路
See what I mean? If Laszlo 's presence in a cafe...

1089
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,380
可以鼓动这样不幸的示威行动
...can inspire this demonstration...

1090
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,950
他在卡萨布兰卡 还会导致什么?
...what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?

1091
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,110
我奉劝把这地方马上查封
I advise that this place be shut up at once.

1092
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,990
可是大家都那么开心
- But everybody's having a good time.

1093
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:14,820
对  太开心了 这地方必须查封
- Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.

1094
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,950
可是我没有藉口查封  找一个
- But I have no excuse to close it. - Find one.

1095
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,290
祝健康!先生 健康

1096
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,500
所有人必须马上离开
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1097
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,970
这咖啡馆关闭 直到另行通知为止
This cafe is closed until further notice.

1098
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,800
马上清场
Clear the room at once.

1099
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,610
你怎么可以查封我 有什么理由
How can you close me up?

1100
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:37,270
我很震惊  发现这里进行赌博
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.

1101
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,380
你赢的钱  先生  很谢谢你
- Your winnings, sir. - Thank you.

1102
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,110
所有人马上出去
Everybody out at once.

1103
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,230
经过这次骚动后
After this disturbance...

1104
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:49,230
拉斯路先生留在卡萨布兰卡已不再安全了
...it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1105
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,130
今早你暗示他离开卡萨布兰卡  并不安全
This morning you implied it wasrt safe to leave Casablanca.

1106
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,230
不错  除了一处目的地 回到被占领的法国
That is also true, except for one destination: Occupied France.

1107
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:56,640
被占领的法国?
- Occupied France? - Under safe conduct from me.

1108
01:14:56,740 --> 01:14:59,640
在我的安全保证下 一文不值
Of what value is that?

1109
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,760
你可能记得过去德国的信誉 值多少钱吧!
You may recall what German guarantees have been won'th in the past.

1110
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,210
你只有两个选择 是什么?
- There are two other alternatives for him. - What are they?

1111
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,680
有可能法国当局会找一个理由
The French authorities may find a reason...

1112
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,680
把他送进这儿的集中营
...to put him in the concentration camp here.

1113
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,940
另一个选择呢?
The other alternative?

1114
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,880
亲爱的小姐  或许你已经察觉
My dear, perhaps you have already observed...

1115
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,880
在卡萨布兰卡人命不值钱
...that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1116
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,390
晚安  小姐
Good night, mademoiselle.

1117
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,590
瑞克怎么回事?  我们待会儿再商量
- What happened with Rick? - We'll discuss it later.

1118
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,520
我们忠心的朋友仍然在那里
Our faithful friend is still there.

1119
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,590
维多 求你今晚不要去地下会议
Please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.

1120
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,920
我一定要去
I must.

1121
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:05,560
况且一个男人能在他妻子面前 扮演英雄的机会不多
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife.

1122
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,610
不要开玩笑 经过史查沙少校今晚的警告后
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I' m frightened.

1123
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:11,180
我很害怕 告诉你事实  我也害怕
Tell you the truth, I'm frightened too.

1124
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,710
我应该留在这里?  躲在饭店房间
Shall I remain here in a hotel room, hiding?

1125
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:15,540
或者我应该继续尽力而为?
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1126
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:18,610
不管我说什么你也会继续做
Whatever I' d say, you would carry on.

1127
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,490
维多 为何你不告诉我瑞克的事 你发现了什么?
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?

1128
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:24,360
很明显那些信在他手上
- Apparently he has the letters. - Yes?

1129
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:26,820
还有呢?  可是没有要卖的意思
But no intention of selling them.

1130
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:30,560
一般人会以为情感不能打动他 钱应该可以
You'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1131
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,290
他有没有跟你说理由是什么?
Did he give any reason?

1132
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,830
他建议我问你  问我?
- He suggested I ask you. - Ask me?

1133
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:39,000
对  他说: 问你的妻子
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1134
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,870
我不知道他为什么那样说
I don't know why he said that.

1135
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,150
我们外头那位朋友 现在应该以为我们休息了
Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now.

1136
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,350
我待会儿就去
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1137
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:03,920
伊莎  我... 什么?
- Ilsa, I... - Yes?

1138
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,460
我在集中营的时候
When I was in the concentration camp...

1139
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,560
你在巴黎寂寞吗?
...were you lonely in Paris?

1140
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,030
对  维多  我是寂寞
Yes, Victor, I was.

1141
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,980
我知道寂寞是什么样子
I know how it is to be lonely.

1142
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,380
有什么事你想要告诉我的吗?
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1143
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,370
没有  维多
No, Victor, there isn't.

1144
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,550
我非常爱你  亲爱的
Ilove you very much, my dear.

1145
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,890
是  是  我知道
Yes, I know.

1146
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,160
维多  不管我做什么 你会不会相信我...
Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?

1147
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,030
你甚至不必说出来
You don't even have to say it.

1148
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,970
我也相信你
I'll believe.

1149
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,400
晚安  亲爱的
Good night, dear.

1150
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,740
晚安
Good night.

1151
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,450
维多 什么事?  亲爱的
- Victor. - Yes, dear?

1152
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,120
要小心
Be careful.

1153
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,290
当然  我会小心
Of course I' II be careful.

1154
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,840
你的情况非常好  瑞克先生
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1155
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:00,680
我可以支持多久不营业
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1156
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,880
两星期或者三星期
Two weeks, maybe three.

1157
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,210
或者我不必关门 以前用贿赂有效
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before.

1158
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,650
目前所有人依旧发薪水
In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.

1159
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,180
谢谢  瑞克先生
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1160
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,720
沙克听到一定很高兴 我欠他钱
Sascha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.

1161
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,160
你把门锁好  可以吗?  卡尔
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl - I will.

1162
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,500
我会的 然后我要去开会... 别告诉我你去那里
- Then I am going to the meeting... - Don't tell me where you're going.

1163
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,790
我不会
I won't.

1164
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,030
晚安
Good night.

1165
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,760
晚安  瑞克先生
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1166
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,820
你怎么进来的?  街外的楼梯
- How did you get in? - The stairs from the street.

1167
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,320
今天早上我跟你说有空来坐
I told you this morning you'd come around,

1168
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,320
不过这似乎比预定的稍早了点
but this is ahead of schedule.

1169
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,720
你不坐下来吗?
Well, won't you sit down?

1170
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:53,730
理查  我必须见你 再度叫理查  我们回到巴黎了
- Richard, I had to see you. - "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1171
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:54,820
求求你
Please.

1172
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,300
你的突然来访是否有可能 跟那些过境信有关呢?
Your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?

1173
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,200
似乎只要信一天还在我手上  我就不愁寂寞了
Seems as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

1174
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:04,000
你要多少钱都可以  不过你一定要把那些信给我
Ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters.

1175
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,740
我已经跟你的丈夫讲清楚了  绝不交易
I went all through that with your husband. It 's no deal.

1176
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,040
我知道你对我的感受 可是我得要求你为更重要的事
I know how you feel about me...

1177
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:12,140
先将自己的感受抛在一边
...but put your feelings aside for something more important.

1178
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:14,620
我又要再听一次 你丈夫有多伟大
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is...

1179
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,780
他为多么重要的目标战斗吗?
...what an important cause he's fighting for?

1180
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,290
那也是你的目标
It was your cause too.

1181
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,960
以你自己的方式 你也为相同的目标战斗
In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

1182
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:24,090
我不再为任何事战斗了 除了为自己
I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself.

1183
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:26,320
我唯一感兴趣的目标是自己
I'm the only cause I' m interested in.

1184
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,510
理查  我们曾经相爱过 如果那些日子对你有意义
We loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you...

1185
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:39,540
如果我是你就不会提起巴黎 那是差劲的推销把戏
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

1186
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,310
求求你听我说 如果你知道事实是怎么回事
Listen to me. If you knew what really happened,

1187
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:45,410
如果你知道事情的真相 不管你说什么我也不会相信
if you only knew the truth. I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said.

1188
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,610
为了达到目的 你现在什么也说得出口
You'd say anything now to get what you want.

1189
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,590
你很遗撼  是吗?
You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?

1190
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,520
那么多事危在旦夕 你想到的只有自己的感觉
With so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings.

1191
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,700
一个女人伤害了你 你便对全世界报复
One woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1192
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,960
你是...个胆小鬼  弱者...
You're a coward and a weakling.

1193
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:12,240
不  不  理查  对不起
No. Oh, Richard. I' m sorry.

1194
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:16,280
对不起  可是... 可是你是我们最后的希望
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1195
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:19,140
如果你不帮我们 维多拉斯路会死在卡萨布兰卡
If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1196
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,370
那又怎样?
What of it?

1197
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:23,210
我也会死在卡萨布兰卡 这是死亡的好地方
I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

1198
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,890
现在  如果你...
Now, if you'll...

1199
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,560
好吧
All right.

1200
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,760
我尝试跟你讲道理
I tried to reason with you.

1201
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:40,170
我什么法子也试了 现在我要那些信
I tried everything. Now, I want those letters.

1202
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:44,310
去拿给我  我不必去拿  就在这里
- Get them for me. - I don't have to. I got them right here.

1203
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,140
放在桌上
Put them on the table.

1204
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,040
不
No.

1205
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,240
最后一次  放在桌上
For the last time, put them on the table.

1206
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:58,950
如果拉斯路和他的目标对你那么重要 什么也挡不住你
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything.

1207
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,950
好吧  我让你更方便一点
All right, I'll make it easier for you.

1208
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,090
开枪吧  你将会帮了我一个忙
Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.

1209
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,900
理查
Richard...

1210
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,440
我尽量避开你
...I tried to stay away.

1211
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,470
我以为我永远不会再见到你
I thought I would never see you again.

1212
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:24,080
你已经在我生命中消失
That you were out of my life.

1213
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,360
你离开巴黎的那天
The day you left Paris...

1214
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,930
如果你知道我的感受
...if you knew what I went through.

1215
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,270
如果你知道我多爱你
If you knew how much I loved you.

1216
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,110
我仍然有多么爱你
How much I still love you.

1217
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,020
然后呢?
And then?

1218
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:19,400
我们结婚后不久维多回到捷克
It wasrt long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1219
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:23,100
他们需要他在布拉格 可是秘密警察在等着他
They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1220
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:25,000
只看到报上的两行小启
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1221
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,800
维多拉斯路被逮捕送往集中营
"Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."

1222
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,310
我发狂一般 好几个月我努力打听消息
I was frantic. For months I tried to get word.

1223
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:32,810
消息终于来了
Then it came.

1224
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,180
他死了 逃走的时候被枪打死
He was dead. Shot trying to escape.

1225
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:38,980
我好寂寞  我一无所有 连希望也没有
I was lonely. I had nothing, not even hope.

1226
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,820
后来我遇上你
Then I met you.

1227
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,490
为什么你不对我诚实说?  为什么你守着结婚的秘密?
Why werert you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1228
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,870
那不是我的秘密  理查 是维多要那样
It wasrt my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way.

1229
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,490
甚至我们最要好的朋友 也不知道我们的婚事
Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage.

1230
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:53,810
那是他保护我的方法  关于他的工作我知道太多了
That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work.

1231
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,910
如果秘密警察发现我是他妻子
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me...

1232
01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:00,650
那会为我和地下工作者 带来危险
...and for those working with us.

1233
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:03,080
你什么时候发现他仍然活着?
And when did you first find out he was alive?

1234
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,640
刚好我们准备一起离开巴黎前
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together.

1235
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:09,250
一个朋友前来告诉我维多活着
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive.

1236
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:12,550
他们把他藏在巴黎市郊的 一节货运车厢上
They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris.

1237
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:14,880
他生病需要我
He was sick. He needed me.

1238
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,090
我想告诉你可是我不敢
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.

1239
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:21,600
我知道  你一定不会离开巴黎  秘密警察便会捉到你
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1240
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:26,000
所以我...
Well...

1241
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:28,000
其余的你已知道了
...well, you know the rest.

1242
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:34,040
仍然是一个没有结局的故事
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1243
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,340
那现在呢?
What about now?

1244
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,570
现在?
Now?

1245
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,910
我不知道
I don't know.

1246
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:43,610
我知道我再没有勇气离开你
I know that I' II never have the strength to leave you again.

1247
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,880
那拉斯路呢?
And Laszlo?

1248
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,390
你会帮助他的 理查  对不对?  你设法使他离境
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out.

1249
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:53,060
他便能拥有他的工作 他生存的所有意义
Then he'll have his work. All that he's been living for.

1250
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,650
除了一样
All except one.

1251
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,570
他将没有你
He won't have you.

1252
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,470
我无法再挣扎下去
I can't fight it anymore.

1253
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,570
我曾舍你而去 第二次我做不到
I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.

1254
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:11,610
我再也不知道 什么是对什么是错
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

1255
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:13,840
你必须为我们两个想
You have to think for both of us.

1256
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,250
为我们所有人想
For all of us.

1257
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,520
好吧  我会的
All right. I will.

1258
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,360
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1259
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:33,260
我希望我没有那么爱你
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1260
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:46,920
我想我们甩掉他们了
- I think we lost them. - Yes.

1261
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:51,720
对  我恐怕他们抓到其他的人 进里面去
- I' m afraid they caught some of the others. - Come inside.

1262
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:00,230
来  拉斯路先生 我会立刻帮你
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.

1263
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:02,230
谢谢
Thank you.

1264
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,850
卡尔  怎么回事?
Carl, what happened?

1265
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:25,760
警察查获我们的会议 瑞克先生 我们刚好来得及逃走
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick. We escaped at the last moment.

1266
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,160
上来一下 好  我来
- Come up here a minute. - Yes, I come.

1267
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:31,730
我要你把后门关掉 可能会引起警察的注意
Turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.

1268
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:35,130
沙克每天都会关的 今晚他忘记了
- But Sascha always puts out that light. - Tonight he forgot.

1269
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,460
好  我来了  我会去关
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1270
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:48,640
我要你送林小姐回家 好的
- I want you to take Miss Lund home. - Yes, sir.

1271
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:02,750
没什么  只是小小的割伤 我们被迫从窗户爬出来
It's nothing, just a little cut. We had to get through a window.

1272
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,690
这可能有帮助
This might come in handy.

1273
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:05,990
谢谢
Thank you.

1274
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:08,820
千钧一发?  对  挺危险
- Had a close one, eh? - Yes, rather.

1275
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:13,600
你有时候会不会想这值得吗?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's won'th all this?

1276
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,710
我是指你战斗的目标
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1277
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:18,800
我不如问为什么我们要呼吸
We might as well question why we breathe.

1278
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,530
如果我们不呼吸  我们就会死
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1279
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,150
如果我们停止对抗敌人 世界就会死
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

1280
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,580
又怎样?  苦难就结束了
What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.

1281
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,910
你知道你的口气像什么吗?
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1282
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,250
像一个拿内心不相信的事情
Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something...

1283
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,250
来说服自己的人
...he doesn't believe in his heart.

1284
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:36,460
我们每一个人都有一个目标 善意的  或邪恶的
Each of us has a destiny. For good, or for evil.

1285
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,090
我明白了 我怀疑你是否真明白
- I get the point. - I wonder if you do.

1286
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:42,520
我怀疑你知不知道 你在逃避自己
I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself...

1287
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:44,290
你将永远不会成功
...and that you'll never succeed.

1288
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:46,700
你似乎对我的目标t如指掌
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1289
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,100
我知道关于你的事 比你怀疑的多
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect.

1290
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,670
例如我知道你爱上一个女人
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1291
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,640
或者这是一种奇怪的现象
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1292
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,710
我们两个会爱着同一个女人
...that we both should be in love with the same woman.

1293
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,040
我走进这咖啡馆的第一个晚上
The first evening I came into this cafe...

1294
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,590
我知道 你和伊莎之间有些不寻常
...I knew there was something between you and llsa.

1295
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,050
既然不能责怪任何人
Since no one is to blame...

1296
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,480
我不要求解释 我只要求一件事
...I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing.

1297
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:13,770
你不愿给我过境信函  没关系
You won't give me the letters of transit. All right.

1298
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,800
不过我要我的妻子安全
But I want my wife to be safe.

1299
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,500
我请求你帮忙
I ask you as a favor...

1300
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:20,600
用那些信带她离开卡萨布兰卡
...to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

1301
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:21,860
你那么爱她吗?
You love her that much?

1302
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:24,840
或者你只把我想成 一个主义的领导者
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause.

1303
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,000
我也是个人
Well, I am also a human being.

1304
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:30,340
对  我是那么爱她
Yes, I love her that much.

1305
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,450
拉斯路先生 什么事?
- Monsieur Laszlo? - Yes?

1306
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:42,150
你跟我们走 我们有你的逮捕令
You'll come with us. We have a warrant for your arrest.

1307
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,320
什么罪名?
On what charge?

1308
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,690
雷诺队长稍后会跟你讨论
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later.

1309
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,590
似乎命运正在插手
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1310
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,620
你没有实在的证据  你也知道
You haven't any proof, and you know it.

1311
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,620
这里是未被占领的法国  不是德国
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1312
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,980
你能做的只是罚他几千法O 或者拘禁30天
All you can do is fine him and give him 30 days.

1313
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,880
不如现在放他
You might as well let him go now.

1314
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:11,980
瑞克  我奉劝你不要对 拉斯路发生的事太感兴趣
I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo.

1315
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:13,620
如果你企图帮他逃走
If you were to help him escape...

1316
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:16,230
你为什么认为 我会为拉斯路冒险
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1317
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,860
第一  你赌十万法O他能逃掉
Because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1318
01:29:19,030 --> 01:29:20,600
第二  你有那些过境信  不必否认了
Two, you've got the letters of transit. Don't bother to deny it.

1319
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,530
你可能会那样做 只为了你不喜欢史查沙的长相
And you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1320
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,440
事实上  我也不喜欢
As a matter of fact, I don't either.

1321
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:29,000
极佳的理由
They're all excellent reasons.

1322
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:31,110
别太依赖我的友谊  瑞克
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1323
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,980
在这件事上  我无能为力 况且我可能输十万法O
In this matter I' m powerless. Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1324
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,640
你不算很奸滑  不过很有效 我明白你的意思
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I get the point.

1325
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,310
对  我有那些信
Yes, I have the letters.

1326
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,320
但是我打算自己用
But I intend using them myself.

1327
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:47,250
我要搭今晚最后的班机 离开卡萨布兰卡
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1328
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:50,490
我要带一位朋友一道走 一位你会赞赏的朋友
And I' m taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

1329
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:52,630
什么朋友?  伊莎林
- What friend? - Ilsa Lund.

1330
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,390
可以打消你认为 我会帮忙拉斯路逃走的想法吧
That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.

1331
01:29:56,570 --> 01:29:58,590
我最不愿意在美国看到的人
The last man I want to see in America.

1332
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,140
你来这里不是为了告诉我这些 你有过境信
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit.

1333
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:05,370
你可以填上你和她的名字 爱什么时候走都可以
You can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please.

1334
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,170
为什么你仍然对 拉斯路的境遇感兴趣
Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo?

1335
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:12,580
我没有  不过我对伊莎和我 以后的境遇感兴趣
I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to llsa and me.

1336
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:14,790
我们有合法权利离开是不是
We have a legal right to go, that's true...

1337
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:18,480
不过即使有合法的权利 曾经也有人被留在卡萨布兰卡
...but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.

1338
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:22,190
为什么你认为我们会留置你 伊莎是拉斯路的妻子
- What makes you think we want to hold you? - Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife.

1339
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:24,890
她大概知道一些 史查沙想知道的事
She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.

1340
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,590
路易  我跟你来一项协议
Louis, I' II make a deal with you.

1341
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,290
不用这项你加给他的小罪名 而找些真正的大罪名
Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big...

1342
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:33,730
可叫他待在集中营好几年的
...something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years...

1343
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,500
可是大功一件  对不?  不错
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - Certainly.

1344
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,840
德国和维琪政府会很感激
Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

1345
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,070
那就释放他
Then release him.

1346
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,870
飞机起飞前半小时你到我的店
You be at my place a half -hour before the plane leaves.

1347
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,570
我安排拉斯路来拿过境信
I'll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters...

1348
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,380
那便给你犯罪的证据以逮捕他
...and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest.

1349
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:50,950
你逮到他  而我们逃掉了
You get him, and we get away.

1350
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,020
对德国人来说 后者只会带来轻度的苦恼
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1351
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:57,020
这交易我还有些地方不太明白
There's still something about this I don't quite understand.

1352
01:30:57,230 --> 01:30:59,920
林小姐  她非常美丽  不错
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1353
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,430
可是你从不对任何女人感兴趣
...but you were never interested in any woman.

1354
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,230
她不只是任何女人 我明白了
- She isn't just any woman. - I see.

1355
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,240
我怎么知道你会守信
How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

1356
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:11,270
我马上在探访室 跟拉斯路安排好
I'll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1357
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,080
瑞克  我将会怀念你
I'm gonna miss you.

1358
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:16,080
很明显你是在卡萨布兰卡 唯一比我更无顾忌的人
You're the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1359
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:17,440
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

1360
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,170
去吧  瑞克
Go ahead, Ricky.

1361
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,820
你放他走后调走你的看门狗
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.

1362
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:23,820
我不要他今天下午在附近
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1363
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,250
我不能冒险  路易  即使跟你
I'm taking no chances, Louis, not even with you.

1364
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:36,420
我们要不要签一份文件 还是握手就够了
Should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?

1365
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,870
当然是不够  不过我很忙 只好这样了
Certainly not good enough. But since I' m in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1366
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:43,610
离开卡萨布兰卡去美国 你是幸运的人
To get out of Casablanca and go to America... You're a lucky man.

1367
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:47,170
我跟山姆的协定一直是 他得到利润的百分之二十五
My agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits.

1368
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,170
那仍然维持
That still goes.

1369
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:52,080
我凑巧知道是百分之十 不过他值百分之二十五
I happen to know he gets 10 percent. But he's won'th 25.

1370
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,220
阿都  卡尔和沙克要留在店里 不然我不卖
Abdul, Carl and Sascha, they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1371
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,850
当然 没有他们就不是瑞克咖啡馆
Of course. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1372
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,350
再会
Well, so long.

1373
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,550
别忘了 你欠咖啡馆一百箱美国烟
Don't forget you owe Rick's 100 can'tons of American cigarettes.

1374
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:05,220
我会记得付给自己
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1375
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:17,440
“关闭，警察首长命令”

1376
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,000
你迟到了  我接到通知拉斯路刚离开饭店
- You're late. - I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1377
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,470
我会来得及的
...so I knew I' d be on time.

1378
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:46,170
我想我说过 把你的看门狗绑起来
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.

1379
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:47,670
不会有人跟踪他来这里
- He won't be followed here.

1380
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,870
你知道没有你 这地方会完全不一样
This place will never be the same without you.

1381
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,210
我知道你的意思 可是我已经跟法拉利说好
I know what you mean. But I' ve spoken to Ferrari.

1382
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,610
你在轮盘上仍然可以赢
You'll still win at roulette.

1383
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:56,510
一切都准备好了吗?  信就在这
- Is everything ready? - I have the letters right here.

1384
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,880
告诉我 我们搜查时藏在那里?
When we searched the place, where were they?

1385
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:00,210
山姆的钢琴
Sam's piano.

1386
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,890
我活该  没有音乐细胞
Serves me right for not being musical.

1387
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,180
他们来了
Here they are.

1388
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:06,420
你最好到我办公室等
You better wait in my office.

1389
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,060
拿去

1390
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:18,170
理查  维多以为我跟他一起走  你没有告诉他吗?
Victor thinks I' m leaving with him. Havert you told him?

1391
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:20,640
不  还没有 可是没有关系对不对?
- Not yet. - But you were able to arrange everything?

1392
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,870
你已经安排好一切 一切都很好
Everything is quite all right.

1393
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,040
我们在机场告诉他  越少时间去想  对大家越好过
We'll tell him at the airport. The less time to think, the easier.

1394
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:28,070
请相信我
Please trust me.

1395
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,340
是  我会
Yes, I will.

1396
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:38,650
宾勒先生 我不知道如何感谢你
- I don't know how to thank you.

1397
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:40,650
省省吧  我们还有很多事要做
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1398
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:45,550
我把钱带走了  宾勒先生 留着吧  在美国你会需要的
- I brought the money. - Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1399
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,860
可是我们协定过 别管它
- But we made a deal. - Never mind that.

1400
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,400
你在里斯本不会有麻烦吧?  不会  一切都安排好了
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon? - No. It 's all arranged.

1401
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,830
很好  信就在这里  从没用过
Good. I' ve got the letters here, made out in blank.

1402
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,440
你只要补上签名就好了
All you have to do is fill in the signatures.

1403
01:33:56,610 --> 01:33:58,010
维多拉斯路
Victor Laszlo.

1404
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:01,270
维多拉斯路  你被捕了
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1405
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,870
罪名是  快递员谋杀案的帮凶
The charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from...

1406
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,870
这些信是从他们身上偷的
...whom the letters were stolen.

1407
01:34:08,490 --> 01:34:10,420
对 你对我的朋友瑞克感到意外  理由很简单
You're surprised about my friend Ricky? The explanation is simple.

1408
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:15,320
爱情似乎战胜德行  谢谢...
Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1409
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:20,130
且慢  路易  不会有人被捕 起码不是现在
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1410
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,300
你是不是疯了?
- Have you lost your mind? - I have. Sit down.

1411
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,470
我是  到那边坐下 把枪放下  路易  我不想开枪打你
- Put that gun down. - I don't want to shoot you...

1412
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:27,300
但如果你再踏一步我会的
...but I will if you take one more step.

1413
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,570
在这情况下  我会坐下
Under the circumstances, I will sit down.

1414
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:34,410
把手放在桌上 我猜你知道你在做什么
- Keep your hands on the table.

1415
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:36,410
不过我怀疑你知否这代表什么
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1416
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,610
我知道 待会儿我们有很多时间讨论
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1417
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,370
调走你的看门狗  你说的
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1418
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,920
同样的  你打电话到机场  让我听到你告诉他们
Just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them.

1419
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:45,890
记得这把枪正对着你的心脏
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1420
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,020
那是我最不脆弱的地方
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1421
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,630
哈罗  是机场吗?
Hello? Is that the airport?

1422
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:00,600
我是雷诺队长
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1423
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,360
有两份过境信要用来搭乘 往里斯本的班机
There'll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane.

1424
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,340
绝不能阻止他们
There's to be no trouble about them.

1425
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,770
好
Good.

1426
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:08,370
哈罗?  哈罗?
Hello?

1427
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,880
我的车  快点 是  少校
My car, quickly!

1428
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,650
我是史查沙少校
This is Major Strasser.

1429
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,290
马上派一队警员 到机场跟我会合
Have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once.

1430
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,750
马上  你听到吗?
At once, do you hear?

1431
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,920
喂  控制塔  听得到吗?
Hello, radio tower?

1432
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:34,470
往里斯本的班机十分钟后起飞 东跑道
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.

1433
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:36,940
能见度一又二分之一哩
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1434
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:41,040
地面薄雾的深度大约五百
Light ground fog. Depth of fog approximately 500.

1435
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,940
上升高度不受限制  谢谢
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1436
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,190
路易  叫你的手下 随拉斯路先生去安置好行李
Have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage.

1437
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,130
当然  瑞克  一切依你
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1438
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:03,500
拿拉斯路的行李放在飞机上
- Find Laszlo 's luggage. Put it on the plane. - Yes, sir.

1439
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,190
是  长官 请走这边
This way, please.

1440
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:10,900
如果你不介意  你填上名字 那会更正式一点
If you don't mind, fill in the names. That'll make it more official.

1441
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,100
你什么都设想周到  对不对?
You think of everything, don't you?

1442
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,710
名字是维多拉斯路先生太太
And the names are Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1443
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:19,550
可是  为什么是我的名字 理查 因为你要上那架飞机
- But why my name, Richard? - Because you're getting on that plane.

1444
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,240
我不明白  那你呢?
I don't understand. What about you?

1445
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,510
我留在这里看着他 等飞机安全离开为止
I'm staying with him till the plane gets away.

1446
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:25,680
不  理查  你怎么回事?  昨晚
No. What has happened? Last night you said...

1447
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,650
昨晚我们说了很多
Last night we said a great many things.

1448
01:36:27,830 --> 01:36:29,730
你说我要为我俩考虑
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1449
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:32,560
自那时候起我想了很多 想来想去只有一个结论
I've done a lot of it since then. It adds up to one thing:

1450
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:35,530
你跟维多一起上那架飞机 你是属于他的
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.

1451
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,400
你非听我说不可
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1452
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:40,470
知不知道如果你留在这里 会有什么后果
Any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?

1453
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:44,010
十分之九的机会 我们两个将被关在集中营 对不对?
Chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1454
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:46,470
我恐怕史查沙少校会坚持要
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1455
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:50,110
你这样说只是为了叫我走 我这样说是因为那是事实
- You're saying this only to make me go. - I' m saying it because it's true.

1456
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,410
我们的心里都明白你属于维多
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.

1457
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,950
你是他工作的一部分 他的精神鼓励
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.

1458
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,990
如果飞机离地  你不在上面 你会后悔的
If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1459
01:36:58,190 --> 01:37:00,590
或者不是今天 或者不是明天  不过很快
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1460
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:04,750
并且是后悔一辈子 那我们呢?
But what about us?

1461
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:06,230
我们永远拥有巴黎
We'll always have Paris.

1462
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,700
本来没有 你来卡萨布兰卡后我们失去了
We didn't have... We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.

1463
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,460
不过昨晚我们重拾回来
We got it back last night.

1464
01:37:12,370 --> 01:37:15,240
昨晚我说我永远不离开你  你永远不会
- When I said I would never leave you. - And you never will.

1465
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,240
我也有工作要做
But I' ve got a job to do too.

1466
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:22,070
我要去的地方你不能跟来 我要做的事你无法参与
Where I' m going, you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1467
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,200
伊莎  清高我并不在行
Ilsa, I' m no good at being noble.

1468
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,580
不过要明白也不难
But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people...

1469
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,790
在这疯狂的世界 三个小人物就别太计较了
...don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

1470
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:33,410
总有一天你会明白的
Someday you'll understand that.

1471
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:36,350
而现在...
Now, now.

1472
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,290
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1473
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,940
一切都就绪  除了一件事
- Everything is in order. - All except one thing.

1474
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,310
在你离开前有些事你应该知道
There's something you should know.

1475
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:02,350
宾勒先生 你不要求你解释什么
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1476
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,610
我打算要 因为往后可能会影响到你
I'm going to anyway. It may make a difference to you later on.

1477
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:07,650
你说你知道伊莎和我的事 对
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1478
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,690
你不知道昨晚你进来时 她正在我的店里
You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were.

1479
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:14,300
她来是为了过境信  对不?  伊莎
She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, llsa?

1480
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,960
对
Yes.

1481
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:18,160
可是都没有效
She tried everything to get them. Nothing worked.

1482
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:21,860
她尽全力让我相信她仍爱着我
She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me.

1483
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,560
那在很久以前就结束了
But that was all over long ago.

1484
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:26,910
为了你的缘故  她假装不是  我让她继续假装下去
For your sake, she pretended it wasrt, and I let her pretend.

1485
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:30,210
我明白
I understand.

1486
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:32,510
拿去 谢谢
- Here it is. - Thanks.

1487
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:35,010
我很感激
I appreciate it.

1488
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,650
欢迎你回到战线上
Welcome back to the fight.

1489
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:40,380
这一次我知道我们这边会赢
This time I know our side will win.

1490
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,270
你准备好了吗?  伊莎
Are you ready, llsa?

1491
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,510
对  我准备好了
Yes, I' m ready.

1492
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:04,010
再见  瑞克
Goodbye, Rick.

1493
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,780
上帝祝福你
God bless you.

1494
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,810
最好赶快不然你会搭不上飞机
You better hurry. You'll miss that plane.

1495
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:30,810
我是对的 你是个感情用事的人
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

1496
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:33,810
留在原地 我不知你在说什么?
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.

1497
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:35,310
你刚才为拉斯路做的事
What you just did for Laszlo.

1498
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,880
你为了叫伊莎跟他走 编的童话故事
That fairy tale you invented to send llsa away with him.

1499
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:39,680
我对女人略知一二  朋友
I know a little about women, my friend. She went.

1500
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:42,690
她走了  不过她知道你说谎
But she knew you were lying.

1501
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:44,720
不管如何感谢你帮我忙
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1502
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:49,190
我假定你知道我们都将不好过 特别是你
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us.

1503
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:53,430
当然我必须逮捕你 飞机一走马上可以  路易
- I' II have to arrest you, of course. - As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1504
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:04,770
那通电话是什么意思?  维多拉斯路在那架飞机上
- What was the meaning of that phone call? - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1505
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:08,900
你为何站在这?  你为何不阻止他
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?

1506
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,100
问瑞克先生
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1507
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:16,250
离开那电话 我劝你不要干涉
- Get away from that phone. - I advise you not to interfere.

1508
01:40:16,450 --> 01:40:19,720
我愿意开枪打雷诺队长 也会愿意打你
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I' m willing to shoot you.

1509
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:23,250
哈罗 把电话放下
- Hello! - Put that phone down.

1510
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:25,290
替我接控制塔 放下!
- Get me the radio tower. - Put it down!

1511
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:41,900
史查沙少校被射杀
Major Strasser has been shot.

1512
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,310
围捕可疑的嫌犯 是  队长
Round up the usual suspects.

1513
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:09,400
(维琪矿泉水)

1514
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,710
瑞克  你不只是感情用事 你已变成爱国份子了
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.

1515
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,040
似乎现在是开始的好时机
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.

1516
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,450
我想你是对的
I think perhaps you're right.

1517
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:49,940
你在卡萨布兰卡消失一段时间 可能是个好主意
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1518
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:52,550
在巴撒市那边有自由法国驻军
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.

1519
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,890
我可以帮你安排通行  我的过境信
- I could be induced to arrange a passage. - My letter of transit?

1520
01:41:54,990 --> 01:41:58,090
我大可去旅行
I could use a trip.

1521
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:01,450
那不影响我们的赌注 你仍然欠我十万法O
But it doesn't change our bet. You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1522
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:04,590
那十万法O应该够我们的开销
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.

1523
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:05,990
我们的开销?
"Our" expenses?

1524
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:11,030
路易 我想这是美好友谊的开始
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

1525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
