00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,216
With the coming
of the Second World War...

5
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:17,547
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

6
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:20,554
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

7
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,423
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

8
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:26,794
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

9
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:30,898
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

10
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,566
Paris to Marseilles...

11
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,242
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

12
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,050
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

13
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,730
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

14
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:01,525
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

15
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,202
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

16
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,803
And from Lisbon to the New World.

17
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,206
But the others wait in Casablanca.

18
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,337
And wait and wait...

19
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,347
...and wait.

20
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:28,586
To all officers:

21
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:33,632
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

22
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:36,827
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

23
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:40,838
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

24
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,606
Important.

25
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,774
May we see your papers?

26
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,771
I don't think I have them on me.

27
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,278
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It 's possible that I...

28
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:23,542
Yes. Here they are.

29
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,622
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

30
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,451
Halt!

31
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,717
Halt!

32
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,350
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

33
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:04,023
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

34
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,989
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

35
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:10,823
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

36
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:13,500
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

37
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:17,330
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

38
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:25,968
Along with these unappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

39
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,546
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

40
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:32,014
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

41
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,210
This place is full of vultures.

42
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:37,118
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

43
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,759
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

44
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,794
What an amusing little fellow.

45
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,295
Waiter.

46
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,699
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

47
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,235
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

48
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,056
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

49
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,475
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

50
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:39,846
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:44,317
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

52
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,517
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

53
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,692
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

54
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:51,524
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

55
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,167
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

56
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:55,529
That is kind of you.

57
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:04,842
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

58
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:08,675
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

59
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,951
- Perhaps you werert referring to weather.
- What else?

60
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,383
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

61
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:18,355
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

62
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:21,552
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

63
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:24,697
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

64
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:28,323
I've already heard about this cafe.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

65
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,117
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

66
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,295
I'll never get out of here.

67
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,562
I'll die in Casablanca.

68
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,995
But can't you make it just a little more?

69
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,134
Please?

70
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:37,769
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

71
00:07:37,972 --> 00:07:40,202
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

72
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,533
All right.

73
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:44,677
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

74
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,607
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

75
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:55,188
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

76
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,654
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

77
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:01,123
Remember, in cash.

78
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:08,994
Cheerio.

79
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:12,702
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

80
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,445
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

81
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,313
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

82
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,987
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

83
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:33,020
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

84
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:37,061
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

85
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:39,892
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

86
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,628
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

87
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,306
We have something
to look forward to.

88
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,836
And his father is the bellboy.

89
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,040
Excuse me.

90
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,672
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

91
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,438
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...?
I know there is gambling in there.

92
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,778
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

93
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:35,979
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

94
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,217
And if you think I' m going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

95
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:42,361
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

96
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,829
Your cash is good at the bar.

97
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:48,998
What? Do you know who I am?

98
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:51,171
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

99
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,341
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

100
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:01,671
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

101
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:04,682
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

102
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:08,821
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

103
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,520
What right do I have to think?

104
00:10:16,597 --> 00:10:17,825
May I

105
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,526
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasrt it?

106
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:24,364
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

107
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:26,802
...today they are the honored dead.

108
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:30,844
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

109
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,170
I forgive you.

110
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:34,040
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

111
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:37,217
I forgot, you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

112
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:39,881
You despise me, don't you?

113
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,245
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

114
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:43,753
But why?

115
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,855
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

116
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:52,021
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

117
00:10:52,232 --> 00:10:56,794
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

118
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:59,234
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

119
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:03,800
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault 's price.

120
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,412
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

121
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:11,176
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

122
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:14,752
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

123
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,618
And I' m leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

124
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,851
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

125
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,528
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

126
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,056
Look, Rick.

127
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,401
Know what this is?

128
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:31,702
Something that even you have never seen.

129
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:35,033
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

130
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:38,540
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

131
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:39,679
One moment.

132
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:43,178
Tonight I' II be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

133
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,183
And then, addio, Casablanca.

134
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:50,683
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

135
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,325
...you are the only one I trust.

136
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,389
Will you keep these for me, please?

137
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,359
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

138
00:11:57,531 --> 00:12:00,295
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

139
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,059
Please keep them for me.

140
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,430
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

141
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,940
Waiter. I' II be expecting some people.

142
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:10,008
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

143
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,212
Rick...

144
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,539
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

145
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:19,148
If you'll forgive me, I' II share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

146
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,411
Just a moment.

147
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:26,620
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

148
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:32,895
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

149
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,036
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

150
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,918
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

151
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,714
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

152
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,380
- Fine, but I' d like to buy your cafe.
- It 's not for sale.

153
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,822
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It 's not for sale at any price.

154
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:11,556
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

155
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:13,892
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

156
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:18,162
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

157
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,738
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

158
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,010
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

159
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,270
Suppose we do.

160
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:30,382
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

161
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:33,346
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

162
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,612
Oh, I like it fine here.

163
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:38,689
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

164
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,153
Sorry.

165
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,328
The boss's private stock...

166
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,934
...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

167
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:53,095
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

168
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:00,473
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

169
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,981
Where were you last night?

170
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:09,418
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

171
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:13,089
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

172
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:15,622
Give me another.

173
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:18,560
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

174
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:20,927
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

175
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,602
- Rick, I' m tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

176
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:26,204
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

177
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,933
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

178
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:33,379
Hey, taxi.

179
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,241
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

180
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,179
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

181
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,377
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

182
00:15:40,554 --> 00:15:41,521
And come right back.

183
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:43,222
Yes, boss.

184
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,662
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

185
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,134
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

186
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,034
Someday they may be scarce.

187
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,475
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

188
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,269
Maybe get her on the rebound.

189
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:07,572
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

190
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,827
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

191
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:26,859
The plane to Lisbon.

192
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:33,335
You would like to be on it?

193
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,201
Why? What's in Lisbon?

194
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,442
The clipper to America.

195
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:40,340
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

196
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:44,483
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

197
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,547
Llike to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

198
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,415
It's a combination of all three.

199
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,057
And what in heavers name
brought you to Casablanca?

200
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,693
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

201
00:16:54,995 --> 00:16:58,158
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

202
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:00,563
I was misinformed.

203
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,501
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

204
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:07,504
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

205
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:10,069
...and the cashier
would like some money.

206
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:12,673
I'll get it from the safe.

207
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,404
I'm so upset, Rick. You know l- -

208
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,208
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

209
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm awfully sorry.

210
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:28,421
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your cafe.

211
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,324
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

212
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,895
A murderer, no less.

213
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:36,127
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

214
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:40,136
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

215
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:46,402
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

216
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,707
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

217
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,349
It will amuse your customers.

218
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:53,043
Our entertainment's enough.

219
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,680
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

220
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,357
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

221
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,719
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

222
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,454
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

223
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,564
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

224
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:09,668
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

225
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,962
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

226
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,264
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

227
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,306
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

228
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,977
How observant you are.

229
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,041
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

230
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:22,181
Yeah?

231
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,780
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

232
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,912
There are many exit visas sold in this cafe,
but we know that you've never sold one.

233
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:32,585
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

234
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,057
I thought it was because
llet you win at roulette.

235
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,456
That is another reason.

236
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:39,427
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

237
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:42,500
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

238
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:45,170
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

239
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:46,971
Victor Laszlo?

240
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,734
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

241
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,878
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

242
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:55,514
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

243
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,684
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

244
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,953
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

245
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,281
- Manages what?
- His escape.

246
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,355
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

247
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,188
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

248
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,693
This is the end of the chase.

249
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,491
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

250
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,030
Is that a serious offer?

251
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:17,563
I just paid out 20,
and I' d like to get it back.

252
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:20,566
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

253
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:22,568
- Okay.
- Done.

254
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:26,735
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

255
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,238
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

256
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,179
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I' ve seen the lady.

257
00:19:32,486 --> 00:19:35,114
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

258
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,748
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

259
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,085
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

260
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:43,524
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

261
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:47,759
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

262
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:51,297
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

263
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:53,200
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

264
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,775
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

265
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,103
Let me point out just two items:

266
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:03,405
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

267
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:07,519
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

268
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:10,019
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

269
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,521
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

270
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,926
Maybe.

271
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:17,190
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

272
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,160
I have my orders.

273
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,798
I see. Gestapo spank.

274
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,800
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

275
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:28,338
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

276
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,635
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

277
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,937
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

278
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:35,343
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

279
00:20:45,158 --> 00:20:48,355
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

280
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:53,158
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

281
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:58,499
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

282
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,400
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

283
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:13,483
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

284
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,678
- Wort you join us?
- Thank you.

285
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:20,487
- It 's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

286
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:24,061
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

287
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,198
Very well, sir.

288
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,730
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

289
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:33,531
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

290
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:35,197
I expected no less, captain.

291
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:37,033
Monsieur Ugarte.

292
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,446
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

293
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:45,682
May I first please cash my chips?

294
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,454
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

295
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,284
Rick! Rick, help me!

296
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,580
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

297
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:32,561
Excellent, captain.

298
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,394
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

299
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:37,661
I stick my neck out for nobody.

300
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:41,703
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

301
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:45,435
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

302
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:56,689
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

303
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,790
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

304
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,085
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

305
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:03,762
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

306
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:08,925
We are very honored tonight.

307
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:13,266
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

308
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,409
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

309
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,203
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

310
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:22,371
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

311
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:25,175
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

312
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,945
- What is your nationality?
- I' m a drunkard.

313
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,547
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

314
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,382
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

315
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:38,124
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

316
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:40,061
There seems to be no secret about that.

317
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:44,430
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

318
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:46,834
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

319
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,905
Can you imagine us in London?

320
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:51,510
When you get there, ask me.

321
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,171
Diplomatist.

322
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:54,506
How about New York?

323
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:59,550
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

324
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:02,953
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

325
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:07,787
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

326
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:12,260
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

327
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,266
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

328
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,007
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

329
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,939
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

330
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,340
Are my eyes really brown?

331
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:30,744
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

332
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,147
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

333
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:36,288
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

334
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:40,516
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

335
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:44,488
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

336
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:48,133
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

337
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:51,335
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

338
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,096
...until the day we marched in.

339
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:57,607
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

340
00:24:57,811 --> 00:25:00,473
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

341
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,849
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

342
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,986
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

343
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:11,590
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

344
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,656
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

345
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,795
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

346
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,562
Perhaps.

347
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:27,671
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

348
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,563
Two Cointreaux, please.

349
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,071
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

350
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,333
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

351
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:07,479
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

352
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:10,844
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the cafe.

353
00:26:11,651 --> 00:26:15,348
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

354
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:20,055
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

355
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,728
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

356
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,429
The ring is quite unique.

357
00:26:26,566 --> 00:26:30,229
- Yes, I' m very interested.
- Good.

358
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:31,792
What is your name?

359
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:34,302
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

360
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,070
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

361
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:40,838
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

362
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:44,074
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I' m sorry, it is.

363
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,013
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

364
00:26:49,222 --> 00:26:51,190
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

365
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,551
Yes, what is it you want?

366
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:55,853
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

367
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:58,758
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

368
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,399
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

369
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:05,059
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

370
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:07,170
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

371
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:11,843
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

372
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,808
That was a gross understatement.

373
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,269
You're very kind.

374
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:17,983
- Wort you join us?
- Lf you will permit me.

375
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:22,946
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

376
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:27,491
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

377
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:31,426
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

378
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,565
Somewhere I' ve seen him.

379
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,256
- Sam?
- Yes.

380
00:27:35,468 --> 00:27:37,197
He came from Paris with Rick.

381
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,837
Rick? Who is he?

382
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:42,406
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

383
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:45,873
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

384
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,775
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

385
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:52,474
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

386
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:54,977
Excuse me.

387
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:56,985
Major.

388
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:01,652
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

389
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:02,817
How do you do?

390
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,997
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

391
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:07,722
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I' m not gracious.

392
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:10,061
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

393
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:14,329
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

394
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:18,977
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I' m now on French soil.

395
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:22,978
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

396
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:24,776
This is hardly the time or place.

397
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:29,387
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

398
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:30,817
With mademoiselle.

399
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:35,518
Captain, I am under your authority.

400
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:37,720
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

401
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:41,832
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

402
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,332
Very well.

403
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:50,533
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

404
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,844
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I' m afraid for you.

405
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,910
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

406
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:33,151
I must find out what Berger knows.

407
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:36,549
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

408
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:57,069
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

409
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:59,235
Champagne cocktail, please.

410
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,809
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

411
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:05,951
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

412
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:09,088
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

413
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:12,155
As you see,
it was true every single time.

414
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:13,848
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

415
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,552
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

416
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,528
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

417
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:24,931
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

418
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:26,664
I see.

419
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:31,166
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

420
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,605
Underground, like everywhere else.

421
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:36,611
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

422
00:30:36,983 --> 00:30:38,610
If you will come...

423
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:54,463
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

424
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,761
Very well, mademoiselle.

425
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:02,238
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

426
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:06,572
Too bad you werert here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

427
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:08,313
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

428
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:11,917
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

429
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:18,887
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss llsa.

430
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:21,559
I never expected to see you again.

431
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:23,891
It's been a long time.

432
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:27,065
Yes, ma'am.
Alot of water under the bridge.

433
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:31,936
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

434
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:43,015
Where is Rick?

435
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:46,117
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

436
00:31:47,153 --> 00:31:50,520
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

437
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,419
He went home.

438
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,793
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never...

439
00:31:56,963 --> 00:31:59,363
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

440
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:01,658
Goes up there all the time.

441
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:05,898
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

442
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:10,070
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.

443
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:15,981
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

444
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:18,548
I don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.

445
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:20,641
Play it, Sam.

446
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:23,645
Play "As Time Goes By."

447
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,218
I can't remember it, Miss llsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

448
00:32:28,127 --> 00:32:30,095
I'll hum it for you.

449
00:32:41,774 --> 00:32:43,173
Sing it, Sam.

450
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:32,086
Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

451
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:45,704
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present...

452
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:48,203
- Hello, llsa.
- Hello, Rick.

453
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:51,865
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also...

454
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,442
This is Mr. Laszlo.

455
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,011
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

456
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,473
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

457
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,647
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

458
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:01,979
- Wort you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

459
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:04,019
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

460
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,125
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

461
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:11,385
- Interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

462
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:13,087
- What for?
- Your work.

463
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:14,994
Thank you. I try.

464
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:17,801
We all try. You succeed.

465
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:22,872
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

466
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:25,233
I wasrt sure you were the same.

467
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,878
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

468
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,383
How nice. You remembered.

469
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:35,349
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

470
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:37,715
Not an easy day to forget.

471
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:42,222
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

472
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,223
Yes. I put that dress away.

473
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,764
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

474
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:53,064
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

475
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,703
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

476
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,970
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

477
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,148
...to be found drinking after hours.

478
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:06,281
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

479
00:35:06,585 --> 00:35:08,177
- Your check, sir.
- It 's my party.

480
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:11,948
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

481
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:16,094
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

482
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,991
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

483
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:20,222
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

484
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:25,226
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

485
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:28,273
He hasn't played it in a long time.

486
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:31,743
- Good night.
- Good night.

487
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,538
Night.

488
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,888
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

489
00:35:44,123 --> 00:35:47,320
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

490
00:35:47,526 --> 00:35:50,086
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

491
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:51,957
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,293
Boss?

493
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,909
- Boss?
- Yeah?

494
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,470
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

495
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,615
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

496
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:46,909
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

497
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,584
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

498
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:50,948
Good, then have a drink.

499
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:53,090
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

500
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:54,783
Boss, let's get out of here.

501
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:57,518
No, sir. I' m waiting for a lady.

502
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,290
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

503
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,501
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

504
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:04,363
We'll take the car and drive all night.

505
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,403
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

506
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:11,942
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I' m staying right here.

507
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,940
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

508
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,881
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

509
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,117
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

510
00:37:27,626 --> 00:37:31,756
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

511
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:33,356
What?

512
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:35,233
My watch stopped.

513
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:38,263
I bet they're asleep in New York.

514
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,200
I bet they're asleep all over America.

515
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,178
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

516
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,342
...she walks into mine.

517
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:04,558
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

518
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,528
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

519
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,827
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

520
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:13,198
- I don't think I can remember...
- lf she can stand it, I can.

521
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:14,394
Play it.

522
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,906
Yes, boss.

523
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:49,395
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

524
00:39:49,702 --> 00:39:51,693
What did you do,
and what did you think?

525
00:39:52,304 --> 00:39:54,238
We said no questions.

526
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:00,902
Here's looking at you, kid.

527
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:36,642
A franc for your thoughts.

528
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:39,249
In America they'd bring only a penny.

529
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,652
I guess that's about all they're won'th.

530
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:46,485
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

531
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,919
Well, I was wondering...

532
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:55,132
Why I' m so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

533
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:58,430
Why there is no other man in my life?

534
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:03,003
That's easy.
There was.

535
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,500
He's dead.

536
00:41:07,446 --> 00:41:09,346
I'm sorry for asking.

537
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:12,415
I forgot we said no questions.

538
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:19,921
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

539
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:08,629
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

540
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:11,776
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

541
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:15,380
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

542
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:03,553
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

543
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:07,529
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

544
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:10,998
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

545
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:12,431
You said it.

546
00:43:12,638 --> 00:43:14,572
Here's looking at you, kid.

547
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,824
My Germars a little rusty.

548
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,695
It's the Gestapo.

549
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:51,472
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

550
00:43:52,678 --> 00:43:56,114
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

551
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:02,387
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

552
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:04,248
It's pretty bad timing.

553
00:44:04,556 --> 00:44:08,185
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

554
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:11,261
Let's see.

555
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:15,398
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

556
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:17,524
Looking for a job.

557
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:25,733
Was that cannon fire?

558
00:44:26,778 --> 00:44:28,177
Or is it my heart pounding?

559
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,407
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

560
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:36,914
And getting closer every minute.

561
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,216
Here, here, drink up.

562
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:41,787
We'll never finish the other three.

563
00:44:41,994 --> 00:44:45,430
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

564
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:47,724
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

565
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:50,891
Ileft a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

566
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:52,734
It's strange.

567
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:57,340
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

568
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:59,875
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

569
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:04,046
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

570
00:45:04,249 --> 00:45:05,375
No, we must leave.

571
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:07,785
Yes, of course. We.

572
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,717
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

573
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,922
Not at my hotel. I...

574
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:18,690
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

575
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:20,924
I'll meet you at the station.

576
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,326
All right, at a quarter to 5.

577
00:45:23,568 --> 00:45:25,399
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

578
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,770
That's too far ahead to plan.

579
00:45:31,943 --> 00:45:33,740
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

580
00:45:35,047 --> 00:45:38,574
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

581
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:42,781
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

582
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,216
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

583
00:45:52,764 --> 00:45:54,459
Llove you so much.

584
00:45:57,135 --> 00:45:59,603
And I hate this war so much.

585
00:46:01,573 --> 00:46:04,303
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

586
00:46:05,944 --> 00:46:07,912
If you shouldn't get away...

587
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:12,014
If something should keep us apart...

588
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:14,818
...wherever they put you...

589
00:46:14,986 --> 00:46:18,251
...and wherever I' II be,
I want you to know that I...

590
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:25,091
Kiss me.

591
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,431
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

592
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:05,903
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

593
00:47:06,071 --> 00:47:08,562
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

594
00:47:08,807 --> 00:47:10,866
But this note came just after you left.

595
00:47:26,024 --> 00:47:27,719
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

596
00:47:28,493 --> 00:47:29,960
Do you hear me?

597
00:47:30,695 --> 00:47:33,630
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

598
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,080
Rick, I have to talk to you.

599
00:48:28,486 --> 00:48:31,785
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

600
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,084
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

601
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:40,053
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

602
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:42,664
I wouldn't have come
if I' d known you were here.

603
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,369
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

604
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:48,938
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

605
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:51,200
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

606
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:55,043
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

607
00:48:55,947 --> 00:48:57,744
I can understand how you feel.

608
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:00,744
You understand how I feel.

609
00:49:01,486 --> 00:49:03,215
How long was it we had, honey?

610
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:06,350
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

611
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:08,090
Every one of them.

612
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,660
Mostly I remember the last one.

613
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:15,427
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

614
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,329
...with a comical look on his face...

615
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:19,470
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

616
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:23,666
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

617
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:26,333
Does it got a wild finish?

618
00:49:26,544 --> 00:49:28,671
I don't know the finish yet.

619
00:49:28,847 --> 00:49:32,283
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

620
00:49:34,753 --> 00:49:38,519
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

621
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,419
At the house of some friends...

622
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:43,459
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

623
00:49:43,628 --> 00:49:46,825
A very great and courageous man.

624
00:49:47,198 --> 00:49:49,496
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

625
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:52,262
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

626
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:56,539
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

627
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,471
And she looked up to him...

628
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,210
...and worshiped him...

629
00:50:00,412 --> 00:50:03,210
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

630
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:05,508
Yes, that's very pretty.

631
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:09,381
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

632
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:12,352
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

633
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:14,856
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

634
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:20,321
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

635
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,433
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

636
00:50:26,604 --> 00:50:27,662
Tell me...

637
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,699
...who was it you left me for?

638
00:50:30,909 --> 00:50:33,742
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

639
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:36,811
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

640
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,667
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

641
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:08,243
I would suggest you search
the cafe immediately.

642
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:11,439
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

643
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:13,707
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

644
00:51:13,918 --> 00:51:16,512
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

645
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:18,713
We mustrt underestimate
American blundering.

646
00:51:18,923 --> 00:51:22,859
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

647
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:25,928
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

648
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:29,931
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

649
00:51:35,006 --> 00:51:37,634
There is nothing we can do.

650
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:41,339
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

651
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:42,480
I slept very well.

652
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,240
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

653
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:50,419
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Wort you sit down?

654
00:51:52,624 --> 00:51:55,991
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

655
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:58,493
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

656
00:51:58,963 --> 00:52:00,453
You have reached Casablanca.

657
00:52:00,732 --> 00:52:03,428
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

658
00:52:03,668 --> 00:52:05,727
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

659
00:52:05,937 --> 00:52:08,701
Not at all. Renault 's signature
is necessary on every visa.

660
00:52:08,873 --> 00:52:11,569
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

661
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:14,075
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

662
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:16,303
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

663
00:52:16,948 --> 00:52:18,643
And mademoiselle?

664
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:22,309
- You needrt be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

665
00:52:22,554 --> 00:52:25,455
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

666
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:28,285
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

667
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,394
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

668
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:32,757
- On one condition.
- And that is?

669
00:52:33,031 --> 00:52:36,228
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

670
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:37,765
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

671
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:40,233
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

672
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:42,963
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

673
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,802
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

674
00:52:45,977 --> 00:52:47,740
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

675
00:52:48,012 --> 00:52:50,674
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

676
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:53,577
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

677
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:57,521
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

678
00:52:59,057 --> 00:53:01,548
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

679
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,694
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

680
00:53:04,896 --> 00:53:07,456
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

681
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:10,332
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

682
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,025
What if you murdered all of us?

683
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,604
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

684
00:53:16,774 --> 00:53:19,106
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

685
00:53:19,277 --> 00:53:22,769
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

686
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:24,539
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

687
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:27,274
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

688
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:28,975
But there is one exception.

689
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,814
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

690
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,891
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

691
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,591
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

692
00:53:37,762 --> 00:53:39,286
This is still unoccupied France.

693
00:53:39,797 --> 00:53:42,630
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

694
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,496
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

695
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:49,766
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

696
00:53:51,409 --> 00:53:54,276
I believe you have a message for him?

697
00:53:54,445 --> 00:53:56,709
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

698
00:53:57,248 --> 00:54:00,240
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

699
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:02,316
Signor Ugarte is dead.

700
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,417
I'm making out the report now.

701
00:54:10,595 --> 00:54:13,189
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

702
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:15,730
...or died trying to escape.

703
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:20,064
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

704
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:21,761
Good day.

705
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:28,805
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

706
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,004
Excuse me, captain.

707
00:54:30,214 --> 00:54:33,206
Another visa problem has come up.

708
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:36,586
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

709
00:54:45,263 --> 00:54:48,289
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

710
00:54:48,466 --> 00:54:51,230
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

711
00:54:51,402 --> 00:54:53,597
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

712
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:56,399
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

713
00:54:56,608 --> 00:54:58,667
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

714
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:01,004
Thanks.

715
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:14,256
Don't be too downearted.

716
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,518
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

717
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:18,025
Thank you very much, signor.

718
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:20,630
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

719
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:22,959
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

720
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,192
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

721
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,602
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

722
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:31,742
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

723
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:33,206
Here, sit down.

724
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:36,039
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

725
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:37,841
Bourbon.

726
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:40,050
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

727
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:43,415
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

728
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:46,619
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

729
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:48,816
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

730
00:55:48,993 --> 00:55:50,290
Practically no one.

731
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:52,759
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

732
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:55,090
So could I,
and I' m a poor businessman.

733
00:55:55,299 --> 00:55:59,133
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I' II handle the entire transaction.

734
00:55:59,303 --> 00:56:02,170
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

735
00:56:02,373 --> 00:56:03,863
And the carrying charges?

736
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:06,806
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

737
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:09,912
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

738
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:11,639
I'll tell him when he comes in.

739
00:56:11,816 --> 00:56:14,444
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

740
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:17,916
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

741
00:56:23,628 --> 00:56:26,654
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

742
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:30,164
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

743
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:32,268
Excuse me, I' II be getting back.

744
00:56:35,873 --> 00:56:39,604
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

745
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:46,910
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

746
00:56:47,118 --> 00:56:48,415
Only 700 francs.

747
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:51,782
- You're being cheated.
- Doesrt matter, thank you.

748
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:55,084
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

749
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,818
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

750
00:56:57,995 --> 00:57:01,658
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

751
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:02,822
Doesrt matter.

752
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,936
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

753
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:10,131
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

754
00:57:10,341 --> 00:57:11,933
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

755
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,806
- Thank you. I' m really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

756
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:18,608
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

757
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:19,807
Yes.

758
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:22,350
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

759
00:57:22,587 --> 00:57:24,111
I don't think I will, Rick.

760
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:28,588
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I' m entitled to know.

761
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,955
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

762
00:57:31,629 --> 00:57:34,860
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

763
00:57:35,032 --> 00:57:37,592
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

764
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:42,163
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

765
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:47,368
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

766
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:52,346
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

767
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:53,943
Not last night.

768
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:57,850
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

769
00:57:58,022 --> 00:58:00,923
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

770
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:02,787
You can believe that if you want to.

771
00:58:02,994 --> 00:58:05,724
Well, I' m not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

772
00:58:05,897 --> 00:58:07,694
Above a saloon, it's true...

773
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:09,332
...but walk up a flight...

774
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,229
...I' II be expecting you.

775
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:16,102
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

776
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:18,003
You'll be there.

777
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:20,568
No, Rick.

778
00:58:21,979 --> 00:58:24,243
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

779
00:58:25,283 --> 00:58:28,844
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

780
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:37,986
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I' m not able to help him.

781
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:40,062
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

782
00:58:40,264 --> 00:58:44,826
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

783
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:48,438
But it would not be won'th my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

784
00:58:48,606 --> 00:58:50,437
You, however, are a different matter.

785
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:55,244
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

786
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,808
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

787
00:58:59,016 --> 00:59:02,281
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

788
00:59:02,453 --> 00:59:04,250
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

789
00:59:04,422 --> 00:59:07,880
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

790
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:10,486
We are only interested in two visas.

791
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:12,925
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

792
00:59:13,264 --> 00:59:15,357
You two will want to discuss this.

793
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,501
Excuse me. I' II be at the bar.

794
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,169
No, llsa.
I won't let you stay here.

795
00:59:23,341 --> 00:59:26,708
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

796
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:28,741
But if the situation were different...

797
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:31,473
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

798
00:59:31,649 --> 00:59:32,946
...would you take it?

799
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:35,243
Yes, I would.

800
00:59:36,454 --> 00:59:37,648
Yes, I see.

801
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:42,725
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

802
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:46,955
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

803
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:48,928
...why didn't you leave me then?

804
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:52,725
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

805
00:59:55,206 --> 00:59:56,673
Ilove you very much, llsa.

806
00:59:57,875 --> 00:59:59,968
Your secret will be safe with me.

807
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:03,138
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

808
01:00:03,314 --> 01:00:05,646
Not more than 50 francs.

809
01:00:10,388 --> 01:00:12,185
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

810
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:15,723
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

811
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:17,861
Well, good luck, but be careful.

812
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:20,862
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

813
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:24,224
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

814
01:00:24,435 --> 01:00:27,131
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

815
01:00:27,305 --> 01:00:29,205
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

816
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:32,570
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

817
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:33,732
Yes, something.

818
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:37,108
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

819
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:39,272
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

820
01:00:39,483 --> 01:00:42,509
But I' d guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

821
01:00:44,422 --> 01:00:47,619
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

822
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:49,452
But it is won'th a chance.

823
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:52,825
Thank you very much.
Good day.

824
01:00:53,064 --> 01:00:56,761
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

825
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:59,801
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

826
01:00:59,971 --> 01:01:02,405
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

827
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:13,443
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

828
01:01:13,951 --> 01:01:15,782
- I' d better be going.
- My check, please.

829
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:19,718
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

830
01:01:19,924 --> 01:01:22,757
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

831
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:24,554
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

832
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:26,390
I'm sorry.

833
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:45,943
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

834
01:01:47,985 --> 01:01:50,351
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

835
01:01:50,521 --> 01:01:52,421
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

836
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:54,955
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

837
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:57,117
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

838
01:01:57,294 --> 01:01:59,558
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

839
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,857
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

840
01:02:02,033 --> 01:02:03,967
You know how
that impresses Germans.

841
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:07,600
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

842
01:02:07,972 --> 01:02:10,065
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

843
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:15,168
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

844
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:17,943
It looks like you're a little late.

845
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:26,917
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

846
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:30,857
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

847
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:34,754
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I' II see you later.

848
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,032
Sascha!

849
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:38,225
French 75s.

850
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:42,099
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

851
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:43,604
We will begin with two.

852
01:02:52,683 --> 01:02:54,878
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

853
01:02:55,086 --> 01:02:58,453
- What I said is none of your business.
- I' II make it my business.

854
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:08,291
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

855
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,228
You see, captain?

856
01:03:14,472 --> 01:03:16,872
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

857
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:18,939
We try to cooperate
with your government.

858
01:03:19,143 --> 01:03:21,407
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

859
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:23,740
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

860
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:26,209
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

861
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:27,714
I blow with the wind...

862
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:30,285
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

863
01:03:30,488 --> 01:03:32,183
And if it should change?

864
01:03:32,456 --> 01:03:34,617
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

865
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,885
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

866
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:40,495
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

867
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:43,694
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

868
01:03:43,868 --> 01:03:45,426
Aleader? Like Laszlo?

869
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,401
I have been thinking.

870
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:51,037
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

871
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:52,197
I see what you mean.

872
01:03:58,115 --> 01:03:59,980
Thank you, Carl.

873
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:02,414
Thank you, Carl.

874
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,554
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

875
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:07,323
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

876
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:08,583
Thank you very much.

877
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:11,522
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

878
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:13,560
...and a third glass.

879
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,722
At last the day's came!

880
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,733
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

881
01:04:18,903 --> 01:04:21,770
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

882
01:04:21,939 --> 01:04:23,600
A very nice idea.

883
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:25,169
To America.

884
01:04:25,943 --> 01:04:26,932
To America.

885
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:35,917
What watch?

886
01:04:36,787 --> 01:04:39,779
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

887
01:04:41,425 --> 01:04:43,757
You will get along beautifully in America.

888
01:04:44,762 --> 01:04:46,525
How is lady luck treating you?

889
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:48,561
Oh, too bad.

890
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:50,764
You'll find him over there.

891
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:58,531
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

892
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:01,940
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

893
01:05:02,112 --> 01:05:04,444
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

894
01:05:04,615 --> 01:05:05,946
My husband is with me too.

895
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,880
He is? Captain Renault 's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

896
01:05:09,053 --> 01:05:10,042
Have a drink?

897
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:12,917
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

898
01:05:13,524 --> 01:05:14,582
Monsieur Rick...

899
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:18,887
...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

900
01:05:19,063 --> 01:05:20,052
No, I mean...

901
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,058
...is he trustwon'thy?
Is his word...?

902
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:26,369
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

903
01:05:26,537 --> 01:05:28,596
I thought so. Where's your husband?

904
01:05:28,872 --> 01:05:33,138
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

905
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,107
Oh, of course he's losing.

906
01:05:35,346 --> 01:05:38,247
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

907
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:40,910
We come from Bulgaria.

908
01:05:41,518 --> 01:05:43,748
Things are very bad there.

909
01:05:43,921 --> 01:05:46,116
The devil has the people
by the throat.

910
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:49,048
So Jan and I, we...

911
01:05:49,226 --> 01:05:51,922
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

912
01:05:52,129 --> 01:05:54,495
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

913
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:57,065
But we haven't much money...

914
01:05:57,234 --> 01:05:59,702
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

915
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:02,129
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

916
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:04,671
And then Captain Renault sees us...

917
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:07,844
...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I' II bet.

918
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:11,205
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

919
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:13,014
But we have no money.

920
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:14,909
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

921
01:06:15,085 --> 01:06:17,417
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

922
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:20,557
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

923
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:22,751
He always has.

924
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:29,956
You are a man.

925
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:32,796
If someone loved you very much...

926
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:37,235
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

927
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:40,675
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

928
01:06:41,178 --> 01:06:44,272
...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

929
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:48,282
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

930
01:06:48,452 --> 01:06:50,249
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

931
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:52,548
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

932
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:54,149
Go back to Bulgaria.

933
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:58,623
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

934
01:06:59,863 --> 01:07:03,959
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

935
01:07:04,134 --> 01:07:07,570
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

936
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:10,138
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

937
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:13,469
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

938
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:23,483
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

939
01:07:23,654 --> 01:07:27,181
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

940
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,589
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

941
01:07:31,161 --> 01:07:34,324
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

942
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:36,863
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

943
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:39,692
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

944
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,633
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:07:41,805 --> 01:07:43,602
Right this way, if you please.

946
01:07:43,774 --> 01:07:47,540
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

947
01:07:47,778 --> 01:07:49,040
Thank you.

948
01:07:58,455 --> 01:08:01,083
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

949
01:08:24,181 --> 01:08:26,741
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

950
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:29,013
No. No, I guess not.

951
01:08:29,186 --> 01:08:31,051
Have you tried 22 tonight?

952
01:08:32,623 --> 01:08:34,022
I said 22.

953
01:08:50,374 --> 01:08:51,705
Leave it there.

954
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,555
Cash it in and don't come back.

955
01:09:11,328 --> 01:09:13,319
Are you sure this place is honest?

956
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:17,731
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

957
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:22,002
How are we doing tonight?

958
01:09:22,339 --> 01:09:25,001
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

959
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:30,680
Monsieur Rick...

960
01:09:35,719 --> 01:09:37,346
He's just a lucky guy.

961
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:42,958
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

962
01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:45,185
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

963
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:50,189
Captain Renault, may l- -?

964
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:54,326
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

965
01:09:54,505 --> 01:09:57,235
- We'll be there at 6.
- I' II be there at 10.

966
01:09:57,407 --> 01:09:59,272
I'm very happy for both of you.

967
01:09:59,443 --> 01:10:01,536
Still, it's very strange that you won.

968
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:03,976
Well, maybe not so strange.

969
01:10:04,147 --> 01:10:06,980
- I' II see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

970
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:08,976
No!

971
01:10:14,691 --> 01:10:17,592
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

972
01:10:18,362 --> 01:10:20,796
Go away, you crazy Russian.

973
01:10:30,741 --> 01:10:34,507
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

974
01:10:34,678 --> 01:10:36,873
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

975
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,911
Put it down as a gesture to love.

976
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:40,606
Well, I' II forgive you this time.

977
01:10:40,817 --> 01:10:43,650
But I' II be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

978
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,015
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

979
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:53,221
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

980
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,022
Well, isn't there some other place?

981
01:10:55,232 --> 01:10:57,723
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

982
01:10:59,703 --> 01:11:01,933
- In my office.
- Right.

983
01:11:03,006 --> 01:11:05,668
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

984
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:08,834
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

985
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:10,775
You know what I' ve been doing.

986
01:11:10,948 --> 01:11:14,884
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

987
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:17,316
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

988
01:11:17,487 --> 01:11:18,920
I'm not interested in politics.

989
01:11:19,089 --> 01:11:21,580
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

990
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:22,950
I'm a saloonkeeper.

991
01:11:23,293 --> 01:11:26,854
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

992
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,554
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

993
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:31,599
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

994
01:11:31,768 --> 01:11:34,931
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

995
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:37,072
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

996
01:11:37,274 --> 01:11:39,504
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

997
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:43,043
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

998
01:11:43,213 --> 01:11:46,080
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

999
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,975
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1000
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:50,983
My answer would still be the same.

1001
01:11:51,154 --> 01:11:53,315
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1002
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:54,649
There is.

1003
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:57,252
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1004
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,189
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1005
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:02,964
- My wife?
- Yes.

1006
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:45,364
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1007
01:14:01,418 --> 01:14:05,411
See what I mean? If Laszlo 's presence in
a cafe can inspire this demonstration...

1008
01:14:05,589 --> 01:14:08,057
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1009
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:10,216
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1010
01:14:10,494 --> 01:14:13,463
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1011
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:14,824
The place is to be closed.

1012
01:14:14,998 --> 01:14:18,058
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1013
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:24,600
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1014
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:27,071
This cafe is closed until further notice.

1015
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:28,902
Clear the room at once.

1016
01:14:32,349 --> 01:14:33,714
How can you close me up?

1017
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:37,375
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1018
01:14:37,554 --> 01:14:39,454
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1019
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:40,885
Everybody out at once.

1020
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:49,264
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1021
01:14:49,432 --> 01:14:52,230
This morning you implied it wasrt safe
to leave Casablanca.

1022
01:14:52,402 --> 01:14:55,337
That is also true, except for one destination:
Occupied France.

1023
01:14:55,539 --> 01:14:58,440
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1024
01:14:58,675 --> 01:14:59,664
Of what value is that?

1025
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:02,869
You may recall what German guarantees
have been won'th in the past.

1026
01:15:03,046 --> 01:15:06,311
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1027
01:15:06,483 --> 01:15:10,783
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1028
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:12,046
The other alternative?

1029
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:16,989
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1030
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,491
Good night, mademoiselle.

1031
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:32,698
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1032
01:15:55,632 --> 01:15:57,623
Our faithful friend is still there.

1033
01:15:58,168 --> 01:16:00,693
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1034
01:16:00,937 --> 01:16:02,029
I must.

1035
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:05,663
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1036
01:16:05,842 --> 01:16:09,175
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I' m frightened.

1037
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:11,210
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1038
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:13,815
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1039
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:15,644
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1040
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:18,714
Whatever I' d say,
you would carry on.

1041
01:16:19,589 --> 01:16:22,524
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1042
01:16:22,692 --> 01:16:25,058
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1043
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:26,786
But no intention of selling them.

1044
01:16:26,963 --> 01:16:30,660
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1045
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:32,392
Did he give any reason?

1046
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:35,867
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1047
01:16:36,072 --> 01:16:38,233
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1048
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:40,972
I don't know why he said that.

1049
01:16:53,523 --> 01:16:56,253
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1050
01:16:57,627 --> 01:16:59,458
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1051
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:04,022
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1052
01:17:05,302 --> 01:17:07,566
When I was in the concentration camp...

1053
01:17:08,138 --> 01:17:10,663
...were you lonely in Paris?

1054
01:17:12,142 --> 01:17:14,133
Yes, Victor, I was.

1055
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:18,080
I know how it is to be lonely.

1056
01:17:19,149 --> 01:17:21,481
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1057
01:17:23,486 --> 01:17:25,477
No, Victor, there isn't.

1058
01:17:30,126 --> 01:17:32,651
Ilove you very much, my dear.

1059
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:37,990
Yes, I know.

1060
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:41,269
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1061
01:17:41,438 --> 01:17:44,134
You don't even have to say it.

1062
01:17:44,307 --> 01:17:46,070
I'll believe.

1063
01:17:48,178 --> 01:17:49,509
Good night, dear.

1064
01:17:51,514 --> 01:17:52,845
Good night.

1065
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:02,551
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1066
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:09,229
Be careful.

1067
01:18:10,834 --> 01:18:12,392
Of course I' II be careful.

1068
01:18:55,745 --> 01:18:58,942
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1069
01:18:59,115 --> 01:19:00,912
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1070
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:02,881
Two weeks, maybe three.

1071
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:05,316
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1072
01:19:05,522 --> 01:19:07,752
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1073
01:19:07,924 --> 01:19:09,289
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1074
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:12,826
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1075
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:16,229
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl
- I will.

1076
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:19,527
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1077
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:20,896
I won't.

1078
01:19:22,072 --> 01:19:23,130
Good night.

1079
01:19:24,274 --> 01:19:25,866
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1080
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:45,926
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1081
01:19:46,096 --> 01:19:49,429
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1082
01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:50,827
Well, won't you sit down?

1083
01:19:51,034 --> 01:19:54,936
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1084
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:58,404
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1085
01:19:58,608 --> 01:20:01,304
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1086
01:20:01,478 --> 01:20:04,106
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1087
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,840
I went all through that
with your husband. It 's no deal.

1088
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:09,146
I know how you feel about me...

1089
01:20:09,319 --> 01:20:12,083
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1090
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:14,723
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1091
01:20:14,891 --> 01:20:16,882
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1092
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,391
It was your cause too.

1093
01:20:18,595 --> 01:20:21,063
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1094
01:20:21,498 --> 01:20:24,194
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1095
01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:26,425
I'm the only cause I' m interested in.

1096
01:20:33,009 --> 01:20:36,536
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you...

1097
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:39,648
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1098
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:43,274
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1099
01:20:43,453 --> 01:20:45,512
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1100
01:20:45,688 --> 01:20:48,714
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1101
01:20:52,962 --> 01:20:55,692
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1102
01:20:55,865 --> 01:20:58,629
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1103
01:20:59,269 --> 01:21:03,365
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1104
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,065
You're a coward and a weakling.

1105
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:12,346
No. Oh, Richard. I' m sorry.

1106
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:16,385
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1107
01:21:16,553 --> 01:21:19,249
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1108
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:20,478
What of it?

1109
01:21:20,657 --> 01:21:23,319
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1110
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,997
Now, if you'll...

1111
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,667
All right.

1112
01:21:35,838 --> 01:21:37,863
I tried to reason with you.

1113
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:40,271
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1114
01:21:40,677 --> 01:21:43,805
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1115
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:47,246
Put them on the table.

1116
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:50,141
No.

1117
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:53,347
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1118
01:21:54,657 --> 01:21:58,650
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1119
01:22:00,063 --> 01:22:02,054
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1120
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:08,197
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1121
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:15,009
Richard...

1122
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:17,544
...I tried to stay away.

1123
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:20,576
I thought I would never see you again.

1124
01:22:21,718 --> 01:22:24,186
That you were out of my life.

1125
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,465
The day you left Paris...

1126
01:22:48,044 --> 01:22:50,035
...if you knew what I went through.

1127
01:22:51,714 --> 01:22:54,376
If you knew how much I loved you.

1128
01:22:55,385 --> 01:22:58,218
How much I still love you.

1129
01:23:12,101 --> 01:23:13,125
And then?

1130
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:19,505
It wasrt long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1131
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:23,203
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1132
01:23:23,379 --> 01:23:25,108
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1133
01:23:25,281 --> 01:23:27,909
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1134
01:23:29,085 --> 01:23:31,417
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1135
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:32,916
Then it came.

1136
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:35,283
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1137
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:39,083
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1138
01:23:40,496 --> 01:23:41,929
Then I met you.

1139
01:23:42,265 --> 01:23:45,598
Why werert you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1140
01:23:45,802 --> 01:23:48,862
It wasrt my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1141
01:23:49,072 --> 01:23:51,597
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1142
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:55,010
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1143
01:23:55,211 --> 01:23:58,510
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1144
01:23:58,681 --> 01:24:00,205
...and for those working with us.

1145
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,182
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1146
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,745
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1147
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:09,357
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1148
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:12,653
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1149
01:24:12,995 --> 01:24:14,986
He was sick. He needed me.

1150
01:24:16,566 --> 01:24:19,194
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1151
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:23,328
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1152
01:24:24,374 --> 01:24:26,103
Well...

1153
01:24:26,442 --> 01:24:28,103
...well, you know the rest.

1154
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,140
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1155
01:24:34,317 --> 01:24:35,443
What about now?

1156
01:24:36,686 --> 01:24:37,675
Now?

1157
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:40,012
I don't know.

1158
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,716
I know that I' II never have the strength
to leave you again.

1159
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:45,985
And Laszlo?

1160
01:24:46,362 --> 01:24:49,593
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1161
01:24:49,766 --> 01:24:53,099
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1162
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:54,759
All except one.

1163
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:57,672
He won't have you.

1164
01:24:59,809 --> 01:25:01,572
I can't fight it anymore.

1165
01:25:03,346 --> 01:25:05,678
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1166
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,711
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1167
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:13,947
You have to think for both of us.

1168
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:16,356
For all of us.

1169
01:25:19,962 --> 01:25:22,624
All right. I will.

1170
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:28,464
Here's looking at you, kid.

1171
01:25:30,273 --> 01:25:33,367
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1172
01:25:45,755 --> 01:25:47,814
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1173
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:51,153
- I' m afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1174
01:25:55,465 --> 01:26:00,334
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1175
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,333
Thank you.

1176
01:26:19,789 --> 01:26:21,950
Carl, what happened?

1177
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:25,753
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1178
01:26:25,962 --> 01:26:28,260
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1179
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:31,730
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1180
01:26:31,934 --> 01:26:34,630
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1181
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:37,568
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1182
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,740
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1183
01:26:59,729 --> 01:27:02,857
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1184
01:27:03,032 --> 01:27:04,795
This might come in handy.

1185
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:06,093
Thank you.

1186
01:27:06,335 --> 01:27:08,929
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1187
01:27:10,973 --> 01:27:13,703
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's won'th all this?

1188
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:15,810
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1189
01:27:16,812 --> 01:27:18,905
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1190
01:27:19,081 --> 01:27:20,639
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1191
01:27:20,816 --> 01:27:23,250
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1192
01:27:23,419 --> 01:27:25,683
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1193
01:27:25,855 --> 01:27:28,016
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1194
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:32,354
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1195
01:27:32,528 --> 01:27:36,123
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1196
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:39,191
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1197
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:42,629
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1198
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:44,396
...and that you'll never succeed.

1199
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:46,804
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1200
01:27:48,611 --> 01:27:51,205
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1201
01:27:51,581 --> 01:27:53,776
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1202
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:55,746
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1203
01:27:55,918 --> 01:27:58,819
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1204
01:27:58,988 --> 01:28:01,149
The first evening I came into this cafe...

1205
01:28:01,324 --> 01:28:03,690
...I knew there was something
between you and llsa.

1206
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:06,154
Since no one is to blame...

1207
01:28:06,596 --> 01:28:08,587
...I demand no explanation.

1208
01:28:08,764 --> 01:28:12,063
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1209
01:28:12,234 --> 01:28:13,792
All right.

1210
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,904
But I want my wife to be safe.

1211
01:28:16,172 --> 01:28:17,605
I ask you as a favor...

1212
01:28:17,773 --> 01:28:20,708
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1213
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:21,968
You love her that much?

1214
01:28:22,178 --> 01:28:24,942
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1215
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:28,106
Well, I am also a human being.

1216
01:28:28,951 --> 01:28:30,441
Yes, I love her that much.

1217
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:39,557
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1218
01:28:39,729 --> 01:28:42,254
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1219
01:28:42,431 --> 01:28:43,420
On what charge?

1220
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:45,794
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1221
01:28:45,968 --> 01:28:48,698
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1222
01:29:00,483 --> 01:29:04,647
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1223
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:08,881
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1224
01:29:09,058 --> 01:29:12,084
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1225
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:13,728
If you were to help him escape...

1226
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:16,330
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1227
01:29:16,499 --> 01:29:18,967
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1228
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:22,229
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1229
01:29:22,438 --> 01:29:25,498
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1230
01:29:25,675 --> 01:29:27,540
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1231
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:29,109
They're all excellent reasons.

1232
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:31,212
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1233
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:34,838
In this matter I' m powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1234
01:29:35,184 --> 01:29:39,746
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1235
01:29:39,922 --> 01:29:41,412
Yes, I have the letters.

1236
01:29:41,624 --> 01:29:43,421
But I intend using them myself.

1237
01:29:43,826 --> 01:29:47,353
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1238
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:50,590
And I' m taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1239
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:52,734
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1240
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:56,497
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1241
01:29:56,672 --> 01:29:58,697
The last man I want to see in America.

1242
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:02,138
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1243
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:05,474
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1244
01:30:05,648 --> 01:30:08,276
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1245
01:30:08,484 --> 01:30:12,682
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to llsa and me.

1246
01:30:12,922 --> 01:30:14,890
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1247
01:30:15,057 --> 01:30:18,584
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1248
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:22,128
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife.

1249
01:30:22,298 --> 01:30:24,994
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1250
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:26,691
Louis, I' II make a deal with you.

1251
01:30:26,869 --> 01:30:30,396
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1252
01:30:30,573 --> 01:30:33,838
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1253
01:30:34,009 --> 01:30:36,603
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1254
01:30:36,779 --> 01:30:38,940
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1255
01:30:39,148 --> 01:30:40,172
Then release him.

1256
01:30:40,349 --> 01:30:42,977
You be at my place a half -hour
before the plane leaves.

1257
01:30:43,152 --> 01:30:45,677
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1258
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,482
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1259
01:30:48,758 --> 01:30:51,056
You get him, and we get away.

1260
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:54,128
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1261
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,128
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1262
01:30:57,333 --> 01:31:00,029
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1263
01:31:00,202 --> 01:31:02,534
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1264
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:05,333
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1265
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:08,341
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1266
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:11,378
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1267
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:16,007
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1268
01:31:16,285 --> 01:31:17,547
Oh, thanks.

1269
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:19,279
Go ahead, Ricky.

1270
01:31:19,488 --> 01:31:23,857
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1271
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:26,358
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1272
01:31:33,969 --> 01:31:36,529
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1273
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:39,970
Certainly not good enough.
But since I' m in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1274
01:31:40,276 --> 01:31:43,609
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1275
01:31:43,813 --> 01:31:49,217
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1276
01:31:49,385 --> 01:31:52,183
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's won'th 25.

1277
01:31:52,354 --> 01:31:55,323
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1278
01:31:55,524 --> 01:31:57,958
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1279
01:31:58,127 --> 01:31:59,458
Well, so long.

1280
01:31:59,628 --> 01:32:02,654
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 can'tons of American cigarettes.

1281
01:32:02,832 --> 01:32:05,323
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1282
01:32:40,302 --> 01:32:43,032
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1283
01:32:43,205 --> 01:32:44,502
...so I knew I' d be on time.

1284
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:47,699
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1285
01:32:47,877 --> 01:32:49,970
This place will never be
the same without you.

1286
01:32:50,179 --> 01:32:53,706
I know what you mean. But I' ve spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1287
01:32:53,883 --> 01:32:56,613
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1288
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:58,980
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1289
01:32:59,154 --> 01:33:00,314
Sam's piano.

1290
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,990
Serves me right for not being musical.

1291
01:33:03,259 --> 01:33:04,283
Here they are.

1292
01:33:04,793 --> 01:33:06,522
You better wait in my office.

1293
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:18,832
Victor thinks I' m leaving with him.
Havert you told him?

1294
01:33:19,008 --> 01:33:21,442
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1295
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:22,975
Everything is quite all right.

1296
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:26,171
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1297
01:33:26,348 --> 01:33:28,179
Please trust me.

1298
01:33:30,219 --> 01:33:31,447
Yes, I will.

1299
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:40,755
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1300
01:33:42,564 --> 01:33:45,658
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1301
01:33:46,068 --> 01:33:47,968
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1302
01:33:48,137 --> 01:33:51,436
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It 's all arranged.

1303
01:33:51,607 --> 01:33:53,939
Good. I' ve got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1304
01:33:54,109 --> 01:33:56,543
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1305
01:33:56,712 --> 01:33:58,111
Victor Laszlo.

1306
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:01,377
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1307
01:34:03,986 --> 01:34:07,979
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1308
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:11,821
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1309
01:34:12,027 --> 01:34:14,996
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1310
01:34:15,798 --> 01:34:20,235
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1311
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:22,393
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1312
01:34:22,571 --> 01:34:24,698
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1313
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,738
...but I will if you take one more step.

1314
01:34:27,443 --> 01:34:29,673
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1315
01:34:32,915 --> 01:34:36,407
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1316
01:34:36,585 --> 01:34:38,712
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1317
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:40,479
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1318
01:34:40,656 --> 01:34:43,284
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1319
01:34:43,459 --> 01:34:45,859
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1320
01:34:46,028 --> 01:34:48,121
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1321
01:34:55,671 --> 01:34:57,730
Hello? Is that the airport?

1322
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:00,702
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1323
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:03,469
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1324
01:35:03,645 --> 01:35:05,442
There's to be no trouble about them.

1325
01:35:05,881 --> 01:35:06,870
Good.

1326
01:35:07,316 --> 01:35:08,476
Hello?

1327
01:35:13,589 --> 01:35:14,988
My car, quickly!

1328
01:35:16,658 --> 01:35:17,750
This is Major Strasser.

1329
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:20,394
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1330
01:35:20,562 --> 01:35:21,859
At once, do you hear?

1331
01:35:29,004 --> 01:35:31,029
Hello, radio tower?

1332
01:35:31,206 --> 01:35:34,300
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1333
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:37,044
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1334
01:35:37,212 --> 01:35:41,148
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1335
01:35:41,316 --> 01:35:44,046
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1336
01:35:56,565 --> 01:35:59,295
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1337
01:35:59,468 --> 01:36:01,231
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1338
01:36:01,437 --> 01:36:04,838
- Find Laszlo 's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1339
01:36:05,007 --> 01:36:05,996
This way, please.

1340
01:36:07,876 --> 01:36:11,004
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1341
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:13,205
You think of everything, don't you?

1342
01:36:13,382 --> 01:36:15,816
And the names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1343
01:36:16,018 --> 01:36:19,579
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1344
01:36:19,755 --> 01:36:21,347
I don't understand.
What about you?

1345
01:36:21,523 --> 01:36:23,616
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1346
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:25,783
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1347
01:36:25,961 --> 01:36:27,758
Last night we said a great many things.

1348
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:29,830
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1349
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:32,660
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1350
01:36:32,835 --> 01:36:35,497
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1351
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,502
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1352
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:40,574
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1353
01:36:40,742 --> 01:36:44,041
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1354
01:36:44,213 --> 01:36:46,477
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1355
01:36:46,648 --> 01:36:50,084
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I' m saying it because it's true.

1356
01:36:50,285 --> 01:36:52,515
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1357
01:36:52,688 --> 01:36:55,054
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1358
01:36:55,224 --> 01:36:58,091
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1359
01:36:58,293 --> 01:37:01,785
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1360
01:37:02,664 --> 01:37:04,757
But what about us?

1361
01:37:04,933 --> 01:37:06,332
We'll always have Paris.

1362
01:37:06,502 --> 01:37:09,494
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1363
01:37:09,905 --> 01:37:11,566
We got it back last night.

1364
01:37:12,474 --> 01:37:16,240
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1365
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:18,235
But I' ve got a job to do too.

1366
01:37:18,447 --> 01:37:22,178
Where I' m going, you can't follow.
What I' ve got to do you can't be any part of.

1367
01:37:22,784 --> 01:37:24,308
Ilsa, I' m no good at being noble.

1368
01:37:24,486 --> 01:37:27,944
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1369
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:30,819
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1370
01:37:30,993 --> 01:37:33,518
Someday you'll understand that.

1371
01:37:34,696 --> 01:37:36,459
Now, now.

1372
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,398
Here's looking at you, kid.

1373
01:37:55,551 --> 01:37:58,042
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1374
01:37:58,287 --> 01:38:00,414
There's something you should know.

1375
01:38:00,656 --> 01:38:02,453
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1376
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,718
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1377
01:38:05,894 --> 01:38:07,759
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1378
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:10,797
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1379
01:38:10,966 --> 01:38:14,402
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, llsa?

1380
01:38:14,836 --> 01:38:16,064
Yes.

1381
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:18,263
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1382
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,967
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1383
01:38:22,144 --> 01:38:24,669
But that was all over long ago.

1384
01:38:24,846 --> 01:38:28,111
For your sake, she pretended it wasrt,
and I let her pretend.

1385
01:38:28,617 --> 01:38:30,244
I understand.

1386
01:38:30,419 --> 01:38:32,614
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1387
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:35,119
I appreciate it.

1388
01:38:35,991 --> 01:38:37,754
Welcome back to the fight.

1389
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,485
This time I know our side will win.

1390
01:38:54,209 --> 01:38:56,370
Are you ready, llsa?

1391
01:38:58,247 --> 01:38:59,612
Yes, I' m ready.

1392
01:39:02,751 --> 01:39:04,116
Goodbye, Rick.

1393
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:06,887
God bless you.

1394
01:39:08,223 --> 01:39:10,919
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1395
01:39:28,977 --> 01:39:30,911
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1396
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:33,912
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1397
01:39:34,082 --> 01:39:35,413
What you just did for Laszlo.

1398
01:39:35,584 --> 01:39:37,984
That fairy tale you invented
to send llsa away with him.

1399
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:40,485
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1400
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:42,714
But she knew you were lying.

1401
01:39:42,891 --> 01:39:44,825
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1402
01:39:44,993 --> 01:39:49,293
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1403
01:39:49,464 --> 01:39:52,956
- I' II have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1404
01:40:00,008 --> 01:40:04,342
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1405
01:40:06,915 --> 01:40:09,008
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1406
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:11,209
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1407
01:40:13,522 --> 01:40:16,355
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1408
01:40:16,558 --> 01:40:19,823
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I' m willing to shoot you.

1409
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:23,355
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1410
01:40:23,532 --> 01:40:25,397
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1411
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:42,007
Major Strasser has been shot.

1412
01:40:46,788 --> 01:40:49,416
Round up the usual suspects.

1413
01:41:13,148 --> 01:41:16,811
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1414
01:41:16,985 --> 01:41:19,146
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1415
01:41:19,321 --> 01:41:21,551
I think perhaps you're right.

1416
01:41:46,348 --> 01:41:50,045
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1417
01:41:50,218 --> 01:41:52,652
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1418
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:56,621
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1419
01:41:56,858 --> 01:41:58,086
I could use a trip.

1420
01:41:58,293 --> 01:42:01,558
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1421
01:42:01,797 --> 01:42:04,698
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1422
01:42:04,866 --> 01:42:06,094
"Our" expenses?

1423
01:42:06,935 --> 01:42:11,133
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1424
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,749
