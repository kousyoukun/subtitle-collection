2
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:14,025
With the coming
of the Second World War...

3
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:19,030
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully or desperately...

4
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,282
... toward the freedom of the Americas.

5
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:24,118
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

6
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:27,372
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

7
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,709
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

8
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:34,837
Paris to Marseilles.

9
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:43,388
Across the Mediterranean to Oran.

10
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:54,690
Then by train or auto or foot
across the rim of Africa...

11
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:57,527
... to Casablanca in French Morocco.

12
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,365
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

13
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,160
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

14
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,579
And from Lisbon to the New World.

15
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,625
But the others wait in Casablanca.

16
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,293
And wait...

17
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,170
...and wait...

18
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,005
...and wait.

19
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,350
"To all officers:

20
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:34,439
"Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

21
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,608
"Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

22
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,821
"Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

23
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,406
"Important."

24
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,647
May we see your papers?

25
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,524
I don't have them on me.

26
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,943
In that case,
you'll have to come along.

27
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,739
It's possible that I...
Yes. Here they are.

28
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,204
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

29
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,374
Halt!

30
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,984
- What is going on?
- I don't know, my dear.

31
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,612
Pardon me. Have you not heard?

32
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,532
We hear very little
and we understand even less.

33
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:11,536
Two German couriers were found
murdered in the unoccupied desert.

34
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:14,497
This is the customary
roundup of refugees, liberals...

35
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,959
...and beautiful girls for Mr.Renault,
the prefect of police.

36
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:26,634
With these refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

37
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:29,262
Some have been waiting
years for a visa.

38
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:32,765
I beg of you, monsieur.
Watch yourself. Be on guard.

39
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:34,934
This place is full of vultures.

40
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,979
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere.

41
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,857
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

42
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,736
Amusing little fellow.

43
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,237
Waiter.

44
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,407
- How silly of me.
- What, dear?

45
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,243
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

46
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:10,053
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

47
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,165
It is good to see you,
Major Strasser.

48
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:40,500
Thank you, thank you.

49
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,669
May I present Captain Renault,
the police prefect.

50
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:47,173
Unoccupied France welcomes you.

51
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:49,300
Thank you, it's good to be here.

52
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:52,303
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

53
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:56,265
- Captain Tonelli, the Italian service...
- That is kind of you.

54
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:05,566
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

55
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,487
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

56
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,657
- But you're not referring to the weather.
- What else?

57
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,909
What's been done about the murders?

58
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,996
My men are rounding up twice
the usual number of suspects.

59
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:22,208
- But we know who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

60
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,336
Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

61
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:29,298
I've already heard about this café.
Also about Mr.Rick himself.

62
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,296
For nobody else
Gave me a thrill

63
00:07:08,546 --> 00:07:11,215
Honey, with all your faults
I love you still

64
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,885
It had to be you, wonderful you

65
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:16,012
It had to be you

66
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:20,767
'Cause my hair is curly

67
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,065
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

68
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,317
I'll never get out of here.

69
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,235
I'll die in Casablanca.

70
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,822
But can't you make it
just a little more, please?

71
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,159
Sorry, but diamonds are
a drag on the market.

72
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,953
There are diamonds everywhere.
Twenty-four hundred.

73
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,205
All right.

74
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:46,250
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

75
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,214
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

76
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,468
It leaves at one tomorrow night.
From the end of the marina.

77
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:56,594
Thank you.

78
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:59,389
And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

79
00:07:59,597 --> 00:08:01,891
Remember, in cash!

80
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,274
Cheerio.

81
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,444
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

82
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,247
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

83
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:27,041
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

84
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,337
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I've never seen it.

85
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:33,715
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

86
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:37,760
Perhaps if you told him I ran
the second-largest bank in Amsterdam.

87
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,680
The second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

88
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,267
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef here.

89
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,103
We have something to look forward to.

90
00:08:48,396 --> 00:08:50,523
And his father is the bellboy.

91
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:51,566
Good!

92
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,929
Excuse me.

93
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,476
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

94
00:09:26,684 --> 00:09:30,646
Of all the nerve! Who do you think...
I know there is gambling in there!

95
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:31,981
You dare not keep me out!

96
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:33,483
What's the trouble?

97
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,652
I have been in every gambling room
from Honolulu to Berlin.

98
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:40,782
If you think I'll be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're mistaken.

99
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:41,949
Excuse me, please.

100
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:42,992
Hello, Rick.

101
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:47,538
Your cash is good at the bar.

102
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,582
What? Do you know who I am?

103
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,876
I do. You're lucky
the bar is open to you.

104
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:55,213
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to the "Angriff"!

105
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:02,261
Watching you now, one would think
you've been doing this all your life.

106
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,181
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

107
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,560
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

108
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,230
What right do I have to think?

109
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:18,569
May I?

110
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:22,115
Too bad about those two
German couriers.

111
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:24,951
They got lucky.
Yesterday, they were just clerks.

112
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,870
Today, they're the honored dead.

113
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,457
You're a very cynical person.
Forgive me for saying so.

114
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,500
I forgive you.

115
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,585
Will you have a drink with me?

116
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:37,964
I forgot you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

117
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:40,633
You despise me, don't you?

118
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,969
If I gave you any thought,
I would.

119
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,512
But why?

120
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:48,057
You object to the kind
of business I do, huh?

121
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:52,937
But think of all those poor refugees
who must rot here if I didn't help them.

122
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:57,525
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

123
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:00,194
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

124
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:04,532
Think of the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

125
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:07,952
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

126
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:11,080
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

127
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,418
After tonight, I'll be through
with the whole business.

128
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:18,171
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

129
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,632
Who'd you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

130
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,344
Myself. I found myself
much more reasonable.

131
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:26,846
Look, Rick.

132
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,223
You know what this is?

133
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,477
Something that even you
have never seen.

134
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,772
Letters of transit
signed by General de Gaulle.

135
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,025
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

136
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,276
One moment.

137
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:44,655
Tonight, I'll be selling those for
more money than even I ever dreamed of.

138
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:46,991
And then, addio, Casablanca.

139
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:51,162
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but just because you despise me...

140
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,164
...you are the only one I trust.

141
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,124
Will you keep these for me?

142
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,002
- For how long?
- An hour. Perhaps a little longer.

143
00:11:58,211 --> 00:11:59,587
I don't want them overnight.

144
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:02,840
Don't be afraid of that.
Please keep them for me.

145
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,176
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

146
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:07,720
Waiter,
I'll be expecting some people.

147
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,516
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

148
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,975
Rick...

149
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,895
...I hope you're more
impressed with me now.

150
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:19,482
I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

151
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,275
Just a moment.

152
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:28,199
I heard a rumor those German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

153
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,161
I've heard that rumor too.

154
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,914
- Poor devils.
- You're right, Ugarte.

155
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:38,626
I am a little more impressed with you.

156
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,888
- Say, who's got trouble?
- We got trouble

157
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,974
- How much trouble?
- Too much trouble

158
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:57,645
Well now, don't you frown
Just knuckle down and knock on wood

159
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,399
- Who's unhappy?
- We're unhappy

160
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:04,360
- How unhappy?
- Too unhappy

161
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:08,197
That won't do
When you are blue, just knock on wood

162
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,412
- How unlucky?
- Too unlucky

163
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:18,750
But your luck'll change
If you'll arrange to knock on wood

164
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:22,545
- Who's got nothing?
- We got nothing

165
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:44,358
- Now who's lucky?
- We're all lucky

166
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,486
- Just how lucky?
- Very lucky

167
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:49,238
Well, smile up, then
And once again

168
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:52,533
Let's knock on wood

169
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:00,792
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

170
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:02,251
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

171
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:05,380
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

172
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,549
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

173
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,261
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

174
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,639
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

175
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,810
In refugees alone, we can make
a fortune together in the black market.

176
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:21,604
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

177
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,732
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

178
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:25,817
Suppose we do.

179
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:31,280
When will you realize that in this world
isolationism is not a practical policy?

180
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,866
Ferrari wants you to work
for him at the Blue Parrot.

181
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,284
I like it fine here.

182
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:39,330
- He'll double what I pay you.
- But I ain't got time to spend money.

183
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:40,873
Sorry.

184
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:48,506
The boss's private stock.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

185
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:49,549
Shut up.

186
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:54,387
All right. For you, I shut up.
Because, Yvonne, I love you.

187
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,141
Monsieur Rick.

188
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:01,686
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

189
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:07,525
Where were you last night?

190
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,236
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

191
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:14,198
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

192
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,409
Give me another.

193
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:19,245
- She's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

194
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:21,664
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

195
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,417
- I'm tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

196
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,669
- We'll get your coat.
- Take your hands off!

197
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:29,589
You're going home.
You've had too much to drink.

198
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,801
Hey, taxi!

199
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:36,679
Who do you think you are,
pushing me?

200
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:38,639
What a fool I was
to fall for you.

201
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,225
- Go with her. Be sure she gets home.
- Yes, boss.

202
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:42,268
Come right back.

203
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:44,020
Yes, boss.

204
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,408
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

205
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,702
How extravagant,
throwing away women like that.

206
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,788
Someday, they may be scarce.

207
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,958
I think I shall pay a call on Yvonne.
Maybe get her on the rebound.

208
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,544
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

209
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:21,974
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

210
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,647
The plane to Lisbon.

211
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,028
You would like to be on it?

212
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:35,863
Why? What's in Lisbon?

213
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:38,074
The clipper to America.

214
00:16:38,324 --> 00:16:41,035
I've speculated on why
you don't return to America.

215
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:45,373
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Run off with a senator's wife?

216
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:48,292
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

217
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,169
It's a combination of all three.

218
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,088
What brought you to Casablanca?

219
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:55,508
My health. I came
to Casablanca for the waters.

220
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:59,262
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

221
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,305
I was misinformed.

222
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:04,934
Excuse me, Rick.

223
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:08,354
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

224
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,982
...and the cashier
would like some money.

225
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:15,236
- I'll get it from the safe.
- I'm so upset. You know...

226
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,031
Forget it, Emil.
Mistakes happen all the time.

227
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:19,949
I'm awfully sorry.

228
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:28,875
There'll be some excitement tonight.
An arrest in your café.

229
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,085
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

230
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,712
A murderer, no less.

231
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:36,924
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't. He cannot escape.

232
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:41,220
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

233
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,893
We could've arrested him
at the Blue Parrot.

234
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,395
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

235
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,064
It will amuse your customers.

236
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:53,775
Our entertainment's enough.

237
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:59,364
We'll have an important guest tonight.
Major Strasser, of the Third Reich.

238
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:03,993
We want him to see the arrest as a
demonstration of our efficiency.

239
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,245
I see.
What's Strasser doing here?

240
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:10,249
He didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

241
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,667
- Perhaps not.
- Here you are.

242
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:13,961
- It won't happen again.
- That's all right.

243
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,048
Louis, there's something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it?

244
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,674
How observant you are.

245
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:21,594
I wanted to give you
a word of advice.

246
00:18:21,844 --> 00:18:23,012
Yeah?

247
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,515
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

248
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:30,895
There are exit visas sold in this café,
but we know you've never sold one.

249
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,231
That's why we let you remain open.

250
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,483
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

251
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,318
That is another reason.

252
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,238
There's a man arrived here
on his way to America.

253
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:43,324
He'll offer a fortune to anyone
who'll get him a visa.

254
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,077
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

255
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:47,704
Victor Laszlo?

256
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:50,248
That's the first time
I've seen you impressed.

257
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:52,625
He's succeeded
in impressing half the world.

258
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,211
It's my duty to see
he doesn't impress the other half.

259
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:59,590
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

260
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,759
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

261
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:03,094
Manages what?

262
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,137
His escape.

263
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:06,139
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

264
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,892
He escaped the concentration camp.
Nazis have chased him through Europe.

265
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:11,561
This is the end of the chase.

266
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:15,690
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
- Is that a serious offer?

267
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:18,401
I just paid 20.
I'd like to get it back.

268
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:21,362
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor, corrupt official.

269
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:23,406
- Okay.
- Done.

270
00:19:23,656 --> 00:19:27,660
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs a visa. Or, I should say, two.

271
00:19:28,077 --> 00:19:30,079
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

272
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,957
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen her.

273
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,127
If he did not leave her
in Marseilles or in Oran...

274
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:38,463
...he won't leave her in Casablanca.

275
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,798
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you.

276
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,218
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

277
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,556
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

278
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:51,851
Because I suspect
that under that cynical shell...

279
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,853
...you're at heart
a sentimentalist.

280
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,523
Laugh if you will.
I'm familiar with your record.

281
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,942
Let me point out just two items.

282
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:03,863
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

283
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:08,201
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the loyalist side.

284
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,745
And got well paid on both occasions.

285
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:13,206
The winning side
would've paid much better.

286
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:14,707
Maybe.

287
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,877
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

288
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,921
I have my orders.

289
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,507
I see. Gestapo spank.

290
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:25,510
You overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

291
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,097
I don't interfere with them
and they don't interfere with me.

292
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,307
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

293
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,726
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

294
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:36,312
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

295
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:49,283
Carl, see that the major gets
a good table, close to the ladies.

296
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:54,163
I've already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

297
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,502
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

298
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,467
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

299
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,016
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

300
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,436
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

301
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:19,230
It's a pleasure to have you here.

302
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,065
Champagne and a tin of caviar.

303
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:24,819
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26?
A good French wine.

304
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:26,654
Very well, sir.

305
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,450
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight.

306
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,995
You'll see the arrest of the man
who murdered your couriers.

307
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:35,913
I expected no less, captain.

308
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:37,749
Monsieur Ugarte.

309
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:43,963
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

310
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,299
May I first cash my chips?

311
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,184
Very lucky.
Two thousand, please.

312
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:58,603
Two thousand.

313
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:04,817
Thank you.

314
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:19,999
Rick, help me!

315
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:24,545
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- Rick, hide me! You must help me!

316
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:25,880
Do something!

317
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,382
Rick!

318
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:33,262
Excellent, captain.

319
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,973
When they come to get me,
I hope you'll be more help.

320
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,434
I stick my neck out for nobody.

321
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:42,438
I'm sorry there was a disturbance,
folks, but it's all over now.

322
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,401
Sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

323
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:57,412
This is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

324
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,455
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

325
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:01,791
You know Herr Heinz
of the Third Reich.

326
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,043
Please join us, Mr.Rick.

327
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,590
We are very honored tonight.

328
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,720
Major Strasser is one reason
the Third Reich enjoys its reputation.

329
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:16,931
You say "Third Reich" as though
you expect there to be others.

330
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,101
Personally, major,
I will take what comes.

331
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,104
Do you mind if I ask
a few questions?

332
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:25,690
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

333
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,568
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

334
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:32,238
That makes Rick
a citizen of the world.

335
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:35,074
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you.

336
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:38,703
I understand you came here from Paris
during the occupation.

337
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,788
There seems to be no secret about that.

338
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,084
Are you one of those who can't imagine
Germans in their beloved Paris?

339
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,503
It's not particularly
my beloved Paris.

340
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,505
Can you imagine us in London?

341
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:52,216
When you get there, ask me.

342
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,178
- Diplomatist!
- How about New York?

343
00:23:55,428 --> 00:24:00,308
There are sections of New York that
I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

344
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:03,603
- Who will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

345
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:06,731
Rick is neutral about everything.
And that takes in...

346
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,483
...the field of women too.

347
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,818
You weren't always
so carefully neutral.

348
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:13,696
We have a complete dossier on you.

349
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:19,577
"Richard Blaine, American. Age, 37.
Cannot return to his country."

350
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:22,497
The reason is vague.
We know what you did in Paris...

351
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:26,584
...and why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we won't broadcast it.

352
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,169
Are my eyes really brown?

353
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:30,171
You will forgive my curiosity.

354
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:33,549
The point is, an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

355
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,011
...and we are checking up on anyone
who can be of any help.

356
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:41,265
My interest in whether Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

357
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:45,186
In this case, you have
no sympathy for the fox?

358
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:48,815
Not particularly. I understand
the hound's point of view too.

359
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,778
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the
Prague newspapers till we marched in.

360
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:58,366
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in a cellar.

361
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:01,327
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

362
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:04,414
He's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

363
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:08,668
In Paris, he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

364
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:12,296
Excuse me. Your business is
politics, mine is running a saloon.

365
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,382
Good evening, Mr.Blaine.

366
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,136
You see, major? You have
nothing to worry about Rick.

367
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,262
Perhaps.

368
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,225
Yes, monsieur?

369
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:28,980
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, monsieur. Right this way.

370
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:57,300
Two Cointreaux, please.

371
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,846
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

372
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:05,141
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

373
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:08,227
If we'd walk out so soon
it'd only call attention to us.

374
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:10,396
Perhaps he's in some
other part of the café.

375
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,235
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

376
00:26:16,527 --> 00:26:20,782
You'll find a market for this ring.
I must sell it at a great sacrifice.

377
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:23,451
- Thank you, but I don't...
- Perhaps for the lady.

378
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,036
The ring is quite unique.

379
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,415
Yes, I'm very interested.

380
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:30,875
Good.

381
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:32,502
Your name?

382
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,962
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service.

383
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:38,758
I'll meet you at the bar later.

384
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:41,427
We don't want the ring,
but thank you for showing it to us.

385
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:44,764
- Such a bargain. That is your decision?
- It is.

386
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:49,727
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes.

387
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:51,979
Captain Renault, prefect of police.

388
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:53,231
What do you want?

389
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,526
To welcome you to Casablanca
and to wish you a pleasant stay.

390
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:59,487
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

391
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:02,073
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

392
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,827
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

393
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:07,954
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?

394
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:12,500
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman to visit Casablanca.

395
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,544
That was a gross understatement.

396
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,045
You're very kind.

397
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:18,923
- Won't you join us?
- If you'll permit me.

398
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:22,885
Emil, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. Put it on my bill.

399
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:28,433
It's a game we play. They put it on the
bill, I tear it up. Very convenient.

400
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,145
Captain, the boy
who's playing the piano...

401
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:34,230
Somewhere I've seen him.

402
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,857
- Sam?
- Yes.

403
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:38,067
He came from Paris with Rick.

404
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:39,360
Rick? Who's he?

405
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,072
- You are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

406
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:46,534
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man...
If I were a woman...

407
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:49,454
...and I weren't around,
I'd be in love with Rick.

408
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:53,750
But what a fool I am talking to
a beautiful woman about another man.

409
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:55,585
Excuse me.

410
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:57,253
Major.

411
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,216
Mademoiselle and monsieur,
may I present Major Strasser?

412
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,342
How do you do?

413
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,762
This is a pleasure
I've looked forward to.

414
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,514
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

415
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,808
But you see,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

416
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:15,605
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you're a subject of the German Reich.

417
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:19,650
I've never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

418
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:23,571
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

419
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,490
This is hardly the time or the place.

420
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:30,119
Then we'll state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

421
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,454
With mademoiselle.

422
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:36,167
Captain Renault,
I am under your authority.

423
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:38,378
Is it your order
we come to your office?

424
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:42,507
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

425
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:44,050
Very well.

426
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:51,307
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

427
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:55,561
- This time, they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

428
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,773
We've been in difficult
places before, haven't we?

429
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:33,891
I must find out what Berger knows.

430
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,353
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

431
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:57,874
Mr.Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

432
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,043
Champagne cocktail, please.

433
00:30:00,877 --> 00:30:03,421
I recognize you
from the news photographs.

434
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,966
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

435
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:09,886
I read five times
that you were killed in five places.

436
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,889
As you see, it was true
every single time.

437
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,474
Thank heaven I found you.

438
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:18,436
I'm looking for a man named Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

439
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:21,189
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

440
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,691
He's under arrest for murder.

441
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:25,777
He was arrested here tonight.

442
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,445
I see.

443
00:30:28,112 --> 00:30:31,824
But we, who are still free, will do
all we can. We are organized.

444
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,369
Underground, like everywhere else.

445
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:37,413
Tomorrow night, there is a meeting
at the Café du Roi.

446
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:39,415
If you'll come...

447
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,348
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

448
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,225
Very well, mademoiselle.

449
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:03,022
- How's the jewelry business?
- Not so good. Check, please.

450
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:07,485
Too bad you weren't here earlier.
We had quite a bit of excitement, right?

451
00:31:07,735 --> 00:31:08,903
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

452
00:31:09,153 --> 00:31:12,240
- My bill.
- No. Two champagnes. Please.

453
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,741
Yes, sir.

454
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:19,747
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

455
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:22,458
I never expected to see you again.

456
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:24,794
It's been a long time.

457
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:28,506
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

458
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,802
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

459
00:31:42,937 --> 00:31:43,813
Where is Rick?

460
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,899
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

461
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:48,985
When will he be back?

462
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:51,362
Not tonight no more.
He ain't coming...

463
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,031
He went home.

464
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,325
Does he always leave so early?

465
00:31:56,534 --> 00:32:00,163
Oh, he never...
He's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot.

466
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,540
Goes up there all the time.

467
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,836
You used to be
a much better liar, Sam.

468
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:10,965
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

469
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,679
Play it once, Sam.
For old time's sake.

470
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,474
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.

471
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,642
Play it, Sam.

472
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,562
Play "As Time Goes By."

473
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:27,940
I can't remember it.
I'm a little rusty on it.

474
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:30,902
I'll hum it for you.

475
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:43,790
Sing it, Sam.

476
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,878
You must remember this

477
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:51,714
A kiss is just a kiss

478
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:56,386
A sigh is just a sigh

479
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:02,642
The fundamental things apply

480
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,771
As time goes by

481
00:33:10,066 --> 00:33:12,652
And when two lovers woo

482
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:15,655
They still say, "I love you"

483
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:18,116
On that you can rely

484
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:26,082
No matter what the future brings

485
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,293
As time goes by

486
00:33:30,128 --> 00:33:32,797
Sam, I thought I told you
never to play...

487
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:46,436
You were asking about Rick
and here he is. May I present...

488
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:48,980
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

489
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,650
You've already met Rick?
Then perhaps you also...

490
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,235
This is Mr.Laszlo.

491
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:55,737
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

492
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,281
One hears a great deal
about Rick in Casablanca.

493
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,408
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

494
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,577
- Join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

495
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:03,619
Thanks, I will.

496
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,540
Well! A precedent
is being broken. Emil?

497
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:10,793
A very interesting café.
I congratulate you.

498
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,628
- I congratulate you.
- What for?

499
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:13,796
Your work.

500
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:15,673
Thank you. I try.

501
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:18,509
We all try. You succeed.

502
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:21,137
She was asking about you earlier...

503
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:24,182
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

504
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,933
I wasn't sure you were the same.

505
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,604
- The last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

506
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,107
How nice. You remembered.

507
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,027
That was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

508
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,404
Not an easy day to forget.

509
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,909
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

510
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,954
Yes. I put that dress away.

511
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:49,457
When the Germans march out,
I'll wear it again.

512
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:53,878
You're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

513
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:57,465
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

514
00:34:57,715 --> 00:35:00,259
So it is. We have a curfew
here in Casablanca.

515
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:03,930
It wouldn't do for the chief of police
to be drinking after hours.

516
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:07,058
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.

517
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,935
- Your check, sir.
- My party.

518
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:12,689
Another precedent gone. This has been
a very interesting evening.

519
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:16,776
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night...

520
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:18,736
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

521
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:20,988
- Say good night to Sam.
- I will.

522
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:26,077
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

523
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:28,955
He hasn't played it in a long time.

524
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:31,290
Good night.

525
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,084
Good night.

526
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,679
A very puzzling fellow.
What sort is he?

527
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:48,057
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

528
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,977
- Tomorrow at 10 at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

529
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:52,228
Good night.

530
00:36:31,684 --> 00:36:32,894
Boss?

531
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:38,733
- Boss?
- Yeah?

532
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:42,236
- Ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

533
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:45,448
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

534
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:47,784
- You ever going to bed?
- No!

535
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:50,370
I ain't sleepy either.

536
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:51,746
Then have a drink.

537
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,790
- Not me.
- Well, don't have a drink.

538
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,458
Let's get out of here.

539
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,169
No, sir.
I'm waiting for a lady.

540
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,963
Let's go. Ain't nothing
but trouble for you here.

541
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,049
I know she's coming back.

542
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:05,051
We'll drive all night.

543
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,929
We'll get drunk
and stay away till she's gone.

544
00:37:08,179 --> 00:37:10,014
Shut up and go home, will you?

545
00:37:10,264 --> 00:37:13,142
No, sir. I'm staying right here.

546
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:21,275
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

547
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:24,821
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

548
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:28,199
- Sam.
- Yes, boss.

549
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:32,662
If it's December, 1941, in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

550
00:37:33,204 --> 00:37:34,288
What...?

551
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:36,082
My watch stopped.

552
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,127
I bet they're asleep in New York.

553
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:42,088
I bet they're asleep all over America.

554
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:52,348
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

555
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:55,309
...she walks into mine.

556
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:05,194
- What are you playing?
- A little something of my own.

557
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:08,156
- Stop it. You know what I wanna hear.
- I don't.

558
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:10,783
You played it for her,
you can play it for me.

559
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:14,162
- I don't remember...
- If she can stand it, I can.

560
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:15,705
Play it!

561
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:17,915
Yes, boss.

562
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:50,425
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

563
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,802
What did you do
and what did you think?

564
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:55,263
We said no questions.

565
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:02,061
Here's looking at you, kid.

566
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:37,638
A franc for your thoughts.

567
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:40,266
In America they'd bring only a penny.

568
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,685
I guess that's about
all they're worth.

569
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,272
I'm willing to be overcharged.

570
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:47,523
Tell me.

571
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:49,942
Well, I was wondering...

572
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:56,074
...why I'm so lucky, why I should
find you waiting for me to come along?

573
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:59,452
Why there is no other man in my life?

574
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:04,082
That's easy. There was.

575
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,627
He's dead.

576
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:10,463
I'm sorry for asking.

577
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,508
I forgot we said no questions.

578
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:21,182
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

579
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,022
Nothing can stop them now.
Wednesday they'll be in Paris.

580
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:12,316
They'll find out your record.
It won't be safe here.

581
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,736
I'm on their blacklist already.

582
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:16,779
Their "roll of honor."

583
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:25,204
Hearts full of passion

584
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:27,999
Jealousy and hate

585
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,585
Woman needs man

586
00:42:30,835 --> 00:42:33,463
And man must have his mate

587
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,092
That no one can deny

588
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,971
It's still the same old story

589
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:44,515
A fight for love and glory

590
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:48,478
A case of do or die

591
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:55,443
The world will always welcome lovers

592
00:42:56,361 --> 00:43:01,157
As time goes by

593
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:03,910
Henri wants us
to finish three more bottles.

594
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,247
He'll water his garden with champagne
before he lets the Germans drink it.

595
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:11,751
This ought to take the sting
out of being occupied.

596
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:13,211
You said it.

597
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:15,588
Here's looking at you, kid.

598
00:43:42,865 --> 00:43:44,659
My German's a little rusty.

599
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:47,578
It's the Gestapo.

600
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:52,250
They say they expect
to be in Paris tomorrow.

601
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:56,963
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

602
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:03,177
With the world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

603
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:05,138
Yeah, it's pretty bad timing.

604
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:07,223
Where were you 10 years ago?

605
00:44:07,515 --> 00:44:08,933
Ten years ago?

606
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:11,978
Let's see...

607
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:16,107
Yes, I was having a brace
put on my teeth. Where were you?

608
00:44:16,774 --> 00:44:18,568
Looking for a job.

609
00:44:24,907 --> 00:44:26,534
Was that cannon fire?

610
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:28,911
Or my heart pounding?

611
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:34,208
It's the German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

612
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:37,712
And getting closer every minute.

613
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:42,508
Here, here, drink up.
We'll never finish the other three.

614
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:46,804
Germans will be here pretty soon
and they'll come looking for you.

615
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:48,389
There's a price on your head.

616
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,684
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

617
00:44:52,185 --> 00:44:53,478
It's strange.

618
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,230
I know so very little about you.

619
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:58,024
I know little about you.

620
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:00,902
Except that you had
your teeth straightened.

621
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:04,697
Be serious. You're in danger.
You must leave Paris.

622
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,157
No, we must leave.

623
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:08,576
Yes, of course. We.

624
00:45:08,826 --> 00:45:13,206
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

625
00:45:13,998 --> 00:45:15,750
Not at my hotel. I...

626
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:19,504
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

627
00:45:20,129 --> 00:45:21,714
I'll meet you at the station.

628
00:45:21,964 --> 00:45:24,050
All right, at a quarter to 5.

629
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,094
Why don't we marry
in Marseilles?

630
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:32,517
That's too far ahead to plan.

631
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:35,144
I guess it is a little too far ahead.

632
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:39,065
What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

633
00:45:39,816 --> 00:45:44,070
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

634
00:45:45,822 --> 00:45:46,906
What's wrong, kid?

635
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:55,540
I love you so much.

636
00:45:57,917 --> 00:46:00,378
And I hate this war so much.

637
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,550
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

638
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:08,761
If you shouldn't get away...

639
00:46:10,513 --> 00:46:12,849
If something should keep us apart...

640
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:15,393
...wherever they put you...

641
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:19,063
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

642
00:46:24,652 --> 00:46:25,945
Kiss me.

643
00:46:26,362 --> 00:46:28,906
Kiss me as if it were
the last time.

644
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:57,852
All aboard! The last train
leaving in three minutes.

645
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:06,486
Have you seen her?

646
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:09,489
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

647
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,116
But this note came
just after you left.

648
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:28,633
That's the last call,
Mr.Richard.

649
00:47:29,258 --> 00:47:30,885
Do you hear me?

650
00:47:31,344 --> 00:47:34,806
Come on, Mr.Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

651
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,192
Rick, I have to talk to you.

652
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:32,739
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

653
00:48:33,364 --> 00:48:36,743
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

654
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:40,913
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

655
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:44,000
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known that you were here.

656
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:45,918
Believe me, it's true.
I didn't know.

657
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:49,630
It's funny how your voice hasn't
changed. I can still hear it.

658
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,216
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

659
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:56,054
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

660
00:48:56,679 --> 00:48:59,057
I can understand how you feel.

661
00:48:59,515 --> 00:49:01,684
You understand how I feel?

662
00:49:02,435 --> 00:49:04,187
How long was it we had, honey?

663
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:07,023
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

664
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,108
Every one of them.

665
00:49:09,776 --> 00:49:12,195
Mostly, I remember the last one.

666
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:16,157
The "wow" finish. A guy standing
on a platform in the rain...

667
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:20,953
...with a comical look on his face
from his insides having been kicked out.

668
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:24,665
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

669
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,584
Has it got a "wow" finish?

670
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:29,545
I don't know the finish yet.

671
00:49:29,754 --> 00:49:32,924
Go on, tell it. Maybe one will
come to you as you go along.

672
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:39,514
It's about a girl who'd just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

673
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:41,432
At the house of some friends...

674
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:44,352
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

675
00:49:44,602 --> 00:49:47,021
A very great and courageous man.

676
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:53,236
He opened up for her a beautiful world
full of knowledge, thoughts and ideals.

677
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:57,031
Everything she knew or ever became
was because of him.

678
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,202
She looked up to him
and worshiped him...

679
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:03,871
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

680
00:50:04,372 --> 00:50:06,457
Yes, that's very pretty.

681
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:09,919
I heard a story once.
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

682
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:13,089
They went along with
the sound of a tinny piano...

683
00:50:13,297 --> 00:50:15,508
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

684
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:21,014
"Mister, I met a man once when
I was a kid," they'd always begin.

685
00:50:23,683 --> 00:50:27,061
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

686
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,354
Tell me...

687
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,607
...who was it you left me for?

688
00:50:31,816 --> 00:50:34,402
Was it Laszlo, or were there
others in between...

689
00:50:35,403 --> 00:50:37,488
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

690
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:06,267
I suspect Ugarte left
the letters of transit with Mr.Blaine.

691
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:09,020
I suggest you search
the café immediately.

692
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:12,190
If Rick has them, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

693
00:51:12,398 --> 00:51:14,275
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

694
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:17,320
My impression was that he's just
another blundering American.

695
00:51:17,528 --> 00:51:19,655
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

696
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:23,159
I was with them when they
blundered into Berlin in 1918.

697
00:51:23,826 --> 00:51:26,537
As to Laszlo, we want him watched
24 hours a day.

698
00:51:26,746 --> 00:51:30,583
It may interest you to know that
at this moment he's on his way here.

699
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:38,299
There's nothing we can do.

700
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:42,095
I'm delighted to see you both.
Did you rest well?

701
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:43,137
I slept well.

702
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:46,933
That's strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

703
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:50,687
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Sit down.

704
00:51:53,272 --> 00:51:56,609
We won't mince words. You're
an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

705
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:59,487
So far, you've been
fortunate enough in eluding us.

706
00:51:59,737 --> 00:52:01,280
You have reached Casablanca.

707
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,200
It is my duty to see
that you stay here.

708
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:06,411
Whether or not you'll
succeed is problematic.

709
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:09,372
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

710
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,208
Is it possible Herr Laszlo
will receive a visa?

711
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,711
I'm afraid not.
My regrets, monsieur.

712
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:17,422
Well, perhaps
I shall like it in Casablanca.

713
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:19,173
And mademoiselle?

714
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:23,010
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

715
00:52:23,261 --> 00:52:26,097
Don't be in a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

716
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:28,850
You may be in
Casablanca indefinitely.

717
00:52:29,308 --> 00:52:32,353
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.
On one condition.

718
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:33,396
And that is?

719
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,025
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

720
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:40,903
...in Brussels, in Amsterdam,
in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens...

721
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:43,656
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

722
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:48,369
If you'll furnish me with their names
and whereabouts, you'll have your visa.

723
00:52:48,703 --> 00:52:51,831
And the honor of having
served the Third Reich.

724
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,542
I was in a German
concentration camp for a year.

725
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:56,252
That's honor enough for a lifetime.

726
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,171
You'll give us the names?

727
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:02,258
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

728
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:05,470
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

729
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,264
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

730
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:11,059
What if you track them down
and kill them?

731
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:12,852
What if you murdered us all?

732
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:17,273
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

733
00:53:17,523 --> 00:53:19,776
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

734
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:23,529
You have a reputation for eloquence,
which I can now understand.

735
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,198
But you're mistaken.

736
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:28,034
You said enemies of the Reich
could be replaced.

737
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:29,744
There is one exception.

738
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:32,372
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

739
00:53:32,622 --> 00:53:35,541
...should occur to you
while you're trying to escape.

740
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:38,127
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

741
00:53:38,378 --> 00:53:40,046
This is still unoccupied France.

742
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:43,091
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on the captain.

743
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:46,052
- Insofar as it is in my power...
- Thank you.

744
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:50,598
By the way, last night you evinced
an interest in Señor Ugarte.

745
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,058
Yes.

746
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:53,851
You have a message for him.

747
00:53:55,186 --> 00:53:57,438
Nothing important.
May I speak to him now?

748
00:53:58,189 --> 00:54:00,942
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

749
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:02,985
Señor Ugarte is dead.

750
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,035
I'm making the report.

751
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:14,414
We haven't quite decided whether
he committed suicide...

752
00:54:14,664 --> 00:54:16,374
...or died trying to escape.

753
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:20,878
- Are you finished with us?
- For the time being.

754
00:54:21,087 --> 00:54:22,296
Good day.

755
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:29,512
Their next step
will be to the black market.

756
00:54:29,762 --> 00:54:30,847
Excuse me, captain.

757
00:54:31,055 --> 00:54:33,558
Another visa
problem has come up.

758
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:36,060
Show her in.

759
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:48,990
Sorry, we wouldn't be able
to handle the police.

760
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,743
- This is a job for Señor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

761
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:54,328
It can be most helpful
to know Ferrari.

762
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:57,165
He has a monopoly
on the black market here.

763
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:59,333
You'll find him at the Blue Parrot.

764
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:01,502
Thanks.

765
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:15,141
Don't be too downhearted.

766
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,186
Perhaps you can come to terms
with Captain Renault.

767
00:55:18,936 --> 00:55:21,147
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

768
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:23,816
I see the bus is in.
I'll take my shipment.

769
00:55:24,025 --> 00:55:26,736
- No hurry. Have a drink.
- I never drink in the morning.

770
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:30,323
Every time you send my shipment,
it's always a bit short.

771
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:32,575
Carrying charges, my boy.

772
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,118
Here, sit down.

773
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:36,871
There's something
I want to talk over with you.

774
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,750
The news about Ugarte upsets me.

775
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,087
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier than I do.

776
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:45,129
Of course not.

777
00:55:45,338 --> 00:55:49,425
What upsets me is that he's dead and
no one knows where those letters are.

778
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:50,760
Practically no one.

779
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,471
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

780
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:55,765
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

781
00:55:55,973 --> 00:55:58,017
I've a proposition
for whoever has them.

782
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,686
I'll handle the transaction.

783
00:55:59,936 --> 00:56:02,814
Get rid of the letters, take
all the risk, for a small fee.

784
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:04,524
And the carrying charges?

785
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:07,610
Naturally, there will be
a few incidental expenses.

786
00:56:08,236 --> 00:56:10,530
That's my proposition
for whoever has the letters.

787
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:12,240
I'll tell him when he comes in.

788
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,243
I'll put my cards out.
I think you know where they are.

789
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:19,205
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

790
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:27,422
I came over here to give them
a chance to ransack my place.

791
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,925
Don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

792
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:33,386
Excuse me,
I'll be getting back.

793
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:40,560
- Good morning.
- Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

794
00:56:44,939 --> 00:56:47,692
You won't find a treasure
like this in all Morocco.

795
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,193
Only 700 francs.

796
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:51,195
You're being cheated.

797
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:52,697
It doesn't matter, thank you.

798
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:55,867
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

799
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:58,745
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

800
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:02,165
I'm sorry I was in no condition
to receive you last night.

801
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:03,291
It doesn't matter.

802
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:06,127
Special friends of Rick's
get a special discount.

803
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:07,462
One hundred francs.

804
00:57:07,712 --> 00:57:10,840
Your story had me confused,
or maybe it was the bourbon.

805
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,383
I have some tablecloths...

806
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:15,386
- I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

807
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:19,515
Did you come back to tell me
why you ran out on me at the station?

808
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:20,558
Yes.

809
00:57:20,767 --> 00:57:23,186
You can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

810
00:57:23,394 --> 00:57:24,771
I don't think I will.

811
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:29,150
Why not? I got stuck with the
railway ticket. I'm entitled to know.

812
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:31,819
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

813
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:35,656
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him. He'd understand.

814
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:38,493
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

815
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:42,872
I'll be leaving soon and
we'll never see each other again.

816
00:57:44,123 --> 00:57:47,710
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

817
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:52,715
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days, and not Casablanca.

818
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:54,926
Not last night.

819
00:57:55,426 --> 00:57:58,596
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it'd be like?

820
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:01,724
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

821
00:58:01,974 --> 00:58:03,601
Believe that if you want to.

822
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,521
I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

823
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:08,606
Above a saloon, it's true, but...

824
00:58:08,815 --> 00:58:11,901
Walk up a flight.
I'll be expecting you.

825
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:16,906
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

826
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:18,574
You'll be there.

827
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:21,911
No, Rick.

828
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:25,665
No. You see,
Victor Laszlo is my husband.

829
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:29,419
And was, even when
I knew you in Paris.

830
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,594
I was just telling Laszlo that,
unfortunately, I'm not able to help him.

831
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:40,888
The word has gone around.

832
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:45,476
As leader of all illegal activities,
I'm an influential and respected man.

833
00:58:46,561 --> 00:58:49,272
But it'd not be worth my life
to do anything for Laszlo.

834
00:58:49,522 --> 00:58:51,357
You, however, are a different matter.

835
00:58:51,607 --> 00:58:56,112
Señor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

836
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:59,657
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

837
00:58:59,866 --> 00:59:02,952
I'll stay and keep trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

838
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:04,871
Might as well be frank.

839
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,708
It'd take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

840
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,002
We're only interested in two visas.

841
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:13,588
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

842
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:16,007
You two will want to discuss this.

843
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:18,634
Excuse me.
I'll be at the bar.

844
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:23,848
No, I won't let you stay here.

845
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:27,352
You must get to America.
Somehow I'll get out and join you.

846
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,437
If the situation were different...

847
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:32,190
...if I had to stay and there was
only one visa...

848
00:59:32,398 --> 00:59:33,566
...would you take it?

849
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:35,860
Yes, I would.

850
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,863
Yes, I see.

851
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:41,532
When I had trouble
getting out of Lille...

852
00:59:41,741 --> 00:59:43,242
...why didn't you leave me?

853
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:47,789
When I was sick in Marseilles
for two weeks and you were in danger...

854
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:49,582
...why didn't you leave me?

855
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,378
I meant to.
Something always held me up.

856
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:57,340
I love you very much.

857
00:59:58,549 --> 01:00:00,968
Your secret will be safe with me.

858
01:00:01,844 --> 01:00:03,805
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

859
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:06,182
Not more than 50 francs.

860
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,772
We've decided, Señor Ferrari.

861
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:16,609
For the present we're looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

862
01:00:16,818 --> 01:00:18,528
Good luck, but be careful.

863
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:21,531
- You know you're being shadowed?
- It becomes instinct.

864
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:24,909
I observe that you, in one respect,
are very fortunate.

865
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:27,787
I'll make one suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

866
01:00:28,037 --> 01:00:30,039
It cannot possibly profit me.

867
01:00:30,248 --> 01:00:32,542
Have you heard
about the letters of transit?

868
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:34,377
Yes, something.

869
01:00:34,627 --> 01:00:37,463
They were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

870
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:39,966
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

871
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:43,261
But my guess is Ugarte left
those letters with Rick.

872
01:00:45,263 --> 01:00:48,266
He's a difficult man.
One never knows what he'll do, or why.

873
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:50,226
But it is worth a chance.

874
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:53,312
Thank you very much.
Good day.

875
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:55,565
Bye. Thank you for your coffee.

876
01:00:55,773 --> 01:00:57,525
I shall miss that when we leave.

877
01:00:57,775 --> 01:01:00,445
It was gracious of you
to share it with me.

878
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:02,905
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

879
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,375
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

880
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:16,461
- I'd better be going.
- Check, please.

881
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:20,423
I have to warn you. This is
a dangerous place, full of vultures.

882
01:01:20,673 --> 01:01:23,384
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

883
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:26,679
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry.

884
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:47,116
You are getting to be
your best customer.

885
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:51,079
Well, drinking!
I'm very pleased with you.

886
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,081
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

887
01:01:53,331 --> 01:01:55,500
That's some going-over
your men gave my place.

888
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,794
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

889
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:00,004
I told Strasser
he wouldn't find the letters.

890
01:02:00,213 --> 01:02:02,340
But I told my men to be
especially destructive.

891
01:02:02,548 --> 01:02:05,468
You know how that impresses Germans.

892
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:08,429
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

893
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,140
Louis, are you pro-Vichy
or Free French?

894
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:15,478
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

895
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,772
It looks like you're a little late.

896
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:27,532
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

897
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,744
Who knows? In her own way, she may
constitute an entire second front.

898
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:35,498
It's time for me to flatter Strasser.
I'll see you later.

899
01:02:36,165 --> 01:02:37,625
Sascha!

900
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:38,751
French '75.

901
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:40,545
Put up the whole row of those.

902
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,839
Starting here and ending here.

903
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:45,341
We will begin with two.

904
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:55,601
What did you say?
Would you repeat it?

905
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:57,437
What I said is
not your business.

906
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:59,105
I'll make it my business.

907
01:03:05,403 --> 01:03:09,073
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Lay off politics or get out.

908
01:03:13,453 --> 01:03:14,996
You see, captain?

909
01:03:15,204 --> 01:03:17,248
The situation is not under control.

910
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:19,709
We're trying to cooperate
with your government.

911
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:21,878
We can't regulate
our people's feelings.

912
01:03:22,128 --> 01:03:24,547
Are you certain which side you're on?

913
01:03:24,922 --> 01:03:26,883
I have no conviction.

914
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:28,343
I blow with the wind...

915
01:03:28,593 --> 01:03:30,845
...and the prevailing wind
is from Vichy.

916
01:03:31,095 --> 01:03:32,889
And if it should change?

917
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:35,266
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

918
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:37,477
We're concerned about more
than Casablanca.

919
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:41,439
Every French province in Africa
is honeycombed with traitors...

920
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:44,442
...waiting for their chance,
waiting perhaps for a leader.

921
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,778
A leader? Like Laszlo?

922
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:48,404
I have been thinking.

923
01:03:48,613 --> 01:03:51,699
It is too dangerous if you
let him go or let him stay.

924
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:52,950
I see what you mean.

925
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:00,416
Thank you, Carl.

926
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,710
Thank you, Carl.

927
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:05,254
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

928
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:07,965
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

929
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:09,342
Thank you very much.

930
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,345
I thought you'd ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

931
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:14,097
...and the dress glass.

932
01:04:14,347 --> 01:04:16,099
At last the day's came!

933
01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,435
We are speaking nothing
but English now.

934
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:22,438
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

935
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:24,440
A very nice idea.

936
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:26,192
To America.

937
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:27,652
To America.

938
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:36,911
What watch?

939
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,456
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

940
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,460
You'll get along
beautifully in America.

941
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,171
How is lady luck treating you?

942
01:04:47,422 --> 01:04:49,007
Oh, too bad.

943
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:51,509
You'll find him over there.

944
01:04:57,849 --> 01:04:59,267
Monsieur Rick?

945
01:04:59,517 --> 01:05:02,395
- Could I speak to you?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

946
01:05:02,603 --> 01:05:05,231
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should've known.

947
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,733
My husband is with me too.

948
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:09,610
He is? Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

949
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:10,695
Have a drink?

950
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:13,197
Of course not.
You mind if I do?

951
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:17,618
Monsieur Rick, what kind of a man
is Captain Renault?

952
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,495
Like any other man,
only more so.

953
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:22,915
No, I mean...
Is he trustworthy? Is his word...

954
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:25,084
Who told you to ask me that?

955
01:05:25,334 --> 01:05:26,961
He did. Captain Renault.

956
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,380
I thought so.
Where's your husband?

957
01:05:29,922 --> 01:05:33,885
At the roulette table, trying
to win enough for our exit visas.

958
01:05:34,135 --> 01:05:35,845
Of course he's losing.

959
01:05:36,054 --> 01:05:37,764
How long have you been married?

960
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:39,015
Eight weeks.

961
01:05:39,974 --> 01:05:41,976
We come from Bulgaria.

962
01:05:42,393 --> 01:05:44,395
Things are very bad there.

963
01:05:44,645 --> 01:05:47,023
The devil has the people
by the throat.

964
01:05:47,273 --> 01:05:49,859
So Jan and I, we...

965
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:52,653
We don't want our children
to grow up there.

966
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:55,156
So you decided to go to America.

967
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:57,617
But we have not much money...

968
01:05:58,076 --> 01:06:00,536
...and traveling is
so expensive and difficult.

969
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:03,039
It was more than
we thought to get here.

970
01:06:03,498 --> 01:06:05,375
Then Captain Renault sees us.

971
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,460
He's so kind.
He wants to help us.

972
01:06:07,668 --> 01:06:08,628
Yes, I'll bet.

973
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:11,381
He tells me he can give us
an exit visa.

974
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:13,800
But we have no money.

975
01:06:14,008 --> 01:06:15,593
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

976
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,804
And he's still willing
to give you a visa?

977
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:19,347
You want to know...

978
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,224
Will he keep his word?

979
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:23,434
He always has.

980
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,358
You are a man.

981
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:33,444
If someone loved you very much...

982
01:06:33,653 --> 01:06:37,657
...so that your happiness was the only
thing she wanted in the world...

983
01:06:38,574 --> 01:06:41,411
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

984
01:06:42,036 --> 01:06:43,287
...could you forgive her?

985
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:44,914
Nobody ever loved me that much.

986
01:06:45,123 --> 01:06:49,293
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

987
01:06:49,502 --> 01:06:50,920
...that would be all right?

988
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:53,548
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

989
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:54,924
Go back to Bulgaria.

990
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:59,470
But if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America.

991
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:02,890
But if Jan should find out...

992
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:04,767
He is such a boy.

993
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:08,229
In many ways,
I am so much older than he is.

994
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:10,857
Yes, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

995
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:13,526
Yours may work out.
You'll excuse me.

996
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:24,078
Good evening.

997
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,246
See? Here we are again.

998
01:07:25,496 --> 01:07:27,832
I'll take that as a compliment to Sam.

999
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:31,252
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

1000
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,922
He does. Could we have
a table close to him?

1001
01:07:35,173 --> 01:07:37,675
And as far away
from Strasser as possible.

1002
01:07:37,884 --> 01:07:40,470
The geography may be
difficult to arrange.

1003
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,347
Paul, table 30.

1004
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,349
Right this way, if you please.

1005
01:07:44,557 --> 01:07:48,269
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite.

1006
01:07:48,519 --> 01:07:49,896
Thank you.

1007
01:07:59,364 --> 01:08:00,865
Two cognac, please.

1008
01:08:25,223 --> 01:08:27,392
Do you wish to place
another bet, sir?

1009
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:29,686
No, I guess not.

1010
01:08:29,894 --> 01:08:31,854
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1011
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:34,816
I said "22."

1012
01:08:51,332 --> 01:08:52,792
Leave it there.

1013
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:09,892
Cash it in and don't come back.

1014
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:14,480
Are you sure this place is honest?

1015
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:18,234
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1016
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:22,739
How are we doing tonight?

1017
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:25,950
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

1018
01:09:36,502 --> 01:09:38,671
He's just a lucky guy.

1019
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:43,676
Monsieur Rick, may I get you
a cup of coffee?

1020
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:45,345
No thanks, Carl.

1021
01:09:49,474 --> 01:09:52,602
- Captain Renault, may I...
- Not here, please.

1022
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:54,937
Come to my office.
We'll be businesslike.

1023
01:09:55,188 --> 01:09:58,066
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

1024
01:09:58,274 --> 01:09:59,942
I'm very happy for both of you.

1025
01:10:00,151 --> 01:10:02,403
Still, it's very strange
that you won.

1026
01:10:02,612 --> 01:10:04,697
Well, maybe not so strange.

1027
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:07,700
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you so much.

1028
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:18,086
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1029
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:21,130
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1030
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:32,850
As I suspected.

1031
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:35,228
- You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Why?

1032
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:37,480
Why interfere
with my little romances?

1033
01:10:37,689 --> 01:10:39,565
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1034
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,275
I forgive you this time.

1035
01:10:41,526 --> 01:10:44,362
But I'll be in tomorrow
with a breathtaking blonde.

1036
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:47,281
And it'll make me
very happy if she loses.

1037
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,870
I wonder if I could talk to you?

1038
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:53,955
Go ahead.

1039
01:10:54,163 --> 01:10:55,832
Isn't there some other place?

1040
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:58,584
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1041
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:02,338
- In my office.
- Right.

1042
01:11:03,756 --> 01:11:06,509
You know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1043
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:09,595
I'm privileged to be one
of the leaders of a great movement.

1044
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,514
You know what I've been doing.

1045
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:15,810
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1046
01:11:16,019 --> 01:11:17,979
...that I continue my work.

1047
01:11:18,187 --> 01:11:19,564
I'm not interested in politics.

1048
01:11:19,814 --> 01:11:23,609
The problems of the world are not
in my department. I'm a saloonkeeper.

1049
01:11:24,068 --> 01:11:27,488
My friends in the underground tell me
that you've quite a record.

1050
01:11:27,697 --> 01:11:29,198
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1051
01:11:29,407 --> 01:11:32,243
- You fought the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

1052
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:35,621
Isn't it strange you always
seem to fight with the underdog?

1053
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:37,749
I found that an expensive hobby.

1054
01:11:37,957 --> 01:11:40,626
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1055
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:43,755
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate 100,000 francs?

1056
01:11:43,963 --> 01:11:45,381
I appreciate it,
but I don't accept it.

1057
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:46,799
I'll raise it to 200,000.

1058
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:51,637
Make it a million francs or three.
My answer would still be the same.

1059
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,015
There's a reason
you won't let me have them.

1060
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:55,391
There is.

1061
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,977
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1062
01:11:58,227 --> 01:12:00,897
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1063
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,608
- My wife?
- Yes.

1064
01:12:44,148 --> 01:12:46,109
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1065
01:14:02,268 --> 01:14:06,147
See? If Laszlo's presence in a café
can inspire this demonstration...

1066
01:14:06,397 --> 01:14:08,733
...what more will his
presence here bring on?

1067
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:11,110
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1068
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:14,072
- Everybody's having a good time.
- Much too good a time.

1069
01:14:14,322 --> 01:14:15,490
The place is to be closed.

1070
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:18,534
- But I've no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1071
01:14:23,706 --> 01:14:25,375
Everyone is to leave immediately.

1072
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:37,608
This café is closed
until further notice.

1073
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:30,004
Clear the room at once!

1074
01:14:33,091 --> 01:14:34,217
On what grounds?

1075
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:37,887
I'm shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1076
01:14:38,346 --> 01:14:40,056
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1077
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:41,557
Everybody out at once!

1078
01:14:46,062 --> 01:14:50,066
After this disturbance, it's not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1079
01:14:50,316 --> 01:14:52,860
This morning it wasn't safe
for him to leave.

1080
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:56,114
That's also true,
except to return to occupied France.

1081
01:14:56,364 --> 01:14:59,158
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1082
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:00,410
Of what value is that?

1083
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:03,496
Remember what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1084
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:06,958
- There are only two other alternatives.
- What are they?

1085
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:11,421
French authorities may find a reason to
put him in the concentration camp here.

1086
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:12,672
The other alternative?

1087
01:15:12,922 --> 01:15:17,635
Perhaps you have already observed
that, in Casablanca, human life is cheap.

1088
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:19,637
Good night, mademoiselle.

1089
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:32,984
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1090
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:58,843
Our faithful friend is still there.

1091
01:15:59,052 --> 01:16:01,596
Please don't go
to the underground meeting.

1092
01:16:01,804 --> 01:16:02,722
I must.

1093
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:06,184
It isn't often that a man gets to
display heroics before his wife.

1094
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:09,896
Don't joke. After Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1095
01:16:10,146 --> 01:16:11,814
I'm frightened too.

1096
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:14,525
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1097
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:16,444
Or carry on the best I can?

1098
01:16:17,028 --> 01:16:19,489
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1099
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:23,284
Why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1100
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:25,703
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1101
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:27,372
But he won't sell them.

1102
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,083
I'd think if sentiment won't
persuade him, money would.

1103
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:33,086
Did he give you any reason?

1104
01:16:33,336 --> 01:16:35,380
He suggested I ask you.

1105
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:36,631
Ask me?

1106
01:16:36,881 --> 01:16:39,425
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife."

1107
01:16:39,926 --> 01:16:42,011
I don't know why he said that.

1108
01:16:54,065 --> 01:16:57,235
Our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1109
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:00,571
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1110
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:04,742
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1111
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,621
When I was in the concentration camp...

1112
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:10,998
...were you lonely in Paris?

1113
01:17:12,917 --> 01:17:15,169
Yes, Victor. I was.

1114
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:18,297
I know how it is to be lonely.

1115
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:22,260
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1116
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:26,639
No, Victor. There isn't.

1117
01:17:30,977 --> 01:17:32,228
I love you very much.

1118
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:36,190
Yes.

1119
01:17:36,858 --> 01:17:38,526
Yes, I know.

1120
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:42,113
Whatever I do,
will you believe that I...

1121
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:44,782
You don't even have to say it.

1122
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,659
I'll believe.

1123
01:17:48,953 --> 01:17:50,413
Good night, dear.

1124
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:53,624
Good night.

1125
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:03,343
Yes, dear?

1126
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,099
Be careful.

1127
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:13,353
Of course I'll be careful.

1128
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:59,607
Well, you are in pretty good shape,
Herr Rick.

1129
01:18:59,816 --> 01:19:01,943
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1130
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,611
Two weeks, maybe three.

1131
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:05,947
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe worked before.

1132
01:19:06,197 --> 01:19:08,658
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1133
01:19:08,908 --> 01:19:09,992
Thank you.

1134
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:11,994
Sascha will be happy to hear it.

1135
01:19:12,245 --> 01:19:13,871
I owe him money.

1136
01:19:14,122 --> 01:19:16,958
- You finish locking up, will you?
- I will.

1137
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,253
- Then I'm going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me.

1138
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:21,713
I won't.

1139
01:19:22,839 --> 01:19:24,007
Good night.

1140
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:26,676
Good night, Mr.Rick.

1141
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,571
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1142
01:19:46,779 --> 01:19:50,158
I told you you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1143
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:51,617
Won't you sit down?

1144
01:19:51,826 --> 01:19:55,371
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1145
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:59,208
Your visit isn't connected by any chance
with the letters of transit?

1146
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:01,961
As long as I have them,
I'll never be lonely.

1147
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,756
Ask any price,
but give me those letters.

1148
01:20:04,964 --> 01:20:07,550
I went through that with
your husband. It's no deal.

1149
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:09,761
I know how you feel about me...

1150
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:12,680
...but please put that aside
for something important.

1151
01:20:12,889 --> 01:20:15,141
Do I have to hear again
how great your husband is...

1152
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:17,435
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1153
01:20:17,643 --> 01:20:19,145
It was your cause too.

1154
01:20:19,395 --> 01:20:21,814
In your way you were fighting
for the same thing.

1155
01:20:22,106 --> 01:20:24,984
I'm not fighting for anything anymore,
except myself.

1156
01:20:25,193 --> 01:20:27,278
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1157
01:20:33,701 --> 01:20:37,288
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all...

1158
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:40,166
I wouldn't bring up Paris.
It's poor salesmanship.

1159
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:43,920
Listen. If you knew what really
happened, if you knew the truth...

1160
01:20:44,128 --> 01:20:46,047
I wouldn't believe you no matter what.

1161
01:20:46,255 --> 01:20:48,716
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1162
01:20:53,554 --> 01:20:55,473
You want to feel sorry for yourself?

1163
01:20:56,599 --> 01:20:59,811
With so much at stake, all you can
think of is your own feeling.

1164
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:03,356
One woman has hurt you, and you
take revenge on the rest of the world.

1165
01:21:03,606 --> 01:21:06,651
You're a coward and a weakling!

1166
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:11,280
No.

1167
01:21:11,531 --> 01:21:13,116
Richard, I'm sorry.

1168
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,911
I'm sorry, but you...
You are our last hope.

1169
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,956
If you don't help us,
Victor will die in Casablanca.

1170
01:21:20,289 --> 01:21:21,165
What of it?

1171
01:21:21,374 --> 01:21:24,127
I'm gonna die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1172
01:21:31,009 --> 01:21:32,301
Now, if you'll...

1173
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:36,472
All right.

1174
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:38,641
I tried to reason with you.

1175
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,935
I tried everything.
I want those letters.

1176
01:21:41,436 --> 01:21:42,395
Get them for me.

1177
01:21:42,603 --> 01:21:44,480
I don't have to.
I got them right here.

1178
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:48,067
Put them on the table.

1179
01:21:50,028 --> 01:21:50,862
No.

1180
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:54,032
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1181
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:59,328
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1182
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,374
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1183
01:22:05,293 --> 01:22:08,212
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1184
01:22:15,845 --> 01:22:17,972
I tried to stay away.

1185
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,100
I thought I would never see you again.

1186
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,645
That you were out of my life.

1187
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:47,585
The day you left Paris...

1188
01:22:48,878 --> 01:22:51,130
...if you knew what I went through.

1189
01:22:52,423 --> 01:22:55,218
If you knew how much I loved you.

1190
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:58,638
How much I still love you.

1191
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:13,778
And then?

1192
01:23:15,905 --> 01:23:20,243
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1193
01:23:20,493 --> 01:23:23,996
They needed him in Prague.
But the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1194
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:25,540
Just two lines in the paper:

1195
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:28,584
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1196
01:23:30,003 --> 01:23:32,380
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1197
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:33,881
Then it came.

1198
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,592
He was dead.
Shot, trying to escape.

1199
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,555
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1200
01:23:41,431 --> 01:23:42,598
Then I met you.

1201
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:46,185
Why weren't you honest?
Why keep your marriage a secret?

1202
01:23:46,394 --> 01:23:49,731
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1203
01:23:49,981 --> 01:23:52,275
Not even our closest friends
knew about it.

1204
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:55,570
He was protecting me.
I knew about his work.

1205
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,157
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife,
it'd be dangerous for me...

1206
01:23:59,407 --> 01:24:00,867
...and for those working with us.

1207
01:24:01,659 --> 01:24:03,828
When did you first find out
he was alive?

1208
01:24:05,121 --> 01:24:07,457
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris.

1209
01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:10,209
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1210
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:13,755
They hid him in a freight car
in the outskirts of Paris.

1211
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:16,007
He was sick. He needed me.

1212
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:19,594
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1213
01:24:19,844 --> 01:24:24,557
I knew you wouldn't have left and the
Gestapo would have caught you, so I...

1214
01:24:27,435 --> 01:24:29,520
Well, you know the rest.

1215
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:34,567
It's still a story without an ending.

1216
01:24:35,276 --> 01:24:36,110
What about now?

1217
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:38,654
Now?

1218
01:24:39,447 --> 01:24:41,032
I don't know.

1219
01:24:41,741 --> 01:24:44,369
I know I'll never have
the strength to leave you again.

1220
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:46,662
And Laszlo?

1221
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:50,249
You'll help him now, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1222
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,753
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1223
01:24:54,003 --> 01:24:55,838
All except one.

1224
01:24:56,964 --> 01:24:58,549
He won't have you.

1225
01:25:00,468 --> 01:25:02,720
I can't fight it anymore.

1226
01:25:04,138 --> 01:25:07,100
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1227
01:25:09,686 --> 01:25:12,480
I don't know what's right any longer.

1228
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:15,233
You have to think for both of us.

1229
01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,193
For all of us.

1230
01:25:20,738 --> 01:25:21,823
All right.

1231
01:25:22,073 --> 01:25:23,449
I will.

1232
01:25:27,495 --> 01:25:29,414
Here's looking at you, kid.

1233
01:25:31,082 --> 01:25:34,002
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1234
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:48,641
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1235
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,393
They caught some of the others.

1236
01:25:50,643 --> 01:25:51,978
Come inside.

1237
01:25:56,315 --> 01:26:00,695
Come, Mr.Laszlo.
I will help you immediately.

1238
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,160
I'll give you some water.

1239
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:22,383
Carl, what happened?

1240
01:26:22,884 --> 01:26:26,596
The police break up our meeting.
We escaped in the last moment.

1241
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:29,098
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1242
01:26:29,307 --> 01:26:32,643
Turn out the light at the rear.
It may attract police.

1243
01:26:32,852 --> 01:26:34,228
Sascha always puts it out.

1244
01:26:34,437 --> 01:26:35,396
Tonight he forgot.

1245
01:26:36,105 --> 01:26:38,232
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1246
01:26:46,032 --> 01:26:47,742
Take Miss Lund home.

1247
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,285
Yes, sir.

1248
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:03,299
Just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1249
01:27:03,508 --> 01:27:05,510
This might come in handy.

1250
01:27:05,718 --> 01:27:06,928
Thank you.

1251
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:08,304
Had a close one?

1252
01:27:08,513 --> 01:27:09,764
Yes, rather.

1253
01:27:11,724 --> 01:27:14,477
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1254
01:27:14,686 --> 01:27:16,813
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1255
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,732
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1256
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:21,234
We stop breathing, we'll die.

1257
01:27:21,442 --> 01:27:23,486
We stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1258
01:27:23,695 --> 01:27:26,447
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1259
01:27:26,656 --> 01:27:28,700
You know how you sound?

1260
01:27:28,991 --> 01:27:33,121
Like a man who's convincing himself
of something he doesn't believe.

1261
01:27:33,329 --> 01:27:34,455
Each of us has a destiny.

1262
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:37,166
For good or for evil.

1263
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,292
I get the point.

1264
01:27:38,584 --> 01:27:40,086
I wonder if you do.

1265
01:27:40,294 --> 01:27:43,464
I wonder if you know you're trying
to escape from yourself.

1266
01:27:43,673 --> 01:27:45,049
You'll never succeed.

1267
01:27:45,425 --> 01:27:48,302
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1268
01:27:49,345 --> 01:27:52,098
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1269
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:54,517
I know that you're
in love with a woman.

1270
01:27:54,726 --> 01:27:56,686
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1271
01:27:56,894 --> 01:27:58,980
...that we're in love
with the same woman.

1272
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:01,899
The first evening
I came into this café...

1273
01:28:02,108 --> 01:28:05,028
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1274
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,113
Since no one is to blame...

1275
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:09,365
...I demand no explanation.

1276
01:28:09,574 --> 01:28:12,869
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters...

1277
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:14,037
...all right.

1278
01:28:14,746 --> 01:28:16,748
But I want my wife to be safe.

1279
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:18,249
I ask you as a favor...

1280
01:28:18,499 --> 01:28:21,502
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1281
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,628
You love her that much?

1282
01:28:23,087 --> 01:28:26,257
Apparently, you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1283
01:28:27,383 --> 01:28:29,510
I'm also a human being.

1284
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:31,179
Yes, I love her that much.

1285
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:40,313
- Mr.Laszlo?
- Yes?

1286
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,982
Come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1287
01:28:43,232 --> 01:28:44,067
On what charge?

1288
01:28:44,275 --> 01:28:46,444
The captain will discuss
that with you later.

1289
01:28:46,694 --> 01:28:49,364
It seems that destiny
has taken a hand.

1290
01:29:01,334 --> 01:29:05,421
You haven't any proof.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1291
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:09,467
You can fine him and give him 30 days.
You might as well let him go.

1292
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:12,804
I advise you not to be interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1293
01:29:13,054 --> 01:29:14,597
If you help him to escape...

1294
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:16,933
Why do you think I'd stick
my neck out for him?

1295
01:29:17,141 --> 01:29:19,686
Because, one, you bet
10,000 francs he'd escape.

1296
01:29:19,936 --> 01:29:23,064
Two, you've got the letters.
Don't bother to deny it.

1297
01:29:23,272 --> 01:29:26,109
You might do it because
you don't like Strasser's looks.

1298
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:27,985
I don't like them either.

1299
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:29,779
They're all excellent reasons.

1300
01:29:29,987 --> 01:29:31,948
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1301
01:29:32,156 --> 01:29:33,616
In this matter, I'm powerless.

1302
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:35,576
Besides, I might lose 10,000 francs.

1303
01:29:35,827 --> 01:29:40,498
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1304
01:29:40,707 --> 01:29:42,166
Yes, I have the letters.

1305
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:44,377
I intend using them myself.

1306
01:29:44,627 --> 01:29:48,047
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1307
01:29:48,297 --> 01:29:51,342
I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1308
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:53,469
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1309
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,223
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1310
01:29:57,473 --> 01:29:59,434
The last man I want to see in America.

1311
01:29:59,684 --> 01:30:01,310
You didn't come here to say this.

1312
01:30:01,519 --> 01:30:02,770
You have the letters.

1313
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:06,190
Fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1314
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:09,027
Why do you still care
what happens to Laszlo?

1315
01:30:09,235 --> 01:30:13,364
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1316
01:30:13,614 --> 01:30:17,118
We have a legal right to go,
but people have been held here...

1317
01:30:17,326 --> 01:30:19,328
...in spite of their legal rights.

1318
01:30:19,537 --> 01:30:21,205
Why do you think
we want to hold you?

1319
01:30:21,456 --> 01:30:22,790
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1320
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:25,918
She probably knows things
Strasser would like to know.

1321
01:30:26,127 --> 01:30:27,587
I'll make a deal with you.

1322
01:30:27,795 --> 01:30:31,632
Instead of this petty charge,
you could get something really big...

1323
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:34,510
...that would chuck him
in a camp for years.

1324
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,137
That'd be a feather in your cap.

1325
01:30:36,346 --> 01:30:39,557
It certainly would. Germany...
Vichy would be grateful.

1326
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:40,808
Then release him.

1327
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:43,644
Be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1328
01:30:43,853 --> 01:30:46,356
Laszlo will come there
to pick up the letters.

1329
01:30:46,606 --> 01:30:49,150
That'll give you the grounds
to make the arrest.

1330
01:30:49,484 --> 01:30:51,736
You get him, and we get away.

1331
01:30:51,944 --> 01:30:54,822
To the Germans, that last
will be just a minor annoyance.

1332
01:30:55,031 --> 01:30:57,825
There's still something
I don't understand.

1333
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,787
Miss Lund,
she is very beautiful, yes...

1334
01:31:00,995 --> 01:31:03,247
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1335
01:31:03,456 --> 01:31:04,916
She isn't just any woman.

1336
01:31:05,124 --> 01:31:06,417
I see.

1337
01:31:06,626 --> 01:31:08,753
How do I know you'll keep
your bargain?

1338
01:31:08,961 --> 01:31:11,714
I'll make the arrangements
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1339
01:31:11,923 --> 01:31:16,678
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
here who has even less scruples than I.

1340
01:31:17,053 --> 01:31:18,388
Thanks.

1341
01:31:18,930 --> 01:31:19,889
Go ahead, Ricky.

1342
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:24,602
Call off your watchdogs when you let
him go. I don't want them around today.

1343
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:27,146
I'm taking no chances,
not even with you.

1344
01:31:34,696 --> 01:31:37,073
Should we draw it up,
or is a handshake good enough?

1345
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:40,785
Certainly not good enough. But since
I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1346
01:31:40,993 --> 01:31:44,455
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and
go to America! You're a lucky man.

1347
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:48,167
My agreement with Sam is
that he gets 25% of the profits.

1348
01:31:48,376 --> 01:31:50,044
That still goes.

1349
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:52,839
I happen to know he gets 10%.
But he's worth 25.

1350
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:56,009
Abdul, Carl and Sascha stay
with the place or I don't sell.

1351
01:31:56,259 --> 01:31:59,012
Of course. Rick's
wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1352
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,138
So long.

1353
01:32:00,596 --> 01:32:03,182
Remember you owe Rick's
100 cartons of cigarettes.

1354
01:32:03,433 --> 01:32:05,852
I shall remember
to pay it to myself.

1355
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:43,848
- You're late.
- I was informed as he left the hotel.

1356
01:32:44,057 --> 01:32:45,224
So I'm on time.

1357
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:48,436
- I said to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed.

1358
01:32:48,644 --> 01:32:50,730
This place won't
be the same without you.

1359
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:54,192
I've already spoken to Ferrari.
You'll still win at roulette.

1360
01:32:54,442 --> 01:32:55,526
Is everything ready?

1361
01:32:55,777 --> 01:32:57,111
I have the letters here.

1362
01:32:57,445 --> 01:32:59,530
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1363
01:32:59,781 --> 01:33:01,115
Sam's piano.

1364
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,743
Serves me right
for not being musical.

1365
01:33:03,993 --> 01:33:04,994
Here they are.

1366
01:33:05,495 --> 01:33:07,372
You better wait in my office.

1367
01:33:16,881 --> 01:33:19,550
Victor thinks I'm going with him.
Haven't you told him?

1368
01:33:19,759 --> 01:33:21,969
- Not yet.
- But it's all right, isn't it?

1369
01:33:22,178 --> 01:33:23,638
Everything's quite all right.

1370
01:33:23,888 --> 01:33:27,934
We'll tell him at the airport. The less
time to think, the easier. Trust me.

1371
01:33:30,937 --> 01:33:32,230
Yes, I will.

1372
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:41,406
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We still have a lot to do.

1373
01:33:43,157 --> 01:33:46,577
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1374
01:33:46,786 --> 01:33:48,663
- We made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1375
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,415
You won't have
trouble in Lisbon?

1376
01:33:50,873 --> 01:33:52,041
No. It's all arranged.

1377
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,335
Good. The letters are
made out in blank.

1378
01:33:54,585 --> 01:33:57,005
All you have to do is
fill in the signatures.

1379
01:33:57,505 --> 01:33:58,756
Victor Laszlo...

1380
01:33:59,298 --> 01:34:00,925
...you're under arrest.

1381
01:34:04,804 --> 01:34:08,641
For accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom these were stolen.

1382
01:34:09,392 --> 01:34:12,687
You're surprised about Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1383
01:34:12,895 --> 01:34:15,648
Love, it seems, has triumphed
over virtue. Thank...

1384
01:34:16,524 --> 01:34:20,903
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's gonna
be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1385
01:34:21,112 --> 01:34:24,157
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- I have. Sit down.

1386
01:34:24,365 --> 01:34:27,410
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will if you take one more step.

1387
01:34:28,161 --> 01:34:30,997
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1388
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,167
Keep your hands down.

1389
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:37,045
I wonder if you realize
what this means?

1390
01:34:37,295 --> 01:34:39,380
I do. We'll discuss that later.

1391
01:34:39,589 --> 01:34:41,132
Call off the watchdogs, you said.

1392
01:34:41,341 --> 01:34:43,593
Call the airport.
You tell them.

1393
01:34:43,843 --> 01:34:46,471
Remember, this gun is pointed
right at your heart.

1394
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:49,349
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1395
01:34:56,481 --> 01:34:58,399
Hello? Is that the airport?

1396
01:34:59,776 --> 01:35:01,277
Captain Renault speaking.

1397
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:04,155
There'll be two
letters of transit for Lisbon.

1398
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:06,324
There's to be no trouble about them.

1399
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:07,533
Good.

1400
01:35:14,332 --> 01:35:15,792
My car, quickly.

1401
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,544
This is Strasser.

1402
01:35:18,753 --> 01:35:20,963
Have police meet me
at the airport at once.

1403
01:35:21,214 --> 01:35:22,924
At once, do you hear?

1404
01:35:29,764 --> 01:35:31,724
Hello, radio tower?

1405
01:35:31,974 --> 01:35:34,977
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1406
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:37,772
Visibility one and one-half miles.

1407
01:35:38,022 --> 01:35:39,232
Light ground fog.

1408
01:35:39,482 --> 01:35:41,818
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1409
01:35:42,068 --> 01:35:44,404
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1410
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,794
Have him go with Laszlo
to take care of his luggage.

1411
01:36:00,003 --> 01:36:02,046
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1412
01:36:02,296 --> 01:36:05,258
Find Mr.Laszlo's luggage
and put it on the plane.

1413
01:36:05,675 --> 01:36:06,676
This way, please.

1414
01:36:08,594 --> 01:36:11,556
Fill in the names.
That'll make it even more official.

1415
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:14,017
You think of everything, don't you?

1416
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:16,561
The names are
Mr.and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1417
01:36:16,811 --> 01:36:17,645
But...

1418
01:36:17,854 --> 01:36:18,855
...why my name?

1419
01:36:19,063 --> 01:36:20,523
You're getting on that plane.

1420
01:36:20,732 --> 01:36:21,899
But what about you?

1421
01:36:22,108 --> 01:36:24,193
I'm staying here
till the plane gets away.

1422
01:36:24,402 --> 01:36:26,154
What's happened to you?
Last night...

1423
01:36:26,404 --> 01:36:28,614
Last night we said
a great many things.

1424
01:36:28,823 --> 01:36:30,533
You said I was to do the thinking
for us.

1425
01:36:30,783 --> 01:36:33,036
I've done a lot.
It all adds up to one thing:

1426
01:36:33,286 --> 01:36:36,164
You're getting on that plane with Victor
where you belong.

1427
01:36:36,372 --> 01:36:38,333
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1428
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:41,169
Do you know what you'd have
to look forward to here?

1429
01:36:41,419 --> 01:36:45,131
We'd both wind up in a
concentration camp. Isn't that true?

1430
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:47,133
Major Strasser would insist.

1431
01:36:47,342 --> 01:36:50,803
- You're saying this to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1432
01:36:51,012 --> 01:36:53,139
Inside we both know
you belong with Victor.

1433
01:36:53,348 --> 01:36:55,683
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1434
01:36:55,892 --> 01:36:58,770
If that plane leaves and you're not
with him, you'll regret it.

1435
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,398
Maybe not today, not tomorrow,
but soon. For the rest of your life.

1436
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:04,484
But what about us?

1437
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:07,028
We'll always have Paris.

1438
01:37:07,278 --> 01:37:10,281
We didn't have. We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1439
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,617
We got it back last night.

1440
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:16,954
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1441
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,123
I've got a job to do too.

1442
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:22,835
Where I go, you can't follow.
What I have to do, you can't be part of.

1443
01:37:23,544 --> 01:37:25,129
I'm no good at being noble.

1444
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:28,466
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three people...

1445
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:31,552
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1446
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:33,888
Someday you'll understand that.

1447
01:37:38,976 --> 01:37:41,062
Here's looking at you, kid.

1448
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,788
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1449
01:37:58,997 --> 01:38:01,124
There's something you should know.

1450
01:38:01,332 --> 01:38:03,084
I don't ask you
to explain anything.

1451
01:38:03,292 --> 01:38:05,920
It may make a difference
to you later on.

1452
01:38:06,212 --> 01:38:08,381
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1453
01:38:08,715 --> 01:38:11,259
She was at my place
last night when you were.

1454
01:38:11,509 --> 01:38:14,137
She came there for the letters.
Isn't that true?

1455
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:16,305
Yes.

1456
01:38:17,056 --> 01:38:18,975
She tried everything.
Nothing worked.

1457
01:38:19,267 --> 01:38:22,937
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1458
01:38:23,146 --> 01:38:25,606
But that was all over long ago.

1459
01:38:25,815 --> 01:38:28,776
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't.
I let her pretend.

1460
01:38:29,861 --> 01:38:30,903
I understand.

1461
01:38:31,237 --> 01:38:32,071
Here it is.

1462
01:38:32,572 --> 01:38:33,406
Thanks.

1463
01:38:34,157 --> 01:38:35,783
I appreciate it.

1464
01:38:36,909 --> 01:38:38,578
Welcome back to the fight.

1465
01:38:38,786 --> 01:38:41,164
This time I know our side will win.

1466
01:38:55,094 --> 01:38:56,137
Are you ready?

1467
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,308
Yes, I'm ready.

1468
01:39:03,728 --> 01:39:04,771
Goodbye, Rick.

1469
01:39:05,813 --> 01:39:07,315
God bless you.

1470
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:11,569
Better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1471
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:31,422
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1472
01:39:31,673 --> 01:39:33,216
Stay where you are.

1473
01:39:33,466 --> 01:39:36,260
- I don't know what you mean.
- What you did for Laszlo.

1474
01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:38,638
And that fairy tale
to send Ilsa away with him.

1475
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:42,767
I know a little about women. She went,
but she knew you were lying.

1476
01:39:43,726 --> 01:39:45,520
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1477
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:48,231
This isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us.

1478
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:50,066
Especially for you.

1479
01:39:50,316 --> 01:39:51,609
I'll have to arrest you.

1480
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:53,695
As soon as the plane goes.

1481
01:40:00,994 --> 01:40:03,037
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1482
01:40:03,246 --> 01:40:05,039
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1483
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,669
Why do you stand here?
Why not stop him?

1484
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:11,879
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1485
01:40:14,382 --> 01:40:15,591
Get away from that phone.

1486
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,051
Do not interfere.

1487
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:19,387
I was willing to shoot Renault.
I'll shoot you.

1488
01:40:23,141 --> 01:40:24,017
Put that phone down.

1489
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:26,144
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1490
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:42,660
Major Strasser has been shot.

1491
01:40:47,665 --> 01:40:49,917
Round up the usual suspects.

1492
01:41:13,941 --> 01:41:17,445
You're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1493
01:41:17,653 --> 01:41:19,739
Maybe. It seemed like
a good time to start.

1494
01:41:19,947 --> 01:41:22,033
I think perhaps you're right.

1495
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:50,812
It might be good for you to disappear
from Casablanca for a while.

1496
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,272
There's a Free French garrison
at Brazzaville.

1497
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:55,149
I could arrange passage.

1498
01:41:55,817 --> 01:41:57,402
My letter of transit?

1499
01:41:57,652 --> 01:41:58,820
I could use a trip.

1500
01:41:59,028 --> 01:42:02,198
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1501
01:42:02,448 --> 01:42:05,451
And that 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1502
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,495
"Our" expenses?

1503
01:42:07,745 --> 01:42:08,788
Louis...

1504
01:42:08,997 --> 01:42:12,709
...I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
