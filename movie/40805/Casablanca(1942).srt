卡萨布兰卡/北非谍影

2
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,210
二次大战临近...
With the coming of the Second World War...

3
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,540
...很多被困在欧洲的人们怀着希望 甚至急切地...
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately...

4
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,550
...想要来到自由的美洲
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

5
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,420
里斯本成为联络的航运地点
Lisbon became the great embarkation point.

6
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,790
不过 并非每个人均能直接到达里斯本
But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly.

7
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,890
因此 一条艰苦迂回的逃难路线出现了
And so a torturous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up.

8
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,560
从巴黎到马赛...
Paris to Marseilles...

9
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,240
...越过地中海到奥朗
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

10
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,050
然后搭车或走路 沿着非洲的海岸线...
Then, by train or auto or foot, across the rim of Africa...

11
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,730
...来到法属摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

12
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,520
在这里 幸运的人凭借钱、影响力或运气...
Here, the fortunate ones, through money or influence or luck...

13
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,200
...可能会拿到出境许可证 然后赶往里斯本
...might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon.

14
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,800
再从里斯本到新世界
And from Lisbon to the New World.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
不过 其余在卡萨布兰卡的人则要等待
But the others wait in Casablanca.

16
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,330
等待 等待 再等待...
And wait and wait...

17
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,340
一直等待
...and wait.

18
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,580

20
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,630
...在从奥朗开出的火车上被杀
...murdered on train from Oran.

21
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,820
凶手和可能的共犯 正前往卡萨布兰卡
Murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca.

22
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,830
拘留所有嫌疑人物 并搜查被偷走的文件
Round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document.

23
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,600
这个任务相当重要
Important.

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,310

25
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,770
可否看一下你的证件？
May we see your papers?

26
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,770
我没有带在身上
I don't think I have them on me.

27
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,270
- 既然如此 我们必须请你跟我们走 - 等一下 可能是…
- In that case, you'll have to come along. - Wait. It 's possible that I...

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,540
在这里
Yes. Here they are.

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,620
这些证件三个星期前已过期了 你必须跟我们走
These papers expired three weeks ago. You'll have to come along.

30
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,450

Halt!

34
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,020
对不起 先生 你没听说吗？
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame. Have you not heard?

35
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,980
我们听到的不多 我们能听明白的更少
We hear very little, and we understand even less.

36
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,820
两位德国快递员在无人的沙漠被发现惨遭谋杀
Two German couriers were found murdered in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

37
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,500
这是惯例性的搜捕难民、自由主义者...
This is the customary roundup of refugees, liberals...

38
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,330
还有要送给警察首长的漂亮女孩
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl for Renault, the prefect of police.

39
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,960
随着这些难民 欧洲的坏蛋们都来到了卡萨布兰卡
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

40
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,540
有些为了出境证等了好几年
Some of them have been waiting years for a visa.

41
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,010
先生 我劝你要当心 谨慎提防
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself. Be on guard.

这个地方布满了贪婪的人
This place is full of vultures.

满大街都是贪婪的人

49
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,690
- 我真笨   - 怎么了 亲爱的？
- Oh, how silly of me.  - What, dear?

50
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,230
我把皮夹子落在饭店了
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

他听不明白你说什么 (法语)

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,840
你可能觉得卡萨布兰卡的天气有一点暖
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm.

66
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,670
全德国人必须适应各种天气 从俄国到撒哈拉
We Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

67
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,950
- 或许你所指的不是天气 - 不然会是什么？
- Perhaps you werert referring to weather. - What else?

68
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,380
关于被谋杀的快递员 你们做了些什么？
The murder of the couriers. What has been done?

很好 这个人已在警方监管中吗？

I've already heard about this cafe. And also about Mr. Rick himself.

74
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,110
等待 等待 等待
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

75
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,290
我永远离不开这里了
I'll never get out of here.

76
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,560
我会死在卡萨布兰卡
I'll die in Casablanca.

77
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,990
可是你不能再加一点吗？
But can't you make it just a little more?

78

求求你
Please?

79
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,760
对不起 女士 可是钻石在市场上不易脱手
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

80
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,200
到处都是钻石 两千四百元

95
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,310
可否问瑞克要不要跟我们喝酒？
Will you ask Rick if he'll have a drink with us?

96
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,980
女士 他从来不跟顾客喝酒
Madame, he never drinks with customers. Never. I have never seen it.

97
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,020
是什么原因使酒吧老板如此势利？
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

98
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,060
如果你告诉他 我在阿姆斯特丹经营第二大银行
Perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

99
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,890
第二大？那不会叫瑞克刮目相看
Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick.

100
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,620
阿姆斯特丹的头号银行家 现在是我们厨房的糕饼师傅
The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

101
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,300

对不起
Excuse me.

107
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,670
对不起 先生 这是私人房间
I'm sorry, sir. This is a private room.

108
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,430
好大胆 我知道里面在赌博
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...? I know there is gambling in there.

109
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,770
- 你岂敢不让我进去？ - 这位先生 有什么麻烦？
- You dare not keep me out. - Yes? What's the trouble?

110
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,970
从夏威夷到柏林 每个赌场我都去过
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin.

111
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,210
如果你认为不该让我进这种赌场 可是大错特错
And if you think I' m going to be kept out of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

112
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,360
不好意思 哈罗 瑞克
Excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.

113
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,820
你的现金在酒吧可以用
Your cash is good at the bar.

114
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,990
什么？你知道我是谁吗？
What? Do you know who I am?

115
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,170
我知道 酒吧让你光顾 算你走运
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

116
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,340
可恶 我会向有关当局报告
This is outrageous! I shall report it to The Angriff.

117
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,770
看你刚才那样对待德国银行家
You know, watching you just now,

118
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,670
人们会以为你整辈子都在做这种事
one would think you've been doing this all your life.

119
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
- 是什么使你认为我没有？  - 没什么
- What makes you think I haven't?  - Nothing.

120
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,820
- 不过你刚来卡萨布兰卡时 我想… - 你想什么？
- But when you first came, I thought... - You thought what?

121
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,520
我有什么权利去想？
What right do I have to think?

122
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,820
可以吗？
May I

123
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,520
那两名德国快递员真不幸 对不对？
Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?

124
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,360
他们走运了 昨天他们还是两名德国办事员
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just clerks...

125
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,800
而今天他们成了光荣的死者
...today they are the honored dead.

126
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,840
你是个很愤世嫉俗的人 瑞克 请原谅我这样说
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.

127
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,170
我原谅你
I forgive you.

128
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,040
- 谢谢 你可否跟我喝一杯？ - 不
- Will you have a drink with me?  - No.

129
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,210
我忘了你从不跟任何人喝酒 请再给我一杯
I forgot, you never drink with... I'll have another, please.

130
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,880
你看不起我 对不对？
You despise me, don't you?

131
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,240
如果是我使你这样想 那我大概是吧
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.

132
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,750
可是为什么？
But why?

133
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,850
你反对我所做的那种生意?
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

134
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,340
可是为那些可怜的难民想一想...
But think of all those poor refugees...

135
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,020
如果我不帮忙 他们必然会困死在这里
who must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

136
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,790
那不算太坏 他们通过我得到出境许可证
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own, I provide them with exit visas.

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,230
有代价的 尤佳迪 有代价的
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

138
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,800
为那些付不起雷诺开的价钱的可怜虫想想
But think of all the poor devils who can't meet Renault 's price.

139
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,410
我以半价替他们弄到手 这算寄生虫吗？
I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?

140
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,170
我不反对寄生虫 我反对折价的寄生虫
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.

141
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,750
在今晚之后 所有的事情将成过去
Well, after tonight I will be through with the whole business.

142
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,610
我要离开卡萨布兰卡
And I' m leaving, finally, this Casablanca.

143
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,850
你的出境许可是向谁买的？雷诺还是你自己？
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?

144
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,520
我自己  因为我觉得自己的价钱比较合理
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.

145
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,050
你看
Look, Rick.

146
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,400
知道这是什么吗？
Know what this is?

147
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,700
你从来没有见过的东西
Something that even you have never seen.

148
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,030
过境信函 由戴高乐将军签名的
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle.

149
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,540
不能废止 甚至不能盘问
Cannot be rescinded. Not even questioned.

150
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,670
等一下
One moment.

151
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,170
今晚我会以天价卖出去
Tonight I' II be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of.

152
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,180
然后 再见 卡萨布兰卡
And then, addio, Casablanca.

153
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,420
瑞克 我在卡萨布兰卡有很多朋友 不晓得什么原因...
I have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow,

154
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,680
...也许是因为你看不起我...
...just because you despise me...

155
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,320
...你是我唯一信任的人
...you are the only one I trust.

156
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,380
请你替我保管 好吗？
Will you keep these for me, please?

157
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,350
- 多久？ - 或许一小时 或许久一点点
- For how long?  - Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

158
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,290
- 我不要放过夜 - 别担心
- I don't want them here overnight. - Don't be afraid of that.

159
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,050
请替我保管
Please keep them for me.

160
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,430
谢谢 我知道我可以信任你
Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

161
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,940
服务生 我正在等一些人
Waiter. I' II be expecting some people.

162
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,000
如果有谁找我 我会在这里
If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.

163
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,210
瑞克...
Rick...

164
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,530
...我想你现在对我会刮目相看
...I hope you're more impressed with me now.

165
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,140
请恕我失陪 我要跟你的轮盘分享我的好运气
If you'll forgive me, I' II share my good luck with your roulette wheel.

166
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,410
等一下
Just a moment.

167
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,620
我听谣言说 那两名德国快递员身上带着过境信函
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit.

168
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,890
我也听过那谣言 可怜虫
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

169
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,030
你说对了 尤佳迪 我是对你比较刮目相看了
You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you.

170
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,910
- 你好 瑞克 - 你好 法拉利
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Ferrari.

171
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,710
"蓝鹦鹉"的生意如何？
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

172
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
- 很好 不过我想买你的咖啡馆 - 那是不卖的
- Fine, but I' d like to buy your cafe. - It 's not for sale.

173
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,820
- 你还没听我出价呢  - 多少钱也不卖
- You haven't heard my offer. - It 's not for sale at any price.

174
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,550
- 你要多少才肯卖山姆？- 我不买卖人口
- What do you want for Sam?  - I don't buy or sell human beings.

175
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,890
可惜 人是卡萨布兰卡的主要商品
Too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

176
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,010
如果你跟我一起做黑市生意
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,

177
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,160
光只是难民 我们就能大赚一笔
if you'd work with me in the black market.

178
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,730
不妨你做你的 我做我的
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.

179
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,010
我们不妨去问问山姆 也许他喜欢改变一下
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.

180
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,270
我们不妨去问一下
Suppose we do.

181
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,680
瑞克 你什么时候才明白 在今天这个世界...
When will you realize that in this world today...

182
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,380
孤立不再是项实际的政策
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

183
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,340
法拉利想要你到"蓝鹦鹉"工作
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.

184
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,610
我喜欢这里
Oh, I like it fine here.

185
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,680
- 他出双倍薪水  - 我在这里赚的钱已没时间花
- He'll double what I pay you.  - I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

186
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,150
对不起
Sorry.

187
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,320
老板的私人存货
The boss's private stock...

188
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,930
- 因为 伊娃 我爱你 - 闭嘴
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.  - Oh, shut up.

189
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,090
好吧 为了你 我会闭嘴 因为 伊娃 我爱你
All right, all right. For you, I shut up, because, Yvonne, I love you.

190
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,370
瑞克先生 瑞克先生
Mr. Rick?  Mr. Rick?

191
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,470
一些德国人付了这张支票 行不行？
Some Germans gave this check. Is it all right?

192
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,980
你昨晚到哪里去了？
Where were you last night?

193
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,410
那么久以前的事 我记不起来了
That's so long ago, I don't remember.

194
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,080
- 我今晚可以见到你吗？- 我从不计划那么遥远的事
- Will I see you tonight?  - I never make plans that far ahead.

195
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,620
再给我一杯
Give me another.

196
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,560
- 沙克 她已喝够了 - 别听他的 帮我倒满
- Sascha, she's had enough. - Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

197
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,920
伊娃我爱你 可是他付我薪水
Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me.

198
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,600
- 瑞克 我已厌倦了你… - 沙克 叫部计程车
- Rick, I' m tired of having you... - Sascha, call a cab.

199
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,200
- 来吧 我们去拿你的外衣 - 别碰我
- We're gonna get your coat. - Take your hands off me.

200
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,930
你喝醉了 你该回家了
You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.

201
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,370
嘿 计程车
Hey, taxi.

202
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,240
你以为你是谁？把我推来推去？
Who do you think you are, pushing me around?

203
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,170
我真是傻瓜 爱上你这种男人
I was a fool to fall for a man like you.

204
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,370
沙克 你送她 要肯定她回到家
Go with her, Sascha. Be sure she gets home.

205
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,520
然后马上回来
And come right back.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,220
是 老板
Yes, boss.

207
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,660
- 你好 瑞克 - 你好 路易
- Hello, Rick. - Hello, Louis.

208
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,130
你真奢侈 这样把女人抛开
How extravagant you are, throwing away women.

209
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,030
有一天她们可能会渐渐消失
Someday they may be scarce.

210
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,470
我想现在我该去拜访伊娃
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

211
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,260
或许可借反作用占到便宜
Maybe get her on the rebound.

212
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,570
一讲到女人 你就是不折不扣的民主党
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.

213
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,880
(法语)

214
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,820
如果他听得明白一个字 意大利将大获全胜
If he gets a word in, it'll be a major Italian victory.

215
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,850
飞往里斯本的飞机
The plane to Lisbon.

216
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,330
你会想坐在里面
You would like to be on it?

217
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,200
为什么？里斯本有什么好？
Why? What's in Lisbon?

218
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,440
到美国的快航
The clipper to America.

219
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,340
我常思索为什么你不返回美国
I've often speculated on why you don't return to America.

220
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,480
你卷走教堂的基金逃走？你跟参议员的太太私奔？
Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife?

221
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,540
我喜欢想象你杀了人 这会满足我浪漫的遐想
Llike to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.

222
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,410
是三者的综合
It's a combination of all three.

223
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,050
到底是什么带你到卡萨布兰卡？
And what in heavers name brought you to Casablanca?

224
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,690
我的健康 我来卡萨布兰卡是为了这地方的水
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.

225
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,150
水？什么水？我们在沙漠里
The waters? What waters? We're in the desert.

226
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,560
我的消息错误
I was misinformed.

227
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,500
对不起 瑞克先生
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

228
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,500
里面一位先生赢了两万块法O...
A gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs...

229
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,060
出纳需要一些钱
...and the cashier would like some money.

230
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,670
我从保险柜拿
I'll get it from the safe.

231
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,400
我好难过 瑞克先生  我...
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...

232
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,200
别提了 艾米 这种事常常发生
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.

233
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,180
我非常抱歉
I'm awfully sorry.

234
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,720
瑞克 今晚这里会有点刺激的事
Rick, there will be some excitement here tonight.

235
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,420
我们将在你的咖啡馆逮捕人
We gonna make an arrest in your cafe.

236
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,320
- 又来？ - 这不是普通的逮捕
- Again?  - This is no ordinary arrest.

237
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,890
是谋杀犯
A murderer, no less.

238
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,120
如果你想要警告他 别让自己不方便 你逃不过监视的
If you're thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

239
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,130
- 我不为任何人冒险 - 明智的外交政策
- I stick my neck out for nobody.  - A wise foreign policy.

240
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,730
(法语)

241
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,400
我们本可以在今晚之前在蓝鹦鹉进行逮捕
Could have made the arrest earlier, at the Blue Parrot.

242
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,700
为了表示我对你的敬意 我们在这里进行
Out of my regard for you, we're staging it here.

243
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,340
可以带给你的顾客一点娱乐
It will amuse your customers.

244
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,040
我们的娱乐节目已经够多了
Our entertainment's enough.

245
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,680
瑞克 今晚我们这里有名贵客
We're to have an important guest here tonight.

246
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,350
第三帝国的史查沙少校
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

247
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,710
我们进行逮捕时 希望他在场
We want him to be here when we make the arrest.

248
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,450
以示范一下我办事的效率
A demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.

249
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,560
我明白 史查沙来这里干什么？
I see. And what's Strasser doing here?

250
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,600
他不可能大老远来到卡萨布兰卡...
He certainly didn't come here...

251
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,660
...只是为了目击你的办事效率吧？
...to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.

252
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,960
- 或许不是  - 拿去吧
- Perhaps not.  - Here you are.

253
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,260
- 不会再发生这种事了 - 没关系
- It shall not happen again. - That's all right.

254
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,300
我知道你心里有事情 何不直接说出来？
Louis, you got something on your mind. Why don't you spill it.

255
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,970
你观察力真好
How observant you are.

256
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,040
事实上我想劝告你一句
As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.

257
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,180
是吗？
Yeah?

258
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,780
- 要喝白兰地吗？- 谢谢
- Have a brandy? - Thank you.

259
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,300
瑞克 在这咖啡馆里有很多出境证卖出去
Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe,

260
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,910
不过我们知道你一张也没卖过
but we know that you've never sold one.

261
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,580
所以我们才准许你营业
That is the reason we permit you to remain open.

262
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,050
我还以为是我让你在轮盘赢钱
I thought it was because llet you win at roulette.

263
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,450
那是另一个原因
That is another reason.

264
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,420
有一个要前往美国的人已抵达卡萨布兰卡
There is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America.

265
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,500
他会给任何提供他出境证的人一大笔钱
He will offer a fortune to anyone who'll furnish an exit visa.

266
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,170
- 他叫什么名字？- 维克多?拉斯罗
- What's his name? - Victor Laszlo.

267
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,970
维克多?拉斯罗？
Victor Laszlo?

268
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,730
瑞克 这是我第一次看到有人如此令你着迷
Rick, that is the first time I've seen you so impressed.

269
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,870
半个地球的人都为他着迷
He's succeeded in impressing half the world.

270
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,510
我的责任就是阻止另一半的地球人不再为他着迷
It's my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half.

271
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,680
拉斯罗绝不能踏足美国 他要留在卡萨布兰卡
Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.

272
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,950
看他如何达成将很有趣
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.

273
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,280
- 达成什么？- 他的逃亡
- Manages what? - His escape.

274
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,350
- 我刚才告诉你… - 够了
- But I just told you... - Stop it.

275
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,180
他从集中营逃出来 纳粹党在欧洲到处追捕他
He escaped from a concentration camp. The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

276
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,690
这是追捕的最终站
This is the end of the chase.

277
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,490
我赌两万法O 这里不是追捕的最终站
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

278
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,030
这是认真的吗？
Is that a serious offer?

279
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,560
我刚赔了两万 我想赚回来
I just paid out 20, and I' d like to get it back.

280
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,560
加到十万吧 我只是个贫穷的腐败官吏
Make it 10. I'm only a poor corrupt official.

281
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,560
- 好吧 - 成交
- Okay. - Done.

282
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,500
不管他多聪明 他仍然需要一份出境许可证
No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa.

283
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,730
或许我应该说是两份
Or I should say two.

284
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,230
- 为什么是两份？- 他和一位女士一起
- Why two? - He is traveling with a lady.

285
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,170
- 一份他也会要的  - 我不认为 我见过那位女士
- He'll take one. - I think not. I' ve seen the lady.

286
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,110
如果他没把她留在马赛或奥朗...
And if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran...

287
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,740
...也肯定不会把她留在卡萨布兰卡
...he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.

288
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,080
或许他没有你那么浪漫
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.

289
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,520
都一样 他不会拿到出境证
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.

290
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,750
是什么使你觉得我可能有兴趣帮助拉斯罗逃亡？
What ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape?

291
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,290
因为我怀疑在那愤世嫉俗的外表下...
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell...

292
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,200
...你的内心是个性情中人
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

293
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,770
你要笑 随便你 不过我凑巧熟知你的记录
Laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record.

294
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,100
让我举出两项
Let me point out just two items:

295
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,400
1935年 你运枪械到衣索匹亚
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

296
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,510
1936年 你在西班牙替反佛朗哥派打仗
In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.

297
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,010
两次我都得到了丰厚的酬劳
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

298
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,520
胜方本可以给你更好的酬劳
The winning side would have paid you much better.

299
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,920
或许吧
Maybe.

300
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,190
似乎你坚决要把拉斯罗留在这里
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here.

301
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,160
我奉命行事
I have my orders.

302
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,790
我明白了 德国秘密警察
I see. Gestapo spank.

303
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
瑞克 你高估了秘密警察的影响力了
My dear Ricky, you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo.

304
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,330
我不干涉他们 他们也不干涉我
I don't interfere with them, and they don't interfere with me.

305
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,630
在卡萨布兰卡 我掌握自己的命运
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

306
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,930
- 我...  - 史查沙少校来了 长官
- I am... - Major Strasser is here, sir.

307
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,340
- 你刚说...  - 失陪
- You were saying? - Excuse me.

308
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,350
卡尔 给史查沙少校最好的位子 靠近女士们的
Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table, close to the ladies.

309
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,150
我已经给他最好的了 知道他是德国人 反正他一定接受
I have already given him the best, knowing he is German and would take it anyway.

310
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,490
静静地逮捕 每个门口派两个守卫
Take him quietly. Two guards at every door.

311
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,400
- 一切都准备好了 长官 - 去吧
- Everything is ready, sir. - Go ahead.

312
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,480
- 晚上好 先生 - 晚上好 队长
- Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, captain.

313
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,670
- 要一块坐吗？- 谢谢
- Wort you join us? - Thank you.

314
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,480
- 很荣幸你能光临本店 - 香槟和鱼子酱
- It 's a pleasure to have you here, major. - Champagne and a tin of caviar.

315
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,060
容我推荐华提可 很好的法国酒
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26, a good French wine.

316
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,190
好的 先生
Very well, sir.

317
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,730
- 很有趣的俱乐部 - 特别是今晚 长官
- A very interesting club. - Especially so tonight, major.

318
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,530
几分钟后 你将会看到那个谋杀快递员的人
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.

319
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,190
我正期待如此 队长
I expected no less, captain.

320
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,030
尤佳迪先生
Monsieur Ugarte.

321
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,040
什么事?
Yes?

322
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,440
- 请你跟我们走 - 当然
- Will you please come with us? - Certainly.

323
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,680
我可否先把筹码换回现金？
May I first please cash my chips?

324
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,450
运气不错呢 麻烦你 两千
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

325
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,800
谢谢
Thank you.

326
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,280
瑞克 瑞克 救我
Rick! Rick, help me!

327
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,600
别傻了 你逃不掉的
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.

328
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,580
瑞克 把我藏起来 想办法 你一定要帮我
But, Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me.

329
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,890
瑞克! 瑞克!
Rick. Rick.

330
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,560
非常好 队长
Excellent, captain.

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,390
当他们来抓我时 希望你多尽点力
When they come for me, I hope you'll be more of a help.

332
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,660
我不为任何人冒险
I stick my neck out for nobody.

333
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,700
各位 很抱歉有点骚乱 不过现在都过去了
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now.

334
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,430
尽管坐下来尽情享受 好了 山姆
Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

335
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,680
瑞克 这位是第三帝国的海米勒?史查沙少校
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.

336
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,790
- 瑞克先生 你好  - 你好
- How do you do, Mr. Rick? - How do you do?

337
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,080
你已经认识的 第三帝国的哈斯先生
You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.

338
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,760
请一块坐 瑞克先生
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

339
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,920
今晚我们非常荣幸
We are very honored tonight.

340
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,260
第三帝国的名声 一部分是史查沙少校的功劳
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

341
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,400
他一直重复第三帝国 好像你预料会有别的一样
You repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others.

342
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,200
少校 私底下我会来者不拒
Well, personally, major, I will take what comes.

343
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,370
你介意我问你一些问题吗？
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

344
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,170
- 当然是非正式的  - 如果你喜欢 大可以正式地问
- Unofficially, of course. - Make it official if you like.

345
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,940
- 你的国籍是什么？- 我是个醉酒鬼
- What is your nationality? - I' m a drunkard.

346
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,540
那使瑞克成为世界公民
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world.

347
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,380
我在纽约市出生 如果这对你有帮助
I was born in New York City, if that'll help you any.

348
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,120
你在巴黎被占领时 从巴黎来到这里
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.

349
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,060
那似乎不是什么秘密
There seems to be no secret about that.

350
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,430
你是不是那种无法接受巴黎被德国人占领的人？
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

351
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,830
我没有特别钟情巴黎
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

352
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,900
你能想象我们占领伦敦吗？
Can you imagine us in London?

353
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,510
你到那里之后再问我吧
When you get there, ask me.

354
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,170
有外交手腕
Diplomatist.

355
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,500
那纽约呢？
How about New York?

356
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,550
在纽约有某些区域 我不会建议你尝试侵入
Well, there are sections of New York, major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

357
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,950
- 你认为谁会打胜仗？- 我一点也不清楚
- Who do you think will win the war? - I haven't the slightest idea.

358
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,780
瑞克对一切都采取中立态度 对女人也一样
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women too.

359
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,260
他并非一直那么小心保持中立 我们有你的完整档案
You were not always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.

360
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,260
"理查?宾勒 美国人 三十七岁 不能返回本国"
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37. Cannot return to his country."

361
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,000
原因有点含糊 我们也知道你在巴黎做什么
The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris.

362
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,930
也知道你为何离开巴黎 别担心 我们不会拿去广播
And also we know why you left Paris. Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

363
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,340
我的眼睛真的是棕色吗？
Are my eyes really brown?

364
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,740
请原谅我的好奇心 宾勒先生 重点是...
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is...

365
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,140
帝国的一位敌人已来到卡萨布兰卡
...an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca...

366
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,280
我们正查问任何能帮我们的人
...and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.

367
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,510
我对拉斯罗去留与否的兴趣 纯粹是因为赌博的关系
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

368
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,480
这样说来 你对奸诈的狐狸毫不同情
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox?

369
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,130
不特别同情 我也了解猎犬的立场
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound too.

370
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,330
维克多?拉斯罗在布拉格的报纸刊登最无耻的谎言
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers...

371
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,090
一直到我们进占那一天
...until the day we marched in.

372
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,600
甚至此后还他在地窖中继续印毁损的传单
And even after that, he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

373
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,470
当然 不得不承认他勇气可嘉
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.

374
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,840
我承认他很聪明 在巴黎他三次逃过我们的掌心
I admit he's clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers.

375
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,980
他继续他的活动 我们决意不让这种事再发生
In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.

376
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,590
对不起 你们的生意是政治 而我的生意是经营酒馆
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics, mine is running a saloon.

377
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,650
晚安 宾勒先生
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

378
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,790
你看到了 少校 你一点也不必担心瑞克
You see, major? You have nothing to worry about Rick.

379
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,560
或许吧
Perhaps.

380
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,690
什么需要效劳吗 先生？
Yes, Monsieur.

381
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,540
我订了一个位子 维克多?拉斯罗
I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.

382
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,670
是的 拉斯罗先生 这边走
Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

383
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,560
两杯"君度" 麻烦你
Two Cointreaux, please.

384
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,490
好的 先生

385
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,070
我没看到尤佳迪形容的人
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

386
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,330
维克多 我感觉我们不该留在这里
Victor, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.

387
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,470
如果我们现在走出去 只会引人注目
If we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us.

388
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
或许尤佳迪在咖啡馆的另一边
Perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the cafe.

389
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,340
对不起 你们像是正要前往美国的夫妇
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.

390
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,050
在那里 这戒指会有市场 我被迫卖掉它
You'll find a market there for this ring. I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

391
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,720
- 谢谢 我没想过买  - 也可以买给这位女士
- Thank you, but I hardly think... - Perhaps for the lady.

392
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,420
这戒指独一无二
The ring is quite unique.

393
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,220
- 好 我很感兴趣 - 很好
- Yes, I' m very interested. - Good.

394
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,790
你叫什么名字？
What is your name?

395
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,300
贝加 挪威人 听候差遣
Berger, Norwegian. At your service, sir.

396
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,870
维克多
Victor.

397
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,070
几分钟后 我在酒吧跟你会面
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.

398
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,830
我不想买戒指 谢谢你给我们看
We don't want the ring, but thanks for showing it to us.

399
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,070
- 那么便宜 你决定不买了？- 对不起 我决定了
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision? - I' m sorry, it is.

400
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,010
- 是拉斯罗先生吗？- 你是？
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not? - Yes?

401
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,190
我是雷诺队长 警察首长
I am Captain Renault, prefect of police.

402
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,550
你想要什么？
Yes, what is it you want?

403
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,850
欢迎你来到卡萨布兰卡 并祝你在这里住得愉快
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay.

404
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,750
我们并不常有这么特殊的访客
It isn't often we have so distinguished a visitor.

405
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,390
谢谢 我希望你原谅我 队长
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

406
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,050
目前的法国行政当局 并非一直那么友善
The present French administration hasn't always been so cordial.

407
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,170
容我介绍伊莎琳小姐
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

408
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,840
我听说你是卡萨布兰卡有史以来最美丽的女访客
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

409
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,800
那是粗略又保守的说法
That was a gross understatement.

410
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,260
你太客气了
You're very kind.

411
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,980
- 一起坐吧 - 谢谢
- Wort you join us? - If you will permit me.

412
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,940
艾米 给我一瓶最好的香槟 记在我的帐上
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your best champagne. And put it on my bill.

413
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,250
这是我们玩的一种游戏 他们记在帐单上
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,

414
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,490
我撕毁帐单 非常方便
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

415
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,420
队长 弹琴的那个人...
Captain, the boy who's playing the piano...

416
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,560
我好像在哪里看过
Somewhere I' ve seen him.

417
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,250
- 山姆？- 对
- Sam? - Yes.

418
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,190
他跟瑞克一起从巴黎来
He came from Paris with Rick.

419
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,830
瑞克？他是谁？
Rick? Who is he?

420
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
- 女士 你正在瑞克咖啡馆 瑞克是… - 他是什么？
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is... - Is what?

421
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,870
女士 他是那种... 如果我是女人的话...
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that, well, if I were a woman...

422
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,770
...我应该会爱上他
...and I were not around, I should be in love with Rick.

423
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,470
我真是个傻瓜 我对一位美丽女士说别的男人
But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.

424
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,970
失陪
Excuse me.

425
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,980
少校
Major.

426
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,650
林小姐 拉斯罗先生 这位是海米勒?史查沙少校
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Strasser.

427
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,810
你好
How do you do?

428
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,990
我盼望这份荣幸很久了
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.

429
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,720
我肯定你会原谅我不够亲切
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I' m not gracious.

430
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,060
史查沙少校 你知道我是捷克人
You see, Major Strasser, I am a Czechoslovakian.

431
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,320
你以前是捷克人 现在你是第三帝国统治下的人民
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

432
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,970
我从不曾接受这份优待 而现在我站在法国的土地上
I have never accepted that privilege. And I' m now on French soil.

433
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,970
我想跟你讨论一下 你在法国土地上引起的问题
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.

434
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,770
时间和地点都不太适当
This is hardly the time or place.

435
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,380
那我们另订时间和地点好了 明天十点在首长的办公室
Then we shall state another time and place. Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

436
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,810
还有这位小姐
With mademoiselle.

437
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,510
雷诺队长 我在你的管辖之下
Captain, I am under your authority.

438
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,720
到你的办公室是你的命令吗？
Is it your order that we come to your office?

439
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,830
当作是我的请求好了 这样的字眼比较好听
Let us say it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.

440
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,330
很好
Very well.

441
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,500
后会有期

442
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,530
很聪明的策略性让步 少校
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

443
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,840
- 这一次他们决意要阻止我   - 维克多 我很担心你
- This time they really mean to stop me. - Victor, I' m afraid for you.

444
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,910
我们以前也曾身处困境 不是吗？
We've been in difficult places before, haven't we?

445
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,150
我必须查出贝加知道的事
I must find out what Berger knows.

446
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,540
- 小心点 - 我会的 不用担心
- Be careful. - I will. Don't worry.

447
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,060
贝加先生 我可以再看看那戒指吗？
Monsieur Berger, the ring. Could I see it again?

448
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,230
请来一杯香槟鸡尾酒
Champagne cocktail, please.

449
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,800
我从报上的照片认得你的相貌 拉斯罗先生
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

450
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,950
在集中营里 想不消瘦也很难
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

451
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,080
我们看过五次报导你被杀死 在五个不同的地方
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.

452
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,150
每一次都是真实的
As you see, it was true every single time.

453
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,840
谢天谢地 我终于找到你 贝加
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

454
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,550
我在找一个叫尤佳迪的人 他预定是要帮我的
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

455
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,520
尤佳迪自身难保
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

456
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,930
他因谋杀罪被逮捕了 他今晚在这里被捕的
He's under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.

457
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,660
我明白了
I see.

458
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,160
不过我们还是自由之身 我们有组织 先生
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized.

459
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,600
在地下 就像其他地方一样
Underground, like everywhere else.

460
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,610
明天晚上有一个会议
Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois.

461
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,610
如果你来...
If you will come...

462
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,460
可否请弹钢琴的过来一下？
Will you ask the piano player to come over here?

463
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,760
好的 小姐
Very well, mademoiselle.

464
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,230
- 贝加 珠宝生意如何？ - 不太好 请替我结帐
- How's the jewelry business, Berger? - Not so good. Check, please.

465
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,890
真可惜你不早点来这里
Too bad you werert here earlier.

466
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,570
今天晚上我们有一点刺激 对不对 贝加？
We had quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

467
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,310
对 失陪
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

468
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,910
- 我的帐单  - 不用 两杯香槟鸡尾酒 拜托
- My bill. - No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

469
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,880
- 你好 山姆 - 你好 小姐
- Hello, Sam. - Hello, Miss llsa.

470
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,550
我从没想过会再看到你
I never expected to see you again.

471
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,890
很久不见了
It's been a long time.

472
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,060
是的 小姐 时间犹如流水一样不停地流逝
Yes, ma'am. Alot of water under the bridge.

473
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,930
- 弹一些旧日的歌 山姆 - 好的 小姐
- Some of the old songs, Sam. - Yes, ma'am.

474
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,010
瑞克在哪里？
Where is Rick?

475
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,110
我不知道 我整晚没看到他
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.

476
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,520
- 他什么时候回来？- 今晚他不会回来了
- When will he be back? - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

477
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,410
他回家了
He went home.

478
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,790
- 他常常这么早就走吗？- 他从不...
- Does he always leave so early?  - He never...

479
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,360
他有位女友在"蓝鹦鹉"
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

480
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,650
他常常去那儿
Goes up there all the time.

481
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,890
你以前比较会撒谎 山姆
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

482
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,470
别去打扰他 伊莎小姐 你会给他带来不幸
Leave him alone, Miss llsa. You're bad luck to him.

483
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,980
再弹一次 山姆 就当怀念过去
Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.

484
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,540
我不知道你是什么意思
I don't know what you mean, Miss llsa.

485
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,640
弹吧 山姆
Play it, Sam.

486
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,640
弹"时光飞逝"
Play "As Time Goes By."

487
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,210
我记不起来了 伊莎小姐 我有点生疏了
I can't remember it, Miss llsa. I'm a little rusty on it.

488
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,090
我替你哼调子
I'll hum it for you.

489
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,170
唱出来 山姆
Sing it, Sam.

490
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,080
山姆 我告诉过你永远别再弹这首曲子...
Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

491
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,700
你刚才问及瑞克 他来了 林小姐 让我来介绍...
Well, you were asking about Rick, and here he is. May I present...

492
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,200
- 你好 伊莎 - 你好 瑞克
- Hello, llsa. - Hello, Rick.

493
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,860
你已经认识瑞克了 小姐 或许你也...
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...

494
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,440
这位是拉斯罗先生
This is Mr. Laszlo.

495
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,010
- 你好 - 你好
- How do you do? - How do you do?

496
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,470
在卡萨布兰卡听到很多你的事
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

497
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,640
而维克多?拉斯罗的事到处可闻
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

498
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,970
- 跟我们喝一杯好吗？- 瑞克从不...
- Wort you join us for a drink? - Rick never...

499
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,010
- 可以 谢谢  - 呃...

500
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,120
...一项惯例打破了 艾米
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

501
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,380
- 这是很别致的咖啡馆 我恭喜你 - 我恭喜你
- Interesting cafe. I congratulate you. - I congratulate you.

502
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,080
- 为了什么？- 你的工作
- What for? - Your work.

503
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,990
谢谢 我尽力而为
Thank you. I try.

504
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,800
人家都尽力而为 而你成功了
We all try. You succeed.

505
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,850
我不太明白你们两个 瑞克 她早先在问关于你的事
I can't get the way you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick,

506
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,870
那种态度使我非常嫉妒
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

507
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,230
我不肯定是你
I wasrt sure you were the same.

508
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,870
- 我想想 我们最后一次见面是... - "美丽的晨晕"
- Let's see, the last time we met...  - Was La Belle Aurore.

509
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,380
太好了 你还记得
How nice. You remembered.

510
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,340
不过那天正好是德国军队开进巴黎的日子
But, of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

511
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,710
难以忘记的日子
Not an easy day to forget.

512
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,220
我记得每一个细节 德国人穿灰色 你穿蓝色
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

513
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,220
对 我把那件衣服收起来了
Yes. I put that dress away.

514
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,760
当德国人撤离后 我会再穿
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again.

515
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,060
瑞克 你变得较人性化了 我们必须感谢你
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that.

516
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,700
伊莎 我不想扫兴 不过时候不早了
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.

517
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,970
的确是 在卡萨布兰卡有戒严 警察首长可不能被发现...
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca. It would never do for the chief of police...

518
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,140
...喝醉酒神智不清
...to be found drinking after hours.

519
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,280
- 我希望你不介意 - 一点也不会
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome. - Not at all.

520
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,170
- 你的帐单 先生 - 我请客
- Your check, sir. - It 's my party.

521
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,940
又一个惯例打破了 这是一个很有趣的晚上
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening.

522
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,090
我替你叫计程车 在晚上汽油要配给
I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.

523
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,990
- 我们会再来 - 随时欢迎
- We'll come again. - Anytime.

524
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,220
- 替我跟山姆说晚安 - 我会的
- Say good night to Sam for me. - I will.

525
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,220
世界上没有人能像山姆那样弹"时光飞逝"
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

526
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,270
他有好久没弹这首歌了
He hasn't played it in a long time.

527
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,740
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

528
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,530
晚安
Night.

529
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,880
这个瑞克真叫人莫名其妙 他是什么人？
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick. What sort is he?

530
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,320
我也说不上来 虽然在巴黎 我常看到他
I really can't say, though I saw him quite often in Paris.

531
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,080
- 明天十点在首长的办公室 - 我们会去的
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office. - We'll be there.

532
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,950
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

533
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,290
老板？
Boss?

534
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,900
- 老板？- 什么事？
- Boss? - Yeah?

535
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,470
- 你要不要上床睡？- 现在不要
- Boss, ain't you going to bed? - Not right now.

536
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,610
你会在短时间内上床睡吗？
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?

537
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,900
- 晚一点你会上床睡吗？ - 不会
- You ever going to bed?  - No.

538
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,580
我也不困
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

539
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,940
好 来喝一杯吧
Good, then have a drink.

540
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,090
- 不 老板 - 那就别喝
- Not me, boss. - Then don't have a drink.

541
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,780
老板 我们离开这里吧
Boss, let's get out of here.

542
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,510
不 山姆 我在等一位女士
No, sir. I' m waiting for a lady.

543
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,290
拜托 我们走吧 这里除了麻烦 什么也没有
Please, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

544
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,500
她回来了 我知道她回来了
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.

545
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,360
我们开车去 开一整个晚上
We'll take the car and drive all night.

546
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,250
我们去喝酒 不醉不归
We'll get drunk.

547
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,400
我们也可以去钓鱼 躲开一下 直到她离开
We'll go fishing, stay away until she's gone.

548
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,940
- 闭嘴 回家去好吗？- 不 先生 我要留在这里
- Shut up and go home, will you? - No, sir, I' m staying right here.

549
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,940
他们抓了尤佳迪 然后她走进来
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

550
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,880
自然法则 一进一出
That's the way it goes. One in, one out.

551
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,110
- 山姆 - 是的 老板
- Sam. - Yes, boss?

552
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,750
在卡萨布兰卡 现在是1941年12月 在纽约是什么时候？
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?

553
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,350
什么？
What?

554
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,230
我的手表停了
My watch stopped.

555
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,260
我打赌 在纽约他们都睡着了
I bet they're asleep in New York.

556
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,200
我打赌 全美国的人都睡着了
I bet they're asleep all over America.

557
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,170
全世界有那么多城镇 有那么多酒吧
Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world...

558
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,340
她偏走进我这一家
...she walks into mine.

559
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,550
- 你在弹什么？- 我只是随便弹弹
- What's that you're playing? - A little something of my own.

560
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,520
- 停 你知道我想听什么 - 不 我不知道
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear. - No, I don't.

561
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,820
你能为她弹 也能为我弹
You played it for her. You can play it for me.

562
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,190
- 我想我记不起来...  - 如果她受得了 我也可以
- I don't think I can remember... - lf she can stand it, I can.

563
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,390
弹
Play it.

564
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,900
是的 老板
Yes, boss.

565
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,390
你到底是什么人？你以前是什么人？
Who are you really? And what were you before?

566
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,690
你是做什么的？你又想些什么？
What did you do, and what did you think?

567
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,230
我们说过不准问问题
We said no questions.

568
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,900
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

569
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,640
一法O买你的心事
A franc for your thoughts.

570
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,240
在美国他们只出一分钱
In America they'd bring only a penny.

571
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,650
我猜大概只值这么多
I guess that's about all they're won'th.

572
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,480
我愿意被超额收费 告诉我
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

573
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,910
我在想...
Well, I was wondering...

574
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,130
为什么我那么幸运？为什么你会在那里等着我出现？
Why I' m so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.

575
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,430
为什么我的生命中没有别的男人？
Why there is no other man in my life?

576
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,000
那很简单 以前有
That's easy. There was.

577
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,500
他死了
He's dead.

578
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,340
对不起
I'm sorry for asking.

579
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,410
我忘了我们说过不准问问题
I forgot we said no questions.

580
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,920
只有一个答案能解答我们所有的问题
Only one answer can take care of all our questions.

581
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,120
"巴黎"

582
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,480
这里是德国人史特格

583
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,420
法国人 巴黎人

584
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,050
法国军队已经放了弃他们的岗位

585
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,600
德国人已要求进入首都

586
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,830
现在什么也阻止不了他们了
Nothing can stop them now.

587
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,620
星期三 最迟星期四 他们便会来巴黎
Wednesday, Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

588
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,770
理查 如果他们发现你的记录 你留在这里便不安全了
Richard, they'll find out your record. You won't be safe here.

589
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,380
我早已在他们的黑名单上了
I'm on their blacklist already. Their roll of honor.

590
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,550
亨利要我们喝完这一瓶
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.

591
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,520
还有三瓶他要用来浇花 也不让德国人喝
Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.

592
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,990
这可以减轻被占领的苦恼 你说是不是？
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it?

593
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,430
你说对了
You said it.

594
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,570
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

595
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:29,140
(德语)

596
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,820
我的德语有点生疏了
My Germars a little rusty.

597
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,690
是秘密警察
It's the Gestapo.

598
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,470
他们说预计明天到巴黎
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.

599
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,110
他们在教我们 他们进来时该如何反应
They're telling us how to act when they come marching in.

600
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,380
整个世界快倒下来了 我们却挑这个时候来谈恋爱
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.

601
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,240
对 真不巧
It's pretty bad timing.

602
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,180
- 十年前 你会说什么？ - 十年前？
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago? - 10 years ago?

603
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,260
我想想看
Let's see.

604
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,390
我还带着牙套 那时候你在哪儿？
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?

605
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,520
正在找工作
Looking for a job.

606
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,730
那是炮火吗？
Was that cannon fire?

607
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,170
还是我的心在跳？
Or is it my heart pounding?

608
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,400
那是新型德国77 以声音来判断 大约只有35里远
It's the new German 77th, and judging by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

609
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,910
越来越近了
And getting closer every minute.

610
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,210
来 来 喝光
Here, here, drink up.

611
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,780
另外那三瓶我们喝不完了
We'll never finish the other three.

612
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,430
德国人很快就会到了 他们会来找你
Them Germans will be here pretty soon, and they'll come looking for you.

613
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,720
别忘了 拿下你有悬赏
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.

614
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,890
我在公寓留有字条 他们知道到哪里能找到我
Ileft a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me.

615
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,730
奇怪
It's strange.

616
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:58,340
- 我对你了解得那么少  - 我对你的了解更少
- I know so very little about you. - I know very little about you.

617
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,870
只知道你矫正过牙齿
Just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.

618
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,040
认真点 亲爱的 你有危险 你一定要离开巴黎
Be serious, darling. You are in danger. You must leave Paris.

619
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,370
不 我们一定要离开
No, we must leave.

620
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,780
对 当然是我们
Yes, of course. We.

621
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,710
开往马赛的火车五点出发 我四点半到饭店接你
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00. I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

622
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,920
不要在饭店 我…
Not at my hotel. I...

623
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,690
在我离开前 我在城里有事要办
I have things to do in the city before I leave.

624
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,920
我会在火车站跟你碰面
I'll meet you at the station.

625
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,320
好吧 四点四十五分
All right, at a quarter to 5.

626
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,390
我们何不在马赛结婚？
Why don't we get married in Marseilles?

627
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,770
现在计划不嫌太遥远吗？
That's too far ahead to plan.

628
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,740
对 我猜是远了点
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

629
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,730
那火车上的列车长如何？
Let's see... What about the engineer?

630
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,570
他可以在火车上替我们主持婚礼
Why can't he marry us on the train?

631
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,780
为什么不？船上的船长就可以 似乎有点不公平…
Why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that...

632
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,210
怎么了 亲爱的？
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

633
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,450
我那么爱你
I love you so much.

634
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,600
而我又那么痛恨这战争
And I hate this war so much.

635
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,300
这是个疯狂的世界 任何事都可能发生
It's a crazy world. Anything can happen.

636
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,910
万一如果你不能离开
If you shouldn't get away...

637
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,010
我是说 万一我们被分开...
If something should keep us apart...

638
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,810
...不管他们把你安置在哪里
...wherever they put you...

639
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,250
...不管我会在哪里 我要你知道我...
...and wherever I' II be, I want you to know that I...

640
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,090
吻我
Kiss me.

641
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,430
当做是最后一次吻我
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

642
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,300
上车! 上车!

643
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:46,370
注意! 上车!

644
00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:00,430
所有乘客上车 最后一班火车在三分钟后开出

645
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,400
快点 上车! 最后一班火车!

646
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,900
她在哪里？你有看到她吗？
Where is she? Have you seen her?

647
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,560
理查先生 我找不到她 她已经退了房间
I can't find her. She checked out of the hotel.

648
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,860
不过你刚离开后送来这字条
But this note came just after you left.

649
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,700
"亲爱的理查"

650
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,440
"我不能跟你走或是再见你"

651
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,880
"你不要问为什么"

652
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,470
"只要相信我爱你"

653
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,100
"给我的爱人 愿上帝祝福你"

654
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,440
"伊莎"

655
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,710
那是最后的召唤 理查先生
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

656
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,960
你听到我说吗？
Do you hear me?

657
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,630
快点 我们离开这里再说 快点 理查先生 快点
Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on.

658
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,080
瑞克 我必须跟你谈一下
Rick, I have to talk to you.

659
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,780
我把第一杯留下来跟你一起喝 在这儿
I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.

660
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,080
- 不 瑞克 今晚不行 - 特别是今晚
- No, Rick. Not tonight. - Especially tonight.

661
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,050
为什么你一定要来卡萨布兰卡 还有很多别的地方
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.

662
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,660
如果我知道你在这里 我就不会来
I wouldn't have come if I' d known you were here.

663
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,360
相信我 那是真的 我并不知道
Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.

664
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:49,930
奇怪的是你的声音 一点都没变 我仍然听得到
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

665
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,200
"亲爱的理查 我会随你到天涯海角"
"Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace.

666
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,040
- "我们一起坐上火车 一路不停" - 别这样 瑞克
- We'll get on a train and never stop." - Don't, Rick.

667
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,740
我明白你的感受
I can understand how you feel.

668
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,740
你明白我的感受
You understand how I feel.

669
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,210
我们相聚的日子有多长？
How long was it we had, honey?

670
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,350
- 我没有数 - 我有
- I didn't count the days. - Well, I did.

671
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,090
每一天都有
Every one of them.

672
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,660
最后一天我记得最清楚
Mostly I remember the last one.

673
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:16,420
当汽笛声响过后 月台上有一个人站在雨中...
The wild finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain...

674
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,320
...脸上挂着可笑的表情...
...with a comical look on his face...

675
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,470
...因为他的心被伤透了
...because his insides have been kicked out.

676
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,660
瑞克 我可否说一个故事给你听？
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

677
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,330
结局也有汽笛声吗？
Does it got a wild finish?

678
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,670
我还不知道结局
I don't know the finish yet.

679
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,280
那就说出来 或许可以一边说一边想
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come to you as you go along.

680
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:39,510
是有关一位女孩 她刚从科斯鲁来到巴黎
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo.

681
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,410
在一个朋友的家里...
At the house of some friends...

682
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,450
...她遇到她听闻了一辈子的男人
...she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life.

683
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,820
一个伟大又勇敢的男人
A very great and courageous man.

684
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,490
他为她揭开了一个由知识...
He opened up for her a whole beautiful world...

685
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,260
思想和理想组成的美丽世界
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

686
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:57,530
她知道的一切 她的成长 都是因为他
Everything she knew or ever became was because of him.

687
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,470
她景仰他...
And she looked up to him...

688
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,210
...崇拜他...
...and worshiped him...

689
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:04,210
...她假定那就是爱的感觉
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

690
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,500
对 很美
Yes, that's very pretty.

691
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,380
我也听过一个故事 事实上 我听过很多故事
I heard a story once. In fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

692
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,350
都由细小的钢琴叮叮声伴奏...
They went along with the sound of a tinny piano...

693
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,850
...就在楼下的大厅弹奏
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

694
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,320
"先生 我小时候遇上一个男人" 开始总是这样
"Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

695
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,430
我猜我们的故事都不怎么有趣
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny.

696
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,660
告诉我...
Tell me...

697
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,690
...你是为了谁离开我？
...who was it you left me for?

698
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,740
是拉斯罗 还是中间还有别的人...
Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between...

699
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,810
...或者你是不会说出来的人？
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

700
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,530
(雷诺队长 警察首长)

701
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,660
我怀疑尤佳迪把过境信函留给宾勒先生了
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

702
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:09,240
我建议立刻彻底搜查咖啡馆
I would suggest you search the cafe immediately.

703
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,430
如果信函在瑞克手上 他那么聪明 你不可能找到的
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart to let you find them there.

704
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,700
你夸大了他的聪明
You give him credit for too much cleverness.

705
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,510
我的印象里 他不过是一个莽撞的美国人
My impression was he's just another blundering American.

706
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,710
你不要低估美国人的莽撞
We mustrt underestimate American blundering.

707
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,850
1918年 当他们莽撞进入柏林时 我跟他们在一起
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.

708
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,920
至于拉斯罗 我要派人24小时监视
As to Laszlo, we want him watched 24 hours a day.

709
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:30,930
你可能会想知道 此刻他正在来这里的途中
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he's on his way here.

710
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,630
我们没办法
There is nothing we can do.

711
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,330
很高兴看到你们 你们有好好休息吗？
I'm delighted to see you. Did you have a good night's rest?

712
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,480
我睡得很好
I slept very well.

713
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,240
奇怪 在卡萨布兰卡 不应该有人会睡得好的
Strange. Nobody's supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.

714
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,410
- 我们可否进行正事？- 非常乐意 请坐
- May we proceed with the business? - With pleasure. Wort you sit down?

715
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,990
我们坦白说好了 你是第三帝国的逃犯
Laszlo, we will not mince words. You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

716
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,490
到目前为止 你成功躲过了我们
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us.

717
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,450
你抵达了卡萨布兰卡
You have reached Casablanca.

718
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,420
我有责任确保你留在卡萨布兰卡
It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.

719
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,720
问题是 你是否会成功
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic.

720
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,700
每张出境许可都需雷诺队长签名
Not at all. Renault 's signature is necessary on every visa.

721
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,560
队长 你认为拉斯罗可能获得出境证吗？
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa?

722
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,070
我恐怕不会 我表示抱歉 先生
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

723
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,300
或许我会喜欢留在卡萨布兰卡
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

724
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,640
那位小姐呢？
And mademoiselle?

725
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,300
- 你不必为我操心  - 你们想告诉我们的就是这些
- You needrt be concerned about me. - Is that all you wish to tell us?

726
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,450
别急 你的时间还有很多
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world.

727
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,280
你可能会无限期留在卡萨布兰卡
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

728
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,390
或许你也可以明天前往里斯本
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

729
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,750
- 不过有条件  - 什么条件？
- On one condition.  - And that is?

730
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:37,220
你知道各地的地下组织首领是谁 在巴黎 布拉格...
You know the leader of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague...

731
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,760
...布鲁赛尔 阿姆斯特丹...
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

732
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,230
..奥斯陆 贝尔格勒 雅典...
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

733
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,960
- 甚至在柏林 - 对 甚至在柏林
- Even Berlin. - Yes, even in Berlin.

734
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,800
如果你把他们的名字和行踪提供给我...
If you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts...

735
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,740
...你便可以在早上得到出境签证
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

736
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,670
并且分享为第三帝国服务的荣誉
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.

737
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,570
我在德国集中营待过一年
I was in a German concentration camp for a year.

738
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,870
那份荣誉够享用一辈子了
That's honor enough for a lifetime.

739
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,520
你会告诉我们那些名字吗？
You will give us the names?

740
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,540
如果在集中营时 我没有给你们...
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp...

741
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,690
...在那儿 你能随意用更有说服力的方法...
...where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal...

742
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,450
...现在我当然不会给你了
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

743
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,330
如果你查到名字杀了他们呢？
And what if you track down these men and kill them?

744
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,020
就算你把我们全部杀了 又能如何？
What if you murdered all of us?

745
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,600
在欧洲的每个角落 有上千人会站起来取代我们的位置
From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands would rise to take our places.

746
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,100
即使是纳粹党 也不能杀得完
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

747
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,760
拉斯罗 你以能言善辩著称 我现在体会到了
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand.

748
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,530
不过有一点你说错了
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

749
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,270
你说第三帝国所有的敌人都可以取代
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced.

750
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,970
不过有一个例外
But there is one exception.

751
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,810
没有人能取代你的位置...
No one could take your place if anything unfortunate...

752
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,890
...或防止在你逃走时发生的不幸
...should occur to you while you were trying to escape.

753
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:38,590
你不敢在这里阻挡我
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

754
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,280
这里仍然是未被占领的法国
This is still unoccupied France.

755
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,630
任何违法的举动都会影响雷诺队长的声誉
Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.

756
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,490
- 目前为止 仍然在我的控制中 - 谢谢
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power. - Thank you.

757
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,760
对了 先生 昨晚你表示对尤佳迪先生感兴趣
By the way, monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

758
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,270
我相信你有口信传给他
I believe you have a message for him?

759
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,700
没有什么重要的事 不过我现在可以跟他谈话吗？
Nothing important. But may I speak to him now?

760
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,240
你会发现谈话是单向的
You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided.

761
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,310
尤佳迪先生死了
Signor Ugarte is dead.

762
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,410
我正在写报告
I'm making out the report now.

763
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,180
我们还没决定他到底是自杀...
We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide...

764
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,730
...还是企图逃走时死去
...or died trying to escape.

765
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,060
- 你们问完了吗？ - 暂时问完了
- Are you quite finished with us?  - For the time being.

766
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,760
祝你有好的一天
Good day.

767
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,800
毫无疑问 他们下一步是找黑市
Undoubtedly, their next step will be to the black market.

768
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,000
对不起 队长
Excuse me, captain.

769
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:34,200
出现了另一件签证问题
Another visa problem has come up.

770
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,580
- 带她进来  - 是的
- Show her in. - Yes, sir.

771
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,280
对不起 先生 我们应付不了警察
Sorry, monsieur, we were never to handle the police.

772
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,230
- 这件事找法拉利先生才对  - 法拉利？
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.  - Ferrari?

773
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,590
认识法拉利会很有帮助
It can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari.

774
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,390
他独占了这里的黑市买卖
He pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here.

775
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,660
你去那边的蓝鹦鹉可以找到他
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

776
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,000
谢谢
Thanks.

777
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,250
不要太灰心
Don't be too downearted.

778
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:17,510
或许你可以与雷诺队长取得协议
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

779
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,020
谢谢 先生
Thank you very much, signor.

780
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,630
- 你好 法拉利  - 早上好 瑞克
- Hello, Ferrari. - Good morning, Rick.

781
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,950
我看到巴士到了 我把我买的货一起带走
The bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.

782
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,190
别急 我会叫人送去 跟我喝一杯吧
I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.

783
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,250
我在早上不喝酒的
I never drink in the morning.

784
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,600
每次你送给我的货 都少了一点
And every time you send my shipment over it's a little short.

785
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,740
搬运费
Carrying charges, my boy. Carrying charges.

786
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,200
来 坐下
Here, sit down.

787
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,030
反正我有些事情要跟你谈
There is something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.

788
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,840
"波旁"威士忌
Bourbon.

789
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:41,050
尤佳迪的新闻使我很不舒服
The news about Ugarte upsets me very much.

790
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,410
你是个肥肿的虚伪者 尤佳迪的死 你不会比我难过多少
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

791
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,610
当然 我难过的是尤佳迪死了...
Of course not. What upsets me is that Ugarte is dead...

792
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,810
...没有人知道那过境信在哪里
...and no one knows where those letters are.

793
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,290
没有人知道
Practically no one.

794
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,750
如果我得到 肯定可以赚一大笔
If I had those letters, I could make a fortune.

795
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:56,090
我也可以 我是个贫穷的生意人
So could I, and I' m a poor businessman.

796
00:55:56,290 --> 00:56:00,130
不管在谁手上 我给他一个建议
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I' II handle the entire transaction.

797
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,170
我来安排交易 承担一切风险 把信卖出去
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.

798
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:04,860
提成一部分利润和搬运费？
And the carrying charges?

799
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,800
自然会有一些意外支出
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses.

800
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,910
这是我对持有信函的人的提议
That's my proposition for whoever has those letters.

801
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,630
他出现时 我会告诉他
I'll tell him when he comes in.

802
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,440
我开门见山说吧 我认为你知道那些信在哪里
Rick, I think you know where those letters are.

803
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,910
雷诺和史查沙大概也这样想
You're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

804
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,650
所以我才到这里 给他们机会搜索我的店
That's why I came here. To give them a chance to ransack my place.

805
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,160
别傻了 跟我说实话 你需要一个合伙人
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

806
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,260
失陪 我要回去了
Excuse me, I' II be getting back.

807
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:40,600
- 早上好  - 法拉利就是那边桌子旁的胖子
- Morning. - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

808
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,910
在全摩洛哥 你也找不到这么珍贵的东西
You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco.

809
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,410
只要七百法O
Only 700 francs.

810
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,780
- 你被骗了  - 没关系 谢谢
- You're being cheated. - Doesrt matter, thank you.

811
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,080
女士是瑞克的朋友 我们给一点折扣
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount.

812
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,810
我刚才说七百法O吗？两百法O卖给你
Did I say 700 francs? You can have it for 200.

813
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,650
对不起 昨晚你来时 我正处于不适合待客的状态
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.

814
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,820
没关系
Doesrt matter.

815
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,930
瑞克的特别朋友 我们有特别的折扣 一百法O
For special friends of Rick's we have a special discount. 100 francs.

816
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,130
那故事把我弄糊涂了 或者是喝多了"波旁"吧
Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.

817
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,930
我有些桌巾 一些餐巾...
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

818
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,800
- 谢谢 我真的不感兴趣  - 请等一会儿
- Thank you. I' m really not interested. - Please, one minute.

819
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,930
为什么你要回来呢？
Why did you come back?

820
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,600
为了告诉我 你为何让我在火车站白等？
To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?

821
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,800
对
Yes.

822
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,350
你现在可以告诉我 我比较清醒了
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.

823
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,110
我想我不会说了 瑞克
I don't think I will, Rick.

824
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,580
为何不？我买了火车票进退两难 我想我有权利知道
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I' m entitled to know.

825
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,950
昨晚我看到在你身上发生了什么
Last night I saw what has happened to you.

826
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,860
在巴黎的瑞克 我可以告诉他 他能够明白
The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him, he'd understand.

827
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,590
可是用那种怨恨眼光看我的人...
But the one who looked at me with such hatred...

828
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:43,160
我很快就会离开这里 我们永远也不会再见了
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see each other again.

829
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,360
我们在巴黎相爱的时候 我们彼此了解并不多
We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris.

830
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,340
如果我们维持那样 或许我们会记住那些日子
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca.

831
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:54,940
不是昨晚
Not last night.

832
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,850
你舍我而去 是因为你知道受不了？
Did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like?

833
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,920
逃避警察 无时无刻不在逃亡？
Hiding from the police, running away all the time?

834
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:03,780
如果你要相信是那样 随便你
You can believe that if you want to.

835
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,720
我已不再逃亡了 我安定下来了
Well, I' m not running away anymore. I'm settled now.

836
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,690
虽然是酒馆 不过是事实...
Above a saloon, it's true...

837
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,330
...要上飞机的话...
...but walk up a flight...

838
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,220
...我会算你一份
...I' II be expecting you.

839
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,100
都一样 有一天你会对拉斯罗撒谎
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

840
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,000
你会去的
You'll be there.

841
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,560
不 瑞克
No, Rick.

842
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,240
不 维克多?拉斯罗是我丈夫
No. You see, Victor Laszlo is my husband.

843
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,840
以前也是 甚至我在巴黎认识你之前也是
And was, even when I knew you in Paris.

844
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,980
我刚才正跟拉斯罗先生说 很不幸我无法帮助你们
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I' m not able to help him.

845
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,060
是这样的 亲爱的 话已传开了
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

846
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,910
身为卡萨布兰卡所有非法活动的领导人
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca,

847
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:45,820
我是个有影响力和受尊重的人
I am influential and respected.

848
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,430
并不值得冒生命危险为拉斯罗先生做事
But it would not be won'th my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

849
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,430
不过你却是另一回事
You, however, are a different matter.

850
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:56,240
法拉利先生认为有可能替你拿到一份签证
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.

851
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,800
- 你是说让我单独离开 - 只能单独一人
- You mean for me to go on alone? - And only alone.

852
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,280
我会留在这里继续想办法 我肯定再过一阵子...
I'll stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while...

853
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,250
我还是坦白一点好 先生
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

854
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,120
你需要奇迹才可能离开卡萨布兰卡
It would take a miracle to get you out of Casblanca.

855
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,880
而德国人是剥夺奇迹的歹徒
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

856
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,480
我们只对两份签证感兴趣
We are only interested in two visas.

857
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,920
- 拜托 伊莎 不要急躁  - 不 维克多
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty. - No, Victor.

858
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,350
你们两位会想讨论这件事
You two will want to discuss this.

859
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,500
失陪 我会在酒吧
Excuse me. I' II be at the bar.

860
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,160
不 伊莎 我不能让你留在这里
No, llsa. I won't let you stay here.

861
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:27,700
你必须到美国去 我相信我终会逃出 跟你会合
You must get to America. Believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.

862
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,740
维克多 情况不一样
But if the situation were different...

863
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,470
如果我必须留下 只有一份签证
...if I had to stay and there were only visa for one...

864
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,940
你会要吗？
...would you take it?

865
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,240
对 我会
Yes, I would.

866
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:38,640
对 我明白
Yes, I see.

867
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,900
当要离开"流尔" 我遇上了麻烦
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,

868
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,720
你为什么不把我留在那儿？
why didn't you leave me there?

869
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,920
当我在马赛生病时 耽搁你两个星期
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks

870
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,950
你无时无刻不冒着生命危险
and you were in danger every minute...

871
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,920
那时候你为什么不留下我？
...why didn't you leave me then?

872
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,720
我本来要 总是有些东西阻止我
I meant to, but something always held me up.

873
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,670
我非常爱你 伊莎
Ilove you very much, llsa.

874
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,960
我会保守你的秘密
Your secret will be safe with me.

875
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,130
法拉利在等我们的答案
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

876
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,640
不能超过五十法O
Not more than 50 francs.

877
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,180
我们已经决定了 法拉利先生
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

878
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,720
从现在起我们只寻求两份签证 非常感谢你
For the present we will go on looking for two visas. Thank you very much.

879
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:18,860
祝你好运 务必小心
Well, good luck, but be careful.

880
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,860
- 你知道你被跟踪吗？- 当然 已经习以为常
- You know you're being shadowed? - Of course. It becomes an instinct.

881
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,220
我发现在某方面来说 你是个幸运的人
I observe that you, in one respect, are a very fortunate man.

882
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,130
我想再给你一个建议 为了什么我也不知道
I am moved to make one more suggestion. Why, I do not know.

883
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,200
因为你不可能给我好处
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

884
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,570
你有听闻尤佳迪先生和过境信吗？
Have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit?

885
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,730
一点点
Yes, something.

886
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,100
他们逮捕尤佳迪时 没有在他身上找到那些信
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.

887
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,270
- 你知道信在哪里吗？ - 不确定
- You know where they are? - Not for sure.

888
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,500
不过我猜尤佳迪把信留给了瑞克先生
But I' d guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

889
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:46,790
瑞克有难以理解的习惯
A difficult customer, that Rick.

890
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,610
没有人知道他会做什么及为什么
One never knows what he'll do or why.

891
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,450
不过值得试一试
But it is won'th a chance.

892
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,820
非常感谢你
Thank you very much. Good day.

893
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:55,860
再见 谢谢你的咖啡
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

894
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,760
我们离开卡萨布兰卡后 我会想念它的
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

895
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,800
谢谢你跟我分享
Gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, mademoiselle.

896
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:03,400
- 先生  - 祝你有好的一天
- Monsieur. - Good day.

897
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:14,440
- 敬你 先生 - 祝你好运
- Here's to you, sir. - Good luck.

898
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,780
- 我要走了  - 请给我帐单
- I' d better be going. - My check, please.

899
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,710
我必须警告你 先生 这是个危险的地方
I have to warn you, sir. This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

900
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,750
- 到处是贪心的人  - 再见
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything. - Goodbye.

901
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,550
很荣幸认识你
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

902
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,390
对不起
I'm sorry.

903
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,940
瑞克先生 你快成为自己最好的顾客了
Monsieur Rick, you are getting to be your best customer.

904
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,350
在喝酒？你使我很高兴
Well, drinking. I'm very pleased with you.

905
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,420
你现在开始像法国人那样生活了
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman.

906
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,950
你的手下今天下午来搅乱我的店
That was some going-over your men gave my place.

907
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,110
我们差点来不及开门营业
We barely got cleaned up in time to open.

908
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,550
我告诉过史查沙不会在这里找到那些信
I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here.

909
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:02,850
不过我告诉我的手下要格外有破坏力
But I told my men to be especially destructive.

910
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,960
那可以使德国人刮目相看
You know how that impresses Germans.

911
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,600
瑞克 你有那些过境信吗？
Rick, have you got those letters of transit?

912
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,060
你是倾向亲德还是自由法国？
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy or Free French?

913
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:16,160
我活该问这直接的问题 这话题结束
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.

914
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,940
似乎你晚了一步
It looks like you're a little late.

915
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,910
原来伊娃向敌人投诚了
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

916
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,850
谁知道 以她自己的方法 她可能组织第二条前线
Who knows? In her own way, she may constitute an entire second front.

917
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:35,750
我想我该去奉承一下史查沙少校 回头见 瑞克
I think it's time for me to flatter Strasser a little. I' II see you later.

918
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,030
沙克
Sascha!

919
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,220
法国七十五
French 75s.

920
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:43,090
我们要一整排 沙克 从这里开始 到这里结束
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha. Starting here and ending here.

921
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:44,600
我们从两杯开始
We will begin with two.

922
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,060
你不是法国人吗？

923
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:52,040
- 竟然跟这种德国人约会  - 关你什么事

924
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,870
你说什么？麻烦你再说一次
What did you say? Would you kindly repeat it?

925
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,450
- 我说什么与你无关  - 我会使它变成跟我有关
- What I said is none of your business. - I' II make it my business.

926
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:04,790
停手! 求求你 求求你停手

927
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,290
我不喜欢人家在我的店里乱来 不抛开政治就滚出去
I don't like disturbances in my place. Either lay off politics or get out.

928
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,720
有一天 你会得到报应的

929
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,220
你看到了吧 队长？
You see, captain?

930
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,870
情况并不如你想得那么稳定
The situation is not as under control as you believe.

931
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,930
亲爱的少校 我们正尽量跟贵政府合作
We try to cooperate with your government.

932
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,400
我们无法规定人民的感受
But we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.

933
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,740
队长 你完全肯定你帮那一边吗？
Captain, are you certain which side you're on?

934
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,200
我没有信念 如果你指这一方面
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean.

935
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:28,710
我看风转舵
I blow with the wind...

936
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,280
目前的风向正巧从维琪(亲德)吹来
...and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.

937
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,180
如果风向改了呢？
And if it should change?

938
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,610
我肯定帝国不会承认那种可能性
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility?

939
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:37,880
我们关心的不只是卡萨布兰卡
We are concerned about more than Casablanca.

940
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,490
我们知道 每个在非洲的法国管区都布满了叛徒
We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

941
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:44,690
正在等候机会 或许在等候一位领导人
Waiting for their chance. Waiting perhaps for a leader.

942
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,420
领导人？像拉斯罗？
Aleader? Like Laszlo?

943
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,400
我一直在想
I have been thinking.

944
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,030
让他离开太危险 但让他留下也可能太危险
It's too dangerous to let him go, it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

945
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,190
我明白你的意思
I see what you mean.

946
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,080
(德语)

947
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,980
谢谢 卡尔
Thank you, Carl.

948
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,410
谢谢 卡尔
Thank you, Carl.

949
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,550
卡尔 坐下 跟我们喝杯白兰地
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

950
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,320
庆祝我们明天到美国去
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow.

951
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:09,580
非常谢谢
Thank you very much.

952
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,520
我早想到你会请我喝 所以我拿了上等的白兰地
I thought you would ask me, so I brought the good brandy...

953
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,560
还有高脚杯
...and a third glass.

954
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,720
这一天终于到来了
At last the day's came!

955
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,730
从现在起我们只说英文
Frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now.

956
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,770
这样我们到美国后 会感觉像回到家一样
So we should feel at home when we get to America.

957
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,600
很不错的主意
A very nice idea.

958
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,160
为美国喝一杯
To America.

959
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,930
为美国喝一杯
To America.

960
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:36,910
几点了？
What watch?

961
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,770
- 十点  - 这么晚了
- Ten watch. - Such much?

962
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,750
你们会在美国过得非常愉快
You will get along beautifully in America.

963
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,520
幸运女神有没有照顾你？
How is lady luck treating you?

964
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,560
真可惜
Oh, too bad.

965
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,760
他就在那边
You'll find him over there.

966
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,530
- 瑞克先生  - 是
- Monsieur Rick? - Yes?

967
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
我可否跟你说几句话？求求你
Could I speak to you, please?

968
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:02,940
你怎么进来的？你还未成年
How'd you get in here? You're underage.

969
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,440
- 我跟雷诺队长一起来的  - 我早该猜到
- I came with Captain Renault. - I should have known.

970
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,940
我丈夫也跟我一起
My husband is with me too.

971
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,880
是吗？雷诺队长思想越来越开明了
He is? Captain Renault 's getting broad-minded. Sit down.

972
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,040
要喝一杯吗？
Have a drink?

973
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,910
当然不喝 你介意我喝吗？
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

974
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,580
瑞克先生...
Monsieur Rick...

975
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:19,880
- 雷诺队长是怎样的人？- 就像其他的男人 或者更像...
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?  - Like any other man, only more so.

976
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:21,050
我是说...
No, I mean...

977
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:23,050
他值得信任吗？他的话...？
...is he trustwon'thy? Is his word...?

978
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:27,360
- 等一下 谁叫你来问我的？ - 雷诺队长叫我来的
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that? - He did. Captain Renault did.

979
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,590
我也猜到了 你的丈夫呢？
I thought so. Where's your husband?

980
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:34,130
在轮盘桌那边 想要赢足够的钱 买我们的出境证
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visas.

981
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,100
当然他正在输钱
Oh, of course he's losing.

982
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,240
- 你们结婚多久了？- 八个星期
- How long have you been married? - Eight weeks.

983
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,910
我们从保加利亚来
We come from Bulgaria.

984
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,740
那里的情况非常坏 先生
Things are very bad there.

985
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,110
魔鬼押着人民的脖子
The devil has the people by the throat.

986
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,040
所以犹安和我 我们...
So Jan and I, we...

987
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,920
我们不想子女在那种地方长大
We do not want our children to grow up in such a country.

988
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,490
- 所以你们决定去美国  - 对
- So you decided to go to America. - Yes.

989
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,060
可是我们钱不多...
But we haven't much money...

990
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,700
...旅费那么贵而且困难
...and traveling is so expensive and difficult.

991
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,120
来这里的花费比我们预算高很多
It was much more than we thought to get here.

992
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,670
然后雷诺队长看到我们...
And then Captain Renault sees us...

993
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,840
- 他很仁慈 他想帮我们 - 对 我敢打赌
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us. - Yes, I' II bet.

994
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,200
他告诉我 他可以给我们出境签证
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

995
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,010
可是 我们没有钱
But we have no money.

996
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,900
- 他知道吗？- 知道
- Does he know that? - Yes.

997
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,410
- 那他仍然愿意给你签证？- 对 先生
- And he's still willing to give you a visa? - Yes.

998
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:21,550
- 而你想知道...？- 他会不会遵守诺言？
- And you want to know...? - Will he keep his word?

999
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:23,750
他一直都是
He always has.

1000
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,950
你是一个男人
You are a man.

1001
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:33,790
假设有一个人非常爱你...
If someone loved you very much...

1002
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,230
...她只求能给你快乐...
...so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world...

1003
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,670
...为了肯定能办到 她做了件坏事...
...and she did a bad thing to make certain of it...

1004
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,270
- 你会不会原谅她？- 没有人曾经那么爱我
- ...could you forgive her? - Nobody ever loved me that much.

1005
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,280
他一直都不知道 那女孩把做过的坏事藏在心里
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart...

1006
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,240
这样不会有关系吧 会不会？
...that would be all right, wouldn't it?

1007
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,540
- 你要我提意见吗？- 是的 请说
- You want my advice? - Yes, please.

1008
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,140
回到保加利亚去
Go back to Bulgaria.

1009
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,620
如果你知道能离开欧洲到美国 对我们有多重要
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America...

1010
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,950
如果犹安发现了 他那么孩子气
Oh, but if Jan should find out. He is such a boy.

1011
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,570
在很多方面 我比他成熟
In many ways I am so much older than he is.

1012
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,130
在卡萨布兰卡 每个人都有困难
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems.

1013
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:14,460
- 你的困难可能会解决的 失陪  - 谢谢你
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me. - Thank you, monsieur.

1014
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,480
- 晚安  - 晚安
- Good evening. - Good evening.

1015
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:28,180
- 你看 我们又来了 - 我认为那是对山姆的恭维
- You see? Here we are again. - I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

1016
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:31,580
我猜对你而言 他代表巴黎那些较快乐的日子
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days.

1017
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,320
的确是 我们可否选择靠近他的桌子
He does. Could we have a table close to him?

1018
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:37,860
并且离史查沙少校越远越好
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.

1019
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,690
这样的安排可能有点困难
The geography may be a little difficult to arrange.

1020
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,630
- 保罗 三十号桌  - 是的 先生
- Paul, table 30.  - Yes, sir.

1021
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,600
请往这边
Right this way, if you please.

1022
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:48,540
我叫山姆弹"时光飞逝" 我相信那是你偏爱的曲子
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By." I believe that's your favorite tune.

1023
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,040
谢谢
Thank you.

1024
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,080
- 两杯干邑 麻烦你  - 干邑
- Two cognacs, please. - Cognac.

1025
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,850
下注 先生女士

1026
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,450
赌博游戏继续进行

1027
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,550
先生女士 下注

1028
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:20,800
游戏继续 下注

1029
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,740
先生 你要不要再下注？
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

1030
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,010
不 我想不要了
No. No, I guess not.

1031
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:32,050
你今晚买过22号吗？
Have you tried 22 tonight?

1032
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,020
我说22
I said 22.

1033
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:42,030
下注 先生女士 游戏继续

1034
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,390
好了 二十二!

1035
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,190
二十二

1036
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,700
留在那里
Leave it there.

1037
01:08:55,740 --> 01:09:03,810
下注 先生女士 游戏继续进行

1038
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,650
好了 不要下注 二十二

1039
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:09,550
拿去兑现金 不要再回来
Cash it in and don't come back.

1040
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,310
你肯定这地方诚实吗？
Are you sure this place is honest?

1041
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:18,730
诚实？日子有多长 就有多诚实
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

1042
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,630
不要再下注了

1043
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,000
我们今天成绩如何？
How are we doing tonight?

1044
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,000
比我预料的少了几千块
A couple of thousand less than I thought there would be.

1045
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:31,680
瑞克先生...
Monsieur Rick...

1046
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,340
他走运而已
He's just a lucky guy.

1047
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,950
瑞克先生 我倒杯咖啡给你好吗？
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?

1048
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,180
- 不用了 谢谢你 卡尔  - 瑞克先生
- No, thanks, Carl. - Monsieur Rick...

1049
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,180
雷诺队长 我可否...？
Captain Renault, may I...?

1050
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,320
在这里不行 明早到我办公室 我们依照手续
Not here. Come to my office in the morning. We'll do everything businesslike.

1051
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,230
- 我们会在六点到  - 我会在十点到
- We'll be there at 6. - I' II be there at 10.

1052
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,270
我很替你们高兴
I'm very happy for both of you.

1053
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,530
你赢钱有一点奇怪
Still, it's very strange that you won.

1054
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,970
或许不是那么奇怪
Well, maybe not so strange.

1055
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,980
- 明天早上见  - 太感谢谢你了 雷诺队长
- I' II see you in the morning. - Thank you, Captain Renault.

1056
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,970
是真的吗？
No!

1057
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,590
老板 你做了一件天大的好事
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1058
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,790
走开 疯狂的俄国人
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1059
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,560
正如我所料 你是个不折不扣的感情用事者
As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.

1060
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,500
是吗？为什么？
Yeah? Why?

1061
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,870
为什么你干扰我小小的罗曼史？
Why do you interfere with my little romances?

1062
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,910
就算是向爱情致敬吧
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1063
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,600
这一次我原谅你
Well, I' II forgive you this time.

1064
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:44,650
不过明天晚上 我会带来一位令人窒息的金发美女
But I' II be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond.

1065
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,010
如果她输钱 会令我非常高兴
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

1066
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:54,220
- 宾勒先生 不晓得可否跟你谈谈  - 说吧
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you. - Go ahead.

1067
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,020
有别的说话的地方吗？
Well, isn't there some other place?

1068
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,720
我要说的是很机密的事
It's rather confidential, what I have to say.

1069
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,930
- 去我办公室  - 好的
- In my office. - Right.

1070
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,660
你一定知道离开卡萨布兰卡对我很重要
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.

1071
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,830
身为这伟大运动的领导人之一 是一份莫大的荣幸
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement.

1072
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,770
你知道我一直从事什么
You know what I' ve been doing.

1073
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,880
你知道 对全世界 对千百万人的生命 那有多重要
You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands of people...

1074
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,310
如果我能到美国继续我的工作
...that I reach America and continue my work.

1075
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,920
我对政治不感兴趣
I'm not interested in politics.

1076
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,580
世界的问题不是我份内的事
The problems of the world are not in my department.

1077
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,950
我是开酒馆的
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1078
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:27,850
我从事地下工作的朋友告诉我 你有不平凡的纪录
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record.

1079
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,550
你运枪械到衣索比亚
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1080
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,590
- 你在西班牙对抗法西斯  - 那又怎样？
- You fought against the fascists in Spain. - What of it?

1081
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,930
你总是帮受迫害的那边打仗 不是有点奇怪吗？
Isn't it strange you're always fighting on the side of the underdog?

1082
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,070
对 我发现那是种昂贵的喜好
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

1083
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,500
不过我那时候不太会做生意
But then I never was much of a businessman.

1084
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:44,040
现在你是否较会做生意 晓得十万法O这价码
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1085
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:47,080
- 我欣赏 可是我不接受  - 我加到二十万
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it. - 200,000.

1086
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,970
朋友 你可以加到一百万或三百万
My friend, you could make it a million francs or three.

1087
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,980
我的答案仍然一样
My answer would still be the same.

1088
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:54,310
一定有原因使你不愿意给我
There must be some reason why you won't let me.

1089
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,640
是有
There is.

1090
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,250
我建议你去问你的妻子
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1091
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,180
- 你说什么？- 我说问你的妻子
- I beg your pardon? - I said, ask your wife.

1092
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,960
- 我的妻子？- 对
- My wife?  - Yes.

1093
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:09,690
(德国歌)

1094
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,360
吹奏"马赛曲"  快
Play "La Marseillaise." Play it!

1095
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:50,620
法国万岁 民主万岁

1096
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,200
你明白我的意思了吧？
See what I mean?

1097
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,410
如果拉斯罗在咖啡馆可以鼓动这样的示威行动
If Laszlo 's presence in a cafe can inspire this demonstration...

1098
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,050
他在卡萨布兰卡 还会导致什么？
...what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on?

1099
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,210
我奉劝把这地方马上查封
I advise that this place be shut up at once.

1100
01:14:11,490 --> 01:14:14,460
- 可是大家都那么开心  - 对 太开心了
- But everybody's having a good time. - Yes, much too good a time.

1101
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,820
这地方必须查封
The place is to be closed.

1102
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:19,050
- 可是我没有借口查封  - 找一个
- But I have no excuse to close it. - Find one.

1103
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,390
祝健康! 先生 健康

1104
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,600
所有人必须马上离开
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1105
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,070
这咖啡馆关闭 直到另行通知为止
This cafe is closed until further notice.

1106
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,900
马上清场
Clear the room at once.

1107
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,710
你怎么可以查封我 有什么理由？
How can you close me up?

1108
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,370
我很震惊 发现这里进行赌博
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here.

1109
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,450
- 你赢的钱 先生  - 谢谢你
- Your winnings, sir. - Thank you.

1110
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,880
所有人马上出去
Everybody out at once.

1111
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,260
经过这次骚动 拉斯罗在卡萨布兰卡已不再安全
After this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1112
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,230
今早你暗示他离开卡萨布兰卡 并不安全
This morning you implied it wasrt safe to leave Casablanca.

1113
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,330
不错 除了一处目的地 回到被占领的法国
That is also true, except for one destination: Occupied France.

1114
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,440
- 被占领的法国？- 在我的安全保证下
- Occupied France? - Under safe conduct from me.

1115
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:00,660
一文不值
Of what value is that?

1116
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:03,860
你可能记得过去德国的信誉值多少钱吧
You may recall what German guarantees have been won'th in the past.

1117
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,310
- 你只有两个选择  - 是什么？
- There are two other alternatives for him. - What are they?

1118
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,780
法国当局有可能会找个理由把他送进这儿的集中营
The French authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

1119
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,040
另一个选择呢？
The other alternative?

1120
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:17,980
或许你已经察觉在卡萨布兰卡人命不值钱
My dear, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1121
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,490
晚安 小姐
Good night, mademoiselle.

1122
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,690
- 瑞克怎么回事？- 我们待会儿再商量
- What happened with Rick? - We'll discuss it later.

1123
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,620
我们忠心的朋友仍然在那里
Our faithful friend is still there.

1124
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,690
维克多 求你今晚不要去地下会议
Please don't go to the underground meeting tonight.

1125
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,020
我一定要去
I must.

1126
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,660
况且一个男人能在妻子面前扮演英雄的机会不多
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife.

1127
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,170
不要开玩笑 经过史查沙少校今晚的警告后 我很害怕
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I' m frightened.

1128
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:12,210
告诉你事实 我也害怕
Tell you the truth, I'm frightened too.

1129
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,810
我应该留在这里？躲在饭店房间？
Shall I remain here in a hotel room, hiding?

1130
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,640
或者我应该继续尽力而为？
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1131
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:19,710
不管我说什么 你也会继续做
Whatever I' d say, you would carry on.

1132
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:23,520
维克多 为何你不告诉我瑞克的事 你发现了什么？
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?

1133
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:26,050
- 很明显那些信在他手上  - 还有呢？
- Apparently he has the letters. - Yes?

1134
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,780
可是没有要卖的意思
But no intention of selling them.

1135
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,660
一般人会以为情感不能打动他 钱应该可以
You'd think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1136
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,390
他有没有告诉你理由是什么？
Did he give any reason?

1137
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,860
- 他建议我问你  - 问我？
- He suggested I ask you. - Ask me?

1138
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:39,230
对 他说: "问你的妻子"
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1139
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,970
我不知道他为什么那样说
I don't know why he said that.

1140
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,250
我们外头那位朋友 现在应该以为我们休息了
Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now.

1141
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,450
我待会儿就去
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1142
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:05,020
- 伊莎 我…  - 什么？
- Ilsa, I... - Yes?

1143
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,560
我在集中营的时候...
When I was in the concentration camp...

1144
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,660
...你在巴黎寂寞吗？
...were you lonely in Paris?

1145
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,130
对 维克多 我是寂寞
Yes, Victor, I was.

1146
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:19,080
我知道寂寞是什么样子
I know how it is to be lonely.

1147
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,480
你有什么事想要告诉我吗？
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1148
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,470
没有 维克多
No, Victor, there isn't.

1149
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,650
我非常爱你 亲爱的
Ilove you very much, my dear.

1150
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,990
我知道
Yes, I know.

1151
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,260
维克多 不管我做什么 你会不会相信我？
Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I...?

1152
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,130
你甚至不必说出来
You don't even have to say it.

1153
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,070
我也相信你
I'll believe.

1154
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,500
晚安 亲爱的
Good night, dear.

1155
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:53,840
晚安
Good night.

1156
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,550
- 维克多 - 什么事 亲爱的？
- Victor. - Yes, dear?

1157
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,220
要小心
Be careful.

1158
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,390
当然 我会小心
Of course I' II be careful.

1159
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,940
你的情况非常好 瑞克先生
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1160
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,910
我可以支持多久不营业？
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1161
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,880
两星期或者三星期
Two weeks, maybe three.

1162
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,310
或者我不必关门 以前用贿赂有效
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before.

1163
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,750
目前所有人依旧发薪水
In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.

1164
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,280
谢谢 瑞克先生
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1165
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:13,820
沙克听到一定很高兴 我欠他钱
Sascha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.

1166
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:17,220
- 你把门锁好 可以吗？- 我会的
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl - I will.

1167
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:20,520
- 然后我要去开会… - 别告诉我你去哪里
- Then I am going to the meeting... - Don't tell me where you're going.

1168
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,890
好
I won't.

1169
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,130
晚安
Good night.

1170
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:26,860
晚安 瑞克先生
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1171
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,920
- 你怎么进来的？- 街外的楼梯
- How did you get in? - The stairs from the street.

1172
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,650
今天早上我跟你说有空来坐
I told you this morning you'd come around,

1173
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,420
不过这似乎比预定的稍早了点
but this is ahead of schedule.

1174
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,820
你不坐下来吗？
Well, won't you sit down?

1175
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:55,930
- 理查 我必须见你  - 再度叫理查 我们回到巴黎了
- Richard, I had to see you. - "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1176
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,400
你的突然来访是否有可能跟那些过境信有关呢？
Your visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit?

1177
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,300
似乎只要信一天还在我手上 我就不愁寂寞了
Seems as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.

1178
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:05,100
你要多少钱都可以 不过你一定要把那些信给我
Ask any price you want, but you must give me the letters.

1179
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,840
我已经跟你的丈夫讲清楚了 绝不交易
I went all through that with your husband. It 's no deal.

1180
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,140
我知道你对我的感受...
I know how you feel about me...

1181
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:13,080
可是你要为更重要的事先将自己的感受抛在一边
...but put your feelings aside for something more important.

1182
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:15,720
我又要再听一次 你丈夫有多伟大
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is...

1183
01:20:15,890 --> 01:20:17,880
他为多么重要的目标战斗吗？
...what an important cause he's fighting for?

1184
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,390
那也是你的目标
It was your cause too.

1185
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:22,060
以你自己的方式 你也为相同的目标战斗
In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.

1186
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,190
我不再为任何事战斗了 除了为自己
I'm not fighting for anything anymore except myself.

1187
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,420
我唯一感兴趣的目标是自己
I'm the only cause I' m interested in.

1188
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,530
理查 我们曾经相爱过 如果那些日子对你有意义
We loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you...

1189
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:40,640
如果我是你 就不会提起巴黎 那是差劲的推销把戏
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

1190
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:44,270
求求你听我说 如果你知道事情的真相...
Listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth...

1191
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:46,510
不管你说什么 我也不会相信
I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said.

1192
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,710
为了达到目的 你现在什么也说得出口
You'd say anything now to get what you want.

1193
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,690
你很遗撼 是吗？
You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you?

1194
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,620
那么多事危在旦夕 你想到的只有自己的感觉
With so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings.

1195
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:04,360
一个女人伤害了你 你便对全世界报复
One woman has hurt you, and you take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1196
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,060
你是个胆小鬼 懦夫
You're a coward and a weakling.

1197
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:13,340
不 理查 对不起
No. Oh, Richard. I' m sorry.

1198
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:17,380
对不起 可是你是我们最后的希望
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1199
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:20,240
如果你不帮我们 维克多会死在卡萨布兰卡
If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1200
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,470
那又怎样？
What of it?

1201
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:24,310
我也会死在卡萨布兰卡 这是死亡的好地方
I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

1202
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,990
现在 如果你…
Now, if you'll...

1203
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,660
好吧
All right.

1204
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,860
我尝试跟你讲道理
I tried to reason with you.

1205
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,270
我什么法子也试了 现在我要那些信
I tried everything. Now, I want those letters.

1206
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:44,800
- 去拿给我  - 我不必去拿 就在这里
- Get them for me. - I don't have to. I got them right here.

1207
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,240
放在桌上
Put them on the table.

1208
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:51,140
不
No.

1209
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,340
最后一次 放在桌上
For the last time, put them on the table.

1210
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:59,650
如果拉斯罗和他的目标对你那么重要 什么也挡不住你
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything.

1211
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,050
好吧 我让你更方便一点
All right, I'll make it easier for you.

1212
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,190
开枪吧 你将会帮了我一个忙
Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor.

1213
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,000
理查
Richard...

1214
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:18,540
我尽量避开你
...I tried to stay away.

1215
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:21,570
我以为我永远不会再见到你
I thought I would never see you again.

1216
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:25,180
你已经在我生命中消失
That you were out of my life.

1217
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,460
你离开巴黎的那天
The day you left Paris...

1218
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,030
如果你知道我的感受
...if you knew what I went through.

1219
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,370
如果你知道我有多爱你
If you knew how much I loved you.

1220
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,210
我仍然有多么爱你
How much I still love you.

1221
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,120
然后呢？
And then?

1222
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:20,500
我们结婚后不久 维克多回到捷克
It wasrt long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1223
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:24,200
他们需要他在布拉格 可是秘密警察在等着他
They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1224
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,100
只看到报上的两行小启
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1225
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,900
维克多?拉斯罗被逮捕并送往集中营
"Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."

1226
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,410
我发狂一般 好几个月我努力打听消息
I was frantic. For months I tried to get word.

1227
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,910
消息终于来了
Then it came.

1228
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,280
他死了 逃走的时候 被枪打死
He was dead. Shot trying to escape.

1229
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:40,080
我好寂寞 我一无所有 连希望也没有
I was lonely. I had nothing, not even hope.

1230
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:42,920
后来我遇上了你
Then I met you.

1231
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:46,590
为什么你不对我诚实说？为什么你守着结婚的秘密？
Why werert you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1232
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,860
那不是我的秘密 理查 是维克多要那样
It wasrt my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way.

1233
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:52,590
甚至我们最要好的朋友 也不知道我们的婚事
Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage.

1234
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,010
那是他保护我的方法 关于他的工作我知道太多了
That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work.

1235
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:59,510
如果秘密警察发现我是他妻子 那会为我...
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me...

1236
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,200
...和地下工作者带来危险
...and for those working with us.

1237
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,180
你什么时候发现他仍然活着？
And when did you first find out he was alive?

1238
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,740
刚好我们准备一起离开巴黎前
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together.

1239
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,350
一个朋友前来告诉我维克多还活着
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive.

1240
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:13,650
他们把他藏在巴黎市郊的一节货运车厢上
They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris.

1241
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,980
他生病需要我
He was sick. He needed me.

1242
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,190
我想告诉你 可是我不敢
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.

1243
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,320
我知道你一定不会离开巴黎 秘密警察便会捉到你
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1244
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:27,100
所以我…
Well...

1245
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,100
...其余的你已知道了
...well, you know the rest.

1246
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,140
仍然是一个没有结局的故事
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1247
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:36,440
那现在呢？
What about now?

1248
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,670
现在？
Now?

1249
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,010
我不知道
I don't know.

1250
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:44,710
我知道我再没有勇气离开你
I know that I' II never have the strength to leave you again.

1251
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,980
那拉斯罗呢？
And Laszlo?

1252
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,590
你会帮助他的 理查 对不对？你设法使他离境
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out.

1253
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,090
他便能拥有他的工作 他生存的所有意义
Then he'll have his work. All that he's been living for.

1254
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,750
除了一样
All except one.

1255
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:58,670
他将没有你
He won't have you.

1256
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,570
我无法再挣扎下去
I can't fight it anymore.

1257
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,670
我曾舍你而去 我做不到第二次
I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.

1258
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:12,710
我再也不知道 什么是对什么是错
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

1259
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,940
你必须为我们两个着想
You have to think for both of us.

1260
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,350
为我们所有人着想
For all of us.

1261
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,620
好吧 我会的
All right. I will.

1262
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,460
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1263
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:34,360
我希望我没有那么爱你
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1264
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,810
- 我想我们甩掉他们了 - 没错
- I think we lost them. - Yes.

1265
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,150
- 我恐怕他们会抓到其他的人 - 进里面去
- I' m afraid they caught some of the others. - Come inside.

1266
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:01,330
来 拉斯罗先生 我会立刻帮你
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.

1267
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,330
谢谢
Thank you.

1268
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,950
卡尔 怎么回事？
Carl, what happened?

1269
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,750
警察破坏了我们的会议 我们刚好来得及逃走
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick. We escaped at the last moment.

1270
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,260
- 上来一下  - 好 我马上来
- Come up here a minute. - Yes, I come.

1271
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:32,730
我要你把后门关掉 可能会引起警察的注意
Turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.

1272
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,630
- 沙克每天都会关的  - 今晚他忘记了
- But Sascha always puts out that light. - Tonight he forgot.

1273
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:38,560
好 我来了 我会去关
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1274
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,740
- 我要你送林小姐回家  - 好的
- I want you to take Miss Lund home. - Yes, sir.

1275
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,850
没什么 只是小小的割伤 我们被迫从窗户爬出来
It's nothing, just a little cut. We had to get through a window.

1276
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:05,790
这可能有帮助
This might come in handy.

1277
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,090
谢谢
Thank you.

1278
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:09,920
- 千钧一发？- 对 挺危险
- Had a close one, eh? - Yes, rather.

1279
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,700
你有时候会不会想这值得吗？
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's won'th all this?

1280
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:16,810
我是指你战斗的目标
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1281
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,900
我不如问为什么我们要呼吸
We might as well question why we breathe.

1282
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,630
如果我们不呼吸 我们就会死
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1283
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:24,250
如果我们停止对抗敌人 世界就会死
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.

1284
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:26,680
那又怎样？苦难就结束了
What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.

1285
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,010
你知道你的口气像什么吗？
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1286
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:33,350
像一个拿内心不相信的事情来说服自己的人
Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1287
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,120
我们每一个人都有一个目标 善意的 或邪恶的
Each of us has a destiny. For good, or for evil.

1288
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,190
- 我明白了  - 我怀疑你是否真明白
- I get the point. - I wonder if you do.

1289
01:27:40,530 --> 01:27:43,620
我怀疑你知不知道你在逃避自己
I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself...

1290
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,390
你将永远不会成功
...and that you'll never succeed.

1291
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,800
你似乎对我的目标了如指掌
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1292
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:52,200
我知道关于你的事 比你怀疑的多
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect.

1293
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,770
例如我知道你爱上一个女人
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1294
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,740
或者这是一种奇怪的现象
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1295
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,810
我们两个会爱着同一个女人
...that we both should be in love with the same woman.

1296
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,140
我走进这咖啡馆的第一个晚上
The first evening I came into this cafe...

1297
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,690
我知道 你和伊莎之间有些不寻常
...I knew there was something between you and llsa.

1298
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:07,150
既然不能责怪任何人
Since no one is to blame...

1299
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,580
我不要求解释
...I demand no explanation.

1300
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,060
我只要求一件事 你不愿给我过境信函
I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit.

1301
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:14,790
没关系
All right.

1302
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,900
不过我要我的妻子安全
But I want my wife to be safe.

1303
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:18,600
我请求你帮忙
I ask you as a favor...

1304
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:21,700
用那些信带她离开卡萨布兰卡
...to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

1305
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:22,960
你那么爱她吗？
You love her that much?

1306
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,940
或者你只把我想成一个主义的领导者
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause.

1307
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:29,100
我也是个人
Well, I am also a human being.

1308
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:31,440
对 我是那么爱她
Yes, I love her that much.

1309
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,550
- 拉斯罗先生  - 什么事？
- Monsieur Laszlo?  - Yes?

1310
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,250
你跟我们走 我们有你的逮捕令
You'll come with us. We have a warrant for your arrest.

1311
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:44,420
什么罪名？
On what charge?

1312
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,790
雷诺队长稍后会跟你讨论
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later.

1313
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,690
似乎命运正在插手
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1314
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,640
你没有证据 这里是未被占领的法国 不是德国
You haven't any proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1315
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,600
你能做的只是罚他几千法O 或者拘禁30天
All you can do is fine him and give him 30 days.

1316
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:09,880
不如现在放了他
You might as well let him go now.

1317
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:13,080
瑞克 我奉劝你不要对拉斯罗发生的事太感兴趣
I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo.

1318
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,720
如果你企图帮他逃走...
If you were to help him escape...

1319
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:17,330
你为什么认为我会为拉斯罗冒险？
What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1320
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,960
第一 你赌十万法O他能逃掉
Because, one, you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1321
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:23,220
第二 你有那些过境信 不必否认了
Two, you've got the letters of transit. Don't bother to deny it.

1322
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,490
你可能会那样做 只为了你不喜欢史查沙的长相
And you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1323
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,540
事实上 我也不喜欢
As a matter of fact, I don't either.

1324
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,100
很好的理由
They're all excellent reasons.

1325
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:32,210
别太依赖我的友谊 瑞克
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1326
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:35,830
在这件事上 我无能为力 况且我可能输十万法O
In this matter I' m powerless. Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1327
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:40,740
你不算很奸滑 不过很有效 我明白你的意思
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I get the point.

1328
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,410
对 我有那些信
Yes, I have the letters.

1329
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:44,420
我打算自己用
But I intend using them myself.

1330
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:48,350
我要搭今晚最后的班机离开卡萨布兰卡
I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1331
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:51,590
我要带一位朋友一道走 一位你会赞赏的朋友
And I' m taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.

1332
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,730
- 什么朋友？ - 伊莎林
- What friend?  - Ilsa Lund.

1333
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,490
可以打消你认为我会帮拉斯罗逃走的想法吧
That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape.

1334
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,690
我最不愿意在美国看到的人
The last man I want to see in America.

1335
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:03,130
你来这里不是为了告诉我这些 你有过境信
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit.

1336
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:06,470
你可以填上你和她的名字 爱什么时候走都可以
You can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please.

1337
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,270
为什么你仍然对拉斯罗的境遇感兴趣？
Why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo?

1338
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,680
我没有 不过我对伊莎和我以后的境遇感兴趣
I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to llsa and me.

1339
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,890
我们有合法权利离开 是不是？
We have a legal right to go, that's true...

1340
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:19,580
不过即使有合法的权利 曾经也有人被留在卡萨布兰卡
...but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.

1341
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,120
- 为什么你认为我们会留置你？- 伊莎是拉斯罗的妻子
- What makes you think we want to hold you? - Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife.

1342
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,990
她大概知道一些史查沙想知道的事
She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know.

1343
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,690
路易 我跟你来一项协议
Louis, I' II make a deal with you.

1344
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:31,390
不用这项你加给他的小罪名 而找些真正的大罪名
Instead of this petty charge against him, you could get something big...

1345
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:34,830
可以叫他待在集中营好几年的
...something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years...

1346
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,600
- 可是大功一件 是不？- 不错
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it? - Certainly.

1347
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,940
德国和维琪政府会很感激
Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.

1348
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,170
那就放了他
Then release him.

1349
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,970
飞机起飞前半小时你到我的店
You be at my place a half -hour before the plane leaves.

1350
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,670
我安排拉斯罗来拿过境信
I'll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters...

1351
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,480
那便给你犯罪的证据以逮捕他
...and that'll give you grounds to make the arrest.

1352
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,050
你逮到他 而我们逃掉了
You get him, and we get away.

1353
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:55,120
对德国人来说 后者只会带来轻度的苦恼
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1354
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,120
这交易我还有些地方不太明白
There's still something about this I don't quite understand.

1355
01:30:58,330 --> 01:31:01,020
林小姐 她非常美丽...
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1356
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,530
...可是你从不对任何女人感兴趣
...but you were never interested in any woman.

1357
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,330
- 她不只是任何女人  - 我明白了
- She isn't just any woman. - I see.

1358
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:09,340
我怎么知道你会守信？
How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

1359
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:12,370
我马上在探访室 跟拉斯罗安排好
I'll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1360
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,730
瑞克 我将会怀念你
Rick, I'm gonna miss you.

1361
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:17,000
你是在卡萨布兰卡唯一比我更无顾忌的人
You're the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1362
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,540
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

1363
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,270
去吧 瑞克
Go ahead, Ricky.

1364
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,850
调走你的看门狗 我不要他们今天下午在附近
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go. I don't want them around this afternoon.

1365
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,350
我不能冒险 路易 即使跟你
I'm taking no chances, Louis, not even with you.

1366
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,520
我们要不要签一份文件 还是握手就够了？
Should we draw up papers, or is a handshake good enough?

1367
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,970
当然是不够 不过我很忙 只好这样了
Certainly not good enough. But since I' m in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1368
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:44,600
离开卡萨布兰卡去美国 你是幸运的人
To get out of Casablanca and go to America... You're a lucky man.

1369
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:48,870
我跟山姆的协定一直是他得到利润的百分之二十五
My agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits.

1370
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,210
这个协定仍然有效
That still goes.

1371
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,180
我凑巧知道是百分之十 不过他值百分之二十五
I happen to know he gets 10 percent. But he's won'th 25.

1372
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:56,320
阿都 卡尔和沙克要留在店里 不然我不卖
Abdul, Carl and Sascha, they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1373
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,950
当然 没有他们 就不是瑞克咖啡馆
Of course. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1374
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,450
再会
Well, so long.

1375
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:03,650
别忘了 你欠咖啡馆一百箱美国烟
Don't forget you owe Rick's 100 can'tons of American cigarettes.

1376
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:06,320
我会记得付给自己
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1377
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:18,540
"关闭 警察首长命令"

1378
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:44,030
- 你迟到了  - 我接到通知 拉斯罗刚离开饭店
- You're late.  - I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1379
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,500
我会来得及的
...so I knew I' d be on time.

1380
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:48,690
- 我说过把你的看门狗绑起来 - 不会有人跟踪他来这里
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs. - He won't be followed here.

1381
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:50,970
没有你 这地方会完全不一样
This place will never be the same without you.

1382
01:32:51,170 --> 01:32:53,270
我知道你的意思 我已经跟法拉利说好
I know what you mean. But I' ve spoken to Ferrari.

1383
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:54,700
你在轮盘上仍然可以赢
You'll still win at roulette.

1384
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,610
- 一切都准备好了吗？- 信就在这
- Is everything ready? - I have the letters right here.

1385
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,980
告诉我 我们搜查时藏在哪里？
When we searched the place, where were they?

1386
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,310
山姆的钢琴
Sam's piano.

1387
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:03,990
我活该 没有音乐细胞
Serves me right for not being musical.

1388
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:05,280
他们来了
Here they are.

1389
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:07,520
你最好到我办公室等
You better wait in my office.

1390
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,160
拿去
Here.

1391
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:19,830
维克多以为我跟他一起走 你没有告诉他吗？
Victor thinks I' m leaving with him. Havert you told him?

1392
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,440
- 还没有  - 可是没有关系 对不对？
- Not yet. - But you were able to arrange everything?

1393
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,970
你已经安排好了一切
Everything is quite all right.

1394
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,170
我们在机场告诉他 越少时间去想 对大家越好过
We'll tell him at the airport. The less time to think, the easier.

1395
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,170
请相信我
Please trust me.

1396
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,440
是 我会
Yes, I will.

1397
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:39,200
宾勒先生 我不知道如何感谢你
I don't know how to thank you.

1398
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:41,750
省省吧 我们还有很多事要做
Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1399
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:46,650
- 我把钱带来了 - 留着吧 在美国你会需要的
- I brought the money. - Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1400
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,960
- 可是我们协定过  - 别管它
- But we made a deal. - Never mind that.

1401
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:52,430
- 你在里斯本不会有麻烦吧？- 不会 一切都安排好了
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon? - No. It 's all arranged.

1402
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,930
很好 信就在这里 从没用过
Good. I' ve got the letters here, made out in blank.

1403
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,540
你只要补上签名就好了
All you have to do is fill in the signatures.

1404
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:59,110
维克多?拉斯罗
Victor Laszlo.

1405
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,370
维克多?拉斯罗 你被捕了
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1406
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:08,970
罪名是快递员谋杀案的帮凶 这些信是从他们身上偷的
The charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1407
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:12,820
你对我的朋友瑞克感到意外 理由很简单
You're surprised about my friend Ricky? The explanation is simple.

1408
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,990
爱情似乎战胜德行 谢谢...
Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1409
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,230
且慢 路易 不会有人被捕 起码不是现在
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1410
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,390
- 你是不是疯了?  - 我是 到那边坐下
- Have you lost your mind? - I have. Sit down.

1411
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:25,690
- 把枪放下  - 路易 我不想开枪打你
- Put that gun down. - I don't want to shoot you...

1412
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,730
但如果你再踏一步 我会的
...but I will if you take one more step.

1413
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,670
在这情况下 我会坐下
Under the circumstances, I will sit down.

1414
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:37,400
- 把手放在桌上 - 我怀疑你是否知道这代表什么
- Keep your hands on the table. - I wonder if you realize what this means.

1415
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,710
我知道 待会儿我们有很多时间讨论
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1416
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,470
调走你的看门狗 你说的
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1417
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:44,280
同样 你打电话到机场 让我听到你告诉他们
Just the same, call the airport and let me hear you tell them.

1418
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,850
记得这把枪正对着你的心脏
And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1419
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:49,120
那是我最不脆弱的地方
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1420
01:34:56,670 --> 01:34:58,730
喂？是机场吗？
Hello? Is that the airport?

1421
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,700
我是雷诺队长
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1422
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,460
有两份过境信要用来搭乘前往里斯本的班机
There'll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane.

1423
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,440
绝不能阻止他们
There's to be no trouble about them.

1424
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:07,870
好
Good.

1425
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:09,470
喂？
Hello?

1426
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:15,980
我的车 快点
My car, quickly!

1427
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:18,750
我是史查沙少校
This is Major Strasser.

1428
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,390
马上派一队警员到机场跟我会合
Have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once.

1429
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,850
马上 听到了吗？
At once, do you hear?

1430
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,020
喂？控制塔吗？
Hello, radio tower?

1431
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,300
前往里斯本的班机十分钟后起飞 东跑道
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes, east runway.

1432
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:38,040
能见度一里半
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1433
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:42,140
地面薄雾的深度大约五百
Light ground fog. Depth of fog approximately 500.

1434
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:45,040
上升高度不受限制 谢谢
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1435
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,290
路易 叫你的手下随拉斯罗先生去安置好行李
Have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage.

1436
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,230
当然 瑞克 一切依你
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1437
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:05,830
- 把拉斯罗的行李放在飞机上 - 是 长官
- Find Laszlo 's luggage. Put it on the plane. - Yes, sir.

1438
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:06,990
请走这边
This way, please.

1439
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:12,000
如果你不介意 你填上名字 那会更正式一点
If you don't mind, fill in the names. That'll make it more official.

1440
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,200
你什么都设想周到 对不对？
You think of everything, don't you?

1441
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,810
名字是维克多?拉斯罗先生和太太
And the names are Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1442
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:20,570
- 为什么是我的名字？- 因为你要上那架飞机
- But why my name, Richard?  - Because you're getting on that plane.

1443
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,340
我不明白 那你呢？
I don't understand. What about you?

1444
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,610
我留在这里看着他 等飞机安全离开为止
I'm staying with him till the plane gets away.

1445
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:26,780
不 理查 怎么回事？昨晚...
No. What has happened? Last night you said...

1446
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,750
昨晚我们说了很多
Last night we said a great many things.

1447
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,830
你说我要为我俩考虑
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1448
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,660
自那时候起我想了很多 想来想去只有一个结论
I've done a lot of it since then. It adds up to one thing:

1449
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,490
你跟维克多一起上那架飞机 你是属于他的
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.

1450
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,500
你非听我说不可
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1451
01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:41,570
知不知道如果你留在这里 会有什么后果？
Any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here?

1452
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:45,040
我们两个将会被关在集中营 对不对 路易？
Chances are we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1453
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:47,470
我恐怕史查沙少校会坚持
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1454
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:51,080
- 你这样说只是为了叫我走  - 我这样说是因为那是事实
- You're saying this only to make me go. - I' m saying it because it's true.

1455
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,510
我们的心里都明白你属于维克多
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.

1456
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,050
你是他工作的一部分 他的精神鼓励
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.

1457
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:59,090
如果飞机离地 你不在上面 你会后悔的
If that plane leaves and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1458
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:00,880
或者不是今天 或者不是明天
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

1459
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,780
不过很快 并且是后悔一辈子
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1460
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,750
那我们呢？
But what about us?

1461
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:07,330
我们永远拥有巴黎
We'll always have Paris.

1462
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,490
本来没有 你来卡萨布兰卡后 我们失去了
We didn't have... We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.

1463
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,560
不过昨晚我们重拾回来
We got it back last night.

1464
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:17,240
- 昨晚我说我永远不离开你  - 你永远不会
- When I said I would never leave you. - And you never will.

1465
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,230
我也有工作要做
But I' ve got a job to do too.

1466
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,170
我要去的地方你不能跟来 我要做的事你无法参与
Where I' m going, you can't follow. What I' ve got to do you can't be any part of.

1467
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:25,300
伊莎 我并不是高尚
Ilsa, I' m no good at being noble.

1468
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:28,940
不过要明白也不难 在这疯狂的世界...
But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people...

1469
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:31,810
三个小人物就别太计较了
...don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

1470
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:34,510
总有一天你会明白的
Someday you'll understand that.

1471
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,450
而现在…
Now, now.

1472
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,390
永志不忘
Here's looking at you, kid.

1473
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,040
- 一切都就绪了  - 除了一件事
- Everything is in order. - All except one thing.

1474
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,410
在你离开前 有些事你应该知道
There's something you should know.

1475
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,450
宾勒先生 你不要求你解释什么
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1476
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:06,710
我打算要 因为往后可能会影响到你
I'm going to anyway. It may make a difference to you later on.

1477
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:08,750
你说你知道伊莎和我的事
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1478
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:11,790
你不知道 昨晚你进来时 她正在我的店里
You didn't know she was at my place last night when you were.

1479
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,400
她来是为了过境信 对吗 伊莎？
She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, llsa?

1480
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:17,060
对
Yes.

1481
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:19,260
可是都没有效
She tried everything to get them. Nothing worked.

1482
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,960
她尽全力让我相信她仍爱着我
She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me.

1483
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,660
那在很久以前就结束了
But that was all over long ago.

1484
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,110
为了你的缘故 她假装不是 我让她继续假装下去
For your sake, she pretended it wasrt, and I let her pretend.

1485
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,240
我明白
I understand.

1486
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,610
- 拿去 - 谢谢
- Here it is. - Thanks.

1487
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,110
我很感激
I appreciate it.

1488
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:38,750
欢迎你回到战线上
Welcome back to the fight.

1489
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,480
这一次我知道我们这边会赢
This time I know our side will win.

1490
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,370
你准备好了吗 伊莎？
Are you ready, llsa?

1491
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,610
我准备好了
Yes, I' m ready.

1492
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,110
再见 瑞克
Goodbye, Rick.

1493
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,880
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

1494
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:11,910
最好快点 不然你会赶不上飞机
You better hurry. You'll miss that plane.

1495
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,910
我是对的 你是个感情用事的人
I was right. You are a sentimentalist.

1496
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:34,910
留在原地 我不知你在说什么
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.

1497
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,410
你刚才为拉斯罗做的事
What you just did for Laszlo.

1498
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,980
你为了叫伊莎跟他走而编的童话故事
That fairy tale you invented to send llsa away with him.

1499
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:41,480
我对女人略知一二 朋友 她走了
I know a little about women, my friend. She went.

1500
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:43,710
不过她知道你在说谎
But she knew you were lying.

1501
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:45,820
不管如何 感谢你帮我忙
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1502
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:50,290
我假定你知道我们都将不好过 特别是你
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1503
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,950
- 当然我必须逮捕你  - 飞机一走 马上可以
- I' II have to arrest you, of course. - As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1504
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,340
- 那通电话是什么意思？- 维克多在那架飞机上
- What was the meaning of that phone call? - Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1505
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,000
你为何站在这？你为何不阻止他？
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?

1506
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:12,200
问瑞克先生
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1507
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,350
- 别碰那电话  - 我劝你不要干涉
- Get away from that phone. - I advise you not to interfere.

1508
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:20,820
我愿意开枪打雷诺队长 也会愿意打你
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I' m willing to shoot you.

1509
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:24,350
- 喂  - 把电话放下
- Hello! - Put that phone down.

1510
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:26,390
- 替我接控制塔  - 放下
- Get me the radio tower. - Put it down!

1511
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,000
史查沙少校被射杀
Major Strasser has been shot.

1512
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,410
围捕可疑的嫌犯
Round up the usual suspects.

1513
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:00,330
搬上车

1514
01:41:09,310 --> 01:41:10,500
(维琪矿泉水)

1515
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:17,810
瑞克 你不只是感情用事 你已变成爱国份子了
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.

1516
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,140
似乎现在是开始的好时机
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.

1517
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,550
我想你是对的
I think perhaps you're right.

1518
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:51,040
你在卡萨布兰卡消失一段时间 可能是个好主意
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1519
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:53,650
在巴撒市那边有自由法国驻军
There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville.

1520
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:57,620
- 我可以帮你安排通行  - 我的过境信？
- I could be induced to arrange a passage. - My letter of transit?

1521
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:59,080
我大可以去旅行
I could use a trip.

1522
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:02,550
那不影响我们的赌注 你仍然欠我十万法O
But it doesn't change our bet. You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1523
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:05,690
那十万法O应该够我们的开销
That 10,000 francs should pay our expenses.

1524
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:07,090
我们的开销？
"Our" expenses?

1525
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:12,130
路易 我想这是美好友谊的开始
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
