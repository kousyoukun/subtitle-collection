00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:14,216
With the coming
of the Second World War...

5
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:18,547
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

6
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:21,554
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

7
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:24,423
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

8
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,794
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

9
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:31,898
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

10
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,566
Paris to Marseilles...

11
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,242
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,050
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

13
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,730
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

14
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:02,525
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

15
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,202
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

16
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,803
And from Lisbon to the New World.

17
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,206
But the others wait in Casablanca.

18
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,337
And wait and wait...

19
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,347
...and wait.

20
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,586
To all officers:

21
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:34,632
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

22
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,827
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

23
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:41,838
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

24
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,606
Important.

25
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,774
May we see your papers?

26
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,771
I don't think I have them on me.

27
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,278
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It 's possible that I...

28
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,542
Yes. Here they are.

29
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,622
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

30
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,451
Halt!

31
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:34,717
Halt!

32
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,350
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

33
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:05,023
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

34
00:04:05,191 --> 00:04:07,989
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

35
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:11,823
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

36
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,500
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

37
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:18,330
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

38
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,968
Along with these unappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

39
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,546
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

40
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:33,014
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

41
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,210
This place is full of vultures.

42
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:38,118
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

43
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,759
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

44
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,794
What an amusing little fellow.

45
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:46,295
Waiter.

46
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,699
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

47
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:52,235
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

48
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,056
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

49
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,475
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

50
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:40,846
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:45,317
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

52
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,517
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

53
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,692
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

54
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:52,524
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

55
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,167
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

56
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,529
That is kind of you.

57
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,842
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

58
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,675
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

59
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,951
- Perhaps you werert referring to weather.
- What else?

60
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,383
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

61
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:19,355
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

62
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:22,552
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

63
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,697
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

64
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,323
I've already heard about this cafe.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

65
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,117
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

66
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,295
I'll never get out of here.

67
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,562
I'll die in Casablanca.

68
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,995
But can't you make it just a little more?

69
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,134
Please?

70
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:38,769
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

71
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,202
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

72
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,533
All right.

73
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,677
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything...

74
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,607
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

75
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:56,188
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

76
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,654
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

77
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,123
Remember, in cash.

78
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:09,994
Cheerio.

79
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,702
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

80
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:24,445
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

81
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,313
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

82
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,987
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

83
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,020
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

84
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:38,061
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

85
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,892
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

86
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:44,628
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

87
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,306
We have something
to look forward to.

88
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,836
And his father is the bellboy.

89
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,040
Excuse me.

90
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,672
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

91
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,438
Of all the nerve. Who do you think...?
I know there is gambling in there.

92
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,778
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

93
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,979
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

94
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,217
And if you think I' m going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

95
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,361
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

96
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,829
Your cash is good at the bar.

97
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,998
What? Do you know who I am?

98
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,171
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

99
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,341
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

100
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:02,671
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

101
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,682
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

102
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:09,821
- But when you first came, I thought...
- You thought what?

103
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,520
What right do I have to think?

104
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,825
May I

105
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,526
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasrt it?

106
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,364
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

107
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,802
...today they are the honored dead.

108
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:31,844
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

109
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:33,170
I forgive you.

110
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,040
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

111
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,217
I forgot, you never drink with...
I'll have another, please.

112
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,881
You despise me, don't you?

113
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,245
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

114
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,753
But why?

115
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,855
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

116
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:53,021
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

117
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:57,794
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

118
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,234
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

119
00:11:01,774 --> 00:11:04,800
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault 's price.

120
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:08,412
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

121
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:12,176
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

122
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,752
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

123
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,618
And I' m leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

124
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,851
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

125
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:25,528
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

126
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,056
Look, Rick.

127
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,401
Know what this is?

128
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,702
Something that even you have never seen.

129
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:36,033
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

130
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,540
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

131
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:40,679
One moment.

132
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:44,178
Tonight I' II be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

133
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,183
And then, addio, Casablanca.

134
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:51,683
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

135
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,325
...you are the only one I trust.

136
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,389
Will you keep these for me, please?

137
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:58,359
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

138
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,295
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

139
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,059
Please keep them for me.

140
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,430
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

141
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,940
Waiter. I' II be expecting some people.

142
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:11,008
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

143
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,212
Rick...

144
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:15,539
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

145
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:20,148
If you'll forgive me, I' II share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

146
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,411
Just a moment.

147
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:27,620
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

148
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:33,895
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

149
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,036
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

150
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:00,918
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

151
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:02,714
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

152
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:05,380
- Fine, but I' d like to buy your cafe.
- It 's not for sale.

153
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,822
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It 's not for sale at any price.

154
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,556
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

155
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,892
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

156
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:19,162
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

157
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,738
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

158
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,010
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

159
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:26,270
Suppose we do.

160
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:31,382
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

161
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:34,346
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

162
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,612
Oh, I like it fine here.

163
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:39,689
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

164
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,153
Sorry.

165
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,328
The boss's private stock...

166
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,934
...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

167
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:54,095
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

168
00:14:58,811 --> 00:15:01,473
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

169
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,981
Where were you last night?

170
00:15:08,154 --> 00:15:10,418
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

171
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:14,089
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

172
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:16,622
Give me another.

173
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:19,560
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

174
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,927
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

175
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,602
- Rick, I' m tired of having you...
- Sascha, call a cab.

176
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,204
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

177
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,933
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

178
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:34,379
Hey, taxi.

179
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,241
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

180
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,179
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

181
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,377
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

182
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:42,521
And come right back.

183
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,222
Yes, boss.

184
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,662
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

185
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,134
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

186
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,034
Someday they may be scarce.

187
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,475
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

188
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,269
Maybe get her on the rebound.

189
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,572
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

190
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,827
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

191
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,859
The plane to Lisbon.

192
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,335
You would like to be on it?

193
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,201
Why? What's in Lisbon?

194
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,442
The clipper to America.

195
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,340
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

196
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:45,483
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

197
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,547
Llike to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

198
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:50,415
It's a combination of all three.

199
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,057
And what in heavers name
brought you to Casablanca?

200
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,693
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

201
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,158
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

202
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,563
I was misinformed.

203
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,501
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

204
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:08,504
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

205
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:11,069
...and the cashier
would like some money.

206
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,673
I'll get it from the safe.

207
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,404
I'm so upset, Rick. You know l- -

208
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,208
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

209
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,180
I'm awfully sorry.

210
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:29,421
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your cafe.

211
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,324
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

212
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,895
A murderer, no less.

213
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:37,127
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

214
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:41,136
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

215
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:47,402
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

216
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,707
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

217
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,349
It will amuse your customers.

218
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,043
Our entertainment's enough.

219
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:56,680
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

220
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:59,357
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

221
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,719
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

222
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,454
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

223
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,564
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

224
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:10,668
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

225
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,962
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

226
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:14,264
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

227
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,306
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

228
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,977
How observant you are.

229
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:22,041
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

230
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,181
Yeah?

231
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:25,780
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

232
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,912
There are many exit visas sold in this cafe,
but we know that you've never sold one.

233
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,585
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

234
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,057
I thought it was because
llet you win at roulette.

235
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,456
That is another reason.

236
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,427
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

237
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,500
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

238
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,170
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

239
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:47,971
Victor Laszlo?

240
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,734
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

241
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,878
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

242
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,514
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

243
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,684
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

244
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,953
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

245
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:04,281
- Manages what?
- His escape.

246
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,355
- But I just told you...
- Stop it.

247
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,188
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

248
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,693
This is the end of the chase.

249
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:14,491
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

250
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,030
Is that a serious offer?

251
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,563
I just paid out 20,
and I' d like to get it back.

252
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:21,566
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

253
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:23,568
- Okay.
- Done.

254
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:27,735
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

255
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,238
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

256
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,179
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I' ve seen the lady.

257
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,114
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

258
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,748
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

259
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,085
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

260
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,524
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

261
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,759
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

262
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:52,297
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

263
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,200
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

264
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,775
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

265
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,103
Let me point out just two items:

266
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:04,405
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

267
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:08,519
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

268
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,019
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

269
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,521
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

270
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:14,926
Maybe.

271
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,190
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

272
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,160
I have my orders.

273
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,798
I see. Gestapo spank.

274
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,800
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

275
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,338
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

276
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,635
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

277
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,937
- I am...
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

278
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:36,343
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

279
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,355
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

280
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:54,158
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

281
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:59,499
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

282
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:06,400
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

283
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,483
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

284
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,678
- Wort you join us?
- Thank you.

285
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,487
- It 's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

286
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:25,061
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

287
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,198
Very well, sir.

288
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:30,730
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

289
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:34,531
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

290
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,197
I expected no less, captain.

291
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,033
Monsieur Ugarte.

292
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,446
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

293
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:46,682
May I first please cash my chips?

294
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,454
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

295
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,284
Rick! Rick, help me!

296
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,580
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

297
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:33,561
Excellent, captain.

298
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,394
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

299
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,661
I stick my neck out for nobody.

300
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:42,703
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

301
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:46,435
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

302
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:57,689
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

303
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,790
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

304
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,085
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

305
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:04,762
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

306
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,925
We are very honored tonight.

307
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:14,266
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

308
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,409
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

309
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,203
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

310
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,371
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

311
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:26,175
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

312
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,945
- What is your nationality?
- I' m a drunkard.

313
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,547
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

314
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,382
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

315
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:39,124
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

316
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,061
There seems to be no secret about that.

317
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:45,430
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

318
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,834
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

319
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,905
Can you imagine us in London?

320
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,510
When you get there, ask me.

321
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:54,171
Diplomatist.

322
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,506
How about New York?

323
00:23:55,681 --> 00:24:00,550
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

324
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:03,953
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

325
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:08,787
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

326
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:13,260
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

327
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,266
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

328
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:23,007
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

329
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,939
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

330
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:28,340
Are my eyes really brown?

331
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:31,744
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

332
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,147
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

333
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,288
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

334
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:41,516
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

335
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:45,488
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

336
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:49,133
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

337
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:52,335
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

338
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,096
...until the day we marched in.

339
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:58,607
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

340
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:01,473
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

341
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,849
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

342
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,986
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

343
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:12,590
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

344
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:14,656
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

345
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:17,795
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

346
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,562
Perhaps.

347
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:28,671
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

348
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,563
Two Cointreaux, please.

349
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,071
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

350
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:05,333
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

351
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:08,479
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

352
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:11,844
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the cafe.

353
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:16,348
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

354
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:21,055
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

355
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,728
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

356
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,429
The ring is quite unique.

357
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:31,229
- Yes, I' m very interested.
- Good.

358
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:32,792
What is your name?

359
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,302
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

360
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,070
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

361
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:41,838
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

362
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:45,074
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I' m sorry, it is.

363
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,013
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

364
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,190
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

365
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:53,551
Yes, what is it you want?

366
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,853
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

367
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:59,758
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

368
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,399
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

369
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,059
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

370
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,170
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

371
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,843
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

372
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:14,808
That was a gross understatement.

373
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,269
You're very kind.

374
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,983
- Wort you join us?
- Lf you will permit me.

375
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:23,946
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

376
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:28,491
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

377
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:32,426
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

378
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,565
Somewhere I' ve seen him.

379
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,256
- Sam?
- Yes.

380
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,197
He came from Paris with Rick.

381
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,837
Rick? Who is he?

382
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,406
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

383
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:46,873
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

384
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,775
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

385
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:53,474
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

386
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:55,977
Excuse me.

387
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,985
Major.

388
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:02,652
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

389
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:03,817
How do you do?

390
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:05,997
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

391
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,722
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I' m not gracious.

392
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:11,061
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

393
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:15,329
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

394
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,977
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I' m now on French soil.

395
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:23,978
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

396
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,776
This is hardly the time or place.

397
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:30,387
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

398
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:31,817
With mademoiselle.

399
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,518
Captain, I am under your authority.

400
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:38,720
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

401
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,832
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

402
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:44,332
Very well.

403
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:51,533
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

404
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,844
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I' m afraid for you.

405
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,910
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

406
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:34,151
I must find out what Berger knows.

407
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:37,549
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

408
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,069
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

409
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,235
Champagne cocktail, please.

410
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,809
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

411
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:06,951
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

412
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,088
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

413
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:13,155
As you see,
it was true every single time.

414
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:14,848
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

415
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,552
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

416
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:21,528
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

417
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:25,931
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

418
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:27,664
I see.

419
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:32,166
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

420
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,605
Underground, like everywhere else.

421
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:37,611
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

422
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:39,610
If you will come...

423
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,463
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

424
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:57,761
Very well, mademoiselle.

425
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:03,238
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

426
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:07,572
Too bad you werert here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

427
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,313
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

428
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:12,917
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

429
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,887
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss llsa.

430
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,559
I never expected to see you again.

431
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,891
It's been a long time.

432
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:28,065
Yes, ma'am.
Alot of water under the bridge.

433
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:32,936
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

434
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:44,015
Where is Rick?

435
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:47,117
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

436
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:51,520
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...

437
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,419
He went home.

438
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,793
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never...

439
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:00,363
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

440
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:02,658
Goes up there all the time.

441
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,898
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

442
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,070
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.

443
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,981
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

444
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:19,548
I don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.

445
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:21,641
Play it, Sam.

446
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:24,645
Play "As Time Goes By."

447
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,218
I can't remember it, Miss llsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

448
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:31,095
I'll hum it for you.

449
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,173
Sing it, Sam.

450
00:33:30,322 --> 00:33:33,086
Sam, I thought I told you never to play...

451
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:46,704
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present...

452
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,203
- Hello, llsa.
- Hello, Rick.

453
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:52,865
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also...

454
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,442
This is Mr. Laszlo.

455
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:56,011
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

456
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,473
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

457
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,647
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

458
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:02,979
- Wort you join us for a drink?
- Rick never...

459
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:05,019
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

460
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,125
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

461
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:12,385
- Interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

462
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,087
- What for?
- Your work.

463
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,994
Thank you. I try.

464
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:18,801
We all try. You succeed.

465
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:23,872
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

466
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,233
I wasrt sure you were the same.

467
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,878
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was La Belle Aurore.

468
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,383
How nice. You remembered.

469
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,349
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

470
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:38,715
Not an easy day to forget.

471
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:43,222
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

472
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,223
Yes. I put that dress away.

473
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:49,764
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

474
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:54,064
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

475
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:57,703
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

476
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:01,970
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

477
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,148
...to be found drinking after hours.

478
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,281
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

479
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,177
- Your check, sir.
- It 's my party.

480
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:12,948
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

481
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:17,094
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

482
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,991
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

483
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,222
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

484
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:26,226
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

485
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:29,273
He hasn't played it in a long time.

486
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,743
- Good night.
- Good night.

487
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,538
Night.

488
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,888
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

489
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:48,320
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

490
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:51,086
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

491
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:52,957
- Good night.
- Good night.

492
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,293
Boss?

493
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:38,909
- Boss?
- Yeah?

494
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,470
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

495
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,615
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

496
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,909
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

497
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:50,584
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

498
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:51,948
Good, then have a drink.

499
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:54,090
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

500
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,783
Boss, let's get out of here.

501
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,518
No, sir. I' m waiting for a lady.

502
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,290
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

503
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,501
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

504
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,363
We'll take the car and drive all night.

505
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,403
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

506
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:12,942
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I' m staying right here.

507
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:20,940
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

508
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:24,881
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

509
00:37:26,024 --> 00:37:28,117
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

510
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:32,756
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

511
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:34,356
What?

512
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:36,233
My watch stopped.

513
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,263
I bet they're asleep in New York.

514
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,200
I bet they're asleep all over America.

515
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,178
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

516
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,342
...she walks into mine.

517
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:05,558
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

518
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,528
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

519
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,827
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

520
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:14,198
- I don't think I can remember...
- lf she can stand it, I can.

521
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:15,394
Play it.

522
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,906
Yes, boss.

523
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,395
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

524
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,693
What did you do,
and what did you think?

525
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:55,238
We said no questions.

526
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,902
Here's looking at you, kid.

527
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:37,642
A franc for your thoughts.

528
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,249
In America they'd bring only a penny.

529
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,652
I guess that's about all they're won'th.

530
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:47,485
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

531
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:49,919
Well, I was wondering...

532
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:56,132
Why I' m so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

533
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:59,430
Why there is no other man in my life?

534
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,003
That's easy.
There was.

535
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,500
He's dead.

536
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,346
I'm sorry for asking.

537
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:13,415
I forgot we said no questions.

538
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:20,921
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

539
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:09,629
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

540
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,776
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

541
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:16,380
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

542
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,553
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

543
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:08,529
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

544
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,998
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

545
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:13,431
You said it.

546
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:15,572
Here's looking at you, kid.

547
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,824
My Germars a little rusty.

548
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:47,695
It's the Gestapo.

549
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:52,472
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

550
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:57,114
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

551
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:03,387
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

552
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:05,248
It's pretty bad timing.

553
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:09,185
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

554
00:44:10,828 --> 00:44:12,261
Let's see.

555
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:16,398
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

556
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:18,524
Looking for a job.

557
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:26,733
Was that cannon fire?

558
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,177
Or is it my heart pounding?

559
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,407
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

560
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,914
And getting closer every minute.

561
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,216
Here, here, drink up.

562
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,787
We'll never finish the other three.

563
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:46,430
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

564
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:48,724
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

565
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:51,891
Ileft a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

566
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,734
It's strange.

567
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:58,340
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

568
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:00,875
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

569
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,046
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

570
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:06,375
No, we must leave.

571
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,785
Yes, of course. We.

572
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:12,717
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

573
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,922
Not at my hotel. I...

574
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:19,690
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

575
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:21,924
I'll meet you at the station.

576
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,326
All right, at a quarter to 5.

577
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,399
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

578
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,770
That's too far ahead to plan.

579
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:34,740
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

580
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:39,574
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

581
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:43,781
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that...

582
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,216
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

583
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,459
Llove you so much.

584
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:00,603
And I hate this war so much.

585
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:05,303
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

586
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:08,912
If you shouldn't get away...

587
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:13,014
If something should keep us apart...

588
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,818
...wherever they put you...

589
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:19,251
...and wherever I' II be,
I want you to know that I...

590
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,091
Kiss me.

591
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,431
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

592
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:06,903
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

593
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,562
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

594
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,866
But this note came just after you left.

595
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:28,719
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

596
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:30,960
Do you hear me?

597
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:34,630
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

598
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:28,080
Rick, I have to talk to you.

599
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:32,785
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

600
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,084
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

601
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:41,053
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

602
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,664
I wouldn't have come
if I' d known you were here.

603
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,369
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

604
00:48:46,537 --> 00:48:49,938
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

605
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:52,200
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

606
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:56,043
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

607
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:58,744
I can understand how you feel.

608
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,744
You understand how I feel.

609
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,215
How long was it we had, honey?

610
00:49:05,189 --> 00:49:07,350
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

611
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,090
Every one of them.

612
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,660
Mostly I remember the last one.

613
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:16,427
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

614
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,329
...with a comical look on his face...

615
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:20,470
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

616
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:24,666
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

617
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:27,333
Does it got a wild finish?

618
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:29,671
I don't know the finish yet.

619
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:33,283
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

620
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:39,519
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

621
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,419
At the house of some friends...

622
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,459
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

623
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:47,825
A very great and courageous man.

624
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:50,496
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

625
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:53,262
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

626
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:57,539
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

627
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:59,471
And she looked up to him...

628
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:01,210
...and worshiped him...

629
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:04,210
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

630
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:06,508
Yes, that's very pretty.

631
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:10,381
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

632
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,352
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

633
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:15,856
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

634
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:21,321
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

635
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:27,433
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

636
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:28,662
Tell me...

637
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,699
...who was it you left me for?

638
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,742
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

639
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,811
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

640
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,667
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

641
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:09,243
I would suggest you search
the cafe immediately.

642
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:12,439
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

643
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:14,707
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

644
00:51:14,918 --> 00:51:17,512
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

645
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,713
We mustrt underestimate
American blundering.

646
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:23,859
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

647
00:51:24,027 --> 00:51:26,928
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

648
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:30,931
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

649
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,634
There is nothing we can do.

650
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:42,339
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

651
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:43,480
I slept very well.

652
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,240
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

653
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:51,419
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Wort you sit down?

654
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:56,991
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

655
00:51:57,161 --> 00:51:59,493
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

656
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:01,453
You have reached Casablanca.

657
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:04,428
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

658
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,727
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

659
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:09,701
Not at all. Renault 's signature
is necessary on every visa.

660
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:12,569
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

661
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,075
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

662
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,303
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

663
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:19,643
And mademoiselle?

664
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:23,309
- You needrt be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

665
00:52:23,554 --> 00:52:26,455
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

666
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:29,285
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

667
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,394
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

668
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,757
- On one condition.
- And that is?

669
00:52:34,031 --> 00:52:37,228
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

670
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:38,765
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

671
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,233
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

672
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:43,963
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

673
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:46,802
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

674
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:48,740
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

675
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:51,674
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

676
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:54,577
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

677
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:58,521
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

678
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:02,548
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

679
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:05,694
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

680
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:08,456
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

681
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:11,332
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

682
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:13,025
What if you murdered all of us?

683
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,604
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

684
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,106
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

685
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:23,769
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

686
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:25,539
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

687
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:28,274
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

688
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:29,975
But there is one exception.

689
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,814
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

690
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,891
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

691
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,591
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

692
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,286
This is still unoccupied France.

693
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:43,630
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

694
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,496
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

695
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,766
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

696
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:55,276
I believe you have a message for him?

697
00:53:55,445 --> 00:53:57,709
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

698
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,240
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

699
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:03,316
Signor Ugarte is dead.

700
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:11,417
I'm making out the report now.

701
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,189
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

702
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:16,730
...or died trying to escape.

703
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,064
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

704
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,761
Good day.

705
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:29,805
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

706
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,004
Excuse me, captain.

707
00:54:31,214 --> 00:54:34,206
Another visa problem has come up.

708
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:37,586
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

709
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:49,289
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

710
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:52,230
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

711
00:54:52,402 --> 00:54:54,597
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

712
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:57,399
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

713
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,667
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

714
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:02,004
Thanks.

715
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:15,256
Don't be too downearted.

716
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:17,518
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

717
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:19,025
Thank you very much, signor.

718
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:21,630
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

719
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:23,959
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

720
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,192
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

721
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,602
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

722
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:32,742
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

723
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:34,206
Here, sit down.

724
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:37,039
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

725
00:55:37,214 --> 00:55:38,841
Bourbon.

726
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:41,050
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

727
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:44,415
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

728
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,619
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

729
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,816
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

730
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:51,290
Practically no one.

731
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:53,759
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

732
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:56,090
So could I,
and I' m a poor businessman.

733
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:00,133
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I' II handle the entire transaction.

734
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:03,170
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

735
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:04,863
And the carrying charges?

736
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:07,806
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

737
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:10,912
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

738
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,639
I'll tell him when he comes in.

739
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:15,444
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

740
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:18,916
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

741
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:27,654
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

742
00:56:27,831 --> 00:56:31,164
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

743
00:56:31,334 --> 00:56:33,268
Excuse me, I' II be getting back.

744
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:40,604
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

745
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:47,910
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

746
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:49,415
Only 700 francs.

747
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,782
- You're being cheated.
- Doesrt matter, thank you.

748
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:56,084
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

749
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:58,818
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

750
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:02,658
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

751
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:03,822
Doesrt matter.

752
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,936
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

753
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:11,131
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

754
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:12,933
I have some tablecloths, napkins...

755
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,806
- Thank you. I' m really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

756
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:19,608
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

757
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:20,807
Yes.

758
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:23,350
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

759
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:25,111
I don't think I will, Rick.

760
00:57:25,288 --> 00:57:29,588
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I' m entitled to know.

761
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,955
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

762
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:35,860
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

763
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:38,592
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

764
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:43,163
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

765
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:48,368
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

766
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:53,346
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

767
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:54,943
Not last night.

768
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:58,850
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

769
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:01,923
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

770
00:58:02,092 --> 00:58:03,787
You can believe that if you want to.

771
00:58:03,994 --> 00:58:06,724
Well, I' m not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

772
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:08,694
Above a saloon, it's true...

773
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:10,332
...but walk up a flight...

774
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,229
...I' II be expecting you.

775
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:17,102
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

776
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:19,003
You'll be there.

777
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:21,568
No, Rick.

778
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:25,243
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

779
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:29,844
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

780
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:38,986
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I' m not able to help him.

781
00:58:39,162 --> 00:58:41,062
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

782
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:45,826
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

783
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:49,438
But it would not be won'th my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

784
00:58:49,606 --> 00:58:51,437
You, however, are a different matter.

785
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:56,244
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

786
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,808
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

787
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:03,281
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while...

788
00:59:03,453 --> 00:59:05,250
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

789
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:08,880
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

790
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,486
We are only interested in two visas.

791
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,925
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

792
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,357
You two will want to discuss this.

793
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,501
Excuse me. I' II be at the bar.

794
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:24,169
No, llsa.
I won't let you stay here.

795
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,708
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

796
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:29,741
But if the situation were different...

797
00:59:29,913 --> 00:59:32,473
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

798
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:33,946
...would you take it?

799
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:36,243
Yes, I would.

800
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:38,648
Yes, I see.

801
00:59:39,823 --> 00:59:43,725
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

802
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:47,955
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

803
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:49,928
...why didn't you leave me then?

804
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:53,725
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

805
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:57,673
Ilove you very much, llsa.

806
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,968
Your secret will be safe with me.

807
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:04,138
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

808
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:06,646
Not more than 50 francs.

809
01:00:11,388 --> 01:00:13,185
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

810
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:16,723
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

811
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:18,861
Well, good luck, but be careful.

812
01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:21,862
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

813
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:25,224
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

814
01:00:25,435 --> 01:00:28,131
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

815
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:30,205
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

816
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:33,570
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

817
01:00:33,743 --> 01:00:34,732
Yes, something.

818
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:38,108
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

819
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,272
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

820
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:43,509
But I' d guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

821
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:48,619
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

822
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:50,452
But it is won'th a chance.

823
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,825
Thank you very much.
Good day.

824
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:57,761
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

825
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:00,801
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

826
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:03,405
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

827
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:14,443
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

828
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:16,782
- I' d better be going.
- My check, please.

829
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:20,718
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

830
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:23,757
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

831
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:25,554
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

832
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:27,390
I'm sorry.

833
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:46,943
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

834
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:51,351
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

835
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:53,421
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

836
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:55,955
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

837
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,117
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

838
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:00,558
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

839
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:02,857
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

840
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:04,967
You know how
that impresses Germans.

841
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:08,600
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

842
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:11,065
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

843
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:16,168
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

844
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:18,943
It looks like you're a little late.

845
01:02:26,256 --> 01:02:27,917
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

846
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:31,857
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

847
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:35,754
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I' II see you later.

848
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:38,032
Sascha!

849
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:39,225
French 75s.

850
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,099
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

851
01:02:43,273 --> 01:02:44,604
We will begin with two.

852
01:02:53,683 --> 01:02:55,878
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

853
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:59,453
- What I said is none of your business.
- I' II make it my business.

854
01:03:05,628 --> 01:03:09,291
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

855
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,228
You see, captain?

856
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,872
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

857
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:19,939
We try to cooperate
with your government.

858
01:03:20,143 --> 01:03:22,407
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

859
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:24,740
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

860
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:27,209
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

861
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,714
I blow with the wind...

862
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:31,285
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

863
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:33,183
And if it should change?

864
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:35,617
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

865
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:37,885
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

866
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:41,495
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

867
01:03:41,998 --> 01:03:44,694
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

868
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:46,426
Aleader? Like Laszlo?

869
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,401
I have been thinking.

870
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:52,037
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

871
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,197
I see what you mean.

872
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:00,980
Thank you, Carl.

873
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,414
Thank you, Carl.

874
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,554
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

875
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:08,323
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

876
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:09,583
Thank you very much.

877
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:12,522
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

878
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:14,560
...and a third glass.

879
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,722
At last the day's came!

880
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,733
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

881
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:22,770
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

882
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:24,600
A very nice idea.

883
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:26,169
To America.

884
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:27,932
To America.

885
01:04:35,518 --> 01:04:36,917
What watch?

886
01:04:37,787 --> 01:04:40,779
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

887
01:04:42,425 --> 01:04:44,757
You will get along beautifully in America.

888
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:47,525
How is lady luck treating you?

889
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:49,561
Oh, too bad.

890
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:51,764
You'll find him over there.

891
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,531
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

892
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:02,940
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

893
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:05,444
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

894
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:06,946
My husband is with me too.

895
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,880
He is? Captain Renault 's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

896
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:11,042
Have a drink?

897
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:13,917
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

898
01:05:14,524 --> 01:05:15,582
Monsieur Rick...

899
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:19,887
...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

900
01:05:20,063 --> 01:05:21,052
No, I mean...

901
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:23,058
...is he trustwon'thy?
Is his word...?

902
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:27,369
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

903
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:29,596
I thought so. Where's your husband?

904
01:05:29,872 --> 01:05:34,138
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

905
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,107
Oh, of course he's losing.

906
01:05:36,346 --> 01:05:39,247
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

907
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,910
We come from Bulgaria.

908
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:44,748
Things are very bad there.

909
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:47,116
The devil has the people
by the throat.

910
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:50,048
So Jan and I, we...

911
01:05:50,226 --> 01:05:52,922
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

912
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:55,495
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

913
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:58,065
But we haven't much money...

914
01:05:58,234 --> 01:06:00,702
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

915
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,129
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

916
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,671
And then Captain Renault sees us...

917
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,844
...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I' II bet.

918
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:12,205
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

919
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:14,014
But we have no money.

920
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:15,909
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

921
01:06:16,085 --> 01:06:18,417
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

922
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:21,557
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

923
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:23,751
He always has.

924
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:30,956
You are a man.

925
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:33,796
If someone loved you very much...

926
01:06:34,003 --> 01:06:38,235
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

927
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:41,675
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

928
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:45,272
...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

929
01:06:45,448 --> 01:06:49,282
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

930
01:06:49,452 --> 01:06:51,249
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

931
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,548
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

932
01:06:54,057 --> 01:06:55,149
Go back to Bulgaria.

933
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:59,623
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

934
01:07:00,863 --> 01:07:04,959
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

935
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:08,570
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

936
01:07:08,738 --> 01:07:11,138
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

937
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:14,469
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

938
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:24,483
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

939
01:07:24,654 --> 01:07:28,181
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

940
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:31,589
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

941
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:35,324
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

942
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:37,863
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

943
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:40,692
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

944
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,633
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,602
Right this way, if you please.

946
01:07:44,774 --> 01:07:48,540
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

947
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:50,040
Thank you.

948
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:02,083
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

949
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:27,741
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

950
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,013
No. No, I guess not.

951
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:32,051
Have you tried 22 tonight?

952
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:35,022
I said 22.

953
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:52,705
Leave it there.

954
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:09,555
Cash it in and don't come back.

955
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,319
Are you sure this place is honest?

956
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:18,731
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

957
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,002
How are we doing tonight?

958
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:26,001
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

959
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,680
Monsieur Rick...

960
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,346
He's just a lucky guy.

961
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:43,958
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

962
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:46,185
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

963
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:51,189
Captain Renault, may l- -?

964
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:55,326
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

965
01:09:55,505 --> 01:09:58,235
- We'll be there at 6.
- I' II be there at 10.

966
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,272
I'm very happy for both of you.

967
01:10:00,443 --> 01:10:02,536
Still, it's very strange that you won.

968
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:04,976
Well, maybe not so strange.

969
01:10:05,147 --> 01:10:07,980
- I' II see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

970
01:10:08,384 --> 01:10:09,976
No!

971
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:18,592
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

972
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:21,796
Go away, you crazy Russian.

973
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:35,507
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

974
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,873
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

975
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,911
Put it down as a gesture to love.

976
01:10:40,082 --> 01:10:41,606
Well, I' II forgive you this time.

977
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:44,650
But I' II be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

978
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,015
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

979
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:54,221
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

980
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,022
Well, isn't there some other place?

981
01:10:56,232 --> 01:10:58,723
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

982
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:02,933
- In my office.
- Right.

983
01:11:04,006 --> 01:11:06,668
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

984
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:09,834
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

985
01:11:10,012 --> 01:11:11,775
You know what I' ve been doing.

986
01:11:11,948 --> 01:11:15,884
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

987
01:11:16,052 --> 01:11:18,316
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

988
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:19,920
I'm not interested in politics.

989
01:11:20,089 --> 01:11:22,580
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

990
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:23,950
I'm a saloonkeeper.

991
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:27,854
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

992
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,554
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

993
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:32,599
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

994
01:11:32,768 --> 01:11:35,931
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

995
01:11:36,138 --> 01:11:38,072
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

996
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,504
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

997
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:44,043
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

998
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:47,080
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

999
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,975
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1000
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:51,983
My answer would still be the same.

1001
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:54,315
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1002
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:55,649
There is.

1003
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,252
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1004
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:01,189
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1005
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:03,964
- My wife?
- Yes.

1006
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:46,364
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1007
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:06,411
See what I mean? If Laszlo 's presence in
a cafe can inspire this demonstration...

1008
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:09,057
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1009
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:11,216
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1010
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:14,463
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1011
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:15,824
The place is to be closed.

1012
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:19,058
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1013
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:25,600
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1014
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,071
This cafe is closed until further notice.

1015
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,902
Clear the room at once.

1016
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:34,714
How can you close me up?

1017
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:38,375
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1018
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:40,454
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1019
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:41,885
Everybody out at once.

1020
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:50,264
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1021
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:53,230
This morning you implied it wasrt safe
to leave Casablanca.

1022
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:56,337
That is also true, except for one destination:
Occupied France.

1023
01:14:56,539 --> 01:14:59,440
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1024
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:00,664
Of what value is that?

1025
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:03,869
You may recall what German guarantees
have been won'th in the past.

1026
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:07,311
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1027
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:11,783
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1028
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:13,046
The other alternative?

1029
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:17,989
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1030
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,491
Good night, mademoiselle.

1031
01:15:30,206 --> 01:15:33,698
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1032
01:15:56,632 --> 01:15:58,623
Our faithful friend is still there.

1033
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:01,693
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1034
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:03,029
I must.

1035
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:06,663
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1036
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:10,175
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I' m frightened.

1037
01:16:10,379 --> 01:16:12,210
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1038
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,815
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1039
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:16,644
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1040
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:19,714
Whatever I' d say,
you would carry on.

1041
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:23,524
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1042
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:26,058
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1043
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,786
But no intention of selling them.

1044
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:31,660
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1045
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:33,392
Did he give any reason?

1046
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:36,867
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1047
01:16:37,072 --> 01:16:39,233
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1048
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:41,972
I don't know why he said that.

1049
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:57,253
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1050
01:16:58,627 --> 01:17:00,458
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1051
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:05,022
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1052
01:17:06,302 --> 01:17:08,566
When I was in the concentration camp...

1053
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:11,663
...were you lonely in Paris?

1054
01:17:13,142 --> 01:17:15,133
Yes, Victor, I was.

1055
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:19,080
I know how it is to be lonely.

1056
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:22,481
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1057
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:26,477
No, Victor, there isn't.

1058
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:33,651
Ilove you very much, my dear.

1059
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:38,990
Yes, I know.

1060
01:17:39,835 --> 01:17:42,269
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1061
01:17:42,438 --> 01:17:45,134
You don't even have to say it.

1062
01:17:45,307 --> 01:17:47,070
I'll believe.

1063
01:17:49,178 --> 01:17:50,509
Good night, dear.

1064
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:53,845
Good night.

1065
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,551
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1066
01:18:08,864 --> 01:18:10,229
Be careful.

1067
01:18:11,834 --> 01:18:13,392
Of course I' II be careful.

1068
01:18:56,745 --> 01:18:59,942
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1069
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:01,912
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1070
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:03,881
Two weeks, maybe three.

1071
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:06,316
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1072
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:08,752
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1073
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:10,289
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1074
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:13,826
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1075
01:19:14,396 --> 01:19:17,229
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl
- I will.

1076
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:20,527
- Then I am going to the meeting...
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1077
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:21,896
I won't.

1078
01:19:23,072 --> 01:19:24,130
Good night.

1079
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:26,866
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1080
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:46,926
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1081
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:50,429
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1082
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:51,827
Well, won't you sit down?

1083
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:55,936
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1084
01:19:56,105 --> 01:19:59,404
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1085
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:02,304
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1086
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:05,106
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1087
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,840
I went all through that
with your husband. It 's no deal.

1088
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:10,146
I know how you feel about me...

1089
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:13,083
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1090
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:15,723
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1091
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,882
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1092
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,391
It was your cause too.

1093
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:22,063
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1094
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:25,194
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1095
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:27,425
I'm the only cause I' m interested in.

1096
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:37,536
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you...

1097
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:40,648
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1098
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:44,274
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth...

1099
01:20:44,453 --> 01:20:46,512
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1100
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:49,714
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1101
01:20:53,962 --> 01:20:56,692
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1102
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:59,629
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1103
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:04,365
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1104
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,065
You're a coward and a weakling.

1105
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:13,346
No. Oh, Richard. I' m sorry.

1106
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:17,385
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1107
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:20,249
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1108
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:21,478
What of it?

1109
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:24,319
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1110
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:32,997
Now, if you'll...

1111
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,667
All right.

1112
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:38,863
I tried to reason with you.

1113
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:41,271
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1114
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:44,805
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1115
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:48,246
Put them on the table.

1116
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:51,141
No.

1117
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,347
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1118
01:21:55,657 --> 01:21:59,650
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1119
01:22:01,063 --> 01:22:03,054
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1120
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,197
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1121
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:16,009
Richard...

1122
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:18,544
...I tried to stay away.

1123
01:22:18,914 --> 01:22:21,576
I thought I would never see you again.

1124
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:25,186
That you were out of my life.

1125
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,465
The day you left Paris...

1126
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:51,035
...if you knew what I went through.

1127
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:55,376
If you knew how much I loved you.

1128
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:59,218
How much I still love you.

1129
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:14,125
And then?

1130
01:23:16,171 --> 01:23:20,505
It wasrt long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1131
01:23:20,676 --> 01:23:24,203
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1132
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,108
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1133
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:28,909
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1134
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:32,417
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1135
01:23:32,688 --> 01:23:33,916
Then it came.

1136
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,283
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1137
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:40,083
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1138
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:42,929
Then I met you.

1139
01:23:43,265 --> 01:23:46,598
Why werert you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1140
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:49,862
It wasrt my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1141
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:52,597
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1142
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:56,010
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1143
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:59,510
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1144
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:01,205
...and for those working with us.

1145
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,182
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1146
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,745
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1147
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,357
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1148
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:13,653
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1149
01:24:13,995 --> 01:24:15,986
He was sick. He needed me.

1150
01:24:17,566 --> 01:24:20,194
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1151
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:24,328
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1152
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:27,103
Well...

1153
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,103
...well, you know the rest.

1154
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,140
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1155
01:24:35,317 --> 01:24:36,443
What about now?

1156
01:24:37,686 --> 01:24:38,675
Now?

1157
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:41,012
I don't know.

1158
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:44,716
I know that I' II never have the strength
to leave you again.

1159
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:46,985
And Laszlo?

1160
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:50,593
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1161
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:54,099
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1162
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:55,759
All except one.

1163
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,672
He won't have you.

1164
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:02,572
I can't fight it anymore.

1165
01:25:04,346 --> 01:25:06,678
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1166
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,711
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1167
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:14,947
You have to think for both of us.

1168
01:25:15,957 --> 01:25:17,356
For all of us.

1169
01:25:20,962 --> 01:25:23,624
All right. I will.

1170
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:29,464
Here's looking at you, kid.

1171
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:34,367
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1172
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,814
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1173
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:52,153
- I' m afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1174
01:25:56,465 --> 01:26:01,334
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1175
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,333
Thank you.

1176
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:22,950
Carl, what happened?

1177
01:26:23,124 --> 01:26:26,753
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1178
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:29,260
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1179
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:32,730
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1180
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:35,630
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1181
01:26:36,338 --> 01:26:38,568
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1182
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:49,740
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1183
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:03,857
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1184
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:05,795
This might come in handy.

1185
01:27:06,001 --> 01:27:07,093
Thank you.

1186
01:27:07,335 --> 01:27:09,929
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1187
01:27:11,973 --> 01:27:14,703
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's won'th all this?

1188
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,810
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1189
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:19,905
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1190
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:21,639
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1191
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:24,250
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1192
01:27:24,419 --> 01:27:26,683
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1193
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:29,016
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1194
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:33,354
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1195
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:37,123
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1196
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:40,191
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1197
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:43,629
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1198
01:27:43,838 --> 01:27:45,396
...and that you'll never succeed.

1199
01:27:45,574 --> 01:27:47,804
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1200
01:27:49,611 --> 01:27:52,205
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1201
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:54,776
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1202
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:56,746
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1203
01:27:56,918 --> 01:27:59,819
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1204
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:02,149
The first evening I came into this cafe...

1205
01:28:02,324 --> 01:28:04,690
...I knew there was something
between you and llsa.

1206
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:07,154
Since no one is to blame...

1207
01:28:07,596 --> 01:28:09,587
...I demand no explanation.

1208
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:13,063
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1209
01:28:13,234 --> 01:28:14,792
All right.

1210
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,904
But I want my wife to be safe.

1211
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:18,605
I ask you as a favor...

1212
01:28:18,773 --> 01:28:21,708
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1213
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:22,968
You love her that much?

1214
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:25,942
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1215
01:28:26,581 --> 01:28:29,106
Well, I am also a human being.

1216
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:31,441
Yes, I love her that much.

1217
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:40,557
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1218
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,254
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1219
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:44,420
On what charge?

1220
01:28:44,599 --> 01:28:46,794
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1221
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:49,698
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1222
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:05,647
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1223
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,881
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1224
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:13,084
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1225
01:29:13,261 --> 01:29:14,728
If you were to help him escape...

1226
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:17,330
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1227
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:19,967
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1228
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:23,229
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1229
01:29:23,438 --> 01:29:26,498
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1230
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:28,540
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1231
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,109
They're all excellent reasons.

1232
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:32,212
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1233
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:35,838
In this matter I' m powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1234
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:40,746
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1235
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:42,412
Yes, I have the letters.

1236
01:29:42,624 --> 01:29:44,421
But I intend using them myself.

1237
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:48,353
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1238
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:51,590
And I' m taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1239
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:53,734
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1240
01:29:53,902 --> 01:29:57,497
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1241
01:29:57,672 --> 01:29:59,697
The last man I want to see in America.

1242
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:03,138
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1243
01:30:03,311 --> 01:30:06,474
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1244
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:09,276
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1245
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:13,682
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to llsa and me.

1246
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:15,890
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1247
01:30:16,057 --> 01:30:19,584
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1248
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:23,128
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo 's wife.

1249
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:25,994
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1250
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,691
Louis, I' II make a deal with you.

1251
01:30:27,869 --> 01:30:31,396
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1252
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:34,838
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1253
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:37,603
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1254
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:39,940
Germany...
Vichy would be very grateful.

1255
01:30:40,148 --> 01:30:41,172
Then release him.

1256
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:43,977
You be at my place a half -hour
before the plane leaves.

1257
01:30:44,152 --> 01:30:46,677
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1258
01:30:46,888 --> 01:30:49,482
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1259
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:52,056
You get him, and we get away.

1260
01:30:52,227 --> 01:30:55,128
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1261
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,128
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1262
01:30:58,333 --> 01:31:01,029
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1263
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:03,534
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1264
01:31:03,705 --> 01:31:06,333
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1265
01:31:06,941 --> 01:31:09,341
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1266
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:12,378
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1267
01:31:12,547 --> 01:31:17,007
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1268
01:31:17,285 --> 01:31:18,547
Oh, thanks.

1269
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:20,279
Go ahead, Ricky.

1270
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:24,857
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1271
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:27,358
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1272
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:37,529
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1273
01:31:37,705 --> 01:31:40,970
Certainly not good enough.
But since I' m in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1274
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:44,609
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1275
01:31:44,813 --> 01:31:50,217
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1276
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:53,183
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's won'th 25.

1277
01:31:53,354 --> 01:31:56,323
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1278
01:31:56,524 --> 01:31:58,958
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1279
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:00,458
Well, so long.

1280
01:32:00,628 --> 01:32:03,654
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 can'tons of American cigarettes.

1281
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:06,323
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1282
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:44,032
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1283
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:45,502
...so I knew I' d be on time.

1284
01:32:45,673 --> 01:32:48,699
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1285
01:32:48,877 --> 01:32:50,970
This place will never be
the same without you.

1286
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:54,706
I know what you mean. But I' ve spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1287
01:32:54,883 --> 01:32:57,613
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1288
01:32:57,785 --> 01:32:59,980
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1289
01:33:00,154 --> 01:33:01,314
Sam's piano.

1290
01:33:02,056 --> 01:33:03,990
Serves me right for not being musical.

1291
01:33:04,259 --> 01:33:05,283
Here they are.

1292
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:07,522
You better wait in my office.

1293
01:33:17,238 --> 01:33:19,832
Victor thinks I' m leaving with him.
Havert you told him?

1294
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:22,442
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1295
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,975
Everything is quite all right.

1296
01:33:24,145 --> 01:33:27,171
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1297
01:33:27,348 --> 01:33:29,179
Please trust me.

1298
01:33:31,219 --> 01:33:32,447
Yes, I will.

1299
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:41,755
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1300
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:46,658
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1301
01:33:47,068 --> 01:33:48,968
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1302
01:33:49,137 --> 01:33:52,436
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It 's all arranged.

1303
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:54,939
Good. I' ve got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1304
01:33:55,109 --> 01:33:57,543
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1305
01:33:57,712 --> 01:33:59,111
Victor Laszlo.

1306
01:33:59,647 --> 01:34:02,377
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1307
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:08,979
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1308
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:12,821
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1309
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:15,996
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank...

1310
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:21,235
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1311
01:34:21,402 --> 01:34:23,393
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1312
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,698
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1313
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:27,738
...but I will if you take one more step.

1314
01:34:28,443 --> 01:34:30,673
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1315
01:34:33,915 --> 01:34:37,407
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1316
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:39,712
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1317
01:34:39,887 --> 01:34:41,479
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1318
01:34:41,656 --> 01:34:44,284
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1319
01:34:44,459 --> 01:34:46,859
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1320
01:34:47,028 --> 01:34:49,121
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1321
01:34:56,671 --> 01:34:58,730
Hello? Is that the airport?

1322
01:35:00,041 --> 01:35:01,702
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1323
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:04,469
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1324
01:35:04,645 --> 01:35:06,442
There's to be no trouble about them.

1325
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:07,870
Good.

1326
01:35:08,316 --> 01:35:09,476
Hello?

1327
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:15,988
My car, quickly!

1328
01:35:17,658 --> 01:35:18,750
This is Major Strasser.

1329
01:35:18,926 --> 01:35:21,394
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1330
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:22,859
At once, do you hear?

1331
01:35:30,004 --> 01:35:32,029
Hello, radio tower?

1332
01:35:32,206 --> 01:35:35,300
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1333
01:35:35,576 --> 01:35:38,044
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1334
01:35:38,212 --> 01:35:42,148
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1335
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:45,046
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1336
01:35:57,565 --> 01:36:00,295
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1337
01:36:00,468 --> 01:36:02,231
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1338
01:36:02,437 --> 01:36:05,838
- Find Laszlo 's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1339
01:36:06,007 --> 01:36:06,996
This way, please.

1340
01:36:08,876 --> 01:36:12,004
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1341
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,205
You think of everything, don't you?

1342
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:16,816
And the names are
Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1343
01:36:17,018 --> 01:36:20,579
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1344
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:22,347
I don't understand.
What about you?

1345
01:36:22,523 --> 01:36:24,616
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1346
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,783
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

1347
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:28,758
Last night we said a great many things.

1348
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:30,830
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1349
01:36:30,998 --> 01:36:33,660
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1350
01:36:33,835 --> 01:36:36,497
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1351
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:38,502
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1352
01:36:38,673 --> 01:36:41,574
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1353
01:36:41,742 --> 01:36:45,041
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1354
01:36:45,213 --> 01:36:47,477
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1355
01:36:47,648 --> 01:36:51,084
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I' m saying it because it's true.

1356
01:36:51,285 --> 01:36:53,515
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1357
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:56,054
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1358
01:36:56,224 --> 01:36:59,091
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1359
01:36:59,293 --> 01:37:02,785
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1360
01:37:03,664 --> 01:37:05,757
But what about us?

1361
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:07,332
We'll always have Paris.

1362
01:37:07,502 --> 01:37:10,494
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1363
01:37:10,905 --> 01:37:12,566
We got it back last night.

1364
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:17,240
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1365
01:37:17,745 --> 01:37:19,235
But I' ve got a job to do too.

1366
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:23,178
Where I' m going, you can't follow.
What I' ve got to do you can't be any part of.

1367
01:37:23,784 --> 01:37:25,308
Ilsa, I' m no good at being noble.

1368
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:28,944
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1369
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:31,819
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1370
01:37:31,993 --> 01:37:34,518
Someday you'll understand that.

1371
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:37,459
Now, now.

1372
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,398
Here's looking at you, kid.

1373
01:37:56,551 --> 01:37:59,042
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1374
01:37:59,287 --> 01:38:01,414
There's something you should know.

1375
01:38:01,656 --> 01:38:03,453
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1376
01:38:03,624 --> 01:38:06,718
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1377
01:38:06,894 --> 01:38:08,759
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1378
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:11,797
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1379
01:38:11,966 --> 01:38:15,402
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, llsa?

1380
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:17,064
Yes.

1381
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:19,263
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1382
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,967
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1383
01:38:23,144 --> 01:38:25,669
But that was all over long ago.

1384
01:38:25,846 --> 01:38:29,111
For your sake, she pretended it wasrt,
and I let her pretend.

1385
01:38:29,617 --> 01:38:31,244
I understand.

1386
01:38:31,419 --> 01:38:33,614
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1387
01:38:34,322 --> 01:38:36,119
I appreciate it.

1388
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,754
Welcome back to the fight.

1389
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,485
This time I know our side will win.

1390
01:38:55,209 --> 01:38:57,370
Are you ready, llsa?

1391
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:00,612
Yes, I' m ready.

1392
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,116
Goodbye, Rick.

1393
01:39:05,987 --> 01:39:07,887
God bless you.

1394
01:39:09,223 --> 01:39:11,919
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1395
01:39:29,977 --> 01:39:31,911
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1396
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:34,912
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1397
01:39:35,082 --> 01:39:36,413
What you just did for Laszlo.

1398
01:39:36,584 --> 01:39:38,984
That fairy tale you invented
to send llsa away with him.

1399
01:39:39,153 --> 01:39:41,485
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1400
01:39:41,689 --> 01:39:43,714
But she knew you were lying.

1401
01:39:43,891 --> 01:39:45,825
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1402
01:39:45,993 --> 01:39:50,293
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1403
01:39:50,464 --> 01:39:53,956
- I' II have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1404
01:40:01,008 --> 01:40:05,342
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1405
01:40:07,915 --> 01:40:10,008
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1406
01:40:10,184 --> 01:40:12,209
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1407
01:40:14,522 --> 01:40:17,355
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1408
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:20,823
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I' m willing to shoot you.

1409
01:40:22,797 --> 01:40:24,355
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1410
01:40:24,532 --> 01:40:26,397
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1411
01:40:41,449 --> 01:40:43,007
Major Strasser has been shot.

1412
01:40:47,788 --> 01:40:50,416
Round up the usual suspects.

1413
01:41:14,148 --> 01:41:17,811
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1414
01:41:17,985 --> 01:41:20,146
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1415
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:22,551
I think perhaps you're right.

1416
01:41:47,348 --> 01:41:51,045
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1417
01:41:51,218 --> 01:41:53,652
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1418
01:41:53,821 --> 01:41:57,621
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1419
01:41:57,858 --> 01:41:59,086
I could use a trip.

1420
01:41:59,293 --> 01:42:02,558
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1421
01:42:02,797 --> 01:42:05,698
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1422
01:42:05,866 --> 01:42:07,094
"Our" expenses?

1423
01:42:07,935 --> 01:42:12,133
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

1424
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:36,749
