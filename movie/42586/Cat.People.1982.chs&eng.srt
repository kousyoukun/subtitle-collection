45
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,990
她把名字念成"菲玛莉"

46
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,790
这样  我又成了"菲玛莉"

检测以后  给这头新的豹子多点空间
After testing, we'll give this new leopard extra space.

199
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,100
-你要让它老实  -什么意思
- You'll have to disarm him. - What's that?

200
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,730
没什么  锯掉爪子

把尖牙锯掉

没有别的办法吗
Aren't there any other alternatives?

207
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,620
它不好饲养
Not really. He's no good for breeding.

208
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,140
若卖给别的动物园
We tried trading it to another zoo

209
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,870
他们也不会接受
but they wouldn't take it.

210

-那你就给它打一针  -杀掉它

我能忍受无资金无人手
I'll put up with no budget

214
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,550
以及这个糟糕的地方
and no staff and this place falling apart

215
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,930
但是我不能忍受无用的家伙
but I will not put up with that crap!

216
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,810
好了  冷静点  不过说说罢了
Fine, calm down, I only asked.

217
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,480
我们有只贪吃的豹子
We have a gourmet leopard.

218
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,440
乔在它的呕吐物里发现有披萨
He threw up, Joe found pizza in the vomitus.

豹子吃披萨
Leopards eat pizza?

221
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,760
它也许去按摩院之前
He probably raided a garbage can

222
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,330
扫荡了垃圾箱
before the massage parlour.

223
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,790
-看来它并不饿  -也许是发情期
- He didn't go there out of hunger. - Maybe he was horny.

224
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,500
这有可能  还有别的吗
Always a possibility. Anything else?

225
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,430
没有  无寄生虫  无瘟热
Nothing, no worms, no distemper.

226

它的主人照顾得不错
His owner takes good care of him.

227
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,380
的确  它很威风
Sure does. He's a superb cat.

228
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,010
威风  那是"威胁"
A superb cat? He's a menace.

229
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,310
不是梦境  高贵的女士
Not dreaming, noble lady

230
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,940
我被奇异的伪装所迷惑
Whence it is that I am taken with strange semblances...

231
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,200
如此清楚地见到你的脸
Seeing thy face, which is so fair to see

232
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,450
别人不能容忍我
Or else compassion would not suffer me

233
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,410
流言蜚语使我悲伤
To grieve my heart with such...

234
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,210
别人不能容忍我
With such... Or else compassion would not suffer me

235
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,340
流言蜚语使我悲伤
To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs...

236
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,380
他非凡的才能
And bears his mastership so mightily

237
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,470
抚慰我所有的不安
That all my troubled senses he thrusts out

238
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,510
有些减少  而有些消逝
Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some

239
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,840
直至全无
Till none but he is left

240
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,890
他仍留下眷顾着你
and has free range to gaze on thee.

241
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,310
使我的脸...

251
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,160
你跑什么
Why did you run away?

252
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,460
-你吓着我了  -不怕豹子
- You scared me. - But the leopard doesn't?

-你能意识到一种动物的感觉  -你能吗
- You can sense how an animal feels. - Oh, you can?

254

有时我们心心相印
Sometimes we're all connected.

255
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,420
你是谁
Who are you?

256
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,180
艾伦娜・加利欧  你呢

我是这里的馆长

258
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,810
动物园已关闭一个半小时了
The zoo's been closed for an hour and a half.

259

只顾游玩  忘记吃东西

267
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,560
刚才被你一追
and when you started chasing me

268
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,240
有点惊吓过度
I just got overexcited.

269

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,340
有时  他们也不坏
Occasionally they're compatible.

407
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,930
-我不这么认为  -为什么
- I wouldn't know. - How come?

408
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,930
我还从没遇到过想与之上床的
I never met anybody I liked enough to have sex with.

409
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,310
-从没有  -至今没有
- Never? - Not so far, no.

410
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,270
真的  那你还是处女
Really? You're still a virgin?

411
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,320
拜托  小声点
Come on, don't make it sound so perverse.

412
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,780
没关系
Not at all. Just

413
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,450
只是不理解  尤其是这年月
incomprehensible, maybe, especially these days.

414
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,330
噢  是的...
Oh, it's...

415
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,710
一定亲近过一两次
You must have come close, once or twice.

416
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,380
-有过一两次  -如何亲近
- Yeah, once or twice. - How close?

417
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,960
说来听听
Oh, come on.

418
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,380
原先与父母住在一起
The first parents I lived with,

419
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,970
母亲很好  但父亲是...
the mother was OK but the father was a...

420
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,390
-色鬼  -常摸我
- A lech? - He used to grab me.

421
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,890
-上面还是下面  -下面
- Overhand or underhand? - Underhand.

422
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,270
-我明白了  -还有一个男孩...
- I know the type. - There was this one boy...

423
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,190
-米・赫玛娜  -什么
- Mi hermana. - What?

424
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,650
米・赫玛娜
Mi hermana.

425
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,280
你的朋友
Friend of yours?

426
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,450
不是  我从没见过  她说什么
No, I never saw her before. What did she say?

427
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,540
米・赫玛娜  我的妹妹
Mi hermana, my sister.

428
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,880
也许喝多了  那后来呢
She was probably drunk. So what happened?

429
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,760
-刚才说什么来着  -你喜欢的男孩
- Erm, what? I don't remember. - The boy you liked.

430
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,050
对  我们互相爱抚
Oh, right. So, we petted and stuff like that.

431
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,220
他尝试各种姿势  而我...
He wanted to go all the way and so did I but...

432
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,140
-我有些害怕  他看起来... -怎么
- I got scared. He looked so... - What?

433
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,400
-很大  -他叫什么名字  是个急性子
- Huge. - God, what's his name, quick?

434
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,610
我想我太浪漫了
I guess I'm a romantic at heart.

435
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,150
有时会这样  不可思议
When it's right, it'll happen. It'll be magical.

436
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,320
我不觉得奇怪
I'm not knocking it.

437
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,910
为不可思议干杯
Here's to the magic.

438
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,310
每个官僚都一样
It's the same with every bureaucracy.

439
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,270
你不怎样做
You have things worked out then

440
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,190
他们也不理会你
they won't meet you halfway.

441
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,610
猫咪  有什么新鲜事  哼嗬
What's new, pussycat? Whoa-ho-ho

442
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,950
猫咪  有什么新鲜事  哼哈嗬
What's new, pussycat? Whoa-ha-ho-ho-ho-ho

443
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,830
猫咪  猫咪  我爱你
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you

444
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,290
噢  我爱
Yes, I do

445
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,500
你和你的猫咪...
You and your pussycat... smell

446
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,210
来吧  伙计  我帮你冲洗
Come on, fella, I gotta clean out the bunker.

447
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,470
干净了对你有好处  动一动
Clean it out, it'll be real nice for you. Move it!

448
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,780
到后面去
You're supposed to be in the back.

449
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,680
退到门后去
Back through the door, guy.

450
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,890
-它不合作  -它害怕
- Won't cooperate. - He's afraid.

451
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,690
来吧  来吧
Come on, come on!

452
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,940
嘿  挪一挪
Hey, move, move it!

453
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,120
快点
Come on, come on!

454
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,580
小心  往后
Careful, careful! Stay back.

455
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,380
喂  快点  退后  请往后
Hey, come on! Would you back up, please?

456
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,970
-到... 嘿  奥利佛  -什么事
- Go through the... Hey, Oliver! - Yeah!

457
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,220
拿电棒来  它在发狂
Bring the prod, he's going apeshit.

458
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,970
趴下
Simmer down!

459
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,150
好了
Yeah, that's fine.

460
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,910
嘿  来啊
Hey! Come on!

461
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,780
哇  啊
Whoa! Ahh!

462
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,450
奥利佛
Oliver!

463
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,260
噢  天啦
Oh, God! Oh, God!

464
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,300
快叫医生
Call the paramedics! Call 'em, call 'em!

465
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,050
你不能这样
You shouldn't be doing this.

466
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,270
他才26岁
He was only 26 years old.

467
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,140
我们最好报告警察豹子跑了
We better tell the police the leopard's gone.

468
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,910
菲玛娜
Female?

469
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,210
菲玛娜
Female?

470
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,180
-保罗  你去哪里了  -监狱
- Paul! Paul, where were you? - In prison.

471
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,720
-监狱  为什么  -我被控有罪
- In prison? What for? - I was praying for the condemned.

472
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:48,110
保罗  抱歉  今天有人被害
Paul, oh, Paul, forgive me. I saw somebody killed today.

473
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,320
是我认识的人
Somebody I knew.

474
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,450
我不想你这样  但你做了
I didn't think you were ready but you are.

475
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,990
我看见你与他一起
I knew it when I saw you with him.

476
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,660
谁
Who?

477
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:06,500
-奥利佛  -你想与他交媾  是吗
- Oliver? - You want to fuck him, don't you?

478
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,460
你连做梦都在想  你在发骚
You dream about fucking him, your whole body burns.

479
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,580
刺激着你的神经
It burns all along your nerves,

480
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,880
在你的嘴  你的乳房
in your mouth, your breasts.

481
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,470
-两腿间都湿润了  -住嘴
- You go wet between your legs. - Stop it!

482
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,680
每当这样  你告诉自己这是爱
Every time it happens you tell yourself that it's love,

483
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,640
但并非如此
but it isn't.

484
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,940
而是流血  死亡
It's blood. Death.

485
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,730
没有我  你无法逃避恶梦
You can't escape the nightmare without me.

486
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,150
没有你  我也无法逃避
And I can't escape without you.

487
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,740
我等你很久了
I've waited a long time for you.

488
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,660
保罗  别碰我
Paul, don't you touch me!

489
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,890
只有我能碰你
But I'm the only one who can touch you

490
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,080
也只有你才能碰我
and only you can touch me.

491
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,170
我们在一起安全  因为我俩是同类
We're safe together because we're the same.

492
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,090
谁跟你同类
I'm not like you!

493
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,220
你是的  你清楚
Oh, yes, you are. You've always known it.

494
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,970
记得小时候吗
Do you remember, when you were a child,

495
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,720
动物都能叫你的名字
the animals used to call your name?

496
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,770
别人在睡梦中时而你是清醒的
And you knew in the dark when the others were dreaming

497
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,110
你从未真正睡着
and you could never get to sleep.

498
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,990
-你疯了  -不
- You're insane! - No.

499
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,150
我没有
No, I'm not.

500
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,780
我没有爱
I'm not in love.

501
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:26,750
你想做什么  你想跃过这个圈吗
What will you do? Will you leap through his hoop?

502
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,210
你想一口咬掉我的头吗
Take his head in your mouth like an egg?

503
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,420
我需要你
I need you.

504
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:39,010
-你是谁  -我需要你
- Who are you? - I need you. I need you!

505
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,470
你不是我哥哥
Don't. You're not my brother.

506
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,680
噢
Oh!

507
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,270
不要
Don't!

508
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,120
停车
Stop!

509
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,790
怎么了  要帮助吗
What's wrong? Can I help you?

510
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,890
-真的没事吗  -没事
- You sure everything's OK? - Honest.

511
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,840
我以为刚才有人追我
I thought I was being chased,

512
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,270
现在可能已经跑了
it was just somebody out walking.

513
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,560
抱歉  我太紧张了  我害怕极了
I'm sorry I got so excited. I just got scared.

514
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,900
我会乐于向上级报告
All right. I'll be glad to write it up.

515
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,650
不  不用了  谢谢你
No! No, no, thank you.

516
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,660
比尔  没事吧
Everything all right, Bill?

517
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,450
是的  没有什么
Yeah, turned out to be nothing.

518
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:51,250
好吧
Good.

519
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,290
别叫  住嘴  白痴
Quiet! Shut up, idiot!

520
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,420
-怎么了  -我不知道
- What's wrong? - I don't know.

521
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,260
真奇怪  它好象发现了什么
Something strange. He senses something.

522
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,260
最好进去看看  我叫人过来
We'd better look into it. Let me call it in.

523
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,680
我在睡觉  没听到什么
I was sleeping, I didn't hear anything.

524
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,890
真的吗  嗯
Are you sure? Hm?

525
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,270
地下室有什么吗
What about the basement?

526
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,440
你什么也不知道吗
You don't know anything about that, either?

527
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,900
地下室  噢  我没去那里
Basement. Oh, I don't go there.

528
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,000
-研究室的那些人呢  -他们马上就到
- What about the guys at the lab? - They're on their way.

529
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,420
佩林小姐  亚茨博士  你们都在动物园工作
Miss Perrin, Dr Yates? You're with the zoo, right?

530
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,970
-是的  -跟我来  我想让你们来看看
- Yeah. - I want to show you something.

531
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,850
我们已发现豹子是从这里出去的
At least we know now where the leopard came from.

532
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,230
跟我来
Follow me.

533
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,860
-什么气味  -不知道
- What's that smell? - I don't know.

534
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,450
警犬闻到了这股强烈的气味
The dog picked up the scent real strong.

535
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:07,110
你们也见到了  它发狂了
You should've seen him. He went crazy.

536
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,710
这是几大块碎片
Look. There's three or four bodies in there.

537
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:17,460
-也许附近还有  -噢  天啦
- Probably more buried around. - Oh, God.

538
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,750
我想这是加利欧首次作案
I expect Gallier killed them first,

539
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,630
也许是一种宗教仪式
possibly in some ritual,

540
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,630
然后喂豹子
then fed them to the leopard.

541
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,050
几年前我们也发现过
We've found others over the years.

542
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,220
主要是妓女  女流浪者
Mostly prostitutes, runaways

543
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,180
吃掉一半  阴部撕裂

544
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,680
-为什么  -谁知道

545

加利欧从12岁起经常进出精神病院
Gallier's been in and out of psycho wards since he was 12.

546

他是一个宗教狂
He's a religious fanatic.

547
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:45,280
他从哪里找来的这种豹呢
Where could he possibly have found a cat like this?

548
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,360
他自己又怎样驯服它呢
And how could he have handled it by himself?

549
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:52,490
他10岁前  有人帮他轮流喂养
He was raised around them, at least until he was ten.

550
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,910
他父母是驯兽师

551
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,960
-他们突然死了  -与艾伦娜有关吗

552
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,780
你在暗示什么
What are you suggesting?

553
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,090
艾伦娜一周前才见到她哥哥
Irena only met her brother a week ago.

554
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:08,880
我们没有理由怀疑她
We have no reason to suspect her.

555
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,350
事实上  看来他也想杀她
In fact, it looked as if he planned to kill her too.

556
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,770
看来她得另找地方住
If I was her, I'd find me another place to live.

557
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,900
我会照看她
I'll take care of that.

558
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,610
-别碰我  -老实点  女士

559
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,000
把她带走
OK, take her in.

560
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,140
一支老式枪

I bought it two years ago, I've been fixing it ever since.

562
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,020
你要休息的话  去楼上的卧室
Room's upstairs if you want to lie down.

563
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,110
这个房间一直作为暗室
I've been using this room as a darkroom

564
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,210
所以有点乱
so it might be a little cluttered.

565
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,060
我得抓紧时间休息
I'm gonna grab a few hours' sleep.

566

有什么事  我就马上过来
If you need anything, I'll be right across the way.

568

他不是我哥哥
He couldn't be my brother.

569
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,950
我哥哥不会那样做
My brother wouldn't have done those things.

570
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:41,910
我也相信不是
No, I'm sure he wouldn't.

571
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,580
喔...晚安
Well... good night.

572
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,630

这是牛轭湖农场

576

改天为你买块地

577
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,750
把船卸下来
Let's get the boat.

578
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,260
划船游泳都行
Either that or we have to swim.

579
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
-解下来吗  -是的
- Open that? - Pardon me?

580
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,550
从这里解开吗
Loosen up here?

581
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:53,960
-嘿  奥利佛  -嘿  耶特曼

这是艾伦娜  这是耶特曼・布鲁尔
This is Irena. This is Yeatman Brewer.

She's mighty pretty. Let me help you with your bags.

587
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,150
耶特曼帮我建的这地方
Yeatman helped me build this place.

588

有时他也在这帮我消愁
He also helped me tear it apart a few nights...

589
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,370
轻点  可能是螃蟹
You draw this in real slow and there's a crab on here.

590
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:27,200
我把它拉过来  先别提出水面
Then I draw him across. Don't lift the net up.

591
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,460
别往上提  现在拉上来
Don't lift the net up. Now lift the net up.

594
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,170
拿过去  放到桶里
You take them and you dump them in that basket.

595
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,720
噢...碰到我了
Not... on me!

596
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:55,730
有一只要爬出来了
This one doesn't want to go out.

597
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,450
比莉  我和特德先回旅馆
Billie, me and Ted are going back to the hotel

比莉  你说会干什么
Is there anything you wouldn't do, Billie?

601
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,630
真闷
Look how dreary.

602
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,890
别动
Hold it right there.

603
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,520
抱歉  你是说我吗
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

612

它怕那种声音
They hate the sound.

613
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,940
我不能
I can't.

614
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,370
宝贝  高兴点  都发生了

你不会明白
You don't understand.

618
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,460
我明白
Sure I do.

619
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,760
你只是有点紧张
You're just a little nervous, that's all.

- Who was she? - Who knows? A tourist?

但愿你没吃早餐  来吧

保罗  同你一样他什么都没做
Paul? He has nothing to do with you.

648
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,220
我甚至不认为他是你哥哥
I don't even think he's your brother.

649
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,560
听着  艾伦娜

我都34岁了

即使我们永远不能睡在一起
Would you love me just as much

656
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,710
你也会这样爱我吗
if we could never sleep together?

657
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:09,260
-别说傻话  -真的

我怕
I'm afraid.

661
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,650
-我怕  -怕什么
- I'm afraid. - Of what?

662
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:31,150
-我怕你  -艾伦娜  你还不明白
- I'm afraid for you. - Irena, you don't understand.

-我很害怕  -我会永远爱你
- I'm afraid so much. - I'll always love you.

664

你一出世我就爱你
I loved you before you were born.

665
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,580
我不知道
I don't know.

666
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,500
进去吧
Come on.

667
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,550
豹子没死的话
The leopard's probably out of the parish

668
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,240
也已逃出了教区
by now unless he's dead.

669
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,430
眼见为实
I'll believe it when I see it.

670
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,870
我想你看不到了
I don't think you're gonna see it.

671
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:30,130
-什么意思  -州长已下令停止搜索
- What do you mean? - The Sheriff is gonna call it off.

672
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,430
我们缺乏人手又没时间
We can't afford the manpower or the time.

673
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,010
一个星期了
It's been a week.

674
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,590
你的意思呢
Are you out of your mind?

675
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,800
随便他们怎样
They did everything they could.

676
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:42,060
-它再行凶呢  -你别找借口了
- And when it kills again? - Don't give me that shit.

677
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,150
关在笼里时  你何不杀了它
You wouldn't shoot the bastard when we had him in a cage.

678
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,250
抱歉  我也不知道为何没杀它
Sorry, I don't know why I did that.

679
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,770
哼  你他妈的
Yeah, well, fuck you.

680
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,860
-他是对的  -他不对
- He's right. - No, he's not.

681
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,780
-你怎么知道  -什么
- How the hell would you know, huh? - What?

682
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,200
-为什么  -没什么
- What? - Nothing.

683
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,420
-艾伦娜怎么样了  -是的
- How's Irena feeling? - Fine.

684
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,390
-你会跟她谈吗  -谈什么
- You wanna talk about it? - Talk about what?

685
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,220
-天啦  你在想什么  -艾伦娜会没事的
- Jesus, what do you think? - Irena will be OK.

686
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:25,270
我甚至不...艾伦娜不用我担心
I don't even... Irena's not the one I'm worried about.

687
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,730
-她看起来很好  -什么意思
- Her type will always be OK. - What's that mean?

688
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:31,730
嘿  别当我没看见  奥利佛
Look, I'm not blind, Oliver.

689
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,860
你以前不是这样心神不定
I've seen you obsessed before, not like this.

690
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:40,530
我想你已经爱上她了
I even thought I'd seen you in love before my vanity.

691
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:43,790
-说点别的吧  -那好
- Let's talk about something else. - OK. All right.

692
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:46,160
我知道我在做什么
I know what I'm doing.

693
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,000
救救我
Save me.

694
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,210
只有你能让我停止杀人
Only you can stop this killing.

695
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,380
你必须跟我做爱
You've got to make love with me.

696
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:42,680
作为兄妹
As brother and sister.

697
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,800
从每个收养你的人那里
I searched for you for so long,

698
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,890
我找了你好久
from one foster home to another.

699
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:51,100
我们可以像夫妻一样生活
We can live together as mates.

700
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,650
就像父母他们一样
Just as our parents did.

701
01:14:55,690 --> 01:15:00,400
他们也是兄妹  你不是知道吗
You do know that they were brother and sister, don't you?

702
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:02,410
-不知道  -噢  是
- No. - Oh, yes.

703
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,750
跟我做爱就能拯救我们自己
Make love with me and save both of us.

704
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,250
不
No.

705
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,760
我跟你不一样
I'm not like you.

706
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,300
你这样做会害死你的情人
That's the lie that will kill your lover.

707
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,260
我至少可以减轻你的恐惧
At least let me spare you that horror.

708
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:38,940
来啊
Come on, come on.

709
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,200
-过来躺下  -不
- Come and lie next to me. - No.

710
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:55,000
奥利佛不爱你  他只关心那豹子
Oliver doesn't love you, he loves the panther.

711
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,550
他要你是因为内心的恐惧
He wants you because he fears you.

712
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,380
把他让给艾丽丝吧
Let Alice have him.

713
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,050
她认为他在充英雄
She thinks his fear is courage

714
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,970
而他却认为是爱
and he thinks his fear is love.

715
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,850
他们适合彼此
They were made for each other.

716
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,280
我们也是
So were we.

717
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,370
-握住我的手  -不
- Take my hand. - No.

718
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,800
除了我你别无选择
Then you leave me with no choice.

719
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,690
保罗  我听你的  好吗
Oh, Paul. I'll come with you, OK?

720
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,030
我们在一起  你和我
We'll go together, you and I, OK?

721
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,160
一切会好的
Lt'll be all right.

722
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,310
哦
Ah!

723
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,140
我煮点咖啡
I'm gonna make some coffee.

724
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:18,560
好的  我去取毛巾
Sure. I'll get some towels.

725
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,330
艾伦娜  我回来了
Irena, I'm back.

726
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:43,090
艾丽丝来了  你也来点咖啡
Alice is here. Why don't you join us for coffee?

727
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,010
艾伦娜
Irena?

728
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:04,940
奥利佛
Oliver!

729
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:27,630
艾丽丝
Alice!

730
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,970
奥利佛
Oliver?

731
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,760
艾丽丝  快把猎枪拿来
Alice, get the gun! Get the shotgun!

732
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:59,780
保罗...他死了吗
Paul he's dead?

733
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,160
你没有亲人了
Then you have no one.

734
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,450
我是谁
Who am I?

735
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,660
-我是谁  -嘘
- What am I? - Shh.

736
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:14,250
别问那些你已经知道的事
Don't ask what you already know.

737
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:18,170
菲玛娜  我不知道  我...
No, Female, I don't know, I...

738
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,420
我不知道该去哪里
I don't know where to go.

739
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:28,970
像他那样  在监狱  隐姓埋名
Live as he did hidden, in chains.

740
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,520
永远别去爱
Never love.

741
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:36,730
就当这世界像男人们想的那样
Pretend the world is what men think it is.

742
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,690
等等
Wait.

743
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:41,650
别这样扔下我
Don't leave me like this.

744
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,450
我不知道该去哪里
I don't know where to go.

745
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,660
去哪里没关系
It doesn't matter where you go,

746
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,910
知道吗
does it?

747
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:20,110
以下方向乘客现在登机：肯纳  诺科
Now taking passengers for Kenner, Norco,

748
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:22,230
拉普拉斯  格莱默西
LaPlace, Gramercy Junction,

749
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:27,950
冈萨雷斯  巴吞鲁日  坦布雷  密西西比
Gonzales, Baton Rouge and Timberlane, Mississippi.

750
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,990
去哪里
Where to?

751
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,790
这点钱能去多远
How far will that take me?

752
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,830
你想去哪里
Where do you want to go?

753
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:38,580
北边
North.

754
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,750
里士满
Richmond.

755
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,840
里士满
Richmond.

756
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:40,890
很久以前祖先们把孩子
Long ago, our ancestors sacrificed their children

757
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,880
供奉给美洲豹
to the leopards.

758
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:46,880
孩子的灵魂在豹子体内渐渐长大
The souls of the children grew inside the leopards

759
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,380
直到豹子演变为人类
until the leopards became human.

760
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,970
我们是神
We were gods then.

761
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,510
我们近亲繁衍后代
We are an incestuous race.

762
01:27:55,550 --> 01:28:01,480
我们只能近亲性交  否则就会变回原形
We can only make love with our own, otherwise we transform.

763
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,520
而在变成人之前  我们必须杀人
And before we can become human again, we must kill.

764
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:12,950
欢迎你们回来
Welcome home.

765
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,030
艾伦娜

What's wrong, Alice?

774
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,240
为何跟踪我
Why are you following me?

775
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:08,240
-跟踪你  -别不承认
- Following you? - Don't deny it!

776
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:14,210
-喂  什么事  -我知道你想杀我
- Hey, what's going on? - I know you want to kill me.

777
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:18,040
杀你  我在找奥利佛
Kill you? I was looking for Oliver.

778
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,550
我去医院找过他  他已经走了
I tried the hospital but he was already out.

779
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:26,430
抱歉  吓着你了
I'm sorry if I frightened you.

780
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:40,190
-嘿  怎么了  -没什么

781
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:30,800
-喂  -奥利佛

782
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,720
-喂  -你还好吧  我刚找过你

01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,020
-是吗  -奥利佛  艾伦娜今晚跟踪我
- Yeah. - Oliver, Irena followed me tonight.

784
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:39,960
我听到很恐怖的声音
This is gonna sound crazy

785
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,850
还以为她想害我
but I think she wanted to hurt me.

786
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,400
奥利佛...
Oliver...

787
01:35:49,530 --> 01:35:51,320
-奥利佛  -怎么

别  艾伦娜

793
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:21,650
奥利佛  附近发现豹子
Oliver, they spotted a leopard near the bridge.

794
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:23,690
