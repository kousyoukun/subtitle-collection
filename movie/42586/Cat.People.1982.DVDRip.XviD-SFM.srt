1
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:17,252
'Flight 85
now boarding at Gate 12B.

2
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:22,216
'Flight 85, final boarding call, 12B.'

3
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,218
Over to the right.

4
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:37,231
- Hi!
- Good to see you.

5
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:44,112
Hello. It's a beautiful day.
Would you contribute to the Lighthouse?

6
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,782
- Excuse me, sir, it's a...
- No, thanks.

7
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,578
Hello, would you care to
contribute to the Lighthouse?

8
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,122
Excuse me, sir, would you care to...

9
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:58,418
You're gonna get me?
I'll be outside by the taxis.

10
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,380
Right. Where you picked me up last time.

11
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,674
I'm Paul.

12
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,303
I'm Irena.

13
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,722
Yes, I know.

14
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,606
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

15
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,863
- How was your flight?
- Oh, I hate flying.

16
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,364
Oh!

17
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,325
- It scares me to death.
- It scares me too.

18
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,663
- You look really nice.
- Thank you.

19
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,790
Welcome to New Orleans.

20
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,586
I wanted to get here as fast as I could.

21
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,215
'Mr Al Curtis, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.'

22
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,092
We can get a taxi down there.

23
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,554
- Did you wait long?
- No, just a few minutes.

24
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:12,492
Ah, you're here at last! I'm so glad.

25
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:17,664
Oh, let me look at you.
Let me look at you.

26
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:23,587
Oh, your hair is so pretty!
Is that how they're doing the hair now?

27
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,090
- Female, this is my sister Irena.
- I can see that.

28
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:31,678
I'd know those Gallier eyes anywhere.
She's a lovely little thing.

29
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,598
He is driving me
crazy waiting for you.

30
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,725
Do I get the credit for that?

31
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,979
Female keeps me out of trouble.

32
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,358
That's a full-time job.
You better believe it.

33
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,196
- Fem...?
- Female, like tamale. F-e-m-a-l-e.

34
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,574
See, I was orphaned too.
You like this house?

35
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:56,745
They didn't know what name
to put on the birth certificate,

36
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,789
so they put "child, female".

37
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,959
The woman that raised me,
God rest her soul,

38
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,797
she didn't read English too good,
so she pronounced it "Femolly".

39
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,092
So, here I am. "Fee-male", "Femolly",

40
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,011
"Femolly", "Fee-male..."

41
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,853
# Faraway places

42
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,355
# With strange sounding names... #

43
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,191
Fate wrenched us
apart as children.

44
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,652
Thy mercy restores us here today.

45
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,738
For this mending,
we thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.

46
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,241
- Amen.
- Amen.

47
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,373
- Mmm.
- Watch out, this is hot.

48
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,587
Oh! I forgot to call
the Robinsons. I'm sorry.

49
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,300
- Why do you have to call now?
- They care about me.

50
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,927
Sit down, you can call after dinner.

51
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,222
This is Female's special gumbo.

52
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,475
Special gumbo tonight
from yesterday's chicken.

53
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,227
That's right.

54
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:07,274
I didn't want them to worry.
They've been really nice, you'd like them.

55
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:11,612
Janice works at the nursery school,
she has three children.

56
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:16,366
And Arnold is from the CPA, you know?
He's extremely mellow.

57
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,579
The only time he only loses his temper
is around April 15th and...

58
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,500
Did they ever tell you
how our parents died?

59
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,044
Yes.

60
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,589
What did they tell you about me?

61
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,136
Well, not much.

62
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:39,473
I knew I had a brother
but I was only four.

63
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,895
I used to fantasize about you
when I was in the orphanage.

64
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:48,232
- Fantasize?
- You know...

65
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:52,486
about you coming to
rescue me and things.

66
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,446
Daydreams.

67
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,115
Yes, I had the same dreams.

68
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,620
I've got a surprise for you.

69
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:05,040
- Remember our practices together?
- For what?

70
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,167
For the circus.

71
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,463
Uh-uh, I said it was a surprise.

72
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:17,261
No peeking, huh? No peeking.

73
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,185
Ta-da!

74
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,648
God!

75
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,956
The skeletons are out
of the closet now, eh?

76
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:52,504
When Grandfather started the circus,
he only had one wagon.

77
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,340
Oh, it was a beautiful two-tiered one.

78
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,802
- There's a picture of it somewhere. Here.
- Oh, yeah!

79
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,805
The apes were kept on top
and the cat underneath.

80
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:06,685
The chimp teased the cat by throwing
garbage down through the bars.

81
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,237
God, they look so young.

82
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,157
Mother looks so happy.

83
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,535
I envy you. I wish I'd known them.

84
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,463
"Some little mice sat in the barn to spin

85
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,882
"Pussy came by and popped her head in

86
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,510
"'What are you doing, my little men? '

87
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,264
- "'Weaving coats for gentlemen."'
- Very good!

88
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,392
"'Shall I come in
and cut your threads off?"'

89
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:52,439
"'Oh, no, kind sir,
we will snap our heads off."'

90
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,403
He's been waiting 45 minutes.

91
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,449
Fuck off! I had to get a baby-sitter.

92
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,160
Room three. Hurry up.

93
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,788
I'll take that.

94
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:17,209
"Baby-sitter". You're always late.

95
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,976
Sorry I'm late.

96
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,774
Hi, I'm Ruthie.

97
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:45,362
But you can call me anything you want
if the price is right.

98
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,489
A joke.

99
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:50,492
Doesn't cost anything extra to laugh.

100
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,997
Oh, I get it. Strong, silent type, huh?

101
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,334
Uh, you know the rules around here?

102
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,086
Guess not. OK.

103
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:07,217
A massage alone is $25
and for $25 that's all you get.

104
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,220
Tipping is allowed and appreciated,

105
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:14,808
if you want to negotiate
for something extra?

106
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,147
We take Mastercharge, Visa,
American Express but not for tips.

107
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,907
OK, that's not really true,
you can put tips on Visa if you want.

108
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,868
Eww!

109
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,447
Somebody help me!

110
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:34,137
Dr Yates, New Orleans Zoo.
Bill Searle called about a stray cat?

111
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,682
What took you so long? Go on inside.

112
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,604
- It's in here?
- Right there.

113
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,611
Oliver, you won't believe this.

114
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,365
What it is,
it's a goddamn black leopard.

115
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,659
We don't know where it came from.

116
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,495
It mauled a hooker last night.
She's OK.

117
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:02,207
We've got it trapped
in a room upstairs. Look at this.

118
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:07,004
- Candid Camera.
- Let's hear it for voyeurism.

119
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,882
- Strictly security.
- Where is he?

120
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,967
Back under the bed.

121
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:15,804
Scared the shit out of the john.
Guy split stark naked.

122
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,182
- Who'd notice here?
- How'd it get in?

123
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,934
- Fire escape?
- The window's got bars.

124
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,686
- Back door?
- Locked.

125
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,771
- The front.
- I'd have noticed.

126
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,902
- Wait. Look there.
- Holy shit!

127
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,113
- He's enormous.
- 125, 130 pounds.

128
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:37,451
More like 150.
He's big, all right, real big.

129
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:43,207
OK. Let's go with the ketamine.
2000 milligrams.

130
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:47,085
- Let's get him in the squeeze cage.
- Yeah, OK.

131
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,880
- Can we get to that window?
- Sure.

132
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,257
All right, let's go.

133
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,309
Bill?

134
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,437
With walkie-talkies
I can help from the monitor.

135
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,106
- Good idea.
- Can I borrow it? Thanks.

136
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,109
I shot the coyote in Baton Rouge.

137
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,653
- 2000 mg?
- Yeah.

138
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,739
- One ready if I miss? Full CO2 cartridge?
- Yeah.

139
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,950
- Got room?
- I'll make room.

140
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,411
- I'll hold the ladder.
- Hold the ladder.

141
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:30,045
- Be careless.
- You, too.

142
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,447
'Oliver, he knows you're there.'

143
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,159
I hear him. He doesn't sound overjoyed.

144
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:07,166
- What are you doing?
- 'Cleaning the window.'

145
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,376
- What?
- 'Cleaning the... '

146
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:20,304
Jesus Christ, he's going
through the goddamn window!

147
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,502
Jesus.

148
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,175
Paul!

149
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,849
Paul?

150
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,493
- How is he?
- It's OK. Come on.

151
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,884
'We only have an hour.

152
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,929
'Lf only I hadn't let you
set that clock, Benny.

153
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,223
'You didn't set the alarm.'

154
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,141
- Good morning.
- Morning.

155
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:52,646
- Where's Paul?
- They needed him early at the mission.

156
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,358
Oh, he was going to show me the sights.

157
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,279
Get yourself a guidebook -
they sell them all over town.

158
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,072
Go to the French Quarter,

159
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:05,617
have a good time
and don't worry about him.

160
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,370
Now, sit down.

161
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,956
Try some coffee.

162
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:14,376
I want to see if you like it with chicory.

163
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,962
Then I'll steam you some milk.

164
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,968
- You want some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

165
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,430
I'll fix you some breakfast, don't worry.

166
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,994
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Paul Gallier.

167
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,705
I don't believe he's in today.

168
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,041
Oh. I'm his sister.

169
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:23,755
Oh? Well, I can take you to his office
if you'd like to wait.

170
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,218
No, thank you. Thank you.

171
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:40,689
# Your soft lips... #
 'Wear it out for Brett Ti Yo.'

172
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,567
# All your feelings, yeah... #

173
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,780
'Oh, and I tremble,
I tremble, I tremble.'

174
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,325
# Up under my... #

175
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:55,204
Wear it out, Pope.
Wear it out. Wear it out.

176
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,373
- What's that over there?
- That's the zoo.

177
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,209
Oh, wait, I want to go in.

178
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,669
What for? Nothing but a dump.

179
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:07,257
You want a zoo? Go to the Bronx.
I'll take you to the French Quarter.

180
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,927
I've seen that, now, please stop!

181
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:13,263
- It's your money.
- Keep the change.

182
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,495
All right, children, stay in line.

183
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:49,675
Come on!
Jimmy, leave your brother alone.

184
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:42,811
He's not so dangerous in a cage.

185
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:46,607
After testing,
we'll give this new leopard extra space.

186
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:49,401
- You'll have to disarm him.
- What's that?

187
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:53,030
Not much. Cut its claws, root canals.

188
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,657
Er, file and crown its fangs.

189
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:59,119
A dentist in town does it. Radenauer.

190
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,747
- Tom Radenauer?
- Yeah, he does people too.

191
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:06,126
I know, he's my dentist.
Shit, we don't have the funds for this.

192
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:09,004
Aren't there any other alternatives?

193
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,924
Not really.
He's no good for breeding.

194
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:16,178
We tried trading it to another zoo
but they wouldn't take it.

195
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,056
- You could euthanize it.
- Kill it?

196
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:21,600
- Not acceptable.
- What would it cost?

197
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,352
- No.
- Can we discuss it?

198
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:27,856
I'll put up with no budget and no staff
and this place falling apart

199
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,234
but I will not put up with that crap!

200
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,111
Fine, calm down, I only asked.

201
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,785
We have a gourmet leopard.

202
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,746
He threw up,
Joe found pizza in the vomitus.

203
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:46,083
Yeah, I sure did. Ooh, pepperoni.

204
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,668
Leopards eat pizza?

205
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:51,630
He probably raided a garbage can
before the massage parlour.

206
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:55,092
- He didn't go there out of hunger.
- Maybe he was horny.

207
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,803
Always a possibility. Anything else?

208
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:02,474
Nothing, no worms, no distemper.
His owner takes good care of him.

209
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,685
Sure does. He's a superb cat.

210
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:08,313
A superb cat? He's a menace.

211
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,618
"'Not dreaming, noble lady

212
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,248
"'Whence it is that I am taken

213
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,501

223
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,749
Hey!

224
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,918
Wait a minute!

225
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:15,691
All right, do you wanna come on down?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

226
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,611
Watch out.

227
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,655
How'd you get up there?

228
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:27,703
- Here, let me help.
- I'm fine.

229
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,420
- What the hell were you doing?
- Sketching.

230
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,465
Sketching? That animal
shouldn't be out. Why did you run away?

231
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:43,760
- You scared me.
- But the leopard doesn't?

232
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:47,097
- You can sense how an animal feels.
- Oh, you can?

233
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,349
Sometimes we're all connected.

234
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,728
Who are you?

235
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,480
Irena Gallier. Who are you?

236
00:30:55,522 --> 00:31:00,110
I'm the curator here. The zoo's
been closed for an hour and a half.

237
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:10,787
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I feel dizzy.

238
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,212
You're burning up.
I'll get you something.

239
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,672
- Oh, no.
- Come on, I don't bite.

240
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,103
Here, take these.

241
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:39,066
- I don't believe in medicine.
- It's aspirin.

242
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:42,236
No, thank you. I'm exhausted, that's all.

243
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:48,617
I flew in the day before yesterday,
went sightseeing, forgot to eat

244
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:54,540
and when you started chasing me
I just got overexcited.

245
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:59,044
Yeah, well, I do sometimes
have that effect on women.

246
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:03,006
Oh, really?

247
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,010
No. That was a joke.

248
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:12,307
I don't wanna keep this on any more.

249
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,893
It's wetting up my hair. Thank you.

250
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,980
It'll reduce the temperature.

251
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,566
No, it's down already.

252
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,152
Feel.

253
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,705
Just because it feels cooler
doesn't mean the temperature's gone.

254
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,832
I'll go get a thermometer.

255
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,878
Oh, come on, please.
I've always had a weird metabolism.

256
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,509
Really.

257
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:52,389
I just need some food and I'm all right.

258
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,684
You wanna have some dinner with me?

259
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:59,563
Yeah, sure, great. If you feel up to it.

260
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,067
I feel hungry.

261
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,612
I know a reasonably good steak place.

262
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,697
I don't eat meat.

263
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:12,284
- You're on a diet.
- They're not that fattening!

264
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,244
Oh, sure.

265
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,455
You don't look like a curator.

266
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:19,541
I look exactly like a curator.

267
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,877
No, you don't.

268
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,213
You haven't met many curators.

269
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:27,508
I guess not.
What does a curator do?

270
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,969
Different things.
Buys animals, sells animals,

271
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,056
veterinary work, research, exhibits.

272
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,268
Maybe an expedition if he lucks out
on a donation or a grant.

273
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:43,649
- Expedition? Like, into the jungle?
- Mostly it's the bureaucratic jungle.

274
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,278
We purchase most of our exhibits
from animal dealers.

275
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:52,908
- How long have you worked at the zoo?
- Ten years.

276
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,118
No, 11 years.

277
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,205
But I've been into zoology
since I was a kid.

278
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:02,376
I prefer animals to people.
What about you?

279
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:07,172
I'm looking for a job.
My brother is supposed to help me.

280
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:12,094
If he ever gets back.
He's been gone for two days now.

281
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:13,804
How do you eat these?

282
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:19,518
Well... you take this wedge
of lemon, like this.

283
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,687
Squirt it on your oyster.

284
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,690
Then you hit it with
this horseradish red sauce.

285
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,651
Just a touch. Pick it up

286
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:31,196
and then let that sucker
slide down your throat.

287
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:37,161
What kind of job are you looking for?

288
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:42,291
Well, commercial art, mainly.
I've taken art lessons.

289
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,920
Then you chase it down real quick
with a swig of beer.

290
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,215
Or Coca-Cola.

291
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:02,394
Look, how would you like to
work at the zoo?

292
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:07,774
The zoo.

293
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:12,696
That would be fascinating but...
no, I'm not really qualified.

294
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:15,365
You're qualified to work in the gift shop.

295
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,911
If you're interested,
I could pull a few strings.

296
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:22,122
- You could?
- Sure.

297
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,458
I'll talk to the curator.

298
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,920
I'll be right back.

299
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:55,155
In the pool, girls.
Let's go, in the pool.

300
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,617
Let's go, hup, hup. Bath time.

301
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,118
Good morning.

302
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,954
- Morning.
- Alice.

303
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,082
I put the new tape in.
You wanna give it a listen?

304
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,750
Yeah.

305
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,838
- 'The canis lupus are... '
- Sounds terrific.

306
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,967
Old Tom's due for a worming.
Want me to handle that?

307
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,426
Yeah.

308
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,304
- Hey, Tom.
- Why are you so dressed up today?

309
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:22,015
- I have a meeting.
- Oh? Where?

310
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:25,561
- In my office.
- Oh.

311
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:28,188
- Hey, Angel.
-

312
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,860
Ah. The cheetah's
been a bit of a problem.

313
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,195
Been acting really weird.

314
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:36,864
- Diet?
- Yeah.

315
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:42,202
Light day, fast day,
five days regular. Keep it balanced.

316
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,413
- Muscle meat, viscera.
- Viscera.

317
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,167
- A few bones, vitamin supplements.
- I'll try that.

318
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:52,754
- How's the black leopard?
- Fine. A little extra protein never hurts.

319
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:56,466
- Oh, a little Rats-A-Roni.
- Yep.

320
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,260
Ratatouille?

321
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,680
Rat tartare?

322
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,292
Like I said, the pay ain't great.

323
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,337
No, I... I really like it.

324
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:39,343
- I like to be around the animals.
- Oh, yeah.

325
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:44,264
There's Ally the alligator, Bambi
and Oscar the orang-utan.

326
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,393
Every now and then,
you've got to feed these guys a pillow.

327
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,563
What?

328
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,733
Nothing.

329
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,494
Aquila.

330
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,293
Just plain horsemeat.

331
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:16,547
Pardon me.
You didn't have to kill it.

332
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,674
Hey, Mr Fabulous.

333
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,763
Here's one hungry guy.

334
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,100
Eat!

335
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:34,982
- 'God, I feel so helpless.'
- 'I know, Draper, let it out.'

336
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:44,324
'You don't know what it was
like, Sarah, finding her lying on the floor.

337
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:50,122
'I'm sorry. I told myself I'd stop
crying on your shoulder after that trial.'

338
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:53,083
- DJ.
- 'Lf I'd stopped for a beer... '

339
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,461
'But you didn't.
You must remember that.'

340
00:38:56,503 --> 00:39:02,050
- Pancho. Did they operate?
- 'I'll never forget those flames.

341
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:06,096
'And my Rosemary lying there
with my baby inside of her.'

342
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:11,602
- Come in!
- Come on, Tom, let's go!

343
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:15,397
- Brett, let's go.
- What's the matter? We'll be late.

344
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:19,359
We gotta go. Hurry up,
what's wrong with that thing?

345
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:22,696
Come on!

346
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:27,618
Take it easy. I thought you guys
were supposed to be courteous.

347
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:30,412
You have to hurt it or it won't respond.

348
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,499
Ooh, Empire Strikes Back gum.

349
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,878
25.
 Quarter. Thank you.

350
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,214
- Hi, I'm Alice.
- Irena.

351
00:39:40,255 --> 00:39:44,134
- You're Oliver's friend.
- We just met a few days ago.

352
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,678
- You're not from New Orleans?
- No.

353
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,724
Strange, isn't it?
People are crazy here. It's the humidity.

354
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:54,520
- Have you seen much of the city?
- No. I'd like to, though.

355
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:58,524
Let's have a drink after work.
We can work out an itinerary.

356
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,108
- OK.
- Fine.

357
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,528
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye.

358
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,446
Just hit it real hard.

359
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,449
- 
- There you go.

360
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,370
That colour suits you.
Where'd you get that?

361
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,580
Excuse me.

362
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:17,042
Where the hell did she come from?

363
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:19,920
Jesus. Don't encourage these assholes.

364
00:40:19,962 --> 00:40:23,465
- How do you not encourage them?
- I tell them I'm gay.

365
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:27,219
- What if they believe you?
- I should be so lucky.

366
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:30,389
If you want to get laid
you can do better than that.

367
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,226
He was just being friendly.
I was not trying to get laid.

368
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,645
Occasionally they're compatible.

369
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:40,232
- I wouldn't know.
- How come?

370
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:46,238
I never met anybody I liked
enough to have sex with.

371
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,617
- Never?
- Not so far, no.

372
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:53,579
Really? You're still a virgin?

373
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,625
Come on, don't make it sound
so perverse.

374
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:03,755
Not at all. Just incomprehensible,
maybe, especially these days.

375
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,632
Oh, it's...

376
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:09,011
You must have come close,
once or twice.

377
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:12,681
- Yeah, once or twice.
- How close?

378
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:15,267
Oh, come on.

379
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,687
The first parents I lived with,

380
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,273
the mother was OK but the father was a...

381
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,693
- A lech?
- He used to grab me.

382
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:27,196
- Overhand or underhand?
- Underhand.

383
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:30,574
- I know the type.
- There was this one boy...

384
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:34,495
- Mi hermana.
- What?

385
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:37,956
Mi hermana.

386
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,587
Friend of yours?

387
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:48,759
No, I never saw her before.
What did she say?

388
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,844
Mi hermana - my sister.

389
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:55,182
She was probably drunk.
So what happened?

390
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,061
- Erm, what? I don't remember.
- The boy you liked.

391
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:03,357
Oh, right.
So, we petted and stuff like that.

392
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:06,527
He wanted to go all the way
and so did I but...

393
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,448
- I got scared. He looked so...
- What?

394
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,702
- Huge.
- God, what's his name, quick?

395
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,914
I guess I'm a romantic at heart.

396
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:22,459
When it's right, it'll happen.
It'll be magical.

397
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,628
I'm not knocking it.

398
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,214
Here's to the magic.

399
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,616
It's the same with every bureaucracy.

400
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:58,495
You have things worked out
then they won't meet you halfway.

401
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,915
# What's new, pussycat? Whoa-ho-ho

402
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:06,253
# What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-ha-ho-ho-ho-ho

403
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:10,132
# Pussycat, pussycat, I love you

404
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:12,593
# Yes, I do

405
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:15,804
# You and your pussycat... smell #

406
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,517
Come on, fella,
I gotta clean out the bunker.

407
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,770
Clean it out,
it'll be real nice for you. Move it!

408
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:27,983
You're supposed to be in the back.
Back through the door, guy.

409
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:31,195
- Won't cooperate.
- He's afraid.

410
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,990
Come on, come on!

411
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:44,249
Hey, move, move it!

412
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,424
Come on, come on!

413
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,887
Careful, careful! Stay back.

414
00:43:56,929 --> 00:44:00,682
Hey, come on!
Would you back up, please?

415
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:05,270
- Go through the... Hey, Oliver!
- Yeah!

416
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:07,523
Bring the prod, he's going apeshit.

417
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,279
Simmer down!

418
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,455
Yeah, that's fine.

419
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:29,211
Hey! Come on!

420
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,088
Whoa! Ahh!

421
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:35,759
Oliver!

422
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,564
Oh, God! Oh, God!

423
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,608
Call the paramedics!
Call 'em, call 'em!

424
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,359
You shouldn't be doing this.

425
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,577
He was only 26 years old.

426
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:14,441
We better tell the police
the leopard's gone.

427
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,218
Female?

428
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:49,518
Female?

429
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:35,481
- Paul! Paul, where were you?
- In prison.

430
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:40,027
- In prison? What for?
- I was praying for the condemned.

431
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:48,410
Paul, oh, Paul, forgive me.
I saw somebody killed today.

432
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,621
Somebody I knew.

433
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,751
I didn't think you were ready
but you are.

434
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,295
I knew it when I saw you with him.

435
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,965
Who?

436
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:06,803
- Oliver?
- You want to fuck him, don't you?

437
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,766
You dream about fucking him,
your whole body burns.

438
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:15,187
It burns all along your nerves,
in your mouth, your breasts.

439
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:17,773
- You go wet between your legs.
- Stop it!

440
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:22,986
Every time it happens
you tell yourself that it's love,

441
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:24,947
but it isn't.

442
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:30,244
It's blood. Death.

443
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:33,038
You can't escape
the nightmare without me.

444
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,458
And I can't escape without you.

445
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:41,046
I've waited a long time for you.

446
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,968
Paul, don't you touch me!

447
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:50,389
But I'm the only one who can touch you
and only you can touch me.

448
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,475
We're safe together
because we're the same.

449
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,394
I'm not like you!

450
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:59,523
Oh, yes, you are.
You've always known it.

451
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:03,277
Do you remember,
when you were a child,

452
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:06,029
the animals used to call your name?

453
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:10,075
And you knew in the dark
when the others were dreaming

454
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,411
and you could never get to sleep.

455
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:17,291
- You're insane!
- No.

456
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,459
No, I'm not.

457
00:49:20,544 --> 00:49:23,088
I'm not in love.

458
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,050
What will you do?
Will you leap through his hoop?

459
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:31,513
Take his head in your mouth like an egg?

460
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:34,725
I need you.

461
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:39,313
- Who are you?
- I need you. I need you!

462
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:41,773
Don't. You're not my brother.

463
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,984
Oh!

464
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:47,571
Don't!

465
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:10,427
Stop!

466
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:16,099
What's wrong? Can I help you?

467
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:25,192
- You sure everything's OK?
- Honest.

468
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:29,571
I thought I was being chased,
it was just somebody out walking.

469
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,866
I'm sorry I got so excited.
I just got scared.

470
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,202
All right. I'll be glad to write it up.

471
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:38,956
No! No, no, thank you.

472
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:48,757
- Everything all right, Bill?
- Yeah, turned out to be nothing.

473
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,552
- 
- Good.

474
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:54,596
Quiet! Shut up, idiot!

475
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:57,724
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

476
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:01,562
Something strange.
He senses something.

477
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:04,565
We'd better look into it. Let me call it in.

478
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:09,987
I was sleeping, I didn't hear anything.

479
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:14,199
Are you sure? Hm?

480
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:17,578
What about the basement?

481
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:20,747
You don't know anything
about that, either?

482
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:24,209
Basement. Oh, I don't go there.

483
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:31,300
- What about the guys at the lab?
- They're on their way.

484
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:39,725
Miss Perrin, Dr Yates?
You're with the zoo, right?

485
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:43,270
- Yeah.
- I want to show you something.

486
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:50,152
At least we know now
where the leopard came from.

487
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,530
Follow me.

488
00:51:56,575 --> 00:52:00,162
What's that smell?
 I don't know.

489
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:04,750
The dog picked up
the scent real strong.

490
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,419
You should've seen him. He went crazy.

491
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:15,010
Look.
There's three or four bodies in there.

492
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:17,763
- Probably more buried around.
- Oh, God.

493
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,934
I expect Gallier killed them first,
possibly in some ritual,

494
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,936
then fed them to the leopard.

495
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,355
We've found others over the years.

496
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:30,484
Mostly prostitutes, runaways -
half-eaten, genitals torn out.

497
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,986
- Why?
- Who knows?

498
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:36,532
Gallier's been in and out of
psycho wards since he was 12.

499
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:39,409
He's a religious fanatic.

500
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:45,582
Where could he possibly
have found a cat like this?

501
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:48,669
And how could he have
handled it by himself?

502
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,798
He was raised around them,
at least until he was ten.

503
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,218
His folks were carnival people,
lion trainers.

504
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,264
- Till they blew their brains out.
- Is Irena involved?

505
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:05,394
What are you suggesting?
Irena only met her brother a week ago.

506
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,189
We have no reason to suspect her.

507
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:12,651
In fact, it looked as if
he planned to kill her too.

508
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:16,071
If I was her,
I'd find me another place to live.

509
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:21,201
I'll take care of that.

510
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,919
- Don't touch me.
- Watch it, lady.

511
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,307
OK, take her in.

512
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,445
It's an old MG.

513
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:42,199
I bought it two years ago,
I've been fixing it ever since.

514
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,327
Room's upstairs
if you want to lie down.

515
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:04,513
I've been using this room as a darkroom
so it might be a little cluttered.

516
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,368
I'm gonna grab a few hours' sleep.

517
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,122
We might be going out
to the country in the morning.

518
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:33,375
If you need anything,
I'll be right across the way.

519
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:37,087
He couldn't be my brother.

520
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:40,257
My brother
wouldn't have done those things.

521
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:42,217
No, I'm sure he wouldn't.

522
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:46,889
Well... good night.

523
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,935
Look at that boat.

524
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:46,156
Look at that crane.

525
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,246
Look at that boat!

526
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,093
This is a bayou plantation.

527
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:12,057
One day I'm gonna buy you
a plantation! Let's get the boat.

528
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,560
Either that or we have to swim.

529
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,603
- Open that?
- Pardon me?

530
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,856
Loosen up here?

531
00:57:50,846 --> 00:57:54,266
- Hey, Oliver.
- Hey, Yeatman.

532
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,065
Whoa.

533
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,359
I opened her up and aired her out.

534
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:08,447
- You old fish bait, how the hell are you?
- And you, redneck?

535
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:12,034
This is Irena. This is Yeatman Brewer.

536
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:15,829
She's mighty pretty.
Let me help you with your bags.

537
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,457
Yeatman helped me build this place.

538
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:21,418
He also helped me tear it apart
a few nights...

539
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,671
You draw this in real slow
and there's a crab on here.

540
00:58:24,713 --> 00:58:27,508
Then I draw him across.
Don't lift the net up.

541
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:30,761
Don't lift the net up. Now lift the net up.

542
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:33,388
You got two of them!

543
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:36,934
- All right, not bad.
- My God, look at them.

544
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:40,479
You take them
and you dump them in that basket.

545
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:44,024
Not... on me!

546
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:56,036
This one doesn't want to go out.

547
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,629
Billie, me and Ted are going back
to the hotel for a nap before dinner.

548
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,841
OK, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

549
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,969
Is there anything
you wouldn't do, Billie?

550
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:21,937
Look how dreary.

551
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,194
Hold it right there.

552
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,822
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

553
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:36,326
- May I take your picture?
- I'd love it.

554
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,622
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

555
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,223
Listen.

556
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,895
- What?
- Can't you hear it?

557
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,901
That's alligators. They're gonna eat us.

558
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,611
Alligators.

559
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:13,822
Only one way to keep them away,
you know what it is?

560
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:16,450
- No.
- You have to make love.

561
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:21,079
They hate the sound.

562
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,243
I can't.

563
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,671
Look, don't be upset, baby, it happens.

564
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:16,260
I like you, Billie.

565
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:20,055
That's no problem, hon. I like you, too.

566
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,516
You don't understand.

567
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,768
Sure I do.

568
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,063
You're just a little nervous, that's all.

569
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:32,317
I know how to take care of men like you.
You just need some time.

570
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:36,196
Every time I pray it won't happen again.

571
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,287
You've got very beautiful hair.

572
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,123
Thank you.

573
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:50,085
Relax. It's no big deal.

574
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,046
Momma'll make it better.

575
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:00,512
Oh, that's better.

576
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,724
That's much, much better.

577
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:05,234
Don't look at me!

578
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:23,789
Detective?

579
01:09:24,915 --> 01:09:28,252
- Looks like we got another murder.
- The leopard?

580
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:32,881
The girl came back late last night
with a man - early 30s, brown hair.

581
01:09:32,923 --> 01:09:35,717
We put the time of death at around three.

582
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,178
- Who was she?
- Who knows? A tourist?

583
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,390
Now get this,
he picked her up at a cemetery.

584
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:45,394
Can we look?

585
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:48,522
Hope you haven't had breakfast.
Come on.

586
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:10,627
Where are you going? Hey!
Where are you going?

587
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:13,172
- I'm leaving, I have to.
- What?

588
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:17,259
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Somewhere. I can't stay here!

589
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,386
Why? Why? Why?

590
01:10:20,512 --> 01:10:22,931
Why? Just say why. Why?

591
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:25,142
- Can't you see?
- What?

592
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:30,230
- I'm going crazy just like him.
- Who, Paul?

593
01:10:30,272 --> 01:10:33,775
Paul? He has nothing to do with you.

594
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:37,529
I don't even think he's your brother.

595
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:40,866
Listen, Irena.

596
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,951
I'm 34 years old.

597
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:49,708
I've spent my life looking for somebody
I even wanted to be in love with.

598
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,046
Now that I've found you
I'm not gonna let you go.

599
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:56,423
- I love you.
- Oh, yeah?

600
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:02,095
Would you love me just as much

601
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:05,015
if we could never sleep together?

602
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:09,561
- Don't be stupid.
- Yes?

603
01:11:11,688 --> 01:11:16,360
I love you and I wanna take care of you
and that's all that's important.

604
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:18,403
I'm afraid.

605
01:11:20,405 --> 01:11:22,950
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?

606
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:31,458
- I'm afraid for you.
- Irena, you don't understand.

607
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,337
I'm afraid so much.
 I'll always love you.

608
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:38,423
I loved you before you were born.

609
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,886
I don't know.

610
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:46,807
Come on.

611
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:20,549
The leopard's probably out of
the parish by now unless he's dead.

612
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:25,179
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- I don't think you're gonna see it.

613
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,434
- What do you mean?
- The Sheriff is gonna call it off.

614
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:34,313
We can't afford the manpower
or the time. It's been a week.

615
01:12:34,354 --> 01:12:39,109
- Are you out of your mind?
- They did everything they could.

616
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:42,362
- And when it kills again?
- Don't give me that shit.

617
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:46,450
You wouldn't shoot the bastard
when we had him in a cage.

618
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:51,079
- Sorry, I don't know why I did that.
- Yeah, well, fuck you.

619
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,167
- He's right.
- No, he's not.

620
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:59,087
- How the hell would you know, huh?
- What?

621
01:12:59,129 --> 01:13:01,507
- What?
- Nothing.

622
01:13:13,185 --> 01:13:15,729
- How's Irena feeling?
- Fine.

623
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:18,690
- You wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

624
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:21,527
- Jesus, what do you think?
- Irena will be OK.

625
01:13:21,568 --> 01:13:25,572
I don't even...
Irena's not the one I'm worried about.

626
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:29,034
- Her type will always be OK.
- What's that mean?

627
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:32,037
Look, I'm not blind, Oliver.

628
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:37,167
I've seen you obsessed before,
not like this.

629
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:40,838
I even thought I'd seen you
in love before - my vanity.

630
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:44,091
- Let's talk about something else.
- OK. All right.

631
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:46,468
I know what I'm doing.

632
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,309
Save me.

633
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,519
Only you can stop this killing.

634
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:39,688
You've got to make love with me.

635
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:42,983
As brother and sister.

636
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:49,198
I searched for you for so long,
from one foster home to another.

637
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:51,408
We can live together as mates.

638
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:55,954
Just as our parents did.

639
01:14:55,996 --> 01:15:00,709
You do know that they were
brother and sister, don't you?

640
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:02,711
- No.
- Oh, yes.

641
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:12,054
Make love with me and save both of us.

642
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:16,558
No.

643
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,062
I'm not like you.

644
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:23,607
That's the lie that will kill your lover.

645
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:26,568
At least let me spare you that horror.

646
01:15:36,537 --> 01:15:39,248
Come on, come on.

647
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,503
- Come and lie next to me.
- No.

648
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:55,305
Oliver doesn't love you,
he loves the panther.

649
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:57,850
He wants you because he fears you.

650
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:01,687
Let Alice have him.

651
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:05,357
She thinks his fear is courage

652
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:08,277
and he thinks his fear is love.

653
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,156
They were made for each other.

654
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:19,580
So were we.

655
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:29,673
- Take my hand.
- No.

656
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:46,106
Then you leave me with no choice.

657
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:02,998
Oh, Paul. I'll come with you, OK?

658
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,335
We'll go together, you and I, OK?

659
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,462
Lt'll be all right.

660
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:31,610
Ah!

661
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:15,445
I'm gonna make some coffee.

662
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,866
Sure. I'll get some towels.

663
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:39,636
Irena, I'm back.

664
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:43,390
Alice is here.
Why don't you join us for coffee?

665
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:49,313
Irena?

666
01:19:01,658 --> 01:19:05,245
Oliver!

667
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:27,935
Alice!

668
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:32,272
Oliver?!

669
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:35,067
Alice, get the gun! Get the shotgun!

670
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:00,082
Paul - he's dead?

671
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,462
Then you have no one.

672
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,758
Who am I?

673
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,969
- What am I?
- Shh.

674
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:14,555
Don't ask what you already know.

675
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:18,475
No, Female, I don't know, I...

676
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:20,727
I don't know where to go.

677
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:29,278
Live as he did - hidden, in chains.

678
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:32,823
Never love.

679
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,035
Pretend the world is what men think it is.

680
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:38,996
Wait.

681
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,957
Don't leave me like this.

682
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,752
I don't know where to go.

683
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,964
It doesn't matter where you go,

684
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:51,216

Please? I really need it tonight.

and porcupines together?

they could share.

- I'm sorry.

out of the porcupines.

- Brilliant.

- Got him?
- Yeah.

- Sure.

- Not right now. In a few minutes.
- OK. I'll see you at the house.
