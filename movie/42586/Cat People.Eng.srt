1
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:17,249
'Flight 85
now boarding at Gate 12B.

2
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:22,212
'Flight 85, final boarding call, 12B.'

3
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,214
Over to the right.

4
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:37,227
- Hi!
- Good to see you.

5
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:44,109
Hello. It's a beautiful day.
Would you contribute to the Lighthouse?

6
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:46,778
- Excuse me, sir, it's a...
- No, thanks.

7
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,575
Hello, would you care to
contribute to the Lighthouse?

8
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,119
Excuse me, sir, would you care to...

9
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,415
You're gonna get me?
I'll be outside by the taxis.

10
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:01,376
Right. Where you picked me up last time.

11
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,670
I'm Paul.

12
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,299
I'm Irena.

13
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,719
Yes, I know.

14
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:19,602
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

15
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:25,859
- How was your flight?
- Oh, I hate flying.

16
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,360
Oh!

17
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:30,321
- It scares me to death.
- It scares me too.

18
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,659
- You look really nice.
- Thank you.

19
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,786
Welcome to New Orleans.

20
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,581
I wanted to get here as fast as I could.

21
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:45,211
'Mr Al Curtis, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.'

22
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:47,088
We can get a taxi down there.

23
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,550
- Did you wait long?
- No, just a few minutes.

24
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:12,488
Ah, you're here at last! I'm so glad.

25
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:17,660
Oh, let me look at you.
Let me look at you.

26
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:23,582
Oh, your hair is so pretty!
Is that how they're doing the hair now?

27
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:27,086
- Female, this is my sister Irena.
- I can see that.

28
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:31,674
I'd know those Gallier eyes anywhere.
She's a lovely little thing.

29
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:34,593
He is driving me
crazy waiting for you.

30
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,720
Do I get the credit for that?

31
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:40,975
Female keeps me out of trouble.

32
00:08:41,016 --> 00:08:44,353
That's a full-time job.
You better believe it.

33
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:49,191
- Fem...?
- Female, like tamale. F-e-m-a-l-e.

34
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:52,569
See, I was orphaned too.
You like this house?

35
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:56,740
They didn't know what name
to put on the birth certificate,

36
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,784
so they put "child, female".

37
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:01,954
The woman that raised me,
God rest her soul,

38
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:06,792
she didn't read English too good,
so she pronounced it "Femolly".

39
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,087
So, here I am. "Fee-male", "Femolly",

40
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:13,006
"Femolly", "Fee-male..."

41
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:20,847
# Faraway places

42
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,350
# With strange sounding names... #

43
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:26,186
Fate wrenched us
apart as children.

44
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,647
Thy mercy restores us here today.

45
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,733
For this mending,
we thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.

46
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,236
- Amen.
- Amen.

47
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,368
- Mmm.
- Watch out, this is hot.

48
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:46,581
Oh! I forgot to call
the Robinsons. I'm sorry.

49
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:51,294
- Why do you have to call now?
- They care about me.

50
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,922
Sit down, you can call after dinner.

51
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:57,217
This is Female's special gumbo.

52
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,470
Special gumbo tonight
from yesterday's chicken.

53
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,222
That's right.

54
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:07,268
I didn't want them to worry.
They've been really nice, you'd like them.

55
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,606
Janice works at the nursery school,
she has three children.

56
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:16,361
And Arnold is from the CPA, you know?
He's extremely mellow.

57
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:20,573
The only time he only loses his temper
is around April 15th and...

58
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:24,494
Did they ever tell you
how our parents died?

59
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:27,038
Yes.

60
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:30,583
What did they tell you about me?

61
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:36,130
Well, not much.

62
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:39,467
I knew I had a brother
but I was only four.

63
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,889
I used to fantasize about you
when I was in the orphanage.

64
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,226
- Fantasize?
- You know...

65
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:52,480
about you coming to
rescue me and things.

66
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,440
Daydreams.

67
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:57,110
Yes, I had the same dreams.

68
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,614
I've got a surprise for you.

69
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:05,034
- Remember our practices together?
- For what?

70
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,161
For the circus.

71
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:11,457
Uh-uh, I said it was a surprise.

72
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,255
No peeking, huh? No peeking.

73
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:25,179
Ta-da!

74
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:29,642
God!

75
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:45,950
The skeletons are out
of the closet now, eh?

76
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:52,498
When Grandfather started the circus,
he only had one wagon.

77
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:55,334
Oh, it was a beautiful two-tiered one.

78
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:58,796
- There's a picture of it somewhere. Here.
- Oh, yeah!

79
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:01,799
The apes were kept on top
and the cat underneath.

80
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,678
The chimp teased the cat by throwing
garbage down through the bars.

81
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,231
God, they look so young.

82
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:20,150
Mother looks so happy.

83
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:23,529
I envy you. I wish I'd known them.

84
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:34,456
"Some little mice sat in the barn to spin

85
00:12:34,498 --> 00:12:36,875
"Pussy came by and popped her head in

86
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:39,503
"'What are you doing, my little men? '

87
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:44,257
- "'Weaving coats for gentlemen."'
- Very good!

88
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:47,385
"'Shall I come in
and cut your threads off?"'

89
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:52,432
"'Oh, no, kind sir,
we will snap our heads off."'

90
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,395
He's been waiting 45 minutes.

91
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:07,441
Fuck off! I had to get a baby-sitter.

92
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:10,152
Room three. Hurry up.

93
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:12,780
I'll take that.

94
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:17,201
"Baby-sitter". You're always late.

95
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,967
Sorry I'm late.

96
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,766
Hi, I'm Ruthie.

97
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:45,354
But you can call me anything you want
if the price is right.

98
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,481
A joke.

99
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:50,484
Doesn't cost anything extra to laugh.

100
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,988
Oh, I get it. Strong, silent type, huh?

101
00:15:56,114 --> 00:15:59,326
Uh, you know the rules around here?

102
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,077
Guess not. OK.

103
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:07,209
A massage alone is $25
and for $25 that's all you get.

104
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,212
Tipping is allowed and appreciated,

105
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:14,799
if you want to negotiate
for something extra?

106
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:20,138
We take Mastercharge, Visa,
American Express but not for tips.

107
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,898
OK, that's not really true,
you can put tips on Visa if you want.

108
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,859
Eww!

109
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,438
Somebody help me!

110
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:34,128
Dr Yates, New Orleans Zoo.
Bill Searle called about a stray cat?

111
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,672
What took you so long? Go on inside.

112
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:42,595
- It's in here?
- Right there.

113
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,602
Oliver, you won't believe this.

114
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:53,355
What it is,
it's a goddamn black leopard.

115
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:55,649
We don't know where it came from.

116
00:17:55,691 --> 00:17:58,485
It mauled a hooker last night.
She's OK.

117
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,197
We've got it trapped
in a room upstairs. Look at this.

118
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,994
- Candid Camera.
- Let's hear it for voyeurism.

119
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:09,872
- Strictly security.
- Where is he?

120
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,957
Back under the bed.

121
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:15,794
Scared the shit out of the john.
Guy split stark naked.

122
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,172
- Who'd notice here?
- How'd it get in?

123
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,924
- Fire escape?
- The window's got bars.

124
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,676
- Back door?
- Locked.

125
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:24,762
- The front.
- I'd have noticed.

126
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:29,892
- Wait. Look there.
- Holy shit!

127
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,103
- He's enormous.
- 125, 130 pounds.

128
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,441
More like 150.
He's big, all right, real big.

129
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:43,196
OK. Let's go with the ketamine.
2000 milligrams.

130
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:47,075
- Let's get him in the squeeze cage.
- Yeah, OK.

131
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,870
- Can we get to that window?
- Sure.

132
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,247
All right, let's go.

133
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,299
Bill?

134
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,427
With walkie-talkies
I can help from the monitor.

135
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:08,096
- Good idea.
- Can I borrow it? Thanks.

136
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:11,099
I shot the coyote in Baton Rouge.

137
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:12,642
- 2000 mg?
- Yeah.

138
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,729
- One ready if I miss? Full CO2 cartridge?
- Yeah.

139
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,939
- Got room?
- I'll make room.

140
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:21,401
- I'll hold the ladder.
- Hold the ladder.

141
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:30,035
- Be careless.
- You, too.

142
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:57,437
'Oliver, he knows you're there.'

143
00:19:57,478 --> 00:20:00,148
I hear him. He doesn't sound overjoyed.

144
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:07,155
- What are you doing?
- 'Cleaning the window.'

145
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:09,365
- What?
- 'Cleaning the... '

146
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:20,293
Jesus Christ, he's going
through the goddamn window!

147
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,490
Jesus.

148
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,164
Paul!

149
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,838
Paul?

150
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,481
- How is he?
- It's OK. Come on.

151
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:40,873
'We only have an hour.

152
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,917
'Lf only I hadn't let you
set that clock, Benny.

153
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,211
'You didn't set the alarm.'

154
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,130
- Good morning.
- Morning.

155
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:52,634
- Where's Paul?
- They needed him early at the mission.

156
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:56,346
Oh, he was going to show me the sights.

157
00:21:56,388 --> 00:22:00,267
Get yourself a guidebook -
they sell them all over town.

158
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:02,060
Go to the French Quarter,

159
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,605
have a good time
and don't worry about him.

160
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:08,358
Now, sit down.

161
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,944
Try some coffee.

162
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:14,364
I want to see if you like it with chicory.

163
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:16,950
Then I'll steam you some milk.

164
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:22,956
- You want some breakfast?
- No, thank you.

165
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:26,418
I'll fix you some breakfast, don't worry.

166
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:11,981
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Paul Gallier.

167
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:14,692
I don't believe he's in today.

168
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:18,028
Oh. I'm his sister.

169
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,742
Oh? Well, I can take you to his office
if you'd like to wait.

170
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:28,205
No, thank you. Thank you.

171
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:40,676
# Your soft lips... #
'Wear it out for Brett Ti Yo.'

172
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:43,554
# All your feelings, yeah... #

173
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:48,767
'Oh, and I tremble,
I tremble, I tremble.'

174
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:51,311
# Up under my... #

175
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:55,190
Wear it out, Pope.
Wear it out. Wear it out.

176
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,360
- What's that over there?
- That's the zoo.

177
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:00,195
Oh, wait, I want to go in.

178
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,656
What for? Nothing but a dump.

179
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:07,244
You want a zoo? Go to the Bronx.
I'll take you to the French Quarter.

180
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:09,913
I've seen that, now, please stop!

181
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:13,250
- It's your money.
- Keep the change.

182
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:36,481
All right, children, stay in line.

183
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:49,661
Come on!
Jimmy, leave your brother alone.

184
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:42,797
He's not so dangerous in a cage.

185
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:46,592
After testing,
we'll give this new leopard extra space.

186
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:49,387
- You'll have to disarm him.
- What's that?

187
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:53,015
Not much. Cut its claws, root canals.

188
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:55,643
Er, file and crown its fangs.

189
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:59,105
A dentist in town does it. Radenauer.

190
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:01,732
- Tom Radenauer?
- Yeah, he does people too.

191
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:06,112
I know, he's my dentist.
Shit, we don't have the funds for this.

192
00:27:06,153 --> 00:27:08,989
Aren't there any other alternatives?

193
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:11,909
Not really.
He's no good for breeding.

194
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:16,163
We tried trading it to another zoo
but they wouldn't take it.

195
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,041
- You could euthanize it.
- Kill it?

196
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:21,585
- Not acceptable.
- What would it cost?

197
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:23,337
- No.
- Can we discuss it?

198
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:27,841
I'll put up with no budget and no staff
and this place falling apart

199
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:30,219
but I will not put up with that crap!

200
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,097
Fine, calm down, I only asked.

201
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:39,770
We have a gourmet leopard.

202
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:42,731
He threw up,
Joe found pizza in the vomitus.

203
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:46,068
Yeah, I sure did. Ooh, pepperoni.

204
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:47,653
Leopards eat pizza?

205
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:51,615
He probably raided a garbage can
before the massage parlour.

206
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:55,077
- He didn't go there out of hunger.
- Maybe he was horny.

207
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:57,788
Always a possibility. Anything else?

208
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:02,459
Nothing, no worms, no distemper.
His owner takes good care of him.

209
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:04,670
Sure does. He's a superb cat.

210
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,298
A superb cat? He's a menace.

211
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:21,603
"'Not dreaming, noble lady

212
00:28:21,645 --> 00:28:26,233
"'Whence it is that I am taken

213
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:29,486

223
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,733
Hey!

224
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:52,902
Wait a minute!

225
00:30:10,836 --> 00:30:15,674
All right, do you wanna come on down?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

226
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:19,595
Watch out.

227
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,639
How'd you get up there?

228
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,686
- Here, let me help.
- I'm fine.

229
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:36,403
- What the hell were you doing?
- Sketching.

230
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:40,449
Sketching? That animal
shouldn't be out. Why did you run away?

231
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:43,744
- You scared me.
- But the leopard doesn't?

232
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:47,081
- You can sense how an animal feels.
- Oh, you can?

233
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:49,333
Sometimes we're all connected.

234
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,711
Who are you?

235
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:55,464
Irena Gallier. Who are you?

236
00:30:55,506 --> 00:31:00,093
I'm the curator here. The zoo's
been closed for an hour and a half.

237
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,771
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I feel dizzy.

238
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,195
You're burning up.
I'll get you something.

239
00:31:18,236 --> 00:31:20,655
- Oh, no.
- Come on, I don't bite.

240
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:35,086
Here, take these.

241
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:39,049
- I don't believe in medicine.
- It's aspirin.

242
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,218
No, thank you. I'm exhausted, that's all.

243
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:48,600
I flew in the day before yesterday,
went sightseeing, forgot to eat

244
00:31:49,684 --> 00:31:54,522
and when you started chasing me
I just got overexcited.

245
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:59,027
Yeah, well, I do sometimes
have that effect on women.

246
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,989
Oh, really?

247
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,993
No. That was a joke.

248
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:12,290
I don't wanna keep this on any more.

249
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,876
It's wetting up my hair. Thank you.

250
00:32:14,918 --> 00:32:17,962
It'll reduce the temperature.

251
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:20,548
No, it's down already.

252
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,135
Feel.

253
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:34,687
Just because it feels cooler
doesn't mean the temperature's gone.

254
00:32:34,729 --> 00:32:36,814
I'll go get a thermometer.

255
00:32:36,856 --> 00:32:40,860
Oh, come on, please.
I've always had a weird metabolism.

256
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,492
Really.

257
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,371
I just need some food and I'm all right.

258
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:55,666
You wanna have some dinner with me?

259
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:59,545
Yeah, sure, great. If you feel up to it.

260
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:04,050
I feel hungry.

261
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:06,594
I know a reasonably good steak place.

262
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:08,679
I don't eat meat.

263
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,266
- You're on a diet.
- They're not that fattening!

264
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:14,226
Oh, sure.

265
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:16,437
You don't look like a curator.

266
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:19,523
I look exactly like a curator.

267
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,859
No, you don't.

268
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:24,195
You haven't met many curators.

269
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:27,489
I guess not.
What does a curator do?

270
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,951
Different things.
Buys animals, sells animals,

271
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:34,038
veterinary work, research, exhibits.

272
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,250
Maybe an expedition if he lucks out
on a donation or a grant.

273
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:43,630
- Expedition? Like, into the jungle?
- Mostly it's the bureaucratic jungle.

274
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:48,260
We purchase most of our exhibits
from animal dealers.

275
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:52,890
- How long have you worked at the zoo?
- Ten years.

276
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,100
No, 11 years.

277
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:58,187
But I've been into zoology
since I was a kid.

278
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:02,357
I prefer animals to people.
What about you?

279
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,154
I'm looking for a job.
My brother is supposed to help me.

280
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:12,075
If he ever gets back.
He's been gone for two days now.

281
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,785
How do you eat these?

282
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:19,499
Well... you take this wedge
of lemon, like this.

283
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,668
Squirt it on your oyster.

284
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,671
Then you hit it with
this horseradish red sauce.

285
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:27,632
Just a touch. Pick it up

286
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:31,178
and then let that sucker
slide down your throat.

287
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:37,142
What kind of job are you looking for?

288
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,272
Well, commercial art, mainly.
I've taken art lessons.

289
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:46,902
Then you chase it down real quick
with a swig of beer.

290
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,196
Or Coca-Cola.

291
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:02,375
Look, how would you like to
work at the zoo?

292
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:07,756
The zoo.

293
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:12,677
That would be fascinating but...
no, I'm not really qualified.

294
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,346
You're qualified to work in the gift shop.

295
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:18,892
If you're interested,
I could pull a few strings.

296
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:22,103
- You could?
- Sure.

297
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:24,439
I'll talk to the curator.

298
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,900
I'll be right back.

299
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:55,136
In the pool, girls.
Let's go, in the pool.

300
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:58,598
Let's go, hup, hup. Bath time.

301
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,099
Good morning.

302
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,934
- Morning.
- Alice.

303
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:05,062
I put the new tape in.
You wanna give it a listen?

304
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:06,731
Yeah.

305
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:10,818
- 'The canis lupus are... '
- Sounds terrific.

306
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:14,947
Old Tom's due for a worming.
Want me to handle that?

307
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:16,407
Yeah.

308
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,285
- Hey, Tom.
- Why are you so dressed up today?

309
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,996
- I have a meeting.
- Oh? Where?

310
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:25,541
- In my office.
- Oh.

311
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,169
- Hey, Angel.
-

312
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,840
Ah. The cheetah's
been a bit of a problem.

313
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:35,175
Been acting really weird.

314
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:36,844
- Diet?
- Yeah.

315
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:42,182
Light day, fast day,
five days regular. Keep it balanced.

316
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,393
- Muscle meat, viscera.
- Viscera.

317
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,147
- A few bones, vitamin supplements.
- I'll try that.

318
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:52,735
- How's the black leopard?
- Fine. A little extra protein never hurts.

319
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:56,447
- Oh, a little Rats-A-Roni.
- Yep.

320
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:58,240
Ratatouille?

321
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:01,660
Rat tartare?

322
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,272
Like I said, the pay ain't great.

323
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:33,316
No, I... I really like it.

324
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:39,322
- I like to be around the animals.
- Oh, yeah.

325
00:37:39,364 --> 00:37:44,244
There's Ally the alligator, Bambi
and Oscar the orang-utan.

326
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:48,373
Every now and then,
you've got to feed these guys a pillow.

327
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,543
What?

328
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:54,713
Nothing.

329
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,473
Aquila.

330
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:13,273
Just plain horsemeat.

331
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,526
Pardon me.
You didn't have to kill it.

332
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:18,653
Hey, Mr Fabulous.

333
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,742
Here's one hungry guy.

334
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:28,079
Eat!

335
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:34,961
- 'God, I feel so helpless.'
- 'I know, Draper, let it out.'

336
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,303
'You don't know what it was
like, Sarah, finding her lying on the floor.

337
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:50,101
'I'm sorry. I told myself I'd stop
crying on your shoulder after that trial.'

338
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:53,062
- DJ.
- 'Lf I'd stopped for a beer... '

339
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:56,440
'But you didn't.
You must remember that.'

340
00:38:56,482 --> 00:39:02,029
- Pancho. Did they operate?
- 'I'll never forget those flames.

341
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:06,075
'And my Rosemary lying there
with my baby inside of her.'

342
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:11,580
- Come in!
- Come on, Tom, let's go!

343
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:15,376
- Brett, let's go.
- What's the matter? We'll be late.

344
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:19,338
We gotta go. Hurry up,
what's wrong with that thing?

345
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,675
Come on!

346
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:27,596
Take it easy. I thought you guys
were supposed to be courteous.

347
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:30,391
You have to hurt it or it won't respond.

348
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,477
Ooh, Empire Strikes Back gum.

349
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:37,857
25.
Quarter. Thank you.

350
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:40,192
- Hi, I'm Alice.
- Irena.

351
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:44,113
- You're Oliver's friend.
- We just met a few days ago.

352
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:46,657
- You're not from New Orleans?
- No.

353
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:50,703
Strange, isn't it?
People are crazy here. It's the humidity.

354
00:39:50,744 --> 00:39:54,498
- Have you seen much of the city?
- No. I'd like to, though.

355
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,502
Let's have a drink after work.
We can work out an itinerary.

356
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:00,087
- OK.
- Fine.

357
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,506
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye.

358
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:04,425
Just hit it real hard.

359
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,427
-
- There you go.

360
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:11,348
That colour suits you.
Where'd you get that?

361
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,559
Excuse me.

362
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,020
Where the hell did she come from?

363
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,898
Jesus. Don't encourage these assholes.

364
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,443
- How do you not encourage them?
- I tell them I'm gay.

365
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:27,197
- What if they believe you?
- I should be so lucky.

366
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,367
If you want to get laid
you can do better than that.

367
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:34,204
He was just being friendly.
I was not trying to get laid.

368
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:36,623
Occasionally they're compatible.

369
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:40,210
- I wouldn't know.
- How come?

370
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:46,216
I never met anybody I liked
enough to have sex with.

371
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:50,595
- Never?
- Not so far, no.

372
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:53,557
Really? You're still a virgin?

373
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,603
Come on, don't make it sound
so perverse.

374
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:03,733
Not at all. Just incomprehensible,
maybe, especially these days.

375
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:05,610
Oh, it's...

376
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:08,988
You must have come close,
once or twice.

377
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,659
- Yeah, once or twice.
- How close?

378
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:15,245
Oh, come on.

379
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:18,665
The first parents I lived with,

380
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:21,251
the mother was OK but the father was a...

381
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,671
- A lech?
- He used to grab me.

382
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,173
- Overhand or underhand?
- Underhand.

383
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:30,552
- I know the type.
- There was this one boy...

384
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:34,472
- Mi hermana.
- What?

385
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,934
Mi hermana.

386
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,564
Friend of yours?

387
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:48,736
No, I never saw her before.
What did she say?

388
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:50,822
Mi hermana - my sister.

389
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:55,159
She was probably drunk.
So what happened?

390
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:59,038
- Erm, what? I don't remember.
- The boy you liked.

391
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,334
Oh, right.
So, we petted and stuff like that.

392
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:06,504
He wanted to go all the way
and so did I but...

393
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:11,425
- I got scared. He looked so...
- What?

394
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:15,680
- Huge.
- God, what's his name, quick?

395
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:18,891
I guess I'm a romantic at heart.

396
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:22,436
When it's right, it'll happen.
It'll be magical.

397
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:24,605
I'm not knocking it.

398
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,191
Here's to the magic.

399
00:42:52,091 --> 00:42:54,593
It's the same with every bureaucracy.

400
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:58,472
You have things worked out
then they won't meet you halfway.

401
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:01,892
# What's new, pussycat? Whoa-ho-ho

402
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:06,230
# What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-ha-ho-ho-ho-ho

403
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:10,109
# Pussycat, pussycat, I love you

404
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,569
# Yes, I do

405
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:15,781
# You and your pussycat... smell #

406
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:20,494
Come on, fella,
I gotta clean out the bunker.

407
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:23,747
Clean it out,
it'll be real nice for you. Move it!

408
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:27,960
You're supposed to be in the back.
Back through the door, guy.

409
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:31,171
- Won't cooperate.
- He's afraid.

410
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:34,967
Come on, come on!

411
00:43:41,223 --> 00:43:44,226
Hey, move, move it!

412
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:52,400
Come on, come on!

413
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:56,863
Careful, careful! Stay back.

414
00:43:56,905 --> 00:44:00,659
Hey, come on!
Would you back up, please?

415
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,247
- Go through the... Hey, Oliver!
- Yeah!

416
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:07,499
Bring the prod, he's going apeshit.

417
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,255
Simmer down!

418
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:23,431
Yeah, that's fine.

419
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:29,187
Hey! Come on!

420
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,064
Whoa! Ahh!

421
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:35,735
Oliver!

422
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:48,539
Oh, God! Oh, God!

423
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:51,584
Call the paramedics!
Call 'em, call 'em!

424
00:45:31,874 --> 00:45:34,335
You shouldn't be doing this.

425
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,552
He was only 26 years old.

426
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:14,416
We better tell the police
the leopard's gone.

427
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:41,193
Female?

428
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,493
Female?

429
00:47:30,575 --> 00:47:35,455
- Paul! Paul, where were you?
- In prison.

430
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:40,001
- In prison? What for?
- I was praying for the condemned.

431
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:48,384
Paul, oh, Paul, forgive me.
I saw somebody killed today.

432
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:50,595
Somebody I knew.

433
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:55,725
I didn't think you were ready
but you are.

434
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:58,269
I knew it when I saw you with him.

435
00:47:59,854 --> 00:48:01,939
Who?

436
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:06,778
- Oliver?
- You want to fuck him, don't you?

437
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:10,740
You dream about fucking him,
your whole body burns.

438
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:15,161
It burns all along your nerves,
in your mouth, your breasts.

439
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:17,747
- You go wet between your legs.
- Stop it!

440
00:48:17,788 --> 00:48:22,960
Every time it happens
you tell yourself that it's love,

441
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:24,921
but it isn't.

442
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:30,217
It's blood. Death.

443
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:33,012
You can't escape
the nightmare without me.

444
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:36,432
And I can't escape without you.

445
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:41,020
I've waited a long time for you.

446
00:48:43,773 --> 00:48:45,941
Paul, don't you touch me!

447
00:48:45,983 --> 00:48:50,362
But I'm the only one who can touch you
and only you can touch me.

448
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:53,449
We're safe together
because we're the same.

449
00:48:53,491 --> 00:48:55,367
I'm not like you!

450
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:59,496
Oh, yes, you are.
You've always known it.

451
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:03,250
Do you remember,
when you were a child,

452
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:06,003
the animals used to call your name?

453
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:10,049
And you knew in the dark
when the others were dreaming

454
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,384
and you could never get to sleep.

455
00:49:13,844 --> 00:49:17,264
- You're insane!
- No.

456
00:49:17,306 --> 00:49:19,433
No, I'm not.

457
00:49:20,517 --> 00:49:23,061
I'm not in love.

458
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:27,024
What will you do?
Will you leap through his hoop?

459
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:31,486
Take his head in your mouth like an egg?

460
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:34,698
I need you.

461
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:39,286
- Who are you?
- I need you. I need you!

462
00:49:39,328 --> 00:49:41,747
Don't. You're not my brother.

463
00:49:41,788 --> 00:49:43,957
Oh!

464
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,544
Don't!

465
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,400
Stop!

466
00:50:12,861 --> 00:50:16,072
What's wrong? Can I help you?

467
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:25,165
- You sure everything's OK?
- Honest.

468
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:29,544
I thought I was being chased,
it was just somebody out walking.

469
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:32,839
I'm sorry I got so excited.
I just got scared.

470
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:35,175
All right. I'll be glad to write it up.

471
00:50:35,216 --> 00:50:38,928
No! No, no, thank you.

472
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:48,730
- Everything all right, Bill?
- Yeah, turned out to be nothing.

473
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,524
-
- Good.

474
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:54,569
Quiet! Shut up, idiot!

475
00:50:54,611 --> 00:50:57,697
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

476
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:01,534
Something strange.
He senses something.

477
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:04,537
We'd better look into it. Let me call it in.

478
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:09,959
I was sleeping, I didn't hear anything.

479
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:14,172
Are you sure? Hm?

480
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,550
What about the basement?

481
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:20,720
You don't know anything
about that, either?

482
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:24,182
Basement. Oh, I don't go there.

483
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:31,272
- What about the guys at the lab?
- They're on their way.

484
00:51:35,276 --> 00:51:39,697
Miss Perrin, Dr Yates?
You're with the zoo, right?

485
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:43,242
- Yeah.
- I want to show you something.

486
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:50,124
At least we know now
where the leopard came from.

487
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,502
Follow me.

488
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:00,134
What's that smell?
I don't know.

489
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,722
The dog picked up
the scent real strong.

490
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:07,391
You should've seen him. He went crazy.

491
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:14,982
Look.
There's three or four bodies in there.

492
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:17,735
- Probably more buried around.
- Oh, God.

493
00:52:17,776 --> 00:52:21,905
I expect Gallier killed them first,
possibly in some ritual,

494
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:23,907
then fed them to the leopard.

495
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:26,326
We've found others over the years.

496
00:52:26,368 --> 00:52:30,456
Mostly prostitutes, runaways -
half-eaten, genitals torn out.

497
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,958
- Why?
- Who knows?

498
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,503
Gallier's been in and out of
psycho wards since he was 12.

499
00:52:36,545 --> 00:52:39,381
He's a religious fanatic.

500
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,554
Where could he possibly
have found a cat like this?

501
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:48,640
And how could he have
handled it by himself?

502
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:52,769
He was raised around them,
at least until he was ten.

503
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:56,189
His folks were carnival people,
lion trainers.

504
00:52:56,231 --> 00:53:00,235
- Till they blew their brains out.
- Is Irena involved?

505
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:05,365
What are you suggesting?
Irena only met her brother a week ago.

506
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,161
We have no reason to suspect her.

507
00:53:09,202 --> 00:53:12,622
In fact, it looked as if
he planned to kill her too.

508
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:16,042
If I was her,
I'd find me another place to live.

509
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,172
I'll take care of that.

510
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,890
- Don't touch me.
- Watch it, lady.

511
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:43,278
OK, take her in.

512
00:54:36,372 --> 00:54:38,416
It's an old MG.

513
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:42,169
I bought it two years ago,
I've been fixing it ever since.

514
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:45,297
Room's upstairs
if you want to lie down.

515
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:04,483
I've been using this room as a darkroom
so it might be a little cluttered.

516
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,338
I'm gonna grab a few hours' sleep.

517
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,092
We might be going out
to the country in the morning.

518
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:33,345
If you need anything,
I'll be right across the way.

519
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:37,057
He couldn't be my brother.

520
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:40,227
My brother
wouldn't have done those things.

521
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:42,187
No, I'm sure he wouldn't.

522
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:46,858
Well... good night.

523
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:32,904
Look at that boat.

524
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,126
Look at that crane.

525
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,215
Look at that boat!

526
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:06,062
This is a bayou plantation.

527
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:12,026
One day I'm gonna buy you
a plantation! Let's get the boat.

528
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:14,529
Either that or we have to swim.

529
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,572
- Open that?
- Pardon me?

530
00:57:16,614 --> 00:57:18,825
Loosen up here?

531
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:54,235
- Hey, Oliver.
- Hey, Yeatman.

532
00:57:58,614 --> 00:58:02,034
Whoa.

533
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:04,328
I opened her up and aired her out.

534
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,415
- You old fish bait, how the hell are you?
- And you, redneck?

535
00:58:08,457 --> 00:58:12,002
This is Irena. This is Yeatman Brewer.

536
00:58:12,044 --> 00:58:15,798
She's mighty pretty.
Let me help you with your bags.

537
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,425
Yeatman helped me build this place.

538
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:21,387
He also helped me tear it apart
a few nights...

539
00:58:21,428 --> 00:58:24,640
You draw this in real slow
and there's a crab on here.

540
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:27,476
Then I draw him across.
Don't lift the net up.

541
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:30,729
Don't lift the net up. Now lift the net up.

542
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:33,357
You got two of them!

543
00:58:33,399 --> 00:58:36,902
- All right, not bad.
- My God, look at them.

544
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:40,447
You take them
and you dump them in that basket.

545
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:43,992
Not... on me!

546
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:56,004
This one doesn't want to go out.

547
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:05,597
Billie, me and Ted are going back
to the hotel for a nap before dinner.

548
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:08,809
OK, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

549
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,937
Is there anything
you wouldn't do, Billie?

550
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:21,905
Look how dreary.

551
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:29,162
Hold it right there.

552
00:59:29,204 --> 00:59:31,790
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

553
00:59:31,831 --> 00:59:36,294
- May I take your picture?
- I'd love it.

554
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:40,590
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

555
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:58,191
Listen.

556
01:00:00,151 --> 01:00:02,862
- What?
- Can't you hear it?

557
01:00:05,573 --> 01:00:08,868
That's alligators. They're gonna eat us.

558
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,578
Alligators.

559
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,790
Only one way to keep them away,
you know what it is?

560
01:00:13,831 --> 01:00:16,417
- No.
- You have to make love.

561
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:21,047
They hate the sound.

562
01:00:56,874 --> 01:00:59,210
I can't.

563
01:01:07,009 --> 01:01:10,638
Look, don't be upset, baby, it happens.

564
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:16,227
I like you, Billie.

565
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:20,022
That's no problem, hon. I like you, too.

566
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:22,483
You don't understand.

567
01:01:22,524 --> 01:01:24,735
Sure I do.

568
01:01:24,777 --> 01:01:28,030
You're just a little nervous, that's all.

569
01:01:28,072 --> 01:01:32,284
I know how to take care of men like you.
You just need some time.

570
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:36,163
Every time I pray it won't happen again.

571
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:43,253
You've got very beautiful hair.

572
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:46,089
Thank you.

573
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:50,052
Relax. It's no big deal.

574
01:01:51,136 --> 01:01:53,013
Momma'll make it better.

575
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,479
Oh, that's better.

576
01:02:01,438 --> 01:02:03,690
That's much, much better.

577
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:05,197
Don't look at me!

578
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,751
Detective?

579
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:28,214
- Looks like we got another murder.
- The leopard?

580
01:09:28,256 --> 01:09:32,844
The girl came back late last night
with a man - early 30s, brown hair.

581
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:35,680
We put the time of death at around three.

582
01:09:35,722 --> 01:09:38,141
- Who was she?
- Who knows? A tourist?

583
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:41,352
Now get this,
he picked her up at a cemetery.

584
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:45,356
Can we look?

585
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:48,484
Hope you haven't had breakfast.
Come on.

586
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:10,589
Where are you going? Hey!
Where are you going?

587
01:10:10,631 --> 01:10:13,134
- I'm leaving, I have to.
- What?

588
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:17,221
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Somewhere. I can't stay here!

589
01:10:17,263 --> 01:10:19,348
Why? Why? Why?

590
01:10:20,474 --> 01:10:22,893
Why? Just say why. Why?

591
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:25,104
- Can't you see?
- What?

592
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:30,192
- I'm going crazy just like him.
- Who, Paul?

593
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:33,737
Paul? He has nothing to do with you.

594
01:10:34,905 --> 01:10:37,491
I don't even think he's your brother.

595
01:10:38,784 --> 01:10:40,828
Listen, Irena.

596
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:42,913
I'm 34 years old.

597
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:49,670
I've spent my life looking for somebody
I even wanted to be in love with.

598
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:54,008
Now that I've found you
I'm not gonna let you go.

599
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:56,385
- I love you.
- Oh, yeah?

600
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:02,057
Would you love me just as much

601
01:11:02,099 --> 01:11:04,977
if we could never sleep together?

602
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:09,523
- Don't be stupid.
- Yes?

603
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:16,321
I love you and I wanna take care of you
and that's all that's important.

604
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:18,365
I'm afraid.

605
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:22,911
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?

606
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:31,420
- I'm afraid for you.
- Irena, you don't understand.

607
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:35,298
I'm afraid so much.
I'll always love you.

608
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,385
I loved you before you were born.

609
01:11:40,804 --> 01:11:42,848
I don't know.

610
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:46,768
Come on.

611
01:12:15,505 --> 01:12:20,510
The leopard's probably out of
the parish by now unless he's dead.

612
01:12:20,552 --> 01:12:25,139
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- I don't think you're gonna see it.

613
01:12:25,181 --> 01:12:30,395
- What do you mean?
- The Sheriff is gonna call it off.

614
01:12:30,436 --> 01:12:34,274
We can't afford the manpower
or the time. It's been a week.

615
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:39,070
- Are you out of your mind?
- They did everything they could.

616
01:12:39,112 --> 01:12:42,323
- And when it kills again?
- Don't give me that shit.

617
01:12:42,365 --> 01:12:46,411
You wouldn't shoot the bastard
when we had him in a cage.

618
01:12:46,452 --> 01:12:51,040
- Sorry, I don't know why I did that.
- Yeah, well, fuck you.

619
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:55,128
- He's right.
- No, he's not.

620
01:12:55,169 --> 01:12:59,048
- How the hell would you know, huh?
- What?

621
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:01,467
- What?
- Nothing.

622
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:15,690
- How's Irena feeling?
- Fine.

623
01:13:15,731 --> 01:13:18,651
- You wanna talk about it?
- Talk about what?

624
01:13:18,693 --> 01:13:21,487
- Jesus, what do you think?
- Irena will be OK.

625
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:25,533
I don't even...
Irena's not the one I'm worried about.

626
01:13:25,574 --> 01:13:28,994
- Her type will always be OK.
- What's that mean?

627
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:31,997
Look, I'm not blind, Oliver.

628
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:37,127
I've seen you obsessed before,
not like this.

629
01:13:37,169 --> 01:13:40,798
I even thought I'd seen you
in love before - my vanity.

630
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,051
- Let's talk about something else.
- OK. All right.

631
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:46,428
I know what I'm doing.

632
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,268
Save me.

633
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:37,479
Only you can stop this killing.

634
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:39,648
You've got to make love with me.

635
01:14:40,732 --> 01:14:42,943
As brother and sister.

636
01:14:44,444 --> 01:14:49,157
I searched for you for so long,
from one foster home to another.

637
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,368
We can live together as mates.

638
01:14:52,702 --> 01:14:55,914
Just as our parents did.

639
01:14:55,956 --> 01:15:00,669
You do know that they were
brother and sister, don't you?

640
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,671
- No.
- Oh, yes.

641
01:15:08,134 --> 01:15:12,013
Make love with me and save both of us.

642
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:16,518
No.

643
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:20,021
I'm not like you.

644
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:23,566
That's the lie that will kill your lover.

645
01:15:23,608 --> 01:15:26,528
At least let me spare you that horror.

646
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:39,207
Come on, come on.

647
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,462
- Come and lie next to me.
- No.

648
01:15:51,552 --> 01:15:55,264
Oliver doesn't love you,
he loves the panther.

649
01:15:55,306 --> 01:15:57,809
He wants you because he fears you.

650
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,646
Let Alice have him.

651
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:05,316
She thinks his fear is courage

652
01:16:05,358 --> 01:16:08,236
and he thinks his fear is love.

653
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,114
They were made for each other.

654
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:19,538
So were we.

655
01:16:26,671 --> 01:16:29,632
- Take my hand.
- No.

656
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,065
Then you leave me with no choice.

657
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:02,956
Oh, Paul. I'll come with you, OK?

658
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:06,293
We'll go together, you and I, OK?

659
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,420
Lt'll be all right.

660
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:31,568
Ah!

661
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:15,403
I'm gonna make some coffee.

662
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,823
Sure. I'll get some towels.

663
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,594
Irena, I'm back.

664
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:43,348
Alice is here.
Why don't you join us for coffee?

665
01:18:47,185 --> 01:18:49,270
Irena?

666
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:05,203
Oliver!

667
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:27,892
Alice!

668
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:32,229
Oliver?!

669
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:35,024
Alice, get the gun! Get the shotgun!

670
01:23:56,283 --> 01:24:00,036
Paul - he's dead?

671
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:05,417
Then you have no one.

672
01:24:07,461 --> 01:24:09,713
Who am I?

673
01:24:09,754 --> 01:24:11,923
- What am I?
- Shh.

674
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:14,509
Don't ask what you already know.

675
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:18,430
No, Female, I don't know, I...

676
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:20,682
I don't know where to go.

677
01:24:24,436 --> 01:24:29,232
Live as he did - hidden, in chains.

678
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:32,777
Never love.

679
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:36,990
Pretend the world is what men think it is.

680
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,950
Wait.

681
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:41,911
Don't leave me like this.

682
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:45,707
I don't know where to go.

683
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,918
It doesn't matter where you go,

684
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,170

Please? I really need it tonight.

bald porcupines out there.

and porcupines together?

they could share.

- I'm sorry.

out of the porcupines.

- Brilliant.

- Got him?
- Yeah.

- Sure.

Wanna have some lunch?

- Not right now. In a few minutes.
- OK. I'll see you at the house.
