1
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.000
I found a van for you.
When do you want it?

2
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
- When are you getting the blood?
- I can't get that much blood in one day.

3
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.360
- You're getting it in batches?
- Yeah...

4
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.480
- About a thousand litres.
- That's a lot, yeah?

5
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.840
- We do it at my place or here?
- I can get people to my home

6
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.080
and we can work there,
even through the night.

7
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.360
You'll get paid tomorrow.

8
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.120
You know everyone was asking
what are the containers for.

9
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.920
And we said they're
meant for honey.

10
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.720
Let's fill these ones.

11
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.480
- How many are they?
- Enough.

12
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.280
We've got a thousand litres of blood.

13
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.720
What is that?

14
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
It's okay. I don't want to know.

15
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.040
Naila! Come, come, come.

16
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.680
I'll leave you guys
to your party.

17
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.800
Let's go.

18
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.800
This is actually
the first part.

19
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.360
The World Bank
says Kenya is growing faster

20
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.000
than any other Sub-Saharan
African nation.

21
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.720
But there is one major impediment
to the country's continued growth.

22
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.240
Kenya has been run dismally

23
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.800
as one of the most corrupt
countries in the world.

24
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.960
We've found some pigs.

25
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.320
We can go pick them up.

26
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.600
We still have time.

27
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.120
Did you guys bring the paint?

28
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.320
MP!

29
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.200
The MP is looking for its salary.
Don't disturb it!

30
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.960
Now you see how you're going
to paint that guy! He's running away.

31
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.640
The rumour is that we'll show up
with caskets and dead people.

32
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.520
We've really confused them!

33
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.840
Parliament is not for profit!
It belongs to the people!

34
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.360
Parliament is not for profit!
It belongs to the people!

35
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.800
This is a gift for
the Members of Parliament!

36
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.120
Take your gifts MPs!

37
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.360
Stop chasing the Member of Parliament!

38
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.320
Get the hell out of here!

39
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.440
We want peace!

40
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.400
Stop beating him!

41
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.880
We want peace!

42
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.480
Why are you beating us?

43
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.880
Stop the oppression!
We are taxpayers!

44
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.200
Gentlemen.

45
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.280
This conference is of
crucial importance

46
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.400
to the future of Kenya.

47
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.800
Upon the degree of our
success or failure,

48
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.280
will depend the well-being,

49
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.920
the livelihood, and perhaps even
the physical safety

50
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.800
of all the citizens of Kenya

51
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.480
of whatever race or creed.

52
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.080
Kenya's vice president

53
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.000
has denied orchestrating post-election
violence since 2007

54
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.880
that left more than a thousand dead

55
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.240
and 500,000 homeless.

56
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.040
Drama that erupted.
The police lobbed tear gas canisters

57
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.960
at a group aged between
six to fourteen years.

58
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.640
Despite what happened here today,

59
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.640
the organizers of this movement
are vowing to fight on.

60
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.360
They say this is a battle that goes
to the very heart of democracy in Kenya.

61
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.120
No, Nate, Nate, Nate, share.

62
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.040
Please share.

63
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.560
No, no, no, no.

64
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.520
Just give it to him.
You're the big brother.

65
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.160
You're watching TV, you're playing.

66
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.600
Good job.

67
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.200
Our protest has been banned.

68
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.000
Yeah by the government. They say
we're planning to topple the government

69
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.880
and that we're funded by USAID.

70
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.320
We need to go. Freedom Corner
is actually an open place for anyone to go.

71
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.280
So what do we do?
So we go.

72
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.960
There will be violence today.

73
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.600
I don't know how. Help me.

74
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.440
Yeah.

75
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.320
Yeah.

76
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.000
Go get that spoon now.

77
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.560
It's good for us to get arrested so the people
can know this government is intolerant.

78
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.000
I tell people, President Uhuru
is not a tolerant person

79
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.000
and they don't believe me.

80
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.840
Guys, man, let's do this.

81
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.320
- So you'll go with Mummy.
- Where are you going?

82
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.920
I'm going to topple the government.

83
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.000
Get off the bike, sweetie.

84
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.280
Daddy, I want to go with you.

85
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.840
You can't go with me because

86
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.720
I'm going to a very dangerous place.

87
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.640
And welcome to Capital Talk.

88
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.240
The program we hope will have
an impact on the future of Kenya.

89
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.320
My guest today is a
rebel with a cause.

90
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.400
Twice CNN Photographer of
the Year, Boniface Mwangi.

91
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.040
Folks, this young man
is one word: fearless.

92
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960
I'd always wanted
to cover war.

93
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.200
As a news photographer, I wanted
to cover action, violence.

94
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.880
Kill him!

95
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.320
2007 was a life-changing
year for me.

96
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.480
Immediately after they
announced the elections,

97
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.320
there was burning and violence.

98
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.320
My very first photo

99
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.840
was a man coming home from work.

100
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.480
Some people stopped him and asked him,
"What tribe are you?"

101
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.960
When he said he's Luo,
they cut him with machetes.

102
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.440
They just messed him up.

103
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.400
He showed his ID saying,
"I am a Kenyan."

104
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.200
And the police looked at him, they did
not do anything because of his tribe.

105
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.640
I could go, take pictures

106
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.240
in the slums of Mathare, Kibera,

107
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.400
then come back to the
newsroom in the city center

108
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.400
and guys are having coffee
like everything is normal.

109
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
Every day I covered violence.
Every day I filed my pictures.

110
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.680
Every day they decided not to publish
my photos because they were too violent.

111
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.800
And every day I got more pissed
and more pissed.

112
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.600
The violence ended on February 28th

113
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.880
and about seven to eight
months later, I quit my job.

114
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.640
I can't stand politicians.
I can't stand the hypocrisy.

115
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.400
I thought, something was amiss.

116
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.200
Please, let's keep walking
so that others have a chance to look.

117
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.840
You can see his head hanging.

118
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.720
I have never seen such things.

119
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.520
Was it like this?

120
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.320
The head being beaten
until it falls down.

121
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.560
This is so bad.

122
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.160
These people need
to be arrested.

123
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
All those who did this.

124
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.600
Look at this.

125
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.880
He was just left hanging.

126
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.920
And people are just
walking by without caring.

127
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.880
Whom do they want to lead?
If they want to make us kill each other.

128
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.640
They want to lead fools.

129
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.160
They eat together while
we are here fighting.

130
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.760
We kill our friends while they
eat together peacefully.

131
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.160
Their kids are in good
schools studying.

132
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.640
While we stay in poverty.

133
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.320
Let's burn these!

134
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.680
Burn them!

135
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.560
The country is ours!

136
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.360
Politicians lied to us.
That's why there was violence.

137
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.800
Open your eyes! It's young
people who were affected.

138
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.920
You are being misled.

139
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.880
Can't you see?

140
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.720
I want to show that
you've been blinded.

141
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.440
I knew... he was going
to be very outspoken about issues

142
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.200
and he wants things to change.
That's the guy I met.

143
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.040
And probably that's the guy
I fell in love with

144
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.040
because he was very ambitious
in the sense that

145
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.160
he saw a different Kenya
in five, ten years to come.

146
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.760
Like things could change
and they needed to change.

147
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.320
You may kiss your wife.

148
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.920
They signed the Peace Treaty
on a week before our wedding.

149
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.400
And he broke down at our wedding.

150
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.720
Now when I think about it,
maybe it had something to do with it.

151
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.840
That he has actually lived
to that moment

152
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.200
to see himself getting
married and he's with a child.

153
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.040
- Look at Daddy!
- Hi Nate!

154
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.720
These are the embarrassing pictures

155
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.560
that children are shown when
they are a little older.

156
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.400
When I look to write
my list of achievements,

157
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.160
they're not the kind that
you can write on paper.

158
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.040
They're very family centered

159
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.040
and that's my
greatest achievement.

160
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.960
That day remember
we had a fight.

161
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.160
Yeah.

162
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.880
When my son was born,
my wife and I,

163
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.720
we had made up our mind that we would
not give our kids our tribal names.

164
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.080
So I gave my son a Zulu name.
"Simphiwe", which means gift.

165
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.600
- This looks nice.
- Yes, it looks very nice.

166
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.920
- Yeah.
- You're looking smart.

167
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.640
For Kenyans, your tribe betrays you.

168
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.240
That means that when
I meet you and ask you

169
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.800
"Hey, what's your name?"
and you say my name is Boniface

170
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.960
or my name is David, Sarah or Rachel.
They'll be like, "No, what's your name?"

171
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.920
They want to get your last name,
so that they know

172
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.400
how to place you tribally.

173
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.640
And so the identity in Kenyan politics

174
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.920
is not nationalism, patriotism,

175
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.680
core values, a bigger
vision for a better Kenya.

176
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.760
The identity of this country is tribe.

177
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.560
Your last name defines you.

178
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.840
So imagine you are the British.

179
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.040
A small country, very cold,

180
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.200
and you come across
a country in Africa.

181
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.080
Very warm, very good looking.
How do I conquer the people?

182
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.040
You divide them among tribes.

183
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.600
In that colony, you take
different tribes for different roles.

184
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.200
The Kikuyu play a big part
in this expansion.

185
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.360
They're a colourful people,
rich in legend and tradition,

186
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.880
but they're also highly intelligent.
Quick to learn

187
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.560
the white man's techniques
and pick up new ideas.

188
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.960
Kikuyus are money lovers.
Kambas are loyal servants.

189
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.680
Luhyas are cooks and watchmen.

190
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.920
All these descriptions were
actually done by the British.

191
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.320
So come independence, we have
the first president of Kenya,

192
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.160
Jomo Kenyatta, who is a Kikuyu.

193
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.080
And what does he do? To conquer the country,
he decides, you know what?

194
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.560
Kikuyus are supreme.
Kikuyus are important.

195
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.800
And what he did,
during the ensuing years,

196
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.680
is kill anyone who was a threat.

197
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.840
And you see that the British planted
the seed of tribalism,

198
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.720
but the first government of this country,
the Kenyatta government,

199
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.200
and subsequent governments, actually
watered the seeds of tribalism

200
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.200
and made it prosper
and become the culture of the country.

201
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.920
It has never happened before,
a serving head of state appearing

202
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.240
before the International
Criminal Court

203
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.960
on charges of crimes
against humanity.

204
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.040
That's what happened today
at The Hague.

205
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.440
President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya,

206
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.440
the son of the country's first
president post-independence,

207
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.240
faces charges
concerning his role

208
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.000
in widespread and brutal violence,
which followed the 2007 elections.

209
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.000
We cannot continue being
embarrassed to be called Kikuyu!

210
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.880
Let's see who will be against us.

211
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.920
We will go to their houses and
expose them as traitors!

212
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.000
"This is a traitor!
Shame on you, traitor!"

213
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.400
Kenya's vice president has denied

214
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.880
orchestrating post-election
violence in 2007.

215
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.880
William Ruto and journalist Arap Sang
have pleaded not guilty

216
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.680
to three counts
of crimes against humanity.

217
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.360
The ICC prosecution laws conceded
it is handling

218
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.680
the most challenging case
since its establishment.

219
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.040
As of today, three witnesses
pulled out of the case

220
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.080
against President Uhuru
Kenyatta, citing security fears.

221
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.080
The disappearance of ICC witness
Meshack Yebei is still a mystery.

222
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.520
Veteran journalist John Kituyi
of the Weekly Mirror was last evening killed

223
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.640
by unknown assailants
as he was on his way...

224
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.600
Two human rights activists
from the Oscar Foundation are gunned down.

225
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.960
Among them, the director of the foundation,
Oscar Kingara.

226
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.200
Many of the foot soldiers,
who it's claimed were

227
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.320
hired by the government
to do its dirty work,

228
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.520
have simply disappeared.

229
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.600
No more killings!

230
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.200
So listen, you are the police.

231
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.000
We are not armed and we have a right…

232
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.640
we have a right to protest.
And you have the right to protect me.

233
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.880
What you're going to do sir, you tell these
guys to search us because we're going in.

234
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.360
Can't you hear,
they are going to Parliament.

235
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.080
Are you deaf?

236
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.400
Keep throwing tear gas!

237
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.440
Stop dragging your feet
and get in there.

238
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.880
Beat up these people!

239
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.640
Why are you arresting me?
What have I done?

240
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.160
I haven't done anything!

241
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.160
Has Njeri seen you like this?

242
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.000
Hey Dad.

243
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.800
Daddy, your eye.

244
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.080
When are you going to open this eye?

245
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.040
Come here.

246
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.760
Even the dogs.

247
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.360
I need a good one.

248
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.720
Okay, pray.

249
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.080
Thank you for my Father
who art in heaven.

250
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.960
Thank you for my daddy

251
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.280
when he got hurt by the police...

252
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.600
please tell him to get a better job

253
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.600
not to hurt people and to be better.

254
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.320
- In Jesus' name, we pray amen.
- Amen.

255
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.160
Thank you.

256
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.520
I can't protect him.
I've never been able to protect him.

257
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.360
It's not something I can do.
I have many fears of losing him.

258
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.840
But the thought of him dying,

259
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.200
I mean the children,
the absence of a father,

260
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.800
what would I tell them?

261
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.640
He was fighting for, you know,
human rights and a better country.

262
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.800
And now why did he have to die?

263
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.680
Could he not have done this
in a way differently?

264
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.960
Kenya's top politicians were targeted
by the International Criminal Court

265
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.200
and it ended in another mistrial.

266
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.680
Like the president before him,
on Tuesday, Deputy William Ruto

267
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.840
saw the crimes against humanity
case against him collapse

268
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.400
because of lack of evidence.

269
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.760
Today I got a forward
of an email

270
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.480
from the Chief Justice,
Willy Mutunga.

271
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.440
And there's a hit list of people
who are going to be killed

272
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.920
by people working
for the president.

273
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.400
And my name apparently
is on that list.

274
00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.360
- What's that word, introspection?
- Reflect?

275
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.080
Yeah. And give your
children what you have not

276
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.120
given them in the past...
in their lives.

277
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.560
Cause they're just ten.
Your oldest is ten.

278
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.160
My oldest or our oldest?

279
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.400
I have given my oldest
and my youngest and my middle one...

280
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.280
- Enough time?
- My life.

281
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.480
You have given your country
your life.

282
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.120
So maybe now, you give your children
your life.

283
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.440
- There you have it.
- Then after that,

284
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.640
you can give the country
what is left

285
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.880
instead of giving your
children what is left.

286
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.320
I give my kids the best.

287
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.160
In order of importance, God…

288
00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.400
- Country, family.
- No.

289
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.840
What?

290
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.480
For you, I think
it's been country, then...

291
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.480
- Others.
- Others. God, family...

292
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.800
- How do you arrange them?
- Country first.

293
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.880
You've never been mistaken
about where country falls for you.

294
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.200
- Country comes first.
- Yeah.

295
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.360
Because when you fight for your country,
your kids benefit.

296
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.120
The revolution comes first,
then love follows.

297
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.640
God first family.

298
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.400
For President Uhuru Kenyatta
and his arch-political rival Raila Odinga,

299
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.280
the August election is a high-stakes rematch.

300
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.200
Raila Odinga, son of the country's
first vice-president.

301
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.960
Since then, the Odingas have
always been in opposition.

302
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.480
Red is the colour of Jubilee.

303
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.520
Their candidate is the incumbent.

304
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.760
Uhuru Kenyatta, son of
Kenya's first president.

305
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.520
The big political dynasties live on

306
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.760
more than 50 years after independence.

307
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.640
None of them believes in anything,
and to be honest with you, in this country

308
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.920
if you choose between NASA and Jubilee,
you're not choosing between any two ideals.

309
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.920
You're just saying who
is the better and nicer thief.

310
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.200
So the first step to getting elected
is to have a voter's card.

311
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.600
And if - Njeri, come.

312
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.840
So, today's the journey
that begins...

313
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.160
Could be, you mean,
the journey that begins.

314
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.040
No today, voting today,
coming to apply

315
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.920
for a voter's card in Starehe
shows that

316
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.280
my heart is made up that
I'm going to vie.

317
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.960
But I can always change my mind.

318
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.080
Another thing that we
need to think about...

319
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.000
Are you saying that with certainty?

320
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.280
No, you see, a wise man changes his mind.
A fool, never.

321
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.720
True, but are we
having this conversation?

322
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.840
It's ninety percent there,
and the ten percent...

323
00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.040
You told me that I must do a few things,
which I'm working towards that.

324
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.320
So there's my end of the bargain
that I must fulfil.

325
00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.760
- Mummy.
- Hey pumpkin.

326
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.720
Why you don't say hello to me?

327
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.760
Hi.

328
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.120
Hi Daddy.

329
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.920
Hi Nate.

330
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.160
Boni's a very closed person.

331
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.760
So I've struggled with that
because like I said,

332
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.560
Boni wakes up and he decides,
and he will think about it for long...

333
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.360
Even months.
He will just not mention it.

334
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.040
You don't come and tell me I'm vying
and you never told me about it.

335
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.840
I'm like, "What? You're running for office?"

336
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.360
No, we need to be on the same page.

337
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.640
For me, that's the one
thing that makes family.

338
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.480
That we have agreed that this
is what we are going to do.

339
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.680
Okay! Let's do this!

340
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.400
Thank you so much for coming today.

341
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.360
Ukweli Party is a new political party
that brings together citizens

342
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.440
who want to live in a Kenya where
everyone is empowered.

343
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.840
We may sound like the lone
voice in the wilderness,

344
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.400
but we're here to stay
and reclaim our country.

345
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.760
If someone has been a thief before,

346
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.720
accused of stealing before,
why are you electing them?

347
00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.360
We, as Kenyans, must rise up
and use common sense.

348
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.800
And so we're asking for
a ballot revolution.

349
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.520
Mwangi!

350
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.760
If you go to Parliament,
who will fight for us?

351
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.400
The money will destroy you!

352
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.560
I am going to fight them there!

353
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.320
You will find so much money,
and become blind toward us!

354
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.520
No one has ever helped us.

355
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.400
- Walk everywhere, people will listen.
- That's what I'll do.

356
00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.800
Do not be afraid.

357
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.800
We need someone who
will stand up for us.

358
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.160
This is how I'm feeling:

359
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.600
It's a new journey!

360
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.400
- So we'll be meeting every day?
- Every day, Monday to Friday.

361
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.080
Every morning, eight to ten.

362
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.120
In fact, I should be leaving now
to go to the office.

363
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.800
Eight to ten here, two hours.

364
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.840
We're following up on what
everybody said they'd do.

365
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.720
We want to know what you're
doing during the day,

366
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.880
like things you think in your head,
they need to go into this meeting.

367
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.600
Can we get at least five
to do a video next week?

368
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.440
Boni, concentrate.

369
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.480
Concentrate man! Concentrate here!

370
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.360
I'm listening to you.
I'm looking at you, yes.

371
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.960
Think. Think quick!
Boni, I have a job to do. So hurry up!

372
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.600
He's really easily distracted,
Boniface.

373
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.120
He's a great guy, but
he's easily distracted

374
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.800
and he has a lot of things on his mind
so he's not able to plan ahead.

375
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.400
So I try and get his
phone away from him

376
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.400
so that he can concentrate
on the planning and forward thinking.

377
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.280
I think he'll get used to it.
It's hard,

378
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.840
when I take his phone away

379
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.800
he tries to keep himself busy
with the dog or something else.

380
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.760
So it's a challenge,
but we'll get there.

381
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.400
I'm looking for that number.

382
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.600
Yeah okay, I'll tell you when it arrives.

383
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.000
- What next, on my list?
- That's it.

384
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.040
Okay. You, go.
What are you doing?

385
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.120
This is my wife, Njeri.

386
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.280
These are my kids.

387
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.320
Would they like candy?

388
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.160
You guys want candy?

389
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.240
- You guys want candy?
- Yes.

390
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.160
I'm running for MP, will you vote for me?

391
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.280
- Give me some money.
- Give you money?

392
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.280
I don't have money.

393
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.840
So we are supposed to
vote for you for free?

394
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.080
I was raised here.
This is home.

395
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.400
It may be home,
but you still have to pay.

396
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.240
- It's upstairs?
- Upstairs.

397
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.560
- This used to be your house?
- Yes.

398
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.440
My house was very small.

399
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.160
When my mum was alive,
we had a double decker.

400
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.840
So I used to sleep on top
then my mum down here.

401
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.920
Then we'd cook outside.

402
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.120
Jabu, would you live here?
Would you live here?

403
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.760
Never!

404
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.640
I would live there if I were you.

405
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.600
- You'd live there?
- Yeah.

406
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.640
It hurts to be poor, man.

407
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.280
You are taught to become
timid and avoid trouble

408
00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.280
as your default setting.

409
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.960
When you see trouble,
when you see problems, you run away.

410
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.720
I was the softest child,
I was the smallest child,

411
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.920
and they thought
I was very weak.

412
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.360
So they would call me "Softie".

413
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.720
I was born poor.
I grew up poor.

414
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.880
Single mother, seven kids.

415
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.920
I want better for my country.

416
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.680
A country where everyone
has a decent shot in life.

417
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.880
Doesn't matter if you're poor,

418
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.240
doesn't matter what tribe
or what gender.

419
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.680
That you matter to this country.

420
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.800
And this country
knows that you exist.

421
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.720
On August 8th

422
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.360
vote for Boniface Mwangi,

423
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.560
a young man from here.

424
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.760
That's my mum. She used to
sell books on the streets.

425
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.720
She died in the year 2000,
when I was 17.

426
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.600
So you are vying for MP?

427
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.680
I knew your mother well.

428
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.360
Punitive taxes
should be eliminated.

429
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.560
They keep taxing you
without providing services.

430
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.520
When elected I'll make

431
00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:42.720
the city police wear uniforms to
identify themselves

432
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.400
because they keep harassing vendors,
like they did to my late mother.

433
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.960
They harassed me too
when I was a vendor here.

434
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.120
- I don't have money.
- Just buy me a soda!

435
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.640
I don't have money.

436
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.800
Just 100 shillings.

437
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.320
Boniface is a good person
but he doesn't give money.

438
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.120
Money!

439
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.600
Money is the biggest problem.

440
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.400
Kenyans don't get
service from their government.

441
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.880
So what happens is every five years when
a politician comes to you to ask for vote,

442
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.040
that's when you ask for everything that
the person was supposed to do for five years.

443
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.360
That's your time to
get as much as possible

444
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.360
from this person, because you
might never see them,

445
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.000
because whatever they say,
they might never do.

446
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.920
So you can't trust this person.

447
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.880
All I'm asking is to work for you.

448
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.960
- You can work.
- But our stomachs need to be full!

449
00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.560
And the thing that we're trying to say is,
all those things can be done.

450
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.520
But they can be done after this person
gets into Parliament

451
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.840
because that's where
the money and the resources are.

452
00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.480
That is a big mindset change.

453
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.360
And every politician who doesn't want
to do the right thing likes that.

454
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.960
So what do they do?

455
00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.600
They come with a car.
They stand in the car.

456
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.000
They wave. They throw T-shirts.

457
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.520
They throw a bit of money
and off they go.

458
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
<i>Call me Casanova</i>

459
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.280
<i>I'm coming over, Jaguar</i>

460
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.400
<i>In my Rover</i>
<i>They watching over</i>

461
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.120
Popular musician, Charles Njagua
Kenya alias Jaguar,

462
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.520
will now fly the Jubilee flag
in Starehe constituency

463
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.440
during the August elections.

464
00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.440
So we have a guy called
Jaguar, very dodgy.

465
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.480
Has a lot of money,
no one knows from where.

466
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.640
Track record, maybe one song.

467
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.840
You know, musician
who produced one song.

468
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.160
You want him to manage
the city affairs!

469
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.160
Come on people of Starehe,
you can do better than that.

470
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.120
- Are we voting for Jaguar?
- Yes!

471
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.120
You didn't care where I came from!

472
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.280
You didn't ask me
where my wife is!

473
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.440
But just in case you want
to know, I have two wives.

474
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.040
Get off! You'll scuff the car!

475
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.400
Are you Kikuyu?

476
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.120
Are you not Kikuyu?

477
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.640
- What is your party?
- Ukweli party.

478
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.080
- Who are you supporting for president?
- I just care about the MP seat.

479
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.120
- We want to know who you support.
- I respect everyone.

480
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.560
You must be for Raila Odinga.

481
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.480
Listen, I am not with Raila
or Uhuru or anyone else.

482
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.840
I'm here running for the MP seat.

483
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.480
The most important question is:
what is my platform?

484
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.160
It's my policies that matter.

485
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.960
If there's a problem,
you don't call the president!

486
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.760
You will call me, as your MP.
I want to be your voice.

487
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.600
Yes, but we might love many women,
but can only marry one!

488
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.360
Hello.

489
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.440
Give me some money.

490
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.120
I don't have anything to give.

491
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.920
- You must be a weak candidate.
- Please vote for me. I'll work for you.

492
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.840
Look at this broke idiot!

493
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.360
These women love money,
just give them something.

494
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.720
We will vote for Jaguar!

495
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.840
Mbogo!

496
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.120
No, it's Jaguar!

497
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.840
Jaguar!

498
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:03.040
Mbogo is the right candidate!

499
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.880
- Stupid Luo!
- The Luo tribe will vote for Mbogo!

500
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.680
You know, why am I doing this?

501
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.600
Why am I doing this to myself?

502
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.280
You're dealing with a lot
of silliness and stupidity.

503
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.640
Naila, come and see.

504
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.560
Come and see a goat,
where meat comes from.

505
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.360
Nate, Nate!

506
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.920
All of them are hard.

507
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.160
Get a ripe one.

508
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.840
You are my passion.

509
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.720
Or take this one and make it passionate.

510
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.480
When you look at Boni, how is he doing?

511
00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.360
Honestly.

512
00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.440
I don't know. Sometimes
I think he's just in motion.

513
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.480
Cause sometimes when he stops,

514
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.360
I think he gets overwhelmed
by what this really means.

515
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:48.240
And it feels like just jumping
into a river of crocodiles.

516
00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.840
I'm on my way.

517
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.600
Okay, thank you sir.

518
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.080
Daddy is watching a book.

519
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.600
Launching a book.

520
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.120
I'm going to the launch, but I'll pass
downstairs to my barber for a cut.

521
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.360
Like this.
You have done your makeup.

522
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.760
- No, you're fine.
- You have done your makeup.

523
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.560
I just need a line.

524
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.880
I launched my book two days ago.

525
00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.400
During my book launch,
someone gave a letter to my wife.

526
00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.920
And she tells me that
the letter was a threat to me,

527
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.960
that something is going to
happen to me.

528
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.960
And beyond that, the person
purported to have written

529
00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.800
that letter claims that he is part
of the team that killed Jacob Juma,

530
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.880
and the same thing that happened
to Jacob Juma is going to happen to me.

531
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.160
So that's the story of today.
I'm about to get to the office.

532
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.080
Let's see how the day goes.

533
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.480
Unexplained deaths are becoming commonplace
as we get into the campaigns.

534
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.960
Jacob Juma was gunned down
late last evening.

535
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.160
One of the things that stands out

536
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.280
is how vocal he has been on matters
to do with corruption.

537
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.160
Executions or police or security
that is killing is nothing new.

538
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.480
It's a well-trodden rich path
that the Kenyan police has been on.

539
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.120
Four suspected police officers
walked into a hospital

540
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.800
and shot a man dead.

541
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.680
Do not come
home, they will kill you.

542
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.800
Activist Boniface Mwangi
says he fears for his life after

543
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.880
receiving death threats that for the first
time target his wife and children as well.

544
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.280
Damn! My dad just found out.

545
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.280
Now you will have to talk to him
because I am driving.

546
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.440
Hello.

547
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.960
Hello Boni.

548
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.480
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

549
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.560
Just got home, and I'm shocked
by reports from my wife.

550
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.760
Boni, we are worried,
very worried, extremely worried.

551
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.600
This is a very dangerous situation
and it really bothers us.

552
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.480
I understand.

553
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.480
I just fear for you.

554
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.040
I'm scared and I told
myself to support for you.

555
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.480
Me and the kids, which means...

556
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.960
I have to look over my back
for I don't know how long.

557
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.440
I keep thinking with every phone call
that something is terribly wrong.

558
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.040
Or just that gut feeling.
Or when I'm going home, I'm afraid.

559
00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.000
I can't hide.
I'm in the car with my children.

560
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.160
Have a safe journey.
We will be praying for you.

561
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.800
So I feel like I need to be strong
and make this look like, you know,

562
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.520
it's not the end of the world.

563
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.680
It seems mad, but it's gonna be fine.

564
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.720
So, I just need to be very strong.

565
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.640
I'm not afraid of death.
So that's not a scary thing for me.

566
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.360
I'm just concerned about my family
and your well-being and...

567
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.880
How is your dying
and my well-being not connected?

568
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.000
You need to have an ideal you live
for that is worth dying for.

569
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.960
I am willing to die for my country.

570
00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.120
If it means me dying, for Kenya
to be better for my kids...

571
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.720
You think it will be better if you die?

572
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.520
I don't want to die, but if I die
and my death changes a few things...

573
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.600
- What if it doesn't?
- If it doesn't, then it was a waste.

574
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.520
So how does that make you feel?

575
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.920
How does it make you feel?

576
00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.120
I'm not feeling very well.

577
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.280
I was campaigning and along
the way I started feeling dizzy.

578
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.560
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

579
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.760
So now we're gonna ride,
thanks to you, you've let me down.

580
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.920
He's gonna ride and if we fall down
and he breaks his neck...

581
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.920
Your husband will kill me.

582
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.800
It's your problem and if I die,
my husband I swear he'll come after you

583
00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.640
and literally crush your balls and then
cut them and then feed them to the dogs.

584
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.120
Anyway listen, we're gonna leave now.

585
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.000
I love you much and I have to go.
I have to get this guy some medication

586
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.160
and get him fixed up.
I'll speak to you later.

587
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.600
He's insisting to ride a bike
because fucking Martin let me down.

588
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.400
We're talking about the race.

589
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.560
What is it about us
that we are always in campaign mode?

590
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.240
We're talking about 2022,
we haven't finished 2017,

591
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.800
and we don't seem to even be ready.

592
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.200
The biggest problem with the Kenyan psyche

593
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.800
is we are always in panic mode.

594
00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.080
Why? Because our election
cycles are winner-takes-it-all.

595
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.840
What needs to change in this country

596
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.440
is we need to develop a politic
and a brand of politicians

597
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.560
who actually stand for something.
Stand for anything.

598
00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.000
Your face doesn't have any.

599
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.920
It's white, it's white.

600
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.080
Whee! Whee!

601
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.240
My fingers are freezing.

602
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.680
Oh my gosh.

603
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.920
Hi, how are you, Jabu?

604
00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:21.720
Good.

605
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.040
How's America?

606
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.640
I am going to bed, I had a long day.

607
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.280
Tomorrow's Saturday, what are you doing?

608
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.040
I'm shooting a video
for the songs, the music video.

609
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.840
<i>Boni, Boni</i>

610
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.600
<i>People of Starehe come out and vote</i>

611
00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.760
<i>Fight corruption in Starehe</i>

612
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.760
<i>Get clean water in Starehe</i>

613
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.960
<i>With Boniface Mwangi</i>

614
00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.320
<i>Let's fight for our rights Starehe</i>

615
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.320
Njeri, you should sing for me a song.
You used to sing songs.

616
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.800
<i>I was about to be eaten by wild animals</i>

617
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.080
<i>Waiting for you my love</i>

618
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.920
<i>I was calling the wild animals</i>

619
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.800
<i>Your name my love</i>

620
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.200
I want to donate to Boniface's campaign

621
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.000
cause he was asking people to donate.

622
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.360
And I just wanted to do something
for the country, but it was not easy.

623
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.160
You couldn't meet anybody who was really
genuinely interested in making a difference.

624
00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:40.520
Vote for Boniface Mwangi for Starehe MP.

625
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.080
When I joined, we had
problems with funds.

626
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.440
There was no money to
run the campaigns.

627
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.880
Immediately, we sat
together and brainstormed.

628
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.840
And you know, if Boniface
has a million followers,

629
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.400
and if all these people follow him
because they want change,

630
00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.280
then surely they'd be willing to fund it.

631
00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.880
My name is Boniface Mwangi.
I want to say thank you so much

632
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.240
and I want to ask for your continued support.
Give whatever you can.

633
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.400
10 bob, 20 bob, 30 bob.
Support this campaign

634
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.160
and I'm going to become the next member
of Parliament for Starehe.

635
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.720
Boniface has revolutionized

636
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.320
the way that political
party campaigns are funded in Kenya.

637
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.600
So he was able to raise
about 1.6 million shillings

638
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.320
from individual donors,
especially small donors.

639
00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:31.400
Don't ever give up on voting,
just vote for the person

640
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.680
you trust in and one day
we'll change this country.

641
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.960
He's a good guy.
We need to vote for him.

642
00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.280
- So he's okay?
- Yes, he is.

643
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.080
- You'll vote for him?
- Yes, I will.

644
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.320
Thanks.

645
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.440
You will vote for me!

646
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.160
In so many ways, Boniface Mwangi
is a radical and a maverick.

647
00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.120
So he pioneers some of these
unconventional approaches

648
00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.520
to organizing, to political expression,
to activism.

649
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.920
Activist!

650
00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:11.200
He just crossed over the one million
shilling mark. Okay, here's the thing.

651
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.440
Boniface Mwangi is trying to
do politics the right way.

652
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.240
If a voter is willing
to put his money into a candidate,

653
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:23.760
he's most likely also
to put his vote to the same candidate.

654
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.680
I'm Boniface Mwangi.

655
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.080
- Oh my God. It's you!
- Yeah.

656
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.840
You look more handsome in person!

657
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.520
For real!

658
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.080
It is the first time
we are seeing a candidate run

659
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.800
on principles in a major
constituency in this country.

660
00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.160
We must have
equal representation.

661
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.480
I promise that when I'm elected,

662
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.960
I will fight for us to get our fair share.

663
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.400
Come on babies.

664
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.280
It's today. It's today.

665
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.840
Who's graduating,
who's moving on up?

666
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.800
Which one?

667
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.520
This one, sorry this one!

668
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.880
Thank you!

669
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.920
<i>Kindergarten</i>
<i>went by so fast</i>

670
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.280
<i>But now it's time to go</i>

671
00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.680
Just 32 days before the country
heads to the polls.

672
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.440
The electoral commission is
expressing confidence

673
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.440
that the technology to be used
during the process will not fail.

674
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.320
The success of this whole ballot
depends on what happens in this building.

675
00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.840
The Independent Electoral and
Boundaries Commission, or IEBC,

676
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.440
is the arbiter of the whole process.

677
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.200
There is no room for
manipulation of numbers here.

678
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.600
What are we saying?
What we are saying is

679
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.520
that the results submitted
from the polling stations are final.

680
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.400
Immediately, they are transmitted.

681
00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.600
It will be available to Kenyans,
it will be available to the media,

682
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.680
and it will be available to all
the stakeholders in the process.

683
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.840
He's called me,
but he's not talking to me.

684
00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.560
He's forgotten he's called me.

685
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.240
He could at least have said hi
and tell me what's going on.

686
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.760
Get off me!

687
00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.160
What did you write?
What is it about?

688
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.120
Father's Day.

689
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.800
- It was an assignment?
- Yeah.

690
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.400
What did you write in the card?
Can you read what you wrote in the card?

691
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.360
Okay.

692
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.720
Dear Mum, I love you very, very much.

693
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.720
You are thoughtful and provide
me with the things I need.

694
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.600
I hope this day will be great for you.

695
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:35.760
And I will try to save up
for a camera for you.

696
00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.360
Why did you write "Dear Mum"?

697
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.160
You don't have any message for him at all?

698
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.320
How you doing? I guess.

699
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.960
That he misses out on his children,
it breaks my heart.

700
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.600
I know the kind of man,
husband, and father he wants to be

701
00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.280
and that's who I am with.

702
00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.600
That guy who wants to be that.

703
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.560
I'm afraid the day I stop believing
that that's the person he wants to be,

704
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.280
I'll be with who he is.

705
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.960
And for any married couple,

706
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:29.480
when you get to a place
of indifference, that's the end.

707
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.760
I have a letter from my wife.

708
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.520
It's been almost ten years

709
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.200
and I don't think we ever wrote letters
like this before between us.

710
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.440
I don't know where to start,
what to say.

711
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.480
I've been agonizing about
our current situation.

712
00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.880
And however I look at it,
it's not easy.

713
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.120
Right now the kids are happy.

714
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:09.360
No one knows who they are
or what their story is.

715
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.040
They're happy in school,
normal, almost stable.

716
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.440
Jabali told me yesterday
that he's having bad dreams

717
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.880
that someone bad has come
and taken him away.

718
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.160
Have you taken your medicine?

719
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.800
I need to bring it for you.
Let me get it for you now.

720
00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:37.040
I feel like my two worlds
are not in the same place anymore.

721
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.160
And I have to find a way
to balance them.

722
00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.240
And this is the hardest part for me
at this point in our lives.

723
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.240
I don't know what is best, but I think
I want to believe that our kids come first.

724
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.400
That we'll do whatever it takes
to ensure their safety and well-being.

725
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.000
Clearly, she doesn't want to come back home

726
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.720
and I understand why.

727
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.040
That's the story, man.

728
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.600
We battled the big fish
for the nomination!

729
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.520
All that's left is a small fish
that can't defeat us.

730
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.240
Put that away.
Let's keep following him.

731
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.360
We'll get more money.

732
01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.440
I need 200,000 manifestos

733
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.400
and 50,000 flyers for two million shillings.

734
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.200
Flyers and posters.

735
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.800
Posters and manifesto.

736
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.880
Why was that not in the list of actions?

737
01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.520
Everything has to be on that list.

738
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.400
If it's not on that list,
we don't know. We can't chase people.

739
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.880
Every fucking street,
there's photos of ugly Jaguar,

740
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.320
like it's as if there's
no other competitor.

741
01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.560
Here on Kipande Street...
Have you seen what I sent you?

742
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.240
Come see.

743
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.000
Come look at this. There is no way
we will win if they're all over the place.

744
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.600
People don't even remember
what you look like.

745
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.760
You're mistaken because
we don't have T-shirts here.

746
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:21.720
Then he's not an honest candidate.

747
01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.760
Fine, no need for all the noise.

748
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.680
Just keep telling yourself that.

749
01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.120
It doesn't change the fact
we don't have T-shirts.

750
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.040
Spread the word, there are no
T-shirts in this van.

751
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
They were threatening me,

752
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.160
they'll spoil their vote.
I told them, "go!"

753
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.880
They are used to being begged.

754
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.040
Go fuck yourself.

755
01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.040
They're fucking dickheads.
They don't even have voter cards!

756
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.040
They're used to intimidating people.

757
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.360
People have become comfortable with us.

758
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.320
It will be a comfortable win.

759
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.520
I pray everything goes well.

760
01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.080
Right now what we need to do
is go one-on-one with a man

761
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:37.760
who has moved from being a photojournalist
to a political activist and

762
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:41.960
now he wants to try his hand at politics.
Boniface Mwangi.

763
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.240
The news of you now taking
a whole new direction,

764
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.640
because you've changed
who you are now.

765
01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.120
This is gonna be the second
time you're making a change.

766
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.000
I can only imagine how scared I'd be,
first of all, as a wife,

767
01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.360
to see my husband taking to the streets

768
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.280
being that activist.
Now he's taking that to Parliament.

769
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.240
How do they handle what it is you do?

770
01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.680
So my wife, when we started
she was very scared.

771
01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840
But she knew deep down
that she couldn't stop me.

772
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.920
So what ultimately happens,
if you can't beat them you join them.

773
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.400
Okay, so she joins you in the streets?

774
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.440
She comes with me to the streets.
She's been arrested together with me.

775
01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.920
That is a strong woman,
I must say.

776
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.760
- Who wears the pants in your home?
- My wife.

777
01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.200
I had a feeling
that that was the case.

778
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.760
You're loud outside, but inside
she tells you, "sit down, be humble".

779
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.160
The truth is,
if you ever find a man

780
01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.280
who says that he runs the house,
that man is a dictator.

781
01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.360
- N-J?
- E-R-I.

782
01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.360
Oh, so that's how you pronounce it.
You don't pronounce the N?

783
01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.080
I don't struggle being a mother.

784
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.440
Being Boni's wife, that's hard.

785
01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.200
Because then I am his wife.

786
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.560
People don't see me for me.

787
01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.400
They don't know me.

788
01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.960
It's like I don't exist.
It's like I don't have my dreams,

789
01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.880
I don't have my ambitions,
I don't have normal struggles,

790
01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.280
girl problems.
It's like I don't have all that.

791
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.280
Why are you introducing me
as somebody's,

792
01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.960
while I am standing
right here myself?

793
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:47.360
Hi Njeri.

794
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.200
I want to ask you...

795
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.600
Put words into what you are thinking

796
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.640
so that I hear what is on your mind.

797
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.400
Politics is a very bad thing
actually in this country.

798
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:09.240
And the way it's going,
it's going to get nastier and dirtier.

799
01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.680
And if I don't have someone
that I can talk to and share things

800
01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.040
before I do them without making these
long distance calls...

801
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.840
I think I'll be caught up
in the whole nonsense

802
01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.280
in a way that I don't want to be.

803
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.840
So, I would prefer that you come back.

804
01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.440
I want to be there for you.

805
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.880
Like totally, like in a heartbeat.

806
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.680
But I need you to be there for me.

807
01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.680
This is the first time I think
since we've come to the U.S.

808
01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.920
that you've done nothing but
talk to me and look at me.

809
01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.800
Because normally I am on my phone.

810
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.520
Or in the dark, sleeping

811
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.200
and I'm talking to myself.

812
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.840
Because I want to hear your
voice before I go to bed.

813
01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.000
- Okay.
- Bye for now, love you.

814
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.080
I want another baby.

815
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.520
Hey! We missed you Daddy!

816
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.880
Hey son.

817
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.560
All the anxiety, the nervousness,

818
01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.360
everything, everything I had...
I'm just excited.

819
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.080
I'm just excited.

820
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.040
Excited, excited, excited to be home!

821
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.040
Hello?

822
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.240
How are you?

823
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.560
I am calling on behalf of Boniface Mwangi.

824
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.080
So you are not a registered
voter in Starehe?

825
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.080
You can leave word for him.

826
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.840
How has it been
trying to settle back in?

827
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.200
I'm not even sure how I'm doing
on that front about settling.

828
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.480
Everything is everywhere.
Everyone is everywhere.

829
01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.280
Oh! Dad has a billboard!

830
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.600
Hey, my sister.

831
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.720
- Talk to Dad.
- Hi Dad.

832
01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.160
- Talk to Dad, talk to Dad.
- What, Dad?

833
01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.160
- I don't know how to skate.
- I'll teach you!

834
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.120
Okay, but we have penguins so they could...

835
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.760
Okay, Naila, Daddy doesn't
want us to skate now.

836
01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.120
He wants us to come where he is.

837
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.800
Don't cry.

838
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.160
Can we be here for Daddy?

839
01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.280
Yeah?

840
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.840
Being here for Daddy
means you don't cry, okay?

841
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.640
Being here for Daddy...

842
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.600
Being here for Daddy means
we don't cry.

843
01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.120
- Okay?
- Yeah.

844
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.520
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

845
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.640
So this is my long-loving,
suffering wife.

846
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.080
- Hi everyone.
- Hi.

847
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.000
When people ask you,
"What's your name?", what do you say?

848
01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:20.680
Say your name out loud
like it's yours.

849
01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.400
I can't hear you!

850
01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:26.240
Say your name!

851
01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.440
We are here because you are here.

852
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.240
We are going where we're going because you
believe that there is a better future, right?

853
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.160
We deserve better.

854
01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.320
We Kenyans deserve better.

855
01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.400
As a generation, as my son is saying...
We believe.

856
01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.560
So let's keep this going.
Whatever happens on the 8th,

857
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.120
many of you might not be
voters of Starehe.

858
01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.760
But you've given of yourselves,
whatever you have given.

859
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.320
Give it all.

860
01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.160
Whatever happens on the 8th,
we have already won.

861
01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.320
As far as I am concerned, we have won.

862
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.880
Because the way people are thinking,

863
01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.480
the way people are moving,
we have already won.

864
01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.920
So let's keep it going,
and let's keep believing. Thank you.

865
01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.680
Welcome back. This is our continuing
coverage of the breaking news

866
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.880
on the shock death of Chris Msando,

867
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.560
the data center
and infrastructure manager of the IEBC.

868
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.880
There is no room for
manipulation of numbers here.

869
01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.400
What are we saying? What we are saying
is that, at the end of the voting day,

870
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.360
no result can be transmitted for more

871
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.520
than the people who have been identified
in that polling station.

872
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.840
I don't know if I'm making myself clear?

873
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.400
He was actually murdered,
tortured and killed.

874
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.320
In fact, possibly he was
also strangled before he was killed.

875
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.720
We're expecting a press conference
from NASA in a moment.

876
01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.800
In the meantime,
we want to take you to Bomet

877
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.920
where President Uhuru Kenyatta
is addressing the crowd.

878
01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080
He might talk about this.
Let's listen in.

879
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.240
My colleague is still here with me.
We're following that.

880
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.560
President Kenyatta and
his deputy William Ruto

881
01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.920
did not mention in the entire speech...
We've got reporters there,

882
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.560
they did not talk about this
breaking news out of the IEBC.

883
01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.440
Oh my gosh, these guys
will do anything.

884
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.240
I don't know who these guys are,

885
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.520
but they're people who'll
do anything at any cost.

886
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:40.000
In terms of the thing that
I fear the most, causing panic.

887
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.480
I mean they did, they scored
a hundred and one percent.

888
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.160
Because they did cause panic.
Why would they kill him?

889
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.640
Who killed him and why?
Then that they cut his hands.

890
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.880
So that what?
Biometric fingerprints?

891
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.440
They want to use his
fingerprints for what?

892
01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.440
Altering the system, why?

893
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.000
Thank you.

894
01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:15.120
It makes me question a lot of things.

895
01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.680
Because for that guy to have been killed,
it's not even how he was found

896
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.160
or how his body was found,
but for him to have been killed...

897
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:30.200
It's like sending a warning
signal to IEBC officials.

898
01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.840
That there's a way things need to go

899
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.840
and if they don't go the way
we want them to go

900
01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.640
there are consequences.

901
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.880
What does your gut feeling
tell you about the election?

902
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.840
I don't know.
I think I'm in a bit of a daze.

903
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.760
This campaign...

904
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.200
My head is buried in one place.

905
01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:01.560
I'm focused in there.

906
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:05.160
And in there, it feels like
we're doing the right thing.

907
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.400
I'm hopeful that things will not go bad.

908
01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.880
Hello.

909
01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.800
It's very heavy, of course! So is a bullet.
It's heavy so it won't kill you.

910
01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.000
I can't walk around with a bulletproof vest.
It's very heavy.

911
01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.640
- You're wearing it, maybe not now...
- No, not today.

912
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.520
- Yeah, but you're wearing it.
- When?

913
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.320
- You'll be wearing it!
- But...

914
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.560
Wait, wait, don't say but, just wait.

915
01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.760
Stand there and wait.

916
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.920
There's nothing to protect my balls?!

917
01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:50.000
<i>Freedom never comes for free</i>
<i>We vote tribal or real cash, ask Boni</i>

918
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.720
<i>I'm richer than my neighbour</i>
<i>but we're both in a slum</i>

919
01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:04.400
<i>If the rich always win</i>
<i>why should the popular run?</i>

920
01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.560
<i>Unless democracy is a word</i>
<i>we say only for fun</i>

921
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.680
My people, my people, my people.
Good morning Naila.

922
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.040
Naila, Naila.

923
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.760
Wakey, wakey.

924
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.560
Where is Jabu?

925
01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.240
Jabali, wakey, wakey.

926
01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.960
Come, come, come, come.

927
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.600
Hi Mum.

928
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.480
Hi, how are you?
Did you sleep well?

929
01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:08.960
Come.

930
01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.400
- Are we going to school?
- No.

931
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.200
No, no, no, not to school.

932
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.240
Where?

933
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.880
Push this behind you.

934
01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:23.400
- Where are we going?
- We are going to vote for Daddy.

935
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.720
I thought you said that we're too young.

936
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.280
We're gonna vote for Dad.

937
01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.920
Yes, we're going to vote for Dad.

938
01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.160
Good morning.

939
01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.560
Shoot your gun in the air!

940
01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.480
People will die here!

941
01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.320
Are you okay?

942
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.320
Lie down over here.

943
01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.760
I'm looking for my shoes.

944
01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.000
You won't get them now.

945
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.720
This doesn't even have
a password and it's on.

946
01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.360
They are throwing tear gas at us, Boni.

947
01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.640
They are throwing tear gas at us!

948
01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.760
We've been here since 3 a.m.

949
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.080
We've been in the line,
and we haven't voted.

950
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.360
The lines are not moving.

951
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.280
Talk to them, Boni!

952
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.120
Violence has broken out in Kenya
following yesterday's general election

953
01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.440
after the leader of the opposition,
Raila Odinga,

954
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.720
said that
the Electoral Commission's IT system

955
01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.960
had been hacked
to manipulate results.

956
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.000
A British firm has been accused

957
01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.040
of running an online smear campaign

958
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.920
against NASA leader Raila Odinga.

959
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.360
Top executives of Cambridge Analytica

960
01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.000
were caught on camera boasting
about their covert campaigns

961
01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.960
that have helped politicians, including
President Kenyatta, win elections.

962
01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.080
Stop killing us!

963
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.800
Stop killing us!

964
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.400
I talked to OCS central.

965
01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.960
We have permission to hold
a peaceful demonstration.

966
01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:50.040
We are starting at Freedom Corner.
We provided a route.

967
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.440
- Where is the letter?
- Where is it?

968
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.480
Someone has a copy,
but I have it on my phone.

969
01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.560
We love you!

970
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.200
We love you!

971
01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:02.080
- We can't go to the county commander.
- You said you talked to him!

972
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:06.600
We gave him our letter!
Madam, wait! Don't beat us!

973
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.800
Look, they even signed.

974
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.880
Tell these guys to leave.

975
01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:24.640
Please do not beat us.

976
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.120
We are peaceful.
So we can walk?

977
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.120
No, go back!

978
01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.680
Where are we going back to?

979
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.200
Don't beat us.

980
01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.880
There's no need.

981
01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.920
There's no need to beat us.
We have not broken any laws.

982
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.320
There's no need.

983
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.600
Madam, there's no need.
We are walking on the sidewalk.

984
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.080
Listen, why do you want to hurt us?

985
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.200
Madam, we will get beaten with you.
Let's walk with her.

986
01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.640
Stand next to her, so if they beat us,
they beat us together.

987
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.800
If you throw tear gas,
we'll be together.

988
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.000
We will walk with you.

989
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.920
We will stick with you.

990
01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.760
We stick with them when
they throw tear gas.

991
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.040
We shall suffer together!

992
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.400
Are you ready?
Shoot that thing!

993
01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.040
I'm not going anywhere!

994
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:48.760
Where will you take me?

995
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.840
I'm not going anywhere!

996
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.800
My shirt is on fire.

997
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.640
For Raila Odinga to literally say,
I'm putting down my hard stance.

998
01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.040
I'm quitting the opposition
to work with the government.

999
01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.480
There must be something at stake for him.
It is something we might never understand

1000
01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.280
because we really don't know
what were the contents of the agreement

1001
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.440
between these two individuals.

1002
01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.600
Indeed, Raila's influence seems
to have grown as a result of the handshake.

1003
01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.600
People died for Raila Odinga,

1004
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.520
but he has forgotten them.

1005
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.760
All these politicians are
a pile of shit.

1006
01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.840
Have they pronounced the winner?

1007
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.840
- Yes Naila.
- Did you win or did you lose?

1008
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.120
And? And?

1009
01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.560
Go on, we're waiting for it.

1010
01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.720
- Guess.
- You won!

1011
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.600
No.

1012
01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.400
- You lost.
- I lost.

1013
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.800
I lost, yes, I lost.

1014
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.920
- To who?
- Jaguar.

1015
01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.960
- So, you didn't win the...
- No.

1016
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.960
- But Jaguar's the winner, not you.
- Not me.

1017
01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.880
- Can I give you a hug?
- Go and give your dad a hug.

1018
01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.160
Thank you.

1019
01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.880
Next time, yes next time, Nate.

1020
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.280
Wait, there's a next time?

1021
01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.800
I think I'm secretly
happy that he lost.

1022
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.000
Not because I wanted him to.
Honestly, if he had won,

1023
01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.240
it would have been the greatest.

1024
01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:18.400
I'm still hoping that
he can be a family man

1025
01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:23.040
and I want him home
for his children.

1026
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.960
Nate!

1027
01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.240
I can't find cooking oil.

1028
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.560
- This one?
- Which one?

1029
01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.000
- This?
- Yes, that is cooking oil.

1030
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:42.400
Thanks.

1031
01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.240
Siri, how do you make cereal?

1032
01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.600
Here's what I found.

1033
01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.200
The recommended ratio of traditional oats
to water or milk is one cup...

1034
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.760
Get set, go!

1035
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.640
We were fighting for country.

1036
01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:21.080
We were fighting for
a better world, a better Kenya.

1037
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.960
We were there together.

1038
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.080
But now I feel like I
am just fighting for us.

1039
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.320
- Nice to see you!
- Good to see you.

1040
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.200
- I know it didn't work very well.
- Yeah.

1041
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.440
- But maybe there's always a next time, okay?
- True.

1042
01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.120
- We really wanted change, okay?
- Yes.

1043
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.400
There will always be a next time.

1044
01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.440
- And that's good, okay?
- Okay.

1045
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.480
- I'm George.
- Boniface.

1046
01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:50.320
Yes, I know! I know you're Boniface.

1047
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.360
I think I need to stay here and fight,

1048
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.800
but not even from the front line.

1049
01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.760
I think right now I need
to fight for my family.

1050
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:56.360
