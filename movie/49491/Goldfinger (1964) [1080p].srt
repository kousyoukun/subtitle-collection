1
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,630
Yahoo!

2
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,348
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

3
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,147
Mr. Ramirez and his friends
will be out of business.

4
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,692
At least he won't be using heroin-flavored
bananas to finance revolutions.

5
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,454
Don't go back to your hotel, seÃ±or.

6
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,871
They'll be watching it.

7
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,833
There's a plane leaving
for Miami in an hour.

8
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,200
I'll be on it,

9
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,407
but first I have some
unfinished business to attend to.

10
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,891
Forgive me.

11
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,148
Why do you always wear that thing?

12
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,980
I have a slight inferiority complex.

13
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,605
Where was I? Yes.

14
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,251
Shocking.

15
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,552
Positively shocking.

16
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,119
How's this?

17
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,666
That's nice. Very nice.

18
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,170
Just here?

19
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,921
No, a little lower, darling.

20
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,553
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

21
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,472
Felix! Felix, how are you?

22
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,585
-Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
-Hello.

23
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,678
-Felix, say hello to Dink.
-Hi, Dink.

24
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,314
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

25
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,060
Man talk.

26
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,233
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

27
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,396
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica,
didn't they?

28
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,395
But what's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

29
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,527
Not anymore, you're not.
Signal from London.

30
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,074
Might have known M
wouldn't book me into

31
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,657
the best hotel in Miami Beach
out of pure gratitude.

32
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,163
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

33
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,906
Auric Goldfinger.

34
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,577
Sounds like a French nail varnish.

35
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,916
He's British, but he doesn't sound like it.

36
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,211
Big operator. Worldwide interests,
all apparently quite reputable.

37
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,086
Owns one of the finest
stud farms in the States.

38
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,883
What's the tie-up with Washington?

39
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,007
He's clean, as far as CIA is concerned.

40
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,054
And where do I find him?

41
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,981
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

42
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,734
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners

43
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,606
every day for a week.

44
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,989
Morning, Mr. Simmons.
Ready for our little game?

45
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,163
Sure, I'm ready.

46
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,411
When you're 10 grand in the hole,

47
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,952
you're ready for anything.

48
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,285
Could I have my usual seat?

49
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,161
You and your suntan.

50
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,418
That Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

51
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,880
Same stakes?

52
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,550
Let's double it. $5 a point.

53
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,089
Did you say five?

54
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,505
My luck's got to change sometime.

55
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,926
Okay.

56
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,604
I'll get back to the office
and cable M you're on the job.

57
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,983
You can fill me in on the rest at dinner.

58
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,099
Fine, I'll call you later.

59
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,909
-Four.
-So soon?

60
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:10,417
-How many?
-Seven, 12, 18, 32, 44.

61
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,216
Miss?

62
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
Hey, what do you...

63
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:27,188
That's Mr. Goldfinger's suite.

64
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,690
Yes, I know.

65
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,569
You're very sweet.

66
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,867
He just drew the king of clubs.

67
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,909
That makes his count 59.

68
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,116
He's got a diamond run, eight, nine, ten.

69
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,464
He's holding on to the six of spades,

70
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,672
so I guess he thinks you want it.

71
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,213
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

72
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,882
He needs kings and queens.

73
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,638
-Who are you?
-Bond. James Bond.

74
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,355
Come on, come on.

75
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,414
That's more like it.

76
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,615
-What's your name?
-Jill.

77
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,542
-Jill who?
-Jill Masterson.

78
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,924
Tell me, Jill, why does he do it?

79
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,671
He likes to win.

80
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,343
Why do you do it?

81
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,169
He pays me.

82
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,257
Is that all he pays you for?

83
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,432
And for being seen with him.

84
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,683
-Just seen?
-Just seen.

85
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,183
I'm so glad.

86
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,308
You're much too nice

87
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,397
to be mixed up in anything like this,
you know.

88
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,446
Now hear this, Goldfinger.

89
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,741
Your luck has just changed.

90
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,695
I doubt very much if
the Miami Beach police

91
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,405
would take kindly to what you're doing.

92
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,121
Nod your head if you agree.

93
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,745
Nod!

94
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,497
Good. Now start losing, Goldfinger.

95
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,049
Shall we say, $10,000?

96
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,854
No, let's be generous. Let's make it 15,000.

97
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,727
May I see?

98
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,396
Well, I can see this is really my day.

99
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,400
Gin.

100
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,655
Over and out.

101
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,542
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.

102
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,746
I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Bond.

103
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,166
Call me James.

104
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,930
More than anyone I've met
in a long time, James.

105
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,889
What on earth
are we going to do about it?

106
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,511
Yes, what?

107
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,268
-I'll tell you at dinner.
-Where?

108
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,388
I know the best place in town.

109
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,831
Station W.E.B.S. brings you
the latest in world news.

110
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,209
Washington.
At the White House this afternoon,

111
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,337
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...

112
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,144
That makes two of us.

113
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,809
-Hello.
-Leiter here.

114
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,648
-Felix.
-Well, now?

115
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,029
What's that? Dinner?

116
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,570
No. Look, I'm sorry. I can't.

117
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,066
Something big's come up.

118
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,367
Right...

119
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,998
-How about breakfast?
-Okay.

120
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,249
-Not too early.
-I'll call you around 9:00.

121
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,922
Yes, 9:00 will be fine.

122
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,961
-So long, James.
-Good night, Felix.

123
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,556
It's lost its chill.

124
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,770
Why, you...

125
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,515
It's all right, there's another in the fridge.

126
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,648
Who needs it?

127
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,284
My dear girl, there are some things
that just aren't done,

128
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,161
such as drinking Dom Perignon '53

129
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,449
above a temperature of
38 degrees Fahrenheit.

130
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,704
That's as bad as listening to
the Beatles without earmuffs.

131
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,214
Now, where is this passion juice?

132
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,752
Jill?

133
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,785
Yes, Mr. Bond?

134
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,094
Beach 79432, room 119.

135
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,635
Hello?

136
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,260
Hello, Felix? Get over here right away.

137
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,271
-What's up?
-The girl's dead.

138
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,520
Dink?

139
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,731
No. Masterson, Jill Masterson,

140
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,109
and she's covered in paint.

141
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,729
Gold paint.

142
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,120
Gold? All over?

143
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,405
She died of skin suffocation.

144
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,998
It's been known to happen
to cabaret dancers.

145
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,254
It's all right
so long as you leave a small bare patch

146
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,006
at the base of the spine
to allow the skin to breathe.

147
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,589
Someone obviously didn't.

148
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,264
And I know who.

149
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,102
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

150
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,640
It's an assignment, like any other

151
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,267
and if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

152
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,355
008 can replace you.

153
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,783
You've hardly distinguished yourself,
have you?

154
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,072
You were supposed to observe
Mr. Goldfinger, not borrow his girlfriend.

155
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,067
Instead of that,
Goldfinger goes off to Europe,

156
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,489
and it's only by the grace of God,
your friend Leiter,

157
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,788
and my intervention with
the British embassy in Washington,

158
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,212
that you're not in the custody
of the Miami Beach police.

159
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,921
Sir, I'm aware of my shortcomings,

160
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,382
but I'm prepared to
continue this assignment

161
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,803
in the spirit you suggest,

162
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,012
if I knew what it was about.

163
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,339
Sir.

164
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,558
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

165
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,225
I know it when I see it.

166
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,651
Meet me here at 7:00. Black tie.

167
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,987
Now, what do you know
about gold, Moneypenny?

168
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,825
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

169
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,291
You know,
on the third finger of your left hand.

170
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,422
One of these days
we really must look into that.

171
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
What about tonight?

172
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,754
You'll come around for dinner,

173
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,457
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

174
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,088
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,

175
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,594
but unfortunately I do have
a business appointment.

176
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,223
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me.

177
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,386
Some girls have all the luck.

178
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,476
Who is she, James?

179
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,731
She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

180
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,402
and kindly omit the
customary by-play with 007.

181
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,942
He's dining with me,
and I don't want him to be late.

182
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,204
So there's hope for me yet.

183
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,201
Moneypenny, won't you ever believe me?

184
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,211
We here at the Bank of England, Mr. Bond,

185
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,830
are the official depository for gold bullion

186
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,207
just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.

187
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,046
We know, of course,
the amounts we each hold,

188
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,171
we know the amounts
deposited in other banks,

189
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,138
and we can estimate
what is being held for industrial purposes.

190
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,719
This enables the two governments
to establish, respectively,

191
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,055
the true value of the dollar and the pound.

192
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,141
Consequently, we are vitally concerned
with unauthorized leakages.

193
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,398
I take it you mean smuggling?

194
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,650
Yes.

195
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,067
Gold, gentlemen,
which can be melted down and recast,

196
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,823
is virtually untraceable,

197
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,815
which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

198
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,328
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

199
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,160
Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.

200
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,785
Thank you, sir.

201
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,745
Have a little more of this
rather disappointing brandy.

202
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,134
What's the matter with it?

203
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,340
I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine
indifferently blended, sir...

204
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,427
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

205
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,429
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.

206
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,394
Gentlemen, Mr. Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

207
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,136
in Zurich, Amsterdam,
Caracas, and Hong Kong.

208
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,438
Worth 20 million pounds.
Most of it came from this country.

209
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,903
Why move it?

210
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,113
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country.

211
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,654
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,

212
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,857
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

213
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,239
and triple your money.

214
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,365
Providing, of course, you have
the facilities for melting it down.

215
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,503
And has he?

216
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,909
Apart from being
a legitimate bullion dealer,

217
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,917
Mr. Goldfinger poses...

218
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
No, that's not quite fair.

219
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,916
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweler.

220
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,466
He's legally entitled

221
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,639
to operate modest
metallurgical installations.

222
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,509
His British one is down in Kent.

223
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,466
As yet, we have failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.

224
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,388
And Lord knows we've tried.

225
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:55,056
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,

226
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,727
then the bank could institute proceedings

227
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,316
to recover the bulk of his holdings.

228
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:01,321
I think it's time Mr. Goldfinger and I met.

229
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,904
Socially, of course.

230
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,409
I was hoping you'd say that.

231
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,990
It might lead to a business talk,

232
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,827
Mr. Goldfinger's kind of business.

233
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,202
I'll need some sort of bait.

234
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,458
I quite agree. This is the only one we have

235
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,291
from the Nazi hoard
at the bottom of Lake Toplitz

236
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,836
in the Salzkammergut.

237
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,209
But there are undoubtedly others.

238
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,049
Mr. Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit,

239
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,014
providing he returns it, of course.

240
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,604
It's worth Â£5,000.

241
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,975
You'll draw it from Q branch with
the rest of your equipment in the morning.

242
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,402
Of course, sir.

243
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:52,829
Morning, Q.

244
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,543
Good morning, 007. This way, please.

245
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,879
My, we are busy this morning.

246
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,592
It's not perfected yet.

247
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:10,389
-Where's my Bentley?
-It's had its day, I'm afraid.

248
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,393
-But it's never let me down.
-M's orders, 007.

249
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,938
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5,
with modifications.

250
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,984
Now, pay attention, please.

251
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,234
Windscreen, bulletproof.

252
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,819
As are the side and the rear windows.

253
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,067
Revolving number plates, naturally.

254
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,198
Valid all countries.

255
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,584
Here's a nice little
transmitting device called a homer.

256
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,374
You prime it by pressing
that back like this.

257
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,959
You see? The smaller model
is now standard field issue,

258
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,376
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

259
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,505
Its larger brother is magnetic.

260
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,590
Right.

261
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,677
To be concealed in the car you're trailing

262
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,013
while you keep out of sight.

263
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,726
Reception on the dashboard here.

264
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,647
Auto-visual. Range, 150 miles.

265
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,193
Ingenious. And useful, too.

266
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,317
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

267
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,275
It has not been perfected
after years of patient research

268
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,617
entirely for that purpose, 007.

269
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,707
And incidentally,
we'd appreciate its return,

270
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,870
along with all your other equipment,

271
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,669
intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

272
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,803
You'd be surprised

273
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,589
the amount of wear and tear
that goes on out there in the field.

274
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,715
Anything else?

275
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,681
I won't keep you
for more than an hour or so,

276
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,681
if you give me your undivided attention.

277
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,023
We've installed some
rather interesting modifications.

278
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,772
You see this arm here?

279
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,398
Now, open the top, and inside are
your defense mechanism controls.

280
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,742
Smoke screen, oil slick,
rear bulletproof screen,

281
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,660
and left and right
front-wing machine guns.

282
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,069
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.

283
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,739
You see the gear lever here?

284
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,487
Now, if you take the top off,

285
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,829
you'll find a little red button.

286
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,956
Whatever you do, don't touch it.

287
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,132
And why not?

288
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,500
'Cause you'll release
this section of the roof

289
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:08,878
and engage and then fire
the passenger ejector seat.

290
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,257
Ejector seat? You're joking.

291
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,469
I never joke about my work, 007.

292
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,353
Ready, Blacking?

293
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,728
Yes, sir.
There's an old member dropped by, sir.

294
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,066
Same handicap as yours,
I wondered if you'd rather play with him.

295
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,363
Where is he?

296
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,946
-Mr. Bond?
-Yes?

297
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,318
This is Mr. Goldfinger.

298
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,955
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

299
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,083
You can go straight off,
the first tee is clear.

300
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,629
-Fine.
-I'll get Hawker to carry for you, Mr. Bond.

301
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,763
That'll be splendid.

302
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,169
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

303
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,676
I'll take some tees.

304
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,181
Yes, of course.

305
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,731
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr. Bond.

306
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,270
He's an admirable manservant, but mute.

307
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,225
He's not a very good caddie.

308
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,895
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea, hey?

309
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,500
This meeting is not a coincidence, hmm?

310
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,415
What's your game, Mr. Bond?

311
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,177
My game?

312
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,263
You didn't come here to play golf.

313
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:00,616
The 1940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

314
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:01,953
Part of a smelt of 600.

315
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,707
They vanished in 1944.

316
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,709
When the Nazis were on the run.

317
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,171
And you have access to more?

318
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,341
Yes, from the same source.

319
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,840
Interesting.

320
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,302
-Two holes to go.
-Yes, and all square.

321
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,592
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

322
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,598
No, what do you have in mind?

323
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,560
The bar of gold
you have with you, naturally.

324
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,559
It's worth Â£5,000.

325
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,064
I'll stake the cash equivalent.

326
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,232
Naturally.

327
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,993
Strict rules of golf?

328
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,532
But of course.

329
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,282
Bad luck. You're in the rough.

330
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,753
What a pity. Here it is.

331
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,631
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

332
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,246
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.

333
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,588
Five minutes are almost up.

334
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,762
A lost ball will cost you
a stroke and distance.

335
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,652
I'm still training him as a caddie.

336
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,158
Successfully, too.

337
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,985
-Slazenger Number 1?
-Good.

338
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:11,245
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

339
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,833
It isn't.

340
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,128
-How do you know?
-I'm standing on it.

341
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,051
Why, you crafty old...

342
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,592
Leave it.

343
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,471
The ball you found, sir?

344
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,345
Yes, Slazenger 7.

345
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,478
Let's have a little fun with Mr. Goldfinger.

346
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,608
Would you like me
to mark it or knock it in?

347
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,982
Play it.

348
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,864
-This for a half.
-That's right.

349
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,959
One to go. That'll be the clincher.

350
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,127
Fine.

351
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,881
Did you switch them, sir?

352
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,143
Then we've got him.

353
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,561
If he doesn't notice the switch.

354
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,305
-It's your honor, sir!
-It's all right.

355
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,179
Down in five.

356
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,179
I have to sink this
to halve the game, right?

357
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,888
You win, Goldfinger.

358
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,187
It seems I'm too good for you.

359
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,324
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

360
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,491
-Yes, why?
-This is a Slazenger 7.

361
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,571
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

362
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,702
You must have played the wrong ball
somewhere on the 18th fairway.

363
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,535
We are playing strict rules,

364
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,460
so I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.

365
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,787
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

366
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,122
You are a clever,
resourceful man, Mr. Bond.

367
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,208
Why, thank you.

368
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,923
Perhaps too clever.
Twice our paths have crossed,

369
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,674
let's leave it at that.

370
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,415
I should think our first meeting
would have convinced you.

371
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:07,798
I see.

372
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,354
You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

373
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,757
Both of us know perfectly well

374
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,889
what we're talking about, Mr. Bond.

375
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,386
But I see that
it is necessary to remind you.

376
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,728
Oddjob!

377
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,937
Many people have tried
to involve themselves

378
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,186
in my affairs, unsuccessfully.

379
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,381
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

380
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,463
Nothing, Mr. Bond.

381
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,048
I own the club.

382
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:53,177
I assume you want
the check made out to cash?

383
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,813
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

384
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,192
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

385
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,402
I believe this is yours.

386
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,227
May I have your attention, please?

387
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:48,074
British United Air Ferries
announcing final call

388
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,991
for the departure of their
DS-400 flight to Geneva.

389
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,410
British United Air Ferries
announce the departure

390
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:05,208
of their DS-400 flight to Geneva.

391
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,293
Mr. Bond?

392
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,498
That's all right, I've got you booked out

393
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,707
on the next flight to Geneva
leaving in half an hour.

394
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,128
-Thank you very much.
-Right, sir.

395
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,917
Discipline, 007.

396
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,383
Discipline.

397
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,944
Are you all right?

398
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,189
Here, let me help you.
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

399
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,692
No thanks to you.

400
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,944
You should have pulled over further.

401
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,239
Look at them!

402
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,821
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.

403
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,777
How could new tires...

404
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,157
Defect of some kind, most likely.

405
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,664
Anyway, I'm so glad
it's only the car and not you.

406
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,667
You don't look like the sort of girl
who should be ditched.

407
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,289
Never mind that.
Please take me to the nearest garage.

408
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:19,167
Certainly. By the way, my name is Bond...

409
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,665
As quickly as possible.

410
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,558
-I'll take that.
-Yes, of course.

411
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,897
What's your name, by the way?

412
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,816
Soames. Tilly Soames.

413
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,744
Here for the hunting season?

414
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,908
I had a case just like that one.

415
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,710
It's for my ice skates.

416
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,094
Lovely sport.

417
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,423
-Where do you skate?
-St. Moritz.

418
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,142
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.

419
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,260
There's a garage.

420
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,276
I've had an accident.

421
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,082
How long will it take? Thank you.

422
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,512
They say it will take
24 hours to get new tires.

423
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,671
There's a hotel nearby.

424
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:46,879
Jump in. I'll run you down.

425
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,888
That won't be necessary.

426
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,644
I hate to leave you here alone.

427
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,563
I can take care of myself.

428
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,561
Yes, I'm sure you can.

429
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,982
Well, don't forget to write.

430
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,508
Smuggling is an art, Mr. Ling.

431
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,349
And art requires...

432
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,601
In this case,
the bodywork of my Rolls Royce

433
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,308
is 18-carat gold.

434
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,108
We dismantle it here,

435
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,954
reduce the gold in
this special furnace to ingots,

436
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,780
which in turn will be released on the board
and weigh approximately two tons.

437
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,576
I make six trips a year to the continent

438
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,463
in the Rolls Royce, Mr. Ling.

439
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,460
It would be wiser
to suspend your other activities.

440
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,463
Now, Mr. Ling,
please assure your principals

441
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,415
Operation Grand Slam will have
my undivided attention.

442
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,296
Now, there are certain matters
we must discuss.

443
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,493
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

444
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,569
What the hell are you doing here?

445
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,986
I want to kill him!

446
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,704
-Kill who?
-Goldfinger.

447
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,784
I want him alive.

448
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,618
I want him dead. He killed my sister.

449
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:45,655
T.M. Tilly Masterson.

450
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,415
I knew your sister, Jill.

451
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,540
I know what he did to her in Miami.

452
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,536
No, you don't. Let me go!

453
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,458
If you wanted to kill him,
why did you shoot at me?

454
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,207
I didn't. I was shooting at him.

455
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,799
You're a lousy shot.

456
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,586
Somebody else around here isn't.
Come on.

457
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:11,113
Quick. Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

458
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,273
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

459
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,203
Now!

460
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,781
Good evening, 007.

461
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:32,203
My name is James Bond.

462
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,778
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.

463
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,326
You have been recognized,

464
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,539
let's say, by one of
your opposite numbers,

465
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,584
who is also licensed to kill.

466
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,918
That interesting car of yours!

467
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,626
I, too, have a new toy,

468
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,797
but considerably more practical.

469
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,215
You are looking at an industrial laser

470
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,724
which emits an extraordinary light
not to be found in nature.

471
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,228
It can project a spot on the moon,

472
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,613
or at closer range cut through solid metal.

473
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,150
I will show you.

474
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:38,302
This is gold, Mr. Bond.

475
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,595
All my life, I've been in love with its color,

476
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,353
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

477
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:50,024
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock.

478
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,185
Which is considerable.

479
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:59,446
I think you've made your point, Goldfinger.
Thank you for the demonstration.

480
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,123
Choose your next
witticism carefully, Mr. Bond.

481
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,953
It may be your last.

482
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,877
The purpose of
our two previous encounters

483
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,289
is now very clear to me.

484
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,127
I do not intend
to be distracted by another.

485
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,883
Good night, Mr. Bond.

486
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,473
Do you expect me to talk?

487
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,642
No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.

488
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,222
There is nothing you can talk to me about

489
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,267
that I don't already know.

490
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,815
You're forgetting one thing.

491
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,488
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

492
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,746
I trust he will be more successful.

493
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,003
But he knows what I know.

494
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:55,087
You know nothing, Mr. Bond.

495
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,723
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

496
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,989
Two words you may have overheard,

497
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:29,038
which cannot possibly have
any significance to you

498
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,463
or anyone in your organization.

499
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,962
Can you afford to take that chance?

500
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,938
You are quite right, Mr. Bond.

501
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,310
You are worth more to me alive.

502
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,018
Who are you?

503
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,520
My name is Pussy Galore.

504
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,271
I must be dreaming.

505
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,871
I thought I'd wake up dead.

506
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,503
Tranquilizer gun. Knock-out shot.

507
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,750
I see.

508
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:58,246
I'm delighted to be here.

509
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,719
And by the way, where is here?

510
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,931
35,000 feet,
flying southwest over Newfoundland.

511
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,638
That explains the humming.

512
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,814
The humming means
you're in Mr. Goldfinger's

513
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:15,193
Lockheed Jetstar heading for Baltimore,

514
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,650
and you're his guest.

515
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,060
I'm honored.

516
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,570
I never realized he enjoyed
my company that much.

517
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,526
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

518
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,113
Mei-lei.

519
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,582
Can I do something for you, Mr. Bond?

520
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,445
Just a drink. A martini.

521
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,328
Shaken, not stirred.

522
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,459
-Won't you join me?
-Not on duty.

523
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,045
I'm Mr. Goldfinger's personal pilot.

524
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,508
You are?

525
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,931
And just how personal is that?

526
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,715
I'm a damned good pilot. Period.

527
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,347
Well, that's good news.

528
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:55,604
By the way, where is our host?

529
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,306
He flew on ahead.

530
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,731
Thank you.

531
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:10,622
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

532
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,919
This should be a memorable flight.

533
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,665
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.

534
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,555
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

535
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,306
our port of entry into the United States,

536
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,978
in 55 minutes.

537
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:49,488
Mei-Lei, I would
like to arrive more appropriately dressed.

538
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,413
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

539
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,328
And my attachÃ© case?

540
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,541
Black attachÃ© case damaged
when examined.

541
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:00,875
So sorry.

542
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,250
Apology is quite unnecessary.

543
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:13,184
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

544
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,858
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

545
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,776
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

546
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,530
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

547
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:01,118
Now, Pussy, you know
a lot more about planes than guns.

548
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,365
That's a Smith and Wesson .45,

549
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,077
and if you fired at this close range,

550
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,207
the bullet will pass through me
and the fuselage

551
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,424
like a blowtorch through butter.

552
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,634
The cabin will depressurize,

553
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,764
and we'll both be sucked
into outer space together.

554
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,392
But if that's how you want to enter
the United States, you're welcome.

555
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,760
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

556
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:19,967
That's very sensible.

557
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,137
Besides, there's always
so much going on around Mr. Goldfinger.

558
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:26,807
I wouldn't dream
of not accepting his hospitality.

559
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,774
He'll be glad to see you, too.

560
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,939
You like close shaves, don't you?

561
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,621
Washington, sir, on the green scrambler.

562
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,582
-M here.
-Leiter, sir.

563
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:44,624
Leiter!

564
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,996
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal.

565
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,285
It's monitored into
Friendship Airport, Baltimore,

566
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:51,379
where he's just landed.

567
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,923
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

568
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,757
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

569
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,182
He came in on a private jet, ex-Geneva,

570
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,642
registered to our old friend,
Auric Goldfinger.

571
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,022
-I'm glad he's making progress.
-Yes, sir.

572
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,390
Keep an eye on him for us.

573
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,596
Their flight plan gives Blue Grass Field,
Kentucky, as their final destination.

574
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,398
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?

575
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:12,072
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

576
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:37,215
-Mr. Bond, please.
-Of course.

577
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,930
Any time.

578
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,102
Thank you.

579
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,740
Do mind your step, Captain.

580
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,951
Just keep playing it easy.

581
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,696
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr. Goldfinger?

582
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,077
-Of course.
-And I'll see the supplies are here soon.

583
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:28,639
Talented chaps.

584
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,057
They should be. I trained them.

585
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:32,942
Come on.

586
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,363
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

587
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,822
I believe that the bourbon
and branch water's rather splendid

588
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,533
here in Kentucky.

589
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,783
Well, now that
we're both off duty, perhaps...

590
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:50,706
Manners, Oddjob.

591
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:53,791
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.

592
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,669
You know, he kills little girls like you.

593
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,416
Little boys, too.

594
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,425
-Well?
-Dress rehearsal

595
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:47,813
went like a dream, Skipper.

596
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,139
Good. You'll get your final briefing tonight.

597
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,135
That'll be all for now.

598
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:25,257
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr. Bond.

599
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,012
Lovely animal, isn't she?

600
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,847
Certainly better bred than the owner.

601
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,562
Show Mr. Bond to his quarters, please.

602
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,291
Felix?

603
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,537
Maybe we should just drop in on him.

604
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:42,798
He'll shout if he needs us.

605
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,046
They're all here, Mr. Goldfinger.

606
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,637
Yes. Yes.

607
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,183
Thank you, Kisch.

608
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,778
That guy Solo's going to wear
a hole in his shoes.

609
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,490
I like this!

610
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,078
-Wait!
-Gentlemen!

611
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,245
Goldfinger,

612
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,923
why weren't we told that New York
and the West Coast were in on this?

613
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:24,423
Look who's talking.

614
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,804
I do not do business with Chicago.

615
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,471
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.

616
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,091
Now I find I'm attending
a hood's convention.

617
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,598
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

618
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,142
I made a delivery, too.

619
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,765
You all made the deliveries
we contracted for.

620
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:42,353
And you owe me one million bucks.

621
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:47,318
I owe each of you a million in gold bullion.

622
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:49,742
So pay!

623
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:53,163
Gentlemen, you can have
the million today...

624
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,750
Or 10 millions tomorrow.

625
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,044
Did you say 10 million?

626
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,668
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

627
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,841
Banks don't open on Sunday.

628
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,053
My bank will.

629
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,719
What's with that trick pool table?

630
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,823
Cover him!

631
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,241
Cover those doors!

632
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,610
Turn those lights back on!

633
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,407
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

634
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,082
There's no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

635
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:44,498
I don't like being cooped up like this.

636
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,004
What's that map doing there?

637
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,260
This is my bank,

638
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,597
the gold depository
at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

639
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:06,106
In its vaults are $15 billion,

640
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:11,782
the entire gold supply
of the United States.

641
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,950
Knock off Fort Knox?

642
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,279
-Got a key or something?
-Of a kind.

643
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:23,291
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

644
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,540
41,000.

645
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:28,785
And who's going to
say boo to them, Goldfinger?

646
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,588
-Hey, what's going on here?
-Hey, what is this?

647
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:31,962
The floor!

648
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,303
What is this, a merry-go-round?

649
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:57,493
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

650
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,243
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

651
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,867
He has fired rockets to the moon,

652
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,115
split the atom,

653
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:09,166
achieved miracles
in every field of human endeavor

654
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,004
except crime!

655
01:10:16,296 --> 01:10:19,206
The underworld will rock
with applause for centuries.

656
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,429
-Cut the commercial.
-Yeah, get to the point.

657
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:22,719
You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.

658
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,392
The depository is impregnable.

659
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,510
Look, the joint is bombproof,
electrified, lousy with...

660
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,099
Bear with me, please!

661
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,063
Fort Knox is a bank, like any other.

662
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,895
Larger, better-protected perhaps,

663
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,230
but, nonetheless, a bank.

664
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:39,736
It can be, I think the expression is, blown.

665
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,776
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen.

666
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,575
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

667
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,828
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

668
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,960
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

669
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,382
Every eventuality has been considered.

670
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:59,131
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

671
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,795
Your organization, Mr. Midnight,
brought the consignment

672
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,843
of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

673
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,258
They contain Delta 9.

674
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:08,467
-Delta 9?
-What's that?

675
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:13,306
An invisible nerve gas
which disperses 15 minutes

676
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:19,574
after inducing complete
unconsciousness for 24 hours.

677
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,951
Tomorrow at dawn,

678
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,780
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

679
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,697
will spray it into the atmosphere.

680
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:37,245
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilized,

681
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,745
my task force,

682
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,456
which Mr. Strap had his people

683
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,046
smuggle across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,

684
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,142
will approach Fort Knox
in motorized equipment

685
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,680
along Bullion Boulevard

686
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,223
which runs past the depository here,

687
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,886
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

688
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,984
This fence surrounding the depository,

689
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,364
as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.

690
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,779
It will be dynamited.

691
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,657
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

692
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,160
How, may I ask?

693
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,203
You made that possible, Mr. Solo,

694
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,286
by arranging through your
considerable influence in shipping circles

695
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:17,173
to bring through customs uninspected

696
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,420
a consignment labeled "machine parts."

697
01:12:20,628 --> 01:12:23,418
All that will then remain is
to descend to the vaults,

698
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:25,216
where the bullion is stored.

699
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,759
-I've heard enough.
-Let him finish.

700
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:30,973
If you have no objection,
I'll take my money now.

701
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,305
What's the matter, Solo,
too big for you to handle?

702
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,441
Gentlemen, we must respect
Mr. Solo's decision.

703
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:47,357
Please excuse me for a few minutes
while I take care of him.

704
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,567
Make yourselves comfortable.

705
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,630
-How do we get it out?
-That's the bit I want to hear.

706
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:24,444
Pussy.

707
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,435
Who taught you judo?

708
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,490
The gun you took.

709
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,083
The gun.

710
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:36,704
The gun, of course.

711
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:49,844
We must have a few fast falls
together sometime.

712
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,444
Hey, Strap, if he's got the right answers,

713
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,449
you and me don't even have to be there.

714
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,411
The boys can handle everything.

715
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,958
Hey, they closed up the fireplace.

716
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,251
What's going on?

717
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,634
-I don't like this.
-What the...

718
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,290
What's going on here?

719
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:32,554
The gas!

720
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,661
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr. Solo.

721
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,076
However...

722
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,752
Mr. Bond, I thought you were resting
in your quarters.

723
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:13,509
They are delightful,
but it's much too nice to stay indoors.

724
01:15:13,593 --> 01:15:17,263
I ran into Miss Galore,
and she suggested that we join you.

725
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,512
Mr. Solo, Mr. Bond,

726
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,559
-another of my distinguished guests.
-Hello.

727
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,392
Leaving us so soon, Mr. Solo?

728
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,397
Unfortunately,
he has a pressing engagement.

729
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,149
Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

730
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,192
Boy!

731
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,815
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

732
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:33,492
My plane will get you
to New York on time...

733
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,411
With your excess luggage.

734
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:37,949
Allow me.

735
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,325
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.

736
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:43,962
You'll be at the airport in a few minutes.

737
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,750
Goodbye, Mr. Solo.
Some other time, perhaps.

738
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,634
Happy landings, old boy.

739
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,886
I found him under the model.

740
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,431
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

741
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:07,976
So did I.

742
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,785
He's on the move!

743
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:54,283
Slow down. Don't crowd him.

744
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,047
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn.

745
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,754
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.

746
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,849
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

747
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,771
Ten will get you one,
it's a drink or a dame.

748
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,395
-Dead.
-Mechanical failure, maybe.

749
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,693
-Unless he switched it off.
-Why would he do that?

750
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,448
Drive to the farm. It's all we can do.

751
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,702
Right.

752
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:41,843
Thank you.

753
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:42,337
Thank you.

754
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,758
Your share of Operation Grand Slam

755
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,592
will make you a very rich woman, my dear.

756
01:20:49,929 --> 01:20:52,719
Why else would I be in it, Mr. Goldfinger?

757
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:56,182
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

758
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,228
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

759
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,940
I'll hang up a sign, "No trespassing,"

760
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,978
and go back to nature.

761
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,696
Yes, Kisch?

762
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,531
Two men in a car with binoculars.

763
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,827
Touts looking for racing tips.

764
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,999
There's another possibility, however.

765
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,995
Kisch, ask Mr. Bond to join us.

766
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:25,547
We were quite right to spare
Mr. Bond's life in Switzerland

767
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,801
if those gentlemen are his friends.

768
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,723
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

769
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,716
For their benefit, Pussy,

770
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,306
let's make him as happy as possible.

771
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:40,396
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

772
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:42,435
Certainly.

773
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,983
Business before pleasure.

774
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,378
He wants you.

775
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:19,431
Mr. Bond. Sit down, please. Mint julep?

776
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:22,597
-Traditional, but satisfying.
-Yes, thanks.

777
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,188
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

778
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,694
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

779
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,197
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

780
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,201
And incidentally, Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

781
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:39,537
You are unusually well-informed,
Mr. Bond.

782
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:42,082
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

783
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,669
American motorists kill
that many every two years.

784
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:49,418
Yes, I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

785
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:55,426
$15 billion
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

786
01:22:55,512 --> 01:23:00,482
60 men would take
12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.

787
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,096
Now, at the most,
you're gonna have two hours

788
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,687
before the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marines move in

789
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:07,823
and make you put it back.

790
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,190
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

791
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:17,279
The julep tart enough for you?

792
01:23:17,368 --> 01:23:20,328
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank,

793
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:23,078
but not to steal anything?

794
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,871
Why?

795
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,285
Go on, Mr. Bond.

796
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,168
Mr. Ling,
the red Chinese agent at the factory,

797
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,795
he's a specialist in nuclear fission.

798
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,844
But of course!

799
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,101
His government's given you a bomb.

800
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,102
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

801
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,564
It's small, but particularly dirty.

802
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,520
Cobalt and iodine?

803
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:47,895
Precisely.

804
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,691
If you explode it in Fort Knox,

805
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:56,065
the entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for

806
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,531
57 years.

807
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,487
58, to be exact.

808
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:05,212
I apologize, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.

809
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,630
They get what they want,
economic chaos in the West,

810
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:11,916
and the value of your gold
increases many times.

811
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,375
I conservatively estimate 10 times.

812
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,389
Brilliant.

813
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,929
But the atomic device, as you call it,

814
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,635
is already obviously in this country.

815
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,349
Obviously.

816
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,984
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

817
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,193
could be risky, very risky.

818
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:37,198
On the contrary, Mr. Bond,
the risk is all on your side.

819
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,870
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,

820
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:43,081
who knows where it might
be exploded, eh?

821
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:46,082
Perhaps the Polaris
submarine pens at New London,

822
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:49,378
Cape Kennedy,

823
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,252
near the White House.

824
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:55,506
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

825
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:58,091
You will be there to see for yourself.

826
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:00,467
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

827
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,984
Forgive me, Mr. Bond,
but I must arrange to separate my gold

828
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,938
from the late Mr. Solo.

829
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,696
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

830
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,697
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?

831
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,747
Please entertain Mr. Bond for me, Pussy.

832
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,000
I'll join you both later.

833
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,876
Well, how about it, handsome?

834
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:40,125
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

835
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,049
Well, the new Miss Galore.

836
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,887
Where do you hide
your gold knuckles in this outfit?

837
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,023
I never carry weapons
after business hours.

838
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:51,022
Yeah? So you're off duty.

839
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,114
I'm completely defenseless.

840
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,357
So am I.

841
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,581
That's my James.

842
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,540
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

843
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,080
Yes. I'm glad you're enjoying it.

844
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,578
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

845
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,296
He's quite mad, you know.

846
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,593
Well, now, what do we have here?

847
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,598
007 seems to have
the situation well in hand.

848
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,978
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

849
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:30,688
You're quite a girl, Pussy.

850
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,979
I'm strictly the outdoor type.

851
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,358
I'd like to think you're
not in all of this caper.

852
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,490
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

853
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:43,277
What would it take for you
to see things my way?

854
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,624
A lot more than you've got.

855
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,371
-How do you know?
-I don't want to know.

856
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:52,705
Isn't it customary

857
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,381
to grant a condemned man
his last request?

858
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,340
You've asked for this.

859
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,469
Get up.

860
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,557
Certainly.

861
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,080
There. Now, let's both play.

862
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,436
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

863
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,194
Commence Rock-a-bye Baby.

864
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,566
Good luck.

865
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,801
Speed, 220.

866
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,835
Wind check, westerly.

867
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:43,525
Champagne leader to Champagne section.

868
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,240
Commence dive now.

869
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,504
Ready for Rock-a-bye Baby.

870
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,665
Commence spray on countdown.

871
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,501
Five,

872
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,415
four, three, two,

873
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,087
zero.

874
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:52,613
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.

875
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,947
The baby is asleep.

876
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,779
I repeat, the baby is asleep.

877
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,198
We're going home now. Out.

878
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,351
Chafoo.

879
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:29,139
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

880
01:35:29,224 --> 01:35:31,934
For once, you're exactly where I want you.

881
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:42,300
-The bomb's here.
-Let's get moving, brigadier.

882
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,460
Right, Jack. Move in.

883
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,588
Move in, commando tactics.

884
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:49,014
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

885
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,715
-Minimum offensive fire...
-Come on.

886
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,135
...until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

887
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,643
Bomb disposal unit to accompany dog.

888
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:31,888
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

889
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:08,631
Mr. Ling, it is merely a matter of timing...

890
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:36,987
Goldfinger!

891
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,246
Please, Mr. Gold...

892
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,131
He's one of them! So's the girl! I'll get her!

893
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,960
You get the door open!

894
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:03,731
We're trapped. The bomb.
I'll take the fuse out.

895
01:39:05,523 --> 01:39:07,073
Don't be a fool.

896
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,230
You can be a hero. I'm not!

897
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:14,494
No! No!

898
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,805
Come on, you boys! Get going! Hurry up!

899
01:44:58,084 --> 01:44:59,544
What kept you?

900
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:03,092
You okay, James?
Where's your butler friend?

901
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,755
He blew a fuse.

902
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:09,141
Three more ticks and
Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot.

903
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,300
Did you get him?

904
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:12,718
-Not yet, but he won't get far.
-And Pussy?

905
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,807
She helped us
switch the gas in the canisters.

906
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:17,602
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

907
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:22,901
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

908
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:34,123
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.

909
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:36,873
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?

910
01:45:36,956 --> 01:45:39,456
The President wants
to thank you personally.

911
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:41,082
It was nothing, really.

912
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,288
I know that, but he doesn't.

913
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:46,255
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here?

914
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,380
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

915
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:49,507
Who are the other two?

916
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,093
There are no other two.

917
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,298
-Goodbye, Felix.
-So long, James. Good luck.

918
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:55,179
-Thank you, brigadier.
-Good luck.

919
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:29,971
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr. Bond.

920
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:33,601
Congratulations on your promotion,
Goldfinger.

921
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:36,506
Are you having lunch
at the White House, too?

922
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:39,229
In two hours, I shall be in Cuba.

923
01:46:39,977 --> 01:46:43,727
And you have interfered
with my plans for the last time, Mr. Bond.

924
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:46,146
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.

925
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,653
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

926
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:50,445
By the way, where is she?

927
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:52,359
I will deal with her later.

928
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:55,658
At the moment, she is
where she ought to be. At the controls.

929
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:43,408
Pussy.

930
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,540
What happened? Where's Goldfinger?

931
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,287
Playing his golden harp.

932
01:47:51,257 --> 01:47:52,377
It's no good!

933
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:28,665
No, you don't.

934
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:33,421
This is no time to be rescued.
