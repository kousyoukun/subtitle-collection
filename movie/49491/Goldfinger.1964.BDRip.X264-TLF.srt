1
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,589
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,057
Mr. Ramirez and his friends
will be out of business.

3
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:13,292
He won't be using heroin-flavored
bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,969
Don't go back to your hotel.
They'll be watching you.

5
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,032
A plane leaves for Miami in an hour.

6
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:22,834
I'll be on it...

7
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:25,943
...but first I have some
unfinished business to attend to.

8
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,323
Forgive me.

9
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,524
Why do you always wear that thing?

10
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:52,967
I have a slight inferiority complex.

11
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:55,197
Where was I? Oh, yes.

12
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,796
Shocking.

13
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,160
Positively shocking.

14
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:00,535
- How's this?
- That's nice. Very nice.

15
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,773
- Just here?
- A little lower, darling.

16
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,114
I thought I'd find you
in good hands.

17
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:10,955
Felix! How are you?

18
00:09:11,157 --> 00:09:13,091
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello.

19
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,089
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

20
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:19,163
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.
Man-talk.

21
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:25,836
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

22
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:29,031
They got closer to you in Jamaica,
didn't they? What's on your mind?

23
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,870
- I'm on holiday.
- Not anymore. Signal from London.

24
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:36,242
I knew M wouldn't book me into the best
hotel in Miami Beach out of gratitude.

25
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:38,576
He asked us to keep an eye
on him for you.

26
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:42,209
Auric Goldfinger.
Sounds like a French nail varnish.

27
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,412
He's British
but he doesn't sound like it.

28
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,559
Big operator. Worldwide interests,
all apparently reputable.

29
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,887
Owns one of the finest stud farms
in the States.

30
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:53,657
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean as far as CIA's concerned.

31
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,731
Where do I find him?

32
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,475
That's his pigeon waiting for him.

33
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,446
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners every day for a week.

34
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,376
Morning, Mr. Simmons.
Ready for our game?

35
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:18,216
Sure I am. When you're 10 grand in
the hole, you're ready for anything.

36
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:22,326
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!

37
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:24,588
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

38
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:27,163
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

39
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:30,030
Five dollars a point.

40
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,868
- Did you say five?
- My luck's got to change.

41
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,306
Okay.

42
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,171
I'll get back to the office
and cable M you're on the job.

43
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,281
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- I'll call you later.

44
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,034
- Four.
- So soon?

45
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,635
How many?

46
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,136
Seven, 12, 18, 32...

47
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,441
...44.

48
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,951
Miss?

49
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,883
What are you...?

50
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,684
That's Mr. Goldfinger's suite!

51
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,884
Yes, I know.

52
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,258
You're very sweet.

53
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:41,639
He just drew the king of clubs.
That makes his count 59.

54
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:46,709
He's got a diamond run.
Eight, nine, 10.

55
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,872
He's holding on to the six of spades.
I guess he thinks you want it.

56
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,213
That last draw
was the eight of hearts.

57
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,648
He needs kings and queens.

58
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,091
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

59
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:16,374
Come on, come on.

60
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,877
That's more like it.

61
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,907
- What's your name?
- Jill.

62
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,607
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

63
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:32,248
- Tell me, Jill, why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

64
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,123
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

65
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:40,056
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

66
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:44,361
- Just seen?
- Just seen.

67
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:46,929
I'm so glad.

68
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:53,469
You're much too nice to be mixed up
in anything like this.

69
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:02,912
Now hear this, Goldfinger.
Your luck has just changed.

70
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:05,989
I doubt if the Miami Beach police
would take kindly...

71
00:13:06,158 --> 00:13:08,023
...to what you're doing.

72
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,429
Nod your head if you agree.

73
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:13,625
Nod.

74
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,896
Good. Now start losing, Goldfinger.

75
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,766
Shall we say $ 10,000?

76
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:24,568
Let's be generous.
Let's make it $ 15,000.

77
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,377
May I see?

78
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:40,624
I can see this is really my day. Gin.

79
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:49,627
Over and out.

80
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,036
That should keep him occupied
for some time.

81
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,366
I'm beginning to like you,
Mr. Bond.

82
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:58,873
Oh, call me James.

83
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:02,673
More than anyone I've met
in a long time, James.

84
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:06,617
What on earth are we going to
do about it?

85
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:09,219
- Yes, what?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

86
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:11,219
Where?

87
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,858
I know the best place in town.

88
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:37,608
<i>Station WEBS brings you the latest
in world news.</i>

89
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:40,478
<i>Washington.
At the White House this afternoon...</i>

90
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:43,553
<i>... the president said
he was entirely satisfied...</i>

91
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,658
That makes two of us.

92
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:58,399
<i>- Hello.
- Leiter here.</i>

93
00:14:58,604 --> 00:15:00,629
Felix.

94
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:03,240
What's that? Dinner?

95
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:07,334
No, I'm sorry, I can't.
Something big's come up.

96
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,276
<i>Right.</i>

97
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:12,140
<i>- How about breakfast?
- Okay.</i>

98
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,308
Not too early.

99
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:17,216
<i>- I'll call you around 9.
- Yes, 9:00 would be fine.</i>

100
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,789
<i>- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.</i>

101
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:32,131
It's lost its chill.

102
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,470
Oh, why, you!

103
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:42,010
- There's another in the fridge.
- Who needs it?

104
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,911
My dear girl, there are some things
that just aren't done.

105
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:47,449
Such as drinking Dom Perignon '53...

106
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:50,884
...above the temperature
of 38 degrees Fahrenheit.

107
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:54,184
That's as bad as listening
to the Beatles without earmuffs.

108
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:59,560
Now, where is this passion juice?

109
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,830
Jill?

110
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:23,109
<i>- Yes, Mr. Bond.
- Beach 7-9432.</i>

111
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,079
Room 119.

112
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:36,285
<i>- Hello?
- Felix? Get over here right away.</i>

113
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:38,554
<i>- What's up?
- The girl's dead.</i>

114
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,461
<i>- Dink?
- No, Jill Masterson.</i>

115
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:45,933
And she's covered in paint.
Gold paint.

116
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,073
Gold?

117
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,078
All over?

118
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:04,211
She died of skin suffocation. It's been
known to happen to cabaret dancers.

119
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,654
It's all right as long as you leave
a bare patch at the base of the spine...

120
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,316
...to allow the skin to breathe.

121
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:12,759
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

122
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:22,172
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.
It's an assignment, like any other.

123
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:25,571
But if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively...

124
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:28,235
...then 008 can replace you.

125
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:31,977
You've hardly distinguished yourself.

126
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,981
You were supposed to
observe Goldfinger...

127
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:35,449
...not borrow his girlfriend.

128
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:38,818
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe.
It's only by the grace of God...

129
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:42,017
...Mr. Leiter, and my intervention
with the British embassy...

130
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:44,924
...that you're not in the custody
of the Miami Beach police.

131
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,360
I'm aware of my shortcomings.

132
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,932
But I'm prepared to continue
this assignment...

133
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:52,070
...in the spirit you suggest...

134
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,569
...if I knew what it was about...

135
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:56,465
...sir.

136
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,266
What do you know about gold?
Not paint. Bullion.

137
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,146
I know it when I see it.

138
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:06,606
Meet me here at 7. Black tie.

139
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:18,352
What do you know about gold,
Moneypenny?

140
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:21,259
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

141
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:24,196
You know, on the third finger
of your left hand.

142
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:26,496
One of these days
we must look into that.

143
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:29,037
What about tonight?
You come for dinner...

144
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,699
...and I'll cook you
a beautiful angel cake.

145
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:34,709
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure...

146
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,043
...but I do have
a business appointment.

147
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:41,549
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me.

148
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:44,381
Well, some girls have all the luck.

149
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:47,217
<i>- Who is she, James?
- "She" is me, Miss Moneypenny.</i>

150
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:51,522
And kindly omit the customary byplay
with 007. He's dining with me.

151
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,721
<i>I don't want him to be late.</i>

152
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:56,865
So there's hope for me yet.

153
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:02,262
Moneypenny,
won't you ever believe me?

154
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:09,073
We at the Bank of England are the
official depository for gold bullion...

155
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:12,409
...just as Fort Knox, Kentucky
is for the United States.

156
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,346
We know the amounts
we each hold...

157
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,453
...and the amounts deposited
in other banks.

158
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:19,488
And we can estimate what is
being held for industrial purposes.

159
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,852
This enables the two governments
to establish...

160
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,324
...the true value of the dollar
and the pound.

161
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:28,431
Consequently, we are vitally concerned
with unauthorized leakages.

162
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:30,760
I take it you mean smuggling.

163
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,459
Yes.

164
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:38,234
Gold, which can be melted down
and recast, is virtually untraceable...

165
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:41,037
...which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling...

166
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:43,647
...attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

167
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,476
Thank you. That'll be all.

168
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,277
Thank you, sir.

169
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:50,319
Have a little more
of this rather disappointing brandy.

170
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,013
What's wrong with it?

171
00:20:52,524 --> 00:20:56,255
I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fins,
indifferently blended, sir...

172
00:20:57,796 --> 00:20:59,263
...with an overdose of Bons Bois.

173
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,232
Colonel Smithers
is giving the lecture, 007.

174
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:08,198
Mr. Goldfinger has gold bullion
on deposit in Zurich...

175
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:11,831
...Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong
worth 20 million pounds.

176
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,604
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

177
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,405
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country.

178
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:21,814
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,
you can sell it in Pakistan at $ 110...

179
00:21:21,987 --> 00:21:23,648
...and triple your money.

180
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:27,258
- Lf you have facilities for melting it.
- Has he?

181
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:31,156
Apart from being a legitimate
bullion dealer, Mr. Goldfinger poses...

182
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,992
No, that's not fair.

183
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:38,200
Is, among his other interests,
a legitimate international jeweler.

184
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:42,203
He's legally entitled to operate
modest metallurgical installations.

185
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,768
His British one is down in Kent.

186
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:48,844
As yet, we've failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas...

187
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:51,278
...and Lord knows we've tried.

188
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:54,212
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally...

189
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:57,514
...the bank can begin proceedings
to recover the bulk of his holdings.

190
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:02,183
It's time Mr. Goldfinger and I met.
Socially, of course.

191
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,386
I was hoping you'd say that.

192
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:09,055
It might lead to a business talk.
Mr. Goldfinger's kind of business.

193
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:11,327
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I agree.

194
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:12,868
This is the only one we have...

195
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,030
...from the Nazi hoard
at the bottom of Lake Toplitz.

196
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,335
But there are undoubtedly others.

197
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,743
Mr. Bond can make whatever use of it
he thinks fit...

198
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:24,381
...providing he returns it,
of course.

199
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,017
It's worth 5000 pounds.

200
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:33,915
You'll draw it from Q branch
with the rest of your equipment.

201
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:35,218
Of course, sir.

202
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:53,739
- Good morning, Q.
- Good morning, 007.

203
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,971
This way, please.

204
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,706
My, we are busy this morning.

205
00:23:03,922 --> 00:23:06,220
It's not perfected yet.

206
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:09,655
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

207
00:23:09,861 --> 00:23:13,058
- It's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

208
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:17,429
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB-5
with modifications.

209
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:20,568
Pay attention, please.

210
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,569
Windscreen: Bulletproof...

211
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:25,402
...as are the side and rear windows.

212
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,238
Revolving number plates, naturally.

213
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:31,074
Valid all countries.

214
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:34,878
Here's a nice transmitting device
called a "homer."

215
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:38,887
You prime it by pressing that back
like this. You see?

216
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,490
The smaller model
is now standard field issue...

217
00:23:41,693 --> 00:23:43,684
...to be fitted
into the heel of your shoe.

218
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:45,921
Its larger brother is magnetic.

219
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:49,928
Right. It's to be concealed
in the car you're trailing...

220
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:53,002
...while you keep out of sight.

221
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:56,902
Reception on the dashboard here.

222
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:02,278
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.

223
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,607
Ingenious and useful too.

224
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:07,513
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

225
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:11,211
It's not been perfected out of years
of patient research and time...

226
00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:13,414
...for that purpose, 007.

227
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:17,059
Incidentally,
we'd appreciate its return...

228
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:19,196
...along with all your other equipment.

229
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:22,093
Intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

230
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,361
You'd be surprised, the amount of
wear and tear that goes on in the field.

231
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:28,136
Anything else?

232
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,071
I won't keep you for more than an hour
if you give me your undivided attention.

233
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:35,007
We've installed
interesting modifications.

234
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,305
You see this arm?

235
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:42,779
Open the top and inside are
your defense mechanism controls.

236
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:47,220
Smoke screen, oil slick,
rear bulletproof screen...

237
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:49,825
...and left and right
front-wing machine guns.

238
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:54,124
This one I'm particularly keen about.
See the gear lever here?

239
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:58,701
If you take the top off,
you'll find a little red button.

240
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:02,299
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- Why not?

241
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:04,908
Because you'll release
this section of the roof...

242
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,739
...and engage and fire
the passenger ejector seat.

243
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,739
Ejector seat? You're joking.

244
00:25:12,484 --> 00:25:14,577
I never joke about my work, 007.

245
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:22,785
- Ready?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:25:22,994 --> 00:25:26,589
There's an old member dropped by,
same handicap as yours.

247
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,596
- Would you rather play with him?
- Where is he?

248
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:31,633
- Mr. Bond?
- Yes?

249
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:33,668
This is Mr. Goldfinger.

250
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,666
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

251
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:44,846
- You can begin. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

252
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,883
- I'll get Hawker to carry for you.
- That'll be splendid.

253
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:50,680
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

254
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:02,429
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr. Bond.
He's an admirable manservant...

255
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,693
...but mute.
He's not a very good caddy.

256
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:09,037
Golf is not yet the national game
of Korea, eh?

257
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,953
This meeting is
not a coincidence, eh?

258
00:26:25,757 --> 00:26:28,282
What's your game, Mr. Bond?

259
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,754
My game?

260
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:36,160
You didn't come here to play golf.

261
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:59,915
A 1940 smelt from Essen.

262
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,889
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.

263
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:06,291
- When the Nazis were on the run.
- Do you have access to more?

264
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,433
- Yes, from the same source.
- Interesting.

265
00:27:11,069 --> 00:27:14,334
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

266
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,339
- No objection to increasing the stakes?
- What do you have in mind?

267
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:20,970
The bar of gold you have with you,
naturally.

268
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:26,977
- It's worth 5000 pounds.
- I'll stake the cash equivalent.

269
00:27:29,454 --> 00:27:31,046
Naturally.

270
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:37,319
Strict rules of golf?

271
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,022
But of course.

272
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:15,759
Bad luck. You're in the rough.

273
00:28:24,209 --> 00:28:26,109
What a pity. Here it is.

274
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:30,275
No, it's not.
He plays a Slazenger 1.

275
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:34,752
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.
Five minutes are almost up.

276
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:37,854
The lost ball will cost you stroke
and distance.

277
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,964
I'm still training him as a caddy.

278
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,268
Successfully too.

279
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:04,080
Slazenger number 1?

280
00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:05,614
Good.

281
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:10,449
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

282
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:12,089
It isn't.

283
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,282
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

284
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:19,655
Why, you crafty old...

285
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:20,957
Leave it.

286
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:26,730
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

287
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,769
Let's have fun with Mr. Goldfinger.

288
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:37,175
- Like me to mark it or knock it in?
- Play it.

289
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,915
- This for a half?
- That's right.

290
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:57,858
One to go.
That'll be the clincher.

291
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:03,070
Did you switch them, sir?

292
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,942
- Then we've got him.
- Lf he doesn't notice the switch.

293
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:15,285
- It's your honor, sir.
- It's all right.

294
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:43,137
Down in five.

295
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:45,942
I have to sink this
to have the game, right?

296
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,553
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you.

297
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:00,522
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

298
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,063
Yes, why?

299
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,895
This is a Slazenger 7.
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

300
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,937
You must've played the wrong ball
somewhere on the 18th fairway.

301
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,702
We're playing strict rules, so I'm afraid
you lose the hole and the match.

302
00:31:51,783 --> 00:31:55,116
She's a beauty.
Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

303
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,311
- You are a clever, resourceful man.
- Thank you.

304
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:01,117
Perhaps too clever.
Twice our paths have crossed.

305
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,952
Let's leave it at that.

306
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,687
I should think our first meeting
would've convinced you.

307
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:11,392
I see. You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

308
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:15,197
Both of us know perfectly well
what we are talking about.

309
00:32:15,406 --> 00:32:18,967
But I see it is necessary
to remind you. Oddjob!

310
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,407
Many people have tried to involve
themselves in my affairs...

311
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,014
...unsuccessfully.

312
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,662
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

313
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:45,768
Nothing, Mr. Bond.

314
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,870
I own the club.

315
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:52,501
I assume you want the check
made out to cash.

316
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,803
That would be satisfactory.

317
00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:01,685
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

318
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:06,186
I believe this is yours.

319
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,591
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

320
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:47,355
<i>British United Air Ferries
announce the final call...</i>

321
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:52,969
<i>... for the departure
of their VF400 flight to Geneva.</i>

322
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:08,976
I've got you booked on the next flight
to Geneva leaving in half an hour.

323
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:11,381
- Thank you.
- Right.

324
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:32,326
Discipline, 007.

325
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,100
Discipline.

326
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:52,004
Are you all right?
Here, let me help you.

327
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:54,905
- You're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

328
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:57,478
You should've pulled over further.

329
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,146
- Look at them!
- A double blowout.

330
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:03,115
I've never seen this before.

331
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,151
How could new tires?

332
00:38:05,356 --> 00:38:07,449
A defect of some kind, most likely.

333
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:09,751
I'm so glad it's only the car
and not you.

334
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:11,895
You don't look like the sort
who should be ditched.

335
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:14,530
Never mind that.
Please take me to the nearest garage.

336
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,097
Certainly.

337
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,331
By the way, my name is Bond...

338
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:21,437
As quickly as possible.

339
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:31,473
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

340
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:40,184
What's your name?

341
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,291
Soames. Tilly Soames.

342
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:46,959
Here for the hunting season?

343
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,900
I had a case just like that one.

344
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,493
It's for my ice skates.

345
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:57,205
Lovely sport.

346
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,972
- Where do you skate?
- Saint Moritz.

347
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,305
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of year.

348
00:39:06,483 --> 00:39:07,711
There's a garage.

349
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:44,882
It'll take 24 hours to get new tires.
There's a hotel nearby.

350
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,990
- I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

351
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,852
I hate to leave you here alone.

352
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:54,997
- I can take care of myself.
- Yes, I'm sure you can.

353
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:58,066
Well, don't forget to write.

354
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:57,383
Smuggling is an art.

355
00:41:57,588 --> 00:41:59,783
And art requires...

356
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,552
In this case, the bodywork
of my Rolls-Royce is 18-karat gold.

357
00:42:06,864 --> 00:42:08,695
We dismantle it here.

358
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:11,367
We reduce the gold
in this special furnace to ingots...

359
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:16,267
...which, in turn, will weigh
approximately 2 tons in bullion.

360
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:21,872
I make six trips a year
to the continent in the Rolls-Royce.

361
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:24,810
It would be wiser to suspend
your other activities.

362
00:42:25,015 --> 00:42:27,779
Mr. Ling, assure your principals
Operation Grand Slam...

363
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,386
...will have my undivided attention.
Now, there are certain matters...

364
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:33,772
Let me go!
You're breaking my back!

365
00:43:34,251 --> 00:43:36,879
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him.

366
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,884
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

367
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:42,786
- I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister.

368
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:45,518
T.M. Tilly Masterson.

369
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:47,890
I knew your sister Jill
and what he did to her in Miami.

370
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:49,588
No, you don't! Let me go!

371
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,665
If you wanted to kill him,
why did you shoot at me?

372
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:55,236
- I didn't. I was shooting at him.
- You're a lousy shot.

373
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,303
But somebody else around here isn't.
Come on.

374
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:09,911
Quick, get in the car.
I'll take care of him.

375
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:11,566
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

376
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:22,715
Now!

377
00:50:26,096 --> 00:50:27,495
Good evening, 007.

378
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:31,730
My name is James Bond.

379
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,800
And members of
your curious profession...

380
00:50:35,972 --> 00:50:37,667
...are few in number.

381
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:41,075
You have been recognized...

382
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:44,839
...by one of your opposite numbers,
who is also licensed to kill.

383
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,539
And that interesting car of yours!

384
00:50:49,653 --> 00:50:53,714
I, too, have a new toy,
but considerably more practical.

385
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:56,552
You are looking at
an industrial laser...

386
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,752
...which emits an extraordinary light
not to be found in nature.

387
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:03,455
It can project a spot on the moon.

388
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:08,536
Or, at closer range, cut through
solid metal. I will show you.

389
00:51:35,498 --> 00:51:37,557
This is gold, Mr. Bond.

390
00:51:38,935 --> 00:51:41,403
All my life I've been in love
with its color...

391
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:44,096
...its brilliance,
its divine heaviness.

392
00:51:45,942 --> 00:51:50,470
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock...

393
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,580
...which is considerable.

394
00:51:54,551 --> 00:51:57,486
You've made your point.
Thank you for the demonstration.

395
00:51:58,755 --> 00:52:02,657
Choose your next witticism carefully.
It may be your last.

396
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:09,397
The purpose of our two previous
encounters is now clear to me.

397
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:12,535
I do not intend to be distracted
by another. Good night, Mr. Bond.

398
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:20,166
- Do you expect me to talk?
- No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.

399
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:24,606
There is nothing you can talk to me
about that I don't already know.

400
00:52:37,661 --> 00:52:38,923
You're forgetting one thing.

401
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:42,522
If I fail to report,
008 replaces me.

402
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,260
I trust he will be more successful.

403
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:51,904
He knows what I know.

404
00:52:52,275 --> 00:52:55,073
You know nothing, Mr. Bond.

405
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:58,873
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

406
00:53:23,073 --> 00:53:25,041
Two words you may
have overheard...

407
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:30,042
...which cannot have any significance
to you or anyone in your organization.

408
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:32,372
Can you afford to take that chance?

409
00:53:48,431 --> 00:53:50,399
You are right, Mr. Bond.

410
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,966
You are worth more to me alive.

411
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:28,633
Who are you?

412
00:54:28,805 --> 00:54:30,397
My name is Pussy Galore.

413
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:35,166
I must be dreaming.

414
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:50,192
- I thought I'd wake up dead.
- Tranquilizer gun. Knockout shot.

415
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,225
I see.

416
00:54:54,664 --> 00:54:58,122
I'm delighted to be here.

417
00:54:59,936 --> 00:55:02,996
And, by the way,
where is here?

418
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:06,607
Thirty-five thousand feet,
flying southwest over Newfoundland.

419
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:09,877
That explains the humming.

420
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,482
You're in Mr. Goldfinger's Lockheed
JetStar heading for Baltimore.

421
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:17,551
- You're his guest.
- I'm honored.

422
00:55:17,754 --> 00:55:21,121
I never realized he enjoyed
my company that much.

423
00:55:21,324 --> 00:55:24,418
It won't be all fun and games.
Mei-Lei.

424
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:29,127
Can I do something for you,
Mr. Bond?

425
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:32,324
Just a drink. A martini, shaken...

426
00:55:32,535 --> 00:55:34,002
...not stirred.

427
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:38,640
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

428
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:40,867
I'm Mr. Goldfinger's personal pilot.

429
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:43,744
You are?

430
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,006
And how personal is that?

431
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,713
I'm a damn good pilot. Period.

432
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,320
That's good news.

433
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:55,582
- Where is our host?
- He flew ahead.

434
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:01,062
Thank you.

435
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,765
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

436
00:56:14,777 --> 00:56:16,108
This should be a memorable flight.

437
00:56:17,547 --> 00:56:21,108
You can turn off the charm.
I'm immune.

438
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,328
We land in Baltimore...

439
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:42,728
<i>... our port of entry
into the United States, in 55 minutes.</i>

440
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:45,030
Mei-Lei...

441
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:48,904
...I would like to arrive
more appropriately dressed.

442
00:56:49,112 --> 00:56:52,206
Did any of my luggage
survive with me?

443
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:56,074
And my attache case?

444
00:56:56,286 --> 00:56:59,847
Black attache case damaged
when examined. So sorry.

445
00:57:00,056 --> 00:57:02,547
Apology is quite unnecessary.

446
00:57:09,532 --> 00:57:12,399
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

447
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:51,728
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

448
00:58:51,934 --> 00:58:56,564
Want to play it easy, or the hard way?
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

449
00:58:56,773 --> 00:58:59,936
You know a lot more about planes
than guns.

450
00:59:00,143 --> 00:59:02,407
That's a Smith & Wesson.45.

451
00:59:02,578 --> 00:59:05,945
If you fired this close, the bullet would
go through me and the fuselage...

452
00:59:06,149 --> 00:59:08,413
...like a blowtorch through butter.

453
00:59:08,618 --> 00:59:13,078
The cabin will depressurize, and we'll
be sucked into outer space together.

454
00:59:13,256 --> 00:59:15,690
If that's how you want to enter
the States, you're welcome.

455
00:59:15,858 --> 00:59:17,723
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

456
00:59:17,894 --> 00:59:19,759
That's very sensible.

457
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,329
There's always so much
going on around Mr. Goldfinger.

458
00:59:22,498 --> 00:59:26,127
I wouldn't dream of not accepting
his hospitality.

459
00:59:26,736 --> 00:59:28,897
He'll be very glad to see you too.

460
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:32,401
You like close shaves, don't you?

461
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,308
<i>Washington, sir,
on the green scrambler.</i>

462
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:43,608
<i>- M here.
- Leiter, sir.</i>

463
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,085
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal.

464
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:50,259
It's monitored into Baltimore
where he's just landed.

465
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:54,760
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.
Last we heard he was in Switzerland.

466
00:59:54,931 --> 00:59:59,698
He came in on a private jet registered
to our old friend, Auric Goldfinger.

467
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:03,464
I'm glad he's making progress.
Keep an eye on him.

468
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:06,767
Their flight plan gives Kentucky
as their final destination.

469
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:09,104
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything.

470
01:00:09,312 --> 01:00:11,803
He's evidently well on top
at the moment.

471
01:00:34,036 --> 01:00:36,266
- Mr. Bond, please.
- Of course.

472
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,564
Anytime.

473
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:42,266
Thank you.

474
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,015
Do mind your step, captain.

475
01:00:57,226 --> 01:00:59,786
Just keep playing it easy.

476
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:04,689
Will you see everything's arranged
with Mr. Goldfinger?

477
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:06,232
Of course.

478
01:01:26,355 --> 01:01:27,845
Talented chaps.

479
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:30,719
They should be.
I trained them.

480
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:32,258
Come on.

481
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:34,453
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

482
01:01:34,664 --> 01:01:38,657
I believe the bourbon and branch water
is splendid here in Kentucky.

483
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:42,065
Now that we're both off duty,
perhaps...

484
01:01:48,611 --> 01:01:53,173
Manners, Oddjob. I thought
you always took your hat off to a lady.

485
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:59,480
- He kills little girls like you.
- Little boys too.

486
01:02:45,201 --> 01:02:47,669
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

487
01:02:47,837 --> 01:02:51,603
You'll get your final briefing tonight.
That'll be all for now.

488
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:24,971
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr. Bond.

489
01:03:25,174 --> 01:03:29,042
- Lovely animal, isn't she?
- Certainly better bred than the owner.

490
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:32,775
Show Mr. Bond
to his quarters, please.

491
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,643
Felix.

492
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:42,110
- Maybe we should drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

493
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:51,185
They're all here, Mr. Goldfinger.

494
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:54,454
Oh, yes, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

495
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:06,631
Solo's gonna wear a hole
in his shoes.

496
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:18,548
Gentlemen.

497
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:21,815
Why weren't we told New York
and the West Coast were in on this?

498
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:25,983
- Look who's talking.
- I do not do business with Chicago.

499
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,629
I thought we had a private
business deal to settle.

500
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:31,323
Now I find I'm attending
a hoods' convention.

501
01:05:31,534 --> 01:05:35,971
- I made a delivery. Where's my money?
- I made a delivery too.

502
01:05:36,172 --> 01:05:38,766
You all made the deliveries
we contracted for.

503
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:41,205
And you owe me 1 million bucks.

504
01:05:42,178 --> 01:05:46,547
I owe each of you a million
in gold bullion.

505
01:05:46,749 --> 01:05:48,876
So pay!

506
01:05:49,084 --> 01:05:53,214
Gentlemen, you can have
the million today...

507
01:05:54,623 --> 01:05:57,251
...or 10 millions tomorrow!

508
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,121
Did you say 10 million?

509
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.

510
01:06:02,031 --> 01:06:03,999
Banks don't open on Sunday.

511
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:06,359
My bank will.

512
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:16,071
What's with that trick pool table?

513
01:06:25,754 --> 01:06:29,155
- Cover him!
- Cover those doors.

514
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:30,986
Turn those lights back on!

515
01:06:32,228 --> 01:06:34,492
What are you trying
to pull, Goldfinger?

516
01:06:34,697 --> 01:06:38,030
There is no cause
for alarm, gentlemen.

517
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:45,102
I don't like being cooped up like this.
What's that map doing there?

518
01:06:55,918 --> 01:07:00,685
This is my bank,
the Gold Depository at Fort Knox.

519
01:07:01,857 --> 01:07:06,590
In its vaults are $ 15 billion...

520
01:07:06,795 --> 01:07:11,027
...the entire gold supply
of the United States.

521
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,895
Knock off Fort Knox?

522
01:07:15,638 --> 01:07:17,037
Got a key or something?

523
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,833
Of a kind.

524
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:24,570
- There are 35,000 troops there.
- Forty-one thousand.

525
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,214
And who's gonna say "boo" to them?

526
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:30,213
- Hey, what's going on?
- What is this?

527
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:57,240
Man has climbed Mount Everest...

528
01:07:57,446 --> 01:07:59,778
...gone to the bottom of the ocean.

529
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:04,111
He has fired rockets to the moon,
split the atom.

530
01:08:04,286 --> 01:08:06,151
Achieved miracles...

531
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:09,917
...in every field of human endeavor
except crime!

532
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:18,409
The underworld will
rock with applause for centuries.

533
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,588
- Cut the commercial.
- Get to the point.

534
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:23,418
You're wasting my time.
The depository's impregnable.

535
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:26,753
The joint is bombproof, electrified,
lousy with...

536
01:10:26,962 --> 01:10:31,126
Bear with me, please!
Fort Knox is a bank like any other.

537
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:35,531
Larger, better protected perhaps,
but nonetheless, a bank.

538
01:10:35,738 --> 01:10:37,899
It can be,
I think the expression is...

539
01:10:38,073 --> 01:10:39,472
...blown!

540
01:10:39,675 --> 01:10:43,941
My plan is foolproof.
I call it...

541
01:10:44,113 --> 01:10:45,944
...Operation Grand Slam.

542
01:10:46,148 --> 01:10:49,743
I have devoted 15 years
of my life to it.

543
01:10:49,952 --> 01:10:53,012
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

544
01:10:53,222 --> 01:10:55,452
Every eventuality
has been considered.

545
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:58,455
We'll operate
on a split-second schedule.

546
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,595
Your organization, Mr. Midnight,
brought a consignment...

547
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:03,994
...of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

548
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,600
They contain Delta Nine.

549
01:11:06,769 --> 01:11:10,227
- What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas.

550
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:13,431
It disperses 15 minutes
after inducing...

551
01:11:13,642 --> 01:11:18,705
...complete unconsciousness
for 24 hours.

552
01:11:20,783 --> 01:11:23,047
Tomorrow at dawn...

553
01:11:23,252 --> 01:11:26,187
...the Flying Circus of my pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore...

554
01:11:26,955 --> 01:11:29,822
...will spray it
into the atmosphere.

555
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:37,064
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilized...

556
01:11:37,232 --> 01:11:39,496
...my task force,
which Mr. Strap and his people...

557
01:11:39,668 --> 01:11:42,102
...smuggled across the Rio Grande
from Mexico...

558
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:44,432
...will approach Fort Knox...

559
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,666
...in motorized equipment
along Bullion Boulevard...

560
01:11:47,843 --> 01:11:50,311
...which runs past the depository...

561
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:52,571
...and intersects
with Gold Vault Road.

562
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:57,382
This fence
surrounding the depository...

563
01:11:57,553 --> 01:12:01,011
...as Mr. Strap reminded us,
is electrified.

564
01:12:01,223 --> 01:12:03,453
It will be dynamited.

565
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:06,822
My task force will then move to
the main entrance and demolish it.

566
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:08,929
How, may I ask?

567
01:12:09,131 --> 01:12:11,395
You made that possible, Mr. Solo.

568
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,194
By arranging through your influence
in shipping circles...

569
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:16,166
...to bring through customs,
uninspected...

570
01:12:16,338 --> 01:12:19,330
...a consignment labeled
"machine parts."

571
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:22,437
All that will remain
is to descend to the vaults...

572
01:12:22,644 --> 01:12:24,407
...where the bullion is stored.

573
01:12:24,613 --> 01:12:29,880
I've heard enough. If you have
no objection, I'll take my money now.

574
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:33,748
What's the matter, Solo?
Too big for you to handle?

575
01:12:40,963 --> 01:12:46,401
We must respect Mr. Solo's decision.
Excuse me while I take care of him.

576
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:47,933
Make yourselves comfortable.

577
01:13:22,571 --> 01:13:23,902
Pussy!

578
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:26,603
Who taught you judo?

579
01:13:26,942 --> 01:13:28,170
The gun you took.

580
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,238
Oh, the gun.

581
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:36,274
The gun, of course.

582
01:13:45,928 --> 01:13:49,056
We must have a few fast falls
together sometime.

583
01:14:05,948 --> 01:14:08,610
Strap, if he's got the right answers...

584
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:11,786
...we don't have to be there.
The boys can handle everything.

585
01:14:19,294 --> 01:14:23,856
- They closed up the fire pit.
- I don't like this.

586
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:25,499
<i>What's going on here?</i>

587
01:14:30,739 --> 01:14:32,297
The gas!

588
01:14:56,598 --> 01:15:00,432
Such a pity you did not choose
to remain with the others, Mr. Solo.

589
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:08,739
Mr. Bond, I thought you were resting
in your quarters.

590
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:12,744
They are delightful,
but it's much too nice to stay indoors.

591
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:16,714
I ran into Miss Galore
and she suggested that we join you.

592
01:15:17,285 --> 01:15:20,482
Mr. Solo, Mr. Bond.
Another of my distinguished guests.

593
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:22,554
Leaving us so soon, Mr. Solo?

594
01:15:22,758 --> 01:15:25,386
Unfortunately,
he has a pressing engagement.

595
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:28,154
I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.
Boy.

596
01:15:28,363 --> 01:15:29,955
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

597
01:15:30,132 --> 01:15:32,657
My plane will get you
to New York on time...

598
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:35,234
...with your excess luggage.

599
01:15:35,937 --> 01:15:37,495
Allow me.

600
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:43,074
My chauffeur is an excellent driver.
You will be at the airport soon.

601
01:15:43,278 --> 01:15:45,872
Goodbye, Mr. Solo.
Some other time, perhaps.

602
01:15:46,081 --> 01:15:48,140
Happy landings, old boy.

603
01:15:54,056 --> 01:15:55,990
I found him under the model.

604
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,723
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

605
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:07,334
So did I.

606
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,819
He's on the move!

607
01:16:51,346 --> 01:16:53,837
Slow down. Don't crowd him.

608
01:17:10,499 --> 01:17:13,366
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn.

609
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:46,662
They've turned to the right
just ahead.

610
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:04,979
Where's this old pal
of yours headed?

611
01:18:05,153 --> 01:18:08,122
Ten will get you one,
it's a drink or a dame.

612
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:18,044
Dead.

613
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:20,687
- Mechanical failure, maybe.
- Unless he switched it off.

614
01:20:20,855 --> 01:20:23,085
Why would he do that?

615
01:20:25,293 --> 01:20:28,160
- Drive to the farm. It's all we can do.
- Right.

616
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:41,004
Thank you.

617
01:20:43,945 --> 01:20:48,905
Your share of Operation Grand Slam
will make you a very rich woman.

618
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:51,745
Why else would I be in it,
Mr. Goldfinger?

619
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:55,220
You'll retire to England,
I suppose?

620
01:20:55,423 --> 01:20:58,324
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

621
01:20:58,526 --> 01:21:01,859
I'll hang up a sign,
"No trespassing"...

622
01:21:02,397 --> 01:21:04,456
...and go back to nature.

623
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:10,569
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

624
01:21:10,772 --> 01:21:12,967
Touts, looking for racing tips.

625
01:21:18,046 --> 01:21:21,709
There's another possibility, however.
Kisch, ask Mr. Bond to join us.

626
01:21:22,283 --> 01:21:27,016
We were right to spare Mr. Bond's life
in Switzerland if those are his friends.

627
01:21:27,222 --> 01:21:29,952
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

628
01:21:31,426 --> 01:21:35,760
For their benefit, Pussy,
let's make him as happy as possible.

629
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:40,027
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

630
01:21:40,235 --> 01:21:41,566
Certainly.

631
01:21:42,303 --> 01:21:44,635
Business before pleasure.

632
01:22:04,058 --> 01:22:05,753
He wants you.

633
01:22:14,669 --> 01:22:17,194
Mr. Bond, sit down, please.

634
01:22:17,405 --> 01:22:20,533
Mint julep?
Traditional, but satisfying.

635
01:22:20,742 --> 01:22:24,701
Yes, thanks.
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

636
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:28,840
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

637
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,416
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

638
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:35,055
Incidentally,
Delta Nine nerve gas is fatal.

639
01:22:36,124 --> 01:22:38,718
You are unusually well-informed,
Mr. Bond.

640
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:41,589
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

641
01:22:41,796 --> 01:22:44,822
American motorists kill that many
every two years.

642
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:48,662
Yes. Well, I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

643
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:54,308
Fifteen billion dollars in gold bullion
weighs 10,500 tons.

644
01:22:54,476 --> 01:22:57,070
Sixty men would take 12 days...

645
01:22:57,278 --> 01:23:00,247
...to load it onto 200 trucks.

646
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:02,473
At the most,
you'll have two hours...

647
01:23:02,684 --> 01:23:06,120
...before the military moves in
and makes you put it back.

648
01:23:07,489 --> 01:23:10,481
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

649
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:16,597
The julep tart enough for you?

650
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:20,234
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank...

651
01:23:20,435 --> 01:23:22,869
...but not to steal anything?

652
01:23:23,071 --> 01:23:24,402
Why?

653
01:23:25,106 --> 01:23:26,130
Go on, Mr. Bond.

654
01:23:26,474 --> 01:23:29,238
Mr. Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory...

655
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:32,504
...is a specialist in nuclear fission.

656
01:23:34,682 --> 01:23:38,675
But of course!
His government's given you a bomb.

657
01:23:39,187 --> 01:23:43,749
I prefer to call it an atomic device.
It's small, but particularly dirty.

658
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:46,791
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

659
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:49,521
If you explode it in Fort Knox...

660
01:23:51,232 --> 01:23:53,462
...the entire gold supply
of the United States...

661
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:55,432
...will be radioactive for...

662
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:57,697
...57 years.

663
01:23:58,172 --> 01:23:59,571
Fifty-eight, to be exact.

664
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:04,269
I apologize. It's an inspired deal.

665
01:24:04,445 --> 01:24:08,108
They get what they want,
economic chaos in the West.

666
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:10,546
And the value of your gold
increases many times.

667
01:24:11,352 --> 01:24:15,345
I conservatively estimate
ten times.

668
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:17,115
Brilliant.

669
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:21,252
But the atomic device,
as you call it...

670
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,560
...is already, obviously,
in this country.

671
01:24:25,233 --> 01:24:26,257
Obviously.

672
01:24:27,969 --> 01:24:33,271
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected
could be very risky.

673
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:36,171
On the contrary,
the risk is all on your side.

674
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:42,011
If the authorities try locating it,
who knows where it might be exploded.

675
01:24:42,183 --> 01:24:45,448
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens
at New London.

676
01:24:46,854 --> 01:24:50,187
Cape Kennedy?
Near the White House?

677
01:24:50,358 --> 01:24:52,189
But we are speculating idly.

678
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:54,760
Operation Grand Slam
will be successful.

679
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:58,865
You will be there to see for yourself.
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

680
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:12,609
Forgive me, Mr. Bond.

681
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,978
I must arrange to separate my gold
from the late Mr. Solo.

682
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:19,881
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

683
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:23,883
Very chic, Miss Galore!
Don't you agree?

684
01:25:24,092 --> 01:25:25,923
Please entertain Mr. Bond
for me, Pussy.

685
01:25:26,094 --> 01:25:28,085
I'll join you both later.

686
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:36,193
Well, how about it, handsome?

687
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:39,339
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

688
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,167
Well, the new Miss Galore.

689
01:25:41,342 --> 01:25:44,072
Where do you hide
your gold knuckles in this outfit?

690
01:25:44,245 --> 01:25:47,681
I never carry weapons
after business hours.

691
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:50,248
Yeah? So you're off duty.

692
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:55,252
- I'm completely defenseless.
- So am I.

693
01:26:01,963 --> 01:26:03,590
That's my James.

694
01:26:03,765 --> 01:26:08,998
- Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.
- Yes. I'm glad you're enjoying it.

695
01:26:09,203 --> 01:26:11,865
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

696
01:26:13,441 --> 01:26:14,703
He's quite mad, you know.

697
01:26:17,512 --> 01:26:20,310
Well, now, what do we have here?

698
01:26:21,549 --> 01:26:25,144
007 seems to have the situation
well in hand.

699
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,287
I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

700
01:26:28,456 --> 01:26:31,755
- You're quite a girl.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

701
01:26:32,393 --> 01:26:35,362
I'd like to think
you're not in all of this caper.

702
01:26:36,064 --> 01:26:39,124
Skip it. I'm not interested.
Let's go.

703
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:42,734
What would it take
for you to see things my way?

704
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:46,236
- A lot more than you've got.
- How do you know?

705
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:48,574
I don't want to know.

706
01:26:50,912 --> 01:26:54,507
Isn't it customary to grant
a condemned man his last request?

707
01:26:54,716 --> 01:26:56,047
You've asked for this.

708
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:05,149
Get up.

709
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,256
Certainly.

710
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:28,539
Now let's both play.

711
01:27:56,577 --> 01:27:58,602
<i>Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.</i>

712
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,180
<i>Commence Rock-A-Bye Baby.
Good luck.</i>

713
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,962
Speed: 220.

714
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:28,472
Wind check: Westerly.

715
01:28:40,755 --> 01:28:42,655
Champagne leader
to Champagne section.

716
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:44,553
Commence dive now!

717
01:28:53,768 --> 01:28:55,759
Ready for Rock-A-Bye Baby.

718
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,371
Commence spray on countdown.
Five...

719
01:28:59,707 --> 01:29:01,436
<i>... four, three...</i>

720
01:29:02,109 --> 01:29:03,872
<i>... two, zero.</i>

721
01:30:48,983 --> 01:30:51,781
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam leader.

722
01:30:51,953 --> 01:30:53,215
The baby is asleep.

723
01:30:53,387 --> 01:30:56,982
<i>I repeat, the baby is asleep.
We're going home now.</i>

724
01:30:57,892 --> 01:30:59,382
<i>Out.</i>

725
01:35:27,294 --> 01:35:30,957
Good morning, Mr. Bond. For once,
you are exactly where I want you.

726
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:41,528
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, brigadier.

727
01:36:41,735 --> 01:36:44,966
- Right. Move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

728
01:36:45,172 --> 01:36:48,471
Minimum offensive fire until
I signal bomb has been neutralized.

729
01:36:48,642 --> 01:36:52,544
Minimum offensive fire until
I signal bomb has been neutralized.

730
01:36:52,713 --> 01:36:55,011
<i>Bomb disposal unit
to accompany DOG.</i>

731
01:37:29,683 --> 01:37:30,707
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

732
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:07,918
Mr. Ling, it's merely
a matter of timing.

733
01:38:41,321 --> 01:38:45,451
He's one of them, so is the girl!
I'll get her. You get the door open.

734
01:38:58,906 --> 01:39:02,672
We're trapped.
The bomb. I'll take the fuse out.

735
01:39:04,978 --> 01:39:09,642
Don't be a fool!
You can be a hero, I'm not.

736
01:39:12,486 --> 01:39:13,851
No. No!

737
01:44:34,007 --> 01:44:37,067
Come on. Get going. Hurry up!

738
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:58,088
What kept you?

739
01:44:59,499 --> 01:45:01,694
You okay?
Where's your butler friend?

740
01:45:02,536 --> 01:45:04,163
He blew a fuse.

741
01:45:04,838 --> 01:45:08,330
Three more ticks and Mr. Goldfinger
would have hit the jackpot.

742
01:45:08,508 --> 01:45:10,738
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

743
01:45:10,911 --> 01:45:13,937
- And Pussy?
- She switched the gas in the canisters.

744
01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:17,447
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

745
01:45:19,519 --> 01:45:22,511
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

746
01:45:30,096 --> 01:45:33,259
James, get aboard.
You can't keep the president waiting.

747
01:45:33,466 --> 01:45:36,162
Special plane,
lunch at the White House. How come?

748
01:45:36,369 --> 01:45:38,701
The president wants
to thank you personally.

749
01:45:38,905 --> 01:45:42,397
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

750
01:45:43,577 --> 01:45:45,442
I suppose I'll be able
to get a drink here.

751
01:45:45,645 --> 01:45:47,670
I told the stewardess
liquor for three.

752
01:45:47,881 --> 01:45:50,441
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

753
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,550
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

754
01:45:52,752 --> 01:45:54,777
- Thank you, brigadier.
- Good luck.

755
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,915
I am glad to have you aboard.

756
01:46:29,556 --> 01:46:33,014
Congratulations on your promotion,
Goldfinger.

757
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,728
Are you having lunch
at the White House too?

758
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:37,989
In two hours, I shall be in Cuba.

759
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:43,193
And you have interfered with my plans
for the last time, Mr. Bond.

760
01:46:43,403 --> 01:46:47,100
It's dangerous to fire guns in planes.
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

761
01:46:48,608 --> 01:46:51,509
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

762
01:46:51,678 --> 01:46:54,169
She is where she ought to be,
at the controls.

763
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:45,720
What happened?
Where's Goldfinger?

764
01:47:45,899 --> 01:47:47,764
Playing his golden harp.

765
01:47:50,503 --> 01:47:52,164
It's no good.

766
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:28,532
No, you don't!

767
01:48:29,776 --> 01:48:32,176
This is no time to be rescued.
