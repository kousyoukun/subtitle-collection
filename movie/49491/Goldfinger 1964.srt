1
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,800
Mr Romales and his friends
will be out of business.

3
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:13,371
At least he won't be using heroin-flavoured
bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,591
Don't go back to your hotel, señor.
They'll be watching you.

5
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,118
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but

6
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,490
first I have some unfinished business
to attend to.

7
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,770
Forgive me.

8
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,940
Why do you always wear that thing?

9
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,785
I have a slight inferiority complex.

10
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,700
Where was I? Oh, yes.

11
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:50,936
Shocking!

12
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,176
Positively shocking.

13
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,426
Goldfinger

14
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,630
He's the man

15
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,090
The man with the Midas touch

16
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,841
A spider's touch

17
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:42,145
Such a cold finger

18
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,570
Beckons you

19
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,080
To enter his web of sin

20
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,080
But don't go in

21
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,010
Golden words he will pour in your ear

22
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,770
But his lies can't disguise what you fear

23
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:09,610
For a golden girl

24
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,541
Knows when he's kissed her

25
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,900
It's the kiss of death

26
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:20,080
From Mr Goldfinger

27
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,420
Pretty girl

28
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,840
Beware of this heart of gold

29
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,180
This heart is cold

30
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,940
Golden words he will pour in your ear

31
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,610
But his lies can't disguise what you fear

32
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,450
For a golden girl

33
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,154
Knows when he's kissed her

34
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:53,555
It's the kiss of death

35
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,808
From Mr Goldfinger

36
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,180
Pretty girl

37
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,270
Beware of this heart of gold

38
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,280
This heart is cold

39
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,620
He loves only gold

40
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,290
Only gold

41
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,427
He loves gold

42
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:29,640
He loves only gold

43
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,680
Only gold

44
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:42,532
He loves gold

45
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,611
- How's this?
- It's nice...  very nice.

46
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:03,595
- Just here?
- No, a little lower, darling.

47
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,154
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

48
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,878
Felix! How are you?

49
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,580
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!

50
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,750
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

51
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,895
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

52
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,116
Man talk.

53
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,671
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

54
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,398
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica, didn't they?

55
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,329
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

56
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,489
Not anymore you're not.
Signal from London.

57
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,166
I might of known M wouldn't book me into the

58
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,659
best hotel in Miami Beach out of pure gratitude.

59
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,110
He asked us to keep
an eye on him for you.

60
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,521
Auric Goldfinger.
Sounds like a French nail varnish!

61
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,919
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.

62
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Big operator, worldwide interests.
All apparently quite reputable.

63
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,170
Owns one of the finest stud farms in the States.

64
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,854
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean as far as CIA is concerned.

65
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:54,590
And where do I find him?

66
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,999
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

67
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,626
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners every day for a week.

68
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,920
Morning, Mr Simmons!
Ready for our little game?

69
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,879
Sure I'm ready. When you're ten grand
in the hole, you're ready for anything.

70
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:22,016
- Could I have my usual seat?
- Oh, you and your suntan!

71
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,308
That Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

72
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,822
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.

73
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,815
Five dollars a point.

74
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:35,110
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.

75
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:36,451
OK.

76
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:40,487
I'll get back to the office
and cable M you're on the job.

77
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,719
- You can fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

78
00:11:00,676 --> 00:11:02,829
- Four.
- So soon?

79
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:03,859
How many?

80
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,450
7, 12, 18, 32,

81
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:09,540
44.

82
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:19,848
Miss?

83
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,230
Hey, what are you... ?

84
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,650
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!

85
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:27,615
Yes, I know.

86
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,316
You're very sweet.

87
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,920
He just drew the king of clubs.
That makes his count 59.

88
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:44,827
He's got a diamond run: eight, nine, ten.

89
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:50,390
He's holding on to the six of spades,
so I guess he thinks you want it.

90
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,984
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

91
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,813
He needs kings and queens.

92
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,968
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

93
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,002
Come on, come on!

94
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,745
Hah, that's more like it!

95
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,126
- What's your name?
- Jill.

96
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,190
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

97
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:31,877
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.

98
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,756
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.

99
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,709
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.

100
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,724
Just seen?

101
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,471
Just seen.

102
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,109
I'm so glad.

103
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:53,252
You're much too nice to be mixed up
in anything like this, you know.

104
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:02,200
Now hear this, Goldfinger.
Your luck has just changed.

105
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,953
I doubt very much if the Miami Beach police
would take kindly to what you're doing.

106
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,760
Nod your head if you agree.

107
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,197
Nod.

108
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:16,350
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.

109
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,837
Shall we say .........
$10,000?

110
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:21,770
No, let's be generous.

111
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,940
Let's make it $15,000.

112
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:28,033
May I see?

113
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,082
Well, I can see this is really my day!

114
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:40,104
Gin!

115
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,291
Over and out.

116
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:52,746
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.

117
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:55,620
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.

118
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,145
Ohh.......  Call me James.

119
00:13:58,502 --> 00:14:01,620
More than anyone I've met
in a long time... James.

120
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,610
Well, what on earth
are we going to do about it?

121
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,469
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.

122
00:14:08,944 --> 00:14:09,724
Where?

123
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,152
Well, I know the best place in town.

124
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,800
Station WEDS brings you
the latest in world news.

125
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,976
Washington. At the White House this afternoon,

126
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,791
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...

127
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:48,703
That makes two of us.

128
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

129
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,670
- Oh! Felix!
- Well, now?

130
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,920
What's that? Dinner?

131
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:04,538
Ah.. No, look, I'm sorry.

132
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:06,760
I can't. Something big's come up.

133
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,930
How about breakfast?

134
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,191
- OK.
- Not too early.

135
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,768
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.

136
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:19,097
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

137
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,125
Oh, it's lost its chill!

138
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,350
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.

139
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,020
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.

140
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,940
Such as drinking Dom Pérignon '53

141
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:49,950
above a temperature of 38° Fahrenheit.

142
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:53,614
That's as bad as listening
to the Beatles without earmuffs.

143
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,248
Now... where is this passion juice?

144
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,431
Jill?

145
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,573
Yes, Mr Bond?

146
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:24,313
Beach 79432. Room 119.

147
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,310
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.

148
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,722
Get over here right away.

149
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,980
- What's up?
- The girl's dead.

150
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:41,168
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.

151
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:45,221
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.

152
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:56,904
Gold?

153
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,429
All over?

154
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,740
She died of skin suffocation.
It's been known to happen to cabaret dancers.

155
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:07,145
It's all right so as long as you leave a small
bare patch at the base of the spine

156
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:08,844
to allow the skin to breathe.

157
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,570
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.

158
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,889
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

159
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,388
It's an assignment like any other.

160
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,631
And if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

161
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,090
008 can replace you.

162
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,650
You've hardly distinguished yourself, have you?

163
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,048
You were supposed to observe Mr Goldfinger.
Not borrow his girlfriend.

164
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:39,367
Instead of that, Goldfinger goes to Europe
and it's only by the grace of God, you friend Leiter

165
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,633
and my intervention with the British Embassy in Washington

166
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,120
that you're not in the custody
of the Miami Beach police!

167
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,275
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.

168
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:50,920
But I'm prepared to continue this
assignment in the spirit you suggest

169
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,670
if I knew what it was about,

170
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:55,788
sir.

171
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,150
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

172
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:01,874
I know it when I see it.

173
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,270
Meet me here at seven.

174
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,935
Black tie.

175
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,749
And what do you know about gold,
Moneypenny?

176
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:20,737
Oh, the only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

177
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,044
You know, on the third finger
of your left hand.

178
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:26,263
One of these days
we really must look into that.

179
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:29,251
Well, what about tonight?
You come round for dinner

180
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,100
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

181
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,965
Oh, nothing would give me greater pleasure

182
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:37,530
but unfortunately I do have
a... business appointment.

183
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,710
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me!

184
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:43,460
Oh well, some girls have all the luck!

185
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,794
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

186
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:51,039
and kindly omit the customary by-play
with 007. He's dining with me

187
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,970
and I don't want him to be late.

188
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,747
So there's hope for me yet?

189
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:59,153
Moneypenny...

190
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,531
Won't you ever believe me?

191
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,040
We here at the Bank of England, Mr Bond

192
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,676
are the official depository
for gold bullion.

193
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:11,679
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.

194
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:15,970
We know, of course, the amounts we each hold.
We Know the amounts deposited in other banks.

195
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,100
And we can estimate what is being held
for industrial purposes.

196
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,480
This enables the two governments to establish respectively

197
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,980
the true value
of the dollar and the pound.

198
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,350
Consequently, we are rightly concerned
with unauthorised leakages.

199
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:29,891
I take it you mean smuggling.

200
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,117
Yes.

201
00:20:32,253 --> 00:20:37,391
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted
down and recast, is virtually untraceable.

202
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:40,556
Which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

203
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,104
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

204
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:46,339
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.

205
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:50,247
Have a little more of this...
rather disappointing brandy.

206
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:53,849
- Well, what's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine,

207
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:55,734
indifferently blended, sir.

208
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,266
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

209
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:02,184
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.

210
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:07,134
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

211
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:11,457
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas
and Hong Kong-worth £20 million.

212
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,366
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?

213
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:16,822
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country.

214
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,520
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

215
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,100
and triple your money.

216
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,897
- Providing of course you have the facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?

217
00:21:27,017 --> 00:21:30,280
Apart from being a legitimate
bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...

218
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,861
Aah.. No, that's not quite fair.

219
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:37,696
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweller.

220
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:42,550
He's legally entitled to operate
modest metallurgical installations.

221
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,330
His British one is down in Kent.

222
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,083
As yet, we have failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.

223
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,522
And Lord knows we've tried.

224
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,833
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,

225
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:57,100
then the bank could institute proceedings
to recover the bulk of his holdings.

226
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,121
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.

227
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,711
Socially, of course.

228
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,786
I was hoping you'd say that.

229
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:08,575
It might lead to a business talk...
Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.

230
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,957
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.

231
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:15,633
This is the only one we have from the Nazi hoard
at the bottom of Lake Toplitz.

232
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:17,757
But there are undoubtedly others.

233
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,890
Mr Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit.

234
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,459
Providing he returns it, of course.

235
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:26,086
It's worth £5,000.

236
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,682
You'll draw it from Q branch with the
rest of your equipment in the morning.

237
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:35,025
Of course, sir.

238
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,985
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.

239
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,730
This way, please.

240
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,375
My, we are busy this morning!

241
00:23:03,486 --> 00:23:05,040
It's not perfected yet.

242
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:09,187
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

243
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:12,459
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

244
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:17,039
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5
with modifications.

245
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,492
Now, pay attention, please.

246
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:24,696
Windscreen-bulletproof.
As are the side and the rear windows.

247
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,495
Revolving number plates, naturally.

248
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:29,472
Valid all countries.

249
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:34,164
Here's a nice little transmitting device,
called a homer.

250
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,944
You prime it by pressing that back
like this. You see?

251
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:41,047
The smaller model is now
standard field issue,

252
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,207
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

253
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,322
Its larger brother is magnetic.

254
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:51,870
Right. To be concealed in the car
you're trailing while you keep out of sight.

255
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,650
Reception

256
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:56,726
on the dashboard here.

257
00:23:58,457 --> 00:24:01,480
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.

258
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:03,670
Ingenious, and useful too.

259
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,050
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

260
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:10,151
It has not been perfected
out of years of patient research

261
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,489
entirely for that purpose, 007.

262
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:18,632
And incidentally we'd appreciate its return,
along with all your other equipment.

263
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:21,557
Intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

264
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,861
Oh, you'd be surprised the amount of wear
and tear that goes on out there in the field.

265
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:29,507
- Anything else?
- Well, I won't keep you for more than an hour or so

266
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:31,648
if you give me
your undivided attention.

267
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:34,777
We've installed some rather
interesting modifications.

268
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:37,390
You see this arm here?

269
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:42,243
Now, open the top and inside are
your defence mechanism controls.

270
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,641
Smoke screen. Oil slick.

271
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,782
Rear bulletproof screen.

272
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,611
And left and right
front-wing machine guns.

273
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:53,685
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.
You see the gear lever here?

274
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:55,716
Now, if you take the top off,

275
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,954
you'll find a little red button.

276
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,754
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?

277
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:04,450
Because you'll release
this section of the roof

278
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,292
and engage and fire
the passenger ejector seat. Whisst!

279
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,255
Ejector seat? You're joking!

280
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:14,384
I never joke about my work, 007.

281
00:25:20,082 --> 00:25:21,660
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:25,809
Ah, there's an old member dropped by, sir.
Same handicap as yours.

283
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,022
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?

284
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:30,531
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?

285
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,759
This is Mr Goldfinger.

286
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:39,017
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

287
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,373
- You can go straight off. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.

288
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:47,463
- I'll get Hawker to carry for you, Mr Bond.
- Well, that'll be splendid.

289
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,725
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?
Un-huh.

290
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,762
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.

291
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:00,583
Oh, you must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.

292
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:02,071
He's an admirable manservant

293
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:04,240
but mute. He's not a very good caddy.

294
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,970
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea, hey?

295
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,957
This meeting is not a coincidence, hey?

296
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,923
What's your game, Mr Bond?

297
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,817
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.

298
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:59,175
A 1940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

299
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:02,551
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.

300
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,932
When the Nazis were on the run.

301
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,513
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.

302
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,081
Interesting.

303
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,020
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

304
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,337
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

305
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:20,591
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.

306
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,304
- It's worth £5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent. Hah!

307
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,910
Naturally.

308
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,255
Strict rules of golf?

309
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:39,917
But of course.

310
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:14,754
Oh, bad luck, You're in the rough.

311
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:26,010
Oh, what a pity. Here it is.

312
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,562
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1 .

313
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:34,353
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.
Five minutes are almost up.

314
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:36,497
A lost ball will cost you
stroke and distance.

315
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,727
Ah Ah!
Uh-huh.

316
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,929
I'm still training him as a caddy.

317
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,470
Successfully, too.

318
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:02,767
Slazenger No.1 .

319
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:04,288
Good.

320
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,754
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

321
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,909
It isn't.

322
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:14,021
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

323
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,266
Why, you crafty old... !

324
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,300
Leave it.

325
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:25,270
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.

326
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:28,661
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.

327
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,112
Like me to mark it or knock it in?

328
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:36,304
Play it.

329
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,160
- This for a half.
- That's right.

330
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:57,661
One to go, that will be the clincher.

331
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:58,442
Fine.

332
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,367
Did you switch 'em, sir?
Uh-huh.

333
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:06,484
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.

334
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:14,524
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.

335
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:42,656
Down in five.

336
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:44,966
I have to sink this to have the game,
right?

337
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,760
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!

338
00:30:57,976 --> 00:30:59,760
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

339
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:02,991
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

340
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,949
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

341
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:08,409
You must have played the wrong ball
on the 18th fairway.

342
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:10,370
We are playing strict rules, so

343
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,658
I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.

344
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,622
She's a beauty. Phantom IIl, '37, isn't she?

345
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,886
- You are clever resourceful man, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.

346
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:01,954
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths
have crossed. Let's leave it at that.

347
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,776
I should think our first meeting would have convinced you.

348
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,577
Oh, I see. You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

349
00:32:11,188 --> 00:32:14,183
Both of us know perfectly well
what we are talking about, Mr Bond.

350
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,915
But I see that it is necessary
to remind you.

351
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:17,951
Oddjob!

352
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,699
Many people have tried to involve
themselves in my affairs.

353
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:25,075
Unsuccessfully.

354
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,930
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

355
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:44,657
Oh, nothing, Mr Bond.

356
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:46,375
I own the club.

357
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:51,708
I assume you want the cheque
made out to cash.

358
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,972
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

359
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:00,469
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

360
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:05,093
Oh, I believe this is yours.

361
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,680
Can I have your attention, please?

362
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,270
British United Air Ferries
announce the final call

363
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,520
for the departure
of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

364
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,620
British United Air Ferries announce the
departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.

365
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:04,713
Mr Bond!

366
00:34:05,098 --> 00:34:08,563
That's alright, I've got you booked out on the
next flight to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.

367
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,716
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

368
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:31,472
Discipline, 007.

369
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,050
Discipline.

370
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:50,955
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.

371
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:54,484
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.

372
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,210
You should've pulled over further.

373
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,223
Look at them!

374
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:02,498
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.

375
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:06,901
- How could new tyres... ?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.

376
00:38:07,164 --> 00:38:09,518
Anyway, I'm so glad it's all the car and not you.

377
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:11,469
You don't look like the sort of girl
who should be ditched.

378
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,027
Never mind that.
Please take me to a garage.

379
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:15,027
Certainly.

380
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:18,898
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...

381
00:38:19,018 --> 00:38:20,409
As quickly as possible.

382
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:30,799
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

383
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,333
What's your name, by the way?

384
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,894
Soames. Tilly Soames.

385
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:46,005
Here for the hunting season?

386
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:48,910
I had a case just like that one.

387
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,015
It's for my ice skates.

388
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:56,493
Lovely sport.

389
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:01,448
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.

390
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,934
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.

391
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:07,075
There's a garage.

392
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:19,988
Fräulein!

393
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,158
I've had an accident.

394
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,814
How long will it take?

395
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,915
Thank you.

396
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:44,493
They say it'll take 24 hours to get
new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.

397
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:47,500
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.

398
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:49,928
I hate to leave you here alone.

399
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:51,879
I can take care of myself.

400
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:53,875
Yes, I'm sure you can.

401
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,842
Well... don't forget to write.

402
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:56,310
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.

403
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,071
And art requires...

404
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:04,268
In this case, the bodywork
of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.

405
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,620
We dismantle it here.

406
00:42:08,112 --> 00:42:12,750
Reduce the gold in this special furnace,
which in turn will give a smelt...

407
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,455
...weighing approximately two tons.

408
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,770
I make six trips a year to the Continent
in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.

409
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:24,373
It would be wiser to suspend
your other activities.

410
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:26,399
Now, Mr Ling, please assure your principals

411
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,507
Operation Grand Slam
will have my undivided attention...

412
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,244
There are certain matters we must discuss.

413
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,482
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

414
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,751
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!

415
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,471
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

416
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:41,799
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!

417
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:44,214
TM. Tilly Masterson.

418
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,619
I knew your sister Jill.
I know what he did to her in Miami.

419
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,216
No, you don't! Let me go!

420
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:52,986
- If you wanted to kill him, why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!

421
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:54,699
Well, you're a lousy shot.

422
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:57,053
But somebody else around here isn't.

423
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,172
Come on.

424
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:09,488
Quick, get in the car. I'll take care of him.

425
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:10,623
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

426
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:21,605
Now!

427
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,473
Good evening, 007.

428
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,665
My name is James Bond.

429
00:50:33,135 --> 00:50:36,591
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.

430
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,705
You have been recognised.

431
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,978
Let's say by one of your opposite
numbers, who is also licensed to kill.

432
00:50:44,522 --> 00:50:46,729
Oh, that interesting car of yours!

433
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:50,993
l, too, have a new toy, but

434
00:50:51,763 --> 00:50:53,378
considerably more practical.

435
00:50:53,828 --> 00:50:55,828
You are looking at an industrial laser,

436
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:59,535
which emits an extraordinary light,
not to be found in nature.

437
00:50:59,742 --> 00:51:02,030
It can project a spot on the moon.

438
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:07,441
Or at closer range, cut through
solid metal. I will show you.

439
00:51:35,164 --> 00:51:37,080
This is gold, Mr Bond.

440
00:51:38,507 --> 00:51:41,142
All my life,
I've been in love with its colour,

441
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:43,949
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

442
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,913
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock,

443
00:51:50,222 --> 00:51:51,452
which is considerable.

444
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,270
I think you've made your point.
Thank you for the demonstration.

445
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:02,521
Choose your next witticism carefully,
Mr Bond. It may be your last.

446
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,017
The purpose of our two encounters
is now very clear to me.

447
00:52:09,137 --> 00:52:12,295
I do not intend to be distracted
by another. Good night, Mr Bond.

448
00:52:15,197 --> 00:52:16,760
Do you expect me to talk?

449
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:20,180
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!

450
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:23,672
There is nothing you can talk to me about
that I don't already know.

451
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:38,660
You're forgetting one thing.

452
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:42,294
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

453
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:45,445
I trust he will be more successful.

454
00:52:50,222 --> 00:52:51,830
He knows what I know.

455
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,100
You know nothing, Mr Bond.

456
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:58,053
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

457
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:24,817
Two words you may have overheard

458
00:53:24,937 --> 00:53:29,770
which cannot have any significance
to you or anyone in your organisation.

459
00:53:30,352 --> 00:53:32,211
Can you afford to take that chance?

460
00:53:48,045 --> 00:53:49,689
You are quite right, Mr Bond.

461
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,876
You are worth more to me alive.

462
00:54:26,557 --> 00:54:27,421
Who are you?

463
00:54:28,454 --> 00:54:29,965
My name is Pussy Galore.

464
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:34,524
I must be dreaming.

465
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,659
I thought I'd wake up dead.

466
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:49,943
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.

467
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,240
I see.

468
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:57,472
I'm delighted to be here.

469
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,364
And, by the way, where is here?

470
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:05,544
35,000 feet flying southwest
over Newfoundland.

471
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,671
That explains the humming.

472
00:55:09,676 --> 00:55:13,849
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's
Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.

473
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:16,696
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.

474
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:20,152
I never realised he enjoyed
my company that much.

475
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:23,458
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

476
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:24,312
Mei-Lei.

477
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,208
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?

478
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:32,674
Just a drink.
A martini, shaken not stirred.

479
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:38,155
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

480
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:40,483
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.

481
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:42,645
You are?

482
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:45,556
And just how personal is that?

483
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:48,940
I'm a damn good pilot.

484
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:50,461
Period!

485
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,114
Well, that's good news. By the way,

486
00:55:52,234 --> 00:55:55,445
- Where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.

487
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:00,220
Thank you.

488
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,298
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

489
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:16,211
This should be a memorable flight.

490
00:56:17,347 --> 00:56:20,086
You can turn off the charm.
I'm immune.

491
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,469
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

492
00:56:38,589 --> 00:56:41,624
our port of entry into the United States,
in 55 minutes.

493
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:43,979
Mei-Lei.

494
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,440
I would like to arrive
more appropriately dressed.

495
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,957
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

496
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:55,292
And my attaché case?

497
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:59,433
Black attaché case damaged
when examined. So sorry.

498
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,565
Apologies quite unnecessary.

499
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:11,604
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

500
00:58:49,912 --> 00:58:51,811
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

501
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:54,579
Do you want to play it easy...
or the hard way?

502
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,615
And this isn't a tranquilliser.

503
00:58:56,735 --> 00:58:59,816
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

504
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:01,985
That's a Smith & Wesson .45.

505
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:05,973
If you fire this close, the bullet
will pass through me and the fuselage

506
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:07,607
like a blowtorch through butter.

507
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:12,062
The cabin will depressurize and we'll
be sucked into outer space together.

508
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:15,491
If that's how you want to arrive,
you're welcome.

509
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:17,569
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

510
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:18,932
That's very sensible.

511
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:21,768
And there's so much going on
around Mr Goldfinger,

512
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:25,690
I wouldn't dream of
not accepting his... hospitality.

513
00:59:26,404 --> 00:59:28,526
He'll be very glad to see you, too.

514
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,258
You like close shaves, don't you?

515
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,197
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.

516
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,285
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

517
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,876
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal

518
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:50,087
from Friendship Airport, Baltimore,
where he's just landed.

519
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:52,832
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

520
00:59:52,952 --> 00:59:54,513
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

521
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,780
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.

522
00:59:57,147 --> 00:59:59,532
Registered to our old friend
Auric Goldfinger.

523
00:59:59,652 --> 01:00:03,250
I'm glad he's making progress.
Keep an eye on him for us.

524
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,472
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky,
is their final destination.

525
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:09,118
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?

526
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,426
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

527
01:00:33,657 --> 01:00:35,580
-- Mr Bond.
- Of course.
- Please.

528
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:38,583
Any time.

529
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:41,700
Thank you.

530
01:00:54,161 --> 01:00:55,597
Do mind your step, Captain.

531
01:00:56,715 --> 01:00:58,442
Just keep playing it easy.

532
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:04,450
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr Goldfinger?

533
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:07,161
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.

534
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:29,396
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.

535
01:01:30,617 --> 01:01:31,361
Come on.

536
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,161
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

537
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:37,760
I believe the bourbon and branch water
is rather splendid here in Kentucky.

538
01:01:38,229 --> 01:01:41,462
Well, now that we're both off duty,
perhaps...

539
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,578
Manners, Oddjob.

540
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:52,090
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.

541
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:58,073
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.

542
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:44,754
Well?

543
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:47,355
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.

544
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:50,153
Your final briefing is tonight.
That'll be all for now.

545
01:03:22,525 --> 01:03:24,252
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.

546
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,459
Lovely animal, isn't she?

547
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:29,321
Certainly better bred than the owner.

548
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:31,922
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.

549
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:34,766
Felix!

550
01:04:38,229 --> 01:04:41,909
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.

551
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:49,915
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.

552
01:04:50,976 --> 01:04:53,380
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.

553
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:06,033
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole
in his shoes.

554
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,251
Yeah, I like this!

555
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:18,052
Gentlemen!

556
01:05:18,172 --> 01:05:18,918
Goldfinger

557
01:05:19,038 --> 01:05:20,450
why weren't we told
that New York and

558
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:21,770
the West Coast
were in on this?

559
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,124
Look who's talking!

560
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:25,680
I do not do business with Chicago.

561
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,334
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.

562
01:05:28,454 --> 01:05:31,098
Now I find I'm attending
a hoods' convention.

563
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:34,471
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

564
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:36,024
- I made a delivery, too.

565
01:05:36,144 --> 01:05:38,533
You all made the deliveries
we contracted for.

566
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:41,413
And you owe me one million bucks.

567
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,670
I owe each of you a million

568
01:05:44,684 --> 01:05:46,169
in gold bullion.

569
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:47,150
So, pay!

570
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:52,057
Gentlemen,
you can have the million today.

571
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,355
Or ten millions tomorrow.

572
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:58,735
Did you say ten million?

573
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:01,411
As soon as my bank opens
in the morning.

574
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:03,834
Banks don't open on Sunday.

575
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,633
My bank will.

576
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,039
What's with that trick pool table?

577
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:27,895
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.

578
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:30,641
Turn those lights back on!

579
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,956
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

580
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,536
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

581
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:45,102
I don't like being cooped up
like this. What's that map doing there?

582
01:06:55,582 --> 01:06:57,075
This is my bank.

583
01:06:57,836 --> 01:07:00,993
The gold depository at Fort Knox,
gentlemen.

584
01:07:01,566 --> 01:07:05,022
In its vaults are $15 billion dollars.

585
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,882
The entire gold supply

586
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:10,734
of the United States.

587
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:12,607
Knock off Fort Knox!

588
01:07:15,314 --> 01:07:17,859
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.

589
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:22,233
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

590
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,209
41,000.

591
01:07:24,472 --> 01:07:26,843
And who's gonna say boo to them,
Goldfinger?

592
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,664
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

593
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:33,919
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?

594
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,889
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

595
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,194
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

596
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:02,162
He has fired rockets to the moon.

597
01:08:02,879 --> 01:08:03,957
Split the atom.

598
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:05,561
Achieved miracles

599
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:09,846
in every field of human endeavour...
except crime!

600
01:10:15,116 --> 01:10:18,008
The underworld will rock
with applause for centuries!

601
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:20,225
- Cut the commercial!
- Yeah, get to the point!

602
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:23,322
You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.
The depository's impregnable.

603
01:10:23,442 --> 01:10:27,939
- Look, the joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!

604
01:10:28,059 --> 01:10:30,816
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.

605
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:34,869
Larger, better protected perhaps,
but nonetheless a bank!

606
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:37,677
It can be... I think the expression is

607
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:38,804
blown.

608
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:42,058
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!

609
01:10:42,744 --> 01:10:45,100
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

610
01:10:45,712 --> 01:10:48,689
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

611
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:52,328
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

612
01:10:52,826 --> 01:10:55,175
Every eventuality has been considered.

613
01:10:55,295 --> 01:10:57,800
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

614
01:10:58,336 --> 01:10:59,759
Your organisation, Mr Midnight,

615
01:10:59,879 --> 01:11:03,732
brought a batch of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

616
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:06,102
They contain Delta 9.

617
01:11:06,222 --> 01:11:09,611
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas

618
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:16,093
which disperses 15 minutes after
inducing complete... unconsciousness

619
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:18,613
for 24 hours.

620
01:11:20,463 --> 01:11:21,759
Tomorrow at dawn,

621
01:11:22,914 --> 01:11:26,121
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

622
01:11:26,647 --> 01:11:29,855
will spray it into the atmosphere.

623
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:35,637
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilised

624
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,188
my task force,
which Mr Strap and his people

625
01:11:39,308 --> 01:11:41,432
smuggled across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,

626
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,957
will approach Fort Knox
in motorised equipment

627
01:11:46,077 --> 01:11:49,714
along Bullion Boulevard,
which runs past the depository here

628
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,442
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

629
01:11:53,737 --> 01:11:56,733
This fence surrounding the depository,

630
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:59,860
as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.

631
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:02,259
It will be dynamited!

632
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:06,414
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

633
01:12:06,534 --> 01:12:08,144
How, may I ask?

634
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:14,225
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By arranging through
your considerable influence in shipping circles

635
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:15,982
to bring through customs uninspected

636
01:12:16,102 --> 01:12:18,921
a consignment labelled machine parts.

637
01:12:19,454 --> 01:12:23,669
All that will then remain is to descend
to the vaults where the bullion is stored.

638
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:25,755
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

639
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:29,743
If you have no objection...
I'll take my money now.

640
01:12:29,863 --> 01:12:32,680
What's the matter, Solo?
Too big for you to handle?

641
01:12:40,608 --> 01:12:43,124
Gentlemen, we must respect Mr Solo's decision.

642
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:45,906
Please excuse me for a few
minutes while I take care of him.

643
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:47,681
Make yourselves comfortable.

644
01:13:04,354 --> 01:13:07,180
- How do we get it out?
- That's the bit I wanna hear!

645
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,580
Yeah, it'd better be good!

646
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:23,061
Pussy!

647
01:13:24,553 --> 01:13:26,262
Who taught you judo?

648
01:13:26,638 --> 01:13:27,906
The gun you took.

649
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:32,387
The gun.

650
01:13:33,975 --> 01:13:35,308
The gun, of course.

651
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:48,066
We must have a few
fast falls together some time.

652
01:14:05,555 --> 01:14:08,250
Hey, Strap!
He's got the right answers.

653
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,722
You and me don't even have to be there.
The boys can handle everything.

654
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:21,228
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!

655
01:14:22,248 --> 01:14:24,624
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?

656
01:14:30,272 --> 01:14:31,314
The gas!

657
01:14:56,332 --> 01:15:00,388
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr Solo. However...

658
01:15:05,566 --> 01:15:08,582
Mr Bond, I thought
you were resting in your quarters.

659
01:15:08,702 --> 01:15:12,233
They are delightful.
But it's much too nice to stay indoors.

660
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:15,707
I ran into Miss Galore
and she suggested that we join you.

661
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,788
Mr Solo, Mr Bond.
Another of my distinguished guests.

662
01:15:19,908 --> 01:15:21,976
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?

663
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:27,055
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

664
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:29,598
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

665
01:15:29,718 --> 01:15:32,066
My plane will get you
to New York on time

666
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:34,144
with your excess luggage.

667
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:36,548
Allow me.

668
01:15:38,429 --> 01:15:41,950
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.
You will be at the airport in a few minutes.

669
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:45,553
Goodbye, Mr Solo.
Some other time, perhaps?

670
01:15:45,769 --> 01:15:47,112
Happy landings, old boy.

671
01:15:53,818 --> 01:15:55,489
I found him under the model.

672
01:15:57,741 --> 01:16:01,450
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

673
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,549
So did I.

674
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:26,121
He's on the move.

675
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:52,909
Slow down, don't crowd him.

676
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,379
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn!

677
01:17:44,491 --> 01:17:46,726
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.

678
01:18:02,213 --> 01:18:04,514
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

679
01:18:04,634 --> 01:18:06,784
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

680
01:20:16,726 --> 01:20:17,374
Dead.

681
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:20,552
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.

682
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:21,968
Why would he do that?

683
01:20:24,966 --> 01:20:27,731
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.

684
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:47,963
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will
make you a very rich woman, my dear.

685
01:20:48,698 --> 01:20:50,905
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?

686
01:20:52,558 --> 01:20:54,464
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

687
01:20:54,949 --> 01:20:57,747
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

688
01:20:58,249 --> 01:21:01,348
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",

689
01:21:01,907 --> 01:21:03,241
and go back to nature.

690
01:21:06,259 --> 01:21:09,414
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.

691
01:21:10,527 --> 01:21:12,827
Touts looking for racing tips.

692
01:21:17,759 --> 01:21:19,637
There's another possibility, however.

693
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,489
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.

694
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:24,547
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life
in Switzerland,

695
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:26,303
if those gentlemen are his friends.

696
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:29,055
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

697
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,554
For their benefit, Pussy,
let's make him as happy as possible.

698
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:39,250
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

699
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:40,740
Certainly.

700
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:43,440
Business before pleasure.

701
01:22:03,766 --> 01:22:04,743
He wants you.

702
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:16,596
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.

703
01:22:16,838 --> 01:22:17,833
Mint julep?

704
01:22:18,582 --> 01:22:21,383
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

705
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,710
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

706
01:22:26,481 --> 01:22:28,058
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

707
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,991
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

708
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:33,927
And incidentally
Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

709
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:38,191
You are unusually well informed,
Mr Bond.

710
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,613
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

711
01:22:41,067 --> 01:22:43,884
Ha! American motorists
kill that many every two years.

712
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,962
Yes, well... I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

713
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:50,144
$15 billion dollars

714
01:22:50,454 --> 01:22:54,271
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

715
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:59,377
60 men would take 12 days
to load it onto 200 trucks.

716
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:02,297
At the most, you'll have two hours

717
01:23:02,417 --> 01:23:06,109
before the army, navy, air force, marines
move in and make you put it back.

718
01:23:07,347 --> 01:23:09,516
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

719
01:23:14,242 --> 01:23:15,885
Is the julep tart enough for you?

720
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:19,632
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank

721
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,489
but not to steal anything.

722
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,439
Why?

723
01:23:25,035 --> 01:23:26,104
Go on, Mr Bond.

724
01:23:26,224 --> 01:23:29,040
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory?

725
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,394
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...

726
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:38,480
But of course!
His government's given you a bomb.

727
01:23:39,031 --> 01:23:41,060
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

728
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,728
It's small but particularly dirty.

729
01:23:43,848 --> 01:23:46,196
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.

730
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:49,049
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the...

731
01:23:50,758 --> 01:23:54,580
...entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for...

732
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:57,556
...57 years.

733
01:23:57,923 --> 01:23:59,340
58, to be exact.

734
01:24:00,192 --> 01:24:04,059
I apologise, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.

735
01:24:04,179 --> 01:24:07,466
They get what they want -
economic chaos in the West.

736
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:10,701
And the value of your gold
increases many times.

737
01:24:11,022 --> 01:24:14,618
I conservatively estimate... ten times.

738
01:24:15,144 --> 01:24:16,027
Brilliant.

739
01:24:17,911 --> 01:24:20,672
But the atomic device, as you call it,

740
01:24:21,945 --> 01:24:24,424
is already, obviously, in this country.

741
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:25,827
Obviously.

742
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:30,896
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

743
01:24:31,473 --> 01:24:33,141
could be risky. Very risky.

744
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:36,247
On the contrary, Mr Bond.
The risk is all on your side.

745
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:39,714
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,

746
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:41,608
who knows where
it might be exploded?

747
01:24:42,146 --> 01:24:44,371
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens
at New London,

748
01:24:46,465 --> 01:24:47,461
Cape Kennedy,

749
01:24:48,921 --> 01:24:50,022
near the White House.

750
01:24:50,142 --> 01:24:54,301
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

751
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:56,449
You will be there to see for yourself.

752
01:24:56,878 --> 01:24:58,765
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

753
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:11,901
Forgive me, Mr Bond,

754
01:25:12,021 --> 01:25:15,300
but I must arrange
to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.

755
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:19,528
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

756
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:23,490
Very chic, Miss Galore.
Don't you agree?

757
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:25,681
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.

758
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:27,425
I'll join you both later.

759
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:35,572
Well, how about it, handsome?

760
01:25:35,813 --> 01:25:38,292
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

761
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:40,782
Well, the new Miss Galore.

762
01:25:41,007 --> 01:25:43,665
Where do you hide your gold knuckles
in this outfit?

763
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:47,304
I never carry weapons
after business hours.

764
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,574
So you're off duty?

765
01:25:50,006 --> 01:25:51,771
I'm completely defenceless.

766
01:25:54,118 --> 01:25:55,198
So am I.

767
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,221
That's my James!

768
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,427
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

769
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:08,042
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

770
01:26:08,776 --> 01:26:10,691
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

771
01:26:13,285 --> 01:26:14,770
He's quite mad, you know.

772
01:26:17,133 --> 01:26:19,621
Well, now. What do we have here?

773
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:24,444
007 seems to have the situation
well in hand.

774
01:26:25,575 --> 01:26:27,856
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

775
01:26:28,121 --> 01:26:31,558
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.

776
01:26:32,117 --> 01:26:35,234
I'd like to think
you're not in all of this... caper.

777
01:26:35,808 --> 01:26:38,362
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

778
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:41,898
What would it take
for you to see things my way?

779
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,404
A lot more than you've got.

780
01:26:45,183 --> 01:26:47,690
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

781
01:26:50,608 --> 01:26:53,988
Isn't it customary to grant the
condemned man his last request?

782
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:55,838
You've asked for this.

783
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,033
Get up!

784
01:27:06,274 --> 01:27:07,223
Certainly.

785
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:25,160
There.

786
01:27:26,133 --> 01:27:27,560
Now let's both play.

787
01:27:56,165 --> 01:27:58,412
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

788
01:27:58,532 --> 01:28:00,908
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!

789
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:25,432
Speed: 220.

790
01:28:25,698 --> 01:28:27,905
Wind check: westerly.

791
01:28:40,303 --> 01:28:44,321
Champagne leader to Champagne
section. Commence dive... now.

792
01:28:53,422 --> 01:28:55,112
Ready for Rockabye Baby.

793
01:28:55,392 --> 01:28:57,420
Commence spray on countdown.

794
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,135
Five,

795
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:02,487
four, three, two,

796
01:29:02,928 --> 01:29:03,689
zero.

797
01:30:48,603 --> 01:30:51,242
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.

798
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,021
The baby is asleep.

799
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:56,963
I repeat, the baby is asleep.
We're going home now.

800
01:30:57,436 --> 01:30:58,112
Out.

801
01:35:26,669 --> 01:35:27,864
Good morning, Mr Bond.

802
01:35:27,984 --> 01:35:30,191
For once,
you are exactly where I want you.

803
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,114
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.

804
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:44,117
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.

805
01:36:44,769 --> 01:36:48,062
Minimum offensive fire until I signal
bomb has been neutralised.

806
01:36:48,182 --> 01:36:52,117
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralised.

807
01:36:52,367 --> 01:36:54,809
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.

808
01:37:29,321 --> 01:37:30,466
Goodbye, Mr Bond.

809
01:38:05,536 --> 01:38:07,667
Mr Ling, it is merely a matter of timing and...

810
01:38:40,888 --> 01:38:42,364
He's one of them, so is the girl.

811
01:38:42,484 --> 01:38:44,295
I'll get her, you get the door open.

812
01:38:58,531 --> 01:38:59,829
We're trapped!

813
01:38:59,949 --> 01:39:02,550
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.

814
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:05,817
Don't be a fool!

815
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:08,048
You can be a hero, I'm not!

816
01:39:11,368 --> 01:39:12,796
No, no, no!

817
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:36,379
Get going! Hurry up!

818
01:44:56,989 --> 01:44:58,012
What kept you?

819
01:44:59,182 --> 01:45:01,379
You OK, James?
Where's your butler friend?

820
01:45:02,105 --> 01:45:03,457
Oh, he blew a fuse.

821
01:45:04,629 --> 01:45:07,250
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger
would've hit the jackpot.

822
01:45:08,303 --> 01:45:10,466
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.

823
01:45:10,586 --> 01:45:13,544
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.

824
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,023
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

825
01:45:19,046 --> 01:45:21,318
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

826
01:45:29,657 --> 01:45:32,277
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.

827
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,726
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?

828
01:45:35,972 --> 01:45:38,019
The President wants
to thank you personally.

829
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:41,739
- Aw, it was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.

830
01:45:42,733 --> 01:45:44,724
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.

831
01:45:44,844 --> 01:45:47,090
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

832
01:45:47,422 --> 01:45:50,015
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.

833
01:45:50,135 --> 01:45:52,078
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.

834
01:45:52,322 --> 01:45:54,003
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.

835
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:28,488
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.

836
01:46:29,222 --> 01:46:32,255
Well, congratulations
on your promotion, Goldfinger.

837
01:46:33,391 --> 01:46:37,860
- Are you having lunch at the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.

838
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:42,087
And you have interfered with my plans
for the last time, Mr Bond.

839
01:46:42,869 --> 01:46:47,038
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

840
01:46:48,243 --> 01:46:51,240
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.

841
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,346
At the moment she is where she ought to be...
at the controls.

842
01:47:41,181 --> 01:47:41,979
Pussy!

843
01:47:43,899 --> 01:47:46,951
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.

844
01:47:50,265 --> 01:47:51,458
It's no good.

845
01:48:26,557 --> 01:48:27,796
Oh, no, you don't!

846
01:48:29,412 --> 01:48:31,102
This is no time to be rescued.
