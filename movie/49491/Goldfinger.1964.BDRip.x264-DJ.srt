1
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,352
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

2
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,147
Mr. Ramirez and his friends
will be out of business.

3
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,693
At least he won't be using heroin-flavored
bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,446
Don't go back to your hotel, señor.

5
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,864
They'll be watching it.

6
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,825
There's a plane leaving
for Miami in an hour.

7
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,202
I'll be on it,

8
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,413
but first I have some
unfinished business to attend to.

9
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,893
Forgive me.

10
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,145
Why do you always wear that thing?

11
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,981
I have a slight inferiority complex.

12
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,609
Where was I? Yes.

13
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,249
Shocking.

14
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,547
Positively shocking.

15
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,120
How's this?

16
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,665
That's nice. Very nice.

17
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,166
Just here?

18
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,918
No, a little lower, darling.

19
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,546
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

20
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,466
Felix! Felix, how are you?

21
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,593
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello.

22
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,679
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.

23
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,305
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

24
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,057
Man talk.

25
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,231
You must be slipping, 007, letting
the opposition get that close to you.

26
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,400
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica,
didn't they?

27
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,402
But what's on your mind? I'm on holiday.

28
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,529
Not anymore, you're not.
Signal from London.

29
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,072
Might have known M
wouldn't book me into

30
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,658
the best hotel in Miami Beach
out of pure gratitude.

31
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,160
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

32
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,912
Auric Goldfinger.

33
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,581
Sounds like a French nail varnish.

34
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,916
He's British, but he doesn't sound like it.

35
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,211
Big operator. Worldwide interests,
all apparently quite reputable.

36
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,088
Owns one of the finest
stud farms in the States.

37
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,881
What's the tie-up with Washington?

38
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,009
He's clean, as far as CIA is concerned.

39
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,052
And where do I find him?

40
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,979
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

41
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,731
Goldfinger's been taking him
to the cleaners

42
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,608
every day for a week.

43
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,988
Morning, Mr. Simmons.
Ready for our little game?

44
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,156
Sure, I'm ready.

45
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,407
When you're 10 grand in the hole,

46
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,950
you're ready for anything.

47
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,286
Could I have my usual seat?

48
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,163
You and your sun tan.

49
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,415
That Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

50
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,875
Same stakes?

51
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,544
Let's double it. $5 a point.

52
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,090
Did you say five?

53
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,509
My luck's got to change sometime.

54
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,927
Okay.

55
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,598
I'll get back to the office
and cable M you're on the job.

56
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,974
You can fill me in on the rest at dinner.

57
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,101
Fine, I'll call you later.

58
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,912
- Four.
- So soon?

59
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:10,418
- How many?
- 7, 12, 18, 32, 44.

60
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,221
Miss?

61
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,557
Hey, what do you...

62
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,185
That's Mr. Goldfinger's suite.

63
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,687
Yes, I know.

64
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,565
You're very sweet.

65
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,864
He just drew the king of clubs.

66
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,908
That makes his count 59.

67
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,121
He's got a diamond run, eight, nine, ten.

68
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,457
He's holding on to the six of spades,

69
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,668
so I guess he thinks you want it.

70
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,212
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

71
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,882
He needs kings and queens.

72
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,637
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.

73
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,360
Come on, come on.

74
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,405
That's more like it.

75
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,617
- What's your name?
- Jill.

76
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,537
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.

77
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,916
Tell me, Jill, why does he do it?

78
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,668
He likes to win.

79
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,336
Why do you do it?

80
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,172
He pays me.

81
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,257
Is that all he pays you for?

82
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,426
And for being seen with him.

83
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,679
- Just seen?
- Just seen.

84
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,182
I'm so glad.

85
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,312
You're much too nice

86
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,398
to be mixed up in anything like this,
you know.

87
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,446
Now hear this, Goldfinger.

88
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,740
Your luck has just changed.

89
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,700
I doubt very much if
the Miami Beach police

90
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,411
would take kindly to what you're doing.

91
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,123
Nod your head if you agree.

92
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,750
Nod!

93
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,504
Good. Now start losing, Goldfinger.

94
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,049
Shall we say, $10,000?

95
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,844
No, let's be generous. Let's make it 15,000.

96
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,724
May I see?

97
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,400
Well, I can see this is really my day.

98
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,402
Gin.

99
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,662
Over and out.

100
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,541
That should keep him occupied
for quite some time.

101
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,751
I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Bond.

102
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,170
Call me James.

103
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,924
More than anyone I've met
in a long time, James.

104
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,886
What on earth
are we going to do about it?

105
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,513
Yes, what?

106
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,266
- I'll tell you at dinner.
- Where?

107
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,394
I know the best place in town.

108
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,834
Station W.E.B.S. brings you
the latest in world news.

109
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,212
Washington.
At the White House this afternoon,

110
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,340
the President said
he was entirely satisfied...

111
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,138
That makes two of us.

112
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,813
- Hello.
- Leiter here.

113
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,648
- Felix.
- Well, now?

114
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,026
What's that? Dinner?

115
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,571
No. Look, I'm sorry. I can't.

116
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,072
Something big's come up.

117
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,365
Right...

118
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,994
- How about breakfast?
- Okay.

119
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,247
- Not too early.
- I'll call you around 9:00.

120
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,916
Yes, 9:00 will be fine.

121
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,959
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.

122
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,556
It's lost its chill.

123
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,770
Why, you...

124
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,522
it's all right, there's another in the fridge.

125
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,649
Who needs it?

126
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,276
My dear girl, there are some things
that just aren't done,

127
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,154
such as drinking Dom Perignon '53

128
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,449
above a temperature of
38 degrees Fahrenheit.

129
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,702
That's as bad as listening to
the Beatles without earmuffs.

130
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,207
Now, where is this passion juice?

131
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,746
Jill?

132
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,789
Yes, Mr. Bond?

133
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,084
Beach 79432, room 119.

134
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,634
Hello?

135
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,262
Hello, Felix? Get over here right away.

136
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,265
- What's up?
- The girl's dead.

137
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,516
Dink?

138
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,727
No. Masterson, Jill Masterson,

139
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,104
and she's covered in paint.

140
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,731
Gold paint.

141
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,119
Gold? All over?

142
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,413
She died of skin suffocation.

143
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,999
It's been known to happen
to cabaret dancers.

144
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,251
It's all right
so long as you leave a small bare patch

145
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,004
at the base of the spine
to allow the skin to breathe.

146
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,589
Someone obviously didn't.

147
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,257
And I know who.

148
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,098
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

149
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,642
It's an assignment, like any other

150
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,270
and if you can't treat it as such,
coldly and objectively,

151
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,356
008 can replace you.

152
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,777
You've hardly distinguished yourself,
have you?

153
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,072
You were supposed to observe
Mr. Goldfinger, not borrow his girlfriend.

154
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,074
Instead of that,
Goldfinger goes off to Europe,

155
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,493
and it's only by the grace of God,
your friend Leiter,

156
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,787
and my intervention with
the British embassy in Washington,

157
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,206
that you're not in the custody
of the Miami Beach police.

158
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,917
Sir, I'm aware of my shortcomings,

159
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,378
but I'm prepared to
continue this assignment

160
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,797
in the spirit you suggest,

161
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,007
if I knew what it was about.

162
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,343
Sir.

163
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,555
What do you know about gold?
Not paint, bullion.

164
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,224
I know it when I see it.

165
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,644
Meet me here at 7:00. Black tie.

166
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,990
Now, what do you know
about gold, Moneypenny?

167
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,826
The only gold I know about
is the kind you wear.

168
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,287
You know,
on the third finger of your left hand.

169
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,415
One of these days
we really must look into that.

170
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,499
What about tonight?

171
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,751
You'll come around for dinner,

172
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,462
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

173
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,089
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,

174
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,593
but unfortunately I do have
a business appointment.

175
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,221
That's the flimsiest excuse
you've ever given me.

176
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,391
Some girls have all the luck.

177
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,475
Who is she, James?

178
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,727
She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

179
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,397
and kindly omit the
customary by-play with 007.

180
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,941
He's dining with me,
and I don't want him to be late.

181
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,195
So there's hope for me yet.

182
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,200
Moneypenny, won't you ever believe me?

183
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,205
We here at the Bank of England, Mr. Bond,

184
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,832
are the official depository for gold bullion

185
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,211
just as Fort Knox, Kentucky,
is for the United States.

186
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,046
We know, of course,
the amounts we each hold,

187
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,173
we know the amounts
deposited in other banks,

188
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,134
and we can estimate
what is being held for industrial purposes.

189
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,720
This enables the two governments
to establish, respectively,

190
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,056
the true value of the dollar and the pound.

191
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,143
Consequently, we are vitally concerned
with unauthorized leakages.

192
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,395
I take it you mean smuggling?

193
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,647
Yes.

194
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:37,068
Gold, gentlemen,
which can be melted down and recast,

195
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,819
is virtually untraceable,

196
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,822
which makes it, unlike diamonds,
ideal for smuggling,

197
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,325
attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.

198
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,160
Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.

199
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,787
Thank you, sir.

200
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,749
Have a little more of this
rather disappointing brandy.

201
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,125
What's the matter with it?

202
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,338
I'd say it was a 30-year-old fine
indifferently blended, sir...

203
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,424
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

204
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,427
Colonel Smithers is
giving the lecture, 007.

205
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,391
Gentlemen, Mr. Goldfinger
has gold bullion on deposit

206
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,143
in Zurich, Amsterdam,
Caracas, and Hong Kong.

207
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,438
Worth 20 million pounds.
Most of it came from this country.

208
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,898
Why move it?

209
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,109
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country.

210
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,652
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,

211
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,863
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

212
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,240
and triple your money.

213
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,368
Providing, of course, you have
the facilities for melting it down.

214
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,494
And has he?

215
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,912
Apart from being
a legitimate bullion dealer,

216
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,914
Mr. Goldfinger poses...

217
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
No, that's not quite fair.

218
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,921
Is, among his many other interests,
a legitimate international jeweler.

219
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,464
He's legally entitled

220
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,634
to operate modest
metallurgical installations.

221
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,511
His British one is down in Kent.

222
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,473
As yet, we have failed to discover
how he transfers his gold overseas.

223
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,392
And Lord knows we've tried.

224
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,062
If your department can establish
that it is done illegally,

225
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,731
then the bank could institute proceedings

226
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,316
to recover the bulk of his holdings.

227
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,319
I think it's time Mr. Goldfinger and I met.

228
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,903
Socially, of course.

229
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,406
I was hoping you'd say that.

230
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,992
It might lead to a business talk,

231
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,827
Mr. Goldfinger's kind of business.

232
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,203
I'll need some sort of bait.

233
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,456
I quite agree. This is the only one we have

234
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,291
from the Nazi hoard
at the bottom of Lake Toplitz

235
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,834
in the Salzkammergut.

236
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,211
But there are undoubtedly others.

237
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,049
Mr. Bond can make
whatever use of it he thinks fit,

238
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,009
providing he returns it, of course.

239
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,595
It's worth £5,000.

240
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,977
You'll draw it from Q branch with
the rest of your equipment in the morning.

241
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,395
Of course, sir.

242
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,828
Morning, Q.

243
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,539
Good morning, 007. This way, please.

244
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,876
My, we are busy this morning.

245
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,592
It's not perfected yet.

246
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,388
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.

247
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,391
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.

248
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,937
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5,
with modifications.

249
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,981
Now, pay attention, please.

250
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,234
Windscreen, bulletproof.

251
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,820
As are the side and the rear windows.

252
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,073
Revolving number plates, naturally.

253
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,200
Valid all countries.

254
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,579
Here's a nice little
transmitting device called a homer.

255
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,374
You prime it by pressing
that back like this.

256
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,961
You see? The smaller model
is now standard field issue,

257
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,380
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

258
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,507
Its larger brother is magnetic.

259
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,592
Right.

260
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,678
To be concealed in the car you're trailing

261
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,013
while you keep out of sight.

262
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,726
Reception on the dashboard here.

263
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,648
Auto-visual. Range, 150 miles.

264
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,192
Ingenious. And useful, too.

265
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,320
Allow a man to stop off
for a quick one en route.

266
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,282
It has not been perfected
after years of patient research

267
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,617
entirely for that purpose, 007.

268
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,705
And incidentally,
we'd appreciate its return,

269
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,874
along with all your other equipment,

270
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,668
intact, for once,
when you return from the field.

271
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,794
You'd be surprised

272
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,590
the amount of wear and tear
that goes on out there in the field.

273
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,716
Anything else?

274
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,676
I won't keep you
for more than an hour or so,

275
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,678
if you give me your undivided attention.

276
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:36,015
We've installed some
rather interesting modifications.

277
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,767
You see this arm here?

278
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,397
Now, open the top, and inside are
your defense mechanism controls.

279
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,735
Smoke screen, oil slick,
rear bulletproof screen,

280
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,654
and left and right
front-wing machine guns.

281
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,073
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.

282
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,742
You see the gear lever here?

283
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,494
Now, if you take the top off,

284
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,829
you'll find a little red button.

285
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,957
Whatever you do, don't touch it.

286
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,125
And why not?

287
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,503
'Cause you'll release
this section of the roof

288
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,881
and engage and then fire
the passenger ejector seat.

289
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,259
Ejector seat? You're joking.

290
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,471
I never joke about my work, 007.

291
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,353
Ready, Blacking?

292
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,731
Yes, sir.
There's an old member dropped by, sir.

293
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:29,068
Same handicap as yours,
I wondered if you'd rather play with him.

294
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,361
Where is he?

295
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,946
- Mr. Bond?
- Yes?

296
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,323
This is Mr. Goldfinger.

297
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,955
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

298
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,084
You can go straight off,
the first tee is clear.

299
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,628
- Fine.
- I'll get Hawker to carry for you, Mr. Bond.

300
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,754
That'll be splendid.

301
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,172
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

302
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,676
I'll take some tees.

303
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,177
Yes, of course.

304
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,725
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr. Bond.

305
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,270
He's an admirable manservant, but mute.

306
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,230
He's not a very good caddie.

307
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,900
Golf is not yet
the national game of Korea, hey?

308
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,498
This meeting is not a coincidence?

309
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,419
What's your game, Mr. Bond?

310
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,174
My game?

311
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,261
You didn't come here to play golf.

312
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,618
The 1940 smelt from
the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

313
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,952
Part of a smelt of 600.

314
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,704
They vanished in 1944.

315
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,706
When the Nazis were on the run.

316
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,166
And you have access to more?

317
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,335
Yes, from the same source.

318
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,836
Interesting.

319
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,298
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.

320
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,593
Then you have no objection
to increasing the stakes?

321
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,595
No, what do you have in mind?

322
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,556
The bar of gold
you have with you, naturally.

323
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,559
It's worth £5,000.

324
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,062
I'll stake the cash equivalent.

325
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,231
Naturally.

326
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,988
Strict rules of golf?

327
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,533
But of course.

328
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,276
Bad luck. You're in the rough.

329
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,746
What a pity. Here it is.

330
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,624
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

331
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,253
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.

332
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,587
Five minutes are almost up.

333
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,757
A lost ball will cost you
a stroke and distance.

334
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,651
I'm still training him as a caddie.

335
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,155
Successfully, too.

336
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,993
- Slazenger Number 1?
- Good.

337
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,248
If that's his original ball,
I'm Arnold Palmer.

338
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,833
It isn't.

339
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,128
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.

340
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,048
Why, you crafty old...

341
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,592
Leave it.

342
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,470
The ball you found, sir?

343
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,346
Yes, Slazenger 7.

344
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,476
Let's have a little fun with Mr. Goldfinger.

345
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,607
Would you like me
to mark it or knock it in?

346
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,983
Play it.

347
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,862
- This for a half.
- That's right.

348
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,962
One to go. That'll be the clincher.

349
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,130
Fine.

350
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,883
Did you switch them, sir?

351
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,136
Then we've got him.

352
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,555
If he doesn't notice the switch.

353
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,313
- It's your honor, sir!
- It's all right.

354
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,174
Down in five.

355
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,177
I have to sink this
to halve the game, right?

356
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,892
You win, Goldfinger.

357
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,186
It seems I'm too good for you.

358
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,316
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

359
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,486
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.

360
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,572
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

361
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,700
You must have played the wrong ball
somewhere on the 18th fairway.

362
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,535
We are playing strict rules,

363
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,454
so I'm afraid you lose
the hole and the match.

364
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,787
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

365
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,123
You are a clever,
resourceful man, Mr. Bond.

366
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,207
Why, thank you.

367
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,919
Perhaps too clever.
Twice our paths have crossed,

368
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,670
let's leave it at that.

369
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,423
I should think our first meeting
would have convinced you.

370
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,799
I see.

371
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,345
You're worried about me
not giving you a return game.

372
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,764
Both of us know perfectly well

373
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,891
what we're talking about, Mr. Bond.

374
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,393
But I see that
it is necessary to remind you.

375
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,728
Oddjob!

376
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,941
Many people have tried
to involve themselves

377
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,193
in my affairs, unsuccessfully.

378
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,378
Remarkable. But what does
the club secretary have to say?

379
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,463
Nothing, Mr. Bond.

380
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,048
I own the club.

381
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,178
I assume you want
the check made out to cash?

382
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,806
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

383
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,187
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

384
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,400
I believe this is yours.

385
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,229
May I have your attention, please?

386
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:48,066
British United Air Ferries
announcing final call

387
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,988
for the departure of their
DS-400 flight to Geneva.

388
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,413
British United Air Ferries
announce the departure

389
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,208
of their DS-400 flight to Geneva.

390
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,293
Mr. Bond?

391
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,502
That's all right, I've got you booked out

392
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,713
on the next flight to Geneva
leaving in half an hour.

393
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,132
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.

394
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,921
Discipline, 007.

395
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,383
Discipline.

396
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,934
Are you all right?

397
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,187
Here, let me help you.
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

398
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,689
No thanks to you.

399
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,942
You should have pulled over further.

400
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,236
Look at them!

401
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,822
A double blowout.
I've never seen one of these before.

402
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,782
How could new tires...

403
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,159
Defect of some kind, most likely.

404
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,662
Anyway, I'm so glad
it's only the car and not you.

405
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,664
You don't look like the sort of girl
who should be ditched.

406
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,292
Never mind that.
Please take me to the nearest garage.

407
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,170
Certainly. By the way, my name is Bond...

408
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,673
As quickly as possible.

409
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,559
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.

410
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,900
What's your name, by the way?

411
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,820
Soames. Tilly Soames.

412
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,741
Here for the hunting season?

413
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,910
I had a case just like that one.

414
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,707
It's for my ice skates.

415
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,084
Lovely sport.

416
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,423
- Where do you skate?
- St. Moritz.

417
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,135
I didn't know there was ice there
this time of the year.

418
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,261
There's a garage.

419
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,276
I've had an accident.

420
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,083
How long will it take? Thank you.

421
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,506
They say it will take
24 hours to get new tires.

422
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,673
There's a hotel nearby.

423
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,883
Jump in. I'll run you down.

424
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,885
That won't be necessary.

425
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,638
I hate to leave you here alone.

426
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,556
I can take care of myself.

427
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,558
Yes, I'm sure you can.

428
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,977
Well, don't forget to write.

429
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,514
Smuggling is an art, Mr. Ling.

430
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,349
And art requires...

431
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,603
In this case,
the bodywork of my Rolls Royce

432
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,313
is 18-carat gold.

433
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,108
We dismantle it here,

434
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,945
reduce the gold in
this special furnace to ingots,

435
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,783
which in turn will be released on the board
and weigh approximately two tons.

436
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,578
I make six trips a year to the continent

437
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,455
in the Rolls Royce, Mr. Ling.

438
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,458
It would be wiser
to suspend your other activities.

439
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,460
Now, Mr. Ling,
please assure your principals

440
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,421
Operation Grand Slam will have
my undivided attention.

441
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,299
Now, there are certain matters
we must discuss.

442
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,485
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

443
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,571
What the hell are you doing here?

444
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,989
I want to kill him!

445
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,699
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.

446
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,783
I want him alive.

447
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,620
I want him dead. He killed my sister.

448
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,663
T.M. Tilly Masterson.

449
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,415
I knew your sister, Jill.

450
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,541
I know what he did to her in Miami.

451
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,543
No, you don't. Let me go!

452
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,462
If you wanted to kill him,
why did you shoot at me?

453
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,213
I didn't. I was shooting at him.

454
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,798
You're a lousy shot.

455
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,594
Somebody else around here isn't.
Come on.

456
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,105
Quick. Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

457
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,268
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

458
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,196
Now!

459
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,774
Good evening, 007.

460
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,194
My name is James Bond.

461
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,783
And members of your curious profession
are few in number.

462
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,328
You have been recognized,

463
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,539
let's say, by one of
your opposite numbers,

464
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,583
who is also licensed to kill.

465
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,918
That interesting car of yours!

466
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,631
I, too, have a new toy,

467
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,800
but considerably more practical.

468
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,219
You are looking at an industrial laser

469
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,723
which emits an extraordinary light
not to be found in nature.

470
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,225
It can project a spot on the moon,

471
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:07,605
or at closer range cut through solid metal.

472
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,148
I will show you.

473
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,302
This is gold, Mr. Bond.

474
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:42,598
All my life, I've been in love with its color,

475
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,351
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

476
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,022
I welcome any enterprise
that will increase my stock.

477
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,192
Which is considerable.

478
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,448
I think you've made your point, Goldfinger.
Thank you for the demonstration.

479
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,118
Choose your next
witticism carefully, Mr. Bond.

480
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,953
It may be your last.

481
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,874
The purpose of
our two previous encounters

482
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,292
is now very clear to me.

483
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,128
I do not intend
to be distracted by another.

484
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,879
Good night, Mr. Bond.

485
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,467
Do you expect me to talk?

486
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,637
No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.

487
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,222
There is nothing you can talk to me about

488
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,266
that I don't already know.

489
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,823
You're forgetting one thing.

490
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,492
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

491
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,745
I trust he will be more successful.

492
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,002
But he knows what I know.

493
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,087
You know nothing, Mr. Bond.

494
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,717
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

495
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,993
Two words you may have overheard,

496
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,038
which cannot possibly have
any significance to you

497
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,457
or anyone in your organization.

498
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,959
Can you afford to take that chance?

499
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,935
You are quite right, Mr. Bond.

500
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,312
You are worth more to me alive.

501
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,014
Who are you?

502
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,517
My name is Pussy Galore.

503
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,272
I must be dreaming.

504
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,867
I thought I'd wake up dead.

505
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,495
Tranquilizer gun. Knock-out shot.

506
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,746
I see.

507
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,252
I'm delighted to be here.

508
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,716
And by the way, where is here?

509
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,927
35,000 feet,
flying southwest over Newfoundland.

510
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,639
That explains the humming.

511
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,808
The humming means
you're in Mr. Goldfinger's

512
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,185
Lockheed Jetstar heading for Baltimore,

513
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,645
and you're his guest.

514
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,063
I'm honored.

515
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,567
I never realized he enjoyed
my company that much.

516
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,528
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

517
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,113
Mei-lei.

518
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,575
Can I do something for you, Mr. Bond?

519
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,453
Just a drink. A martini.

520
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,330
Shaken, not stirred.

521
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,460
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.

522
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,046
I'm Mr. Goldfinger's personal pilot.

523
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,506
You are?

524
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,925
And just how personal is that?

525
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,722
I'm a damned good pilot. Period.

526
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,349
Well, that's good news.

527
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,601
By the way, where is our host?

528
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,311
He flew on ahead.

529
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,732
Thank you.

530
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,616
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

531
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,915
This should be a memorable flight.

532
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,668
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.

533
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,561
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

534
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,313
our port of entry into the United States,

535
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,981
in 55 minutes.

536
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:49,488
Mei-Lei, I would
like to arrive more appropriately dressed.

537
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,408
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

538
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,328
And my attaché case?

539
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,540
Black attaché case damaged
when examined.

540
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,874
So sorry.

541
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,252
Apology is quite unnecessary.

542
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,178
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei
to keep an eye on him.

543
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,861
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

544
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,781
Do you want to play it easy
or the hard way?

545
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,533
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

546
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:01,119
Now, Pussy, you know
a lot more about planes than guns.

547
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,372
That's a Smith and Wesson .45,

548
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,082
and if you fired at this close range,

549
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,209
the bullet will pass through me
and the fuselage

550
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,419
like a blowtorch through butter.

551
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,629
The cabin will depressurize,

552
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,757
and we'll both be sucked
into outer space together.

553
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,385
But if that's how you want to enter
the United States, you're welcome.

554
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,762
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

555
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,972
That's very sensible.

556
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,141
Besides, there's always
so much going on around Mr. Goldfinger.

557
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,812
I wouldn't dream
of not accepting his hospitality.

558
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,773
He'll be glad to see you, too.

559
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,943
You like close shaves, don't you?

560
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,618
Washington, sir, on the green scrambler.

561
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,579
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.

562
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,621
Leiter!

563
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:48,000
It's about 007, sir.
We picked up his homer signal.

564
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,294
It's monitored into
Friendship Airport, Baltimore,

565
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,378
where he's just landed.

566
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,922
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

567
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,757
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

568
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,176
He came in on a private jet, ex-Geneva,

569
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,637
registered to our old friend,
Auric Goldfinger.

570
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,015
- I'm glad he's making progress.
- Yes, sir.

571
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,391
Keep an eye on him for us.

572
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,603
Their flight plan gives Blue Grass Field,
Kentucky, as their final destination.

573
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,397
Don't charge in on him
and spoil anything, will you?

574
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,065
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

575
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,215
- Mr. Bond, please.
- Of course.

576
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,926
Any time.

577
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,096
Thank you.

578
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,736
Do mind your step, Captain.

579
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,946
Just keep playing it easy.

580
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,702
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's
all right with Mr. Goldfinger?

581
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,081
- Of course.
- And I'll see the supplies are here soon.

582
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,642
Talented chaps.

583
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,061
They should be. I trained them.

584
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,938
Come on.

585
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,357
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

586
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,818
I believe that the bourbon
and branch water's rather splendid

587
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,528
here in Kentucky.

588
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,781
Well, now that
we're both off duty, perhaps...

589
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,706
Manners, Oddjob.

590
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,792
I thought you always
took your hat off to a lady.

591
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:57,671
You know, he kills little girls like you.

592
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,423
Little boys, too.

593
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:46,428
- Well?
- Dress rehearsal

594
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,804
went like a dream, Skipper.

595
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,140
Good. You'll get your final briefing tonight.

596
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,142
That'll be all for now.

597
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:25,258
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr. Bond.

598
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,011
Lovely animal, isn't she?

599
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,847
Certainly better bred than the owner.

600
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,558
Show Mr. Bond to his quarters, please.

601
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,288
Felix?

602
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,543
Maybe we should just drop in on him.

603
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:42,794
He'll shout if he needs us.

604
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,052
They're all here, Mr. Goldfinger.

605
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,638
Yes. Yes.

606
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,181
Thank you, Kisch.

607
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,777
That guy Solo's going to wear
a hole in his shoes.

608
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,493
I like this!

609
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:19,080
- Wait!
- Gentlemen!

610
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,248
Goldfinger,

611
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,918
why weren't we told that New York
and the West Coast were in on this?

612
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,419
Look who's talking.

613
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,796
I do not do business with Chicago.

614
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,466
I thought we had
a private business deal to settle.

615
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,093
Now I find I'm attending
a hood's convention.

616
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,597
Goldfinger, I made a delivery.
Where is my money?

617
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,140
I made a delivery, too.

618
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,768
You all made the deliveries
we contracted for.

619
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:42,354
And you owe me one million bucks.

620
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:47,317
I owe each of you a million in gold bullion.

621
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,736
So pay!

622
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:53,156
Gentlemen, you can have
the million today...

623
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,744
Or 10 millions tomorrow.

624
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,038
Did you say 10 million?

625
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,666
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

626
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,834
Banks don't open on Sunday.

627
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,045
My bank will.

628
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,721
What's with that trick pool table?

629
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:27,816
Cover him!

630
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,235
Cover those doors!

631
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,612
Turn those lights back on!

632
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,407
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

633
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,076
There's no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

634
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:44,499
I don't like being cooped up like this.

635
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,002
What's that map doing there?

636
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,263
This is my bank,

637
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:02,600
the gold depository
at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

638
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,104
In its vaults are $15 billion,

639
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:11,776
the entire gold supply
of the United States.

640
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:13,945
Knock off Fort Knox?

641
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,284
- Got a key or something?
- Of a kind.

642
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,288
There are 35,000 troops
stationed around there!

643
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,540
41,000.

644
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,793
And who's going to
say boo to them, Goldfinger?

645
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,587
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Hey, what is this?

646
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:31,963
The floor!

647
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,300
What is this, a merry-go-round?

648
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,489
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

649
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,242
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

650
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,870
He has fired rockets to the moon,

651
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,121
split the atom,

652
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:09,167
achieved miracles
in every field of human endeavor

653
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,002
except crime!

654
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:19,214
The underworld will rock
with applause for centuries.

655
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,424
- Cut the commercial.
- Yeah, get to the point.

656
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:22,717
You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.

657
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,385
The depository is impregnable.

658
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,513
Look, the joint is bombproof,
electrified, lousy with...

659
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,098
Bear with me, please!

660
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:32,060
Fort Knox is a bank, like any other.

661
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,895
Larger, better-protected perhaps,

662
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,231
but, nonetheless, a bank.

663
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:39,734
It can be, I think the expression is, blown.

664
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,780
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen.

665
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:46,574
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

666
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,827
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

667
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,957
Every detail has been
scrupulously prepared.

668
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,376
Every eventuality has been considered.

669
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,128
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

670
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,798
Your organization, Mr. Midnight,
brought the consignment

671
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,842
of these canisters
across the Canadian border.

672
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,262
They contain Delta 9.

673
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,471
- Delta 9?
- What's that?

674
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:13,309
An invisible nerve gas
which disperses 15 minutes

675
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:19,565
after inducing complete
unconsciousness for 24 hours.

676
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,945
Tomorrow at dawn,

677
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:27,782
the flying circus of my personal pilot,
Miss Pussy Galore,

678
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,702
will spray it into the atmosphere.

679
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:37,250
Once the population, including
the military, has been immobilized,

680
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,751
my task force,

681
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,461
which Mr. Strap had his people

682
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,047
smuggle across
the Rio Grande from Mexico,

683
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,135
will approach Fort Knox
in motorized equipment

684
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:48,678
along Bullion Boulevard

685
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:51,222
which runs past the depository here,

686
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,891
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

687
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,979
This fence surrounding the depository,

688
01:11:58,063 --> 01:12:01,357
as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.

689
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,776
It will be dynamited.

690
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,655
My task force will then move
to the main entrance and demolish it.

691
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,157
How, may I ask?

692
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,201
You made that possible, Mr. Solo,

693
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,288
by arranging through your
considerable influence in shipping circles

694
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,165
to bring through customs uninspected

695
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:20,418
a consignment labeled "machine parts".

696
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:23,421
All that will then remain is
to descend to the vaults,

697
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,214
where the bullion is stored.

698
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,758
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.

699
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:30,970
If you have no objection,
I'll take my money now.

700
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,307
What's the matter, Solo,
too big for you to handle?

701
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,442
Gentlemen, we must respect
Mr. Solo's decision.

702
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,362
Please excuse me for a few minutes
while I take care of him.

703
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:49,572
Make yourselves comfortable.

704
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:09,634
- How do we get it out?
- That's the bit I want to hear.

705
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:24,440
Pussy.

706
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,443
Who taught you judo?

707
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,487
The gun you took.

708
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,075
The gun.

709
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,702
The gun, of course.

710
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:49,841
We must have a few fast falls
together sometime.

711
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:09,444
Hey, Strap, if he's got the right answers,

712
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:11,446
you and me don't even have to be there.

713
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,406
The boys can handle everything.

714
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,956
Hey, they closed up the fireplace.

715
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,249
What's going on?

716
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,625
- I don't like this.
- What the...

717
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,294
What's going on here?

718
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,550
The gas!

719
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,661
Such a pity you did not choose to remain
with the others, Mr. Solo.

720
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,079
However...

721
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,754
Mr. Bond, I thought you were resting
in your quarters.

722
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,508
They are delightful,
but it's much too nice to stay indoors.

723
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:17,261
I ran into Miss Galore,
and she suggested that we join you.

724
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,514
Mr. Solo, Mr. Bond,

725
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,557
- another of my distinguished guests.
- Hello.

726
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,392
Leaving us so soon, Mr. Solo?

727
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,394
Unfortunately,
he has a pressing engagement.

728
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,147
Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

729
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,190
Boy!

730
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,816
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

731
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,486
My plane will get you
to New York on time...

732
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,404
With your excess luggage.

733
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,949
Allow me.

734
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,327
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.

735
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,955
You'll be at the airport in a few minutes.

736
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,749
Goodbye, Mr. Solo.
Some other time, perhaps.

737
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,626
Happy landings, old boy.

738
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,884
I found him under the model.

739
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:02,431
Operation Grand Slam.
I did enjoy your briefing.

740
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,979
So did I.

741
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,790
He's on the move!

742
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:54,275
Slow down. Don't crowd him.

743
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,045
Are you blind or something?
You missed the turn.

744
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,745
They've turned to the right
just ahead here somewhere.

745
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,846
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

746
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,766
Ten will get you one,
it's a drink or a dame.

747
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:20,397
- Dead.
- Mechanical failure, maybe.

748
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:23,692
- Unless he switched it off.
- Why would he do that?

749
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,447
Drive to the farm. It's all we can do.

750
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,698
Right.

751
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,336
Thank you.

752
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,757
Your share of Operation Grand Slam

753
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,593
will make you a very rich woman, my dear.

754
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,721
Why else would I be in it, Mr. Goldfinger?

755
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:56,183
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

756
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,228
No, I've spotted a little island
in the Bahamas.

757
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,940
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing",

758
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,984
and go back to nature.

759
01:21:07,445 --> 01:21:08,696
Yes, Kisch?

760
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,532
Two men in a car with binoculars.

761
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,826
Touts looking for racing tips.

762
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,000
There's another possibility, however.

763
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,002
Kisch, ask Mr. Bond to join us.

764
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:25,546
We were quite right to spare
Mr. Bond's life in Switzerland

765
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,798
if those gentlemen are his friends.

766
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,718
Let's convince them
he needs no assistance.

767
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:33,721
For their benefit, Pussy,

768
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:36,307
let's make him as happy as possible.

769
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,394
I suggest you change
into something more suitable.

770
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:42,438
Certainly.

771
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,982
Business before pleasure.

772
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,378
He wants you.

773
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,433
Mr. Bond. Sit down, please. Mint julep?

774
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,603
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.

775
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:25,189
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

776
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,693
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

777
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,196
You know Operation Grand Slam
simply won't work.

778
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,199
And incidentally, Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

779
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:39,536
You are unusually well-informed,
Mr. Bond.

780
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,081
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

781
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,668
American motorists kill
that many every two years.

782
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:49,421
Yes, I've worked out
a few statistics of my own.

783
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:55,427
$15 billion
in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

784
01:22:55,512 --> 01:23:00,474
60 men would take
12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.

785
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,102
Now, at the most,
you're gonna have two hours

786
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:05,688
before the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Marines move in

787
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:07,815
and make you put it back.

788
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,193
Who mentioned anything
about removing it?

789
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,282
The julep tart enough for you?

790
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,327
You plan to break into
the world's largest bank,

791
01:23:21,037 --> 01:23:23,080
but not to steal anything?

792
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:24,873
Why?

793
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,292
Go on, Mr. Bond.

794
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:30,170
Mr. Ling,
the red Chinese agent at the factory,

795
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,798
he's a specialist in nuclear fission.

796
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,844
But of course!

797
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,097
His government's given you a bomb.

798
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,099
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

799
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,560
It's small, but particularly dirty.

800
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,520
Cobalt and iodine?

801
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:47,896
Precisely.

802
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:50,691
If you explode it in Fort Knox,

803
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:56,071
the entire gold supply of the United States
will be radioactive for

804
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,532
57 years.

805
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,492
58, to be exact.

806
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:05,205
I apologize, Goldfinger.
It's an inspired deal.

807
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,625
They get what they want,
economic chaos in the West,

808
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,920
and the value of your gold
increases many times.

809
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,382
I conservatively estimate 10 times.

810
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:17,384
Brilliant.

811
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:21,930
But the atomic device, as you call it,

812
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:25,642
is already obviously in this country.

813
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:27,352
Obviously.

814
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:31,982
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

815
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,193
could be risky, very risky.

816
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:37,196
On the contrary, Mr. Bond,
the risk is all on your side.

817
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,866
If the authorities
should attempt to locate it,

818
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,077
who knows where it might
be exploded?

819
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:46,080
Perhaps the Polaris
submarine pens at New London,

820
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,374
Cape Kennedy,

821
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,251
near the White House.

822
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:55,506
But we are speculating idly.
Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

823
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,092
You will be there to see for yourself.

824
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,469
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

825
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:14,983
Forgive me, Mr. Bond,
but I must arrange to separate my gold

826
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,944
from the late Mr. Solo.

827
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,697
As you said,
he had a pressing engagement.

828
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,701
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?

829
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,745
Please entertain Mr. Bond for me, Pussy.

830
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,997
I'll join you both later.

831
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,880
Well, how about it, handsome?

832
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:40,134
Don't you think it's time
we got to know each other socially?

833
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,052
Well, the new Miss Galore.

834
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,888
Where do you hide
your gold knuckles in this outfit?

835
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,016
I never carry weapons
after business hours.

836
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,019
Yeah? So you're off duty.

837
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:53,105
I'm completely defenseless.

838
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:56,358
So am I.

839
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,575
That's my James.

840
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,535
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

841
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:09,079
Yes. I'm glad you're enjoying it.

842
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:12,583
Too bad it all has to end
tomorrow morning.

843
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,295
He's quite mad, you know.

844
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,591
Well, now, what do we have here?

845
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,596
007 seems to have
the situation well in hand.

846
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,974
Come on, I'm bushed.
Let's get back to the motel.

847
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,684
You're quite a girl, Pussy.

848
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,978
I'm strictly the outdoor type.

849
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,356
I'd like to think you're
not in all of this caper.

850
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,484
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

851
01:26:40,236 --> 01:26:43,280
What would it take for you
to see things my way?

852
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,616
A lot more than you've got.

853
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,369
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.

854
01:26:51,664 --> 01:26:52,706
Isn't it customary

855
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,375
to grant a condemned man
his last request?

856
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,336
You've asked for this.

857
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,469
Get up.

858
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,555
Certainly.

859
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,076
There. Now, let's both play.

860
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,439
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

861
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,191
Commence Rock-a-bye Baby.

862
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,567
Good luck.

863
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,800
Speed, 220.

864
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:28,844
Wind check, westerly.

865
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:43,525
Champagne leader to Champagne section.

866
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:45,235
Commence dive now.

867
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,496
Ready for Rock-a-bye Baby.

868
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,665
Commence spray on countdown.

869
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,500
Five,

870
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:03,420
four, three, two,

871
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,088
zero.

872
01:30:49,652 --> 01:30:52,612
Champagne leader
to Grand Slam task force leader.

873
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,947
The baby is asleep.

874
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:56,783
I repeat, the baby is asleep.

875
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:59,202
We're going home now. Out.

876
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,349
Chafoo.

877
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,139
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

878
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,933
For once, you're exactly where I want you.

879
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:42,295
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, brigadier.

880
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:43,463
Right, Jack. Move in.

881
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:45,590
Move in, commando tactics.

882
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:49,010
Minimum offensive fire
until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

883
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,720
- Minimum offensive fire...
- Come on.

884
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,139
...until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

885
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:55,642
Bomb disposal unit to accompany dog.

886
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:31,886
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

887
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,631
Mr. Ling, it is merely a matter of timing...

888
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:36,993
Goldfinger!

889
01:38:38,495 --> 01:38:40,246
Please, Mr. Gold...

890
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,125
He's one of them! So's the girl! I'll get her!

891
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:45,960
You get the door open!

892
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,728
We're trapped. The bomb.
I'll take the fuse out.

893
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:07,065
Don't be a fool.

894
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:09,233
You can be a hero. I'm not!

895
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,489
No! No!

896
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,812
Come on, you boys! Get going! Hurry up!

897
01:44:58,083 --> 01:44:59,542
What kept you?

898
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:03,087
You okay, James?
Where's your butler friend?

899
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,756
He blew a fuse.

900
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:09,135
Three more ticks and
Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot.

901
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:10,303
Did you get him?

902
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,722
- Not yet, but he won't get far.
- And Pussy?

903
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,807
She helped us
switch the gas in the canisters.

904
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,601
By the way,
what made her call Washington?

905
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:22,898
I must have appealed
to her maternal instincts.

906
01:45:30,782 --> 01:45:34,118
Come on, James. Get aboard.
You can't keep the President waiting.

907
01:45:34,202 --> 01:45:36,871
Special plane, lunch at the White House.
How come?

908
01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:39,457
The President wants
to thank you personally.

909
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:41,083
It was nothing, really.

910
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,294
I know that, but he doesn't.

911
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:46,255
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here?

912
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,382
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

913
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:49,508
Who are the other two?

914
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,093
There are no other two.

915
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,304
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long, James. Good luck.

916
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:55,181
- Thank you, brigadier.
- Good luck.

917
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:29,965
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr. Bond.

918
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,594
Congratulations on your promotion,
Goldfinger.

919
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:36,514
Are you having lunch
at the White House, too?

920
01:46:36,598 --> 01:46:39,225
In two hours, I shall be in Cuba.

921
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:43,729
And you have interfered
with my plans for the last time, Mr. Bond.

922
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:46,148
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.

923
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,651
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

924
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:50,444
By the way, where is she?

925
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:52,363
I will deal with her later.

926
01:46:52,447 --> 01:46:55,658
At the moment, she is
where she ought to be. At the controls.

927
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:43,414
Pussy.

928
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,542
What happened? Where's Goldfinger?

929
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:48,294
Playing his golden harp.

930
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:52,381
It's no good!

931
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:28,667
No, you don't.

932
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,464
This is no time to be rescued.
