00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,140
拉米雷斯和他的朋友们要失业了
Mr. Ramirez and his friends will be out of business.

3
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,690
至少他不会再用海洛因口味的香蕉去支援革命了
At least he won't be using heroin-flavored bananas to finance revolutions.

4
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,440
你不要回酒店去
Don't go back to your hotel, se?or.

5
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,860
他们会监视那里

6
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,820
一小时后有一班飞机去迈阿密

8
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,410
但现在我要先去办一些之前没做完的事

9
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,890
对不起
Forgive me.

10
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,140
你为什么总带着那东西
Why do you always wear that thing?

11
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,980
我有些轻微的自卑情结
I have a slight inferiority complex.

12
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,610
我在哪里呢 对了
Where was I? Yes.

13
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,240
真可怕
Shocking.

14
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,540
太可怕了
Positively shocking.

不 亲爱的 再低点
No, a little lower, darling.

28
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,540
我在一双纤纤玉手之下找到你了
I thought I'd find you in good hands.

29
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,460
菲利克斯 你好啊

丁克 和菲利克斯说再见吧
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.

33
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,050
我们要谈公事
Man talk.

34
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,230
让对手离你这么近 007 你一定是松懈了
You must be slipping, 007, letting the opposition get that close to you.

35
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,400
他们在牙买加离我更近 不是吗
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica, didn't they?

36
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,400
- 你是怎么想的 - 我在度假
-But what's on your mind? -I'm on holiday.

37
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,520
不再是了 假期结束了 伦敦有消息来
Not anymore, you're not. Signal from London.

38
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,070
我就知道M给我订迈阿密海滩最好的酒店
Might have known M wouldn't book me into

39
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,650
不会是单纯的要向我表达感谢
the best hotel in Miami Beach out of pure gratitude.

40
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,160
他让我们替你盯着他
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.

41
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,910
奥瑞克・金手指
Auric Goldfinger.

42
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,580
听起来像一种法国指甲油
Sounds like a French nail varnish.

43
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,910
他是英国人 但口音听起来不像
He's British, but he doesn't sound like it.

44
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,210
大企业家 生意遍布全球 看起来名声好像不错
Big operator. Worldwide interests, all apparently quite reputable.

45
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,080
他有一个全美国最好的马场
Owns one of the finest stud farms in the States.

46
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,880
这和华盛顿有什么关系
What's the tie-up with Washington?

47
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,000
中央情报局认为他没问题
He's clean, as far as CIA is concerned.

48
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,050
我在哪能找到他
And where do I find him?

49
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,980
那是个正在等他的傻瓜
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.

50
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
在这一整个星期里 金手指每天都在赢他
Goldfinger's been taking him to the cleaners every day for a week.

51
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,980
早上好啊 西蒙斯 准备好了吗
Morning, Mr. Simmons. Ready for our little game?

52
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,150
是的 我准备好了
Sure, I'm ready.

53
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,400
当你输掉一万美元的时候
When you're 10 grand in the hole,

54
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,950
你会准备好去干任何事
you're ready for anything.

55
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,280
我能坐我的老位子吗
Could I have my usual seat?

56
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,160
你想晒太阳
You and your suntan.

57
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,410
金手指是一位杰出的玩牌高手
That Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.

58
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,870
同样的赌注吗
Same stakes?

59
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,540
加倍 一分5美元
Let's double it. $5 a point.

60
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,090
你是说5美元吗
Did you say five?

61
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,510
我的好运总会来的
My luck's got to change sometime.

62
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
好吧
Okay.

63
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,590
我回去会发电报给M 说你已经开始工作了
I'll get back to the office and cable M you're on the job.

64
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,970
其他的资料晚饭的时候再给我吧
You can fill me in on the rest at dinner.

65
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,100
好的 晚上我会给你打电话
Fine, I'll call you later.

66
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,910
- 4 - 这也太快了吧
- Four. - So soon?

67
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,450
多少分
How many?

68
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,410
7 12 18 32 44
Seven, 12, 18, 32, 44.

69
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,220
小姐
Miss?

70
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,550
嘿 你在干什么
Hey, what do you...

71
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,180
这是金手指先生的套房
That's Mr. Goldfinger's suite.

72
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,680
是的 我知道

73
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,560
你很漂亮
You're very sweet.

74
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,860
他刚拿到了一张梅花K
He just drew the king of clubs.

75
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,900
现在他有59分了
That makes his count 59.

76
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,120
他有红心同花顺 8 9 10
He's got a diamond run, eight, nine, ten.

77
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,450
他手上留着一张黑桃6
He's holding on to the six of spades,

78
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,660
所以我猜他觉得你会要
so I guess he thinks you want it.

79
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,210
上一张牌是红桃8
That last draw was the eight of hearts.

80
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
他现在需要K和Q
He needs kings and queens.

81
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,630
- 你是谁 - 邦德 詹姆斯・邦德

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,400
嗯 这才像话

告诉我 吉儿 他为什么要这么做
Tell me, Jill, why does he do it?

87
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,660
他喜欢赢
He likes to win.

88
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,330
你为什么这么做
Why do you do it?

89
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,170
他付我钱
He pays me.

90
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,250
他只请你做这个吗
Is that all he pays you for?

91
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,420
还有和他一起露面
And for being seen with him.

92
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,680
- 只是露面吗 - 只是露面

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,310
你人很好
You're much too nice

95
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,390
不应该卷到这种事情里来
to be mixed up in anything like this, you know.

96
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,440
现在听着 金手指
Now hear this, Goldfinger.

97
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,740
你的运气变了
Your luck has just changed.

98
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,700
我非常怀疑迈阿密警方
I doubt very much if the Miami Beach police

99
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,410
会因为你做的这些事来问候你
would take kindly to what you're doing.

100
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
如果你同意我的话就点头
Nod your head if you agree.

101
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,750
点头
Nod!

102
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,500
很好 金手指 现在开始输
Good. Now start losing, Goldfinger.

103
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,040
输一万怎么样
Shall we say, $10,000?

104
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,840
不 我们大方点 输一万五好了
No, let's be generous. Let's make it 15,000.

105
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
我能看看吗
May I see?

106
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,400
今天我的运气很好
Well, I can see this is really my day.

107
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,400
金手指

通话完毕
Over and out.

109
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,540
这个足够让他忙上一阵子了
That should keep him occupied for quite some time.

110
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,750
邦德先生 我开始喜欢你了
I'm beginning to like you, Mr. Bond.

111

叫我詹姆斯
Call me James.

112
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,920
比我见过的其他人都要喜欢 詹姆斯
More than anyone I've met in a long time, James.

113
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,880
对于这一点 我们要做点什么
What on earth are we going to do about it?

114
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,510
是啊 做点什么呢
Yes, what?

115
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,260
- 晚饭的时候我会告诉你 - 去哪

116

138
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,700
和不带耳机去听披头士乐队的歌一样糟糕
That's as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs.

139
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,200
让我看看 热情的饮料在哪呢
Now, where is this passion juice?

140
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,740
吉儿
Jill?

141
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,790
喂 邦德先生
Yes, Mr. Bond?

142
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,080
请接79432海滩 119号房
Beach 79432, room 119.

143
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,630
喂
Hello?

144
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,260
喂 菲利克斯 马上到这来
Hello, Felix? Get over here right away.

145
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,260
- 怎么了 - 那女孩死了
- What's up? - The girl's dead.

146
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,510
是丁克吗
Dink?

147
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,720
不 是麦斯特森 吉儿・麦斯特森
No. Masterson, Jill Masterson,

148
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,100
身上被涂满了颜料
and she's covered in paint.

149
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,730
金色的颜料
Gold paint.

150
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,120
金色的 全身吗
Gold? All over?

151
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,410
她因为皮肤窒息而死
She died of skin suffocation.

152
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,000
这种事之前在舞蹈演员的身上发生过
It's been known to happen to cabaret dancers.

153
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,250
只要在脊柱上留一块地方
It's all right so long as you leave a small bare patch

154
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,000
让皮肤能够呼吸 就不会有事
at the base of the spine to allow the skin to breathe.

155
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,590
很显然有人没这么做
Someone obviously didn't.

156
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,250
我知道是谁
And I know who.

157
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,090
这不是私人恩怨 007
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.

158
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,640
这是个任务 和其他的任务一样
It's an assignment, like any other

159
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,270
如果你不能冷静客观的处理
and if you can't treat it as such, coldly and objectively,

160
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,350
008可以接替你
008 can replace you.

161
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,770
你总是看不清自己 对吗
You've hardly distinguished yourself, have you?

162
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,070
你应该去监视金手指先生 而不是去借用他的女朋友
You were supposed to observe Mr. Goldfinger, not borrow his girlfriend.

163
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,070
但是现在金手指去了欧洲
Instead of that, Goldfinger goes off to Europe,

164
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,490
而你是因为我和英国大使馆出面干涉
and it's only by the grace of God, your friend Leiter,

165
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,780
还有你的朋友莱特费了很大劲去帮助我们
and my intervention with the British embassy in Washington,

166
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,200
才没有被迈阿密警方关进监狱
that you're not in the custody of the Miami Beach police.

167
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,910
长官 我知道自己的缺点
Sir, I'm aware of my shortcomings,

168
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,370
我准备在你的指示下
but I'm prepared to continue this assignment

169
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,790
完成这项任务
in the spirit you suggest,

170
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,000
如果我知道这是怎么回事的话
if I knew what it was about.

171
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,340
长官
Sir.

172
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,550
你对黄金了解多少 不是颜料 是金条
What do you know about gold? Not paint, bullion.

173
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,220
见到的时候我就会了解
I know it when I see it.

174
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,640
7点来这里见我 穿礼服
Meet me here at 7:00. Black tie.

175
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,990
钱班霓 你对黄金了解多少
Now, what do you know about gold, Moneypenny?

176
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,820
对于黄金嘛 我只知道你戴的那种
The only gold I know about is the kind you wear.

177
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,280
在左手第三根手指上带着的那种
You know, on the third finger of your left hand.

178
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,410
总有一天 我们要深入的了解一下
One of these days we really must look into that.

179
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
今天晚上怎么样
What about tonight?

180
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,750
你到我那吃饭
You'll come around for dinner,

181
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,460
我给你烤蛋糕吃
and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.

182
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,090
没有什么能比这更让我高兴的了
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,

183
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,590
真的很不巧 今天晚上我刚好有个任务
but unfortunately I do have a business appointment.

184
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,220
这是你说过的最差的借口
That's the flimsiest excuse you've ever given me.

185
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,390
别的女孩就有这种运气
Some girls have all the luck.

186
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,470
她是谁 詹姆斯
Who is she, James?

187
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,720
"她"就是我 钱班霓小姐
She is me, Miss Moneypenny,

188
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,390
不要再和007打情骂俏了
and kindly omit the customary by-play with 007.

189
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,940
他会和我一起吃晚饭 我不想让他迟到
He's dining with me, and I don't want him to be late.

190
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,190
那我还是有希望的了
So there's hope for me yet.

191
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,200
钱班霓 你什么时候能相信我呢
Moneypenny, won't you ever believe me?

192
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,200
邦德先生 现在我们在英格兰银行
We here at the Bank of England, Mr. Bond,

193
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,830
这是我们国家存放金条的地方
are the official depository for gold bullion

194
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,210
就像美国肯塔基州的诺克斯堡一样
just as Fort Knox, Kentucky, is for the United States.

195
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,040
当然了 我们互相知道对方有多少黄金储备
We know, of course, the amounts we each hold,

196
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,170
也知道存放在其他银行的黄金有多少
we know the amounts deposited in other banks,

197
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,130
还能估算出工业界黄金的存量有多少
and we can estimate what is being held for industrial purposes.

198
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,720
这样就可以让我们两国的政府各自确定
This enables the two governments to establish, respectively,

199
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,050
美元和英镑的价值
the true value of the dollar and the pound.

200
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,140
所以 我们特别关心黄金未经许可流入市场
Consequently, we are vitally concerned with unauthorized leakages.

201
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,390
你指的是走私吗
I take it you mean smuggling?

202
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,640
是的
Yes.

203
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,060
先生们 黄金可以被熔化 也可以被重铸
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted down and recast,

204
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,820
不会留下痕迹
is virtually untraceable,

205
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,820
这让黄金和钻石不同 能成为理想的走私物品
which makes it, unlike diamonds, ideal for smuggling,

206
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,320
这就吸引了很多势力强大 头脑聪明的走私犯
attracting the biggest and most ingenious criminals.

207
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,160
谢谢你 布伦斯基尔 这样就行了
Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.

208
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,780
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

209
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,750
再来点让人欲罢不能的白兰地吧
Have a little more of this rather disappointing brandy.

210
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,120
这酒有什么特别的吗
What's the matter with it?

211
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,330
这是窖藏30年的酒 搅拌不均匀 先生
I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine, indifferently blended, sir...

212
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,420
加了很多香料
With an overdose of Bons Bois.

213
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,420
史密斯先生正在和你说话呢
Colonel Smithers is giving the lecture, 007.

214
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,390
先生们 金手指在苏黎世 阿姆斯特丹
Gentlemen, Mr. Goldfinger has gold bullion on deposit

215
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,140
加拉加斯和香港都存有金条
in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas, and Hong Kong.

216
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,430
价值两千万英镑 大多数来自于英国
Worth 20 million pounds. Most of it came from this country.

217
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,890
为什么要提走
Why move it?

218
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,100
因为各个国家的黄金的价格不同
Because the price of gold varies from country to country.

219
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,650
如果你在这里以30美元一盎司买入
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce,

220
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,860
你可以在巴基斯坦以110美元卖掉
you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110

221
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,240
价格翻了3倍
and triple your money.

222
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
当然了 你必须得有设备先去把它熔掉
Providing, of course, you have the facilities for melting it down.

223
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,490
金手指有吗
And has he?

224
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,910
金手指是一个合法的黄金商人
Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer,

225
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,910
所以他有
Mr. Goldfinger poses...

226
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,040
不 这不公平
No, that's not quite fair.

227
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,920
在他的众多生意中 他是一名合法的国际珠宝商
Is, among his many other interests, a legitimate international jeweler.

228
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,460
他得到合法授权
He's legally entitled

229
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,630
可以操作一定范围之内的冶金装置
to operate modest metallurgical installations.

230
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,510
他的在英国的工厂就在肯特
His British one is down in Kent.

231
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,470
目前为止我们还没有查出他是如何把黄金运到国外去的
As yet, we have failed to discover how he transfers his gold overseas.

232
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,390
财政大臣知道我们已经尽力了
And Lord knows we've tried.

233
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,060
如果你的部门能查出金手指的这些行违法
If your department can establish that it is done illegally,

234
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,730
那么银行就可以开始着手
then the bank could institute proceedings

235
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,310
调查他所持有的黄金
to recover the bulk of his holdings.

236
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,310
我想现在该是我和他见面的时候了
I think it's time Mr. Goldfinger and I met.

237
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,900
现在是时候了
Socially, of course.

238
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,400
我正等着你这么说呢
I was hoping you'd say that.

239
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,990
或许要进行一场商务会谈
It might lead to a business talk,

240
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,820
金手指先生的生意
Mr. Goldfinger's kind of business.

241
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,200
我需要诱饵
I'll need some sort of bait.

242
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,450
我非常同意 这是我们在纳粹的秘密基地
I quite agree. This is the only one we have

243
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,290
附近的托普利策湖的湖底找到的
from the Nazi hoard at the bottom of Lake Toplitz

244
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,830
只有这一块
in the Salzkammergut.

245
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,210
当然那里还有别的
But there are undoubtedly others.

246
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,040
邦德先生可以在需要的时候自由的使用它
Mr. Bond can make whatever use of it he thinks fit,

247
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,010
当然了 这个需要归还
providing he returns it, of course.

248
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,590
它价值5000英镑
It's worth ￡5,000.

249
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,970
你明天早上到Q博士那里拿去金条 还有你的新装备
You'll draw it from Q branch with the rest of your equipment in the morning.

250
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,390
好的 长官
Of course, sir.

251
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
早上好 Q
Morning, Q.

252
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,540
早上好 007 这边走
Good morning, 007. This way, please.

253
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,870
今天早上大家都很忙啊
My, we are busy this morning.

254
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,590
还不够完美
It's not perfected yet.

255
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,380
- 我的宾利呢 - 那车恐怕已经过时了
- Where's my Bentley? - It's had its day, I'm afraid.

256
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,390
- 它从来没让我失望过 - 这是M的命令
- But it's never let me down. - M's orders, 007.

257
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,930
这是你的阿斯顿・马丁DB5 是改装过的
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5, with modifications.

258
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,980
现在请注意
Now, pay attention, please.

259
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,230
挡风玻璃是防弹的
Windscreen, bulletproof.

260
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,820
两侧的玻璃和后窗都是
As are the side and the rear windows.

261
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,070
各种车牌号可以旋转切换
Revolving number plates, naturally.

262
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,200
各个国家的都有
Valid all countries.

263
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,580
这有一个小型发报机 叫信鸽
Here's a nice little transmitting device called a homer.

264
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,370
把它向后拉一下就可以了
You prime it by pressing that back like this.

265
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,960
这种小型装备已经成了解决问题的标准装备
You see? The smaller model is now standard field issue,

266
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,380
它可以放进你的鞋跟里
to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.

267
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,500
这个大的有很强的磁性
Its larger brother is magnetic.

268
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,590
没错
Right.

269
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,670
当你看不到它的时候
To be concealed in the car you're trailing

270
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,010
可以通过车里的装置追踪到
while you keep out of sight.

271
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,720
接收器在仪表盘上
Reception on the dashboard here.

272
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
可视屏幕 有效距离150英里
Auto-visual. Range, 150 miles.

273
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,190
很精巧 也很实用
Ingenious. And useful, too.

274
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,320
可以让人在开车的时候忙里偷闲一下
Allow a man to stop off for a quick one en route.

275
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,280
我这么多年来追求完美 耐心实验
It has not been perfected after years of patient research

276
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,610
不是为了这个 007
entirely for that purpose, 007.

277
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,700
如果你能把它还有别的装备一起归还
And incidentally, we'd appreciate its return,

278
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,870
我会非常感谢你的
along with all your other equipment,

279
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,660
希望能有一次 你能把装备完好无损的带回来
intact, for once, when you return from the field.

280
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,790
你不知道
You'd be surprised

281
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,590
像我们这样出外勤也是非常不容易的
the amount of wear and tear that goes on out there in the field.

282
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,710
还有别的吗
Anything else?

283
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,670
如果你能专心学习的话
I won't keep you for more than an hour or so,

284
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,670
一个小时之内就能学会使用
if you give me your undivided attention.

285
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,010
我们还做了些非常有趣的改装
We've installed some rather interesting modifications.

286
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,760
看到这扶手了吗
You see this arm here?

287
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,390
打开顶盖 里面是防卫性武器的控制面板
Now, open the top, and inside are your defense mechanism controls.

288
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,730
烟幕 滑油 后部的防弹挡板
Smoke screen, oil slick, rear bulletproof screen,

289
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,650
左右两侧的前置机枪
and left and right front-wing machine guns.

290
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,070
这个我要特别说一下
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about.

291
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,740
看到这个档把了吗
You see the gear lever here?

292
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,490
如果把顶盖打开
Now, if you take the top off,

293
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,830
里面有一个红色的小按钮
you'll find a little red button.

294
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,950
无论如何都不要去碰它
Whatever you do, don't touch it.

295
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,120
为什么
And why not?

296
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,500
因为这样会把车顶掀掉
'Cause you'll release this section of the roof

297
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,880
然后会把里面的座椅弹射出去
and engage and then fire the passenger ejector seat.

298
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,260
弹射座椅 你一定是在开玩笑
Ejector seat? You're joking.

299
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,470
007 我从来不对工作开玩笑
I never joke about my work, 007.

300
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,350
准备好了吗
Ready, Blacking?

301
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,730
准备好了 先生 那里有一位老会员来了
Yes, sir. There's an old member dropped by, sir.

302
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,060
也要到那块场地去 您是否介意和他一起打球呢
Same handicap as yours, I wondered if you'd rather play with him.

303
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,360
他在哪
Where is he?

304
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,940
- 邦德先生 - 是的
- Mr. Bond? - Yes?

305
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,320
这位是金手指先生
This is Mr. Goldfinger.

306
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,950
- 你好啊 - 你好
- How do you do? - How do you do?

307
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,080
你们可以开始了 第一个洞准备好了
You can go straight off, the first tee is clear.

308
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,620
- 好的 - 邦德先生 我会找球童帮你拿球袋
- Fine. - I'll get Hawker to carry for you, Mr. Bond.

309
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,750
非常好
That'll be splendid.

310
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,170
一球一先令怎么样
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?

311
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,670
我要带点茶
I'll take some tees.

312
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,170
好的
Yes, of course.

313
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,720
邦德先生 请原谅这位"怪侠"
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr. Bond.

314
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,270
他是个好仆人 也是个哑巴
He's an admirable manservant, but mute.

315
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,230
但他不是个好球童
He's not a very good caddie.

316
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:09,900
高尔夫在韩国还不是个全国性的运动
Golf is not yet the national game of Korea, hey?

317
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,490
我们的这次见面不是巧合吧
This meeting is not a coincidence, hmm?

318
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,410
邦德先生 你耍的什么花样
What's your game, Mr. Bond?

319
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,170
我耍花样
My game?

320
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,260
你不是来打高尔夫球的
You didn't come here to play golf.

321
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,610
1940年纳粹在埃森铸造而成
The 1940 smelt from the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.

322
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,950
大约有600个
Part of a smelt of 600.

323
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,700
在1944年消失
They vanished in 1944.

324
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,700
当纳粹战败的时候
When the Nazis were on the run.

325
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,160
你还有别的吗
And you have access to more?

326
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,330
有 和它是一样的
Yes, from the same source.

327
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,830
真有趣
Interesting.

328
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,290
- 还剩两个洞 - 是的 不分胜负
- Two holes to go. - Yes, and all square.

329
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,590
你不反对现在把我们的赌注提高吧
Then you have no objection to increasing the stakes?

330
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,590
不反对 你想赌什么
No, what do you have in mind?

331
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,550
当然是赌你带来的金条
The bar of gold you have with you, naturally.

332
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,560
它值5000英镑
It's worth ￡5,000.

333
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,060
我用同等价值的现金
I'll stake the cash equivalent.

334
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,230
好的
Naturally.

335
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,980
完全遵照高尔夫的规则吗
Strict rules of golf?

336
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,530
当然
But of course.

337
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,270
你的运气不好 球落在草丛里了
Bad luck. You're in the rough.

338
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,740
真可惜 在这里
What a pity. Here it is.

339
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,620
不 这不是 我打的是1号球
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.

340
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,670
7号球
史莱辛格

341
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,250
完全按照高尔夫的规则 金手指先生
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger.

342
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,580
5分钟快到了
Five minutes are almost up.

343
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,750
如果找不到球就会罚一棍
A lost ball will cost you a stroke and distance.

344
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,650
我一直在训练他当球童
I'm still training him as a caddie.

345
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,150
也挺成功的
Successfully, too.

346
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,990
- 是1号球吗 - 好
- Slazenger Number 1? - Good.

347
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,240
如果那是他原来的球 那我就是球王了
If that's his original ball, I'm Arnold Palmer.

348
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,830
那不是
It isn't.

349
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,120
- 你怎么知道 - 它现在就在我脚底下
- How do you know? - I'm standing on it.

350
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,040
你这个狡猾的...
Why, you crafty old...

351
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,590
不要动它
Leave it.

352
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,470
这是你找到的球吗 先生
The ball you found, sir?

353
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,340
是的 7号球
Yes, Slazenger 7.

354
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,470
我们和金手指先生开个玩笑吧
Let's have a little fun with Mr. Goldfinger.

355
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,600
你想让我先标上还是先打
Would you like me to mark it or knock it in?

356
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,980
打吧
Play it.

357
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,860
- 一球定胜负 - 是的
- This for a half. - That's right.

358
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,960
还有一洞 关键性的一球
One to go. That'll be the clincher.

359
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,130
好
Fine.

360
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,880
先生 你把球换过了吗
Did you switch them, sir?

361
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,130
那就骗到他了
Then we've got him.

362
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,550
如果他没有注意到的话
If he doesn't notice the switch.

363
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,310
- 先生 应该你先打 - 没关系
- It's your honor, sir! - It's all right.

364
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,170
低于5棍
Down in five.

365
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,170
我必须打进这个球才能赢 对吗
I have to sink this to halve the game, right?

366
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,890
你赢了 金手指先生
You win, Goldfinger.

367
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,180
看来我打得比你好
It seems I'm too good for you.

368
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,310
你打的是1号球 对吧
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?

369
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,480
- 是的 怎么了 - 这是7号球
- Yes, why? - This is a Slazenger 7.

370
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,570
这是我的球
Here's my Penfold Hearts.

371
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,700
你一定是在打18洞的时候把球弄给错了
You must have played the wrong ball somewhere on the 18th fairway.

372
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,530
我们严格按照规则打球
We are playing strict rules,

373
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,450
所以恐怕你的这个洞和整个比赛都输了
so I'm afraid you lose the hole and the match.

374
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,780
幽灵3型 1937年产 她可真美 是吗
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?

375
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,120
邦德先生 你很聪明 而且阅历丰富
You are a clever, resourceful man, Mr. Bond.

376
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
谢谢
Why, thank you.

377
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,910
也许太聪明了点 我们曾两次交手
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths have crossed,

378
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,670
就这样吧
let's leave it at that.

379
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,420
我应该在第一次见面的时候就说服你
I should think our first meeting would have convinced you.

380
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,800
我知道
I see.

381
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,340
你担心我不会和你继续这个游戏
You're worried about me not giving you a return game.

382
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,760
我们两个都
Both of us know perfectly well

383
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,890
心知肚明 邦德先生
what we're talking about, Mr. Bond.

384
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,390
但我觉得有必要再提醒你一次
But I see that it is necessary to remind you.

385
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,720
怪侠
Oddjob!

386
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,940
曾经有很多人想插手我的事
Many people have tried to involve themselves

387
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,190
不过他们都没有成功
in my affairs, unsuccessfully.

388
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,370
真了不起 但是不知道俱乐部的主人会说什么
Remarkable. But what does the club secretary have to say?

389
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,460
什么都不会说 邦德先生
Nothing, Mr. Bond.

390
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,040
这个俱乐部是我的
I own the club.

391
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,170
我觉得你应该是愿意要支票的吧
I assume you want the check made out to cash?

392
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,800
当然愿意 这样很好
That would be perfectly satisfactory.

393
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,180
再见 邦德先生
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

394
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,400
我想这是你的
I believe this is yours.

395
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,230
各位旅客请注意
May I have your attention, please?

396
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,060
英国航空最后一次播报
British United Air Ferries announcing final call

397
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,980
前往日内瓦的DS-400航班即将起飞
for the departure of their DS-400 flight to Geneva.

398
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,410
英国航空最后一次播报
British United Air Ferries announce the departure

399
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,200
前往日内瓦的DS-400航班即将起飞
of their DS-400 flight to Geneva.

400
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,290
邦德先生
Mr. Bond?

401
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,500
都安排好了 我给你订了在
That's all right, I've got you booked out

402
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,710
半个小时之后去日内瓦的下一班飞机
on the next flight to Geneva leaving in half an hour.

403
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,130
- 谢谢你 - 没关系 先生
- Thank you very much. - Right, sir.

404
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
要守纪律 007
Discipline, 007.

405
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,380
守纪律
Discipline.

406
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,930
你还好吗
Are you all right?

407
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,180
我来帮你 你知道吗 你能活着已经很幸运了
Here, let me help you. You know, you're lucky to be alive.

408
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,680
别指望我会感谢你
No thanks to you.

409
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,940
你应该把车开的离我远一点
You should have pulled over further.

410
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,230
看看你干的好事
Look at them!

411
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,820
两个轮胎一起爆 我之前没见过这样的
A double blowout. I've never seen one of these before.

412
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,780
新的车胎怎么会这样
How could new tires...

413
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,160
也许是因为它们的质量不好
Defect of some kind, most likely.

414
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,660
不管怎么说 人没事就好 只是车坏了而已
Anyway, I'm so glad it's only the car and not you.

415
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,660
你看起来不像是个短命的女孩
You don't look like the sort of girl who should be ditched.

416
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,290
别管那个了 请把我送到离这最近的修理厂
Never mind that. Please take me to the nearest garage.

417
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,170
好的 顺便说一下 我叫邦德
Certainly. By the way, my name is Bond...

418
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,670
尽可能快点
As quickly as possible.

419
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,550
- 这个我自己拿 - 好的
- I'll take that. - Yes, of course.

420
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,900
你叫什么名字
What's your name, by the way?

421
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,820
索姆斯 蒂莉・索姆斯
Soames. Tilly Soames.

422
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,740
你是来打猎的吗
Here for the hunting season?

423
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,910
我也有一个这样的箱子
I had a case just like that one.

424
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,700
这是我的溜冰鞋
It's for my ice skates.

425
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,080
不错的运动
Lovely sport.

426
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,420
- 你在哪里滑冰 - 圣莫里茨
- Where do you skate? - St. Moritz.

427
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,130
我不知道那里在这个时候也会结冰
I didn't know there was ice there this time of the year.

428
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,260
那里有个修车厂
There's a garage.

429
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,270
我发生了一起意外
I've had an accident.

430
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,080
要用多长时间 谢谢你
How long will it take? Thank you.

431
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,500
他们说换新胎要花24个小时
They say it will take 24 hours to get new tires.

432
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,670
附近有一间旅馆
There's a hotel nearby.

433
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,880
上来 我带你去
Jump in. I'll run you down.

434
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,880
这就不用了
That won't be necessary.

435
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,630
我不想把你单独扔下
I hate to leave you here alone.

436
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,550
我能照顾我自己
I can take care of myself.

437
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,550
我相信你能
Yes, I'm sure you can.

438
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,970
不要忘记写信
Well, don't forget to write.

439
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,350
奥瑞克企业

440
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,510
凌先生 走私是一门艺术
Smuggling is an art, Mr. Ling.

441
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,340
艺术的标准是...
And art requires...

442
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,600
我用18K的黄金来打造我的
In this case, the bodywork of my Rolls Royce

443
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,310
劳斯莱斯的车身
is 18-carat gold.

444
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
我们现在黄金拆下来
We dismantle it here,

445
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,940
用特制的冶炼炉把它还原
reduce the gold in this special furnace to ingots,

446
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,780
装着黄金车身的车可以被海关放行 大约可以带两吨
which in turn will be released on the board and weigh approximately two tons.

447
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,570
凌先生 我一年带着劳斯莱斯
I make six trips a year to the continent

448
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,450
到欧洲大陆六次
in the Rolls Royce, Mr. Ling.

449
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,450
暂缓你的其他行动是明智的
It would be wiser to suspend your other activities.

450
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,460
凌先生 现在全力执行
Now, Mr. Ling, please assure your principals

451
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,420
大满贯计划是我们的第一要务
Operation Grand Slam will have my undivided attention.

452
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,300
现在 我们要商量一下 把事情定下来
Now, there are certain matters we must discuss.

453
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,480
快放开我 你要弄断我的背了
Let me go! You're breaking my back!

454
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,570
你在这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

455
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,990
我要杀了他
I want to kill him!

456
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,700
- 杀谁 - 金手指
- Kill who? - Goldfinger.

457
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
我想让他活着
I want him alive.

458
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,620
我想要他死 他杀了我姐姐
I want him dead. He killed my sister.

459
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,660
T.M 蒂莉・麦斯特森
T.M. Tilly Masterson.

460
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,410
我知道你姐姐 吉儿
I knew your sister, Jill.

461
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,540
我知道她在迈阿密发生了什么事
I know what he did to her in Miami.

462
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,540
不 你不知道 让我走
No, you don't. Let me go!

463
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,460
如果你想杀他 为什么要对我开枪
If you wanted to kill him, why did you shoot at me?

464
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,210
我没有 我是在对他开枪
I didn't. I was shooting at him.

465
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,790
你的枪法太差劲了
You're a lousy shot.

466
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,590
这里有人枪法很好 快走
Somebody else around here isn't. Come on.

467
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,100
快点 到车里去 我来对付他
Quick. Get in the car. I'll take care of him.

468
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,260
当我告诉你的时候 你就跑到草丛里
Run for that bracken when I tell you.

469
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,190
快跑
Now!

470
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,770
晚上好啊 007
Good evening, 007.

471
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,190
我叫詹姆斯・邦德
My name is James Bond.

472
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,780
你是你们这个行业里为数不多的佼佼者
And members of your curious profession are few in number.

473
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,320
你被一位和你一样有
You have been recognized,

474
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,540
杀人执照的对手
let's say, by one of your opposite numbers,

475
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,580
给认出来了
who is also licensed to kill.

476
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,910
你的车很有趣
That interesting car of yours!

477
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,630
我也有一个新玩具
I, too, have a new toy,

478
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,800
但是它更实用
but considerably more practical.

479
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,220
你看到的这个工业激光发射器
You are looking at an industrial laser

480
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,720
能发射出一种自然界没有的 非常奇特的光
which emits an extraordinary light not to be found in nature.

481
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,220
它能发射到月球
It can project a spot on the moon,

482
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,600
也可以近距离切割坚硬的金属
or at closer range cut through solid metal.

483
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,140
我会给你演示一下
I will show you.

484
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,300
邦德先生 这是黄金
This is gold, Mr. Bond.

485
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,590
我非常喜欢它的颜色
All my life, I've been in love with its color,

486
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,350
喜欢它的光泽 喜欢它那神圣的重量
its brilliance, its divine heaviness.

487
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,020
我欢迎任何能增加我的黄金储备的企业
I welcome any enterprise that will increase my stock.

488
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,190
我会把它们列入考虑范围
Which is considerable.

489
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,440
我想你已经表达了你的观点 金手指 感谢你的示范
I think you've made your point, Goldfinger. Thank you for the demonstration.

490
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,110
俏皮话说的小心点 邦德先生
Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr. Bond.

491
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,950
那没准是你的最后一句话
It may be your last.

492
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,870
我对我们前两次交手的目的
The purpose of our two previous encounters

493
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,290
已经非常清楚了
is now very clear to me.

494
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,120
我不想被分散精力
I do not intend to be distracted by another.

495
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,880
晚安 邦德先生
Good night, Mr. Bond.

496
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,460
你希望我招供吗
Do you expect me to talk?

497
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,630
不 邦德先生 我希望你死
No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.

498
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,220
你没有什么事可以告诉我
There is nothing you can talk to me about

499
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,260
我什么都知道
that I don't already know.

500
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,820
你忘了一件事
You're forgetting one thing.

501
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,490
如果我没有回去报到 008就会接替我
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.

502
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,740
我想他会比你更成功的
I trust he will be more successful.

503
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,000
但我知道的这些 他也知道
But he knows what I know.

504
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,080
邦德先生 你什么也不知道
You know nothing, Mr. Bond.

505
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,710
比如大满贯计划
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.

506
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,990
你无意中听到的这个词
Two words you may have overheard,

507
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,030
你 还有你们组织中的其他人
which cannot possibly have any significance to you

508
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,450
都不会明白其中的含义
or anyone in your organization.

509
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,960
你能冒这个险吗
Can you afford to take that chance?

510
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,930
邦德先生 你说的很对
You are quite right, Mr. Bond.

511
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,310
你活着对我更有价值
You are worth more to me alive.

512
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,010
你是谁
Who are you?

513
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,510
我叫普西・葛罗尔
My name is Pussy Galore.

514
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,270
我一定是在做梦
I must be dreaming.

515
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,860
我以为我已经死了
I thought I'd wake up dead.

516
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,490
那是麻醉枪 能让你不省人事
Tranquilizer gun. Knock-out shot.

517
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,740
原来是这样
I see.

518
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,250
很高兴来到这
I'm delighted to be here.

519
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,710
顺便问一下 这是哪
And by the way, where is here?

520
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,920
35000英尺高空 正在纽芬兰的西南方飞行
35,000 feet, flying southwest over Newfoundland.

521
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,640
难怪我有点耳鸣
That explains the humming.

522
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,800
耳鸣是因为你在金手指先生的飞机上
The humming means you're in Mr. Goldfinger's

523
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:15,180
正在飞往巴尔的摩
Lockheed Jetstar heading for Baltimore,

524
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,640
你是他的客人
and you're his guest.

525
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,060
我很荣幸
I'm honored.

526
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,560
我不知道他为什么这么喜欢让我陪着他
I never realized he enjoyed my company that much.

527
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,520
一路上不会都这么好玩的
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.

528
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,110
美丽
Mei-lei.

529
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,570
邦德先生 你有什么需要吗
Can I do something for you, Mr. Bond?

530
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,450
来一杯酒就行 马提尼
Just a drink. A martini.

531
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,330
要摇 不要搅
Shaken, not stirred.

532
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,460
- 你也来一杯吗 - 工作的时候不喝
- Won't you join me? - Not on duty.

533
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,040
我是金手指先生的私人飞行员
I'm Mr. Goldfinger's personal pilot.

534
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,500
是吗
You are?

535
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:46,920
有多私人
And just how personal is that?

536
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,720
我是个好飞行员 仅此而已
I'm a damned good pilot. Period.

537
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,340
这是个好消息
Well, that's good news.

538
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,600
我们的主人到哪里去了
By the way, where is our host?

539
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,310
他提前出发了
He flew on ahead.

540
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,730
谢谢你
Thank you.

541
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,610
敬大满贯计划
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.

542
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,910
这是一次令人难忘的飞行
This should be a memorable flight.

543
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,660
你不必再展现魅力了 我免疫
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.

544
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,560
55分钟之后
We'll be landing in Baltimore,

545
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,310
我们会在巴尔的摩机场降落
our port of entry into the United States,

546
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:42,980
进入美国领土
in 55 minutes.

547
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:49,480
美丽 我们到达的时候我想穿得正式点
Mei-Lei, I would like to arrive more appropriately dressed.

548
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,400
我的行李和我一样活下来了吗
Did any of my luggage survive with me?

549
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
原来的箱子呢
And my attache case?

550
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,540
黑色的箱子在检查的时候损坏了
Black attache case damaged when examined.

551
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,870
所以很抱歉
So sorry.

552
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,250
不需要道歉
Apology is quite unnecessary.

553
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,170
辛尼 叫美丽盯着他
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei to keep an eye on him.

554
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,860
20分钟后降落
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

555
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:55,780
你想来点轻松的 还是想来点狠的
Do you want to play it easy or the hard way?

556
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,530
这不是麻醉枪
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

557
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:01,120
普西 你对枪不如对飞机了解
Now, Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns.

558
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,370
这是史密斯&威森手枪 点45口径
That's a Smith and Wesson .45,

559
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,080
如果你近距离开枪
and if you fired at this close range,

560
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,210
子弹会穿过我并打穿机身
the bullet will pass through me and the fuselage

561
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,420
就像火焰穿过奶油一样
like a blowtorch through butter.

562
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,630
机舱内压力降低
The cabin will depressurize,

563
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,750
我们都会被吸到机舱之外
and we'll both be sucked into outer space together.

564
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,380
如果你想这么去美国 那么就请动手吧
But if that's how you want to enter the United States, you're welcome.

565
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,760
对于我来说 我比较喜欢容易的方式
As for me, I prefer the easier way.

566
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,970
合情合理
That's very sensible.

567
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,140
金手指先生的周围有很多有趣的事
Besides, there's always so much going on around Mr. Goldfinger.

568
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,810
我不会不接受他的热情款待
I wouldn't dream of not accepting his hospitality.

569
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,770
他见到你也会很高兴的
He'll be glad to see you, too.

570
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,940
你喜欢以身试险 对吗
You like close shaves, don't you?

571
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,610
华盛顿来电 长官 绿色的电话
Washington, sir, on the green scrambler.

572
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,570
- 我是M - 我是莱特 长官
- M here. - Leiter, sir.

573
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,620
哦 莱特
Leiter!

574
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:48,000
是007 长官 我们收到了他的小型发报机的信号
It's about 007, sir. We picked up his homer signal.

575
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,290
他们刚刚降落在巴尔的摩的友谊机场
It's monitored into Friendship Airport, Baltimore,

576
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,370
我们已经监控了他们
where he's just landed.

577
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,920
巴尔的摩 很高兴他能通知我们
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.

578
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,750
我们听说之前他在瑞士
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.

579
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,170
他是坐私人飞机来的
He came in on a private jet, ex-Geneva,

580
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,630
机主是我们的老朋友 奥瑞克・金手指
registered to our old friend, Auric Goldfinger.

581
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,010
- 很高兴他能有进展 - 是的 长官
- I'm glad he's making progress. - Yes, sir.

582
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,390
请帮我们多留意他
Keep an eye on him for us.

583
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,600
他们的目的地是肯塔基州的蓝草机场
Their flight plan gives Blue Grass Field, Kentucky, as their final destination.

584
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,390
现在先不要主动去联系他
Don't charge in on him and spoil anything, will you?

585
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,060
这个时候他应该能掌控全局了
He's evidently well on top at the moment.

586
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:19,620
普西葛罗尔飞行马戏团

587
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:37,210
- 邦德先生 请吧 - 好的
- Mr. Bond, please. - Of course.

588
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,920
随时候教
Any time.

589
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,090
谢谢
Thank you.

590
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,730
小心台阶 机长
Do mind your step, Captain.

591
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,940
别耍花招
Just keep playing it easy.

592
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,700
美丽 你去看看事情都安排好了吗
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's all right with Mr. Goldfinger?

593
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,080
- 好的 - 剩下的东西马上就会送过来
- Of course. - And I'll see the supplies are here soon.

594
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,640
她们很专业
Talented chaps.

595
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,060
这是应该的 是我训练的她们
They should be. I trained them.

596
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,930
走吧
Come on.

597
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,350
普西 你是个多才多艺的女人
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.

598
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,810
我想肯塔基的波本威士忌还有泉水
I believe that the bourbon and branch water's rather splendid

599
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,520
一定非常好
here in Kentucky.

600
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,780
现在不是工作时间 也许...
Well, now that we're both off duty, perhaps...

601
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,700
礼貌点 "怪侠"
Manners, Oddjob.

602
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,790
我以为你见到女士的时候都会脱帽
I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.

603
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,670
他杀了一些像你这样的小女孩
You know, he kills little girls like you.

604
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,420
还有小男孩
Little boys, too.

605
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,800
- 好了吗 - 队长 排练的很顺利
- Well? - Dress rehearsal went like a dream, Skipper.

606
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,140
很好 今晚做最后简报
Good. You'll get your final briefing tonight.

607
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,140
现在解散
That'll be all for now.

608
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,250
邦德先生 欢迎来到奥瑞克马场
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr. Bond.

609
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,010
马是一种很美的动物 不是吗
Lovely animal, isn't she?

610
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:30,840
当然 它们比主人好多了
Certainly better bred than the owner.

611
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,550
带邦德先生去他的住处
Show Mr. Bond to his quarters, please.

612
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,280
菲利克斯
Felix?

613
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,540
或许我们应该直接闯进去救他
Maybe we should just drop in on him.

614
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,790
他如果需要我们 就会大叫
He'll shout if he needs us.

615
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,050
金手指先生 他们都到了
They're all here, Mr. Goldfinger.

616
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,630
好的
Yes. Yes.

617
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,180
谢谢你 基希
Thank you, Kisch.

618
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,770
索罗那小子会把他的鞋底磨个洞
That guy Solo's going to wear a hole in his shoes.

619
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,490
我喜欢这个
I like this!

620
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,080
先生们
Gentlemen!

621
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,240
金手指
Goldfinger,

622
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,910
为什么没人告诉我们纽约和西海岸的人也有份
why weren't we told that New York and the West Coast were in on this?

623
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,420
搞清楚你在和谁说话
Look who's talking.

624
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,790
我不和芝加哥的人做生意
I do not do business with Chicago.

625
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,460
我以为我们在这里谈的是私人生意
I thought we had a private business deal to settle.

626
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,090
现在却发现是个大聚会
Now I find I'm attending a hood's convention.

627
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:35,590
金手指 我已经交货了 我的钱呢
Goldfinger, I made a delivery. Where is my money?

628
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,140
我也交货了
I made a delivery, too.

629
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,760
你们每个人都交完货了
You all made the deliveries we contracted for.

630
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:42,350
你欠我100万美元
And you owe me one million bucks.

631
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:47,310
我欠你们每个人100万美元的金条
I owe each of you a million in gold bullion.

632
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,730
那么付钱吧
So pay!

633
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,150
你们今天可以拿到100万
Gentlemen, you can have the million today...

634
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,740
或者明天可以拿到1000万
Or 10 millions tomorrow.

635
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,030
你是说1000万吗
Did you say 10 million?

636
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,660
只要等到明天早上银行开门
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.

637
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,830
银行周日不营业
Banks don't open on Sunday.

638
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,040
我们的银行会营业
My bank will.

639
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:16,720
这台球桌玩的又是什么把戏
What's with that trick pool table?

640
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,810
掩护他
Cover him!

641
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,230
守住门
Cover those doors!

642
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,610
把灯打开
Turn those lights back on!

643
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,400
金手指 你在耍什么花样
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?

644
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:38,070
先生们 不要这么紧张
There's no cause for alarm, gentlemen.

645
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,500
我不喜欢这样被困着
I don't like being cooped up like this.

646
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:47,000
这地图有什么用
What's that map doing there?

647
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,260
这就是我们的银行
This is my bank,

648
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,600
先生们 黄金存放在肯塔基州的诺克斯堡
the gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen.

649
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,100
这里面存放着美国的全部黄金
In its vaults are $15 billion,

650
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,770
总共价值约150亿美元
the entire gold supply of the United States.

651
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,940
抢劫诺克斯堡吗
Knock off Fort Knox?

652
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,280
- 你有钥匙吗 - 差不多
- Got a key or something? - Of a kind.

653
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,280
那里有一支35000人的部队驻守
There are 35,000 troops stationed around there!

654
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,540
是41000人
41,000.

655
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,790
金手指 你让谁去把他们制服
And who's going to say boo to them, Goldfinger?

656
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,580
- 这是怎么回事 - 怎么了
- Hey, what's going on here? - Hey, what is this?

657
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,960
地板
The floor!

658
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,300
这是到底是什么
What is this, a merry-go-round?

659
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,480
人类已经登上了珠穆朗玛峰
Man has climbed Mount Everest,

660
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,240
潜入大洋的海底
gone to the bottom of the ocean.

661
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,870
发射火箭到月球
He has fired rockets to the moon,

662
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,120
分裂原子
split the atom,

663
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,160
人类的努力已经在各行各业里创造了奇迹
achieved miracles in every field of human endeavor

664
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,000
除了犯罪以外
except crime!

665
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:19,210
整个世界最终会被黑道人物的成就所折服
The underworld will rock with applause for centuries.

666
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,420
- 废话少说 - 对 说重点
- Cut the commercial. - Yeah, get to the point.

667
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,710
金手指 你是在浪费我的时间
You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.

668
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,380
金库是攻不破的
The depository is impregnable.

669
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,510
听着 金库是防爆的 装有电网
Look, the joint is bombproof, electrified, lousy with...

670
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,090
请耐心点
Bear with me, please!

671
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:32,060
诺克斯堡是个银行 和其他的一样
Fort Knox is a bank, like any other.

672
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,890
也许它更大 受到了更好的保护
Larger, better-protected perhaps,

673
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,230
但还是一间银行
but, nonetheless, a bank.

674
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,730
他可以 我是想说 被攻破
It can be, I think the expression is, blown.

675
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,780
先生们 按照我的计划 就是个傻瓜也能做到
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen.

676
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:46,570
我叫它大满贯计划
I call it Operation Grand Slam.

677
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,820
我已经投入了15年的心血
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.

678
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,950
每一个细节都仔细核对 准备妥当
Every detail has been scrupulously prepared.

679
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,370
考虑过每一种可能性
Every eventuality has been considered.

680
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,120
我们的计划会分秒不差的进行
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.

681
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,790
麦德奈特先生 你的公司负责运送金属罐
Your organization, Mr. Midnight, brought the consignment

682
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,840
穿过加拿大和美国的边境
of these canisters across the Canadian border.

683
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,260
这里面装着德尔塔9号
They contain Delta 9.

684
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,470
- 德尔塔9号 - 那是什么
- Delta 9? - What's that?

685
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:13,310
一种无色的神经毒气 发射后15分钟扩散
An invisible nerve gas which disperses 15 minutes

686
01:11:13,390 --> 01:11:19,560
可以让人昏迷足足24个小时
after inducing complete unconsciousness for 24 hours.

687
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,940
明天凌晨
Tomorrow at dawn,

688
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,780
我的飞行马戏团的飞行员 普西・葛罗尔小姐
the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore,

689
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,700
会把它撒到空中
will spray it into the atmosphere.

690
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:37,780
007呼叫中情局
空中有毒气
一旦扩散整个军队
全都要昏迷
诺克斯堡

691
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:37,250
包括军队在内的所有人都会昏迷
Once the population, including the military, has been immobilized,

692
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:38,750
我的行动队
my task force,

693
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,460
由斯特拉普率领
which Mr. Strap had his people

694
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,040
从墨西哥穿越格兰德河
smuggle across the Rio Grande from Mexico,

695
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:47,130
乘车来到诺斯克堡
will approach Fort Knox in motorized equipment

696
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,670
他们会沿着经过金库的
along Bullion Boulevard

697
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,220
黄金大道前进
which runs past the depository here,

698
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,890
穿过金库大街到达金库
and intersects with Gold Vault Road.

699
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,980
金库周围的围墙
This fence surrounding the depository,

700
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,350
正如斯特拉普先生说的那样 装有电网
as Mr. Strap reminded us, is electrified.

701
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,770
它会被炸毁
It will be dynamited.

702
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,650
我的行动队会经由主路达到金库门口 然后把它炸毁
My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it.

703
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,150
怎么炸毁
How, may I ask?

704
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,200
这就得靠你了 索罗先生
You made that possible, Mr. Solo,

705
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,280
通过你在运输界拥有的广泛的影响力
by arranging through your considerable influence in shipping circles

706
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,160
在装备上打上"工业零件"的标签
to bring through customs uninspected

707
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,410
就可以不经检查的运过来
a consignment labeled "machine parts."

708
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:23,420
剩下的事就是要进入
All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults,

709
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,210
存放金条的金库了
where the bullion is stored.

710
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,750
- 够了 - 让他说完
- I've heard enough. - Let him finish.

711
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,970
如果你不介意的话 我现在就要拿回我的钱
If you have no objection, I'll take my money now.

712
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,300
怎么了 索罗 这事对你来说太大了吗
What's the matter, Solo, too big for you to handle?

713
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,440
先生们 我们必须尊重索罗先生的决定
Gentlemen, we must respect Mr. Solo's decision.

714
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,360
我失陪几分钟 我要先招呼索罗先生
Please excuse me for a few minutes while I take care of him.

715
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,570
大家随意 不要拘束
Make yourselves comfortable.

716
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,630
- 我们要怎么把金块拿走 - 我也想知道这个
- How do we get it out? - That's the bit I want to hear.

717
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,440
普西
Pussy.

718
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,440
谁教你的柔道
Who taught you judo?

719
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,480
把你的枪拿出来
The gun you took.

720
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,070
枪
The gun.

721
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,700
这把枪
The gun, of course.

722
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:49,840
改天我们一定要比试一下
We must have a few fast falls together sometime.

723
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:09,440
嘿 斯特拉普 如果他知道怎么办
Hey, Strap, if he's got the right answers,

724
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,440
那我们就不必到现场了
you and me don't even have to be there.

725
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,400
手下们会处理好的
The boys can handle everything.

726
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,950
他们把壁炉封上了
Hey, they closed up the fireplace.

727
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,250
怎么了
What's going on?

728
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,620
- 我不喜欢这样 - 怎么...
- I don't like this. - What the...

729
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,290
怎么回事
What's going on here?

730
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,550
毒气
The gas!

731
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,660
索洛先生 很遗憾你没能和其他先生做出一样的选择
Such a pity you did not choose to remain with the others, Mr. Solo.

732
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,080
然而
However...

733
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,750
邦德先生 我想你现在应该在你的房间里休息
Mr. Bond, I thought you were resting in your quarters.

734
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:13,500
房间很好 不过外面的天气太好了 应该出来走走
They are delightful, but it's much too nice to stay indoors.

735
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:17,260
我碰到了葛罗尔小姐 她建议我应该来见见你
I ran into Miss Galore, and she suggested that we join you.

736
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:19,510
索罗先生 这是邦德先生
Mr. Solo, Mr. Bond,

737
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,550
- 我的另一位贵宾 - 你好
- Another of my distinguished guests. - Hello.

738
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,390
索罗先生 这么快就要走吗
Leaving us so soon, Mr. Solo?

739
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,390
很遗憾 他有紧急的事情需要处理
Unfortunately, he has a pressing engagement.

740
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:28,140
是的 我要走了 金手指
Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.

741
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:29,190
小子
Boy!

742
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:30,810
该走的时候就要走
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

743
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,480
我的飞机会把你准时送到纽约
My plane will get you to New York on time...

744
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,400
你的行李也会一起送过去
With your excess luggage.

745
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:37,940
让我来
Allow me.

746
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:41,320
我的司机是个好司机
My chauffeur's an excellent driver.

747
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:43,950
你马上就会到机场
You'll be at the airport in a few minutes.

748
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,750
再见 索罗先生 或许下次我们有机会合作
Goodbye, Mr. Solo. Some other time, perhaps.

749
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,620
希望你平安落地
Happy landings, old boy.

750
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,880
我在模型下面发现他
I found him under the model.

751
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:02,430
大满贯行动 我喜欢你的简报
Operation Grand Slam. I did enjoy your briefing.

752
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,970
我也是
So did I.

753
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,790
他出发了
He's on the move!

754
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:54,270
慢点 别离得太近
Slow down. Don't crowd him.

755
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:14,040
你瞎了吗 过了那个路口了
Are you blind or something? You missed the turn.

756
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,740
他们在前面的路口右转了
They've turned to the right just ahead here somewhere.

757
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:05,840
你的这位老朋友要去哪里
Where's this old pal of yours headed?

758
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,760
赌十美元 他要去喝酒或者找女人
Ten will get you one, it's a drink or a dame.

759
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,390
- 信号没有了 - 也许是机械故障
- Dead. - Mechanical failure, maybe.

760
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,690
- 除非他把它关掉 - 他为什么要这么做
- Unless he switched it off. - Why would he do that?

761
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,440
我们现在只能把车开到农场去了
Drive to the farm. It's all we can do.

762
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:29,690
好的
Right.

763
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,830
谢谢
Thank you.

764
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,330
谢谢
Thank you.

765
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,750
亲爱的 你在大满贯计划中分到的钱
Your share of Operation Grand Slam

766
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,590
能让你成为一个非常富有的女人
will make you a very rich woman, my dear.

767
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,720
否则我为什么要参与呢 金手指先生
Why else would I be in it, Mr. Goldfinger?

768
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,180
我想你退休之后会回到英国吧
You'll retire to England, I suppose?

769
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,220
不 我看中了巴哈马群岛中的一个小岛
No, I've spotted a little island in the Bahamas.

770
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,940
我会挂起一块牌子 上面写着"禁止入内"
I'll hang up a sign, "No trespassing,"

771
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,980
然后回归自然
and go back to nature.

772
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,690
基希 有什么事吗
Yes, Kisch?

773
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,530
有两个男人开着车 带着望远镜
Two men in a car with binoculars.

774
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,820
到处询问赛马的预测
Touts looking for racing tips.

775
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,000
还有另外一种可能
There's another possibility, however.

776
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,000
基希 把邦德先生叫过来
Kisch, ask Mr. Bond to join us.

777
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,540
如果那些人是邦德先生的朋友
We were quite right to spare Mr. Bond's life in Switzerland

778
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,790
那么我在瑞士放了他一命看来是对的
if those gentlemen are his friends.

779
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,710
让我们告诉那两个人 邦德先生不需要帮助
Let's convince them he needs no assistance.

780
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,720
为了对付他们 普西
For their benefit, Pussy,

781
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,300
我们要让邦德先生尽可能的高兴
let's make him as happy as possible.

782
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,390
我建议你去换一件更合适衣服
I suggest you change into something more suitable.

783
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,430
当然
Certainly.

784
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,980
公事更重要
Business before pleasure.

785
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,370
他找你
He wants you.

786
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,430
邦德先生 请做 要薄荷茶吗
Mr. Bond. Sit down, please. Mint julep?

787
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,600
- 传统口味 还不错 - 好的 谢谢
- Traditional, but satisfying. - Yes, thanks.

788
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,180
酸麦的 但不要太甜
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.

789
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,690
金手指 你真让我失望
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.

790
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,190
你知道大满贯计划是不会成功的
You know Operation Grand Slam simply won't work.

791
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,190
顺便说一下 这种神经毒剂是致命的
And incidentally, Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.

792
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,530
邦德先生 你的消息还是一如既往的灵通
You are unusually well-informed, Mr. Bond.

793
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:42,080
你会让6万人死掉
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.

794
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,660
美国两年的交通事故死亡人数也就这么多
American motorists kill that many every two years.

795
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,420
是的 我自己也计算了一下
Yes, I've worked out a few statistics of my own.

796
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:55,420
150亿美元的金条重达10500吨
$15 billion in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.

797
01:22:55,510 --> 01:23:00,470
60个人要搬12天 要装在200辆卡车上
60 men would take 12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.

798
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,100
而你最多只会有两小时
Now, at the most, you're gonna have two hours

799
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,680
在陆军 海军 空军还有海军陆战队到来之前
before the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines move in

800
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:07,810
把它们运走
and make you put it back.

801
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,190
谁说我要把金条运走了
Who mentioned anything about removing it?

802
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,280
饮料还够吗
The julep tart enough for you?

803
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,320
你计划闯入世界上最大的银行
You plan to break into the world's largest bank,

804
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:23,080
但是却不偷任何东西
but not to steal anything?

805
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:24,870
为什么
Why?

806
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,290
继续说 邦德先生
Go on, Mr. Bond.

807
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:30,170
凌先生 中国共产党派到工厂里的特工
Mr. Ling, the red Chinese agent at the factory,

808
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,790
他是核物理学专家
he's a specialist in nuclear fission.

809
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,840
当然了
But of course!

810
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,090
他的政府会给你一个炸弹
His government's given you a bomb.

811
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,100
我更愿意把它叫做原子装置
I prefer to call it an atomic device.

812
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,560
很小 但是很脏
It's small, but particularly dirty.

813
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,520
钴和碘
Cobalt and iodine?

814
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,890
没错
Precisely.

815
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,690
如果你在诺克斯堡引爆它
If you explode it in Fort Knox,

816
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:56,070
整个美国的黄金储备都会被放射性物质污染
the entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for

817
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,530
57年
57 years.

818
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,490
准确的来说 应该是58年
58, to be exact.

819
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:05,200
我很抱歉 这真是个有启发性的交易
I apologize, Goldfinger. It's an inspired deal.

820
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,620
他们想要得到的是西方世界的经济危机
They get what they want, economic chaos in the West,

821
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,920
而你所持有的黄金的价格会提升好几倍
and the value of your gold increases many times.

822
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,380
保守的估计 大约是10倍吧
I conservatively estimate 10 times.

823
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,380
真聪明
Brilliant.

824
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,930
你所说的原子装置
But the atomic device, as you call it,

825
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:25,640
现在应该已经在美国了吧
is already obviously in this country.

826
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,350
没错
Obviously.

827
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,980
但是躲过搜查 把它带到诺克斯堡
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected

828
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,190
这是很冒险的 非常冒险
could be risky, very risky.

829
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,190
正好相反 邦德先生 风险都在你们那边
On the contrary, Mr. Bond, the risk is all on your side.

830
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,860
如果你们想要找到它
If the authorities should attempt to locate it,

831
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,070
又有谁会知道它在哪里爆炸呢
who knows where it might be exploded, eh?

832
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,080
或许在新伦敦的北极星导弹潜艇那里爆炸
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London,

833
01:24:47,450 --> 01:24:49,370
肯尼迪航天中心
Cape Kennedy,

834
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,250
白宫旁边
near the White House.

835
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:55,500
我们已经仔细计算过了 大满贯计划会成功的
But we are speculating idly. Operation Grand Slam will be successful.

836
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,090
而你也会亲眼见到的
You will be there to see for yourself.

837
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:00,470
我想你会不太舒服
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

838
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:14,980
失陪一下 邦德先生 我必须从死去的索罗先生身上
Forgive me, Mr. Bond, but I must arrange to separate my gold

839
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,940
拿回我的黄金
from the late Mr. Solo.

840
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,690
正如你所说 他有要紧的事情要处理
As you said, he had a pressing engagement.

841
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:24,700
非常美 葛罗尔小姐 不是吗
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?

842
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,740
普西 替我陪一下邦德先生吧
Please entertain Mr. Bond for me, Pussy.

843
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,990
我晚点再回来
I'll join you both later.

844
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,880
怎么样 帅哥
Well, how about it, handsome?

845
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,130
我们应该趁着这次机会好好了解一下彼此 对吗
Don't you think it's time we got to know each other socially?

846
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:42,050
葛罗尔小姐
Well, the new Miss Galore.

847
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,880
你是把金手铐藏到衣服里面了吗
Where do you hide your gold knuckles in this outfit?

848
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,010
我下班后从来不带武器
I never carry weapons after business hours.

849
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:51,020
是吗 原来你下班了
Yeah? So you're off duty.

850
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,100
我现在毫无防备
I'm completely defenseless.

851
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,350
我也是
So am I.

852
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,570
这才是我认识的詹姆斯
That's my James.

853
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,530
金手指的这个地方很美
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.

854
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:09,080
是的 很高兴你能喜欢
Yes. I'm glad you're enjoying it.

855
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,580
太可惜了 明天早上这一切都要毁了
Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning.

856
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,290
你知道的 他疯了
He's quite mad, you know.

857
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,590
我们在这里做什么
Well, now, what do we have here?

858
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,590
007看起来把情况处理的很好
007 seems to have the situation well in hand.

859
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:28,970
走吧 我累了 我们回酒店去吧
Come on, I'm bushed. Let's get back to the motel.

860
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,680
普西 你是个很不平凡的女孩
You're quite a girl, Pussy.

861
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,970
我是外向型的
I'm strictly the outdoor type.

862
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:36,350
我想你应该没有参与这整个计划
I'd like to think you're not in all of this caper.

863
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,480
不说这个 我没有兴趣 走吧
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.

864
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:43,280
我要怎么做才能让你以我的方式看待事情
What would it take for you to see things my way?

865
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:45,610
你没有那能力
A lot more than you've got.

866
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,370
- 你是怎么知道的 - 我不想知道
- How do you know? - I don't want to know.

867
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:52,700
满足将死的人
Isn't it customary

868
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,370
的请求 也算是个惯例吧
to grant a condemned man his last request?

869
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,330
这是你自找的
You've asked for this.

870
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,460
起来
Get up.

871
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,550
当然
Certainly.

872
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,070
现在我们一起玩玩
There. Now, let's both play.

873
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:59,440
普西・葛罗尔呼叫香槟领队
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.

874
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,190
指挥官摇摆宝贝
Commence Rock-a-bye Baby.

875
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:02,560
祝你好运
Good luck.

876
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,800
速度 220
Speed, 220.

877
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,840
风向 西风
Wind check, westerly.

878
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
香槟领队呼叫香槟队员
Champagne leader to Champagne section.

879
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,230
准备俯冲
Commence dive now.

880
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:56,490
摇摆宝贝准备好
Ready for Rock-a-bye Baby.

881
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:58,660
喷洒倒计时开始
Commence spray on countdown.

882
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,500
5
Five,

883
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:03,420
4 3 2
four, three, two,

884
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,080
0
zero.

885
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,420
欢迎来到诺克斯堡

886
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:52,610
香槟领队呼叫大满贯行动领队
Champagne leader to Grand Slam task force leader.

887
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:53,940
宝贝已经睡着
The baby is asleep.

888
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,780
重复 宝贝已经睡着
I repeat, the baby is asleep.

889
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:59,200
我们正在返航 完毕
We're going home now. Out.

890
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:29,270
奥瑞克分光计

891
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:36,840
美国信托银行

892
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,750
美国信托银行

893
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,050
美国信托银行

894
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:38,470
美国信托银行

895
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,130
早上好 邦德先生
Good morning, Mr. Bond.

896
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,930
这次你终于在我想让你待在的地方了
For once, you're exactly where I want you.

897
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:42,290
- 炸弹在这 - 我们出发吧 准将
- The bomb's here. - Let's get moving, brigadier.

898
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,460
好的 杰克 出发
Right, Jack. Move in.

899
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,590
出发 保持战斗队形
Move in, commando tactics.

900
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,010
在炸弹被拆除之前 只允许做防卫性开火
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

901
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:50,720
- 炸弹拆除之前... - 走吧
- Minimum offensive fire... - Come on.

902
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,140
只允许做防卫性开火
...until I signal bomb has been neutralized.

903
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:55,640
拆弹小组待命
Bomb disposal unit to accompany dog.

904
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,880
再见了 邦德先生
Goodbye, Mr. Bond.

905
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,630
凌先生 现在只是时间问题了
Mr. Ling, it is merely a matter of timing...

906
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,990
金手指
Goldfinger!

907
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:40,240
救命 金手指先生
Please, Mr. Gold...

908
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,120
他也是其中的一个 那女孩也是 我去抓她
He's one of them! So's the girl! I'll get her!

909
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,960
你们把门打开
You get the door open!

910
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,720
我们被困住了 那颗炸弹 我要把引信拆掉
We're trapped. The bomb. I'll take the fuse out.

911
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,060
不要当傻子
Don't be a fool.

912
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,230
你想当英雄 我不想
You can be a hero. I'm not!

913
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:14,480
不 不要
No! No!

914
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,810
你们快过来 快过来
Come on, you boys! Get going! Hurry up!

915
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,540
什么事情耽误你了
What kept you?

916
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:03,080
你还好吗 詹姆斯 那位管家朋友呢
You okay, James? Where's your butler friend?

917
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:05,750
他弄坏了保险丝
He blew a fuse.

918
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,130
再有3秒钟 金手指的计划就成功了
Three more ticks and Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot.

919
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,300
你抓到他了吗
Did you get him?

920
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,720
- 还没有 他跑不远 - 普西呢
- Not yet, but he won't get far. - And Pussy?

921
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,800
她帮我们换掉了毒气瓶
She helped us switch the gas in the canisters.

922
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:17,600
顺便问一下 是什么让她这么做的
By the way, what made her call Washington?

923
01:45:20,230 --> 01:45:22,890
我一定是激发了她母性的本能
I must have appealed to her maternal instincts.

924
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:34,110
走吧 詹姆斯 上飞机 别让总统等得太久了
Come on, James. Get aboard. You can't keep the President waiting.

925
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,870
专机 到白宫吃午餐 为什么
Special plane, lunch at the White House. How come?

926
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:39,450
总统要亲自感谢你
The President wants to thank you personally.

927
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,080
这没什么
It was nothing, really.

928
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,290
我知道 但是他不知道
I know that, but he doesn't.

929
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:46,250
我想我可以在飞机上喝杯酒
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here?

930
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,380
我通知乘务员准备了三份酒
I told the stewardess liquor for three.

931
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,500
另外两个人是谁
Who are the other two?

932
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:51,090
没有别人
There are no other two.

933
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:53,300
- 再见 菲利克斯 - 再见 詹姆斯 祝你好运
- Goodbye, Felix. - So long, James. Good luck.

934
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,180
- 谢谢你 准将 - 祝你好运
- Thank you, brigadier. - Good luck.

935
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:29,960
邦德先生 欢迎登机
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr. Bond.

936
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:33,590
恭喜你升官了 金手指
Congratulations on your promotion, Goldfinger.

937
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:36,510
你也要到白宫去吃午饭吗
Are you having lunch at the White House, too?

938
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:39,220
两个小时之后 我就到古巴了
In two hours, I shall be in Cuba.

939
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:43,730
邦德先生 这是你最后一次破坏我的计划
And you have interfered with my plans for the last time, Mr. Bond.

940
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:46,140
飞机内开枪很危险
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes.

941
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:48,650
我也警告过普西
I even had to warn Pussy about it.

942
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:50,440
顺便问一下 她在哪
By the way, where is she?

943
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,360
等会儿我会处置她的
I will deal with her later.

944
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,650
现在 她在她该在的地方 驾驶舱
At the moment, she is where she ought to be. At the controls.

945
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,410
普西
Pussy.

946
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,540
出什么事了 金手指在哪
What happened? Where's Goldfinger?

947
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,290
他去弹他的黄金做的琴了
