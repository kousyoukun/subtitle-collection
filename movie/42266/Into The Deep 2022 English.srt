That was a really warm welcome.

What's his problem anyway?

193
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:54,031
It's just those guys don't
take out-of-towners very well.

194
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:57,493
Yeah, well, he made his point.
I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

Hey, don't sound so surprised.

Yeah, I'm not much of
a photographer, I know.

223
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:30,979
I'm impressed.

224
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:41,323
So, are you gonna offer me another
drink or... Oh, right, yeah!

225
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:44,117
Do you want more vodka?
I could make you a gin and tonic?

226
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,453
Sure. All right.

227
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,422
OK... How strong you want it?

228
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:59,841

overboard without this.

something for that. Hold on.

00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:38,649
Oh, I guess I've always just
been obsessed with the ocean.

Yeah.

as soon as I can.

I'm sorry.

I lost my dad, too. To cancer.

260
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,694
I don't meant to take
away from you or anything.

261
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:26,154
I just... I wanted to say I get it.

00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,746
How long have you
been away from home?

That's a long time!

My, uh... mom kind of
lost it after my dad died.

After a while, I just realised

266
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:51,138
I couldn't be responsible
for her any more.

267

474
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:16,552
OK, we're doing this.

475
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,711
Hey. Hey!

476
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:38,467
He's meticulous, isn't he?

477
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,762
Yeah, I suppose.

478
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:45,641
Uh, another drink? Sure.

479
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:50,813
(BOTTLES CLINKING)

480
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:58,696
Thank you. Cheers.

481
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:13,210
Are you feeling all right?
Uh, yeah, yeah.

482
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,466
Should we take this up? Sure.

483
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:42,114
So, how long have
you and, uh...? Ben.

484
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:47,036
Ben, yep. Um, how long have
the two of you been together?

485
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:49,705
Uh, since yesterday.

486
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:52,374
(CHUCKLES) What?

487
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:55,294
Yeah, it all happened really fast.

488
00:42:55,335 --> 00:42:58,213
I went to a party and then,
we came back to the boat

489
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:00,841
and when I woke up,
we were out here.

490
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:06,055
What, he just... He sailed out
to sea whilst you were asleep?

491
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:09,099
Yeah, but it wasn't
like that, you know.

492
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:11,268
He made breakfast
and everything.

493
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:14,772
It was actually kind of cool.

494
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,068
Romantic. I think so.

495
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,911
How old are you? 22.

496
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:33,207
(CHUCKLES) What?

497
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,505
(SIGHS) You want the
good news or the bad news?

498
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:45,511
So, the engine won't start. But the
good news is, we still have beer.

499
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:47,971
What does that mean?
Well, we can still sail.

500
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:50,516
We're just gonna have to
wait until the wind picks up.

501
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:53,560
And the engine? I've been having
a problem with it overheating.

502
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:56,730
I think it just burnt out.
My dad's gonna kill me.

503
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:59,608
Look, why don't I
just raise the sails up?

504
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,486
And as soon as the wind comes back,
we'll be on our way in, OK?

505
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:04,947
Surely there must be
some kind of way

506
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:07,157
to call the coast guard
or something?

507
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,452
Nah, the comms sat's down, too.
What? So you're saying there's no way

508
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:13,205
of anyone contacting us at all?
It's kind of great, right?

509
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:15,791
I'm mean, how often do we
really get to be unreachable?

510
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,711
Yeah! Look, let's
just make the most of it.

511
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:21,922
I like this girl!

512
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,634
Look, why don't we just say,
this is like the first part

513
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:27,928
of our little adventure, OK?

514
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,099
OK. Give me one of them.

515
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:34,351
There we go.

516
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:38,689
Cheers. Cheers.

517
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:49,199
BEN: You see?

518
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:51,535
Wind! I was just worried.

519
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:54,079
Ah, you're really
cute when you worry.

520
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:56,206
OK, more shots!

521
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:58,417
Shots, shots, shots...

522
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:03,547
OK. Here you go.

523
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:06,216
Ready? Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

524
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,096
Mm! Ugh!

525
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:14,892
You OK? Yeah.

526
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:20,564
OK, so explain this little
bond you guys have got going on.

527
00:45:20,606 --> 00:45:22,941
I want to hear all the details.

528
00:45:22,983 --> 00:45:25,194
Well, uh...

529
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:27,696
We're both members
of the dead parents club.

530
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:32,826
Oh. I'm... I'm really
sorry to hear that.

531
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,580
Mum or dad? Dad. Mum.

532
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:40,542
How long ago?

533
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:43,086
About two years.

534
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:46,048
How did he die? Heart attack.

535
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:49,635
I thought it was cancer.

536
00:45:49,676 --> 00:45:51,887
Yeah, it was.

537
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,556
He had a heart attack when
he was going through chemo.

538
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,226
His body just kind of broke down.

539
00:45:57,267 --> 00:46:00,479
Sounds kind of like
a blessing in disguise.

540
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,231
Yeah.

541
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:07,319
Well, we really lowered
the tone, didn't we?

542
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:10,864
(LAUGHS) Yeah, fuck that.
Uh, let's play a game.

543
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:14,034
I love a game. Hm, bet you do.

544
00:46:14,076 --> 00:46:16,870
Do you have a coin? Oh, yeah.

545
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:22,793
OK, game on.

546
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,545
Flip, sip, strip.

547
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:27,965
Never heard of it.

548
00:46:28,006 --> 00:46:30,509
I flip the coin,
you call heads or tails.

549
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,761
If you're right,
you're in the clear.

550
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:34,972
But if you're wrong,
you either have to

551
00:46:35,013 --> 00:46:38,225
take a sip of your drink or
take off an item of clothing.

552
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:43,146
Who gets to decide?
The other two of us, I guess?

553
00:46:43,188 --> 00:46:46,775
All right. Yeah?
Yeah, OK. Flip it.

554
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:50,445
Wait, who goes first?

555
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:52,781
Jess?

556
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,908
OK.

557
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,702
Heads.

558
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:00,163
Correct.

559
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:02,541
OK, Ben. Your turn.

560
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,336
Heads. LEXI, JESS: Oh!

561
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:10,173
What are we gonna make him do?

562
00:47:10,215 --> 00:47:13,343
Strip, obviously.
Oh, OK. All right.

563
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:17,556
This is fun. For who?

564
00:47:19,808 --> 00:47:22,519
OK. Uh, tails. (COIN FLIPS)

565
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:26,398
Nope. You're lying.

566
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,650
I'm not. Yes, you obviously are.

567
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:31,278
Strip.

568
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,572
Strip.

569
00:47:39,328 --> 00:47:40,787
OK...

570
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,294
OK, uh...

571
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:51,298
Tails. Wrong again!

572
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,342
Fuck!

573
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:55,886
How about we change it
up a little bit?

574
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,808
OK, how so?
Instead of just sip and strip, kiss.

575
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:05,562
Fine. Oh, no, no, no. Not me.

576
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:07,731
You two.

577
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:12,486
They're not the rules. What, am I
not hot enough for you or something?

578
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,738

580
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,502
You're hilarious!

581
00:48:28,543 --> 00:48:30,962
You know, as long
as we're raising the stakes

582
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,345
how about we each
take one of these?

583
00:48:38,387 --> 00:48:41,848
What are they? Yeah, all right.

584
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,185
Jess? I don't know.

585
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:47,521
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

586
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:50,690
I'm already having fun!
Come on. Don't be so boring!

587
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,275
Yeah.

588
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:58,281
There you go.

Oh! It tastes horrible.

591
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,960
There you go. All right, go.

I've been looking for you.

00:51:32,185 --> 00:51:34,521
What happened to you? Um...

604

Just stay calm. I can explain.

I've already... Get off me.

(CLATTERING) Thank you.

Look, he, he... he attacked me.

610
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:56,084
What? I, I came in
to check on the engine.

611
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,962
I just flipped that switch
there and it just turned on.

612
00:51:59,004 --> 00:52:01,464
They're not broken, Jess.
He was lying to us.

613
00:52:02,674 --> 00:52:05,176
Why, why,
why would he attack you?

614
00:52:05,218 --> 00:52:07,971
I don't know. I mean, he
smashed my head into that thing.

615
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,433
Look, we, we need
to move him, OK?

616
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:14,561
We need to, we need to tie him up
or something, before he wakes up.

617
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:37,876
Why were you looking
at the engines anyway?

618
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:42,297
Because I didn't
trust they were broken.

619

He drugged you, Jess.

620

Ben wouldn't do something like that.

621
00:52:50,263 --> 00:52:54,476
I saw it, Jess.
You were... You were passed out.

622
00:52:56,936 --> 00:53:00,106
But we all took that stuff together.
I didn't.

I need your help.
