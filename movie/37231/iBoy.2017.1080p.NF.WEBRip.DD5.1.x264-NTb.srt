1
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,650
看起来好像是黑帮闯入
<i>And it looks like gangs are in.</i>

2
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:25,400
- ...十五岁男孩...  - 哈喽？
<i>- ...fifteen-year-old boy...  - Hello?</i>

3
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,067
...增加资金，警方介入失败了
<i>...increase in funding, police intervention has failed</i>

4
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,525
致使犯罪率显著下降
<i>to provoke a significant reduction in crime statistics.</i>

5
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,983
暴力侵入文化
<i>invasive culture of violence.</i>

6
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,192
汤姆
Tom.

7
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:23,150
- 汤姆，忙啥呢？  - 一切都好吧，丹尼？
- Tom, what's happening?  - You all right, Danny?

8
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,858
嗨，别说我啥都没为你做过。
Yo, don't say I never do nothing for ya.

9
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:27,275
哎呀，酷毙了
Oh, sweet.

10
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:34,150
- 这谁呀？  - 我可没说这手机不是二手的
- Who's that?  - I didn't say it weren't secondhand.

11
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,067
今天上午我们要复习你们修改过的题签
This morning, we're gonna go over your revision sheets

12
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,192
并且要检查一下考试准备情况
and take a look at exam prep.

13
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,442
如果我们不能达到60%的合格率
If we don't hit the 60 percent pass rate,

14
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:46,067
那我们可得一起在就业中心排很长时间队了
we're gonna be spending a lot more time together in queue at the job center.

15
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,567
汤姆，你复习咋样了？
So, Tom, how did you get on with the exercises?

16
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:51,775
汤姆
Tom.

17
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,525
哦...
Uh...

18
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,733
- 三角形？  - 什么？
- Triangles?  - What?

19
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,817
好吧，艾琳, 你复习怎么样了？
Okay, Eileen, what about you?

20
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,275
都复习好了，就一件事儿我还没...
Yeah, it was all right. One thing I didn't under...

21
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,733
哥们，有时候看到你让我觉得很痛苦
Man, it's painful watching you sometimes.

22
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,317
- 你痛苦啥呀?  - 她
- What?  - This.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,275
大家都知道你一直喜欢露西・沃克
Everyone knows you've fancied Lucy Walker since forever.

24
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,567
你就不能爷们点把这事搞定吗？
Just man up and get it done, all right?

25
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,275
哎，她来了，这可是你给她留下好印象的大好机会啊
Ooh, here she comes. This could be your big chance to impress her.

26
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:18,442
所以，确保你能说出一些非常酷的话。
So, make sure you say something really, really cool.

27
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:20,900
- 请你走开吧  - 汤姆
- Go away, please.  - Tom.

28
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:23,400
- 嗨  - 嘿，你复习完科学课没？
- Hey.  - Uh, did you get the science revision?

29
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:26,067
- 复习完了。  - 我是说你都复习好了吗？
<i>- Yeah.  - No, I mean, like, did you get it?</i>

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,067
- 我觉得我复习好了  - 酷
- Oh, did I get it? Yeah, I think so.  - Cool.

31
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,150
快看啊，小汤米和女孩说个话都紧张出汗了。
Look at Tommy boy. He's getting moist just talking to a girl.

32
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:36,400
- 白痴啊你，尤金?  - 你啾啥？
- Still a dickhead, Eugene?  - What are you looking at?

33
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,150
滚一边去
Fuck off.

34
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,442
你能帮我复习科学课不
So, anyway, um, the science revision. I, uh, was wondering if you could help me

35
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:47,108
我本来想自己复习，可是我发现我好像从2011年开始就没好好学过科学课了。
'cause I tried looking at it, and then I remembered I haven't paid attention in science since, like, 2011.

36
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,733
看看我能做什么。
I'll see what I can do.

37
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:52,233
我是说我只能和你一起复习吗，你可不是啥好学生
I mean, I can only work with what I got. You're not exactly a model student.

38
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,442
- 你是在质疑我的学术能力吗？  - 是啊
- Are you questioning my academic prowess?  - I am, yeah.

39
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,608
好吧，我放学后要先见查理，然后晚点过去，行不？
All right, well, I'm seeing Charlie after school, but come by later, yeah?

40
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:00,692
行
Sure.

41
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:06,192
- 查理・吉布斯 还是 查理・潘福特?  - 哦, 查理・吉布斯。
- Charlie Gibbs or Charlie Penford?  - Uh, Charlie Gibbs. As in Charlotte?

42
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,775
好像在夏洛特我有好几个月没见过查理・潘福特了。
I haven't seen Charlie Penford in months.

43
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,525
好，当然，我的意思是这显然不关我事。
Right, of course. I mean, it's none of my business, obviously.

44
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
一会见
I'll see you later then.

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,983
一会见，露西...
See you, Lucy, later... See you later, Lucy.

46
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,108
往里面放点蔬菜汤...
<i>Put here some vegetable stock...</i>

47
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,733
警方调查...
<i>Police investigation con...</i>

48
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:28,775
什么事让你这么烦躁?
What are you so fidgety about?

49
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,733
如果有人对你说晚点过来，
If someone said for you to come around later,

50
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:34,233
你觉得应该是几点？
what time would you say that was?

51
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:35,650
晚到什么程度？
Later than what?

52
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:40,025
不是特别晚，比如8点
Than earlier. Like, eight, do you think, maybe?

53
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:42,358
那已经足够晚了。
Well, that's certainly later on than earlier.

54
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,817
- 你写什么呢？  - 浪漫小说。
- What you writing?  - A romance novel.

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
- 又是浪漫小说。  - 是啊。
- They're all romance novels.  - Yes, they are.

56
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:51,358
你想听我给你读一段吗？
Would you like to hear some?

57
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,442
不想听。
I don't think so.

58
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,542
- “菲利普...”  - 噢，奶奶。
- "Philip..."  - Oh, Nan.

59
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,317
关上门然后解开他衬衫上的扣子。
"Closed the door behind him and undid the buttons of his shirt.

60
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,733
他解开腰带放开他鼓胀的...
He unbuckled his belt and released his engorged... ".

61
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,317
老天爷啊，我走了。
Oh, Jesus. I'm going.

62
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:30,483
露西？
Lucy?

63
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:44,608
走吧哥们
Let's go, man.

64
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,067
嗨！站住！
Hey! Stop!

65
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,608
应急中心。需要什么服务？
<i>Emergency. Which service?</i>

66
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,500
奇机少年

68
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:58,775
奶奶？
Nan?

69
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:05,942
这是你的电话。
This is your phone.

70
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:10,192
子弹是不是没有打到重要的部位？
Did it miss all the important bits?

71
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,400
这是大脑
Well, it's a brain,

72
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:14,192
所以我们都倾向于认为它是相当重要的
so we tend to think of all of it as quite important.

73
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,400
- 但一切都会好的是吧？  - 希望如此。
- But it will be okay?  - We hope so.

74
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,880
这里和这里的颞叶不见了。（颞叶负责处理听觉信息，也与记忆和情感有关）
Fragments here and here missed the temporal lobe

75
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,048
而听觉合成于...
and the auditory complex by milli...

76
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,358
我朋友在这里吗?
Is my friend in here?

77
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,233
露西回家了,亲爱的。她大约一个星期前出院了。
Lucy's gone home, love. She was discharged about a week ago.

78
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:30,525
你已经昏迷快十天了，汤姆。
You've been out for nearly ten days, Tom.

79
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:31,442
当时，
At the moment,

80
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,358
让我们担心的是没有任何办法可以移除那些东西。
nothing in there is moving around in any way that worries us.

81
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:37,358
- 你非常走运。  - 会不会有后遗症？
- You were very lucky.  - Will there be, like, side effects?

82
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:40,483
我们会继续观察，但如果有任何异常发生
We're gonna keep an eye on you, but if anything unusual happens,

83
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,400
我要你立即告诉我。
I want you to let me know straightaway.

84
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:46,692
- 异常？怎么样的异常？  - 就是异常。
- Unusual, like, how?  - Just unusual.

85
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,608
我当时应该做些什么。
I should've done something.

86
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,358
你当时已经尽力了，亲爱的。
You did the only thing you could, love.

87
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,150
- 你见过她了？  - 没有。
- Have you seen her?  - No.

88
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,275
这将需要一段时间，汤姆。
It'll take a while, Tom.

89
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,442
你发现我孙子有什么特别吗？
Is there something about my grandson you find particularly fascinating?

90
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,275
- 没有  - 那就别TM一直盯着他看。
- No, no, no.  - Well, stop bloody staring at him, then.

91
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,442
看起来他像是在战争中受过伤。
Looks like he's been in the wars.

92
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:18,608
多谢你的医学意见。
Well, thank you for your considered medical opinion.

93
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,067
也许下次我会找个医生来开车，然后让你去做手术。
Maybe, next time, I'll get the doctor to drive us and you to do the operation.

94
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,942
- 怎么样？  - 别激动，亲爱的。
- How about that?  - Calm down, love.

95
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,275
我就是随便说说。
It's only an observation.

96
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,275
你感觉如何？
So, how you feeling?

97
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,358
- 你脑袋咋样了？  - 还好。
- How's the head?  - It's all right.

98
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,108
- 它看起来怎么样？  - 看起来已经好多了。
- How's it look?  - Already, it looks better.

99
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,650
我们应该让这边和那边一样高一点。
We need to even this up a bit.

100
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,733
如果你觉得应付的来的话，也许你应该去见见露西。
You know, if you feel up to it, maybe later you should go to Lucy.

101
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:16,108
- 她不会想见我的。  - 她肯定会见你的。
- No, she's not gonna want to see me.  - Of course, she is.

102
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,650
我当时跑开了，奶奶。
I ran away, Nan.

103
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:22,192
任何人从那个公寓里跑开都会被原谅的，汤姆。
Anyone could be forgiven for running out of that flat, Tom.

104
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:27,108
但在她真正需要的时候一直躲的远远的
But someone who kept running afterwards when she really needed them?

105
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,525
那就是懦夫。
That would be a coward.

106
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,108
我的意思是这太他妈的混蛋了，谁说的？
I mean, what a fucking asshole. Who says that?

107
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,483
我的意思是他说他会打电话给我。
I mean, come on. He said he was gonna call me.

108
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,108
然后等我看到他的时候，他说他电话没钱了。
Then, when I saw him, he said he was out of credit.

109
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,608
我知道，他还有别人。
I know. He's on a contract.

110
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:41,817
是的，我确信他肯定还有别人。
<i>Yeah, I know for a fact he's definitely on a contract.</i>

111
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,983
- 对吗？  - 是啊，哦上帝啊，太TM混蛋了。
<i>- Right?  - Yeah. Oh, my God, what a prick.</i>

112
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,567
一个小子正盯着我看。
<i>Now, some boy is staring at me.</i>

113
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,483
- 哦，妈的，那是被他们射中的那个小子。  - 他看起来怎么样?
<i>- Oh, shit, it's that kid they shot.  - How's he look?</i>

114
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:51,233
不好。
Not good.

115
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,692
- 你上几楼？  - 5楼。
- What floor you want?  - Five.

116
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,108
花不错。
Nice flowers.

117
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,275
给你奶奶的？
For your nan?

118
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,608
噢，你看起来真狼狈。
Oh, you look like shit.

119
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,317
替我们向露西问好，好吗？
Say hello to Lucy from us, yeah?

120
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,275
我先去看看她，好吧？
Let me go and check on her first, all right?

121
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:42,317
你没事吧，本？
You all right, Ben?

122
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,858
你没事吧，汤姆？
You all right, Tom?

123
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,900
她在她自己的房间里，汤姆。
She's in her room, Tom.

124
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,817
我很高兴你没有死。
I'm glad you're not dead.

125
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:05,608
谢谢。
Thanks.

126
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:08,858
我也很高兴你没死。
Same.

127
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,692
他们给了你很多药吧?
They've given you lots of drugs?

128
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,900
是啊，肯定是这样。这事有点迷糊。
Yeah, must've done. Things have been a bit trippy.

129
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,108
- 对不起，露西。  - 没关系。
- I'm sorry, Luce.  - It's okay.

130
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,108
不，这...这有关系。
No, it's... it's not.

131
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:26,733
不能让他们就这么跑了。
They won't get away with it.

132
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:29,858
他们已经跑了。
They already have.

133
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,233
我当时应该做点什么。
I should've done something.

134
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,858
- 是吗？做什么？  - 我不应该跑开。
- Yeah? Like what?  - I shouldn't have run.

135
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,067
没人因为你没当英雄而生你的气。
No one's mad at you for not being a hero.

136
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:20,608
汤姆？
Tom?

137
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,775
- 汤姆？  - 我没事，奶奶。
- Tom?  - I'm fine, Nan.

138
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,608
你吓着我了。
You're frightening me.

139
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,692
- 我要给医生打电话。  - 我真没事。
- I'm gonna call the doctor.  - I'm fine, seriously.

140
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,525
我只是需要睡一会。
I just need to get some sleep.

141
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
20:03  尤金iPhone接入

142
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,192
- 他来了。  - 早晨好。
- There he is.  - Morning.

143
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:17,483
- 你睡得好吗，亲爱的？  - 是的，很好。
- You sleep all right, love?  - Yeah, good.

144
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:20,150
嗯，你看起来好些了。
All right. Well, you look better.

145
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:21,900
露西昨天怎么样?
How was Lucy yesterday?

146
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:24,900
和以前不太一样。
Different.

147
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:28,275
是啊，所以你昨天才那样反常。
Yeah. So were you.

148
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,192
想想如果你妈妈还和我们在一起,
Keep thinking if your mum was still with us,

149
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,955
她一定会踹开门冲出去，
she'd be out there now, kicking doors down,

150
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:34,817
把那个向你开枪的小杂种找出来。
trying to find the little bastards that did that to you.

151
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,650
汤姆！
Tom!

152
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,067
- 你干啥呢？  - 今天是周一。
- What are you doing?  - It's Monday.

153
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,983
你刚刚被击中头部。
You've just been shot in the head.

154
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,525
我想学校一定会让你歇几天。
I think they'll give you a bit of time off school.

155
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:50,775
这是考试...还是世界末日。
It's exams... or doom.

156
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,733
别惹麻烦。
Well, stay out of trouble.

157
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,233
汤姆。
Tom.

158
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,400
轻点。
Easy.

159
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,358
我靠，你脑袋刚被射了一枪这么快就能走动了。
Shit. You took a head shot and you're already walking.

160
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,567
他们真的不得不把电话残片从你脑袋里摘除？
Is it true they had to pull bits of phone outta your brain?

161
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,442
- 我想大部分还在我脑袋里。  - 哥们，我...
- Left most of it in there, I think.  - Mate, I am...

162
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:10,366
还好你没变成植物人。
I am glad you ain't a vegetable.

163
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,192
- 谢谢，丹尼。  - 等等，我知道你不会去上学。
- Thanks, Danny.  - Wait, I know you're not going to school.

164
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,817
- 我是要去上学。  - 这个头部外伤真被你浪费了，哥们。
- I thought I might.  - Head trauma is wasted on you, mate.

165
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,025
丹尼，能问你点事不？
Danny, can I ask you something?

166
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,525
我啥也不知道。没人知道是谁干的。
I don't know anything about it. No one on the estate does.

167
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:22,442
是的，但是...
Yeah, but...

168
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:25,525
兄弟，忘了这件事，就让它过去吧。
Bruv, just forget about it now and move on.

169
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:28,900
我认为尤金当时在场。
I think Eugene was there.

170
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:31,900
尤金？得了，哥们。
Eugene? Come on, man.

171
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:35,025
那家伙要当坏孩子，但他还是有底线的，你知道吗？
The guy wants to be a bad boy, but he's got a line, you know?

172
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:39,067
- 是的，但如果他当时真在场呢？我该怎么做？  - 听着，他当时不在场。
- Yeah, but what if he was? What do I do?  - Look, he wasn't there.

173
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,858
这一切都结束了。
That's all there is to it. Come on.

174
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:12,817
- 汤姆？汤姆！  - 啥？
- Tom? Tom!  - Huh?

175
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,650
你听到我说啥没？今天的聚会。
Did you hear what I said? Party tonight.

176
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:22,275
- 哦，没听着。  - 是啊，他可能没有邀请你。
- Oh. Hadn't heard about it.  - Yeah, he might not have invited you.

177
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,039
大家还都认为你仍处于昏迷中。
Everyone still thinks you're in a coma now.

178
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,483
- 是啊。  - 但你应该去。
- Right.  - But you should come.

179
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,692
- 咋的？你不去学校？  - 孩子，有人已经帮我把所有事都做好了。
- What? You're not going to school?  - They've done all they can for me, son.

180
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:36,108
- 但我会在那里看到你，对吧？  - 我去那呆一会吧。
- But I'll see you there, yeah?  - In a bit.

181
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:33,525
不！
<i>No!</i>

182
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
不！
<i>No!</i>

183
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:52,483
卧槽。
Ah, fuck.

184
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,025
- 尤金，拿开。  - 闭嘴！
- Eugene, put that away now.  - Shut up, man!

185
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,775
大家安静。
Excuse me, everyone. Quiet down.

186
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:59,192
- 这很好笑，是不是？  - 尤金。
- It's funny, innit?  - Eugene.

187
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,835
你知道还有什么别的事可笑吗? 我知道你住哪，你个小...
You know what else is funny? I know where you live, you little...

188
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,650
- 哥们，你还是来了。  - 是啊。
- Bruv, you made it.  - Yeah.

189
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,608
感觉咋样？你脑袋没事吧？
How you feeling? How's your head?

190
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,025
你TM啾啥，汤姆？
What the fuck you staring at, Tom?

191
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:49,983
你啾啥，汤姆？
What you staring at, Tom?

192
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,827
- 你TM到底...？  - 好了，尤金。
- What the fuck are you...?  - All right, Eugene.

193
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,567
- 冷静，哥们，冷静。  - 马上让他出去。
- Chill out, bruv. Hey, just chill out.  - Get him out of here now.

194
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,192
- 放松，冷静。  - 把他送回保姆那里去，哥们。
- Relax. Chill out.  - Take him back to Nanny, bruv.

195
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,900
- 我会解决的，冷静。  - 好啊，快解决好，丹尼
- I'll sort it. Just chill.  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort it, Danny.

196
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,275
你咋回事？
What's the matter with you?

197
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:11,733
你想在脑袋上再开个洞啊？
Do you want another hole in your head?

198
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,817
你在这挑起战争你是不会赢的。
You start a fight in there, you ain't gonna win it.

199
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,192
他们当时在那里。
They were there.

200
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,150
- 你说啥呢？  - 他们当时在露西家。
- What you talking about?  - At Lucy's.

201
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,692
你啥时候能用脑子想想他们不是那些人？
When are you gonna get it through your head that this wasn't them?

202
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:25,400
你说话的口气仿佛你不是他们中的一员。
You talk like you're not one of them.

203
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,483
我知道他们已经把你给卖了。你认为这不会逐步升级吗?
I know they've already got you selling. What, you think this won't escalate?

204
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,275
别当白痴,汤姆。
Don't be a dickhead about it, Tom.

205
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,942
我做我想要做的。
I'm doing what I want.

206
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:37,650
你明白吗？总有一天，我会高高在上发号施令，
You get that? You know what? One day, it'll be me at the top giving out orders,

207
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,692
而不是这些混蛋，就是生意罢了。
and it won't be none of this shit, just business.

208
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,483
汤姆，你知道吗，我不会永远这样的。
Tom, I can't always be there, you know.

209
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:10,000
汤姆：嗨，是我，你醒了吗？

210
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
露西：是的，一直醒着，你在哪？

211
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:36,900
你闻起来像杂草。
You smell like weed.

212
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:38,775
你带什么了吗？
You got any?

213
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,608
- 两手空空的到这来。  - 对不起。
- Comes out here empty-handed.  - Sorry.

214
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:50,650
- 聚会怎么样？  - 还好，没有错过太多。
- How was the party?  - It was all right. Didn't miss much.

215
00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:54,692
你感觉怎么样？
How you feeling?

216
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:57,817
挺好。
Good.

217
00:22:58,692 --> 00:22:59,692
是吗？
Yeah?

218
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,150
- 是啊。  - 那挺好。
- Yeah.  - That's good.

219
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,192
可能你很快就能回学校了。
Maybe you'll be able to come back to school soon.

220
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,067
- 可能吧。  - 没有你学校挺无聊的。
- Yeah, maybe.  - Boring without you there.

221
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,775
没人在餐厅扔薯片了。
Got no one to throw chips at in the canteen.

222
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:21,733
- 好像你从来不向我扔薯片似的。  - 是啊，你能怎么样?
- Like you'd ever dare throw chips at me.  - Yeah, what would you do about it?

223
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,650
那还用说,给你一个耳光。
Give you a slap, obviously.

224
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,608
那你得先找个椅子站上去。
You'd have to find a chair to stand on first.

225
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:34,567
等我当着大家的面这样做的时候 你会后悔刚才说过的这些话
You're gonna regret all this talk when I'm owning you in front of everyone.

226
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,233
好吧，我不会太介意的。
Okay. I wouldn't mind that so much.

227
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:57,650
会慢慢好起来的
It's gonna be all right, you know.

228
00:23:58,775 --> 00:23:59,775
是啊
Yeah.

229
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:29,275
未知发信人：我来找你了

230
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:31,900
接下来，你有虚拟专用网
<i>Next up, you have virtual private network.</i>

所有从web服务器获取的页面

232

五个步骤远程黑入域名服务器
<i>Five steps to remotely hack into a DNS server.</i>

233
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:42,733
PHP网站命令行执行环境和偷渡病毒
<i>PHP Web Shell and Stealth.</i>

234
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,192
- 冷静，哥们  - 算了，老兄，没时间冷静
- Just chill out, bruv.  - Naw, man. No time to chill.

235
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,992
访问中...

236
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:11,192
入侵中...

238
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000

239
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,983
- 很高兴见到你，卡滋  - 最近怎么样？
- Good seeing you, Cutz.  - What's going on?

240
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:40,525
不错,是吗?
<i>Cool, yeah?</i>

241
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,858
这里有半块。确保你能...？
Half a brick there, yeah. Sure you can...?

242
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,233

- Why are you leaning on my car for, fam?  - Cutz, man...

243
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:47,650
从TM车上滚下去。
<i>Get off the fucking car.</i>

244
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,317
- 你确定你能处理好？  - 哥们，这小菜一碟。
- You sure you can handle it, yeah?  - Well, it's easy, man.

245
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,067
哦，对不起。我们从现在开始应该和你谈吗?
Oh, I'm sorry. Should we start talking to you now?

246
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,650
站那边去，范
Stand over there, fam.

247
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,325
他人不错，听我说，卡滋，他人不错
He's cool. Listen. All right, Cutz. He's cool.

248
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,775
- 别担心他  - 你确定吗？
- Don't worry about him.  - Are you sure?

249
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,275
是，是，他人不错
Yeah, yeah. He's cool, he's cool.

250
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:04,983
- 走路小心点，范  - 我会立刻给你打电话
- Mind how you lot go, fam.  - Yeah, I'll bell you straightaway.

251

- Safe, Cutz.  - Safe.

253

What?

256
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,650
- 我会给你打电话  - 放心吧，卡滋
- I'll bell you.  - Safe, Cutz.

257
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:34,275
咱们走吧
Let's go.

258
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,567
- 你偷听我们说话，哥们  - 卧槽，哥们
- You're bugging out, bruv.  - Fuck, bruv.

259
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,858
傻X，找死啊！
Bruv, what the fuck!

260
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,858
未知发信人：嗨 露西，你现在感觉怎么样？

261
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,858
你谁呀？

262
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,858
- 未知发信人：我是一个朋友。  - 露西：你怎么知道我号码的？  -未知发信人：我在帮你盯着他们呢

263
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:35,525
怪胎
Weirdo.

264
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,483
你喝茶不？亲爱的
I wondered if you wanted some tea, love.

265
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:46,025
- 汤姆？  - 茶？ 是的，要喝。
- Tom?  - Tea? Yeah, cool.

266
00:28:49,358 --> 00:28:50,400
好的
Okay.

267
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,817
妈妈！
<i>Mom!</i>

268
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,525
谁TMD在那玩灯呢？
<i>Who's fucking with the lights?</i>

269
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,983
救命！
<i>Help!</i>

270
00:29:57,858 --> 00:29:59,192
嘿！什么他妈的...
<i>Hey! What the fuck...</i>

271
00:30:00,692 --> 00:30:01,817
O!#@&*
<i>Yes! Oh!</i>

272
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:23,650
嘘！安静一点，请安静！
No, no. Shh! Quiet, please! Hush!

273
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:27,400
安静... 请安静，嘘！
Quiet... Quiet, please. Shh!

274
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:30,150
谢谢...嘘！安静！谢谢。
Thank... Shh! Hush! Thank you.

275
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:34,567
今天早晨的“今日遐思”
So, for this morning's thought of the day,

276
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,775
要和你们讨论一下未来计划
we will be discussing with you future planning.

277
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:43,317
正如大家所知，这里的许多高年级学生马上就要参加考试了。
Now, as you know, many of the top here will be, uh, taking their exams soon.

278
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,817
考试时间比很多人希望的要早的多。
Much sooner than many of them would like.

279
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,900
- 嘿，你，就是你。  - 但总是在这... 嘘！
- Hey, yo, that's you.  - But it's always at this... Shh!

280
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:52,108
总是在每年的这个时候。
It's always at this time of year,

281
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:55,150
当我们准备和你们中的一些人说再见的时候。
as we prepare to say bye-bye to some of you,

282
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:56,817
我的想法变成...
that my thoughts turn to...

283
00:30:57,442 --> 00:31:01,483
摆在我们面前的道路...
to what lies ahead of us on the road to...

284
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:04,025
嗯,那啥。请大家安静。
Um, okay. Everybody, quiet, please.

285
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,067
当我们... 请安静！
As we... Quiet, please!

286
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,775
孩子们，保持冷静！都坐下！
Boys, stay calm! Just sit down!

287
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:15,775
坐下！我让你们都坐下！
Sit! I said sit down!

288
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,650
你们都克制点！
Control yourselves!

289
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,942
大家安静！
Everybody, quiet!

290
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:22,567
哦，我的上帝啊！停止播放视频！
Oh, my good God! Stop the video!

291
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,525
别他妈的放视频了！让他们出去！
Stop the fucking video! Get them out!

292
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:31,858
拿下来！所有人都出去！出去！
Take it down! Everybody out! Out!

293
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:33,150
哈里斯先生就站在那里
<i>Mr. Harris was just standing there</i>

294
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,817
身后的大投影屏播放卡斯打灰机的视频。
with this huge projection of Cass behind him just jerking off.

295
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,400
大家都疯了。所有人都在尖叫。
Everyone goes, like, crazy. Everyone's screaming and stuff.

296
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:41,025
卡斯满脸通红直接跑出去了
Cass goes bright red, just, like, runs straight out of there.

297
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,400
太有意思了
It was so funny.

298
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,858
老天啊，咋会发生这种事？
God, how did that even happen?

299
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,483
母鸡
Don't know.

300
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,817
- 想听音乐不？  - 行
- Should we listen to some music?  - Sure.

301
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:01,483
- 听CD？Are You Serious？（DeadToFall演唱的专辑）  - 哦，那都是我妈妈的
- CDs? Are you serious?  - Oh, they're my mom's.

302
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
露西：那是你，是不？

303
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,733
嗯，她的品味挺有意思
Well, she's got interesting taste.

304
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,000
- 露西：那是你，是不？  - 未知发信人：我什么？

305
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:11,775
- 听唐的歌行不？  - 行
- What about Tongue?  - Yeah.

306
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,775
露西：给黑帮捣乱的人。你知道是他们干的，对吧？

307
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,000
未知发信人：他们为什么袭击你？

308
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:26,775
露西：他们被告知说我弟弟不肯加入他们的黑帮所以就发生了这事。

309
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,775
未知发信人：谁告诉他们的？

310
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,275
露西：我怎么知道？

311
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,775
露西：所以你要告诉我你的名字吗？

312
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,775
未知发信人：你可以叫我iBOY

313
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,775
露西：那太荒唐了

314
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:45,775
iBOY：你有男朋友吗？

315
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,775
露西：这和我所讲的有关系吗？

316
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,775
iBOY：你有喜欢的人吗？

317
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,635
露西：我认为这一点也不浪漫

318
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,275
想去吃晚餐不？
Do you want to go to dinner?

319
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,983
- 晚餐？  - 是的，吃的啥的。
- Dinner?  - Yeah, food or something.

320
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,692
- 好啊  - 好
- Yeah, okay.  - Okay.

321
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,067
太好了
Great.

322
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:19,108
不，不，那...那不对
No, no, that... that can't be right.

323
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:21,112
上个月我付了300
I paid 300 last month.

324
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,231
是的，嗯，对不起
<i>Yeah, well, I'm sorry,</i>

325
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,900
但我们的系统是百分百准确的
<i>but our system is a hundred percent accurate.</i>

326
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:26,525
你错过了付款时间，总共600磅，所以...
<i>You've missed your payments, which total 600 pounds, so...</i>

327
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:30,317
噢，噢，你们的系统说是啥就是啥，是不？
<i>Oh, oh, let's just all bow down to whatever your system says, shall we?</i>

328
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,608
你能帮我再查一下不？
<i>Can you check it again for me?</i>

329
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:34,317
听着，如果你现在就付这600磅
<i>Look, if you can pay the 600 now,</i>

330
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,317
那么我们就不再增加利息
<i>then we can stop the added interest on the account,</i>

331
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,858
但在那之前，我很忙。
<i>but until then, my hands are tied.</i>

332
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:41,108
年轻人，我没有600磅
<i>Young man, I don't have 600 pounds.</i>

333
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:43,567
我没有300磅
<i>I don't have 300 pounds.</i>

334
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,608
我已经付了300磅，是你们把它弄丢了
<i>You have my 300 pounds, but you've lost it.</i>

335
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,108
- 现在我要去和...  - 等等
<i>- Now, I'd like to speak to...  - Wait, hold on.</i>

336
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:51,858
系统显示钱已经付过了，帐已经清了
<i>It's saying the payment's been made. The account's coming up as cleared.</i>

337
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,108
- 我想这可能是一个错误。  - 噢，一个错误？
<i>- I think this might be an error.  - Oh, an error?</i>

338
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:56,108
我认为系统是百分百准确的？
I thought the system was a hundred percent accurate?

339
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,108
等一下
Hold on a minute.

340
00:34:00,358 --> 00:34:01,358
对
Right.

341
00:34:02,608 --> 00:34:05,650
我不认为我可以靠运河船为生
I don't reckon I could live on a canal boat.

342
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:08,858
- 为什么不呢？  - 这太low了
- Why not?  - It's too low down.

343
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:12,233
我真希望透过窗户能看到整个城市和普通人
I really like being able to see all of the city and the little people

344
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,483
out my window.

345
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,192
那些鸭子很奇怪。
Plus, ducks are weird.

346
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:21,900
- 靠，它们过来了  - 别
- Shit, they're coming.  - No!

347
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:24,650
- 嘎嘎！  - 快停下！我要把你踹进去。
- Quack!  - Stop it! I'll kick you in.

348
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:34,483
其实到公寓外面呆会儿挺好
It's actually really nice getting out of the flat for a little bit.

349
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,692
我妈一直盯着我
My mum just watches me constantly.

350
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:42,150
好象她认为我会从阳台上跳下去。
It's like she thinks I'm gonna throw myself off the balcony or something.

351
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,233
我从来都不是受害人
I've never been the victim.

352
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,275
感觉有点不对
It doesn't feel right.

353
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,817
- 我没看出来你那样啊  - 你有
- I don't see you like that.  - Yeah, you do.

354
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:56,108
但这没什么
But it's all right.

355
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,608
你会到那里
You'll get there.

356
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:06,400
不同于任何人
You know, out of everyone,

357
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:10,775
你是唯一来看我的
you're the only person who has come to see me.

358
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:15,525
- 露西，那天到底发生了什么？  - 汤姆...
- Luce, what happened?  - Tom...

359
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:18,192
不，我... 我只是...
No, I... I just...

360
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,817
我想让你知道你能...
I want you to know you can...

361
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:26,192
当我在你身边的时候我想让你有安全感
I want you to feel safe when I'm around.

362
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:27,275
我的意思是
What I mean is,

363
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,233
如果我们再有麻烦，我想让你知道我不会再跑开了。
if we were in trouble again, I want you to know that I wouldn't run this time.

364
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:31,608
我要留下来。
I'd stay.

365
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:33,983
即使我会死，我也会...
Even if it meant I'd die, I'd just...

366
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:37,442
我就是想要你知道这些
I just want you to know that.

367
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:43,692
好的
Okay.

368
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,192
我也是
Same.

369
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,650
我有没有告诉过你 当我被锁在外面
Did I ever tell you about when I got locked out

370
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,817
整晚在你的屋顶上和，噢，她叫什么来着？
on your roof overnight with, uh, what's-her-face?

371
00:35:54,942 --> 00:35:56,192
- 不  - 爱丽丝
- No.  - Alice.

372
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:58,692
你知道爱丽丝吗？她坐在你的左边...
Do you know Alice? She sat, like, left of you in...

373
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,150
- 上数学课的时候？  - 我想是的
- math?  - I think so.

374
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,913
我们当时认为坐在那里是个相当好的主意，而且...
We thought it'd be a really good idea to go and sit up there, and...

375
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:03,942
露西！
Lucy!

376
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:06,942
- 噢，我靠  - 你没事吧？
- Oh, shit.  - You all right?

377
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:08,942
没事
Yeah?

378
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,650
听说了发生在你和本身上的事。
Heard about what happened to you and Ben.

379
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:15,025
那事儿搞砸了，你知道的。但是他们会明白正在面对的是什么。
That's messed up, you know. But they'll get what's coming to 'em.

380
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:17,400
- 我向你保证  - 是的
- I promise you that.  - Right.

381
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:21,275
你不认为这与我们有关,对不？
You don't think it's nothing to do with us, do ya?

382
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,900
- 为什么我会这么认为？  - 我们确实和这事无关
- Why would I think that?  - No, exactly.

383
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:28,942
因为，你知道，自从这事发生后
'Cause, you know, since it happened,

384
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:32,692
有些小滑头一直和我们玩这些幼稚的游戏。
some little prick has been playing these childish games with us.

385
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,304
但这件事你啥也不知道，是不，露西？
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Luce?

386
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:38,692
是的
No.

387
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,483
- 因为我认为你可能...  - 放开她,尤金。
- 'Cause I think you might...  - Leave it, Eugene.

388
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,692
- 你想咋滴，汤姆？  - 我想咋滴？
- What about you, Tom?  - What about me?

389
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:53,442
你一直对露西有意思，对不？
You've always had a thing for Lucy, ain't ya?

390
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:57,733
- 你就是一个呆子  - 我不是呆子
- And you're a geek.  - I'm not a geek.

391
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,358
但你看起来就是个呆子
But you look like a geek.

392
00:37:01,817 --> 00:37:03,483
你个小混蛋，你就是呆子，对不？
You little shit, it's you, innit?

393
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,858
- 未知发信人：找错人了 白痴
- UNKNOWN: WRONG GUY DICKHEADS
- 这他妈啥？我们都收到了
- What the fuck? - Got us all.

394
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:10,942
- 未知发信人：找错人了 白痴
- UNKNOWN: WRONG GUY DICKHEADS
是啊
Yeah.

395
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:14,733
卧槽 他在哪？
Fuck, man. Where is he?

396
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,067
我告诉过你，哈泽德，哥们！
I told you, Hazzard, bruv!

397
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,900
出来！马上出来！
Come out! Come out now!

398
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,567
我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

399
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,025
今天的事谢谢你
Thank you for today.

400
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:52,608
弟兄们，这有辆whip
This is the whip, boys.

401
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:54,983
- 你知道怎么弄吗？  - 当然知道
- You know how to do this one, yeah?  - Of course.

402
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:04,067
- 先生想开车吗？  - 嗯，是的
- Would sir like to take a drive?  - Oh, sir would.

403
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:07,025
- 发动汽车，尤金  - 冷静点，哥们
- Yo, start the car, Eugene, bruv.  - Calm yourself down, man.

404
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:09,108
贮物箱里啥都没有，范，连个太阳镜都没有
Nothing in the glove compartment, fam, not even sunglasses.

405
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:11,608
嘿，哈泽德，检查一下仪表盘
Hey, Hazzard, check the dash, bruv.

406
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,275
我求求你，快点，再不快点他们就要下车了，哥们
I beg you, hurry up, bruv, or they'll be out here, man.

407
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,775
- 看我发动一个高尔夫  - 比这更好的车我都发动过，哥们
- "Watch me start a Golf."  - I've started better cars, man.

408
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:17,858
别催我，别...
Don't rush me, don't...

409
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:19,192
你啥车也没启动过，哥们
You've started no cars, man.

410
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:22,483
给我，给我
Give me that, give me that.

411
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,650
这个不太一样，哥们
It's different in here, man.

412
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,650
你为啥锁门？
Why you locking the door?

413
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,373
我TMD没锁门，哈泽德
I didn't lock the fucking door, Haz, man.

414
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:30,567
- 闭嘴，我没锁门  - 哦，你没锁门吗？
- Shut your mouth. I didn't lock the door.  - Oh, you didn't lock the door?

415
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,731
我发誓我真TMD没锁门！
I swear down I didn't lock the door for fucking fuck!

416
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:35,775
我没锁门！我向你们发誓...
I didn't lock the door! I swear to you...

417
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:37,900
- 你发动引擎了。  - 我TMD没发动！
- You started the engine.  - I didn't fucking start that!

418
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,858
那这是谁干的？
So who done it, then, bruv?

419
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,900
不是我发动的车子！
I didn't start that!

420
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:45,744
- 我知道你们做过什么。  - 这他妈啥？那是谁？
<i>- I know what you did.  - What the fuck? Who is that?</i>

421
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,737
- 你TMD是谁？  - 你为啥加速？
- Who the fuck are you?  - Why are you revving up?

422
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:51,567
- 看我的腿，哥们！  - 别TMD加速车子了，哥们！
- Look at my legs, bruv!  - Stop fucking revving the car, bruv!

423
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,400
嗨，车子冒烟了，范！
Hey, yo, there's smoke coming from the car, fam!

424
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:55,525
把TMD车门打开！车子冒烟了！
Open the fucking door! There's smoke coming out!

425
00:38:57,775 --> 00:39:01,900
- 你们为什么袭击行人？  - 有人让我们这么做的！我们别无选择！
<i>- Why did you attack the Walkers?  - We got told to! We had no choice!</i>

426
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:04,150
他妈的给我闭嘴，卡斯！
Shut the fuck up, Cass, man!

427
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:06,733
谁让你们这么做的？
<i>Who told you to?</i>

428
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,358
- 他妈的给我闭嘴，卡斯！  - 是老板让我们做的！
- Shut the fuck up, Cass!  - It was the boss!

429
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,400
我们不想这么做，对不起！
We didn't want to! We're sorry!

430
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,942
卡斯，我不想和你说第二遍！你TMD给我闭...
Cass, I ain't telling you again! Shut the fuck...

431
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:16,692
你老板是谁？
<i>Who's your boss?</i>

432
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:18,942
- 遮住你的嘴巴！  - 哈泽德！
- Cover your mouth! Cover your mouth!  - Haz! Haz!

433
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,817
- 噢，他妈的！  - 告诉我他的名字！
<i>- Oh, shit!  - Tell me his name!</i>

434
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,692
哈泽德晕过去了，哈泽德！哈泽德！
Haz is gone, man! Haz! Haz!

435
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:28,275
- 告诉我名字  - 我不要死在破高尔夫里，哥们！
<i>- Give me the name.  - I ain't dying in no shitty Golf, bruv!</i>

436
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:30,525
他妈的给我闭嘴！我让你闭嘴！
Shut the fuck up! I told you to shut up!

437
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:31,858
马上告诉我名字！
<i>The name! Now!</i>

438
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,275
是卡滋！是卡滋！
It was Cutz! It was Cutz!

439
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,358
他让我们干的！
He made us do it!

440
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,900
卡滋公寓的位置

441
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,233
科恩，你做啥呢？
Yo, Keon, what you making?

442
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,233
它看起来像什么？谢泼德馅饼，范。
What's it look like? Shepherd's pie, fam.

443
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:41,108
谢泼德馅饼和土豆做的农家馅饼有什么不同？
Yo, what's the difference between shepherd's pie and cottage pie?

444
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:45,150
我不知道，但是肯定胜过你妈妈的农家馅饼。
I don't know, but I would smash your mom's cottage pie.

445
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,400
闭嘴。
Shut up.

446
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:49,233
不，这是土豆，不是吗，哥们？
No, it's the potatoes, innit, man?

447
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:52,775
土豆泥很松软，就像绵羊。那就是谢泼德馅饼。
Mashed potatoes are fluffy, like sheep. Shepherd's pie.

448
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:57,983
农家馅饼有很多土豆，就象农家的屋顶一样。
Cottage pies have them square potatoes, like the roof of a cottage.

449
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,483
- 这家伙...  - 别TMD开玩笑了，哥们。
- This guy...  - Get the fuck out of here, man.

450
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,192
- 松软的土豆  - 放尊重点
- "Fluffy potatoes."  - Behave.

451
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:05,275
你们能停止谈论他妈的馅饼吗？
Would you lot stop talking about fucking pies?

452
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:11,442
而且你们应该知道，区别在于羊肉
And if you must know, the difference is lamb.

453
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:16,108
卡滋，那不是你的车吗？
Yo, Cutz, ain't that your car?

454
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:19,983
是啊
Yeah.

455
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,709
我想他已经把JB掏出来了，哥们
I think he's getting his dick out, bruv.

456
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:29,733
- 是你们干的吗？  - 不是
- Are you lot doing this?  - No, bruv.

457
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:33,567
噢，妈的，他在撒尿。
Oh, shit, he's pissing.

458
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:37,567
X你妈的JB！赶快，哥们
Motherfucking prick! Hurry up, bruv.

459
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:40,483
快点！
Hurry up, man!

460
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:10,733
都TM是皮革的
Proper fucking leather, man.

461
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:12,525
- 闭嘴  - 我只是随便说说
- Shut up, man.  - I'm just saying, man.

462
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:17,858
妈的
Shit.

463
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,108
卧槽
Fuck.

464
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,858
我听说有个家伙...
I heard there was this guy...

465
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:32,025
他要对抗黑帮，就象某种义务警员似的
Who's trying to take on the gangs, like some sort of vigilante or something.

466
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:36,608
嗯，我也听说了
Yeah, heard that as well.

467
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:37,858
太白痴了
What an idiot.

468
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:42,608
嗯，你知道吗，也许这只是开始。
Well, you know, maybe this is just the start.

469
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:45,608
也许他会让这个地方变得更好。
Maybe he's gonna change this place for the better.

470
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:48,817
什么？就靠放火烧汽车和打架？
What? By setting fire to cars and getting into fights?

471
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,483
要想把这地方弄好，他得做更多的事。
To clean this place up, he'll have to do a lot more than that.

472
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:57,400
- 你知道考试吗？  - 嗯
- You know the exams?  - Mm-hmm.

473
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:03,442
嗯，我还一直没回过学校呢，自从...
Well, I haven't been back to school since...

474
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:09,858
我想也许你想一起去。
And I wondered if maybe you wanted to go together.

475
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:14,358
- 去考试？  - 这好像是世界上最无聊的日子。
- To the exams?  - Like, the world's most boring date.

476
00:44:45,358 --> 00:45:02,358
iBoy.net/克劳利_住宅区_清理

477
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,358
发送位置信息到大都会警察局

478
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,900
什么他妈的？
What the fuck, man?

479
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,942
- 你不应该进我的房间  - 你不应该有弹簧刀
- You shouldn't go through my room.  - You shouldn't have flick knives.

480
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,775
- 我们把注意力放在这上怎么样？  - 这纯属扯谈
- How about we focus on that?  - This is bullshit.

481
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:43,733
是吗？
Innit just?

482
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:46,150
- 你晚上去哪了？  - 散步
- Where do you go at night?  - Walking.

483
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:47,942
- 带着这个？  - 不
- With this?  - No.

484
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:50,358
实际上我带刀是为了别人，别人不想带刀上街。
Actually, I took it off someone else. That's one less knife on the street.

485
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:54,150
噢，所以，这是你在尽你的公民义务。
Oh. So, this is you doing your civic duty.

486
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:55,692
可能吧
Maybe.

487
00:47:55,775 --> 00:47:58,358
到底发生什么事了，汤姆？你从来就不擅长处理麻烦
What's happened to you, Tom? You never used to get into trouble,

488
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,608
而且现在又是枪伤又是小刀的。
and now it's all bullet wounds and knives.

489
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:03,775
- 奶奶...  - 到哪才是结束啊，汤姆？
- Nan...  - Well, where does it end, Tom?

490
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:05,942
我来告诉您在哪儿结束吧，监狱或停尸房。
I'll tell you where it ends, jail or the morgue.

491
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:09,567
我想做点什么，奶奶。我想做一些好事。
I'm trying to do something, Nan. I'm trying to do something good.

492
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,942
不，你不是
No, you're not.

493
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,919
事情有点失控，你说没事吧，卡滋?
<i>Things are a little out of control, wouldn't you say, Cutz?</i>

494
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:18,983
我-我知道，老板
I-I know, boss.

495
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,192
我们有一半人在牢房里
<i>Half our boys are in the cells.</i>

496
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:24,358
埃尔曼，我正在解决这件事，相信我
Ellman, I'm gonna sort this out, believe me.

497
00:48:24,442 --> 00:48:27,858
这不是我信不信的问题。这是你信不信的问题。
<i>It's not about what I believe. It's about what you believe.</i>

498
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:30,903
你信不信如果你不能把这事处理好
<i>Do you believe that if you don't make this right,</i>

499
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:32,608
我会让你自己承担后果
<i>I'll hold you personally responsible?</i>

500
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:34,150
是的，当然
Yeah, of course.

501
00:48:34,233 --> 00:48:36,633
你相信吗 如果我让一个人自己承担后果
<i>And do you believe that the man I hold personally responsible</i>

502
00:48:36,692 --> 00:48:39,012
那他就没有多少时间能活了
<i>won't be walking around on this Earth for very much longer?</i>

503
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,775
是，是，我知道
No. No, I don't.

504
00:48:41,858 --> 00:48:45,150
- 你最好把这件事办好  - 我会的，埃尔曼，相信我
<i>- Better make it right, then.  - I will, Ellman, trust me.</i>

505
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:47,442
我会尽快把这事搞掂的，但是...
<i>I'm gonna sort this out as soon as possible, but...</i>

506
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,317
哈喽？
<i>Hello?</i>

507
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,025
现在我有一半兄弟在警察局里
I've got half my boys nicked right now.

508
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:11,525
有人从我的帐户里把钱取走！胆子也太TM大了！
People are taking money from my account! The fucking audacity!

509
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:15,942
我今天就要答案！我要你们使出所有技术手段！
I need answers today! I need every piece of technology!

510
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:20,733
笔记本电脑，手机，任何东西。你要去敲每个人的公寓门。
Laptops, phones, anything. You will knock on everyone's flat.

511
00:49:20,817 --> 00:49:24,692
你自己的妈妈，你表兄妹，你姐妹，我不在乎。
Your own mothers, your cousin, your sister, I don't give a fuck.

512
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:25,775
明白没？
Understood?

513
00:49:25,817 --> 00:49:26,817
明白了
Yeah.

514
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:29,400
- 是的  - 他问你们，明白没？
- Yes.  - He said, do you understand?

515
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:31,900
- 明白了！  - 那你们还站在这干什么？快给我行动起来！
- Yes!  - What you standing here for? Move!

516
00:49:35,567 --> 00:49:36,567
嗨，卡斯
Oi, Cass.

517
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,650
嗨，卡滋
Yo, Cutz.

518
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:41,442
大凯斯，有啥事，哥们？
Big Kees. What you saying, bruv?

519
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:43,775
- 咋滴了？你还好吧？  - 是的，哥们，有啥事？
- What's happening? You all right?  - Yeah, man. What you saying?

520
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:47,317
没啥，我就是想问你个小问题。
Nothing, man, I just wanted to ask you a little question.

521
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,775
你看，如果有人象这样用枪指着你的B脸，嗯？
You see, if someone put a gun to your fucking face like this here, huh?

522
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,067
然后说，“告诉我他的名字”
And said, "Give me names,"

523
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,442
你会说吗？
would you do it?

524
00:49:56,858 --> 00:49:57,858
不
No?

525
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,317
或者如果是一辆着火的车呢？
Or if it was a car and it was burning?

526
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:04,692
你会说吗？你会随口说出我的名字吗？
Would you do that? Would you drop my name?

527
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,608
- 你会说出埃尔曼的名字吗？  - 当然不会。
- What about Ellman?  - Of course not.

528
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:12,692
这不合常理。
It doesn't make sense.

529
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:16,317
尤金和... 他们被抓了
Eugene and... They've been nicked.

530
00:50:18,692 --> 00:50:20,067
你什么事也没有。
And nothing happened to you.

531
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,900
- 我很困惑。  - 你困惑？
- I'm confused as well.  - You're confused?

532
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,483
很酷，伙计。做你的事情。
It's cool, man. Do your thing.

533
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,817
你是对的，哥们，你很好，哥们
You're all right, man. You're good, man.

534
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:48,608
咚，咚，
Knock, knock.

535
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:54,650
带上所有东西，即使是一个老掉牙的掌上游戏机。听懂了吗
Take everything. I don't care if it's an old school Game Boy. You get it.

536
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:04,442
真的，哥们？
Really, bruv?

537
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:37,817
有四个小伙子闯了进来
There were four lads who pushed their way in.

538
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,733
他们看起来很吓人。他们身材高大，像这样。
They looked threatening. They were tall, like that.

539
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:44,942
他们都穿着黑色衣服，带着兜帽...
All in black, you know, hoods up and stuff and...

540
00:51:46,442 --> 00:51:48,650
他们搜走了所有的电气。
They was asking for everything electric.

541
00:51:49,942 --> 00:51:53,025
他们拿走了我的电话，拿走了我的笔记本电脑。
They took my phone, took my laptop.

542
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:56,192
他们拿走了该死的电视和所有的东西。
They took the bloody TV and all.

543
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:57,317
走进我孙子的...
Went into my grandson's...

544
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,817
我的意思是，我从来没见过那家伙...
<i>I mean, I-I've never met the guy...</i>

545
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:16,442
...就像我们上周谈论过的，我们说过...
<i>...like we were talking about last week, we were saying...</i>

546
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:19,125
- 你找到他了？  - 要么是我们把他吓跑了。
<i>- You found him?  - Either that or we scared him off.</i>

547
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:21,900
这几天我啥都没听到，所以我认为一切都结束了，老板。
<i>I ain't heard nothing for days, so I reckon it's over, boss.</i>

548
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,824
好吧，我会重新开始交易。
<i>All right, I'll get a new delivery in.</i>

549
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:26,192
今晚到货场来取货。
<i>Go to the yard tonight to pick it up.</i>

550
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:29,025
- 我们承担不起任何麻烦了。  - 交给我吧，老板。
<i>- We can't afford any more trouble.  - Leave it to me, boss.</i>

551
00:52:29,108 --> 00:52:31,400
逮到你了。
Got ya.

552
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,067
告诉我你到底要去哪里之前，你哪儿也不能去。
You're not leaving until you tell me exactly where you're going.

553
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,067
我不再是孩子了，我不需要什么都告诉你。
I'm not a kid anymore. I don't have to tell you everything.

554
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,358
你知道吧，当我看着你的时候就象看到了你妈妈。
You know, I see your mom in you when I look at you.

555
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:05,275
- 她是个瘾君子。  - 她是你妈妈。
- She was a junkie.  - She was your mother.

556
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:07,067
并且她是我的女儿。
And she was my daughter.

557
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:12,025
她犯了错误，但她很善良。
She made mistakes, but she was kind.

558
00:53:12,108 --> 00:53:15,317
她是个好人，她爱你。
And she was good. She loved you.

559
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,275
她不知道如何应付，我应该替她去那里。
She didn't know how to cope, and I should have been there for her.

560
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:25,067
所以我要对你说我希望对她说的那些话。
So, I will say to you what I wished I had said to her.

561
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,067
我爱你。
I love you.

562
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:32,192
回家。
Come home.

563
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:36,483
别等我。
Don't wait up.

564
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:43,567
剑
Yay!

565
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:52,067
你好啊,亲爱的？找活儿干吗?
You all right, sweetheart? Looking for some business?

566
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,858
我有十元纸币。可以做一点烂事儿。
I got a tenner somewhere. Could do with a little sucky-suck.

567
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:58,858
你为什么不把这十元纸币塞进自己屁股里，亲爱的?
Why don't you take that tenner and shove it up your ass, my darling?

568
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:01,817
我认识你爷爷，当年我们一直叫他“铅笔”。
I knew your granddad back in the day. We used to call him "The Pencil."

569
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,358
懂我的意思吗？
Know what I mean?

570
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:04,442
闭嘴。
Shut up, man.

571
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,067
- 哈维女士。  - 丹尼，能和你说句话吗？
- Ms. Harvey.  - Yeah, Danny, can I have a word?

572
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:12,442
告诉我，你有没有注意到最近汤姆的行为有些奇怪？
Tell me, have you noticed Tom behaving oddly recently?

573
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:15,442
他一直就很奇怪，但...
He's always been odd, but...

574
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:17,942
那次事故之后他确实不太一样了。
Yeah, he's been different since the accident.

575
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:21,775
- 那不是一次事故。  - 是的，我也认为那不是一次事故。
- It wasn't an accident.  - No, I suppose not.

576
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:24,733
但是，他变了，他...
But, yeah, he has changed. He...

577
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,733
他很狂躁，并且我...我不知道他要做什么。
He's angry, and I... I don't know what he's gonna do.

578
00:54:31,525 --> 00:54:33,775
但我知道我不想让他再受伤了
But I do know I don't want him to get hurt anymore,

579
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:35,817
所以你会对他多留心吗，丹尼?
so will you look out for him, Danny?

580
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,983
是的，是的。当然，我会的，哈维女士。我一定会这样做。
Yeah, yeah. Of course, I will, Ms. Harvey. I'll definitely do that.

581
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,608
你是个好孩子，谢谢。
You're a good boy. Thanks.

582
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
iBOY：我要解决这一切

583
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
露西：我要你停手

584
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
iBOY：我做这个是为了你

585
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
露西：不，你做这个是为了你

586
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
距离卡滋手机439米...438米...437米...436米...

587
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
距离卡滋手机262米...261米...260米...259米...

588
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:13,108
靠
Shit.

589
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:46,525
A12黑墙隧道和...之间的事故留下很多...
<i>The accident there that's left much of the A12 between Blackwall Tunnel and...</i>

590
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:33,608
把你体重产生的力量贯穿在整个击打过程中。
<i>Use your weight to build power and follow through the strike.</i>

591
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:35,572
- 用你的左侧。  - 和手腕平行。
<i>- Use your left here.  - Parallel with the wrist.</i>

592
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:39,817
打击你对手的胸部。
<i>Hit your opponent in the chest.</i>

593
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,525
然后找到对手的弱点...
<i>Then find your opponent's weak spot...</i>

594
00:58:56,483 --> 00:58:58,275
贯穿在整个击打过程中
<i>Follow through the strike.</i>

595
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
埃尔曼，这一切不会停止，除非你离开

596
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:36,608
干他
Get on him.

597
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,430
- 直到他死了！  - 整死他！
- Till he's dead!  - Step him out!

598
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,483
把这狗屎整死！
Knock this shit out!

599
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:08,942
起初一切都很完美，直到我怀孕了。
<i>"At first, everything was perfect until I fell pregnant."</i>

600
01:01:09,025 --> 01:01:11,900
告诉我，亲爱的，因为我为你感到可惜。
<i>Tell me more, sweetheart, because you're the one I feel sorry for.</i>

601
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:13,608
当我和我女儿怀孕的时候
<i>Well, when I got pregnant with my daughter,</i>

602
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:15,233
一切开始变得沮丧。
<i>everything started to get depressing.</i>

603
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:16,917
一开始很难。然后它开始...
<i>It was hard at first. Then it started...</i>

604
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:52,067
露西
Lucy.

605
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:55,733
你能出现真是太好了，汤姆
Nice of you to show up, Tom.

606
01:01:57,692 --> 01:02:01,192
- 我知道。我...对不起，我当时没在那里。  - 不，听着。
- I know. I'm... I'm sorry I wasn't there.  - No, listen.

607
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:04,358
你说过你会和我在一起，你说过。
You said you would come with me. You said that.

608
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:06,233
- 我知道，对不起。  - 算了吧。
- I know. I'm sorry.  - Forget it.

609
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:08,858
我很抱歉。我一直在忙。
Look, I'm sorry. I've been busy.

610
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,983
- 我向你保证，我会补偿给你。  - 忙？
- I promise you, I'll make it up to you.  - Busy?

611
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:13,150
我希望我可以解释，但事情已经...
I wish I could explain, but things have been...

612
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:16,067
- 我有点反常。  - 不，说真的，汤姆，忘了它吧。
- I haven't been myself.  - No, seriously, Tom, just forget it.

613
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:52,025
卡斯
Cass, man.

614
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:55,400
烧成灰我都认识他。
I've known him since forever.

615
01:02:57,525 --> 01:02:59,067
他是一个白痴，但是...
He was a dickhead, but...

616
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:01,858
是的
Yeah.

617
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:05,650
你出什么事了？
So, what happened to you?

618
01:03:07,525 --> 01:03:10,192
哦，只是...被欺负了，仅此而已。
Oh, just... got jumped, that's all.

619
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:13,317
最近我都没看到你。
I haven't seen you around lately.

620
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:17,442
复习
Been revising.

621
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:20,400
我听到的可不是这样。
It's not what I've heard.

622
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:22,817
我表弟蒂亚说你没参加考试。
My cousin Tia says you haven't been in exams.

623
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:26,067
这是耻辱，哥们
It's a shame, man.

624
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:29,317
我一直认为你是能去那种地方的人。
I always thought you'd be the one to go places.

625
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,608
谁杀了卡斯，丹尼？
Who killed Cass, Danny?

626
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:37,567
如果你问我...
If you ask me...

627
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,233
我认为是那个黑客。
I blame that hacker.

628
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,108
他挑起的这个烂事只有一种方法结束。
He started shit that could only end one way.

629
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:51,942
- 再见，汤姆。  - 再见。
- See you around, Tom.  - See you around.

630
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,858
- 你听说那个卡斯的事了吗？  - 那个卡斯...
<i>- Did you hear about that Cass guy?  - That Cass guy...</i>

631
01:04:03,067 --> 01:04:05,608
你怎么认为？是iBOY杀了他？或者你认为...
<i>What do you think? It's iBOY that killed him? Or do you think...</i>

632
01:04:07,067 --> 01:04:10,317
我们把他放下来。把他从阳台上...
<i>Let's cut him down. Take him from the balcony...</i>

633
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,942
每个人都在谈论iBOY。
<i>Everyone's saying it's iBOY.</i>

634
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,817
你为什么不和我说说你到底怎么了？
Why don't you tell me a little bit about what's going on with you?

635
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:24,358
只是...我脑袋里很痛...我只是...我需要...
It's just... this pain in my head... I just... I need the pieces...

636
01:04:24,442 --> 01:04:26,483
你必须找到某种方式...我只是...
You've gotta find some way... I just...

637
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,858
- 你需要去做手术。  - 嗯，听着...
- You need to operate.  - Well, look...

638
01:04:28,942 --> 01:04:30,275
只是TMD把那个东西从我脑袋里取出来！
Just take the pieces out of my fucking brain!

639
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:32,150
嘿，嘿。好吧，好吧。
Hey, hey. Okay, okay.

640
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:34,650
对此我们无能为力。
There's not a lot that we can do about it.

641
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:37,817
这些碎片已经深入你的大脑组织。
These fragments have moved a lot deeper into your brain tissue.

642
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,567
- 我们没有安全的方法可以...  - 如果我付你钱呢？
- There's just no safe way that we can...  - What if I pay you?

643
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,442
嗯，那我得是在私人诊所，
Well, then I'd be in private practice,

644
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:44,650
但我恐怕仍将不得不说“不”。
but I'm afraid I would still have to say no.

645
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:46,525
你一定要帮忙。
You've got to help.

646
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:48,817
这事已经和刚开始的时候不一样了。
Things haven't been the same since it's happened.

647
01:04:51,108 --> 01:04:53,400
听着...
Look...

648
01:04:53,483 --> 01:04:57,150
也许，我不是你需要交谈的那种医生。
Perhaps, I'm not the kind of doctor that you need to be talking to.

649
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:53,025
你需要一些牛奶。
You're gonna need some more milk.

650
01:05:59,608 --> 01:06:00,608
你好，温迪。
Hello, Wendy.

651
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,483
我刚刚读了一些你的故事。
I've just been reading some of your stories.

652
01:06:04,567 --> 01:06:06,567
你是一匹黑马,不是吗?
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

653
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:09,317
埃尔曼，你TMD在这干啥呢？
Ellman, what the fuck are you doing here?

654
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,817
这么多年了，我们就不能变文明点？
After all these years, can't we at least be civil?

655
01:06:12,608 --> 01:06:14,650
你扔下我们不管，你他妈的混蛋！
You leave us alone, you fucking bastard!

656
01:06:15,192 --> 01:06:16,942
- 奶奶！  - 卡滋。
- Nan!  - Cutz.

657
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:18,983
真的吗？你奶奶？
Really? The granny?

658
01:06:21,108 --> 01:06:23,942
把她放在床上。确保她在呼吸。
Put her on the bed. Make sure she's breathing.

659
01:06:24,025 --> 01:06:26,192
- 让我看看她。  - 别担心，她会没事的。
- Let me see her.  - Don't worry, she'll be all right.

660
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:27,567
我们会留意她。
We'll keep an eye on her.

661
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:31,317
卡滋就象是一个在中国拿着锤子的人。明白我的意思吗？
Cutz is a man with a hammer in a world of china. Know what I mean?

662
01:06:32,483 --> 01:06:34,192
科恩，放开他。
Keon, let him go.

663
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:40,233
你会希望自己从没做过那件事。
You're gonna wish you hadn't done that.

664
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:43,567
噢，是吗？你要他妈的做什么，你个小杂种？
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna fucking do, you little prick?

665
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:44,983
卡滋，够了。
Cutz, enough.

666
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,192
我在这座大楼里长大。
I grew up in this tower block.

667
01:06:55,775 --> 01:06:58,025
我卧室的朝向同这间一样。
My bedroom looked out the same side as this.

668
01:06:58,108 --> 01:06:59,817
- 风景不太一样了。  - 你想干什么？
- View's changed a bit.  - What do you want?

669
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:02,858
不停的回忆，可以吗？
To reminisce uninterrupted. Is that okay?

670
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,108
你看，想当年，当我还穿着短裤的时候，
You see, back in the day, when I was in short trousers,

671
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:07,692
整个这片地方就是一个屎坑。
this whole area was a shit-hole.

672
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:11,400
现在，这只是我们……在百万富翁的阴影下。
Now, it's just us... in the shadow of millionaires.

673
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:13,817
你认为有多少来自这个住宅区的人
How many lads from the estate

674
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,733
才建成了那些摩天大楼，汤姆?
do you think make it up those skyscrapers, Tom?

675
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:19,108
我们有不同的目标要实现，不是吗?
We have different towers to climb, don't we?

676
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:22,150
所以...
So...

677
01:07:24,192 --> 01:07:27,983
你找我，我来了，你想对我说什么？
You called. Here I am. What did you want to say to me?

678
01:07:30,192 --> 01:07:34,192
没有？我们脑海中的那些时刻总是更美好，不是吗？
No? These moments are always better in our head, aren't they?

679
01:07:34,275 --> 01:07:36,608
法语里有个词形容它。
The French have a word for it.

680
01:07:36,692 --> 01:07:39,317
但是后来他们有一个词来形容TMD一切。
But then they have a word for fucking everything.

681
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,317
- 我想要伤害你。  - 好啊。
- I wanted to hurt you.  - Okay, good.

682
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,400
- 现在，我们去某个地方。  - 再也不会了。
- Now, we're getting somewhere.  - Not anymore.

683
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:51,108
- 你不值得。现在一切都结束了。  - 离结束还远着呢，汤姆。
- You're not worth it. It's over now.  - It's pretty far from over, Tom.

684
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:55,608
不要召唤魔鬼，当他出现的时候你会感到不安的。
You don't call the devil then get upset when he turns up.

685
01:07:55,692 --> 01:07:57,608
你不是魔鬼。你就是一傻B。
You're not the devil. You're just a cunt.

686
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,400
我想我有点，是的。
I suppose I am a bit, yeah.

687
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
那是什么？
What was that?

688
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,525
你这是干啥呢？
What is it you're doing?

689
01:08:09,233 --> 01:08:12,567
你的眼神告诉我你好象很忙。
You've got a little look in your eye like you're busy.

690
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,358
是不，汤姆？
Are you, Tom?

691
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,150
你是勤劳的小蜜蜂？
Are you busy little bee?

692
01:08:18,983 --> 01:08:20,358
你在找什么？
What you looking for?

693
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:24,358
你知道吗？
Do you know?

694
01:08:24,442 --> 01:08:29,858
我听到传言说你能用你的意念接入电话。
I've heard rumors that you can tap into phones with just your mind.

695
01:08:29,942 --> 01:08:33,317
动动手指就能进入银行账户。
Break into bank accounts with the click of a finger.

696
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:37,442
- 听起来有点难以置信，不是吗?  - 是的。
- Sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it?  - Yeah.

697
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:39,692
但你知道...
But do you know...

698
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:41,150
我碰巧想到...
I happen to think...

699
01:08:43,983 --> 01:08:44,983
这是真的吗？
that it's true?

700
01:08:47,192 --> 01:08:48,817
我什么都不知道。
I wouldn't know anything about that.

701
01:08:50,483 --> 01:08:51,983
别那样做。
Don't do that.

702
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:54,275
这是我们和他们之间的区别。
That's the difference between us and them.

703
01:08:55,692 --> 01:08:58,442
他们有一点点天赋就站在屋顶大喊大叫。
They have a modicum of talent, they shout it from the rooftops.

704
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,942
可是我们呢？我们有一个天才，但确秘而不宣。
Us? We have a talent, we get told to shut up.

705
01:09:01,025 --> 01:09:03,525
别炫耀。别做一个聪明的混蛋。
"Don't show off. Don't be such a clever bastard."

706
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:08,692
你很特别，汤姆。永远不要假装你不是。
You're special, Tom. Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.

707
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:11,775
好吧，我与众不同。
All right, I'm special.

708
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,233
和你又有什么关系？
What's it got to do with you?

709
01:09:19,025 --> 01:09:23,317
我的一个天赋，如果我可以大胆猜测的话，那就是洞察力。
My one gift, if I may be so bold, is vision.

710
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,025
我想帮你发挥你的潜力。
I want to help you fulfill your potential.

711
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:30,067
我想给你一个改变世界的机会。
I want to give you the opportunity to change the world.

712
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:33,192
你的意思是有机会赚很多钱。
You mean the opportunity to make a lot of money.

713
01:09:33,275 --> 01:09:36,942
- 一大笔钱。  - 还是算了吧。
- An obscene amount of money.  - I'll pass.

714
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:40,400
- 为什么？  - 因为去你妈的，这就是为什么。
- Why?  - 'Cause go fuck yourself, that's why.

715
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:42,692
嘿，嘿，嘿。
Hey, hey, hey.

716
01:09:45,233 --> 01:09:46,650
好吧。
Okay.

717
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:51,150
好吧。嗯...
Okay. Well...

718
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:54,608
这值得一试。
It was worth a shot.

719
01:09:59,858 --> 01:10:02,692
为了把我的小子们从警方拘留所捞出来我花了很多钱
I've spent a lot of money bailing my boys out of police custody,

720
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:04,442
所以你欠我。
so you owe me.

721
01:10:04,525 --> 01:10:07,858
现在，我要你问自己一个非常重要的问题。
Now, I want you to ask yourself one very important question.

722
01:10:08,942 --> 01:10:13,900
哦，露西在哪里？
"Where, oh, where is Lucy?"

723
01:10:21,275 --> 01:10:22,900
你看到她了吗？
You see her, don't you?

724
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:26,442
她和这事一点关系都没有。
She's got nothing to do with any of this.

725
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,233
这完全取决于你。
That's entirely up to you.

726
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:38,983
我不喜欢这样。
I don't like this.

727
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:41,608
下次，从你TMD妈妈那要个许可之类的。
Next time, get a note from your fucking mom or something.

728
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:44,108
- 我不能杀女孩。  - 不会走到那一步的。
- I can't kill no girl.  - It ain't gonna come to that!

729
01:10:44,192 --> 01:10:46,317
- 如果真走到那一步了呢？  - 我已经在这了。
- Yeah, what if it does?  - I'm right here, you know.

730
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,483
是的，我们看到你了。
Yeah, we see you.

731
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:51,733
什么，就像从托儿所开始你TM每天看到我那样吗?
What, just like you've seen me every fucking day since nursery?

732
01:10:51,817 --> 01:10:53,733
这是否意味着什么？
Does that mean nothing?

733
01:10:57,358 --> 01:10:58,692
来吧，安特。
Come on, Ant.

734
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,650
我们一起长大。
We grew up together.

735
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:04,108
我们的妈妈过去经常带我们一起放学回家。
Our moms used to walk us home from school together.

736
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:06,152
我们过去经常在住宅区旁边的小公园里玩吗？
We used to play in that little park by the estate?

737
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:09,150
- 他妈的！  - 嗨，塞住她的嘴，哈泽德。
- Fuck this, man!  - Oi, gag her or something, Haz.

738
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:11,275
他妈的我不能再听她说了。
I can't listen to her shit anymore, man.

739
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,442
- 那么，它是如何工作的？  - 他们开枪打我之后我醒来就有这个能力了。
- So, how does it work, then?  - I woke up with it after they shot me.

740
01:11:27,608 --> 01:11:30,192
- 你被射中然后就有了超能力。  - 是的。
- You get shot and you get super powers.  - Yes.

741
01:11:30,275 --> 01:11:33,150
- 大多数人会死掉。  - 我猜是幸运。
- Most people just get dead.  - Lucky, I guess.

742
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:35,400
这个还有待被证实。
That's yet to be established.

743
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:40,817
- 所以继续，让我看看你能做什么。  - 我不会为你偷东西。
- So go on. Show me what you can do.  - I won't steal for you.

744
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,650
不过，我认为你可能会的。
I think you probably might, though.

745
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:50,817
你按我说的做，不然我会毁掉你的世界。
You're gonna do what I say, or I'm gonna burn your world down.

746
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:54,233
丹尼，你能来这里吗？
Danny, can you come in here, please?

747
01:11:56,317 --> 01:11:58,442
这是丹尼尔，他第一个和我说
It was young Daniel here who first suggested

748
01:11:58,525 --> 01:12:00,442
你可能就是我们的蒙面人
you might be our masked man.

749
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,983
你知道吗？他甚至不想在这亲眼见证他说的有多正确。
And do you know? He didn't even want to be here to see if he was right.

750
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:08,108
- 你认识丹尼有多久了？  - 从出生就认识。
- How long have you known Danny?  - My whole life.

751
01:12:08,192 --> 01:12:09,733
从出生就认识。
Your whole life.

752
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:14,983
我从来没见过这个人，然而，他把你给了我。
I've never even met the guy and yet, he gave you up to me.

753
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:18,233
知道为什么吗？
Do you know why?

754
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:23,900
女王的小照片（英磅上有女王的头像）
Little pictures of the Queen.

755
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:30,067
当你要出卖朋友的时候，看着他的眼睛。
If you're gonna betray a friend, look him in the eye while you do it.

756
01:12:32,442 --> 01:12:33,858
伊丽莎白的小照片。
Little pictures of Elizabeth.

757
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,025
张开嘴，丹尼。
Open your mouth, Danny.

758
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,275
张开你TMD嘴。
Open your fucking mouth.

759
01:12:53,108 --> 01:12:55,817
如果你还想知道更多的话，这就是权力的样子。
In case you're wondering, that's what power looks like.

760
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,067
现在...
Now...

761
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,400
你要把资金放进我的银行账户…
You're gonna put funds into my bank account...

762
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:03,442
因为我知道你能做到，
because I know you can do it,

763
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:06,686
而且我知道你不想让我做那些你不听话我就会去做的事情。
and I know you're not gonna let me do the things I'm willing to do if you don't.

764
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:08,940
把你的电话给我，丹尼。
Give me your phone, Danny.

765
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,108
现在，滚出去。
Now, fuck off.

766
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:19,608
好了，我们都不再年轻了，让我们把这事搞掂吧。
Okay, none of us are getting any younger. Let's get this done.

767
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:25,150
乖乖的把她填好，好吗？
Be a dear and fill her up, will you?

768
01:13:35,025 --> 01:13:36,692
这是你正常的速度吗？
Is that as fast as you can go?

769
01:13:39,108 --> 01:13:41,608
我可以把整个英格兰银行都转过来，但是...
I could just dump the entire Bank of England in there, but...

770
01:13:41,692 --> 01:13:43,942
我认为人们会开始产生疑问。
I think people might start asking questions.

771
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:48,150
你看，尽管如此我还是喜欢这家伙。
You see, I still like this guy despite everything.

772
01:13:50,358 --> 01:13:52,233
你是个特别的孩子，汤姆。
You're a special kid, Tom.

773
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,067
一个特别的孩子。
A special kid.

774
01:13:58,275 --> 01:13:59,525
看来我们正在这么做。
Looks like we're doing it.

775
01:14:00,858 --> 01:14:02,067
我要在这颗子弹上面刻个X。
I'm gonna put an X on it.

776
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:03,983
是吗？
Yeah?

777
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:08,108
不管谁得到X谁就去做。把你的手伸出来。
Whoever gets the X has got to do it. Put your hands out.

778
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:10,442
你他妈的在跟我开玩笑吗？
Are you fucking kidding me?

779
01:14:10,525 --> 01:14:12,246
- 你想怎样...？  - 别和她说话。
- What'd you expect...?  - Don't talk to her.

780
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:15,817
我不会向一个手无寸铁绑在椅子上的女孩开枪。
Well, I wouldn't shoot an unarmed girl tied to a chair.

781
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,900
闭嘴。
Shut up.

782
01:14:16,983 --> 01:14:19,192
但是我猜我不像你一样是个大男人，尤金。
But I guess I'm not a big man like you, Eugene.

783
01:14:19,275 --> 01:14:21,400
闭嘴！闭上TMD嘴！
Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!

784
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:25,150
为什么你他妈的不亲自来做这件事？那不是你想要的吗？
Why don't you just fucking do it, then? Isn't that what you want?

785
01:14:26,025 --> 01:14:28,317
- 嘿，冷静，哥们。行了，哥们。  - 别考验我的神精！
- Hey, yo, calm down, man. Come on, man.  - Don't test me, man!

786
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,067
- 冷静，哥们！冷静！  - 从我身边滚开！
- Chill, mate! Chill, man!  - Get the fuck off me!

787
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,483
- 救命！  - 快点！
- Help!  - Hurry up!

788
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:38,358
闭嘴。
Shut up.

789
01:14:38,442 --> 01:14:41,150
- 我们TMD得走了，哥们！  - 赶紧，哥们！
- We gotta fucking go, man!  - Hurry up, man!

790
01:14:45,775 --> 01:14:47,108
刚才发生了什么？
What just happened?

791
01:14:48,483 --> 01:14:49,483
没什么。
Nothing.

792
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,150
卡滋，检查检查仓库。
Cutz, check in with the warehouse.

793
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:08,608
把它关了。
Turn it off.

794
01:15:10,608 --> 01:15:11,608
靠。
Fuck.

795
01:15:13,858 --> 01:15:15,400
没有应答，老板。
No answer, boss.

796
01:15:18,942 --> 01:15:21,775
好吧，我们把这个带上。
All right, let's take this on the road.

797
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:33,233
他们走了。嗨，他们走了。
They're gone. Oi, they're gone.

798
01:15:33,317 --> 01:15:35,817
刚才太TM悬了，哥们。
That was fucking close, bruv.

799
01:15:40,358 --> 01:15:43,525
嗨，混蛋。你们TMD搞砸了。
Oh, shit. You fucked up.

800
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,983
汤姆...克罗利住宅区哈珀斯。
Tom... of the Crowley Estate Harpers.

801
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:15,775
我认识你妈妈，当年她是一个正值青春年华的女孩。
I knew your mum back in the day. She was a good time girl.

802
01:16:15,858 --> 01:16:17,942
她可以用她的手上功夫点亮一个房间。
She could light up a room with her hand jobs.

803
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:22,817
她死的时候你好象是3岁？
You must have been, what, three when she died?

804
01:16:23,858 --> 01:16:26,067
- 2岁。  - 2岁？
- Two.  - Two?

805
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,983
你知道吗我很了解她。
I knew her well, you know.

806
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,567
非常了解。
Very well.

807
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:36,192
天啊，你不觉得...
Gosh, you don't think...

808
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:43,150
我们好象都很容易惹一大堆麻烦，不是吗？
We both certainly like getting into a lot of trouble, don't we?

809
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:56,192
我不是真的要杀你，露西。
I wasn't actually gonna kill you, Luce.

810
01:16:57,192 --> 01:16:58,900
- 不？  - 不，不，不，不。
- No?  - No, no, no, no, no.

811
01:17:00,692 --> 01:17:01,692
冷静。
Calm down.

812
01:17:02,442 --> 01:17:07,192
我也从来没想过你会强奸我...尤金。
I never used to think you could rape me... either, Eugene.

813
01:17:08,525 --> 01:17:10,650
因为我们是一起长大的。
'Cause we grew up together.

814
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:14,108
而且我们曾经是朋友，记得吗？
And we were friends, remember?

815
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:18,025
- 事情搞砸了，我承认...  - 你不许谈这件事！
- What happened was fucked up, I admit...  - You don't get to talk about it!

816
01:17:18,108 --> 01:17:20,150
干你，安特！
Fuck you, Ant!

817
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:22,317
干你们所有人！
Fuck all of you!

818
01:17:26,233 --> 01:17:27,442
告诉我你们感到羞愧。
Tell me you're ashamed.

819
01:17:27,525 --> 01:17:28,858
- 我很羞愧。  - 老实说，我很羞愧。
- I'm ashamed.  - Honestly, I'm ashamed.

820
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:31,900
- 我很羞愧。我发誓我很羞愧。  - 不！
- I'm ashamed. I swear that I'm ashamed.  - No!

821
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,525
你害怕了！
You're scared!

822
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:42,650
如果你真的感到羞愧，你就不能这样看着我。
If you were ashamed, you wouldn't be able to even look at me.

823
01:17:44,942 --> 01:17:47,817
所以，别TMD看着我！
So, don't fucking look at me!

824
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:54,025
你们都跪下
Get on your knees, all of you.

825
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:55,442
- 露西，露西...  - 马上！
- Lucy, Lucy...  - Now!

826
01:17:55,525 --> 01:17:58,233
- 露西，请不要这样。  - 对不起，对不起。
- Lucy, you don't have to do this, please.  - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

827
01:18:02,108 --> 01:18:04,358
我不知道你们发生了什么事。
I don't know what happened to you.

828
01:18:19,442 --> 01:18:20,442
哇...
Well...

829
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:25,067
我必须承认 我希望你能更克制
I have to admit I was expecting you to be rather more restrained than this,

830
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,192
年轻女士。
young lady.

831
01:18:27,067 --> 01:18:28,067
好极了。
Bravo.

832
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:31,983
小子们，你们能来这里吗？
Boys, can you come out here, please?

833
01:18:36,025 --> 01:18:37,483
你还没射他们呢，是吗?
You haven't shot them, have you?

834
01:18:39,525 --> 01:18:40,525
噢，好。
Oh, good.

835
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:46,317
先生们，一切都在掌握之中吗？只是，人质有枪。
Gentlemen, everything under control? Only, the hostage has got the gun.

836
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,983
露西！
Lucy!

837
01:18:51,067 --> 01:18:52,567
别TM动。
Don't fucking move.

838
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,900
汤姆？
Tom?

839
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:57,233
自然秩序恢复了。
Natural order is restored.

840
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:00,650
来吧，汤姆，你得到了。
Come on, Tom, up you get.

841
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,775
顺便说一下，我想亲自
By the way, I wanted to apologize personally

842
01:19:03,858 --> 01:19:06,150
向你承受的遭遇道歉。
for the indignities you had to suffer.

843
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:07,525
现在的年轻人...
Young people today...

844
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,900
像动物一样，你知道吗？
Like animals, you know?

845
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,733
我也不喜欢我自己。
I wouldn't like me, either.

846
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,900
继续。
Continue.

847
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:30,108
快点，汤姆。
Come on, Tom.

848
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:32,358
我正在尽力。
I'm trying.

849
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:37,900
有点怯场了？
A bit of performance anxiety?

850
01:19:46,817 --> 01:19:47,983
汤姆？
Tom?

851
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:50,567
快点！
Come on!

852
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,858
如果我给你机会让你离开，你会接受吗？
If I gave you the option to walk away, would you take it?

853
01:20:00,942 --> 01:20:02,108
什么？
What?

854
01:20:02,192 --> 01:20:06,775
如果我给你机会让你离开 并且永远也不要回来，你会接受吗？
If I gave you the option to walk away and never come back, would you take it?

855
01:20:08,442 --> 01:20:10,025
我TMD为什么要接受？
Why the fuck would I do that?

856
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,733
我就是想先问一下。
Just thought I'd ask first.

857
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,858
在我生命中再没有人更TMD让我感到失望了。
I've never been more fucking disappointed with anyone in my life.

858
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,358
也许你并不特别。
Maybe you're not that special after all.

859
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:34,775
是的，你是与众不同...
No, you are special...

860
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:38,567
但我还是要杀了你！
But I'm still gonna kill ya!

861
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:45,358
离他远点，你个中年白痴！
Get the fuck away from him, you middle-aged prick!

862
01:22:03,567 --> 01:22:04,775
愚蠢的小姑娘。
Stupid little girl.

863
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:36,275
一切都恢复原状了，奶奶？
Back again, Nan?

864
01:23:36,358 --> 01:23:39,025
噢，小汤姆。
Oh, Tommy.

865
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:19,817
汤姆。
Tom.

866
01:24:23,317 --> 01:24:24,317
你想怎样？
What do you want?

867
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,650
这是埃尔曼给我的钱。
Here's the money Ellman gave me.

868
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,275
我知道我做过的事是不可原谅的。
What I did was unforgivable. I know that.

869
01:24:35,358 --> 01:24:38,775
我知道我们之间已经完了。我只是想做对你有益的事。
I know we're done. I just wanted to do right by you.

870
01:24:38,858 --> 01:24:41,483
为什么？因为我们是朋友？
Why? 'Cause we were friends?

871
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:43,817
或者是因为你害怕我？
Or 'cause you're scared of me?

872
01:24:46,567 --> 01:24:47,567
你自己留着吧，我不想要。
Keep it. I don't want it.

873
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:52,733
你知道吗，我认为你帮了我们所有人一个忙，
I reckon you did us all a favor, you know, taking him out.

874
01:24:53,983 --> 01:24:56,983
我只是说，我知道这可能让你感到内疚，
I'm just saying, I know you're probably beating yourself up about it,

875
01:24:57,067 --> 01:25:01,108
但是，像他们这样的人不得不这么做。
but, guys like that, they gotta get got.

876
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:07,858
知道吗，丹尼，我想我在视频里找到了每个人，
You know, Danny, I was thinking, I went after everyone in that video,

877
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:10,733
但我一直在想谁是那个拍摄的人。
but I didn't stop to think about who was filming.

878
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:16,317
也许你能找出他是谁。
Maybe you'll get him yet.

879
01:25:18,317 --> 01:25:19,525
平静，汤姆。
Peace, Tom.

880
01:25:22,567 --> 01:25:23,567
嘿。
Yo.

881
01:25:24,775 --> 01:25:25,900
给你。
Give it to you down there.

882
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:35,067
别跳。
Don't jump.

883
01:25:37,817 --> 01:25:39,650
除非你现在能飞了。
Unless you can fly now, too.

884
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:41,442
那是你的另一个魔力吗？
Is that another one of your magical powers?

885
01:25:44,192 --> 01:25:48,733
- 所以，回想起来事情相当疯狂。  - 大家受到了伤害，汤姆。
- So, things got pretty mental back there.  - People got hurt, Tom.

886
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:51,775
我知道。
I know.

887
01:25:51,858 --> 01:25:55,317
- 我的意思是，我确实给了那家伙一枪。  - 对不起，露西。
- I mean, I literally shot a guy.  - I'm sorry, Lucy.

888
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,025
我想说我很抱歉。
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

889
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,442
好吧。
All right.

890
01:26:00,525 --> 01:26:01,692
我原谅你。
I forgive you.

891
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:06,275
只要闭上眼睛我就会看到他的脸。
I see his face whenever I close my eyes.

892
01:26:06,358 --> 01:26:11,733
只要闭上眼睛我就会看到很多人的脸。我不知道这会不会真的烟消云散。
I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes. I don't know if it ever really goes away.

893
01:26:13,817 --> 01:26:16,317
但如果你帮我 我就会帮你。
But I'll help you if you help me.

894
01:26:23,275 --> 01:26:28,150
知道吗，城里有些餐馆。
You know, there are restaurants in town.

895
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:31,692
人们走进去然后有人给他们做饭。那真的很棒。
People go and then other people cook for them. It's really great.

896
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:33,775
你应该去试试。
You should try it.

897
01:26:35,192 --> 01:26:36,432
但这里风景相当好。
The view's pretty good, though.

898
01:26:41,858 --> 01:26:43,983
所以，你还要继续傻站在这吗？
