Oh, I'm sorry.
Should we start talking to you now?

Stand over there, fam.

He's cool. Listen.
All right, Cutz. He's cool.

- Are you sure?

00:25:58,358 --> 00:25:59,775
Yeah, yeah. He's cool, he's cool.

So, for this morning's thought of the day,

we will be discussing with you
future planning.

Now, as you know, many of the top here
will be, uh, taking their exams soon.

It's always at this time of year,

to some of you,

Boys, stay calm! Just sit down!

Sit! I said sit down!

<i>Look, if you can pay the 600 now,</i>

422
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,817
<i>then we can stop the added interest
on the account,</i>

- Wait, hold on.</i>

The account's coming up as cleared.</i>

Right.

I don't reckon
I could live on a canal boat.

434
00:34:03,233 --> 00:34:06,358
- Why not?
- It's too low down.

435
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:09,733
I really like being able to see
all of the city and the little people

It's actually really nice

My mum just watches me constantly.

It's like she thinks I'm gonna throw
myself off the balcony or something.

445
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,733
I've never been the victim.

446
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,775
It doesn't feel right.

447
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:50,317
- I don't see you like that.
- Yeah, you do.

448
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:53,608
But it's all right.

449
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,108
You'll get there.

450
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:03,900
You know, out of everyone,

451
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:08,275
you're the only person
who has come to see me.

452
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,025
- Luce, what happened?
- Tom...

453
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,692
No, I... I just...

454
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,317
I want you to know you can...

455
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:23,692
I want you to feel safe when I'm around.

456
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:24,775
What I mean is,

457
00:35:24,858 --> 00:35:27,733
if we were in trouble again, I want you
to know that I wouldn't run this time.

458
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:29,108
I'd stay.

459
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:31,483
Even if it meant I'd die, I'd just...

460
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,942
I just want you to know that.

461
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:41,192
Okay.

462
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,692
Same.

463
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:50,150
Did I ever tell you
about when I got locked out

464
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,317
on your roof overnight
with, uh, what's-her-face?

465
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,692
- No.
- Alice.

466
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,192
Do you know Alice?
She sat, like, left of you in...

467
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:57,650
- ...math?
- I think so.

468
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:00,358

- Yeah, man. What you saying?

00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,817
Nothing, man, I just wanted
to ask you a little question.

630
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,275
You see, if someone put a gun
to your fucking face like this here, huh?

00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:50,567
And said, "Give me names,"

632
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,942
would you do it?

633
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,192
No?

634
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,817
Or if it was a car and it was burning?

635
00:50:00,192 --> 00:50:02,192
Would you do that?
Would you drop my name?

636
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,108
- What about Ellman?
- Of course not.

And nothing happened to you.

- You're confused?

It's cool, man. Do your thing.

There were four lads
who pushed their way in.

00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,233
They looked threatening.
They were tall, like that.

All in black, you know,
hoods up and stuff and...

They was asking for everything electric.

They took my phone, took my laptop.

- She was your mother.

And she was my daughter.

And she was good. She loved you.

Looking for some business?

I got a tenner somewhere.
Could do with a little sucky-suck.

- Yeah, Danny, can I have a word?

Tell me, have you noticed
Tom behaving oddly recently?

[chuckles]
He's always been odd, but...

689
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:15,442
Yeah, he's been different
since the accident.

690
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:19,275
- It wasn't an accident.
- No, I suppose not.

691
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:22,233
But, yeah, he has changed. He...

He's angry, and I...
I don't know what he's gonna do.

694
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:31,275
But I do know I don't want him
to get hurt anymore,

695
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:33,317
so will you look out for him, Danny?

696

Yeah, yeah. Of course, I will, Ms. Harvey.
I'll definitely do that.

Well, then I'd be in private practice,

774
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:42,150
but I'm afraid
I would still have to say no.

775
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:44,025
You've got to help.

776
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:46,317
Things haven't been the same
since it's happened.

777
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:50,900
[sighs]
Look...

778
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:54,650
Perhaps, I'm not the kind of doctor
that you need to be talking to.

779
01:05:20,942 --> 01:05:22,233
[objects clattering]

780
01:05:49,108 --> 01:05:50,525
You're gonna need some more milk.

781
01:05:57,108 --> 01:05:57,942
Hello, Wendy.

782
01:05:59,858 --> 01:06:01,983
I've just been reading
some of your stories.

783
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:04,067
You're a dark horse, aren't you?

784
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,817
Ellman, what the fuck
are you doing here?

785
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,317
After all these years,
can't we at least be civil?

786
01:06:10,108 --> 01:06:12,150
You leave us alone, you fucking bastard!

787
01:06:12,692 --> 01:06:14,442
- Nan!
- Cutz.

788
01:06:14,525 --> 01:06:16,483
Really? The granny?

789
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:21,442
[scoffs] Put her on the bed.
Make sure she's breathing.

790
01:06:21,525 --> 01:06:23,692
- Let me see her.
- Don't worry, she'll be all right.

791
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:25,067
We'll keep an eye on her.

792
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,817
Cutz is a man with a hammer
in a world of china. Know what I mean?

793
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:31,692
Keon, let him go.

794
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:37,733
- [chuckling]
- You're gonna wish you hadn't done that.

795
01:06:38,858 --> 01:06:41,067
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna
fucking do, you little prick?

796
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,483
Cutz, enough.

797
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:51,692
I grew up in this tower block.

798
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,525
My bedroom looked out
the same side as this.

799
01:06:55,608 --> 01:06:57,317
- View's changed a bit.
- What do you want?

800
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:00,358
To reminisce uninterrupted. Is that okay?

801
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,608
You see, back in the day,
when I was in short trousers,

802
01:07:03,692 --> 01:07:05,192
this whole area was a shit-hole.

803
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:08,900
Now, it's just us...
in the shadow of millionaires.

804
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:11,317
How many lads from the estate

805
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,233
do you think make it up
those skyscrapers, Tom?

806
01:07:14,317 --> 01:07:16,608
We have different towers
to climb, don't we?

807
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:19,650
So...

808
01:07:21,692 --> 01:07:25,483
You called. Here I am.
What did you want to say to me?

809
01:07:27,692 --> 01:07:31,692
No? These moments are always better
in our head, aren't they?

810
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:34,108
The French have a word for it.

811
01:07:34,192 --> 01:07:36,817
But then they have a word
for fucking everything.

812
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,817
- I wanted to hurt you.
- Okay, good.

813
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,900
- Now, we're getting somewhere.
- Not anymore.

814
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,608
- You're not worth it. It's over now.
- It's pretty far from over, Tom.

815
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:53,108
You don't call the devil
then get upset when he turns up.

816
01:07:53,192 --> 01:07:55,108
You're not the devil. You're just a cunt.

817
01:07:55,192 --> 01:07:56,358
[chuckles]

818
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,900
I suppose I am a bit, yeah.

819
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,233
What was that?

820
01:08:04,483 --> 01:08:06,025
What is it you're doing?

821
01:08:06,733 --> 01:08:10,067
You've got a little look in your eye
like you're busy.

822
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,858
Are you, Tom?

823
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,650
Are you busy little bee?

824
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:17,858
What you looking for?

825
01:08:20,358 --> 01:08:21,858
Do you know?

826
01:08:21,942 --> 01:08:27,358
I've heard rumors that you can tap
into phones with just your mind.

827
01:08:27,442 --> 01:08:30,817
Break into bank accounts
with the click of a finger.

828
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,942
- Sounds a bit far-fetched, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

829
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:37,192
But do you know...

830
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:38,650
I happen to think...

831
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:42,400
that it's true?

832
01:08:44,692 --> 01:08:46,317
I wouldn't know anything about that.

833
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,900
[sighs]

834
01:08:47,983 --> 01:08:49,483
[scoffs]
Don't do that.

835
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:51,775
That's the difference
between us and them.

836
01:08:53,192 --> 01:08:55,942
They have a modicum of talent,
they shout it from the rooftops.

837
01:08:56,025 --> 01:08:58,442
Us? We have a talent,
we get told to shut up.

838
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:01,025
"Don't show off.
Don't be such a clever bastard."

839
01:09:01,108 --> 01:09:06,192
You're special, Tom.
Don't ever, ever pretend that you're not.

840
01:09:08,192 --> 01:09:09,275
All right, I'm special.

841
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:12,733
What's it got to do with you?

842
01:09:16,525 --> 01:09:20,817
My one gift,
if I may be so bold, is vision.

843
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:23,525
I want to help you fulfill your potential.

844
01:09:24,192 --> 01:09:27,567
I want to give you the opportunity
to change the world.

845
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,692
You mean the opportunity
to make a lot of money.

846
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:34,442
- An obscene amount of money.
- I'll pass.

847
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:37,900
- Why?
- 'Cause go fuck yourself, that's why.

848
01:09:38,983 --> 01:09:40,192
Hey, hey, hey.

849
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:44,150
Okay.

850
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:48,650
Okay. Well...

851
01:09:50,442 --> 01:09:52,108
It was worth a shot.

852
01:09:57,358 --> 01:10:00,192
I've spent a lot of money
bailing my boys out of police custody,

853
01:10:00,275 --> 01:10:01,942
so you owe me.

854
01:10:02,025 --> 01:10:05,358
Now, I want you to ask yourself
one very important question.

855
01:10:06,442 --> 01:10:11,400
"Where, oh, where is Lucy?"

856
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:16,317
[gasps]

857
01:10:18,775 --> 01:10:20,400
You see her, don't you?

858
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,942
She's got nothing to do with any of this.

859
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,733
That's entirely up to you.

860
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:36,483
I don't like this.

861
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:39,108
Next time, get a note
from your fucking mom or something.

862
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:41,608
- I can't kill no girl.
- It ain't gonna come to that!

863
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:43,817
- Yeah, what if it does?
- I'm right here, you know.

864
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,983
Yeah, we see you.

865
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:49,233
What, just like you've seen me
every fucking day since nursery?

866
01:10:49,317 --> 01:10:51,233
Does that mean nothing?

867
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:56,192
Come on, Ant.

868
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,150
We grew up together.

869
01:10:59,942 --> 01:11:01,608
Our moms used to walk us home
from school together.

870
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,608
We used to play
in that little park by the estate?

871
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,650
- Fuck this, man!
- Oi, gag her or something, Haz.

872
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:08,775
I can't listen to her shit anymore, man.

873
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,942
- So, how does it work, then?
- I woke up with it after they shot me.

874
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:25,025
[chuckles]

875
01:11:25,108 --> 01:11:27,692
- You get shot and you get super powers.
- Yes.

876
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,650
- Most people just get dead.
- Lucky, I guess.

877
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:32,900
That's yet to be established.

878
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:38,317
- So go on. Show me what you can do.
- I won't steal for you.

879
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,150
I think you probably might, though.

880
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:48,317
You're gonna do what I say,
or I'm gonna burn your world down.

881
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,733
Danny, can you come in here, please?

882
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:55,942
It was young Daniel here
who first suggested

883
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:57,942
you might be our masked man.

884
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:02,483
And do you know? He didn't even want
to be here to see if he was right.

885
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:05,608
- How long have you known Danny?
- My whole life.

886
01:12:05,692 --> 01:12:07,233
Your whole life.

887
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:12,483
I've never even met the guy
and yet, he gave you up to me.

888
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:15,733
Do you know why?

889
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:21,400
Little pictures of the Queen.

890
01:12:23,525 --> 01:12:27,567
If you're gonna betray a friend,
look him in the eye while you do it.

891
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:31,358
Little pictures of Elizabeth.

892
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,525
Open your mouth, Danny.

893
01:12:39,608 --> 01:12:40,775
Open your fucking mouth.

894
01:12:45,192 --> 01:12:47,567
[breathing heavily]

895
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:53,317
In case you're wondering,
that's what power looks like.

896
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,567
Now...

897
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,900
You're gonna put funds
into my bank account...

898
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:00,942
because I know you can do it,

899
01:13:01,025 --> 01:13:03,817
and I know you're not gonna let me do
the things I'm willing to do if you don't.

900
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,400
Give me your phone, Danny.

901
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,608
Now, fuck off.

902
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:17,108
Okay, none of us are getting any younger.
Let's get this done.

903
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,650
Be a dear and fill her up, will you?

904
01:13:28,275 --> 01:13:29,275
[Ellman gasps]

905
01:13:30,192 --> 01:13:31,317
[chuckles]

906
01:13:32,525 --> 01:13:34,192
Is that as fast as you can go?

907
01:13:36,608 --> 01:13:39,108
I could just dump the entire
Bank of England in there, but...

908
01:13:39,192 --> 01:13:41,442
I think people might start
asking questions.

909
01:13:41,525 --> 01:13:42,358
[chuckles]

910
01:13:42,442 --> 01:13:45,650
You see, I still like this guy
despite everything.

911
01:13:47,858 --> 01:13:49,733
You're a special kid, Tom.

912
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:53,567
A special kid.

913
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:57,025
Looks like we're doing it.

914
01:13:58,358 --> 01:13:59,567
I'm gonna put an X on it.

915
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:01,483
Yeah?

916
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:05,608
Whoever gets the X has got to do it.
Put your hands out.

917
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,942
Are you fucking kidding me?

918
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:09,692
- What'd you expect...?
- Don't talk to her.

919
01:14:09,775 --> 01:14:13,317
Well, I wouldn't shoot
an unarmed girl tied to a chair.

920
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,400
Shut up.

921
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,692
But I guess I'm not a big man
like you, Eugene.

922
01:14:16,775 --> 01:14:18,900
Shut up! Just shut the fuck up!

923
01:14:18,983 --> 01:14:22,650
Why don't you just fucking do it, then?
Isn't that what you want?

924
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,817
- Hey, yo, calm down, man. Come on, man.
- Don't test me, man!

925
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,567
- Chill, mate! Chill, man!
- Get the fuck off me!

926
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,400
- [overlapping chatter]
- [siren wailing]

927
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,983
- Help!

- Shut up.
- [muffled screaming]

01:14:35,942 --> 01:14:38,650
- We gotta fucking go, man!
- Hurry up, man!

930
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:44,608
What just happened?

931
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:46,817
Nothing.

932
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,650
Cutz, check in with the warehouse.

Turn it off.

Fuck.

937
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:12,900
No answer, boss.

938
01:15:16,442 --> 01:15:19,275
All right, let's take this on the road.

Oh, shit. You fucked up.

Tom... of the Crowley Estate Harpers.

945
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:13,275
I knew your mum back in the day.
She was a good time girl.

946
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:15,442
She could light up a room
with her hand jobs.

[men laughing]

948
01:16:18,025 --> 01:16:20,317
You must have been, what,
three when she died?

949
01:16:21,358 --> 01:16:23,567
- Two.
- Two?

950
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,483
I knew her well, you know.

951
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:27,900
Very well.

952
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:33,692
Gosh, you don't think...

953
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:36,442
[men laughing]

954
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:40,650
We both certainly like getting
into a lot of trouble, don't we?

955
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,692
I wasn't actually gonna kill you, Luce.

956
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:56,400
- No?
- No, no, no, no, no.

957
01:16:58,192 --> 01:16:59,108
Calm down.

958
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:04,692
I never used to think you could
rape me... either, Eugene.

959
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:08,150
'Cause we grew up together.

960
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,608
And we were friends, remember?

961
01:17:11,692 --> 01:17:15,525
- What happened was fucked up, I admit...
- You don't get to talk about it!

962
01:17:15,608 --> 01:17:17,650
Fuck you, Ant!

963
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,817
Fuck all of you!

964
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:24,942
Tell me you're ashamed.

965
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:26,358
- I'm ashamed.
- Honestly, I'm ashamed.

966
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:29,400
- I'm ashamed. I swear that I'm ashamed.
- No!

967
01:17:31,483 --> 01:17:33,025
You're scared!

968
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:40,150
If you were ashamed,
you wouldn't be able to even look at me.

969
01:17:42,442 --> 01:17:45,317
So, don't fucking look at me!

970
01:17:50,275 --> 01:17:51,525
Get on your knees, all of you.

971
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:52,942
- Lucy, Lucy...
- Now!

972
01:17:53,025 --> 01:17:55,733
- Lucy, you don't have to do this, please.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

973
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,858
I don't know what happened to you.

974
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:17,817
Well...

975
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:22,567
I have to admit I was expecting you
to be rather more restrained than this,

976

young lady.

977
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:25,567
Bravo.

978
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:29,483
Boys, can you come out here, please?

979
01:18:33,525 --> 01:18:34,983
You haven't shot them, have you?

980
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:37,858
Oh, good.

981
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,817
Gentlemen, everything under control?
Only, the hostage has got the gun.

982
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:48,483
- Lucy!
- [both grunting]

983
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:50,067
Don't fucking move.

984
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:51,400
Tom?

985
01:18:53,525 --> 01:18:54,733
Natural order is restored.

986
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:58,150
Come on, Tom, up you get.

987
01:18:59,442 --> 01:19:01,275
By the way,
I wanted to apologize personally

988
01:19:01,358 --> 01:19:03,650
for the indignities you had to suffer.

989

Like animals, you know?

991
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,233
I wouldn't like me, either.

992
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:19,400
Continue.

993
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:27,608
Come on, Tom.

994
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:29,858
I'm trying.

995
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:35,400
A bit of performance anxiety?

[beeping continues]

If I gave you the option to walk away,
would you take it?

1001
01:19:58,442 --> 01:19:59,608
What?

1002
01:19:59,692 --> 01:20:04,275
If I gave you the option to walk away
and never come back, would you take it?

1003
01:20:05,942 --> 01:20:07,525
Why the fuck would I do that?

1004
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,233
Just thought I'd ask first.

Here's the money Ellman gave me.

What I did was unforgivable. I know that.

I know we're done.
I just wanted to do right by you.

[scoffs]
Why? 'Cause we were friends?

1033
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:41,317
Or 'cause you're scared of me?

1034
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:45,067
Keep it. I don't want it.

1035

I reckon you did us all a favor,
you know, taking him out.

I'm just saying, I know you're probably
beating yourself up about it,

but, guys like that, they gotta get got.

1038

You know, Danny, I was thinking,
I went after everyone in that video,

1039
01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:08,233
but I didn't stop to think
about who was filming.

1040
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:13,817
Maybe you'll get him yet.

Peace, Tom.

Yo.

1043
01:25:22,275 --> 01:25:23,400
Give it to you down there.

1044
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:32,442
Don't jump.

1045

- People got hurt, Tom.

1048

I know.

1049
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:52,817
- I mean, I literally shot a guy.
- I'm sorry, Lucy.

I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

1051

All right.

1052
01:25:58,025 --> 01:25:59,192
I forgive you.

1053
01:26:01,067 --> 01:26:03,775
I see his face whenever I close my eyes.

1054
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:09,233
I see a lot of faces when I close my eyes.
I don't know if it ever really goes away.

1055
01:26:11,317 --> 01:26:13,817
But I'll help you if you help me.

1056
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:25,650
You know, there are restaurants in town.

1057
01:26:25,733 --> 01:26:29,192
People go and then other people
cook for them. It's really great.

1058
01:26:29,275 --> 01:26:31,275
- You should try it.
- [chuckles]

1059
01:26:32,692 --> 01:26:33,858
The view's pretty good, though.

1060
01:26:39,358 --> 01:26:41,483
So, are you gonna stick around, then?

1061
01:26:45,608 --> 01:26:46,900
In case you need me?

1062

In case I want you.
