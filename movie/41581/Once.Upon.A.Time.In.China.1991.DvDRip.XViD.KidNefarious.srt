1
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:06,899
Look, look! They are shooting at us .

2
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,665
Oh! It's just a dragon dance!
     Return to your posts!

3
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,263
Drums!

4
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:48,735
Master Wong,
be careful of the ship's cannons.

5
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,085
- Want to come up ?
- Yes !

6
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,531
Give me the tail!

7
00:04:05,052 --> 00:04:06,849
" Bravery Soaring."

8
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,252
" Magnanimity Overflowing."

9
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:25,005
Look, Wong.

10
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:29,441
More foreign ships
are anchoring in our docks.

11
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,344
Britain has Hong Kong.
Portugal has Macao .

12
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:36,110
Russia occupies Heilongjiang.

13
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:42,384
Our country is divided
and I'm sent to V ietnam ...

14
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,617
to fight the French.

15
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:51,789
How will the V ietnamese react
to this plaque that says...

16
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,925
" Our Land Our People" ?

17
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,026
- Come!
- Yes , Your Excellency!

18
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,697
Take it down! Quick!

19
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,866
- Yes !
- Wait a minute

20
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:06,074
Excellency, the government
changes its policies often .

21
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,240
You could be called back soon.

22
00:05:10,785 --> 00:05:15,745
The government's factionalized .
It has cut my forces .

23
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,848
I think that while I'm gone ..

24
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:22,589
the men that remain here
will be dismissed .

25
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:26,656
You 're the chief trainer
of my Black Flag Army.

26
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:30,261
I hope you 'll organize them
into a local militia ..

27
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:35,867
so when China is under foreign attack,
they can defend it.

28
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:39,304
Master Wong.

29
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:41,574
Rise

30
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,586
Excellency, don't worry.
I hope you 'll be back soon.

31
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:49,847
Wong Fei Hung!

32
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:53,052
All the unequal treaties our government
signed are written on this fan .

33
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,887
When you look at it,
you 'll remember me

34
00:05:55,963 --> 00:06:00,662
When I return,
I hope the treaties will be erased .

35
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,591
Pork buns!

36
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:31,303
Here they come

37
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,753
What are you talking about?

38
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:25,494
The town's full of foreigners.

39
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:29,058
How clever of you
to do business with them .

40
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:33,004
I couldn 't succeed in China
so I went to England

41
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:36,065
Take a photo with Old Chu' s bird

42
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:38,168
The bird will be truly honored .

43
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:42,443
- Don 't mention it. You take one too !
-Thank you very much.

44
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:47,719
- Master Wong!
- How are you , everyone

45
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,747
Fei Hung!

46
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:51,882
Great Uncle, long time no see .
You look great.

47
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,089
Thank you !
Fei Hung, see who' s with me

48
00:10:57,364 --> 00:11:01,460
- Master Wong! Had tea yet ?
- Many are expecting you .

49
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:07,735
- Aunt 1 3?
- Fei Hung!

50
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,745
- She wants to shake your hand
- Foreigners shake hands .

51
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:15,304
Let me introduce you .
This is Joanna

52
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,942
- How do you do ?
-" Do" ? What is that ?

53
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:19,713
She's asking,
"How do you do ?"

54
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:22,051
Sayy thank you .
Thank you !

55
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:25,057
- I kill you !
- You 're welcome

56
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,253
- Fei Hung, take a photo with the bird
-Okay !

57
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:31,688
Sit.

58
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,063
- Fei Hung, taking photos is easy.
- How ?

59
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,403
Look there

60
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:41,168
Don 't move,
or the photo will be no good

61
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,303
Ready ! One, two, three !

62
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,378
What happened ?

63
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,085
It's boiling water !

64
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,520
- How are you ? Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.

65
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,257
This foreigner 's game
is too dangerous.

66
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,299
Too much powder.

67
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,062
- You told me not to move
- Are you all right?

68
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,562
Great Uncle,
I'm glad you asked me to come ..

69
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,632
or you could' ve ended up
like the bird

70
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:17,040
That 's right.

71
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,510
Old Chu

72
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:22,610
Old Chu

73
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:26,881
I'll go back to England in a few days.

74
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,515
Your Aunt 1 3 was in England
but insisted on coming back.

75
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,082
At least she won 't mix
with those foreigners.

76
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:37,759
- Please watch over her for me
- Watch over her ?

77
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:49,167
Old Chu, answer me
You 're frightening me

78
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,877
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

79
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,684
Anyone here

80
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,889
I'm looking for Master Wong.

81
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,235
Who is it? What 's up ?

82
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,039
- I'm from May County.
- May ... May ... May .

83
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,876
I'm Leung Foon.
I want Master Wong to teach me

84
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:31,349
- He--
- He's not here

85
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,978
- I--
- You ?

86
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,612
- I am --
- You are ?

87
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,657
- Wong. Master Wong.
- You 're Master Wong?

88
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:42,594
- No-- Yes !
- Ah, so you are Master Wong?

89
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:45,131
I'm a herdsman .
I practiced kung fu with my cow .

90
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,759
The cow kicked me
Please look at my arm .

91
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:51,969
Okay !

92
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,375
Not this one This one

93
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:02,310
Master Wong,
I hurt my arm .

94
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:08,780
Oh , too late now !

95
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,085
It's stiff, Master .
Why is it stiff?

96
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:19,959
Are you all right?

97
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,869
Master , perhaps you
want me to teach kung fu

98
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:28,874
- No
- No? Not good enough

99
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,603
No? Not good enough?

100
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,344
Okay ? I'll do my best.
I can attack. I can defend

101
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,851
Not a bad stand

102
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:44,252
Not good enough?
I get it!

103
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:46,258
I'll roll a few more for you .

104
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:56,795
What 's this noise

105
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:01,431
- Who is he
- Master is teaching me kung fu

106
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:04,068
Buck Teeth So
is teaching you kung fu

107
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:06,510
- Who are you ?
-Buck Teeth So !

108
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,140
- You are not Master Wong?
-Stupid

109
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,050
Buck Teeth So .
Who are you ?

110
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,988
- He is Master Wong's disciple
- And who are you ?

111
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,322
I'm also Master Wong's disciple, Kai .
What happened to your arm and leg ?

112
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:23,557
Don 't ask. I have to get back
to the theater . I'm going.

113
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,096
Have to go before he binds
my other side .

114
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:44,383
Foon, have you finished mending
the hole on the roof?

115
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,214
The show will start soon!

116
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:50,017
I'm here to act,
and you make me fix the roof.

117
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,081
It's not right, and I'm scared

118
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,526
If you don't do it,
how do I know you can act?

119
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:58,724
When I'm famous,
I'll make you do it every day .

120
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:18,749
What are you doing?
A somersault? What are you doing?

121
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,580
I thought it was
the ship's cannon .

122
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:23,748
It was only thunder.

123
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:29,319
If it's true , we'll all go
and work at gold mines in America

124
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:32,465
We don't have to toil here

125
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,401
Don 't move, or you 'll spoil it.

126
00:16:38,105 --> 00:16:40,096
A foreign woman speaking Chinese

127
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,437
China will be occupied
by foreigners soon.

128
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:52,343
Wait for me

129
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,351
- One, two...
- Wait for me

130
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,029
Wait for you ?

131
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:30,415
It's stuck!

132
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:36,724
- Foon, where the hell are you ?
- I'm changing!

133
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,027
Come out! Quick!
Don 't be lazy!

134
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,000
Foon, you brag about
your kung fu skills.

135
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,163
All you can do is climb roofs
and fix things.

136
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:51,337
- Broke the stage with a somersault.
- Can you do it?

137
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:57,979
Miss, the clothes that got dirty
have been washed .

138
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:00,451
- I've asked someone to iron them .
-Thank you , Boss.

139
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:07,252
- Do you need fresh water ?
- No, I'm fine

140
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:39,148
Who is it?

141
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,758
You didn 't--

142
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:53,697
- I'll invite you to our next new show .
- Good Boss!

143
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:56,106
Take care . The road is slippery .

144
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,771
A Chinese pretending
to be a foreigner !

145
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,453
Miss!

146
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,150
Umbrella

147
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:58,294
Sir, no need to rush away .

148
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:01,135
Come up .
There are lots of girls here

149
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,931
What took him so long?

150
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,546
- A gunshot ! What 's the matter ?
- Who is it?

151
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:21,877
Master ! Master !

152
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:30,528
- Master !
- It's Wing. Open the door .

153
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:33,831
Master !

154
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,135
You opened the door just in time,
or I'd have broken it.

155
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,768
We'll have tea sometime
My treat.

156
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:47,039
Excuse mE

157
00:21:49,216 --> 00:21:51,707
- Kai , who' s been shot ?
- It's the greengrocer .

158
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,083
- Who shot him?
- I don't know . Ask Master .

159
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,723
Buck Teeth So , if not for me,
you 'd break something.

160
00:22:01,795 --> 00:22:04,730
- P-P-Por -- Porky.
- My name's Wing.

161
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,288
Call me Porky
and I'll get fat .

162
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,494
Back for so long
and still don't speak Chinese

163
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,562
- P-Porky.
-B-Buck T-Teeth.

164
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,505
So , get me the medicine

165
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:17,805
You don't speak Chinese
How can you handle medicine

166
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,277
What are you quarreling about?

167
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:22,474
Master ,
I'm teaching him how to be Chinese

168
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,609
- Give me " The Magic Healer ."
-" The Magic Healer ."

169
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,778
Three .
They 're all three characters.

170
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:30,118
Master , I can 't read

171
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,423
And you laugh at those
who don't speak Chinese

172
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:34,755
Come, So .

173
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:40,732
" Powder for 7 Cuts."
"Blood-Clotting Powder."

174
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,765
So is from America

175
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:47,932
Studied medicine there,
learns bonesetting here

176
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,942
Then he's quite good

177
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,536
- Master , here's the water .
- Finally.

178
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:58,513
Rest. You 'll be fine

179
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,519
Master ,
this is a bullet from a shotgun .

180
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,145
Let 's bandage him first.

181
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:05,887
Many ships,
and too many colors in the flags.

182
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:10,862
So he boarded the wrong ship
and got shot .

183
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:14,032
The " Westernization Movement"
is now underway .

184
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,227
When there's trouble,
we Chinese suffer .

185
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:20,934
How can we Chinese survive

186
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,339
The Manchurians have taken our land

187
00:23:25,412 --> 00:23:28,438
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country.

188
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:33,144
Brothers of the local militia
let 's act!

189
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:39,355
- Ca-Ca-Calm down!
- Are you lecturing me

190
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:40,586
P-P-Porky.

191
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,423
Watch your tongue .
Call me Big Brother .

192
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,520
- Wing!
- Master !

193
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:49,168
You 're too rash. Keep out of this.

194
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:53,504
This is a matter of life or death.

195
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:56,201
I must sort this out
with the authorities .

196
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:02,113
Otherwise, how can we Chinese
live here anymore

197
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:24,602
Excuse me, sir.
You would like something?

198
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,072
- So , you explain it to the captain.
- Yes !

199
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:52,320
How come your English
is so fluent?

200
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,866
This way , please

201
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,433
Why so many swords
and daggers on the table

202
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:17,050
So , ask them to bring us
some dim sum .

203
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:31,568
Foon, your job
is to check tickets today .

204
00:25:31,638 --> 00:25:34,766
I'm here to learn acting,
not check tickets. Doesn't sound right.

205
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:38,777
I can 't help it.
All the others have gone to A merica

206
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:43,009
America? Mining for gold
Boss, is there really gold there

207
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:47,851
Would I lie to you ?
It's all in the newspaper .

208
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,446
I'd go, too ,
if I didn 't have to run this place

209
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:54,392
Newspaper ?
What newspaper ?

210
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:56,622
They 're here
for protection money .

211
00:25:57,797 --> 00:25:59,196
You haven 't paid

212
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:01,961
Yes , I have,
but these thugs are from Shaho

213
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,704
How dare they venture
out of their patch?

214
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,239
If I deal with them ,
they 've had it!

215
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,207
Yes !

216
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:11,835
- What are you doing?
- I know you know some kung fu

217
00:26:11,911 --> 00:26:14,505
Didn 't you say
you want to make it big?

218
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:16,173
Here's your chance

219
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,648
Boss, I'm not good at kung fu

220
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:23,121
They 've all come here
just to honor you .

221
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:26,249
I'm being set up .
I'm in big trouble

222
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,729
Boss, open the gate
Boss, open up ! Quick!

223
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,197
No daytime show .
No ticket .

224
00:26:33,266 --> 00:26:36,633
Thank you , Boss.
I'll come another time

225
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:38,568
Hey , kid come down!

226
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,770
Damn. I came a long way ,
and there's no show .

227
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:44,070
Next time I won 't bother .

228
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:51,040
I know you 're Foon.
Are you here to talk to me

229
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:52,641
No, I'm here to check tickets.

230
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,380
We're here to collect
protection money .

231
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:57,014
You 're brave ..

232
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,685
facing us alone

233
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,354
You 've got guts!

234
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:06,592
You 're kidding.
Let me buy you a gift.

235
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:09,630
No need

236
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:15,006
No need for gifts.
just a hand will do .

237
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:17,872
Chop my hand off?
Chop your mother 's head off!.

238
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,415
Don 't go

239
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:29,050
Okay , it's too many against one

240
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:32,990
Let 's fix a time
and place for a duel .

241
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,960
Don 't bother .
Let 's do it right here and now .

242
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:47,639
Get him! Stop !

243
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:58,848
- Someone's fighting in the theater .
- Yes , with knives !

244
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,979
Don 't run ! Stop !
Get him!

245
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,150
Excuse us ! Excuse us !

246
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,453
- What 's happening?
- Fighting!

247
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,154
Fight outside . We're doing
business here Out! Out!

248
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,464
What is it, pal ?

249
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:17,298
They demand protection money
and want to challenge me ..

250
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,099
but they 're too many against one

251
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,572
Kill the dumb fool!

252
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:25,334
- Armageddon over there Go and look!
- Where

253
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:35,950
That 's Porky, Wong's disciple

254
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:39,925
I've never met him.

255
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:42,826
Porky, for your master 's sake ..

256
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,329
I'll let you go today .

257
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:49,167
- So you 're Master Wong's disciple
- I am !

258
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:51,999
I saw the junior doctor
at Po Chi Lam .

259
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:53,470
That Chinese A merican .

260
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,665
- Foon!
- What ?

261
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:57,272
I'm not kidding.

262
00:28:57,343 --> 00:29:01,575
If you don't bring a hand to Shaho,
I'll make you disappear from Fa Shan .

263
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:03,707
Let 's go back to Shaho

264
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,249
Chicken out
because W ong's disciple is here

265
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,788
You want a hand
Take this hock!

266
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,194
Big Brother , what shall we do ?

267
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,355
" Do" ?
Let 's tear them apart !

268
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,496
Brother Wing,
this one's for him!

269
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:29,598
It's free .
I'm not doing business today .

270
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:33,137
You stinky boy !

271
00:30:02,742 --> 00:30:06,542
Shaho' s stupid
Shaho' s dumb--

272
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,088
If you give me any trouble,
I'll beat you to death!

273
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:35,707
Have some pudding! Enjoy the show !
Bean curd pudding!

274
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,918
Take that ! Hold it!

275
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:02,732
Add a little water ,
make a perfect brew .

276
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:05,703
Boiling water !
Who threw it? Find him!

277
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,138
Go up and see !

278
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:13,135
Who dropped the boiling water ?
Out! Go

279
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:15,203
Old fool, it must be you .

280
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:17,909
- Not me I've been eating pork buns.
- Pork buns?

281
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:41,133
This is General Wickens
of the British forces .

282
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:43,767
Mr.Jackson
of the Sino Pacific Corporation .

283
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:46,073
They 've kindly agreed
not to press charges ...

284
00:31:46,145 --> 00:31:49,239
so stop making demands
for the greengrocer .

285
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:52,045
This is unjust.
The people are outraged .

286
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:56,521
Outraged ?
Wong, you have no authority.

287
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,386
You are just a civilian .

288
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,949
Who are you to negotiate

289
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:03,860
The W esternization Movement
is about relationships with foreigners.

290
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:08,056
It's better to keep the peace

291
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,164
These rolls are made
from our flour.

292
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,168
So you appreciate W estern food

293
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,011
The foreigners
draw boundaries here ..

294
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,571
and set up forbidden areas .

295
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:27,517
If we fight each other
and defer to them ...

296
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,987
then soon we'll lose the flour
to make rolls.

297
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,985
You 're friends with Lau
of the Black Flag Army...

298
00:32:36,062 --> 00:32:39,896
but he doesn't follow orders
from the Central Government.

299
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:44,562
I've been sent here to watch you .
I intend to set an example

300
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,245
Are you all right?

301
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,854
Master , it's our local militia

302
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:17,962
Master Wong!

303
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,402
Stop them !

304
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,640
Stop !

305
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:26,912
Don 't fight!

306
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:29,539
Kai ! I told you
to tell them not to fight!

307
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,741
I told you not to fight!

308
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,517
Put down the weapons!
Still fighting?

309
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:45,387
Don 't move

310
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,409
- You 're quite good
-Of course

311
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:12,752
Big Brother ,
that looks like Master Wong.

312
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,383
Master Wong.

313
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,792
We outnumber him.
Let 's take him on !

314
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,091
Don 't fight!

315
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,935
Don 't fight!

316
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,877
Did he hit you ?
Don 't fight!

317
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,340
Don 't fight, Kai !

318
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:37,507
I told you not to fight!

319
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,352
I said don't fight!
Are you still fighting?

320
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:45,623
- Really? Stop ?
-They 're coming. Let me go

321
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:55,161
Big Brother , are you all right?

322
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:56,758
- Who just kicked me
- Don 't know !

323
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,671
- Have you taken them on ?
- Yes , we have

324
00:35:01,741 --> 00:35:02,935
Carry on !

325
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:11,606
- Buck Teeth So !
-Stupid

326
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:29,400
So , tell them
they 've made a mistake

327
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:30,492
Mr.Jackson --

328
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,231
No need to explain.

329
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:36,035
If China had no forbidden areas ,
we'd be unsafe

330
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,700
Master , this alien
can speak Chinese

331
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:41,068
Still attacking?

332
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:45,546
Don 't call me an alien ,
Chinese Devil!

333
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:48,413
You listen .
We're doing business with you .

334
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:51,285
If we don't use our heads ,
how are we going to make big money ?

335
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:55,623
Wong Fei Hung,
you 'd better mind your own business.

336
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,630
Otherwise, you 'll get yourself
in big trouble

337
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,430
Good-bye, Chinamen !

338
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,836
Shoot whoever resists.
Let 's move

339
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:18,076
The authorities are here
Let 's get outta here

340
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,543
Stop ! Don 't move

341
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:24,816
Drop your weapons!
Why is the local militia fighting?

342
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:28,050
Where's Porky?
Has he gone

343
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:33,256
Don 't move,
or else we'll shoot!

344
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,196
Wong, this area
is rented by the foreigners.

345
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,100
The local militia
is making trouble here

346
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:42,334
You 're in charge
How do you explain this?

347
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:46,845
Excellency, they were trained
by the government...

348
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:48,903
so they would not act
without a reason .

349
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:51,142
" Reason " ? What the government
has discarded , you retain.

350
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,151
The local militia is
under our command from now on .

351
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,516
Excellency--

352
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,614
Tell them to report to city hall
or they 'll be arrested !

353
00:36:58,691 --> 00:36:59,783
Excellency--

354
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:02,225
Master Wong will pay
for all of the damages !

355
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:03,886
Yes , Your Excellency!

356
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:21,710
Beware of fire
Beware of thieves

357
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,220
Master , I've lost my appetite

358
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,817
I hear this was started
by a gang from Shaho

359
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,760
City hall now requires us
to report in.

360
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,390
Will they take us into custody?

361
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,024
Master !

362
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:45,601
Sit!

363
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,105
City hall is authorized
to look into this.

364
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:53,645
If it's a setup ,
they 'll find out the truth.

365
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:56,647
So let 's eat.
Until the verdict is known...

366
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,615
this will be
our last meal together .

367
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,147
Let 's eat.

368
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,642
Listen , local militia
Prepare to eat!

369
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,606
Pick up the food

370
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,045
Eat rice! Swallow !

371
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:35,785
Pick up the food

372
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:40,682
Eat rice! Swallow !

373
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,570
Aunt 1 3!

374
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,009
Don 't worry.
The local militia will be fine

375
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,946
It's late
Why don't you sleep?

376
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,715
I want to take your measurements
for a suit.

377
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:17,721
A suit? Why would I want
to wear a Western suit?

378
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,924
It's for when you go abroad

379
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,600
Aunt 1 3,
is the W est so wonderful ?

380
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:32,004
Why do we have to learn
from the W est?

381
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:35,978
They invented the steam engine
and many other things.

382
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:38,516
If we don't learn,
we'll get left behind

383
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:46,290
When you have time,
you have to tell me more ..

384
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,985
about how great
the outside world is.

385
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:05,874
Aunt 1 3...

386
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:11,214
if it's so great,
why would you want to come back?

387
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:17,651
There's something here
that they haven 't got .

388
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,214
What haven 't they got ?

389
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:23,359
People

390
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,031
People that I want to see .

391
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:40,902
I was away for two years,
but my heart was here

392
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,414
In fact, you were always
in my thoughts.

393
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,808
You are very sweet.

394
00:40:49,588 --> 00:40:51,818
- Aunt 1 3!
- What 's wrong?

395
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,450
I thought--
No, it's nothing.

396
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,723
Fei Hung, you and I
are relatives by name ..

397
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,354
not by blood

398
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:02,696
We grew up together .
Don 't call me A unt 1 3.

399
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:06,999
But you are my senior .
Let me do it.

400
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:18,508
Which one is it?
Doesn't matter .

401
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:20,211
" Doesn't matter " ?

402
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:23,254
Of course it does matter .
One must be true to oneself.

403
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,548
Chinese shouldn 't wear suits.

404
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,456
Chinese are Chinese
Westerners are Westerners.

405
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:32,794
There soon will be railways
and a telegraph company.

406
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,858
Everything will change
China will change with the world

407
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,904
You 're right.

408
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,376
Western guns and ships are here

409
00:41:46,445 --> 00:41:50,677
Everything is changing.
No one knows what we will become

410
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,978
I appreciate your gift,
but you can keep it for me

411
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:59,216
When all Chinese wear suits,
I'll wear one

412
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:32,152
- Get away ! Get away !
-OnlyJesus is the truth.

413
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:34,351
Get away !
Get away ,Jesuit!

414
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:36,856
Who' s in charge here

415
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,763
Sir, we already paid
the protection money .

416
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,858
Come greet your business protector .

417
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,403
Sir, we already bought
the business protection .

418
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,132
Did you buy the protection from me,
or from the old one

419
00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,909
He's now dead in a well.
Want to see him?

420
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,344
just buy a new one

421
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,247
What if the old thug comes ?

422
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:02,714
- Sir, want to order anything?
- Can 't you see I'm busy?

423
00:43:03,822 --> 00:43:06,450
- Yes , sir! Life is tough right now !
- Give me the money ...

424
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,015
so that we can
take care of you .

425
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,721
Sir, don't clean me out.
Leave me some change

426
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,991
And who' ll give me some change
Give all of it!

427
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,427
You take advantage of people
in these hard times ?

428
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,363
It's Master Wong!

429
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,007
You 're from Shaho?
Come with me to city hall.

430
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:26,043
Protect me

431
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,791
Stabbing your own people

432
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,733
Get away ! Move

433
00:44:03,081 --> 00:44:06,107
Hurry! Out of my way !
Where are my men ? Those idiots.

434
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,664
Go to hell!

435
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:33,673
Damn, it's high!

436
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:46,379
- Bravo
- All right! How wonderful !

437
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,291
Did you see Master Wong
do his " Shadowless Kick" ?

438
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:54,025
Everyone, this man
extorts protection money .

439
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,794
I'm taking him to city hall.

440
00:44:55,867 --> 00:44:57,994
Please come and be witnesses .

441
00:44:59,938 --> 00:45:03,704
He's impressive
He did an amazing jump.

442
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:06,505
Boss, he wants
protection money from you .

443
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:10,947
- Come with me to be a witness.
- Witness?

444
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:14,679
And live my days worrying,
like the theater boss?

445
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:19,383
You were practicing kung fu in there
I saw no fighting.

446
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,362
In America
people have to walk carefully.

447
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:29,126
Because they trip on gold

448
00:45:29,201 --> 00:45:31,829
- How is that possible
-There's more

449
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:35,634
Wash your face in the river ,
you 'll find gold

450
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:38,175
- Is it really so wonderful ?
-Of course it is!

451
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:41,940
One visit is worth
a lifetime of work in China

452
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:47,150
Have some leaflets.
One for everyone

453
00:45:47,753 --> 00:45:51,280
People there wear dark glasses
day and night.

454
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,415
The shining gold will hurt your eyes .

455
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:55,483
You can 't pick up gold
if you 're blind

456
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:03,093
Lost sheep,
God 's Kingdom belongs to you .

457
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,128
Are you promoting America too ?

458
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:08,968
Material things are transient.

459
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:12,636
OnlyJesus is the truth.

460
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:15,236
You should follow Him
and experience life

461
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:20,110
I arrested a criminal today .
WillJesus be my witness?

462
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:52,583
Beware of fire
Beware of thieves

463
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,285
Big Brother !

464
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,791
- Big Brother , are you over there
- I'm here

465
00:47:04,596 --> 00:47:05,893
Get ready .

466
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,677
- Master !
- How are you ?

467
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,082
Are you crazy? Fanning when
it's so windy outside .

468
00:47:27,152 --> 00:47:29,450
City hall locked up
the local militia?

469
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:31,648
They won 't release them
until the suspect is caught.

470
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:34,117
Master .

471
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:38,452
I can 't be a witness
because I'm a suspect.

472
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:41,958
They even let go Hung of Shaho

473
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:46,896
When will the local militia
be released ?

474
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,037
When someone comes forward
to be a witness.

475
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:56,237
Master , how about Foon?

476
00:47:57,115 --> 00:48:00,050
- Foon? Do you know him?
- Yes .

477
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:03,917
You must be a part of this.
What didn 't you tell me

478
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,587
I...

479
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,054
Master , you don't
always trust me, so I--

480
00:48:12,364 --> 00:48:14,355
You what ? Speak!

481
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,958
M-M-Master .
Th-There

482
00:48:21,706 --> 00:48:23,071
Smoke

483
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:31,144
- Fire
- Calm down, So !

484
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:33,309
- Don 't panic!
- Master !

485
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:36,420
So !

486
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,851
What shall we do ?

487
00:48:42,928 --> 00:48:43,986
The arrows came
from the pharmacy's roof.

488
00:48:44,062 --> 00:48:45,996
So , Master is coming to save you !

489
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:48,658
Never mind me
Gather the valuables !

490
00:48:49,434 --> 00:48:53,234
Kai , get your weapon .
We'll take them on .

491
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:56,437
Wing, put out the fire
I'll take care of them .

492
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:58,032
Alone

493
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,412
Damn!

494
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,819
So ! Here

495
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:22,230
Goddamn steps!

496
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:27,369
His Excellency's fan ? It is!

497
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:39,379
Wow ! The rooftop fire is big!

498
00:49:39,451 --> 00:49:42,113
It's even big--
bigger down here

499
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:49,793
Someone's on the roof!.
Shoot him!

500
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,164
It's Master Wong.
Go Run !

501
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:19,885
Po Chi Lam is on fire

502
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:31,594
Po Chi Lam will be no more
if it's burnt.

503
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,799
What are you doing, Aunt 1 3?

504
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:39,343
Taking a photo of Po Chi Lam .

505
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,141
- A photo Your butt is on fire
- You 're blocking the sign.

506
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:44,579
A little more
I can 't see you .

507
00:50:45,383 --> 00:50:46,475
Shouldn 't we wait for Master ?

508
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:49,247
The roof is-- is on fire

509
00:50:52,123 --> 00:50:54,148
So , look this way !

510
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:00,059
Kai , shift a little to the right.

511
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:48,509
I thought I had it with me ..

512
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,743
but I was taking pictures
of Po Chi Lam .

513
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:55,985
You 're just like
a foreign hag ...

514
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:58,147
caring only for trivia

515
00:51:58,223 --> 00:52:00,282
Don 't ever bring this
into the clinic again...

516
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,556
or I'll throw it away !

517
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:18,843
His Excellency
the governor is here

518
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:19,639
His Excellency
the governor is here

519
00:52:29,821 --> 00:52:34,315
Wong Fei Hung, you open schools,
triad societies ...

520
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:37,953
divide up the town
and run an illegal business.

521
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,826
Now other triads take revenge

522
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:43,298
The burning of Po Chi Lam
is your own fault.

523
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,427
It's time to mend your ways!

524
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:49,069
Excellency,
schools are not triad societies .

525
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:55,138
If the authority
labels martial arts illegal ...

526
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:01,978
then our grand tradition
will be lost.

527
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,248
So , when we are attacked
by the enemy...

528
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:06,688
how will we defend ourselves ?

529
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:08,885
Is that what you call
courting peace

530
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:13,661
You can 't save your Po Chi Lam ,
and you dare lecture me

531
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:17,395
It's city hall's job
to investigate the fire

532
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:19,562
Then you tell me
Who did it?

533
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:21,930
- I don't know .
- You don't know !

534
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:23,735
You 're hiding things from me

535
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,105
Brother Wing!

536
00:53:33,017 --> 00:53:35,986
- What are you doing? Go in!
- Master !

537
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:42,318
- May I come in?
- Foreigner ! Why do you come here

538
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:44,088
- Wing!
- Master !

539
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,857
Keep going on like this,
and you can stop calling me Master !

540
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:48,990
Don 't go

541
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:51,968
You must come here to file complaint
against Wong Fei Hung.

542
00:53:52,036 --> 00:53:53,503
You can tell me

543
00:53:56,674 --> 00:54:00,974
Wong Fei Hung, I know
who set Po Chi Lam on fire

544
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:03,240
I can be your witness.

545
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:06,642
Check to see
if anyone's from Shaho

546
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:08,652
- Hey , are you from Shaho?
- No

547
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,381
Not the way you talk.

548
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:14,218
There are so many people here

549
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,728
Big Brother ,
seems city hall may get you .

550
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,629
Goddamn! That Jesuit
must have told on me

551
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:22,359
Shouldn 't we leave
and hide in Shaho?

552
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:24,930
No need for that !

553
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:27,335
We're afraid of city hall.
They 're afraid of the foreigners.

554
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:29,805
So let 's find the most powerful
foreigner in town!

555
00:54:31,576 --> 00:54:32,804
Wait for me

556
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:39,883
We want to speak to Mr.Jackson !

557
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,211
Damn! We don't speak English.
Try harder .

558
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:51,559
Please, please,
let us in to see Mr.Jackson !

559
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:54,120
We all want to see Mr.Jackson !

560
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:11,477
If I keep a dog,
it will guard my house

561
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:16,009
You are wanted by city hall.
What good is it if I help you ?

562
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:18,282
I'm not afraid
of being arrested .

563
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:21,454
But I am afraid that ,
without a leader...

564
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,756
my brothers' talents
will go to waste

565
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:27,491
You come all this way
to make money ...

566
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:30,090
send so many Chinese to A merica

567
00:55:30,168 --> 00:55:34,104
Why don't I give you
some women to ship over ?

568
00:55:34,172 --> 00:55:38,336
No, we don't allow the laborers
to have wives .

569
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:41,173
Otherwise,
they 'd stay there forever .

570
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:45,046
Not wives , whores .

571
00:55:45,116 --> 00:55:46,879
As many as you want.

572
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:50,887
It's Master Wong
who always interferes .

573
00:55:51,856 --> 00:55:53,721
Dare you kill him for me

574
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:10,330
- Wong Fei Hung?
- Yes .

575
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:13,172
- I'll invite him to the show tomorrow .
- Yes !

576
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:17,874
Then he'll be killed by me
or the authorities .

577
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:12,427
Wing! City hall's
after the Shaho Gang.

578
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:14,698
Foon, where were you ?

579
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:16,865
I've got to go back to the theater .
Come with me

580
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:20,536
- Wait. Let me lock up first.
-Okay !

581
00:57:21,846 --> 00:57:24,508
- Hey , come out first.
-Oh , right!

582
00:57:33,424 --> 00:57:36,860
This is Wing, the one
who can solve any problems.

583
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:39,055
Master Wong's disciple, welcome

584
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,258
I won 't see the show for free .
I'll check tickets. I like gate duty.

585
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,426
- Thank you , indeed .
- Never mind

586
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,031
Ticket . Have you got tickets?

587
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:18,296
Those with tickets get in.

588
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,564
Do you have tickets?

589
00:58:20,638 --> 00:58:24,130
Ticket ? Do you know who I am ?

590
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:29,043
Look at the sign.
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.

591
00:58:29,113 --> 00:58:31,172
And I'm Wing!
No ticket ? Go

592
00:58:32,016 --> 00:58:35,417
The show 's starting,
and you tell us to leave

593
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:37,977
Okay , we'll go
We'll go

594
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,080
Got tickets?

595
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:42,483
Brother Wing, let 's go in.

596
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,552
- No hurry. The actors aren't there
-Thank you so much.

597
00:58:46,764 --> 00:58:49,096
Have you seen Wonder Ho
and White Gent?

598
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:52,068
They tried to barge in.
I turned them away .

599
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:56,300
- What ? They 're the actors.
-Then who will act?

600
00:58:56,374 --> 00:58:59,969
Then we don't have a show .
Stay here I'll go fetch them .

601
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:01,705
Tickets.

602
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:11,213
Master has come You help.
I've got to use the toilet .

603
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:12,779
Excuse me

604
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:22,164
-I can 't imagine foreigners invited you .
-Please

605
00:59:28,473 --> 00:59:30,941
Aunt 1 3.

606
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:32,908
Master Wong.

607
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:36,909
Why so detached ?

608
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:40,246
Relatives must respect
the rule of seniority.

609
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,980
- Let 's just watch the show .
- Please

610
00:59:45,056 --> 00:59:47,889
- Please
- Please

611
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:54,730
Wing, we're in trouble

612
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,198
Master 's here
Idon't want to watch the show .

613
00:59:56,267 --> 01:00:00,135
The actors are gone
You 're going. What 'll I do ?

614
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:02,832
- I can sing.
-So what ?

615
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:05,375
I can act a little Let 's go

616
01:00:05,443 --> 01:00:08,935
You dare sing on stage
in front of the master ?

617
01:00:10,047 --> 01:00:12,641
Fool. Who will recognize us
with makeup on ?

618
01:00:12,717 --> 01:00:15,811
Okay , let 's take a chance
Come backstage

619
01:00:16,554 --> 01:00:18,920
Lucky you got us ,
or the show would be cancelled .

620
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,550
- Amazing that you could recognize me
- Isn't that Porky Wing?

621
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:25,323
Who' s Porky Wing?
Let 's go. Go

622
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:27,921
The W hite Snake
is now a Fat Snake

623
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,339
Porky! Porky!

624
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:52,650
Hey , Porky's changed professions.

625
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:54,884
Where will we get
our pork from now ?

626
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,789
Wing again!

627
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:10,329
Nonsense

628
01:01:10,408 --> 01:01:12,876
I got him to do it.
Don 't blame him.

629
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:16,402
Pack up and never come back!

630
01:01:17,949 --> 01:01:20,349
Brother Wing, I'll join you
in the pork business.

631
01:01:38,502 --> 01:01:40,197
Watch out!

632
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:50,135
Duck!

633
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:59,648
Seal all passageways!

634
01:01:59,724 --> 01:02:01,954
- Lead the foreigners out.
- Right!

635
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,589
There's fighting outside .

636
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:10,396
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.

637
01:02:10,468 --> 01:02:12,163
Go after them !

638
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:15,137
Aunt 1 3!

639
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:22,903
Stop it!

640
01:02:30,855 --> 01:02:32,846
Don 't shoot at the audience

641
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:34,619
Don 't shoot!

642
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,690
Son!

643
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:32,645
Limestone powder!
Close your eyes .

644
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:41,758
Don 't get up .

645
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,772
- Master Wong!
- Don 't worry about him. Let 's go

646
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,941
Protect His Excellency!

647
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,449
Come on .

648
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,627
Gun !

649
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:21,732
Hide .

650
01:04:25,936 --> 01:04:30,270
Aunt 1 3, take the gun
and hide with the reverend

651
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:33,674
They came for me
Don 't stay here

652
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:49,152
Come with me

653
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,085
Master , take the pole

654
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,679
Master , I'll help you !

655
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:55,358
The floor's too thin.

656
01:05:58,062 --> 01:06:01,429
- Master , I'll help you .
- Who are you ?

657
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,592
Help Aunt 1 3.
Idon't need help.

658
01:06:31,428 --> 01:06:33,259
Leave her alone

659
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:06,362
Reverend Father !

660
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:16,368
Wing, come and protect Aunt 1 3!

661
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:24,241
They 've gone backstage

662
01:07:43,734 --> 01:07:45,224
Come up here

663
01:07:48,973 --> 01:07:50,668
Damn it!

664
01:08:04,521 --> 01:08:07,718
- Why did you ambush me
- It's you who ambushed me

665
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:10,589
- Foon?
- He's Foon?

666
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:13,221
It's dangerous here
There are killers inside .

667
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,595
Question him.
I'm going to have a look.

668
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:18,692
- Foon, what are you doing?
- How would I know ?

669
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:21,670
He's been hitting me
ever since he came in.

670
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:24,230
Foon! Don 't move

671
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:27,800
- You say don't move and still hit me
- Let 's sort this out.

672
01:08:27,945 --> 01:08:29,742
Run ! Run !

673
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,912
Master Wong, don't move

674
01:08:39,757 --> 01:08:42,385
- Your Excellency.
- You shut up !

675
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,484
Excellency, they left something.

676
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:50,427
What ? " Glory to Local Militia
End to foreigners" ?

677
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:53,561
Weren 't all the local militia arrested ?

678
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,641
How many have you given shelter to?

679
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,078
Your Excellency, I've been set up .

680
01:09:04,114 --> 01:09:06,810
Don 't believe him.
Arrest these Shaho thugs.

681
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:08,545
What Shaho thugs?

682
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,587
That 's the second time
you 've hit me

683
01:09:11,655 --> 01:09:14,522
- Find the truth before you lay blame
-The truth?

684
01:09:19,129 --> 01:09:21,120
He's taking protection money .

685
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,133
- My master takes protection money ?
- Yes , it's him.

686
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:27,965
Master Wong--
isn't he from Shaho?

687
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,563
What Shaho?
The Y ellow River ?

688
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,871
You don't need to explain.

689
01:09:35,946 --> 01:09:40,042
City hall will soon arrest
your other members.

690
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:45,077
But I'm going to arrest you first
and close your Po Chi Lam .

691
01:09:45,155 --> 01:09:47,419
How will you make trouble now ?

692
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:50,324
A lot of people
were hurt at the theater .

693
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:52,419
Let me tend to them .
Then I'll go with you .

694
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:57,895
All right, go ahead
You 'll be guarded

695
01:09:57,968 --> 01:10:02,598
If anything happens, I'll arrest
and execute you on the spot !

696
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,476
Don 't move You 're bleeding.

697
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,276
- Fetch the medicine
-Okay .

698
01:10:15,953 --> 01:10:18,649
Go away . Can 't you see
the eviction notice

699
01:10:24,661 --> 01:10:26,754
That doesn't give you
permission to steal!

700
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,491
Bring them back!

701
01:10:29,733 --> 01:10:31,928
- You dare hit us ?
- Go away !

702
01:10:32,002 --> 01:10:33,993
Don 't you have
anything better to do ?

703
01:10:34,071 --> 01:10:37,404
Master , they are stealing.
I'm stopping them .

704
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:40,966
So what ? Wanna fight?
I'll fight with you .

705
01:10:41,044 --> 01:10:43,774
- Okay , let 's go
- I mean, I'll fight you !

706
01:10:44,882 --> 01:10:48,215
- I fight you ?
- Where would you like to be hit?

707
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,310
Is it here Here

708
01:10:52,723 --> 01:10:55,123
You want me arrested sooner ?

709
01:10:55,192 --> 01:10:57,888
If not , don't stop me
from saving people

710
01:10:57,961 --> 01:10:59,087
Master !

711
01:10:59,163 --> 01:11:02,530
You 're so manipulative
You used us .

712
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:05,625
We'll arrest you
if you stand in our way .

713
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:11,639
He's smart ,
avoiding arrest this way .

714
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:22,443
Come hit me

715
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:45,297
Mr. Cheng!

716
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,043
Still bleeding.
Fetch me the " Cure-A ll" !

717
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:52,015
" Cure-A ll" !

718
01:12:09,266 --> 01:12:13,259
He's dead . Tell his family.

719
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:24,580
So .

720
01:12:40,998 --> 01:12:42,761
Fei Hung!

721
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,630
What 's the tattoo ?

722
01:12:45,702 --> 01:12:49,035
It's some A rabic numerals
and "Jackson " ?

723
01:12:49,106 --> 01:12:51,939
Is it his ship's name

724
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:56,973
Don 't worry.
I'm Wong Fei Hung.

725
01:12:57,047 --> 01:13:00,483
You 're hurt.
If you move, you 'll tear the wound

726
01:13:01,852 --> 01:13:05,379
You 're Master Wong?
Help me

727
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:10,890
Get up .
Where are you from ?

728
01:13:10,961 --> 01:13:12,019
America

729
01:13:12,963 --> 01:13:15,022
America?

730
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,594
We crossed seas...

731
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,036
were denied medicine when ill.

732
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:25,939
Many were thrown overboard.

733
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:29,535
In America...

734
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:33,071
we were branded like pigs.

735
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,443
We were cheated ...

736
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:41,115
by the Chinese dealers here.

737
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:43,819
We signed contracts,
paid for food and the trip.

738
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:46,761
We paid for so many things.

739
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:51,062
Those who tried to escape
were caught and killed .

740
01:13:52,169 --> 01:13:54,967
I came back to China

741
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:58,633
I-I-- Master Wong.

742
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:04,410
Don 't worry.
You 're back in China now .

743
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,447
Let me see if I can
find your family.

744
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:11,976
Don 't think too much.

745
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:17,983
Kai , keep secret his contract
with the foreigners...

746
01:14:18,061 --> 01:14:20,291
or city hall will arrest him.

747
01:14:20,364 --> 01:14:22,696
I understand

748
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:29,203
Going to A merica' s
better than staying here

749
01:14:29,272 --> 01:14:33,572
Don 't miss out!
Come Take a look!

750
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:36,134
You want one

751
01:14:37,614 --> 01:14:40,777
Going to A merica?
How can I get there

752
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,876
Take a look for yourself.

753
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:46,622
- The same A merica as in the newspaper ?
- Right!

754
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,956
If you want to go, pay a poll tax ,
your passage, rental , blanket and food

755
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,825
Get a three -year contract.

756
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:55,023
You mean it costs
two years' salary ?

757
01:14:55,098 --> 01:14:56,759
- Haven 't you got money ?
- No

758
01:14:56,833 --> 01:15:00,030
Then don't even think about it.
Shove off!.

759
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:03,231
You want one
It's full of gold there

760
01:15:03,306 --> 01:15:05,797
Someone's fighting over there

761
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,401
Duel? Let 's go and watch it.

762
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:10,969
Don 't go Don 't go

763
01:15:15,285 --> 01:15:18,118
You dare show off
in front of my house ..

764
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:22,318
and hit my disciple

765
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,384
- What 's your name
- Master Yim.

766
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:57,621
I'm matchless in 1 9 provinces
with my " Seven Swordsmanships" .

767
01:15:57,694 --> 01:16:02,063
You 're a guest,
so I'll let you thrust three times .

768
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:05,796
Then prepare .

769
01:16:26,223 --> 01:16:28,418
Number two

770
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:57,577
Still number two,
and you already draw your sword

771
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,781
You will get killed .

772
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:03,418
- Let 's forget it.
- Don 't go

773
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,553
Hit me in the back?

774
01:18:01,785 --> 01:18:03,616
" Armor Pugilism" !

775
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:09,657
I've let you thrust three times .
Admit defeat.

776
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,990
There must be a way to beat him.

777
01:19:33,076 --> 01:19:36,204
- What are you following me for ?
- My name is Foon, from May County.

778
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:40,477
There are lots of gangs in this town.
My kung fu is poor.

779
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,680
I'm often harassed .
I can 't even make a living.

780
01:19:44,754 --> 01:19:48,622
Please take me as your disciple

781
01:19:52,696 --> 01:19:56,223
What 's the use of being
a kung fu expert? Can 't make a living.

782
01:20:12,382 --> 01:20:16,216
Master , are you hungry?

783
01:20:16,286 --> 01:20:19,881
You take shelter .
I'll think of something.

784
01:20:22,826 --> 01:20:25,693
- Good
- Give me a drumstick!

785
01:20:25,762 --> 01:20:29,095
Good food
We don't eat bad food

786

- Master !

949
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:46,056
He's your disciple
Call him Brother Foon.

950
01:37:46,135 --> 01:37:48,535
Brother Foon!

951
01:37:50,172 --> 01:37:52,072

956
01:38:08,223 --> 01:38:11,715
Master Yim,
this is for you to open a school.

957
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:15,958
Yim's Pugilism
will conquer Fu Shan .

958
01:38:16,031 --> 01:38:18,556
Come Let 's toast Master Yim!

959
01:38:19,868 --> 01:38:21,199
Cheers!

960
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:25,292
Don 't move
What do you want?

961
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:29,494
Master Wong, we all admire you .

962
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:32,369
We know you 've been set up .

963
01:39:34,076 --> 01:39:36,567
Master Wong,
we've decided to free you ...

964
01:39:36,645 --> 01:39:40,046
and we'll take
responsibility for it.

965
01:39:40,115 --> 01:39:42,140
Master Wong, this way .

966
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:45,317
Great! Let 's go, Master !

967
01:39:47,923 --> 01:39:49,550
Master !

968
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:53,928
There are laws in China
I won 't make a mockery of them .

969
01:39:53,996 --> 01:39:57,693
- Go, Master !
- Please, go

970
01:39:57,766 --> 01:40:01,600
No, Excellency.
Iappreciate it, but I won 't go

971
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:04,833
- Wong?
- Master Wong is over there

972
01:40:05,507 --> 01:40:08,169
Mas -Master !

973
01:40:08,911 --> 01:40:10,902
Master , you should go

974
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:14,142
- So !
- Master -Mas -Mas --

975
01:40:15,117 --> 01:40:16,550
Speak slowly.

976
01:40:16,618 --> 01:40:19,587
Aunt 1 3 and I took that man ,
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.

977
01:40:19,655 --> 01:40:22,886
They killed him and captured Aunt 1 3.
Think of something to save her !

978
01:40:22,958 --> 01:40:25,222
What ?

979
01:40:25,294 --> 01:40:27,785
Master Wong,
let 's go and save her .

980
01:40:30,632 --> 01:40:33,362
- Wing, I'll give you a few men .
- Good

981
01:40:33,435 --> 01:40:34,993
- Let them go
- Yes .

982
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:38,096
So , how come you didn 't stutter ?

983
01:40:38,173 --> 01:40:40,835
I was rehearsing all the way .

984
01:40:57,492 --> 01:40:59,551
Isn't that Master Wong?

985
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:07,535
Aren 't they the local militia?

986
01:41:26,388 --> 01:41:29,448
Master , you 're great!

987
01:41:29,524 --> 01:41:31,549
You even beat Wong Fei Hung.

988
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:33,993
Give us a little demo

989
01:41:35,597 --> 01:41:38,862
just a little Just a little

990
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:58,813
Okay !

991
01:42:34,456 --> 01:42:37,016
Bitch! The hell with you !

992
01:43:26,608 --> 01:43:28,701
That 's enough, Master !
Enough!

993
01:43:35,951 --> 01:43:37,942
Master , that 's enough!

994
01:43:38,019 --> 01:43:39,782
What 's wrong?

995
01:43:39,855 --> 01:43:43,814
The money is dirty.
Don 't accept it.

996
01:43:43,892 --> 01:43:47,384
What ? Are you insulting us ?

997
01:43:47,462 --> 01:43:49,987
What do you mean?
Are you looking down on us ?

998
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:54,928
Nothing in this world is perfect.

999
01:43:55,003 --> 01:43:57,995
Virtue is often found
among the lowly.

1000
01:43:59,374 --> 01:44:03,242
Our priority is
to make our name in Fa Shah .

1001
01:44:03,311 --> 01:44:07,714
When that 's achieved ,
we can talk justice

1002
01:44:09,117 --> 01:44:13,816
That 's life
Foon, pick up the money .

1003
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:33,269
Pick up the money !
Pick up the money !

1004
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:37,735
Pick up the money !

1005
01:44:47,923 --> 01:44:50,016
Pick up the money !

1006
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:53,060
Pick up the money !
Pick up the money !

1007
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,897

01:45:03,972 --> 01:45:06,600
Pick up the money !

1009
01:45:07,375 --> 01:45:10,344
You think you 're Brother Foon?
I think you 're nobody!

1010
01:45:10,412 --> 01:45:11,470
Foon!

1011
01:45:14,382 --> 01:45:16,509
Pick up the money !

1012
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:24,587
Pick up the money !

1013
01:45:30,732 --> 01:45:33,166
Pick up the money !

1014
01:45:34,469 --> 01:45:35,902
Make our name in Fa Shah ?

1015
01:45:35,971 --> 01:45:38,531
That 's life That 's life

1016
01:46:07,135 --> 01:46:08,534
Brother Foon!

1017
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:12,438
Bastard !

1018
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:18,303
Damn you !

1019
01:46:27,589 --> 01:46:30,080
Aunt 1 3, wake up !

1020
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:31,887
Wake up !

1021
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,520
Bastard ! Don 't touch me

1022
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:36,962
Don 't scream.
I've come to help you .

1023
01:46:43,805 --> 01:46:46,239
Foon, is it you ?

1024
01:46:46,308 --> 01:46:48,674
- So many people are coming!
- Quickly! Go

1025
01:47:04,426 --> 01:47:06,155
Get that woman !

1026
01:47:20,141 --> 01:47:20,869
Foon!

1027
01:47:21,142 --> 01:47:24,407
Stop or I'll kill this woman .

1028
01:47:26,614 --> 01:47:29,139
Our Brother Foon?
Go to hell!

1029
01:47:29,451 --> 01:47:31,442
Hit me

1030
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:33,419
Damn you !

1031
01:47:33,955 --> 01:47:36,082
- Master , they 're inside .
- Let 's go in!

1032
01:47:36,324 --> 01:47:37,814
What 's going on ?

1033
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,356
Master , Foon found out
my wife is pretty...

1034
01:47:41,429 --> 01:47:43,897
and tried to seduce her .

1035
01:47:43,965 --> 01:47:46,433
- He's lying!
-Shut up !

1036
01:47:51,773 --> 01:47:55,436
Foon, you scum .
Apologize to your brother .

1037
01:47:56,845 --> 01:47:59,313
Yim, we met at Po Chi Lam .

1038
01:47:59,381 --> 01:48:01,440
Shut up , you bitch!
Go

1039
01:48:03,985 --> 01:48:05,316
You dare to disobey me

1040
01:48:06,821 --> 01:48:09,289
Stupid She's not his wife

1041
01:48:09,524 --> 01:48:10,650
Stupid

1042
01:48:10,725 --> 01:48:12,852
She's related to W ong Fei Hung.

1043
01:48:13,962 --> 01:48:15,429
Wong Fei Hung?

1044
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,269
Foon is trying to escape

1045
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:25,070
Escape

1046
01:48:51,566 --> 01:48:52,965
How dare you !

1047
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:03,841
Stop !

1048
01:49:04,612 --> 01:49:06,273
Get him!

1049
01:50:16,518 --> 01:50:18,713
- Take it easy!
- Yes , Big Brother .

1050
01:50:18,786 --> 01:50:20,549
- It hurts.
- Right.

1051
01:50:22,357 --> 01:50:26,157
Master , I was set up
by these people

1052
01:50:26,227 --> 01:50:28,889
They 'll do the same to you .
Don 't trust them .

1053
01:50:29,497 --> 01:50:32,398
You don't trust your brothers,
yet speak out for Wong?

1054
01:50:33,601 --> 01:50:35,535
How is it? Too cruel?

1055
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:37,798
Not used to it?

1056
01:50:41,576 --> 01:50:44,602
Let him go
I'll do anything you want.

1057
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:47,079
What makes you want
to sacrifice for him?

1058
01:50:47,148 --> 01:50:48,706
You 'll do anything?

1059
01:50:48,783 --> 01:50:49,772
Bargain with me

1060
01:50:49,851 --> 01:50:50,875
Damn you .

1061
01:50:51,252 --> 01:50:53,186
Are you Master Wong's woman ?

1062
01:50:56,357 --> 01:50:59,349
When I'm done with you ,
your face will be so scarred ...

1063
01:50:59,427 --> 01:51:02,157
Wong Fei Hung won 't recognize you .

1064
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:07,092
Where's the woman
you took away today ?

1065
01:51:08,269 --> 01:51:11,534
Big Brother !
Master Wong is here

1066
01:51:12,073 --> 01:51:13,472
Wong Fei Hung?

1067
01:51:14,876 --> 01:51:17,538
- Fei Hung?
- Arm yourselves .

1068
01:51:18,713 --> 01:51:20,476
- Get all the guns out.
- Right!

1069
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:21,879
Go

1070
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:23,645
Get all the women on the ship.

1071
01:51:23,718 --> 01:51:26,118
Master , Wong challenges us .

1072
01:51:26,187 --> 01:51:28,314
- You 've got to help us .
- Don 't worry.

1073
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:31,817
Foon!

1074
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:34,657
- Go
- Aunt 1 3!

1075
01:51:34,729 --> 01:51:36,026
Go

1076
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:39,992
Let 's go get Wong Fei Hung!

1077
01:51:51,913 --> 01:51:54,780
You 're not needed here
Go search for Aunt 1 3.

1078
01:51:54,849 --> 01:51:56,043
Yes !

1079
01:51:57,452 --> 01:51:58,885
Master Wong!

1080
01:52:00,221 --> 01:52:02,849
Master Yim, win or lose ..

1081
01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:04,755
it's just a game

1082
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:09,025
You 've got no excuse not to fight.

1083
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:16,362
As you wish.

1084
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:19,332
It's down there

1085
01:53:20,034 --> 01:53:21,365
" Iron Defensive Skill" ?

1086
01:53:21,803 --> 01:53:25,330
Today only one of us
leaves here alive

1087
01:53:27,742 --> 01:53:29,073
Hey , how do you fire a gun ?

1088
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:02,102
Don 't worry! We have guns!

1089
01:54:39,781 --> 01:54:42,716
And you said you 're good
Come on !

1090
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:50,723
I'll help you , Master .

1091
01:54:53,161 --> 01:54:54,287
Porky Wing?

1092
01:55:06,507 --> 01:55:07,974
Any more

1093
01:55:29,096 --> 01:55:30,290

Come up here

Aunt 1 3's been kidnapped
by the Shaho Gang. Sayve her !

1096
01:55:41,442 --> 01:55:43,467

Brothers, get inside !

01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:56,974
Brother Wing, any more

Kai , I'll stay and help Master .

1107
01:59:33,874 --> 01:59:35,205
Wong Fei Hung!

1108
02:00:16,016 --> 02:00:18,416
It's all in self-defense

1109
02:00:18,786 --> 02:00:20,515
You call this Yim's Martial Arts?

1110
02:00:21,355 --> 02:00:24,085
The world' s full of surprises .
Must take precautions.

1111
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:30,086
Be quick! The ship's leaving.
Take them aboard

1112
02:00:31,398 --> 02:00:34,629
- Go, bitch!
- Fei Hung, it's Aunt 1 3!

1113
02:00:34,702 --> 02:00:36,966
Fei Hung!

1114
02:00:48,249 --> 02:00:51,776
Fei Hung, it's Aunt 1 3!
Fei Hung!

1115
02:00:51,852 --> 02:00:56,880
Bring her to the ship.
Go Bitch.

1116
02:00:56,957 --> 02:00:58,322
Fei Hung!

1117
02:01:02,763 --> 02:01:08,531
Mr.Jackson , he's here
It's Wong Fei Hung. Go get him!

1118
02:01:09,503 --> 02:01:10,834
The ship's over there

1119
02:01:11,038 --> 02:01:15,031
Hung! Take all the women
to the cabin.

1120
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,552
Go down, quick!

1121
02:01:49,677 --> 02:01:51,167
There

1122
02:03:21,335 --> 02:03:24,827
Wong-Wong Fei Hung!

1123
02:03:28,208 --> 02:03:30,540
Master Yim, we are done

1124
02:03:38,585 --> 02:03:40,576
Master Wong!
Watch out!

1125
02:03:46,327 --> 02:03:49,728
Wong Fei Hung, where are you ?
We haven 't finished yet .

1126
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:02,338
Master !

1127
02:04:12,553 --> 02:04:15,283
My Armor Pugilism.

1128
02:04:15,356 --> 02:04:18,848
Master Yim!

1129
02:04:25,032 --> 02:04:29,162
- Master Yim!
- Wong.

1130
02:04:30,371 --> 02:04:32,134
We can 't fight guns...

1131
02:04:32,206 --> 02:04:36,802
with kung fu

1132
02:04:49,757 --> 02:04:51,281
You scum !

1133
02:05:57,658 --> 02:05:59,558
Wong Fei Hung! Don 't move

1134
02:06:03,297 --> 02:06:04,594
Hold your fire

1135
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:27,673
Foon!

1136
02:07:28,315 --> 02:07:29,612
Kill him!

1137
02:07:35,055 --> 02:07:36,386
Watch out!

1138
02:07:54,308 --> 02:07:58,108
Master Wong, have the guts
to fight man to man .

1139
02:07:59,313 --> 02:08:02,976
Fei Hung, he's got a gun on his knife
Don 't fall into his trap !

1140
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:03,982
Shut up !

1141
02:08:22,469 --> 02:08:26,872
Bitch, you brought them here,
so I'll burn your face

1142
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:29,670
Wong Fei Hung! Let 's see
which is faster , you or my gun .

1143
02:08:34,214 --> 02:08:36,079
Die

1144
02:08:42,055 --> 02:08:43,784
Let me go

1145
02:09:15,188 --> 02:09:18,487
Mr.Jackson and the Shaho Gang
sold women to A merica

1146
02:09:18,892 --> 02:09:20,416
Your Excellency, save us .

1147
02:09:21,528 --> 02:09:26,329
Shaho Gang!
Get all the women and go

1148
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,597
By law , you must hand them
to our government.

1149
02:09:34,508 --> 02:09:37,272
- You have violated international law .
- Put down your gun !

1150
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:41,003
- Why won 't it fire
- Did we forget to reload it?

1151
02:09:41,948 --> 02:09:44,849
If you don't put it down,
I'll kill him!

1152
02:09:44,918 --> 02:09:46,510
Put down the gun !

1153
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:03,499
You can 't hurt a Chinese official ,
even if you have diplomatic immunity.

1154
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:04,969
How will you explain
to my government?

1155
02:10:05,038 --> 02:10:09,168
I'll go back to A merica
after I kill all of you !

1156
02:10:11,411 --> 02:10:14,847
Then I won 't have to explain
to any government!

1157
02:10:21,688 --> 02:10:23,212
You scum !

1158
02:10:23,423 --> 02:10:24,947
You don't have to explain!

1159
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:42,474
- Your Excellency.
- What a courageous deed !

1160
02:10:42,542 --> 02:10:45,340
Child' s play . No big deal .

1161
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:50,143
Thank you , Your Excellency!

1162
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:53,144
Master Wong, thank you for
working with the City Hall.

1163
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:55,654
- Don 't mention it.
-Thanks, Master Wong.

1164
02:11:10,404 --> 02:11:14,067
China' s changed so much.
How can I cope

1165
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:18,571
America- -
Do they really have gold there

1166
02:11:19,379 --> 02:11:21,404
If they really do have gold ..

1167
02:11:21,782 --> 02:11:24,273
why would those foreigners come here

1168
02:11:25,285 --> 02:11:28,083
Maybe we're standing on gold now .

1169
02:11:57,217 --> 02:12:00,277
After this drink,
you'll be my master.

1170
02:12:00,353 --> 02:12:03,413
But Aunt 1 3 and I
are so close now.

1171
02:12:03,490 --> 02:12:05,549
We'll be together
from morning to night.

1172
02:12:05,625 --> 02:12:07,422
If one day she marries me...

1173
02:12:07,494 --> 02:12:10,156
then you'll have to call me Uncle 1 3.

1174
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:11,857
I'll become your senior...

1175
02:12:11,932 --> 02:12:15,129
and that means
you'll have to serve me.

1176
02:12:15,969 --> 02:12:18,301
Foon, what are you thinking?

1177
02:12:19,906 --> 02:12:21,840
Have some tea , Master !
