1
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,730
Look, look! They are shooting at us.

2
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:23,613
Fire!

3
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,681
- Oh! This is a dragon dance!
- Return to your post!

4
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:51,141
Drums!

5
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,187
Master Wong, be careful
of the ship's cannons.

6
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:17,083
Want to come up? - Yes!

7
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,425
Give me the tail!

8
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:15,099
"Bravery Soaring."

9
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:20,605
"Magnanimity Overflowing"

10
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,034
Look, Wong...

11
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,578
More foreign ships

12
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,413
are anchoring in our docks.

13
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,876
Britain has Hong Kong,
Portugal has Macau,

14
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,920
Russia occupies Heilongjiang.

15
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:46,923
Our country is divided

16
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:49,008
and I'm sent to Vietnam...

17
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,887
to fight the French.

18
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:59,477
How'll the Vietnamese react to this

19
00:05:00,187 --> 00:05:01,980
plaque that says "Our Land Our People"

20
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,274
- Someone come!
- Yes, your Excellency!

21
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:06,651
Take it down! - Yes!

22
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:09,028
Quick! - Wait a minute!

23
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:14,242
Excellency, the Govt.
Changes its policies often...

24
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:16,411
You could be called back soon.

25
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:21,165
The Govs factionalised,

26
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,543
and has cut my forces.

27
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:25,795
I think that whilst I'm gone...

28
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,339
the men that remain here

29
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,049
will be dismissed.

30
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:34,721
You're the chief trainer of my Black Flag Army.

31
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,391
I hope you'll organize them into a local militia.

32
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:42,145
So when China is under foreign attack,

33
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,522
they can defend it.

34
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,483
Master Wong...

35
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:50,320
Rise!

36
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,116
Excellency, don't worry!
I hope you'll be back soon.

37
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,286
Wong Fei Hung!

38
00:05:58,537 --> 00:05:59,620
The unequal treaties

39
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,706
are written on this fan.

40
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:04,000
When you see it, you see me.

41
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:05,626
When I return,

42
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:09,213
I hope the treaties will be erased.

43
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:53,503
Pork buns!

44
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:34,460
Halleluja!

45
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,632
Here it is!

46
00:09:45,514 --> 00:10:23,509
Halleluja!

47
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,303
What are you talking about?

48
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:33,352
The town's full of foreigners.

49
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,521
How clever of you

50
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:37,440
to do business with them.

51
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:39,400
Couldn't succeed in China,

52
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:41,193
so went to England.

53
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,987
Take a photo

54
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,363
with Old Chu's bird.

55
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,198
The bird will truly be honoured.

56
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,285
Don't mention it. You take one too!

57
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:51,495
Thank you very much.

58
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:53,873
Master Wong!

59
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,584
How are you, everyone?

60
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,336
Fei Hung!

61
00:10:58,337 --> 00:11:00,129
Grand uncle, long time no see. You look great.

62
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,757
Thank you! Fei Hung,

63
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,884
see who's with me?

64
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,181
Master Wong! Had tea? Many are expecting you.

65
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,936
Aunt 13? - Fei Hung!

66
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,148
She wants to shake your hand.

67
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,858
Foreigners shake hands.

68
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,569
Let me introduce you. This is Joanna.

69
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,862
How do you do?

70
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:26,113
What do...

71
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,032
She's asking: How do you do?

72
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,034
Say thank you ah. Thank you!

73
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:33,412
Oh, kill you. You're welcome!

74
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:35,623
Fei Hung, take a photo with the bird.

75
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:36,957
Okay!

76
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,503
Sit...

77
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,713
Fei Hung, taking photos is easy.

78
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:44,215
How?

79
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:45,466
Look there.

80
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:50,388
Don't move... Or the photo with be no good.

81
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:56,310
Ready, 1, 2, 3!

82
00:11:58,814 --> 00:12:01,107
What happened?

83
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:06,654
Is boiling water!

84
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:10,741
- How are you? Are you hurt?
- I'm alright!

85
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:12,702
This foreigner's game is too dangerous.

86
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,161
Too much powder.

87
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:15,996
You told me not to move!

88
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:16,997
Are you alright?

89
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,960
Grand Uncle, I'm glad you asked me to come...

90
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:23,504
or you coulïve ended up like the bird.

91
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,131
Thas right.

92
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:31,178
Old Chu!...

93
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:33,931
I'll go back to England in a few days.

94
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:36,600
Yee was in England...

95
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,728
but insisted on coming back.

96
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,731
At least she won't mix with those foreigners.

97
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,235
- Please watch over her for me.
- Watch over her?

98
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:57,913
Old Chu, answer me, you're frightening me.

99
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:04,044
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

100
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,386
Anyone here?

101
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:19,351
I'm looking for Master Wong.

102
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:30,654
Who is it? Whas up?

103
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,115
- I'm from May County.
- M... ay... May... May.

104
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:36,702
I'm Leung Foon. I want Master Wong to teach me.

105
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,455
He... - He's not here?

106
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:42,750
I... I am... - You? You are?

107
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:45,753
- Wong... Master Wong...
- You're Master Wong?

108
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:50,925
No... yes! - Ah, so you are Master Wong?

109
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:53,302
I'm a herdeman. I practiced Kung Fu with my cow.

110
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:56,055
The cow kicked me. Please look at my arm.

111
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,142
Good!

112
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,395
Not this one. This one.

113
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,567
Master Wong. I hurt my arm...

114
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,028
Why you wrapped my leg?

115
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,701
Oh... too... late... now!

116
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,623
Is stiff, Master. Why's it stiff?

117
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:28,921
Are you... alright?

118
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:32,967
Master, perhaps you want

119
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:34,468
to teach me Kung Fu?

120
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:35,803
No...

121
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:39,139
No? Not good enough?

122
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,228
OK? I'll do my best. Can attack. Can defend.

123
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,146
Not a bad stand.

124
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,274
Stupid!

125
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:52,611
Still not good? I get it!

126
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:54,446
I'll roll a few more for you.

127
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,666
Whas this noise?

128
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,378
Who is he? - Master is teaching me Kung Fu!

129
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,714
Buck Teeth So is teaching you Kung Fu?

130
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:14,550
Who are you? - Buck Teeth So!

131
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,553
You are not Master Wong? - Stupid!

132
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:22,308
Buck Teeth So, who're you?

133
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:23,976
He is Master Wong's disciple.

134
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,269
And who are you?

135
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,313
I'm also Master Wong's disciple,

136
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,731
Kai what happened to your arm and leg?

137
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:31,191
Don't ask. I have to get back to the Theater.

138
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,902
I'm going.

139
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:38,699
Have to go before he binds my other side.

140
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:52,588
Foon, have you finished mending
the hole on the roof?

141
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,131
The show will start soon!

142
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm here to act, and you make me fix the roof.

143
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:00,346
Is not right and I'm scared.

144
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,766
If you don't do it how do I know you can act?

145
00:16:04,017 --> 00:16:05,225
When I'm famous,

146
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,603
I'll make you do it everyday.

147
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:23,869
Whare you doing? A somersault?

148
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,206
Whare you doing?

149
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:30,000
I thought it was the ship's cannon.

150
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,961
It was only thunder.

151
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,837
If is true,

152
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,256
we'll all go and work at gold mines in America.

153
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:40,552
We don't have to toil here.

154
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:43,681
Don't move! Or you'll spoil it.

155
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,224
Are you ready?

156
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:48,268
Foreign woman speaking Chinese?

157
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:53,732
China will be occupied by foreigners soon.

158
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:01,156
Wait for me!

159
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:04,410
1, 2. - Wait for me!

160
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:13,502
Wait for you?

161
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,737
Is stuck!

162
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:43,073
Foon, where the hell are you?

163
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:44,867
I'm changing!

164
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,745
Come out quick, don't be lazy!

165
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:51,123
Foon, you brag about your Kung Fu skills.

166
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,208
All you can do is climb roofs and fix things.

167
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,879
Broke the stage with a somersault.

168
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:00,799
Can you do it?

169
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,179
Miss, the clothes that got dirty...

170
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,430
have been washed.

171
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:07,723
I asked someone to iron them.

172
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,516
Thank you, Boss!

173
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:13,145
Do you need fresh water?

174
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:16,565
No, I'm fine.

175
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:47,429
Who's it?

176
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:50,557
You didn't...

177
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,110
I'll invite you to our next new show.

178
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,319
Good, Boss!

179
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,822
Take care, the road is slippery! - Bye!

180
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:08,075
A Chinese pretending to be a foreigner!

181
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:55,956
Miss, umbrella!

182
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,466
Sir, no need to rush.

183
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:09,386
Come up, there are lots of girls here.

184
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,822
It takes so long.

185
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:13,533
Don't move!

186
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:23,293
A gunshot, whas the matter? Who's it?

187
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:30,550
Master! Master!

188
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:39,351
Master! - Is Wing. Open the door.

189
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,479
Master! Master!

190
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:51,238
You opened the door just in time,
or I'd have to break it.

191
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:52,781
We'll have tea sometime, my treat.

192
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,741
Excuse me!

193
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,913
- Kai, who's been shot?
- Is the greengrocer.

194
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:01,331
Who shot him?

195
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:02,874
I don't know. Ask Master.

196
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,256
Buck Teeth So,
if not for me you'd break something.

197
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,258
Por... ky... Porky...

198
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,636
My name's Wing. Call me Porky and I'll get fat.

199
00:22:14,887 --> 00:22:16,805
Back for so long and still don't speak Chinese.

200
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:21,810
Por... ky... - Bu... ck... Tee... th.

201
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,437
So, get me the medicine.

202
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,647
You don't speak Chinese,
how can you handle medicine?

203
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,232
What are you quarrelling about?

204
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:30,402
Master, I'm teaching him how to be Chinese.

205
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,446
- Give me "The Magic Healer".
- "The Magic Healer".

206
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:35,615
3, they're all 3 characters.

207
00:22:36,117 --> 00:22:38,368
Master, I can't read!

208
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,163
You laugh at those who don't speak Chinese?

209
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:43,915
Come, So.

210
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:49,671
"Powder for 7 Cuts", "Blood-Clotting Powder".

211
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:52,758
So is from America.

212
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,009
Studied medicine there

213
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,511
learns bonesetting here.

214
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:58,638
Then he's quite good.

215
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,391
Master, here's the water.

216
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:03,060
Finally.

217
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,897
Take a rest, you'll be fine.

218
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,732
Master, this is a bullet from a shotgun.

219
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,275
Les bandage him first.

220
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:12,736
Many ships,

221
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:13,945
and too many colours in the flags.

222
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,114
So he boarded...

223
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:19,868
the wrong ship and got shot.

224
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,037
The "Westernization Movement" is now underway.

225
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,873
When there's trouble, we Chinese suffer.

226
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:30,128
Can we Chinese survive?

227
00:23:31,047 --> 00:23:33,632
The Manchurians have taken our land.

228
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:37,135
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country.

229
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,640
Brothers of the Local Militia, les act!

230
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:47,604
- Ca... ca... calm down!
- You lecturing me?

231
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:48,814
Por... ky...

232
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:50,774
Watch your tongue, can me Big Brother.

233
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:53,193
Wing! - Master!

234
00:23:54,654 --> 00:23:57,781
You're too rash. Keep out of this.

235
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:01,243
This is a matter of life or death.

236
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:03,161
I must sort this out

237
00:24:03,496 --> 00:24:05,247
with the authorities.

238
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,875
Otherwise how can we Chinese

239
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:10,752
live here anymore?

240
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:33,024
Excuse me sir, you would like something?

241
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,280
So, you explain it to the captain. - Yes!

242
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,325
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson
of Sino Pacific Corporation...

243
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:44,661
and General Wickens of the British Forces

244
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:46,788
have made an appointment with us.

245
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,915
And I presume they should have
reserved a table for this matter.

246
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:51,376
So we can discuss this matter more leisurely.

247
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,629
This is my master, Wong Fei Hung.

248
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:57,048
We'd be gratefull if you'd show us the table.

249
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,427
How... come... your... English... is... so... fluent?

250
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,012
This way please.

251
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,104
Why so many swords and daggers on the table?

252
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:16,318
Excuse me sir, your menu, sir.

253
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:25,785
So, ask them to bring us some dim sum.

254
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:40,175
Foon, your job is to check tickets today.

255
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:41,760
I'm here to learn acting not check tickets,

256
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,303
doesn't sound right.

257
00:25:43,554 --> 00:25:44,679
Can't help it.

258
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:47,098
All the others have gone to America.

259
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,809
America? Gold mining?

260
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:52,062
Boss, is there really gold there?

261
00:25:53,105 --> 00:25:54,189
Would I lie to you?

262
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,982
Is all the newspaper.

263
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:58,944
I'd go too if I didn't have to run this place.

264
00:25:59,987 --> 00:26:02,781
Newspaper? What newspaper?

265
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:05,408
They're here for protection money.

266
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,035
You haven't paid?

267
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:10,747
Yes I have, but these thugs are from Shaho.

268
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,292
How dare they venture out of their patch?

269
00:26:14,544 --> 00:26:16,253
If I deal with them, they've had it!

270
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,671
Yes!

271
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:19,089
What are you doing?

272
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,215
I know you know wome Kung Fu.

273
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,801
Didn't you say you want to make it big?

274
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:25,136
Here's your chance.

275
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:27,013
I didn't mean that.

276
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,349
Boss, I'm not good at Kung Fu.

277
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,226
They've all come here just to honour you.

278
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,479
I'm being set up. Stop!

279
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:39,276
Boss, open the gate! Boss, open up. Quick!

280
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:41,945
No daytime show. No ticket.

281
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,030
I'll come another time.

282
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:47,909
Hey kid, come down!

283
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:50,579
Damn. I came a long way, and there's no show.

284
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,497
Next time I won't bother.

285
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:59,588
I know you're Foon. Here to talk with me?

286
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,006
No, I'm here to check tickets.

287
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:02,507
We're here to collect protection money.

288
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,468
They said you're a good fighter.

289
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,429
You're brave... facing us alone.

290
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,805
You've got guts!

291
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:11,683
You're kidding.

292
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,602
Let me buy you a gift.

293
00:27:13,853 --> 00:27:15,186
I'll visit you guys in a minute.

294
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,690
No need.

295
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,026
No need for gifts,

296
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:25,447
just a hand will do.

297
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,491
Chop my hand off? Chop your mother's head off!

298
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:33,288
Don't go.

299
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,417
Okay, is too many against one.

300
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:41,630
Les fix a time and place for a duel.

301
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:44,466
Don't bother, les do it right here and now.

302
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:57,103
Get him! Stop!

303
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,820
Someone's fighting in the Theater.

304
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:09,199
Yes, with knives!

305
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:12,077
Don't run! Stop! Stop! Get him!

306
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,453
Excuse us, excuse us!

307
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:14,621
Whas happening? - Fighting!

308
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:15,664
Fight out there,

309
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:18,208
we're doing business here. Out! Out!

310
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,879
What is it, pal?

311
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,715
They demand protection money,
and want to challenge me...

312
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,217
But they're too many against one.

313
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:29,469
Kill that dumb fool!

314
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:34,224
- Armageddon over there. Go and look!
- Where?

315
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:45,944
Thas Porky, Wong's disciple.

316
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,904
Never met him.

317
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:51,241
Porky, for your master's sake...

318
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:54,452
I'll let you go today.

319
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:56,454
So you're Master Wong's disciple?

320
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:57,872
I am!

321
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,375
I saw the junior doctor at Po Chi Lam.

322
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:01,668
That Chinese American.

323
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,461
Foon! - What?

324
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,463
I'm not kidding,

325
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,841
if you don't bring a hand to Shaho...

326
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:09,759
I'll make you disappear from Fa Shan.

327
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:12,804
Les to Shaho. - Go!

328
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:15,473
Chicken out because Wong's disciple is here?

329
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:18,685
You want a hand? Take this hock!

330
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,566
Big brother, what shall we do?

331
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:27,068
Do? Les tear them apart!

332
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:35,744
Brother Wing. This one's for him!

333
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,579
Is free, I'm not doing business today.

334
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,250
You stinky boy...

335
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:14,991
Shaho's stupid, Shaho's dumb...

336
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,880
Give me any trouble, I'll beat you to death.

337
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:43,061
Have some puddings, enjoy the show.

338
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:44,562
A bean curd pudding.

339
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:59,327
Take that! Hold it!

340
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:12,131
Add a little water, make a perfect brew.

341
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:14,926
Boiling water? Who threw it? Find him.

342
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,220
Go up and see!

343
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:21,516
Who dropped boiling water? Out! - Go!

344
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:23,101
Old Fool, it must be you.

345
00:31:23,352 --> 00:31:24,769
Not me. I've been eating pork buns.

346
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,312
Pork buns?

347
00:31:36,365 --> 00:31:39,909
And that, Your Excellency,
is the position of Her Majesty's Government.

348
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,120
May I suggest that we leave it at that?

349
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,873
Your Government is most generous

350
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:46,749
Wong Fei Hung!

351
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:49,752
This is General Wickens of the British forces.

352
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:51,880
Mr. Jackson of the Sino Pacific Corporation.

353
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,632
They've kindly agreed not to press charges.

354
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,552
So stop making demands for the greengrocer.

355
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,221
This is unjust. The people are outraged.

356
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:02,348
Outraged? Wong,

357
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,851
you have no authority.

358
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:06,936
You are just a civilian.

359
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,480
Who are you to negotiate?

360
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:11,357
The Westernization Movements is on

361
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:13,067
relationships with foreigners...

362
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:17,322
Is better to keep the peace.

363
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:22,243
These rolls are made from our flour.

364
00:32:23,746 --> 00:32:26,080
So you appreciate western food?

365
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:29,584
The foreigners draw boundaries here...

366
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:31,878
and set up forbidden areas.

367
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,422
If we fight each other...

368
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,174
and defer to them,

369
00:32:36,425 --> 00:32:39,636
then soon we'll lose the flour to make rolls.

370
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,889
You're friends with Lau

371
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,599
of the Black Flag Army.

372
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,309
But he doesn't follow orders

373
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,436
from Central Govt.

374
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:51,272
I'm sent here to watch you.

375
00:32:51,523 --> 00:32:52,941
I intend to set an example.

376
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:05,787
Are you alright?

377
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,003
What is all this?

378
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,803
Master, is our Local Militia.

379
00:33:25,182 --> 00:33:26,557
Master Wong!

380
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:27,976
Stop them!

381
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:31,688
Stop.

382
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:34,857
Don't fight!

383
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:38,152
Kai, I told you to tell them not to fight!

384
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,824
Told you not to fight!

385
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,621
Put down the weapons! Still fighting?

386
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,419
Don't move.

387
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,838
I expect you'd have an explanation

388
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:58,506
for this disgraceful intrusion.

389
00:33:58,757 --> 00:33:59,799
Good day!

390
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:02,760
General Wickens.

391
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,024
You're quite good! - Of course!

392
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,446
Big Brother, that looks like Master Wong.

393
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:22,989
Master Wong.

394
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,116
We are many, les take him on!

395
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:35,001
Don't fight!

396
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:41,591
He hit you? Don't fight!

397
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,384
Don't fight, Kai!

398
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:48,097
Don't fight... - I told you not to fight!

399
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:51,225
- I said don't fight!
- You're still fighting?

400
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:54,520
Really stop? They're coming. Let me go!

401
00:35:01,904 --> 00:35:03,196
Big Brother, are you alright?

402
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:06,115
Who just kicked me? - Don't know!

403
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:09,827
Have you taken them on? - Yes, we have!

404
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,245
Carry on!

405
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,629
Buck Teeth So! - Stupid!

406
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,509
I'm so sorry!

407
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:37,063
So, tell them

408
00:35:37,314 --> 00:35:38,397
they've made a mistake.

409
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:40,024
Mr. Jackson! - No need to explain.

410
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:43,236
If China had no forbidden areas,

411
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:44,529
we'd be unsafe.

412
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,738
Master, this alien can speak Chinese.

413
00:35:48,408 --> 00:35:49,575
Still attacking?

414
00:35:52,454 --> 00:35:54,288
Don't call me a alien "Chinese Devil"!

415
00:35:54,748 --> 00:35:56,916
You listen, we're doing business with you.

416
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,544
If we don't use our heads,
how do we make big money?

417
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:04,090
Otherwise you'll get yourself...

418
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:07,009
in big trouble.

419
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,975
Goodby Chinamen! Les go!

420
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,355
Shoot whoever resists. - Run! Run!

421
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:24,193
The authorities are here!

422
00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:26,904
Les get outta here!

423
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:30,867
Stop! Don't move!

424
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:33,786
Drop your weapons.
Why're the Local Militia fighting?

425
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,581
Where's Porky? Gone?

426
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,544
Don't move, or else we'll shoot.

427
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:45,715
Wong, this area's rented by the foreigners...

428
00:36:45,966 --> 00:36:47,550
The Local Militia make trouble here.

429
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:48,968
You're the Head,

430
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,511
how do you explain it?

431
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:53,806
Excellency,

432
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:55,641
they were Govt. Trained.

433
00:36:55,893 --> 00:36:57,018
So they would not act without a reason.

434
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:59,896
Reason? What the Govt. Discards, you retain.

435
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:01,939
The Local Militia is directly
under us from now on.

436
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:03,441
Excellency...

437
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:05,484
Tell them report to City Hall!

438
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,737
Or get arrested. - Excellency...

439
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:10,364
Master Wong will pay for all the damages.

440
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:12,074
Yes, Your Excellency!

441
00:37:24,004 --> 00:37:39,518
Beware of fire. Beware of thieves.

442
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,229
Master, I've lost my appetite.

443
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,023
I hear this was started by a gang from Shaho.

444
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:45,858
City Hall now requires us to report in.

445
00:37:46,151 --> 00:37:48,236
Will they hold us in custody?

446
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:50,488
Master!

447
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:59,288
Sit! City Hall's authorized to look into this.

448
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,665
If is a set-up,

449
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:01,624
they'll find out the truth.

450
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,833
So, les eat...

451
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:04,168
Until the verdict is know,

452
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:07,046
this'll be our last meal together.

453
00:38:08,548 --> 00:38:09,590
Les eat.

454
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:33,781
Listen, "Local Militia", prepare to eat.

455
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:50,172
Pick up vegetables! Eat rice! Swallow!

456
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:10,234
Aunt 13!

457
00:39:10,986 --> 00:39:12,069
Don't worry,

458
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:13,988
the Local Militia will be fine.

459
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:19,994
Is late, why don't you sleep?

460
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:22,330
I want to take your measurements for a suit.

461
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,583
A suit?

462
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:26,876
Why would I want to wear a western suit?

463
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:29,628
Is for when you go abroad.

464
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:36,344
Aunt 13, is the West so wonderful?

465
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:40,973
Why do we have to learn from the West?

466
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:44,352
They invented things like the steam engine
and many other things.

467
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:45,895
Their science is developed far beyond us.

468
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:47,605
If we don't learn we'll get left behind.

469
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,403
When you get the chance, tell me more...

470
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,739
about how great the outside world is.

471
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:18,511
Aunt 13, if is so great,

472
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:20,596
why'd you come back?

473
00:40:24,017 --> 00:40:26,268
There's something here they haven't got.

474
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:28,104
What haven't they got?

475
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:31,941
People!

476
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,993
People I want to see

477
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:47,373
I was away 2 years,

478
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,208
but my heart was here.

479
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:52,378
In fact you were always in my thoughts

480
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,381
You are very sweet.

481
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:00,386
Aunt 13! - Whas wrong?

482
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:02,638
I thought... No, is nothing!

483
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:05,891
Fei Hung, you and I are relatives by name,

484
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,643
not by blood.

485
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:09,103
We were raised together,

486
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:11,355
don't call me Aunt 13.

487
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,400
Whall I call you? You're senior to me.

488
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:15,985
I'll do it!

489
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:26,328
Whas this? Doesn't matter!

490
00:41:27,164 --> 00:41:28,581
Doesn't matter?

491
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:32,084
Of course it does, one must be precise.

492
00:41:32,335 --> 00:41:34,837
Chinese shouldn't wear suits.

493
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,088
Chinese are Chinese,

494
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,715
Westerners Western.

495
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:41,510
There will be railways
and a telegraph company soon.

496
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:43,012
Everything will change.

497
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:45,973
China will change will the world.

498
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:51,687
You're right.

499
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,857
Western guns and ships are here.

500
00:41:55,108 --> 00:41:56,734
Everything is changing.

501
00:41:57,444 --> 00:41:59,528
Changing. What will we change into?

502
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:03,491
I appreciate your gift, but you keep it.

503
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:06,744
When all Chinese wear suits,

504
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,454
I'll wear one.

505
00:42:36,024 --> 00:42:40,528
Come greet me the God of Fortune!
Here I am, the God of Fortune!

506
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:42,821
Get away! Get away, Jesuit!

507
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,449
Fortune?

508
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:49,286
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune.

509
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:50,704
Come greet the God of Fortune!

510
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:54,250
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune!

511
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:59,129
Did you buy Fortune from me, or the old one?

512
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:03,008
He's now dead in a well. Want to see him?

513
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:05,302
Just buy a new one!

514
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:06,637
If I pay him, what happens

515
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:08,138
when the old God comes?

516
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,225
- Sir, do you need a hand?
- You want to join us!

517
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:14,270
- Yes sir! Life is so tough right now!
- Give me the money.

518
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:16,313
So that we can take care of you.

519
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:17,898
Sir, don't clean me out,

520
00:43:18,149 --> 00:43:19,275
give me a chance.

521
00:43:19,526 --> 00:43:22,111
- And who'll give me a chance?
- Give me of it!

522
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:25,406
Take advantage of people in these hard times?

523
00:43:28,118 --> 00:43:29,451
Is Master Wong!

524
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:31,412
You're from Shaho?

525
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:33,038
Come with me to City Hall.

526
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,248
Protect me!

527
00:43:53,685 --> 00:43:54,810
Stabbing your own people?

528
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:06,822
Get going! Run!

529
00:44:11,703 --> 00:44:12,661
Quick! Get away, quick!

530
00:44:12,912 --> 00:44:14,872
Run! Where've you good-for-nothings gone?

531
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:31,096
Go to hell!

532
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:43,525
Damn, is high!

533
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:52,034
Run

534
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:53,786
Alright! How wonderful!

535
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:55,037
Did you see Master Wong do his

536
00:44:55,288 --> 00:44:56,413
"Shadowless Kick"?

537
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:57,915
Did you see it? - No, I didn't.

538
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:02,544
Everyone, this guy extorts money.

539
00:45:02,796 --> 00:45:04,213
I'm taking him to City Hall.

540
00:45:04,547 --> 00:45:06,465
Please come and be witness.

541
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:10,260
He's impressive,

542
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:12,096
did an amazing jump.

543
00:45:12,347 --> 00:45:14,973
Boss, he wants protection money from you.

544
00:45:15,308 --> 00:45:17,309
Come with me to be a witness.

545
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,936
Witness?

546
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:21,397
And live my days worrying

547
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:22,940
like the Theater boss?

548
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:24,566
You were practising Kung Fu in there,

549
00:45:24,818 --> 00:45:28,153
I saw no fighting.

550
00:45:29,698 --> 00:45:33,325
In America, people have to walk carefully.

551
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:37,913
Because they can trip on gold.

552
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:40,499
How's that possible? - There's more.

553
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,961
Wash your face in the river, you'll find gold.

554
00:45:44,212 --> 00:45:45,254
Is it really so wonderful?

555
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:46,755
Of course it is!

556
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:48,090
Just one visis

557
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:50,926
worth a lifetime of work in China.

558
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:55,639
Come, have some leaflets, one for everyone.

559
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,015
Don't said I didn't inform you

560
00:45:57,267 --> 00:45:59,226
People there wear dark glasses day and night.

561
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:01,103
Your eyes will get hurt

562
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:02,396
You can't pick up gold

563
00:46:02,647 --> 00:46:04,732
if you're blind.

564
00:46:08,278 --> 00:46:12,364
Lost sheep, Goïs Kingdom belongs to you.

565
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:15,701
You're promoting America too?

566
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:17,578
Material things are transient.

567
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:21,290
Only Jesus is the truth.

568
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:24,626
You should follow him and experience life.

569
00:46:25,378 --> 00:46:26,795
I arrested a criminal today,

570
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:29,173
will Jesus be my witness?

571
00:46:55,909 --> 00:47:01,914
Beware of me. Beware of thieves.

572
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,336
Big Brother!

573
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:09,546
- Big Brother, are you over there?
- I'm here!

574
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:14,510
Get ready!

575
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,320
Master! - How are you?

576
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:35,531
You crazy? Fanning when is so windy outside.

577
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,658
City Hall locked up the Local Militia?

578
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:40,369
Won't release them till the suspecs caught.

579
00:47:41,788 --> 00:47:42,746
Master!

580
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:45,999
I can't be a witness

581
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:47,501
because I'm a suspect.

582
00:47:48,586 --> 00:47:50,754
They even let Hung of Shaho go.

583
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:55,717
When will the Local Militia be released?

584
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:58,053
When someone offers to be a witness.

585
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:05,269
Master, how about Foon?

586
00:48:05,895 --> 00:48:08,647
Foon? Do you know him? - Yes.

587
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:11,149
You must be in this.

588
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:12,860
Whas you hiding?

589
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:18,866
I... Master, you don't always trust me.

590
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:20,993
So, I...

591
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:22,786
I what? Speak!

592
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:26,456
Mas... Mas... Master... The... There...

593
00:48:38,678 --> 00:48:40,554
Fire! - Calm down, So. Don't panic!

594
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:42,264
Master!

595
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,975
So!...

596
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,189
Master, what shall we do?

597
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:52,608
The arrows came from the pharmacy's roof.

598
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:54,234
So, Master is coming to save you!

599
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:57,571
Never mind me. Gather... the valuables!

600
00:48:57,947 --> 00:49:02,576
Kai, get your weapon. We'll take them on.

601
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:05,662
Wing, put out the fire. I'm off.

602
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:07,164
Alone?

603
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:18,133
Damn!

604
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:20,052
So! Here!

605
00:49:29,187 --> 00:49:30,687
Goddamn steps!

606
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:36,151
His Excellency's fan? It is!

607
00:49:46,496 --> 00:49:48,580
Wow, the rooftop fire is big!

608
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:50,958
Is... even big... bigger down here!

609
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:58,423
Someone's on the roof. - Shoot him!

610
00:50:06,933 --> 00:50:08,642
Is Master Wong. Go! Run!

611
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:28,370
Po Chi Lam is on fire!

612
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:34,418
Don't forget the camera, hurry up!

613
00:50:38,423 --> 00:50:39,881
Po Chi Lam will be no more if is burnt.

614
00:50:45,054 --> 00:50:46,054
What are you doing, Aunt 13?

615
00:50:46,305 --> 00:50:47,347
Taking a photo of Po Chi Lam.

616
00:50:47,598 --> 00:50:48,932
A photo! Your butt is on fire.

617
00:50:49,183 --> 00:50:50,350
You're blocking the sign.

618
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:54,021
A little more, I can't see you.

619
00:50:54,272 --> 00:50:55,397
Should we wait for Master?

620
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:59,026
The... roof... is... is on fire!

621
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:03,363
So, look this way!

622
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:09,161
Kai, shift a little to the right.

623
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:56,583
I thought I had it with me.

624
00:51:57,293 --> 00:52:00,170
But I was taking pictures of Po Chi Lam.

625
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,382
You're just like a foreign hag...

626
00:52:04,759 --> 00:52:06,510
caring only for trivia.

627
00:52:07,053 --> 00:52:09,137
Don't ever bring this into the Clinic again.

628
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:13,308
Or I'll throw it away.

629
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,323
His Excellency the Governor is here!

630
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:40,585
Wong Fei Hung, you open Schools,

631
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:42,671
triad societies...

632
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:46,758
divide up the town and run illegal business.
You diït obey the law.

633
00:52:47,009 --> 00:52:48,510
Now other triads take revenge...

634
00:52:49,178 --> 00:52:51,805
The burning of Po Chi Lam is your own fault.

635
00:52:52,056 --> 00:52:54,182
Is time to mend your ways!

636
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:58,395
Excellency, Schools are not triad societies.

637
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:00,939
If the authority...

638
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:03,984
labels martial arts illegal,

639
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,028
then our grand tradition...

640
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,365
will be lost.

641
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,325
So when attacked,

642
00:53:13,035 --> 00:53:15,245
how'll we defend ourselves?

643
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:17,664
Is that what you can courting peace?

644
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,791
Can't save your Po Chi Lam...

645
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:22,043
and you dare lecturing me!

646
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,922
Is City Hall's job to investigate the fire.

647
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,216
You tell me, who did it?

648
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:29,926
I don't know.

649
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:32,637
You don't know? You're covering something.

650
00:53:37,727 --> 00:53:38,727
Big Brother!

651
00:53:38,978 --> 00:53:43,690
Wing, what are you doing? Go in!

652
00:53:43,941 --> 00:53:45,317
Master!

653
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,613
Can I come in?

654
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:50,989
Foreigners... why you come here?

655
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,908
Wing! - Master!

656
00:53:54,035 --> 00:53:56,494
Go on like this, and you stop calling me Master.

657
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:57,787
Don't go.

658
00:53:58,164 --> 00:53:59,623
You must hold something against Fei Hung.

659
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:02,417
You can tell me.

660
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:09,341
Wong Fei Hung. I know who set Po Chi Lam on fire.

661
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:12,344
I can be your witness.

662
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:14,471
Check if anyone's from Shaho.

663
00:54:15,681 --> 00:54:17,307
Hey, are you from Shaho. - No!

664
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:18,808
Not the way you talk.

665
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,062
There's so many people here!

666
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,191
Big Brother, seems City Hall may get you.

667
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:29,194
Goddamn! That Jesuit musve told on me.

668
00:54:29,487 --> 00:54:31,404
Should you go and hide in Shaho?

669
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:33,531
No way!

670
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:35,951
We're afraid of City Hall,
they're afraid of the foreigners.

671
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:38,119
So les find us an influential foreigners!

672
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:42,123
Wait for me.

673
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:46,711
We want to speak to Mr. Jackson.

674
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:48,755
Do you understand what I'm saying?

675
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:51,132
Whas going on down there?

676
00:54:51,384 --> 00:54:53,510
Damn, we don't speak English. Try harder.

677
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:57,722
Please,

678
00:54:57,974 --> 00:55:00,225
please let us in to see Mr. Jackson.

679
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:02,435
We all want to see Mr. Jackson.

680
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:07,023
Jackson...

681
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:10,068
I'd better have a cigar

682
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,612
I don't like cigars.

683
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:20,120
If I keep a dog, ill guard my house.

684
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:22,247
You are wanted by City Hall.

685
00:55:22,498 --> 00:55:24,708
What good is it if I help you?

686
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,960
I'm not afraid of being arrested.

687
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,005
But I am afraid that without a leader,

688
00:55:30,256 --> 00:55:32,674
my brothers' talent will go to waste.

689
00:55:32,925 --> 00:55:35,552
You come all this way to make money,

690
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,346
send so many Chinese to America.

691
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,474
Why don't I give you some women to ship over?

692
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:42,726
Isn't it a better idea?

693
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:44,519
No, we don't allow

694
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:45,729
the labourers to have wives.

695
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,314
Don't allow them to have descendents.

696
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:49,566
Otherwise they'd stay there forever.

697
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:53,653
I don't mean wives, but whores.

698
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:55,655
I have as many as you want.

699
00:55:55,906 --> 00:55:57,324
Is Master Wong,

700
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:59,784
who always interferes.

701
00:56:00,578 --> 00:56:02,871
Dare you kill him for me?

702
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:19,346
Master Wong? - Yes...

703
00:56:19,597 --> 00:56:21,431
- I'll invite him to the show tomorrow.
- Yes, yes, yes!

704
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:24,017
Then he'll be killed by me...

705
00:56:24,268 --> 00:56:26,853
or the authorities.

706
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:51,795
Do you hear noise?

707
00:56:55,591 --> 00:56:57,509
Something just dropped into the water.

708
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:21,533
Wing, City Hall's after the Shaho Gang.

709
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:23,660
Foon, where were you?

710
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:26,079
I've to go back to the Theater. Come with me.

711
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,997
Wait, let me lock up first.

712
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:30,333
OK!

713
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:33,711
Hey, come out first. - Oh right!

714
00:57:42,805 --> 00:57:44,222
This is Wing,

715
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:45,682
the one who can Sove of any problems.

716
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,934
Master Wong's disciple. Welcome!

717
00:57:48,394 --> 00:57:50,145
I won't see the show for free. I'll check tickets.

718
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:51,563
I like gate duty.

719
00:57:51,814 --> 00:57:53,940
- Thank you indeed.
- Never mind, never mind.

720
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,970
Ticket. Have you got tickets?

721
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,973
Those with tickets, get in.

722
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:29,684
Do you have tickets?

723
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:31,686
Ticket?

724
00:58:31,937 --> 00:58:33,855
Do you know who I am? Look at the sign.

725
00:58:34,106 --> 00:58:38,193
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.

726
00:58:38,444 --> 00:58:40,278
And I'm Wing! No ticket, go!

727
00:58:40,529 --> 00:58:43,531
The show's starting and you tell us to leave?

728
00:58:43,782 --> 00:58:46,993
- OK, we'll go, just don't regret it!
- We'll go! We'll go!

729
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:49,996
Got tickets?

730
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:51,372
Brother Wing, les go in.

731
00:58:51,624 --> 00:58:52,790
No hurry, the actors aren't there yet.

732
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:54,542
Thank you so much.

733
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:58,296
Have you seen Wonder Ho and White Gent?

734
00:58:58,547 --> 00:58:59,964
They tried to barge in,

735
00:59:00,216 --> 00:59:01,216
I turned them away.

736
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:03,134
What? They're the actors.

737
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:05,094
Who will act then?

738
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:06,846
Then we don't have a show.

739
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,097
You stay here.

740
00:59:08,098 --> 00:59:11,059
I'll go and fetch them. - Tickets...

741
00:59:17,233 --> 00:59:18,942
Master has come, you help me.

742
00:59:19,193 --> 00:59:20,276
I've to go to toilet.

743
00:59:20,528 --> 00:59:22,278
Excuse me.

744
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,280
Mr. Jackson, let me introduce you to
the Reverend Father.

745
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:25,532
Please to meet you, sir.

746
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,283
General Wickens, please take a seat.

747
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:30,453
Can't imagine you'd be invited by the foreigners.

748
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:32,205
Please!

749
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,381
Aunt 13! - Master Wong!

750
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,677
Why so detached?

751
00:59:46,136 --> 00:59:47,470
Relatives must respect

752
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:49,556
the rule of seniority.

753
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:52,267
Alright, les just watch the show!

754
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,438
Please!...

755
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:03,861
Wing, we're in trouble.

756
01:00:04,113 --> 01:00:05,321
Master's hre. I don't want to watch the show.

757
01:00:05,573 --> 01:00:07,824
The actors are gone. You're going.

758
01:00:08,075 --> 01:00:09,158
Whall I do?

759
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,411
I can sing. - So what?

760
01:00:11,662 --> 01:00:13,454
I can act a little. Les go!

761
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:16,291
You dare sing on stage...

762
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:18,876
in front of Master?

763
01:00:19,169 --> 01:00:21,337
Fool, who will recognize us with make up on?

764
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:24,215
OK, les take a chance. Come backstage.

765
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,051
Lucky you get us

766
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:28,011
or the show'd be cancelled.

767
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:29,220
Amazing that you could recognize me...

768
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:30,680
Isn't that Porky?

769
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:33,808
Who's Wing? Les go. - Go.

770
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:35,935
The White Snake is now a Fat Snake.

771
01:00:52,995 --> 01:00:56,289
Porky! Porky!

772
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:01,628
Hey, Porky's changed profession.

773
01:01:02,254 --> 01:01:03,880
Hey, where'll we get our pork from now?

774
01:01:05,341 --> 01:01:06,591
Wing, again!

775
01:01:18,395 --> 01:01:19,520
Nonsense!

776
01:01:19,772 --> 01:01:20,813
I got him to do it,

777
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:22,190
don't blame him.

778
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:23,733
Pack up and

779
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,777
never come back.

780
01:01:27,196 --> 01:01:29,739
Alright, Brother Wing,
I'll join you in the pork business.

781
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:48,883
Watch out!

782
01:01:58,769 --> 01:01:59,852
Stoop down!

783
01:02:05,901 --> 01:02:07,193
Seal all passageways!

784
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:10,321
Lead the foreigners out.

785
01:02:10,572 --> 01:02:11,739
Yes!

786
01:02:12,116 --> 01:02:13,491
Is fighting outside.

787
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,497
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.

788
01:02:19,748 --> 01:02:21,332
Go after them!

789
01:02:23,252 --> 01:02:24,502
Aunt 13!

790
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:32,719
Stop it!

791
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:38,433
The Troops. - Yes, sir.

792
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:39,767
Get ready.

793
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,061
Don't shoot at the audience.

794
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:43,813
Gun shot! My god! - Don't shoot.

795
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:45,440
No!

796
01:03:17,055 --> 01:03:20,433
Son...

797
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,940
You fool.

798
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:35,156
Shoot him.

799
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:37,533
No!

800
01:03:40,037 --> 01:03:42,413
Limestone powder. Close your eyes.

801
01:03:46,043 --> 01:03:47,543
My eyes...

802
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,588
Don't get up.

803
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:05,812
- Master Wong?
- Don't care about him, les go.

804
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:10,233
Protect His Excellency!

805
01:04:22,788 --> 01:04:24,038
Come on!

806
01:04:24,289 --> 01:04:28,334
Gun!

807
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:31,504
Hide away.

808
01:04:35,092 --> 01:04:39,136
Aunt 13, take the gun and hide with the reverend.

809
01:04:39,471 --> 01:04:42,682
They came for me. Don't stay here!

810
01:04:55,737 --> 01:04:57,530
Reverend Father!

811
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,191
Master, take the pole!

812
01:05:55,505 --> 01:05:57,965
Master, I'll help you!

813
01:06:03,138 --> 01:06:04,263
The floor's too thin.

814
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:09,560
Master, I'll help you! - Who are you?

815
01:06:10,729 --> 01:06:12,438
Help Aunt 13, I don't need help.

816
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:42,093
Leave her alone.

817
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:57,775
Tiger, use your gun. You idiot, shoot him dead.

818
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,406
Shoot them.

819
01:07:10,038 --> 01:07:11,330
No.

820
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,834
Reverend Father.

821
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:17,628
Go.

822
01:07:19,464 --> 01:07:22,717
Father... - Reverend Father.

823
01:07:23,802 --> 01:07:25,928
Wing, come and protect Aunt 13.

824
01:07:31,309 --> 01:07:33,019
They've gone backstage!

825
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,749
Come up here.

826
01:07:58,503 --> 01:07:59,503
Damn it.

827
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,977
Why ambush me?

828
01:08:14,978 --> 01:08:16,520
Is you who ambushed me?

829
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:18,647
Foon? - He's Foon?

830
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,941
Is dangerous here, there're killers inside.

831
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:24,278
Question him, I'm going to have a look.

832
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:26,572
Foon, whare you doing?

833
01:08:26,823 --> 01:08:27,823
How would I know?

834
01:08:27,824 --> 01:08:28,991
He's been hitting me ever

835
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:30,201
since he came in.

836
01:08:30,452 --> 01:08:32,286
Foon! - Don't move!

837
01:08:33,622 --> 01:08:35,081
You say don't move, but you still hit me?

838
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:37,333
Les sort this out before hitting anyone.

839
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,585
Run, run!

840
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:47,051
Master Wong, don't move!

841
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:51,347
Your Excellency. - You shut up!

842
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,891
Excellency, they left something.

843
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:59,605
What? "Glory to Local Militia.
End to foreigners"?

844
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:01,607
Weren't all the...

845
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:03,025
Local Militia arrested?

846
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:08,781
How many have you given shelter to?

847
01:09:10,033 --> 01:09:12,660
Your Excellency. I've been set up.

848
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,370
Don't believe him.

849
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:15,913
Arrest these Shaho thugs.

850
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:17,164
What Shaho thugs?

851
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,876
Thas the second time you've hit me.

852
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,045
Find out the truth before you lay blame.

853
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:24,672
The truth?

854
01:09:28,677 --> 01:09:30,261
He's taking protection money.

855
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:31,804
What? My Master takes protection money?

856
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:33,430
Yes! Is him!

857
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:37,184
Master Wong, isn't he from Shaho?

858
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:39,145
Whas Shaho? The Yellow River?

859
01:09:42,357 --> 01:09:44,108
You don't need to explain.

860
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:46,235
City Hall will soon arrest...

861
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:48,779
your other members.

862
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:51,240
Is time to arrest the head first.

863
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:52,908
I'm going to arrest you first...

864
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,285
and close your Po Chi Lam.

865
01:09:54,536 --> 01:09:56,412
How'll you make trouble now?

866
01:09:57,455 --> 01:09:58,455
A lot of people were hurt at the theater,

867
01:09:58,707 --> 01:09:59,874
let me tend to them,

868
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,167
then I'll go with you.

869
01:10:03,545 --> 01:10:05,254
Alright, go ahead.

870
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:07,173
You'll be guarded.

871
01:10:07,924 --> 01:10:09,175
If anything happens...

872
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:12,011
I'll arrest and execute you right here.

873
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:17,349
Don't move. You're bleeding.

874
01:10:20,312 --> 01:10:21,812
So, fetch the medicine. - Ok!

875
01:10:25,317 --> 01:10:27,151
Go away. Can't you see the eviction notice?

876
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:36,035
That doesn't give you permission to steal.

877
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:37,494
Bring them back!

878
01:10:38,663 --> 01:10:39,705
You dare hit us? - Go away!

879
01:10:39,956 --> 01:10:43,250
Don't you have anything better to do?

880
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:44,752
Master, they are stealing,

881
01:10:45,003 --> 01:10:46,420
I'm stopping them.

882
01:10:46,796 --> 01:10:48,881
So what? Wanna fight?

883
01:10:49,132 --> 01:10:50,299
I'll fight with you.

884
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,008
OK, les go!

885
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:53,302
No! I mean I'll fight you!

886
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:55,512
Master, I fight you?

887
01:10:55,764 --> 01:10:56,889
Where's you like hitting?

888
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,183
Is it here? Here?

889
01:11:01,978 --> 01:11:03,854
You want me arrested sooner?

890
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:08,192
- If not, don't block me saving people.
- Master!

891
01:11:08,443 --> 01:11:10,486
You're so manipulative. You used us.

892
01:11:12,072 --> 01:11:14,782
We'll arrest you, if you stand in our way.

893
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:18,661
He's smart,

894
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:20,579
escapes arrest this way.

895
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:33,425
Come hit me? So restrained!

896
01:11:53,196 --> 01:11:55,072
Mr. Cheng!

897
01:11:56,074 --> 01:11:58,117
Still bleeding. Fetch me the "Last Aid"!

898
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:01,829
"Last Aid"!

899
01:12:18,722 --> 01:12:22,182
He's dead. Tell his family.

900
01:12:32,485 --> 01:12:33,694
So...

901
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:51,462
Fei Hung!

902
01:12:53,381 --> 01:12:54,673
Whas the tattoo?

903
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:58,177
Is Arabic numerals. "JACKSON"

904
01:12:58,595 --> 01:13:01,055
Is it his ship's name?

905
01:13:03,516 --> 01:13:06,143
Don't worry. I'm Wong Fei Hung.

906
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,062
You're hurt. If you move,

907
01:13:08,313 --> 01:13:09,480
you'll tear the wound.

908
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:15,611
You're Master Wong? Help me!

909
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:19,948
Get up. Where're you from?

910
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,994
America! - America?

911
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:28,332
We crossed seas;

912
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:31,543
denied medicine when ill.

913
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,214
Many were thrown overboard.

914
01:13:37,425 --> 01:13:39,093
In America,

915
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:43,555
we were branded like pigs.

916
01:13:44,224 --> 01:13:47,476
We were cheated...

917
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:49,937
by the Chinese dealers here.

918
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:52,898
We signed contracts, paid for food and the trip.

919
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:55,192
Paid for so many things.

920
01:13:56,194 --> 01:14:00,489
Those who tried to escape were caught and killed.

921
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:04,159
I came back to China.

922
01:14:04,411 --> 01:14:09,456
I... I... Master Wong...

923
01:14:09,707 --> 01:14:13,585
Don't worry, you're back in China now.

924
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,004
Let me see if

925
01:14:16,256 --> 01:14:17,589
I can find your family.

926
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:20,676
Don't think too much.

927
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:26,723
Kai! Keep secret his contract
with the foreigners.

928
01:14:27,392 --> 01:14:29,393
Or City Hall will arrest him.

929
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:31,270
I understand.

930
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,649
Going to America's better than

931
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,318
staying here.

932
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:46,201
Don't miss out! Come... Take a look!
You want one?

933
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:49,121
Giong to America? How? Take one.

934
01:14:49,372 --> 01:14:51,165
You want one, too?

935
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:54,960
The same America as in the newspaper?

936
01:14:55,211 --> 01:14:57,504
Right! If you want to go, pay an exit tax...

937
01:14:57,755 --> 01:14:59,423
pay your passage, rental, blanket and food.

938
01:14:59,674 --> 01:15:02,134
Get a 3 year contract.

939
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:03,427
You mean it costs 2 years salary?

940
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:05,095
Haven't you got money? - No, I haven't.

941
01:15:05,346 --> 01:15:06,638
Then don't even think about it.

942
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:08,223
Shove off!

943
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:12,644
You want one, is full of gold there.

944
01:15:12,896 --> 01:15:14,313
Someone's fighting there!

945
01:15:14,564 --> 01:15:18,525
Duel? Les go and watch it. Go, go.

946
01:15:19,486 --> 01:15:20,611
Don't go, don't go!

947
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:26,408
You dare show off...

948
01:15:26,659 --> 01:15:28,744
in front of my house...

949
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:31,497
and hit my disciple.

950
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:33,290
Whas your name?

951
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,125
Master Yim.

952
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:06,740
I'm matchless in 19 provinces with my "7 Sabres".

953
01:16:07,033 --> 01:16:10,744
You're a guest, so I'll let you thrust 3 times.

954
01:16:13,414 --> 01:16:14,581
Then prepare!

955
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:36,937
No. 2!

956
01:17:03,798 --> 01:17:06,508
Still No.2 and you already draw your sword?

957
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:11,430
You will get killed. Les forget it!

958
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:13,724
Don't go.

959
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:44,713
Hit me in the back?

960
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,532
"Iron Vest Kung Fu"!

961
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:20,123
I've let you thrust 3 times. Admit defeat!

962
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,667
There must be a way to beat him.

963
01:19:42,498 --> 01:19:43,498
What are you following me for?

964
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,208
My name is Foon. I'm from May County.

965
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:47,294
There're lots of gangs in this town.

966
01:19:47,754 --> 01:19:48,879
My Kung Fu is poor.

967
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:50,255
I'm often harassed.

968
01:19:50,506 --> 01:19:53,759
Can't even make a living.

969
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,429
Please take me as your disciple.

970
01:19:59,265 --> 01:20:03,101
Whas the point of being a Kung Fu expert?

971
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:05,312
Can't make a living.

972
01:20:21,871 --> 01:20:24,915
Master, are you hungry?

973
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,083
You take shelter.

974
01:20:27,585 --> 01:20:29,002
I'll think of something.

975
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:34,674
Good! - Give me a drumstick!

976
01:20:34,926 --> 01:20:44,226
Good food, we don't eat bad food.

977
01:20:48,397 --> 01:20:50,899
Gentlemen, come inside!

978
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,112
The soup's salty. Don't drink it. Les go!

979
01:21:00,284 --> 01:21:04,079
Today's soup's very salty.

980
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:10,001
Hey, why'd you steal my bowl?

981
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:14,256
Gentlemen, welcome, come and have a drink.

982
01:21:14,507 --> 01:21:17,092
Welcome gentlemen, let me sing to you.

983
01:21:17,343 --> 01:21:19,010
Master, have some soup.

984
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,946
2 men drink from the same bowl. Pathetic!

985
01:21:39,156 --> 01:21:41,741
Madam, shall I have them thrown out?

986
01:21:45,705 --> 01:21:47,539
If I made it here,

987
01:21:47,832 --> 01:21:50,208
who'd dare belittle me?

988
01:21:50,793 --> 01:21:52,711
Right, got to be the top.

989
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:55,005
Who's the best in town?

990
01:21:55,339 --> 01:21:56,882
Master Wong?

991
01:22:40,009 --> 01:22:41,176
Fei Hung!

992
01:22:41,427 --> 01:22:47,515
Aunt 13, you're right. China must change.

993
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,185
Fists can't fight guns.

994
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:53,396
I'm under house arrest,

995
01:22:54,148 --> 01:22:55,732
soon I'll have to fight.

996
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:57,317
Take care!

997
01:22:57,568 --> 01:23:00,070
Fei Hung, I'll wait for you.

998
01:23:00,905 --> 01:23:02,197
You don't have to.

999
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:04,866
If you do,

1000
01:23:05,284 --> 01:23:07,494
I won't die in peace.

1001
01:23:10,206 --> 01:23:11,957
You won't die...

1002
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:20,173
I'm only mortal... Go home!

1003
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:24,552
Wing, he...

1004
01:23:33,104 --> 01:23:35,605
Wing, go inside, is raining hard.

1005
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:38,024
Master didn't tell me to, so I daren't.

1006
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:39,567
Wing!

1007
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:45,949
Go back to Po Chi Lam. - Master!

1008
01:23:47,493 --> 01:23:49,035
Come, go in!

1009
01:23:52,415 --> 01:23:58,420
I... Master, let me do it!

1010
01:24:20,151 --> 01:24:21,526
So!

1011
01:24:58,773 --> 01:25:00,148
Is raining harder.

1012
01:25:02,234 --> 01:25:03,818
This is closed, go!

1013
01:25:16,582 --> 01:25:19,209
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim from Shandong...

1014
01:25:19,668 --> 01:25:21,503
I'm here to...

1015
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:26,049

1016
01:25:27,718 --> 01:25:29,719
Please tell me who Master Wong is?

1017
01:25:33,891 --> 01:25:36,434
Master, a challenger! - Wing, pour tea!

1018
01:25:36,685 --> 01:25:39,187
Master! - Pour tea!

1019
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:42,107
Please!

1020
01:25:42,483 --> 01:25:45,610
Kai, take the patients to one side.

1021
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:52,659
Have a seat!

1022
01:25:56,705 --> 01:25:58,081
Why not fold the umbrella now you're inside?

1023
01:26:05,673 --> 01:26:07,215
Have some tea!

1024
01:26:09,343 --> 01:26:11,094
Foon, whare you doing?

1025
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,179
Foon?

1026
01:26:18,227 --> 01:26:20,895
Master Wong, your techniques are famous,

1027
01:26:21,313 --> 01:26:22,272
especially your...

1028
01:26:22,523 --> 01:26:24,649
"Shadowless Kick" and "Ten Forms Fist".

1029
01:26:24,942 --> 01:26:28,319
I intend to open up my own school,

1030
01:26:28,571 --> 01:26:29,988
thus I'm here to challenge you.

1031
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,365
So people will know...

1032
01:26:32,616 --> 01:26:34,826

1033
01:26:35,077 --> 01:26:36,452
I'm under house arrest,

1034
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:38,746
you could get in trouble.

1035
01:26:39,248 --> 01:26:42,417
I can't fight you today.

1036
01:26:42,751 --> 01:26:44,502
Be a man. Don't be a coward.

1037
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:46,963
Master Yim!

1038
01:26:50,384 --> 01:26:52,886
I've patients here, so is not ideal for combat.

1039
01:26:53,137 --> 01:26:55,221
Wing, Kai!

1040
01:26:55,472 --> 01:26:57,140
Want to be thrown out again?

1041
01:27:24,793 --> 01:27:26,211
- Whare you standing around for?
- Master.

1042
01:27:26,462 --> 01:27:28,171
Take the patients to the back.

1043
01:27:29,465 --> 01:27:31,257
I'll take you inside. They're going to fight.

1044
01:27:31,508 --> 01:27:33,676
Why do you bother my patients?

1045
01:27:33,928 --> 01:27:35,762
Move him or he'll get hurt by my master.

1046
01:27:36,013 --> 01:27:38,264
Bull! If not for my Master, I'd beat you up.

1047
01:27:38,515 --> 01:27:41,809
Let go! - No!

1048
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:45,313
Goddamn, Foon! - What?

1049
01:27:45,564 --> 01:27:46,731
You dare try again?

1050
01:29:08,314 --> 01:29:11,107
Yim, stop fighting.

1051
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:17,322
If you go on, I'll fire!

1052
01:29:17,865 --> 01:29:21,451
Don't hurt my Master. Give me!

1053
01:29:33,797 --> 01:29:35,882
Master, are you alright?

1054
01:29:55,986 --> 01:29:59,238
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim. I don't fear guns.

1055
01:30:00,032 --> 01:30:01,783
Wong Fei Hung, I won too easily,

1056
01:30:02,034 --> 01:30:03,117
it doesn't count.

1057
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:04,243
Les have a duel tomorrow in the street.

1058
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:06,329
If you don't come,

1059
01:30:06,663 --> 01:30:09,832
I'll assume victory, Foon!

1060
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:13,044
You jerk!

1061
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,104
You ungrateful shit!

1062
01:30:38,904 --> 01:30:43,366
- Stupid! Stupid!
- Speak Chinese, you infidel.

1063
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:54,335
Are you OK? - Yes, I just slipped!

1064
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,962
The guards are hurt,

1065
01:30:56,213 --> 01:30:57,422
there'll be trouble.

1066
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,799
City Hall will be here soon. Wing, Kai...

1067
01:31:00,384 --> 01:31:02,552
go inside, get some money and go.

1068
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:06,431
Aunt 13, go and wake the man from America.

1069
01:31:06,849 --> 01:31:09,559
Whare you standing around for? Get away.

1070
01:31:10,102 --> 01:31:11,436
Take the man with you.

1071
01:31:12,855 --> 01:31:16,065
So, you don't know Kung Fu, you're defenseless.

1072
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:21,696
Don't wait for them. Go now. - Mas...

1073
01:31:22,698 --> 01:31:25,283
Take care! - I'll see you off!

1074
01:31:42,259 --> 01:31:45,136
Don't act recklessly.

1075
01:31:45,429 --> 01:31:47,513
Master! - Don't act rashly.

1076
01:31:47,764 --> 01:31:49,682
Don't worry, your word is my command.

1077
01:31:50,517 --> 01:31:52,560
Kai, tell Aunt 13
to take the man leave immediately.

1078
01:31:53,812 --> 01:31:54,854
I release them...

1079
01:31:54,855 --> 01:31:57,190
in order to get the whole gang. Search!

1080
01:31:57,774 --> 01:32:01,194
Wait! I have many invalid patients here...

1081
01:32:01,445 --> 01:32:02,904
They couldn't leave and
thas why they stayed here.

1082
01:32:03,155 --> 01:32:04,322
Please don't disturb them.

1083
01:32:04,573 --> 01:32:05,907
Otherwise they'll become more seriously hurt.

1084
01:32:06,533 --> 01:32:08,159
You asked me not to go inside?

1085
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,036
So there must be something inside.

1086
01:32:10,496 --> 01:32:12,747
But I intend to catch you off guard...

1087
01:32:12,998 --> 01:32:17,335
to see who might be hiding
with your patients. Search!

1088
01:32:17,586 --> 01:32:19,045
Yes!

1089
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:25,384
Someone's stealing away! - Chase them!

1090
01:32:27,471 --> 01:32:29,430
Go.

1091
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:33,059
So, go quick!

1092
01:32:35,229 --> 01:32:37,021
Get them! - Yes!

1093
01:32:38,023 --> 01:32:39,857
Wing, do it!

1094
01:32:40,108 --> 01:32:41,234
What? Master?

1095
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,906
Wing, I told you to do it!

1096
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:50,618
Manchurian Dog! - You insult me?

1097
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:53,079
Samson's Lift!

1098
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:58,167
Can we really fight? - Yes!

1099
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:09,303
Where's my gun?

1100
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:28,948
Where're you going? Come back. Shadowless Kick.

1101
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,783
Go after them! - Yes!

1102
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:38,916
Don't bother.

1103
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,751
The man you want is here.

1104
01:33:41,503 --> 01:33:43,296
Divide up. - Yes!

1105
01:33:46,383 --> 01:33:47,633
This way.

1106
01:33:49,136 --> 01:33:50,928
Hold the pole, the rest go under.

1107
01:34:16,496 --> 01:34:17,371
Wong Fei Hung,

1108
01:34:17,372 --> 01:34:20,291
I arrest you on charges of treason!

1109
01:34:22,210 --> 01:34:25,171
Your Excellency, I'll go with you.

1110
01:34:25,756 --> 01:34:28,382
Kai! - Master!

1111
01:34:28,634 --> 01:34:29,842
Kai, fetch medicine

1112
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:32,094
for the wounded.

1113
01:34:33,138 --> 01:34:36,307
Medicine from Po Chi Lam is the best.

1114
01:34:36,725 --> 01:34:38,392
How many are you?

1115
01:34:39,227 --> 01:34:43,064
- Are you alright, Your Excellency?
- You good-for-nothing!

1116
01:34:45,275 --> 01:34:47,568
We're about there. Hang on!

1117
01:34:48,278 --> 01:34:50,905
Now we've got guns, we've got power.

1118
01:34:51,156 --> 01:34:53,074
We have to find women for the foreigners.

1119
01:34:54,618 --> 01:34:56,160
Sha... Shaho Gang!

1120
01:34:56,787 --> 01:34:59,205
Hurry up, go that way.

1121
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,708
Woman!

1122
01:35:07,089 --> 01:35:08,464
Let go of So!

1123
01:35:15,055 --> 01:35:16,639
You get away!

1124
01:35:18,475 --> 01:35:19,558
Don't let her go!

1125
01:35:25,524 --> 01:35:26,691
Let go!

1126
01:35:26,942 --> 01:35:28,234
Sir, take care of yourself.

1127
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:31,487
Run! They're many. Don't stay for me.

1128
01:35:45,627 --> 01:35:46,669
Go to hell!

1129
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:48,879
Go!

1130
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:52,967
Let me go! - Go!

1131
01:35:57,723 --> 01:35:59,473
There's one over there. Get him!

1132
01:35:59,725 --> 01:36:01,809
Get him! Don't go.

1133
01:36:03,145 --> 01:36:04,520
Damn you

1134
01:36:04,813 --> 01:36:06,480
come to help me now?

1135
01:36:10,152 --> 01:36:15,364
Punching Po Chi Lam Kicking Wong Fei Hung?

1136
01:36:15,615 --> 01:36:18,117
Challenging Master Wong!

1137
01:36:18,827 --> 01:36:22,538
Yes, we're not going home. Les wait here!

1138
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,334
When do you think Master Wong will be here?

1139
01:36:48,565 --> 01:36:50,649
Open your mouth wide.

1140
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,490
Open the door!

1141
01:37:01,286 --> 01:37:02,536
Go away!

1142
01:37:09,461 --> 01:37:12,630
You dare shoot me? You'll be shipped tonight!

1143
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:14,298
Do you hate me?

1144
01:37:14,549 --> 01:37:15,800
I want to taste your fresh

1145
01:37:16,051 --> 01:37:18,761
Will your skin need spicing up?

1146
01:37:23,141 --> 01:37:27,144
When you have to serve those stinking labourers,

1147
01:37:27,479 --> 01:37:30,773
you're gonna remember me. Take her to my room!

1148
01:37:31,024 --> 01:37:32,107
Yes!

1149
01:37:33,318 --> 01:37:36,028
Big Brother, the one who beat Wong is here.

1150
01:37:36,738 --> 01:37:38,989
Great!

1151
01:37:39,282 --> 01:37:41,784
Good, now Fa Shan will be ours.

1152
01:37:46,373 --> 01:37:47,998
Master!

1153
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,251
You know each other?
Foon is now your Big Brother.

1154
01:37:50,502 --> 01:37:51,877
Confide in him.

1155
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,631
He's the Big Brother? Call him Big Brother.

1156
01:37:55,882 --> 01:37:58,133
Big Brother!

1157
01:37:59,845 --> 01:38:01,470
OK...

1158
01:38:01,721 --> 01:38:04,014
Remember he's Big Brother.

1159
01:38:04,266 --> 01:38:05,391
Master, I'm busy tonight.

1160
01:38:05,642 --> 01:38:07,560
Please excuse me!

1161
01:38:07,811 --> 01:38:10,145
We'll talk about the new School tomorrow.

1162
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:13,190
Get the present for Master ready.

1163
01:38:17,904 --> 01:38:18,863
Master Yim,

1164
01:38:19,114 --> 01:38:21,866
this is for you to open a School.

1165
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:25,369
The Yim's Fist Style will conquer Fu Shan.

1166
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:28,455
Come... les toast Master Yim!

1167
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,500
Cheers, Master!

1168
01:39:32,812 --> 01:39:34,313
Don't move! What do you want?

1169
01:39:35,565 --> 01:39:36,690
Master Wong,

1170
01:39:37,192 --> 01:39:40,444
we all admire you.

1171
01:39:40,737 --> 01:39:42,446
We know you've been set up.

1172
01:39:43,615 --> 01:39:45,950
Master Wong, we've decided to free you...

1173
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:48,953
and we'll take responsibility for it.

1174
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:51,789
Master Wong, this way!

1175
01:39:52,499 --> 01:39:54,291
Great! Les go, Master!

1176
01:39:57,587 --> 01:39:58,754
Master!

1177
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:03,425
There're laws in China,
I won't make a mockery of them.

1178
01:40:03,677 --> 01:40:06,553
Go! Master! - Go with Master!

1179
01:40:07,472 --> 01:40:11,100
No, Excellency. I appreciate it, but I won't go.

1180
01:40:11,351 --> 01:40:14,395
Wong... - Master Wong is over there.

1181
01:40:15,105 --> 01:40:18,232
Mas... Master!

1182
01:40:18,483 --> 01:40:19,608
Master, you're still here?

1183
01:40:20,527 --> 01:40:24,113
So! - Master... Mas... Mas...

1184
01:40:24,698 --> 01:40:25,739
Speak slowly.

1185
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,282
Master... Aunt 13 and I took that man,

1186
01:40:27,534 --> 01:40:28,701
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.

1187
01:40:28,952 --> 01:40:30,285
They killed him

1188
01:40:30,537 --> 01:40:31,620
and captured Aunt 13.

1189
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:33,706
Think of something to save her. - What?

1190
01:40:35,166 --> 01:40:36,500
Master Wong, les go and save her.

1191
01:40:40,213 --> 01:40:41,964
Wing, I'll give you a few men.

1192
01:40:42,215 --> 01:40:43,007
Good!

1193
01:40:43,008 --> 01:40:44,425
Let them go! - Yes!

1194
01:40:45,176 --> 01:40:47,177
Buck Teeth So, how come you spoke so fast?

1195
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:50,347
I was... rehearsing all the way.

1196
01:41:00,025 --> 01:41:03,277
I'm sure you'll miss the
Chinese food when you return.

1197
01:41:07,115 --> 01:41:08,741
Isn't that Master Wong?

1198
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:15,706
Aren't they the Local Militia?

1199
01:41:37,437 --> 01:41:39,146
Master, you're great.

1200
01:41:39,397 --> 01:41:40,939
You even beat Wong Fei Hung.

1201
01:41:41,191 --> 01:41:44,902
Give us a little demo.

1202
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,404
Just a little? Just a little?

1203
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,386
OK!

1204
01:42:44,254 --> 01:42:46,964
Bitch! The hell with you!

1205
01:43:36,806 --> 01:43:38,765
Thast enough, Master, enough!

1206
01:43:46,107 --> 01:43:47,691
Master, thas enough!

1207
01:43:49,027 --> 01:43:50,277
Whas wrong?

1208
01:43:50,945 --> 01:43:52,571
This money is dirty.

1209
01:43:52,822 --> 01:43:53,989
Don't accept it.

1210
01:43:54,365 --> 01:43:55,365
What? You insulting us?

1211
01:43:55,617 --> 01:43:56,658
What are you doing?

1212
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:57,951
What do you mean?

1213
01:43:58,203 --> 01:43:59,161
You looking down on us?

1214
01:43:59,537 --> 01:44:04,499
Nothing in this world is perfect...

1215
01:44:05,627 --> 01:44:08,754
Virture is often found among the lowly...

1216
01:44:09,839 --> 01:44:13,175
Our priority is to make our name in Fa Shan.

1217
01:44:13,635 --> 01:44:16,136
When thas achieved,

1218
01:44:16,387 --> 01:44:18,263
we can talk justice.

1219
01:44:19,265 --> 01:44:23,936
Thas life. Foon, pick up the money!

1220
01:44:40,787 --> 01:44:43,664
Pick up the money! Pick up the money!

1221
01:44:46,042 --> 01:45:17,197
Pick up the money!

1222
01:45:17,573 --> 01:45:18,657
You think you're a Big Brother?

1223
01:45:18,908 --> 01:45:20,242
I think you're a nobody!

1224
01:45:20,493 --> 01:45:22,035
Foon!

1225
01:45:24,247 --> 01:45:43,640
Pick up the money!

1226
01:45:44,434 --> 01:45:48,645
Make our name in Fa Shan? Thas life!

1227
01:46:17,467 --> 01:46:20,761
Big Brother!...

1228
01:46:21,012 --> 01:46:22,262
Bastard!

1229
01:46:27,727 --> 01:46:29,102
Damn you!

1230
01:46:37,236 --> 01:46:42,115
Aunt 13, wake up!

1231
01:46:43,201 --> 01:46:44,159
Bastard, don't touch me!

1232
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:46,119
Don't scream, I've come to help you.

1233
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:57,214
Foon, is it you? So many people are coming!

1234
01:46:57,465 --> 01:46:59,216
Make off, I'll cover you. Quickly, go!

1235
01:47:14,357 --> 01:47:15,649
Get that woman!

1236
01:47:29,789 --> 01:47:31,706
Foon, stop or...

1237
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,793
I'll kill this woman.

1238
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:41,466
Our Big Brother? Go to hell!

1239
01:47:41,717 --> 01:47:43,635
Hit me? Damn you!

1240
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:45,887
Master, they are inside. - Les go in!

1241
01:47:46,514 --> 01:47:47,639
Whas going on?

1242
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:50,016
Master, Foon in no time at all...

1243
01:47:50,393 --> 01:47:52,144
tried to force himself...

1244
01:47:52,395 --> 01:47:53,437
on my life.

1245
01:47:53,688 --> 01:47:56,231
No, is not true... - Shut up!

1246
01:48:01,487 --> 01:48:05,157
Foon, you scum, apologize to your brother.

1247
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:08,785
Yim, we met at Po Chi Lam.

1248
01:48:09,036 --> 01:48:11,496
Shut up, you bitch! Go!

1249
01:48:13,624 --> 01:48:15,041
You want rebel?

1250
01:48:16,627 --> 01:48:19,212
Stupid, she's not his wife.

1251
01:48:19,464 --> 01:48:20,464
Stupid.

1252
01:48:20,715 --> 01:48:25,093
- She's related to Wong Fei Hung.
- Wong Hung?

1253
01:48:31,726 --> 01:48:32,934
Foon is trying to escape!

1254
01:48:33,603 --> 01:48:34,603
Escape?

1255
01:49:01,631 --> 01:49:02,631
How dare you.

1256
01:49:12,475 --> 01:49:15,560
Come back! Get him!

1257
01:49:46,384 --> 01:49:47,717
Stop right there

1258
01:49:50,054 --> 01:49:51,888
I've brought some Chinese gal here
for Mr. Jackson.

1259
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:55,141
We come to see him tonight. Open the gate.

1260
01:49:55,393 --> 01:49:58,520
Mr. Jackson is expecting us, come on

1261
01:49:59,188 --> 01:50:02,983
Open the gate now, come on.

1262
01:50:05,486 --> 01:50:07,696
We're getting cold, please.

1263
01:50:07,947 --> 01:50:09,781
Mr. Jackson will be very happy.

1264
01:50:11,284 --> 01:50:14,452
Open the gate. - Open the gate.

1265
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:21,001
Thank you, come on.

1266
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,341
Take it easy! - Yes, Big Brother!

1267
01:50:28,593 --> 01:50:30,719
It hurts. - Right!

1268
01:50:32,179 --> 01:50:35,890
Master, these people have turned on me...

1269
01:50:36,142 --> 01:50:38,518
They'll do the same to you, don't trust them.

1270
01:50:38,769 --> 01:50:39,853
You don't trust your brothers,

1271
01:50:40,104 --> 01:50:41,688
yet speak out for Wong?

1272
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:46,484
How is it? Too cruel, not used to it?

1273
01:50:51,324 --> 01:50:52,449
Let him go,

1274
01:50:52,783 --> 01:50:54,075
I'll do anything you want.

1275
01:50:54,327 --> 01:50:56,703
What makes you want to sacrifice for him?

1276
01:50:56,954 --> 01:51:00,874
Bargain with me? Damn you.

1277
01:51:01,125 --> 01:51:02,667
Are you Master Wong's woman?

1278
01:51:06,255 --> 01:51:08,840
When I'm done, your face will be so scratched...

1279
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:11,801
Master Wong won't recognize you.

1280
01:51:15,056 --> 01:51:16,723
Where's the woman you took away today?

1281
01:51:18,184 --> 01:51:23,021
- Big Brother! Master Wong is here!
- Master Wong?

1282
01:51:24,982 --> 01:51:25,982
Fei Hung?

1283
01:51:26,233 --> 01:51:27,776
Arm yourselves. - Yes!

1284
01:51:28,444 --> 01:51:30,570
Get all the guns out. - Yes.

1285
01:51:30,863 --> 01:51:32,989
Go, get all the woman on the ship.

1286
01:51:33,491 --> 01:51:35,367
Master, Wong challenges us.

1287
01:51:35,618 --> 01:51:36,743
Fight for us?

1288
01:51:36,994 --> 01:51:38,203
Don't worry!

1289
01:51:40,081 --> 01:51:42,165
Foon! - Go!

1290
01:51:42,416 --> 01:51:44,542
Aunt 13!

1291
01:51:44,794 --> 01:51:46,336
Go!

1292
01:51:46,587 --> 01:51:49,339
Les see how Master Yim
finish Wong Fei Hung.

1293
01:52:01,977 --> 01:52:04,562
You're not needed here, go search for Aunt 13.

1294
01:52:04,814 --> 01:52:06,189
Yes.

1295
01:52:07,608 --> 01:52:09,109
Master Wong!

1296
01:52:10,611 --> 01:52:14,614
Master Yim, win or lose, is just a game.

1297
01:52:17,034 --> 01:52:18,868
You've got no excuse not to fight.

1298
01:52:25,584 --> 01:52:26,793
As you wish.

1299
01:53:28,314 --> 01:53:29,731
Is down there!

1300
01:53:30,274 --> 01:53:31,524
"External Chi Kung"?

1301
01:53:32,026 --> 01:53:35,069
Today only one of us leaves here alive.

1302
01:53:37,490 --> 01:53:38,531
Hey, how do you fire a gun?

1303
01:54:10,648 --> 01:54:11,856
Don't worry, we have guns.

1304
01:54:49,937 --> 01:54:53,565
You said you're good, come on.

1305
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,905
I'll help you, Master.

1306
01:55:03,367 --> 01:55:04,784
Porky?

1307
01:55:16,839 --> 01:55:18,047
Anymore?

1308
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,486
Hey, Buck Teeth So! Is you?

1309
01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:45,491
Come up and get me down. Quickly!

1310
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,912
Aunt 13's been kidnapped by the Shaho Gang.

1311
01:55:49,163 --> 01:55:50,121
What? - What?

1312
01:55:51,582 --> 01:55:53,333
Aunt 13's been kidnapped by the Shaho Gang,

1313
01:55:53,792 --> 01:55:58,296
Hey, get me down, Buck Teeth So!

1314
01:55:58,839 --> 01:56:00,465
I'm sorry, I forgot!

1315
01:56:04,428 --> 01:56:05,762
Your Excellency.

1316
01:56:06,722 --> 01:56:08,056
Enemy is approaching.

1317
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:16,481
General, please!

1318
01:56:16,732 --> 01:56:19,734
This is General Wickens of
Her Majesty's Royal Armed Forces.

1319
01:56:19,985 --> 01:56:21,319
I'm escorting this Chinese officer...

1320
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:23,696
who comes in search of escape prisoners.

1321
01:56:23,948 --> 01:56:27,408
On his behalf, I request permission
to search your premises.

1322
01:56:27,826 --> 01:56:30,370
This is the territory of
the United States of America.

1323
01:56:30,621 --> 01:56:32,705
Permission is not granted, and any trespassing...

1324
01:56:32,957 --> 01:56:35,458
will be regarded as direct
violation of our Federal Laws.

1325
01:56:36,210 --> 01:56:37,669
Damn your Yankee laws!

1326
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,337
Damn you Brits to hell!

1327
01:56:46,470 --> 01:56:48,596
Stop! Don't shoot... stop!...

1328
01:56:48,847 --> 01:56:51,599
Excellency, is dangerous here. Better leave.

1329
01:56:59,733 --> 01:57:01,192
Brothers, get inside.

1330
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:06,990
Big Brother, anymore?

1331
01:57:07,241 --> 01:57:08,324
Kai, I'll help Master,

1332
01:57:08,575 --> 01:57:09,534
you save Aunt 13.

1333
01:57:09,785 --> 01:57:11,536
No, I'll stay!

1334
01:57:11,787 --> 01:57:13,496
You go!

1335
01:57:13,956 --> 01:57:15,957
I'm Big Brother! You listen to me!

1336
01:57:27,678 --> 01:57:30,221
You both don't have to stay. Go save Aunt 13.

1337
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,265
Go!

1338
01:59:44,148 --> 01:59:45,398
Master Wong!

1339
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:25,646
A sneak attack.

1340
02:00:26,565 --> 02:00:28,357
Is all in self defense.

1341
02:00:29,276 --> 02:00:30,902
You call this Yim's Martial Arts?

1342
02:00:31,653 --> 02:00:34,322
The worlïs full of surprises.
Must take precautions.

1343
02:00:37,117 --> 02:00:40,494
Be quick, the ship's leaving. Take them aboard!

1344
02:00:41,622 --> 02:00:42,747
Go, bitch!

1345
02:00:42,998 --> 02:00:46,542
Fei Hung... is Aunt 13. Fei Hung!

1346
02:00:58,805 --> 02:01:02,600
Fei Hung... I'm Aunt 13...

1347
02:01:03,727 --> 02:01:07,480
Bring her to the ship, go.

1348
02:01:09,566 --> 02:01:11,275
Troops, attention.

1349
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:16,197
Mr. Jackson, Master Wong is here!

1350
02:01:17,115 --> 02:01:18,866
Master Wong, take him on!

1351
02:01:19,701 --> 02:01:21,035
The ship's over there!

1352
02:01:22,287 --> 02:01:25,748
Hung, take them to the cabin.

1353
02:01:25,999 --> 02:01:26,916
Yes, sir.

1354
02:01:26,917 --> 02:01:28,542
Line up the men, ready now.

1355
02:01:36,635 --> 02:01:38,552
Go down, quick!

1356
02:01:42,182 --> 02:01:43,266
Turn around.

1357
02:02:00,075 --> 02:02:01,951
There... there!

1358
02:02:03,787 --> 02:02:05,329
Leave him to me.

1359
02:02:06,498 --> 02:02:08,291
They're yours.

1360
02:03:32,292 --> 02:03:36,629
Master Wong!

1361
02:03:38,715 --> 02:03:40,591
Master Yim, we are done!

1362
02:03:48,308 --> 02:03:49,433
He's leaving.

1363
02:03:49,434 --> 02:03:51,185
Master Wong, watch out!

1364
02:03:57,692 --> 02:04:01,070
Master Wong, where're you?
We haven't finished yet.

1365
02:04:10,414 --> 02:04:12,957
Master!

1366
02:04:23,635 --> 02:04:26,095
I am Iron Vest...

1367
02:04:26,346 --> 02:04:29,515
Master Yim!

1368
02:04:35,981 --> 02:04:41,026
Master Yim... - Wong...

1369
02:04:41,278 --> 02:04:47,283
We can't fight guns with Kung fu.

1370
02:05:00,464 --> 02:05:01,714
You scum.

1371
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:10,407
Master Wong, don't go!

1372
02:06:13,995 --> 02:06:16,956
Still going? Don't shoot!

1373
02:06:17,207 --> 02:06:18,207
Load the cannon.

1374
02:06:21,753 --> 02:06:24,880
This is Commander Man from the
Provincial Government of Guangdong.

1375
02:06:28,385 --> 02:06:32,763
12 o'clock 30 degrees.

1376
02:06:38,103 --> 02:06:41,021
No, 10 o'clock 40 degrees. - What?

1377
02:06:41,731 --> 02:06:43,691
10 o'clock 40 degrees. - Aim, fire!

1378
02:06:43,942 --> 02:06:46,443
Wait! - Fire!

1379
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:53,909
Oh, God!

1380
02:06:56,871 --> 02:06:59,415
Damn you Yankees. They've hit my ship.

1381
02:07:24,441 --> 02:07:25,899
You there, check the ship.

1382
02:07:26,943 --> 02:07:30,571
Who is this Wong Fei Hung?

1383
02:07:37,162 --> 02:07:38,287
Foon!

1384
02:07:39,289 --> 02:07:40,372
Kill him!

1385
02:07:45,670 --> 02:07:46,712
Watch out!

1386
02:08:05,023 --> 02:08:08,651
Master Wong, have the guts to fight man to man.

1387
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:11,820
Fei Hung, he's got a gun on his knife.

1388
02:08:12,072 --> 02:08:13,405
Watch out, don't fall into his trap!

1389
02:08:13,657 --> 02:08:15,032
Shut up.

1390
02:08:33,134 --> 02:08:34,760
Bitch, you brought them here,

1391
02:08:35,011 --> 02:08:37,513
so I'll burn your face.

1392
02:08:37,764 --> 02:08:39,723
Les see which is faster, you or my gun.

1393
02:08:44,896 --> 02:08:46,063
Die!

1394
02:08:52,862 --> 02:08:54,488
Oh, let me go!

1395
02:09:22,267 --> 02:09:23,434
Mr. Jackson. - Sir.

1396
02:09:25,437 --> 02:09:26,687
Mr. Jackson and the Shaho Gang...

1397
02:09:26,938 --> 02:09:28,772
sold women to America.

1398
02:09:29,149 --> 02:09:30,441
Your Excellency, save us.

1399
02:09:31,693 --> 02:09:36,572
Shaho Gang, I will reward to catch all woman.

1400
02:09:36,823 --> 02:09:37,865
By law, you can't kill me,

1401
02:09:38,116 --> 02:09:39,742
you must hand me to the Govt.

1402
02:09:44,789 --> 02:09:46,123
You have violated international law.

1403
02:09:46,374 --> 02:09:47,624
Put down the gun!

1404
02:09:47,876 --> 02:09:51,044
- Why won't it fire?
- Did I forget to load it?

1405
02:09:52,255 --> 02:09:54,882
If you don't put it down, I'll kill him!

1406
02:09:55,133 --> 02:09:56,425
Put down the gun!

1407
02:10:10,648 --> 02:10:12,191
You've hurt a Chinese Official...

1408
02:10:12,442 --> 02:10:13,776
in a forbidden area.

1409
02:10:14,027 --> 02:10:14,985
How will you explain it to the Chinese Govt?

1410
02:10:15,236 --> 02:10:18,530
Don't let even one Chinese live.

1411
02:10:18,782 --> 02:10:25,078
Then I won't have to explain to any Govt.!

1412
02:10:32,337 --> 02:10:33,754
You scum!

1413
02:10:34,339 --> 02:10:35,547
You don't have to explain!

1414
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:52,898
- Your Excellency.
- Wow, you dare jump this high.

1415
02:10:53,149 --> 02:10:55,567
Chilïs play. No big deal.

1416
02:10:57,695 --> 02:11:00,989
Thank you Your Excellency!

1417
02:11:01,241 --> 02:11:03,116
All credit to Master Wong.

1418
02:11:03,368 --> 02:11:04,743
Don't mention it. - Thanks Master Wong!

1419
02:11:04,994 --> 02:11:06,328
Thank you Master Wong!

1420
02:11:20,969 --> 02:11:24,304
China's changed so much, how call I cope?

1421
02:11:25,306 --> 02:11:28,517
America? Do they really have gold there?

1422
02:11:29,811 --> 02:11:31,728
If they really do have gold,

1423
02:11:32,063 --> 02:11:34,398
why would they come here?

1424
02:11:35,775 --> 02:11:37,985
Maybe we're standing on gold now.

1425
02:12:07,765 --> 02:12:10,434
After this drink, you'll be my Master.

1426
02:12:10,768 --> 02:12:13,562
But Aunt 13 and I are so close now...

1427
02:12:13,855 --> 02:12:15,689
We'll be together from morning to night.

1428
02:12:16,024 --> 02:12:17,524
If one day she marries me,

1429
02:12:17,942 --> 02:12:20,068
then you'll have to call me Uncle.

1430
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:25,741
I'll be your senior so you'll have to serve me.

1431
02:12:26,409 --> 02:12:28,619
Foon, what are you thinking?

1432
02:12:30,246 --> 02:12:31,663
Have some tea, Master!
