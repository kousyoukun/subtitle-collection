1
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:21,016
Look, look,
they're shooting at us.

2
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,649
Open fire, shoot!

3
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,717
- Bah, it's a dance of dragons.
- Return to your posts.

4
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,009
Drums.

5
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,763
Master Wong, be careful
of the foreign ship's guns.

6
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,702
- Dare to come up?
- I dare.

7
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,335
Give me the lion's tail!

8
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,427
"Magnificent aspirations
soar to the skies."

9
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,849
"Chivalry shoots up into the sky."

10
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,529
Wong Fei-Hung, you take a look.

11
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:43,284
A growing number of western
warships anchored in our harbor.

12
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,954
Hong Kong was given to the United Kingdom.
Macao was given to Portugal.

13
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,248
Russia occupies Heilongjiang.

14
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,209
Even our own ancestors
couldn't keep the invaders out.

15
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:58,173
I, Lau Wing-Fook, have been sent to Vietnam,
someone else's region, to fight the French Army.

16
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:07,057
If Vietnamese people saw this 'My Land,
My People' plaque, what would they think?

17
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,393
- Come here!
- Yes, my lord!

18
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,644
Take it down.

19
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,855
- Hurry up!
- Yes!

20
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,148
Slow down.

21
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:21,405
Lord Lau, the current court makes frequent
changes. Maybe you'll be transferred back soon?

22
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,493
The court quarrels too much.

23
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,222
They sent me to war, and yet they despise
me for having too much military strength.

24
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:35,169
After I'm gone, this Navy, which I have
been with for so long, will be disbanded.

25
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,965
Wong Fei-Hung, you're the
coach of our Black Flag Army.

26
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,594
You incorporate them into a
militia and continue practising.

27
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:49,641
In case a powerful enemy attacks,
they can defend their homeland.

28
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,478
Master Wong...

29
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,314
Get up.

30
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,277
Lord Lau, don't worry.
I hope you'll be back soon.

31
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,658
Wong Fei-Hung, written on this fan are the unequal
treaties our country signed with westerners.

32
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,244
Seeing the fan is
like seeing the man.

33
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:14,375
I hope when I get back, these
treaties will have been forgotten.

34
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:21,006
UNEQUAL TREATY

35
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,260

44
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,159
Barbecued pork buns.

45
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,626
Not again!

46
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,881
Third Uncle, what did you say?

47
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,781
Now the provincial capital has more
westerners, dates are difficult to arrange.

48
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,601
Old Cheung, you're impressive
doing business with foreign devils.

49
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,396
Couldn't make a living in Tangshan,
so I had to go to England and work hard.

50
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,640
This time, Old Chiu only brought 'The
Concubine Sparrow' to photograph with you.

51
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,693
This bird has made a
show of the limelight.

52
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,613
A photograph is a small token,
you'll have one in a while.

53
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,656
That's very considerate,
thanks for your blessing.

54
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,117
- Master.
- Master Wong.

55
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,079
Dear 'Brothers'.
Hello, everyone.

56
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,599
- Fei-Hung!
- Grand Uncle Gan, haven't seen you in years.

57
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,416
- You have more spirit.
- Thanks to you...

58
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,170
Fei-Hung, look who's come
back with me this time.

59
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,342
Master Wong, have you had tea?
A lot of people are waiting for you.

60
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,348
- 13th Aunt?
- Fei-Hung.

61
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,395
- She wants to shake your hand.
- Foreigners greet by shaking hands.

62
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,980
I'll introduce you.
Her name is Joanna.

63
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,360
- 'Do'? What's 'do'?
- She's greeting you: 'How do you do?'

64
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,070
You have to say 'thank you'.

65
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,740
I-kill you... I-kill you...
You're welcome, you're welcome.

66
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,868
- Fei-Hung, let's get a picture with the bird.
- Alright.

67
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,874
- Sit down.
- Fei-Hung, photographs are easy.

68
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,627
- How come?
- Look over there.

69
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:55,549
Don't move... otherwise it won't be pretty.
Sit up straight.

70
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:01,054
Ready.
1-2-3!

71
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,349
What's the matter?

72
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,815
It's boiling water!

73
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,569
- Are you alright? Have you been scalded?
- I'm fine.

74
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,489
- This foreign toy is too dangerous. Stop playing!
- A little too much magnesium powder.

75
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,628
- You're shameful, telling me not to move!
- Did you get frightened?

76
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:28,707
Grand Uncle Gan, fortunately you asked me to
come, otherwise, you'd be just like this bird.

77
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,791
You think so?

78
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:36,173
Old Chiu? Old Chiu?
Old Chiu?

79
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,012
I'm leaving in two days. Your 13th
Aunt went to England for two years.

80
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,055
Kept saying she wanted
to return to Tangshan.

81
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,975
This is fine, too.
Saves her from mixing with foreigners.

82
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,396
- Could you watch her for me?
- Eh, watch her?

83
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,908
Old Chiu, answer me!
Old Chiu, don't frighten me!

84
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:09,206
Acupoint...

85
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,506
Is anyone there?

86
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,551
I'm here to see Master Wong.

87
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,638
Is anyone there?

88
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,853
Who... who's there?

89
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,857
What can I do for you?

90
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,276
- I've just come from Meixian County.
- Oh, Meixian...

91
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,905
My name's Leung Foon.
I've come to be Master Wong's apprentice.

92
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,658
- He... he...
- He's not here?

93
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,702
- I... I... I am...
- You?

94
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,830
- You are?
- Wong... Master Wong...

95
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,957
- You're Master Wong?
- No...

96
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,251
- You?
- I am...

97
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,877
You're Master Wong!

98
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,588
I'm a cowherd, looking
for a cow to practice.

99
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,466
Carelessly, I let the cow kick my arm.
Can you check it for me?

100
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,178
Alright!

101
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,640
Not this one, this one.

102
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:16,064
Master Wong, I hurt my arm.
You're wrapping up my leg. Why?

103
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:22,529
Now... now you say.
Too... it's too late!

104
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,534
It's stiff, Master!
It's all stiff!

105
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,874
You... are you alright?

106
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,629
Master, did you wrap me up
like this to teach me Kung Fu?

107
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,301
Strive? You want me to work hard?
OK, let me show you hard work.

108
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,180
I can still move.
Can be high and low.

109
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,266
This stump is really amazing.

110
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,187
Work?
Work must be done, right?

111
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,441
Master, I get it.
I'll show you a few more flips.

112
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,535
Expel the burglar!

113
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,372
- Who is he?
- Master is teaching me Kung Fu.

114
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,875
'Toothbrush' So is
teaching you Kung Fu?

115
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,753
- Who is he?
- Toothbrush So.

116
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,671
You're not Master Wong?

117
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:27,427
You're this Toothbrush So.
Who's that?

118
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,012
He's Master Wong's apprentice.

119
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,599
- Hey, so who are you then?
- I'm Master Wong's favourite apprentice, Ling Wan-Kai.

120
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,362
- Hey, how did you end up like this?
- Don't ask. I must catch the opera troupe to find work.

121
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,604
I'm going!

122
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,818
If I don't go, he'll wrap up
my other leg the same way.

123
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:57,916
Leung Foon! Leung Foon, quickly
repair the hole in the roof.

124
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,459
The performance is about to open.

125
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,046
I came to be a martial actor, but you
order me to climb up and repair this roof.

126
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,465
Your way of doing it
isn't according to regulation.

127
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,843
If you don't climb, how do you
know how good your Kung Fu is?

128
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,722
As soon as I make it famous, I'll tell
you to climb up and repair the roof.

129
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,030
What are you doing?
Tearing down the building?

130
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,367
What are you doing?
Tumbling on the roof?

131
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,245
I thought the foreign
ship opened fire.

132
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,290
When the heavens thunder,
you think it's a cannon.

133
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,545
I'll go with you to the USA to dig for
gold. No need to waste time here.

134
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,880
Country boy!
Doesn't know anything!

135
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:49,009
Now, don't move, otherwise
it won't look good.

136
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,301
Are you ready?

137
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,430
A foreign woman can speak Chinese?

138
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,060
Looks like Tangshan
will soon become foreign.

139
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,401
Hey, wait for me...

140
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,571
- 1-2-
- Wait for me!

141
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,371
Wait for you?

142
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,272
The bucket's stuck!

143
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,359
Leung Foon, where
the hell are you?

144
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm changing my clothes.

145
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,073
Get to work!
Want to be lazy?

146
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,409
That Leung Foon talks about how
good his Kung Fu is all day long.

147
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,578
Insists on climbing
up to repair the roof.

148
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,358
Doing somersaults like you do
will make the stage collapse.

149
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,069
Collapsing the stage? You show me how to
do that by somersaulting! Talking nonsense!

150
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,716
Young lady, I'm really sorry.
The clothes have been washed clean.

151
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,469
- I've already asked someone to iron them.
- Thank you, Boss.

152
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,640
Oh, yes.
Do you want to change the water basin?

153
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,851
No need, I'm almost done.
OK?

154
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,297
Who's there?

155
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,468
You didn't...

156
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,105
- We have a new opera, please come take photographs.
- Good, Boss!

157
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,274
Be careful, rain has
made the road slippery.

158
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,236
Fake foreign woman, wearing
fancy clothes like a costume!

159
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,613
Miss!

160
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,074
Umbrella.

161
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:14,589
Uncle, come on up.
We have lots of girls here.

162
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,441
Inspection takes so long.

163
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:28,454
There's gunfire. What's up?
Who is it?

164
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,582
PO CHI LAM

165
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,545
Master! Master!

166
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,637
- Master!
- It's Sai-Wing. Open the main door now.

167
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,139
Master!

168
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,482
Lucky you opened up fast, or
I'd have burst the door open.

169
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,109
Later, I'll buy you tea.

170
00:21:58,901 --> 00:21:59,944
Give way!

171
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,199
- Kai, who's been shot?
- It's the greengrocer, Uncle Nine.

172
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,036
- What's the grievance?
- I don't know, ask Master.

173
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,043
Toothbrush So, you're going
to spill the medicine again.

174
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,046
- Pork... pork... pork...
- Pork...? Butcher Wing!

175
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,922
Calling me fat makes me fat!

176
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,448
Been back in China so long and
you still can't speak Chinese!

177
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,429
- Pork... pork...
- T-t-toothbrush!

178
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,598
- 'Porky'!
- So, bring the medicine.

179
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,576
You don't understand Chinese,
what medicine are you taking?

180
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,518
You're brothers,
what's the arguing about?

181
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,605
Master, I'm teaching
him how to be Chinese.

182
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,750
- Get the metal trauma medicine.
- Metal trauma medicine?

183
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,777
Three words.
They're all three words.

184
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,654
Master, I can't read.

185
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,743
So, you laugh at people who don't
speak Chinese? Ah So, come on.

186
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:54,791
'Seven Wounds Powder'.
'Hemostatic Powder'.

187
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,794
That's Toothbrush So, they
say he came back from America.

188
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,839
I heard he studied Western medicine there,
and came back to study with Master Wong.

189
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,841
Then he's pretty good, too.

190
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,221
- Master, water's here!
- Finally, the bullet's out.

191
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,849
Uncle Nine, you'll be alright.

192
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,478
- Master, this bullet's from a rifle.
- Wrap up his wounds.

193
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,333
Now there are so many foreign ships
in the harbor, and flags of all kinds.

194
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:22,157
Uncle Nine couldn't distinguish between
the American and British flags.

195
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,154
So, he mistakenly boarded the
wrong ship and was injured.

196
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,549
Now the capital is engaged in
the Self-Strengthening Movement.

197
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,013
Whatever the dispute, it's us
Chinese that will come to grief.

198
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,415
Then how can we Chinese survive?
We don't depend on Manchurian dogs!

199
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,918
Manchurian tyrants have
occupied our Central Plain.

200
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,171
Now they collude with red-haired devils!
Selling out our mountains and rivers!

201
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,949
Militia Brothers, we're going
to take down the foreign ships!

202
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,890
- Calm... calm... calm down!
- You're teaching me?

203
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,893
- Pork... pork...
- Impudent, call me Senior!

204
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,354
- Sai-Wing!
- Master.

205
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,942
You're so impetuous,
don't you interfere.

206
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:10,408
Now it's about human life, I'll call on the imperial
court, and clarify matters with the Westerners.

207
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,872
Otherwise, how can we Chinese
continue living in Foshan?

208
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,642
Sir, excuse me...

209
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,063
Ah So, you explain
it to the manager.

210
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,088
How come... your words
are so... fluent?

211
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,265
Why put all these knives
and forks on the table?

212
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,821
Ah So, you take the decision
on ordering some dim sum.

213
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:45,044
Ah Foon, today I need your help.
You help me collect tickets at the door.

214
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,297
I'm here to learn martial acting,
and you ask me to collect tickets?

215
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:52,051
I have no choice. All the workers went
to San Francisco to dig for gold.

216
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,971
Gold digging?
If there's gold, then they should dig.

217
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,139
But is there really
such a thing, boss?

218
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,977
You think I'd cheat you?
All the newspapers are full of it.

219
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,063
If it weren't for so many people
working for me, I'd go, too!

220
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,650
Newspaper?
What's a newspaper?

221
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,361
They're here to collect
protection fees.

222
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:15,741
- Didn't you pay respect at the pier?
- Yes, they're Shahe killers here to grab land.

223
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:19,287
Those two can go eat shit!
So few men here to grab land?

224
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,414
Negotiating with them means
we would be the bullies.

225
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,498
Right!

226
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,228
- What are you doing?
- I know you've learnt a couple of moves.

227
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,962
Didn't you say you wanted to
make a name in the capital?

228
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,966
- Now's a great opportunity.
- That's not what I meant.

229
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:36,470
It's not a good idea to collect tickets here.
They said they came to visit you specially.

230
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,974
Testing my skill? Don't tease me.

231
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:44,270
Ah, Boss, open up!
Boss, open up quickly! Boss!

232
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,939
Oh, no matinee today,
no tickets.

233
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,626
- Thanks, boss! I'll come back another time.
- Brother! Come down!

234
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,360
- Thanks!
- Come down!

235
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,632
Damn it. Came all the way to the
theater and there's no tickets.

236
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,533
Next time I won't come,
even if they invite me.

237
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,832
I know you're Leung Foon,
here to negotiate with me.

238
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,501
- No, I collect tickets.
- We're here for the protection fee.

239
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,463
My brothers tell me
you're a good fighter.

240
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,923
A single man who dares
take on so many of us.

241
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,510
You really have guts!

242
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,596
I'm flattered.
I'm off to prepare your gift.

243
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,556
I'll visit all you
gentlemen later.

244
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,184
We can't accept that.

245
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:30,441
Don't be so formal.
Chopping off your hand, that will do!

246
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,859
Chop my hand?

247
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,780
Grab him!

248
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,699
Don't run!

249
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,411
That's enough!
So many people bullying one guy.

250
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:46,374
- Come here.
- Let's find a good time and place to duel.

251
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,460
No need, it's here and now.

252
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:02,264
Catch him!
Stop!

253
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:13,818
- Some people are fighting in the theater.
- Yes, they have knives.

254
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,737
Don't run! Stop!
Grab him!

255
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,073
- Excuse me, excuse me...
- What's going on?

256
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,658
Fighting?
Go outside and fight!

257
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,910
Don't get in the way of our business.
Get out!

258
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,873
Brother, is there trouble?

259
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:32,237
Those Shahe bullies are here to collect a protection
fee. They want to compete with me but there's too many.

260
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,838
Slaughter that bastard!

261
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,093
- Look, an argument!
- Whereabouts?

262
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,813
That's Porky,
Wong's Fei-Hung's apprentice.

263
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,940
Seems I've never met him.

264
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:57,903
Porky Wing, I'll give face to your master,
Wong Fei-Hung. Today, I'm letting you go.

265
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,802
Wouldn't waste my time fighting you!

266
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:02,658
- Ah, you're Wong Fei-Hung's apprentice?
- Of course I am.

267
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,429
I've been to Po Chi Lam. I saw your
fellow apprentice, Toothbrush So.

268
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,996
That fake foreign devil!

269
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,456
- Leung Foon!
- What?

270
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,374
Don't think I'm joking with you.

271
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,587
If you don't surrender your hand to Shahe,
I'll make you disappear from Foshan.

272
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,506
- Let's go back to Shahe.
- Let's go!

273
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:23,679
Eh, you daren't fight Wong Fei-Hung's apprentice?
Want a hand? I'll give you a big pig's trotter!

274
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,104
- Big Brother, do we stand down?
- Stand down? Tear his stand down!

275
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,531
- Brother Wing, this one's for him.
- Give it free, not doing business today!

276
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,869
You rotten brat!

277
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,777
Shahe's stupid, Shahe's clumsy!
Shahe's entire family getting wasted!

278
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,195
Still singing?

279
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,666
Making trouble?
I'll beat you to death!

280
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:47,888
Buy sweet cakes.
Eat sweet cakes, watch the fight.

281
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,473
A bowl of sweet tofu pudding.

282
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:04,154
Go to hell!
I'll chop you! Don't run!

283
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:17,126
You call this a fight?
Have some water, liven things up!

284
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,922
- Who's pouring boiling water?
- Them! Go up and see!

285
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,343
- Who's pouring boiling water? Come out!
- Let's go!

286
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,154
Old bastard, pouring
boiling water on us?

287
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,848
- Not me, I was eating barbecued pork buns.
- Barbecued pork buns?

288
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:57,082
This is General Wickens of the British ship,
and Mr Jackson of the US merchant ship.

289
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,769
They are most generous, and will
no longer investigate the shooting.

290
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,713
You mustn't persist in demanding
compensation for the grocer incident.

291
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,275
This isn't fair to the grocer.
How can we calm the people's anger?

292
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:09,845
People's anger? Wong Fei-Hung,
which court sent you here?

293
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,475
You're just the hoi polloi. What qualifies
you to discuss policy with an official?

294
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,411
Now the Capital is in the process
of the Self-Strengthening Movement...

295
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,189
relationships with foreigners
are to endure a period of calm.

296
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,399
Take a step back and
view the broader picture.

297
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:27,196
Here, this bread is
made from our flour.

298
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,950
So, you appreciate western cuisine?

299
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:36,872
Westerners carve out concessions in our
region, and set up restricted areas.

300
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:41,168
If our countrymen still doubt each other, and
are tolerant in all respects of foreigners...

301
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,463
sooner or later, we won't even have
the flour to make steamed buns.

302
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:49,593
Wong Fei-Hung, I know you have a deep friendship
with the Black Flag Army's Lau Wing-Fook.

303
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:53,531
He thinks the whip cannot reach him in the south,
even when expressing different views to the court.

304
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:58,060
Now the court has sent me south to watch you, and
find an individual to punish as an example to others.

305
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:10,864
Western lady, are you alright?

306
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,672
Master, it's people from our militia.

307
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,176
Master?

308
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,970
You stop them.

309
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,640
Stop!
Tell them not to fight.

310
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,559
Don't fight!

311
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,564
Kai, I didn't ask you to fight.
I said, tell them not to fight!

312
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,526
Fuck you, don't fight!

313
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,574
Drop your weapons!
Still fighting?

314
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,245
Don't do it!

315
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,060
- Good skills.
- Of course!

316
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,441
- Big Brother, that guy seems to be Wong Fei-Hung.
- Wong Fei-Hung...

317
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,152
We have many people,
so chop him as well!

318
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,075
- Don't fight!
- You dare hurt me?

319
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,454
Don't want to fight?
Here!

320
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,167
He hit you? Don't fight!

321
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,212
Don't fight, Ah Kai!

322
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,963
- Don't fight!
- Don't fight!

323
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:53,175
- Don't fight!
- I told you to stop fighting!

324
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,469
- I told you to stop fighting!
- Still fighting?

325
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,431
Really, stop fighting.
They're coming over. Let go!

326
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,148
Big Brother, are you alright?

327
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,068
- Who just kicked me?
- I don't know...

328
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,863
- Have you gone up yet?
- Sure...

329
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,156
Give it to me again!

330
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,039
Toothbrush So!

331
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,267
So, explain to them that
they shouldn't misunderstand.

332
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,144
No need to explain.

333
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,523
If there were no restricted areas
in China, we wouldn't be safe.

334
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,191
This foreign devil can speak Chinese.

335
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,528
Still coming?

336
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,408
Don't call me a foreign devil,
Chinese devil.

337
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,869
You listen to me.
We're doing business.

338
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,538
If you don't use your brains,
how can you earn a fortune?

339
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:09,126
Wong Fei-Hung, I'm warning you.
Stop messing about.

340
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,837
Or else you'll suffer!

341
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,425
Goodbye, foreign devil.

342
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,516
- Shoot whoever resists.
- Let's go.

343
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,771
The soldiers are here.
Run for it!

344
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,940
Out of the way, I'm going first.

345
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:35,861
Stop! Don't go!

346
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,697
Put the weapons down.
You call yourselves a militia?

347
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,575
Porky Wing ran away?

348
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,622
Nobody move!
Disobey and be killed.

349
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,751
Wong Fei-Hung, this district
is under western jurisdiction.

350
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,544
Now the militia come
in and cause trouble.

351
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:55,714
You're the militia's chief instructor.
How will you explain to the court?

352
00:36:55,923 --> 00:37:00,677
My lord, they're the disbanded navy,
trained by the court.

353
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,932
- There must be a reason for them to do this.
- What reason? The court disbands, but you offer shelter?

354
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,055
The militia is now directly
supervised by the court.

355
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,185
Lord Governor!

356
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,540
Tell them to report for duty at the court,
otherwise, I'll arrest the men immediately.

357
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,690
- My lord...
- Furthermore...

358
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,859
All damages are the
responsibility of Wong Fei-Hung.

359
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,361
Yes, my lord.

360
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:35,963
Beware of fire.
Beware of thieves.

361
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:49,017
Master, I've lost my appetite. I heard
that those men came over from Shahe.

362
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:53,188
The court now wants the militia to report.
Would they seize the chance to detain us?

363
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:57,651
- Master!
- Master Wong...

364
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,111
Sit down.

365
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:06,785
The court has the right to prosecute. If someone
framed you, the truth will come to light.

366
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:12,124
After eating this meal, only once matters
are concluded can we sit together again.

367
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,543
Everyone eat.

368
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,026
Militia take order,
prepare to eat.

369
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,736
Pick up the food!

370
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,950
Eat!
Swallow!

371
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,328
Pick up the food.

372
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,750
Eat!
Swallow!

373
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,062
13th Aunt.

374
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:19,066
You needn't worry so much,
the militia men may be alright.

375
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,863
It's so late,
you're still awake?

376
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,366
I'm going to take your
measurements for a suit.

377
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,120
A suit? Why on earth would
a Chinese man wear a suit?

378
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,748
In future, you can wear
it in a foreign country.

379
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,546
13th Aunt, are foreign
countries really so good?

380
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:46,176
Why... what do we have
to learn from others?

381
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,405
They invented the steam engine,
among many other things.

382
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,724
Their science is more advanced than ours.
Without science, we fall behind.

383
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:01,817
If you have time, you really must
tell me what the outside world is like.

384
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:18,917
13th Aunt...

385
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,465
If it's so good over there,
why did you want to come back?

386
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:33,140
- There's something here they don't have.
- What don't they have?

387
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,560
People.

388
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,946
The people I want to see
don't exist over there.

389
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:54,161
Although I've been away this past
two years, my heart is still here.

390
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:57,247
In fact, I thought
of you every day.

391
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,333
You're most considerate.

392
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,172
- 13th Aunt!
- What's the matter?

393
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,507
I thought... excuse me.

394
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,136
Fei-Hung, you and I are related only
by two generations of family contract.

395
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,947
Actually, we don't have
a blood relationship.

396
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,600
We grew up together.
Don't call me Aunt anymore.

397
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,812
How can generational seniority switch?
I'll do it myself.

398
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,239
How much is this?
Close enough.

399
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:36,912
Some things can't be close enough.
If it's not exact, what's the point?

400
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,915
Therefore, a Chinese man
should never wear a suit.

401
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,375
Because Chinese are Chinese,
westerners are western.

402
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,564
The railway will be built here soon,
and the telegraph office opened.

403
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:51,051
In future, everything will change.
China must also change to follow the world.

404
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,431
You're right.

405
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,893
Now the foreigners are
here with guns and warships.

406
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,937
Everything is changing.

407
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,856
I don't know what's going
to happen in future.

408
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:08,902
Although I appreciate your gift,
you must take it back.

409
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:13,573
In future, when all Chinese men
wear suits, I'll wear it again.

410
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,478
Believe in Jesus,
an eternal life...

411
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,649
Get lost, Jesus devil!

412
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,777
Be cautious, meet
the God of Prosperity.

413
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,030
Sir, we bought the God of Prosperity.
Sir, we bought the...

414
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,132
- God of Prosperity.
- You, come here now!

415
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:59,327
- Sir, we bought the God of Prosperity...
- Over there!

416
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:04,291
Did you buy my God of Prosperity,
or buy the previous God of Prosperity?

417
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:08,128
He's already under a well.
Want to see him?

418
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,171
Buy another one.

419
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,174
If I pay him, what happens
when the other guy comes?

420
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,177
- Sir, are you hiring anyone?
- You want to flatter me?

421
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,264
- Sir, the situation is bad now.
- Give me that!

422
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,308
If the situation's bad,
I'll look after you.

423
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,328
Sir, take it, but don't leave it empty.
Leaving me profit would be good, too!

424
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,855
You want to profit,
so I don't profit?

425
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,692
Still profiteering at this
time of national hardship?

426
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,279
Wong Fei-Hung!

427
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:37,907
You guys came here from Shahe?
Come with me to the court.

428
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,284
Save me!

429
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,929
Killing one's own people?

430
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:11,566
Move it!
Run!

431
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,033
Move it!
Where are those useless bastards?

432
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:36,049
Go to hell!

433
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,602
Fucking hell, it's too high!

434
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,530
- Run...
- Wow! Superb! Really good!

435
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:02,033
Master Wong just used his
'shadowless kick'. Did you see it?

436
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:02,909
No, I didn't.

437
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:07,539
Dear villagers and elders... this man
indiscriminately collects protection fees.

438
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,668
I'm taking him back to the court. Could
I trouble you to come and be witnesses?

439
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,090
This big brother's kung fu is amazing.
He dares to jump from such a height.

440
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:22,303
Boss... he forced you to give him a protection
fee. Come with me to the court and be a witness.

441
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,638
Be a witness?

442
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,014
I don't want to be like the theater boss,
startled by the wind all day long.

443
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:33,064
You were inside discussing martial arts. I
didn't see any fight... and don't want to know.

444
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:38,695
Over in America, everyone
has to be careful walking.

445
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,907
- Why?
- Because if you're not careful, you'll step on the gold.

446
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:45,493
- How can there be such a good thing?
- Not only that...

447
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:49,080
Wash your face by the river,
there's gold dust in the water.

448
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,851
- Is there really such a great place?
- Of course there's such a place.

449
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:56,171
Just one trip is better than struggling
for the rest of our lives here at home.

450
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,010
Come on, one sheet per person, take a look.
Don't say you weren't informed.

451
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:06,306
When you get there, you'll have to wear inky glasses,
because the dazzling gold will make your eyes blind.

452
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,559
If your eyes go blind, you won't be
able to see the gold much less pick it up.

453
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:17,567
Lamb that has lost his way, you should
get to know the Kingdom of Heaven.

454
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,572
- You're a publicist for San Francisco, too?
- Materials aren't eternal.

455
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:29,662
Only Jesus reveals the truth of life. You
should get close to him to witness life.

456
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:34,250
I caught a villain today.
Will Jesus be my witness?

457
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:06,658
Beware of thieves.
Beware of fire.

458
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:12,163
Big Brother...

459
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,749
- Big Brother, where is he?
- I'm here.

460
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:19,378
Everyone get ready.

461
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:38,314
- Master, aren't you hot?
- Well?

462
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,650
Idiot, so windy and
still drawing the fan?

463
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:45,579
- Is the court really holding the militia men in custody?
- I thought if they caught the suspects, they'd release them.

464
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,740
Master.

465
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,620
Who knew the court would call me a
suspect, with no right to bear witness?

466
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,874
Instead, they released
that Shahe named Hung.

467
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:03,172
- How long will the militia be shut down?
- Until someone testifies.

468
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,305
Master, look for Leung Foon.

469
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,850
- Foon? You know him?
- Yes.

470
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,979
You must be part of this.
What are you hiding from me?

471
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:23,860
I... Master, you
don't even believe me.

472
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,780
- So, I...
- I what? Say it.

473
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:31,451
Mas... Master!
The... there!

474
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,316
- Fire!
- Ah So, stay calm. Don't move!

475
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,716
Master!

476
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:49,593
Ah So!

477
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,703
- Master, what to do?
- The arrows were shot from the pharmacy roof.

478
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,270
Ah So, Master's
coming to save you!

479
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:02,732
Don... don't worry about me.
Gath... gather the things.

480
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:07,320
Ah Kai, we'll take weapons,
and go out to fight him.

481
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,657
Sai-Wing, you stay and put out the fire.
I'll go.

482
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,783
You go alone?

483
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,127
Fucking hell!

484
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:24,963
So, catch!

485
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,640
Slippery steps!

486
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,853
Lord Lau's fan?
It is.

487
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:56,202
- Wow! What a big fire on the roof!
- Bel... below it's... mor... more severe!

488
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,459
Someone's on the roof.
Shoot him!

489
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,554
It's Wong Fei-Hung, run.
Retreat...

490
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,322
Po Chi Lam's on fire.

491
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,959
If Po Chi Lam burns, it's gone.

492
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:52,401
- 13th Aunt, what are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture of Po Chi Lam.

493
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:55,625
- Fire's reaching our ass, and still taking pictures?
- You're blocking the sign.

494
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,973
Stand over a bit, otherwise
the camera can't see you.

495
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,558
Don't you want to
wait for Master?

496
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,311
The roof... is... on fire.

497
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,357
Hey, Ah So, look over here!

498
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:14,155
Ah Kai, you sit a
little to the right.

499
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:05,540
It was supposed to be with me, but I was
trying to photograph Po Chi Lam. So, I...

500
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,585
You're just like a foreign woman.
You don't understand the severity.

501
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:11,921
Playing with these
foreign toys all day.

502
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,971
In future, you're forbidden from
bringing these things into Po Chi Lam.

503
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:18,636
Otherwise, I'll
throw them all away.

504
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,442
The Lord Governor is here.

505
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:48,082
Master Wong, you open martial clubs, but in your spare
time specialise in sneaking around incense halls.

506
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:53,921
Helping common folk in the allocation of separatist
sites. Now your enemies come to your door.

507
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:59,510
You are to blame for the burning of Po Chi
Lam. You must repent and turn over a new leaf.

508
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,639
Lord Governor, opening a martial club is
not equal to setting up an incense hall.

509
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:09,145
If the court truly believes that practising
martial arts is breaking the law...

510
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:15,359
the tradition of martial arts our ancestors
left behind will henceforth become extinct.

511
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:20,198
If violent criminals attack us,
how do we defend ourselves then?

512
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,950
Won't this retreat be considered
a step back far and wide?

513
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,347
You couldn't even maintain Po Chi Lam, and yet you
want to lecture me about the military affairs?

514
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:31,000
Investigating the fire is
the court's responsibility.

515
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:35,004
- Then tell me, who set the fire?
- I don't know.

516
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,715
You don't know?
You're hiding the truth!

517
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,763
- Porky!
- Senior!

518
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,181
Sai-Wing!

519
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:50,061
- What are you doing? Get back inside!
- Master!

520
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,983
- Can I come in?
- Red-haired demon! What are you doing...?

521
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,902
- Sai-Wing!
- Master!

522
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:02,949
- If you do that again, don't call me master.
- Don't go.

523
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:07,578
You must be dissatisfied with Wong Fei-Hung. If you
have any complaints, don't hesitate to speak out.

524
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:17,338
Wong Fei-Hung, I know who burnt Po Chi Lam.
I can be your witness.

525
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,757
- Check if anyone's from Shahe.
- Right.

526
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,260
- Hey, are you from Shahe?
- I'm not!

527
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,136
You don't look
like it, let's go.

528
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:31,227
So many people. Hey, Big Brother, the
officers will catch you sooner or later.

529
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,230
Fuck!
That Jesus devil must've informed on me.

530
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,857
Big Brother, how about
returning to Shahe to hide?

531
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:40,987
No need. People are afraid of the court.
The court's afraid of the foreign devils.

532
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,239
Let's go find the most fierce devil.
Go!

533
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:46,867
Wait for me!

534
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:53,958
We want to see Mr Jackson.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

535
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:58,587
Fucking hell!
I don't speak foreign words.

536
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:04,969
Get on your knees. I beg you...
let us come in and see Mr Jackson.

537
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:11,976
Call together. Call together...
Mr Jackson. Jackson...

538
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:27,241
I only keep a dog if it can guard my door.
You're wanted by the court.

539
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:31,912
- What's the benefit of my helping you?
- I'm not afraid of being caught by the court.

540
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:37,668
It's my brothers, without a leader who knows how
to handle them, it's too much talent to waste.

541
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:43,591
You came all the way to Tangshan to seek wealth.
You're looking for so many coolies to go mining.

542
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:47,720
Why don't I send over some women for
you to take? Isn't that better?

543
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:51,974
No! Our government won't allow the
coolies to have wives or children.

544
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,769
They can't put down
roots in San Francisco.

545
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,647
I'm not talking about 'wives',
I'm talking about 'whores'.

546
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,691
I have as many as you want.

547
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:04,987
Worst is that Wong Fei-Hung,
he's always in the way.

548
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,782
Do you have the ability
to help me kill him?

549
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:24,423
- Wong Fei-Hung?
- Yes, yes!

550
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,217
I'll invite him to watch an opera.

551
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:31,972
If he doesn't die by my hand,
he'll die in the hands of the court.

552
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,586
Hey, the court's ordered the arrest
of the Shahe gang, Brother Wing.

553
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,654
Foon, how come you
show up only now?

554
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,133
I'm back in the troupe. Come, I'm inviting
you to see the opera. Come on, let's go.

555
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:35,161
- Hold on, hold on! I'll lock the door first.
- Come on, I'll help you.

556
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,622
- Hey, how will you get out?
- Oh, that's right.

557
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,676
Here, this is Lam Sai-Wing.
If you have any trouble, ask for his help.

558
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,137
Master Wong's apprentice.
You give me too much face.

559
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,198
I won't watch the opera for free,
I'll help you collect tickets.

560
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,582
I've always liked
being gatekeeper.

561
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,809
- Thank you...
- You're welcome...

562
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:28,964
Tickets, tickets...
Give me your tickets.

563
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:31,967
You have tickets, go in.

564
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:36,680
- Hey... do you have tickets?
- Tickets? You want my ticket?

565
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,849
Do you know who I am?
You look at this sign.

566
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:45,523
- He's 'Extraordinary' Ho, I'm Bak Yuk-Long.
- I'm Lam Sai-Wing, give me a ticket or get lost!

567
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,526
The opera's opening and
you want me to 'get lost'?

568
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,987
- OK, we'll get lost. You'll regret this!
- Go, go on, go...

569
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:54,823
Tickets, tickets...

570
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,426
Brother Wing, go in
and watch the opera.

571
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,610
- There's time, the stars haven't taken the stage.
- Thank you for your trouble.

572
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,290
Oh, have Extraordinary Ho
and Bak Yuk-Long arrived yet?

573
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:06,228
Arrived? They wanted to watch the opera
for free. I had to drive them away.

574
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:10,130
- You what? They're the stars!
- Ah, those people were actors?

575
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,840
Oh, no!
The opera can't be sung.

576
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,968
You stay here a while,
I'll quickly chase them back.

577
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,011
Tickets...

578
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,271
Oh, no! Master's here.
Could you watch for me? I'm taking a shit!

579
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,448
- Didn't expect the foreigners to invite you to the opera.
- Please...

580
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:43,622
13th Aunt.

581
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,166
Master Wong.

582
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:54,550
- Why regard me as an outsider?
- The rule of seniority can't change, not ever.

583
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,344
Fine, let's watch the opera.

584
00:59:57,428 --> 01:00:02,266
- Please...
- Please...

585
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:08,856
Brother Wing, Brother Wing!
Brother Wing, this time it's bad!

586
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,375
Master's here, I'm not
watching the opera.

587
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:14,153
My God! The stars have gone, you're
off again. What am I going to do?

588
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,614
- I can sing a few words.
- Huh? So what?

589
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:18,508
The two of us can go on
first, we'll save the show.

590
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:22,870
Hey, Master's arrival scared you into running.
You still dare to sing in front of him?

591
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,373
Silly, with painted faces
no one will recognize us.

592
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,251
Alright, let's take a chance.
We'll go backstage from here.

593
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:33,005
Without us this opera
wouldn't be sung at all.

594
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,716
- Is this OK?
- Aren't you Porky Wing?

595
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,802
- Who's Porky Wing? Let's go.
- Let's go.

596
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,763
The White Snake became a fat snake.

597
01:00:57,655 --> 01:01:01,241
Porky Wing!
Porky Wing!

598
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,098
- Amazing that you could recognize me.
- We recognize... that's great...

599
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,208
Hey, now we won't
have any pork to eat.

600
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,543
Sai-Wing, again!

601
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,934
- Preposterous!
- I told him to do this, give me face, OK?

602
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:28,769
Shut up!
Pack up and get lost!

603
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,646
You're forbidden to
return to the troupe.

604
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,692
Then I'll leave.
Brother Wing, I'll sell pork with you.

605
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,710
Take care!

606
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,554
Get down!

607
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,229
Seal off the passages at once.

608
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:16,275
- Come here, escort the foreigners out safely.
- Yes.

609
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,652
Boss, there's fighting outside.

610
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:26,160
Leung Foon, you're dead! It must be the Shahe
gang here to catch you. Quick, chase them!

611
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,496
13th Aunt, be careful!

612
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,212
Still attacking?

613
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,055
Don't shoot, there are
innocent people below.

614
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,098
Don't shoot!

615
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:25,260
My heir, my heir...

616
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,657
Lime powder, close your eyes!

617
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,872
Don't get up.

618
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:10,764
- Is it Wong Fei-Hung?
- Leave him, come on.

619
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,310
Quickly, protect his Lordship!

620
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:28,782
Come on!

621
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:32,035
Foreign gun!
Foreign gun...

622
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,122
Find a place to hide.

623
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:44,339
13th Aunt, you take this gun,
and hide with the missionary.

624
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,676
They came to deal with me.
It's dangerous to follow me. Go!

625
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,858
Come with me!

626
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,478
Master, catch the staff!

627
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,043
Master, let me help you!

628
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,341
A little bit weak.

629
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,638
- Master, let me help you.
- Who are you?

630
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,762
Hurry, go protect 13th Aunt,
I don't need your help.

631
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:44,834
Go!

632
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:46,669
Don't grab her!

633
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:19,494
Missionary!

634
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:26,126
Missionary...

635
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,714
Sai-Wing, quick,
come protect 13th Aunt!

636
01:07:36,178 --> 01:07:37,971
The murderers ran off stage.

637
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,636
Fuck you!
Come up if you have the guts.

638
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:04,371
Go to hell!

639
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:21,616
- Why did you try to assassinate me?
- Did you try to assassinate me or I you?

640
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,974
- Leung Foon?
- He's Leung Foon?

641
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:25,977
- He's Leung Foon.
- It's dangerous here, there are murderers inside.

642
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,189
Ask him about it, I'm going in.

643
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,275
- Hey, Ah Foon, what the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

644
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,559
As soon as he came in, he hit me without
thinking. I'm going to kill the bastard.

645
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:36,947
- Ah Foon!
- Don't move!

646
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,367
You told me not to move,
why did you hit me?

647
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,202
First we talk, then we fight.

648
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,538
Run for it!
Run!

649
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,962
Wong Fei-Hung, don't move!

650
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,424
- Lord Governor...
- You're not allowed to speak!

651
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:58,969
My Lord,
they left something behind.

652
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,641
'Militia wins honor,
kill all foreigners.'

653
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,103
Weren't all the militia
locked up by me?

654
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:14,067
How many of the militia
didn't you hand over?

655
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:17,612
Lord Governor, I'm being framed.

656
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,949
Don't trust him.
Those Shahe gangsters should be arrested.

657
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,576
What Shahe gangsters?

658
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:27,164
- You hit me for a second time.
- Get it straight before talking.

659
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:29,123
Get it straight?

660
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,314
This gangster is obviously
collecting protection fees.

661
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:38,425
- What? You're saying Master Wong charges protection?
- Isn't that right?

662
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:44,181
- Master Wong? He's not from Shahe?
- Who comes from Shahe?

663
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,144
You don't have to
explain anymore.

664
01:09:50,145 --> 01:09:53,940
Your remnants will be captured
by the court sooner or later.

665
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:56,252
But first, one must capture
the enemy leader to win.

666
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:59,279
I'm going to imprison you first,
then close down your Po Chi Lam.

667
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:01,323
Let's see how you can
still make trouble.

668
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,509
Many people were
hurt at the theater.

669
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:06,328
Let me help stop the bleeding,
then I'll go to the court with you.

670
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:12,167
OK, I'll allow you to save lives.
I'm sending troops to guard the door.

671
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:17,130
If there's any sound of activity, I'll
immediately have you beheaded in public.

672
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,469
Don't move,
the wound will bleed.

673
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,556
Ah So, bring the gold medicine.

674
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,354
What're you looking at?
Never seen a building closed?

675
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,987
Just close it, yeah?
Why are you carrying things away?

676
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,364
Take them back!

677
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,991
- You dare hit us?
- Get lost!

678
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,245
Are you free to
fight with people?

679
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:51,414
Master, they're looting.
I'm getting everything back.

680
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:54,751
So that's how it is?
You want to fight? I'll fight with you.

681
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,129
- OK, together.
- Halt! I'll fight you.

682
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,758
- Master, you fight with me?
- Where do you want to be hit?

683
01:11:02,384 --> 01:11:03,843
Is it there?
Is it there?

684
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,765
You want me taken
to court earlier?

685
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:11,151
No? Then don't prevent
me from saving people.

686
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,186
Master!

687
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,750
You really exploited this opportunity
and took advantage of us.

688
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,776
Don't think we won't arrest
you if you get in the way.

689
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,573
This Porky guy seems to be smart.
That way he gets to escape his master.

690
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:38,253
Hit me.
You sure can stand it.

691
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,858
'Uncle' Cheng!
'Uncle' Cheng!

692
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,220
Can't stop the bleeding.
Quick, get the emergency medicine.

693
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:06,531
Emergency medicine!

694
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,135
He's stopped breathing.
Remember to inform his family.

695
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:38,396
Ah So...

696
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,289
Fei-Hung!

697
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,667
What's that mark?

698
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:06,174
It's Arabic numerals. 'Jackson'.
Could it be the name of Jackson's ship?

699
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,179
Don't be afraid.
I'm Wong Fei-Hung.

700
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:14,599
You've been hurt.
If you move, it will affect the wound.

701
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:20,688
You're... Master Wong?
Help me, help me...

702
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:24,984
Get up, get up first.
'Uncle', where did you come from?

703
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:28,863
- San Francisco.
- San Francisco?

704
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:36,579
We men were on a ship crossing the ocean.
Midway there was sickness, but no medicine.

705
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:40,166
<i>Many men were thrown into
the ocean along the way.</i>

706
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:48,842
<i>In San Francisco, we were beaten, and
branded on the body just like pigs.</i>

707
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:55,140
Actually, we were tricked by the Chinese
comprador into signing a contract.

708
01:13:55,765 --> 01:14:00,437
Paid the fare, paid for the meals.
It's unclear how much we owe them.

709
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,733
Many men tried to escape,
but they were beaten to death.

710
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:09,154
I ground my teeth to
come back to Tangshan.

711
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:14,284
I... I... Master Wong...

712
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:18,746
Uncle, don't you worry.
You're back in Tangshan.

713
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:22,584
Yes, rest a while.
I'll think of a solution for you.

714
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,962
I'll take you home as soon as possible.
You rest first.

715
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:33,720
Ah Kai... don't make public that he
signed a contract with the foreigners.

716
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,139
- The court will arrest him.
- I understand.

717
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:43,313
It's better to go to San Francisco
than struggle here all my life.

718
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:46,858
Don't miss a good thing.
Don't miss the opportunity.

719
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:50,695
Come, take a look.
A flyer for you.

720
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:54,240
Hey, is this for San Francisco?
How do I go?

721
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,326
Just take a look and see.

722
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,014
Is it the San Francisco
the newspaper speaks of?

723
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:04,667
Yes, you want to go? Pay 300 silver dragons per
capita export fee and 40 taels for a ship ticket.

724
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:07,438
Provide your own luggage and rations,
and sign a three-year contract.

725
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:08,463
Almost two years' wages?

726
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:10,173
- Eh? You don't have money?
- No.

727
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,218
You've no money to go to San Francisco?
Next. Don't obstruct others.

728
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:17,472
You want a flyer? Hey, San Francisco,
San Francisco... plenty gold to be picked.

729
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,366
Hey, seems like there's a
duel over at the factory.

730
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,518
- A duel?
- Let's go.

731
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:25,522
Hey, don't leave!

732
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:33,780
You're a northerner performing martial
arts in front of my in-law's door.

733
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,491
I told you to go,
but you injured my apprentice.

734
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,911
- What's your name?
- Yim Chun-Tung.

735
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:11,776
Our family's Seven Swords method
has fought in nineteen provinces.

736
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:15,738
This time, I act as host, and
will permit you three moves.

737
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,450
Please advise.

738
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,764
Second move.

739
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:11,586
Master Ngok, it's not yet three
moves, and you draw your sword?

740
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:16,424
I fear another move would prove fatal.
Enough already.

741
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,216
Don't go!

742
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,540
Plot against me?

743
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:17,568
Iron Cloth?

744
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:25,493
I've granted you three moves.
Give it up.

745
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,618
There must be a hole.

746
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:50,828
- Why are you following me?
- My Name's Leung Foon, I come from Meixian.

747
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,389
Here in the capital there are
people from all walks of life.

748
01:19:52,413 --> 01:19:55,208
My kung fu isn't perfect.
I've been pursued to the end of my rope.

749
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:59,545
I get beaten like a street rat
when trying to making a living.

750
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:02,924
Your kung fu's so good.
Take me as an apprentice.

751
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,344
Good kung fu...

752
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,681
It's not your place.
Likewise, I'm at the end of my rope.

753
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:29,909
Master... are you hungry?

754
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:34,288
First, find a place to avoid the rain.
I'll think of something.

755
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:40,837
Hey... give me a chicken leg.

756
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:45,883
I won't eat if it's
not good food...

757
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:56,227
Gentlemen, come in
and rest a while.

758
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:01,107
The soup's too salty.
Don't drink it. Let's go.

759
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:08,239
The soup's too salty...
and bitter.

760
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,996
Hey, why are you
stealing my bowl?

761
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:22,295
- Gentlemen, come in, have a drink.
- Come up, gentlemen, I'll sing to you.

762
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,213
Master, have a bowl of soup.

763
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:43,024
Two men drinking a bowl of soup.
How immoral!

764
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:49,113
- Godmother, do you want me to call out Ah GAN?
- Drive them away.

765
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:55,536
I'll make a name in Foshan, see
who dares look down on me then.

766
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:57,872
Yes, you must make a name.

767
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:01,918
Who's the most able fighter in the capital?
Is it Wong Fei-Hung?

768
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,630
- Fei-Hung!
- 13th Aunt.

769
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:55,304
You're right, Tangshan must change.
You can't beat a gun with a fist.

770
01:22:56,806 --> 01:23:01,060
I've become a prisoner and may
be forced to stand and fight.

771
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:05,314
- You take care.
- Fei-Hung, I'll be waiting for you.

772
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:12,780
It's no use. If you do that,
even if I die, I won't die content.

773
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:16,826
You won't.

774
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:25,626
I'm a man of flesh and blood.
Go back.

775
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,255
Sai-Wing, he...

776
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:43,227
- Sai-Wing, it's raining hard. Go inside.
- Master didn't tell me, I daren't go in.

777
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,562
Sai-Wing.

778
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:51,318
- Go inside Po Chi Lam.
- Master.

779
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:54,155
Come, come in.

780
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:03,664
I, I...
Master, allow me.

781
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,604
Ah So, you...

782
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,601
The rain's coming down heavier.

783
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:09,105
This place is closed.
Go!

784
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:24,453
I'm Shandong's Iron
Cloth, Yim Chun-Tung.

785
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:31,418
I've come to Po Chi Lam to find Wong
Fei-Hung; to learn from Master Wong.

786
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,463
May I ask, which of
you is Wong Fei-Hung?

787
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,637
- Master, a challenger's come.
- Sai-Wing, pour some tea.

788
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,181
- Master!
- Pour tea!

789
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,101
Please...

790
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:51,063
- Ah Kai, go and take care of the patients.
- Alright.

791
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:57,486
Please sit.

792
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,409
Still haven't put
down the umbrella?

793
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,209
Please, some tea.

794
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,007
- Leung Foon, what the hell are you doing?
- Leung Foon?

795
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:26,223
The martial arts world's stories of
Master Wong's Hung Fist are well-known.

796
01:26:26,307 --> 01:26:29,852
I hear Master Wong's Shadowless Kick
and Cross Fist are tremendous.

797
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,189
I, Yim Chun-Tung, intend to
establish a school in Foshan.

798
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:35,149
Today, I come to you for a duel.

799
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:39,987
To let all the local elders of Foshan know
that my Yim family martial arts is unmatched.

800
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:44,158
I'm being watched by the court.
I'm afraid our meeting could implicate you.

801
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:47,661
The future is long. Forgive me,
I can't accompany you today.

802
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:49,914
Martial arts practitioner?
You gutless old woman!

803
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:51,957
Master Yim!

804
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,977
I have too many patients here.
This isn't the place for a contest.

805
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:00,049
- Leung Foon!
- Sai-Wing, Ah Kai!

806
01:27:00,174 --> 01:27:01,926
You want to be kicked out again?

807
01:27:29,954 --> 01:27:31,413
- Don't just stand there.
- Master?

808
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,499
Take all the patients
to the back.

809
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,460
Uncle, I'll help you in.
They're about to fight.

810
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:38,879
Hey! What are you
doing with my patient?

811
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:40,924
Helping him in, lest he
gets beaten by my master.

812
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:43,652
How arrogant? If it hadn't been for
my master, I'd have beaten you up!

813
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:44,927
- You won't let go?
- I won't.

814
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,304
- Let him go! You let go!
- You let go!

815
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:50,766
- Fuck! Leung Foon!
- What?

816
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:51,969
You're still fooling around?

817
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:16,810
Yim, stop fighting!

818
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:22,441
If you keep fighting,
I'll shoot!

819
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:26,737
Hey, don't hurt my master.
Give it to me!

820
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,502
- Master! Master, are you alright?
- Master!

821
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,691
I, Iron Cloth Yim Chun-Tung,
am not afraid of western guns.

822
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:08,529
Wong Fei-Hung, today I won too easily.
It doesn't count.

823
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:09,964
Tomorrow, we rematch in the street.

824
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:14,243
Don't come, and the three words 'Wong
Fei-Hung' will be written on my soles.

825
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,910
Leung Foon!

826
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,622
You fucking bastard!

827
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:36,014
You traitor.

828
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:48,986
Speak Chinese... fake foreign devil.

829
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:59,413
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I suddenly slipped.

830
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,958
He wounded the guards.
The court will put this on my head.

831
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:08,338
Soldiers will be coming. Ah Wing, Ah Kai;
take some silver taels for travel expenses.

832
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:11,884
13th Aunt, go wake the 'uncle'
who came back from San Francisco.

833
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,220
Why are you still standing there?
Go one at a time.

834
01:31:15,429 --> 01:31:17,014
You go with the uncle.

835
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,268
Ah So, I didn't teach you kung fu.
You're the most disadvantaged.

836
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:23,937
You don't have to wait.

837
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:26,940
- Just go.
- Mast...

838
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,903
- You take care.
- I'll see you off.

839
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,338
Hey, don't act recklessly!

840
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:52,758
- Master.
- Don't be impulsive.

841
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,801
Don't you worry, this
time I'll do as I'm told.

842
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:58,055
Ah Kai, tell 13th Aunt
to go with the 'uncle'.

843
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:01,659
I released the tiger back to the mountain so as to
catch the militia's remnants in one fell swoop.

844
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:02,683
- Search!
- Yes!

845
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:08,232
Wait! Inside are seriously injured patients.
Unable to move, they had to stay here.

846
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:11,155
I hope your Lordship doesn't disturb
them, lest their conditions worsen.

847
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:15,280
That's telling me not to go inside.
Obviously you're hiding something.

848
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:18,092
I just want to take advantage of you
unguarded to come and arrest people.

849
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:21,828
Come, see how many
militia there are here.

850
01:32:21,954 --> 01:32:24,206
- Search for me!
- Yes!

851
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:28,293
Someone's climbing the wall.

852
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:33,966
Back off!

853
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,554
So, hurry up and go!

854
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,641
- Bring the fugitives back.
- Yes!

855
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:46,353
- Sai-Wing, still not doing it?
- Doing what, Master?

856
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,442
Sai-Wing, I told you to do it.

857
01:32:53,193 --> 01:32:56,488
- Manchu dog!
- You curse me? How impudent!

858
01:32:57,114 --> 01:32:58,699
Overlord Lifts Cauldron!

859
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,662
- You're really fighting?
- Yes!

860
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,756
Where's my gun?

861
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:30,480
Where are you going?
Running? Come back!

862
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:34,234
Cross Fist!
Shadowless Kick!

863
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:36,320
- Go after them!
- Yes!

864
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,787
You don't have to go.
The man you want to arrest is here.

865
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:48,707
- Separate and rush him.
- OK.

866
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:53,128
This way.

867
01:33:54,338 --> 01:33:56,178
Hold the bamboo pole,
the others break through.

868
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:25,911
Wong Fei-Hung, this time we're going to convict
you of plotting rebellion. You're a dead man!

869
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:30,666
My Lord, I'll come back
to the court with you.

870
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:34,044
- Ah Kai!
- Master?

871
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:37,214
Take liniment and help Big Brother
apply it to the bailiffs' bruises.

872
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:44,054
Our Po Chi Lam liniment is most famous.
How many do you have here?

873
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,933
- My Lord, are you alright?
- You good-for-nothing!

874
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,813
Uncle, we're almost there.
Hold on.

875
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:56,191
With the western guns,
we can get whatever we want.

876
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,694
We need to find girls
for the foreign devil.

877
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:01,113
Sha... Shahe gang!

878
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:04,574
Go!

879
01:35:06,702 --> 01:35:07,786
A woman!

880
01:35:12,332 --> 01:35:13,458
Let go of Ah So!

881
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,134
Uncle, go by yourself first.

882
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:24,761
Don't let her go!

883
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:29,015
Go!

884
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:32,060
Let her go!

885
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:35,856
Uncle, take care of yourself.
There's too many, don't worry about me.

886
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:51,787
Die!

887
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:54,291
Go!

888
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:58,378
- Let me go!
- Go!

889
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:05,010
There's another one over there.
Grab him!

890
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:07,053
Catch him! Come back!

891
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,683
Fucking bastard!
You're just going to help me now?

892
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:20,734
- Punching Po Chi Lam.
- Kicking Wong Fei-Hung?

893
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,779
Master's been challenged.

894
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,783
Hey, tell your aunt not to cook yet.
We'll just wait here and watch.

895
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:32,913
- When do you think Master will come?
- Just wait and see.

896
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,019
Open your mouth wider.

897
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,442
Open the door.

898
01:37:06,404 --> 01:37:07,864
Get lost, still playing?

899
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:12,702
Let's go!

900
01:37:14,955 --> 01:37:18,166
Shoot me?
I'm sending you to San Francisco tonight!

901
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,876
You hate me, don't you?

902
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:24,256
I want to taste your flesh.
Do you want to add some seasoning?

903
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:34,182
When the time comes... and you're serving those
dirty, smelly yokels, you're going to miss me.

904
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,102
- Take her to my room.
- Yes!

905
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,273
Big Brother, the master who
beat Wong Fei-Hung has come.

906
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:46,945
Invite him in. That's great, from
now on we'll be the kings of Foshan.

907
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:53,243
Master...

908
01:37:53,326 --> 01:37:57,414
You must now recognise him as your senior.
What can you do for him?

909
01:37:57,497 --> 01:38:00,834
So, you're our senior?
Hey, call him Senior.

910
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:03,503
- Senior...
- Bullshit!

911
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:09,217
- OK, you flatter me...
- Remember, he's Senior.

912
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:13,096
Master, I have something to do tonight.
Don't take offence.

913
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:15,724
Tomorrow, I'll talk to you
about opening the school.

914
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,435
Bring out the gift.

915
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:27,277
Master Yim, this money
is to open your school.

916
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,822
Needless to say, Yim's Fist
will sweep across Foshan.

917
01:38:30,906 --> 01:38:33,450
Come... let's raise a toast to Master.

918
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:36,995
- Good... Master Yim.
- Cheers...

919
01:39:37,931 --> 01:39:39,641
Don't move!
What are you doing?

920
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:45,897
Master Wong, we brothers
all admire you as a person.

921
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,983
We know you were
harmed by bad guys.

922
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,403
Master Wong, we've
decided to let you out.

923
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,447
If anything happens, we
brothers will deal with it.

924
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:57,117
Master Wong, please...

925
01:39:57,742 --> 01:39:59,786
That's great!
Let's go, Master.

926
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:04,040
Master?

927
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,636
The state has national laws.
What right do I have to change the rules?

928
01:40:08,712 --> 01:40:12,007
- Go, Master!
- Master Wong, go!

929
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:16,594
I won't.
My Lord, I appreciate your good intention.

930
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,889
- W... W... Wong...
- Master Wong's over there.

931
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:23,143
Master! Mast... Master!

932
01:40:23,268 --> 01:40:26,521
Master, you're still not leaving?
Ah So!

933
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:30,608
- Mast... Mast... Mast...
- Ah So? Speak slowly.

934
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:34,005
Master... I took the 'uncle' out with 13th
Aunt. On the way we ran into the Shahe gang.

935
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:36,448
They started by killing the 'uncle',
then snatched 13th Aunt.

936
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:39,117
- Find a way to save her.
- What?

937
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:42,203
Master, hurry up and save her.

938
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:48,043
- Porky Wing, I'll send a few militia to help.
- Good.

939
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:49,961
- Release them.
- Yes.

940
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:55,842
- Ah So, how come you can now talk plainly?
- I was rehearsing... all the way here...

941
01:41:12,192 --> 01:41:13,902
Isn't that Wong Fei-Hung?

942
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:20,909
They're all militia.

943
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:46,434
Master, your kung fu's so powerful. Even
Wong Fei-Hung wasn't up to fighting you.

944
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:49,813
You have some moves to show us?

945
01:41:50,605 --> 01:41:53,024
A couple of moves,
just a couple.

946
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:15,505
Wow!
That's great...

947
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:52,083
You bitch, you're dead!

948
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:15,315
Great! Great...

949
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:43,801
That's enough, Master.
Don't show off!

950
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:53,228
Master, don't show off.

951
01:43:54,312 --> 01:43:55,647
What the hell?

952
01:43:55,772 --> 01:43:59,359
Master, this money is dubious.
Think clearly about accepting it.

953
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:03,238
What? You're insulting us? What are
you doing? What do you mean by that?

954
01:44:03,363 --> 01:44:09,702
- You've embarrassed our Shahe gang!
- Foon, in this world, what isn't unbearable?

955
01:44:11,037 --> 01:44:18,586
Even so-called righteous men slaughter dogs.
Most important now is to achieve fame in Foshan.

956
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:23,549
At that time, we can stand up and
preside over justice for the world.

957
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:29,639
Just wait.
Leung Foon, pick up the money.

958
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:49,158
Pick it up!
Pick it up!

959
01:44:51,452 --> 01:44:54,163
Pick it up...

960
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:25,653
- You really think you're our senior?
- You're just a tramp!

961
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,280
Leung Foon!

962
01:45:49,886 --> 01:45:54,140
Become famous?
Just wait, just wait...

963
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:25,755
Senior!
Senior!

964
01:46:26,422 --> 01:46:27,715
You rapist!

965
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:34,138
Eat shit!

966
01:46:42,688 --> 01:46:47,610
13th Aunt, 13th Aunt...
Wake up, wake up...

967
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:51,572
- You beast, don't touch me!
- Don't make a noise, I'm saving you.

968
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,708
Leung Foon, it's you?
There's too many coming!

969
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:03,835
Go quickly.

970
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:20,768
Grab that woman!

971
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:40,163
Leung Foon, keep fighting...
and I'll kill this woman.

972
01:47:41,873 --> 01:47:43,875
Be our senior?
Go to hell!

973
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,257
- Master, they're inside.
- Let's go see.

974
01:47:51,966 --> 01:47:53,092
What's the matter?

975
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:59,056
Master, it wasn't long before Leung Foon came in,
saw my beautiful wife, and tried to seduce her.

976
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:01,601
- I'm not...
- Shut up!

977
01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:10,610
Leung Foon, you brute!
Admit your mistake to your junior.

978
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:17,116
- Yim, we met at Po Chi Lam...
- Still talking, you whore? Go!

979
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:20,536
Want to rebel?

980
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:24,457
Don't be so blind.
She's not his wife.

981
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:27,710
- Blind?
- She's a relative of Wong Fei-Hung.

982
01:48:29,712 --> 01:48:30,712
Wong Fei-Hung?

983
01:48:36,886 --> 01:48:39,764
- Leung Foon wants to escape.
- Escape?

984
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,125
You're daring!

985
01:49:17,885 --> 01:49:21,138
- Don't go!
- Grab him!

986
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:34,003
- Careful!
- Yes, Big Brother!

987
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:36,339
- It hurts.
- Yes, yes...

988
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:43,137
Master, it's they who are driving me out.
Sooner or later, they'll do this to you.

989
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:44,597
You mustn't trust them!

990
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:47,802
One who doesn't trust his fellow students
still wants to invoke the name Wong?

991
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:52,396
What's up? Distressed?
Can't watch anymore?

992
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:59,737
If you let him go, I promise
I'll do what you want.

993
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,866
Is he worth your sacrifice?
So low as to bargain with me?

994
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:08,371
Fuck your ancestors!
So you're Wong Fei-Hung's woman?

995
01:51:11,791 --> 01:51:17,838
When I'm done messing with your face, Wong
Fei-Hung won't ever be able to find you.

996
01:51:20,675 --> 01:51:22,760
The woman you captured today,
where is she?

997
01:51:23,844 --> 01:51:28,641
- Big Brother! Big Brother, Wong Fei-Hung is here!
- Wong Fei-Hung?

998
01:51:31,686 --> 01:51:33,187
- Quick, get the weapons.
- Yes!

999
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:36,232
- Take out the western guns.
- OK!

1000
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,651
Go, put the women on the ship.

1001
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:42,405
Master, Wong Fei-Hung's here to attack
our base. I need you to stand up to him.

1002
01:51:42,488 --> 01:51:43,489
Don't worry.

1003
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:47,785
- Leung Foon!
- Let's go!

1004
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:49,787
13th Aunt! 13th Aunt!

1005
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:51,414
Come on!

1006
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:55,042
Hey, let's watch Master
Yim catch Wong Fei-Hung.

1007
01:52:07,388 --> 01:52:11,267
- I'll handle this, you split up to find 13th Aunt.
- Yes.

1008
01:52:13,102 --> 01:52:14,687
Wong Fei-Hung!

1009
01:52:16,021 --> 01:52:20,234
Master Yim, win or lose the contest,
there's no need to make a fuss.

1010
01:52:22,445 --> 01:52:24,822
Today you've got no
excuse not to fight.

1011
01:52:30,995 --> 01:52:31,995
I'll take you on.

1012
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:34,683
They're down there.

1013
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:40,648
- Hard qigong?
- Only one of us can get out.

1014
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,151
How does this western gun work?

1015
01:54:15,683 --> 01:54:17,518
Don't be afraid, we have guns.

1016
01:54:54,972 --> 01:54:59,018
You're not able to fight?
Come out, come out...

1017
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,066
Master, let me help you.

1018
01:55:08,569 --> 01:55:10,029
Porky Wing!
Porky Wing?

1019
01:55:21,999 --> 01:55:23,125
Is there anymore above?

1020
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:50,736
Ah So, it's you?
Quick, come up and let me down. Hurry up!

1021
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:54,556
13th Aunt's been taken on board by members
of the Shahe gang. Hurry up and save her.

1022
01:55:56,659 --> 01:55:58,845
13th Aunt's been taken on board
by members of the Shahe gang.

1023
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:03,374
Hey, don't go! You haven't let me down yet!
Toothbrush So!

1024
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:10,839
My Lord.

1025
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:57,011
My Lord, it's too dangerous here.
You better hide first. Come on.

1026
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:06,562
Militia brothers, charge in!

1027
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:13,902
- Senior, how's it going?
- Ah Kai, I'll help Master, you save 13th Aunt.

1028
01:57:14,028 --> 01:57:18,532
No, I won't. I'll stay here and
help Master. You go save 13th Aunt.

1029
01:57:18,657 --> 01:57:21,243
I'm senior, I say forget it.
You go quick...

1030
01:57:33,088 --> 01:57:35,448
Neither of you need stay behind.
Just go and save 13th Aunt.

1031
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,259
Still here?

1032
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,559
Wong Fei-Hung!

1033
02:00:31,767 --> 02:00:33,769
This technique is self-defence.

1034
02:00:34,519 --> 02:00:36,647
Is this the Yim family's
martial arts also?

1035
02:00:37,064 --> 02:00:39,733
The world is dangerous,
one must guard against it.

1036
02:00:42,194 --> 02:00:45,906
Hurry up, the ship is leaving.
Take them aboard.

1037
02:00:47,032 --> 02:00:51,870
- Let's go, bitch!
- Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung, it's 13th Aunt! Fei-Hung!

1038
02:01:03,966 --> 02:01:07,803
Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung,
it's 13th Aunt! Fei-Hung!

1039
02:01:08,887 --> 02:01:13,725
- Take her aboard. Let's go, bitch!
- Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung!

1040
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:21,608
Mr Jackson, Master Wong is here!

1041
02:01:22,442 --> 02:01:23,860
Wong Fei-Hung, go deal with him.

1042
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:26,238
The ship's over there.

1043
02:01:27,614 --> 02:01:31,159
Hung, take all the women
down to the ship's hold.

1044
02:01:41,795 --> 02:01:43,964
Go down.
Hurry up!

1045
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:07,362
Over... over there.

1046
02:03:37,244 --> 02:03:39,246
Wong... Wong Fei...

1047
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,044
Master Yim, our fight is done.

1048
02:03:53,969 --> 02:03:56,346
Master Wong, be careful there!

1049
02:04:02,436 --> 02:04:06,273
Wong Fei-Hung, where are you?
We haven't finished the fight yet.

1050
02:04:15,449 --> 02:04:18,368
Master!

1051
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:34,384
- I'm Iron Cloth...
- Master Yim! Master Yim!

1052
02:04:40,724 --> 02:04:44,936
- Master Yim! Master Yim!
- Wong Fei-Hung...

1053
02:04:45,061 --> 02:04:52,152
- Master Yim!
- Our kung fu is no match for their guns.

1054
02:05:05,415 --> 02:05:07,083
You fucking bastard!

1055
02:06:13,024 --> 02:06:15,235
Wong Fei-Hung, don't run!

1056
02:06:18,863 --> 02:06:20,240
Don't shoot!

1057
02:07:42,364 --> 02:07:45,200
- Leung Foon!
- Kill him!

1058
02:07:50,664 --> 02:07:51,664
Be careful!

1059
02:08:09,766 --> 02:08:13,853
The great Wong Fei-Hung.
Come over if you have the guts.

1060
02:08:14,896 --> 02:08:16,940
Fei-Hung, he's got
a gun on his knife.

1061
02:08:17,023 --> 02:08:19,567
- Be careful, don't fall into his trap.
- Shut up!

1062
02:08:37,711 --> 02:08:42,382
Bitch, you drew them here. I'll burn
your face so there's no need to fight.

1063
02:08:42,465 --> 02:08:44,426
Wong Fei-Hung, are you
quicker than my gun?

1064
02:08:49,723 --> 02:08:51,474
I'll burn you to death!

1065
02:08:57,647 --> 02:08:59,149
Let me go!

1066
02:09:28,386 --> 02:09:33,933
My Lord... Mr Jackson and the Shahe gang conspired
to snatch women and sell them to San Francisco.

1067
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:35,852
My Lord, help us.

1068
02:09:36,853 --> 02:09:40,523
Brothers of the Shahe gang,
help me capture all the women.

1069
02:09:40,899 --> 02:09:42,233
There will be rewards.

1070
02:09:42,317 --> 02:09:45,597
Under the law, an ambassador must be turned
over to the Qing Empire for punishment.

1071
02:09:49,866 --> 02:09:52,702
- You're now violating international law.
- Put the guns down!

1072
02:09:52,827 --> 02:09:56,456
- Why won't it 'bang'?
- Did we forget to put the iron balls in?

1073
02:09:57,373 --> 02:10:00,210
If you don't put the
guns down, I'll kill him!

1074
02:10:00,293 --> 02:10:01,294
Put the guns down!

1075
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:19,103
Although this is a restricted area,
you've hurt an imperial ambassador.

1076
02:10:19,187 --> 02:10:20,581
How will you explain
it to the government?

1077
02:10:20,605 --> 02:10:23,024
Chinese ghosts.
I can't let anyone go.

1078
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:30,365
If all the dead are rebels against the US flag,
what do I have to explain to the government?

1079
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:40,333
- Fucking bastards!
- You don't have to explain!

1080
02:10:55,974 --> 02:10:58,434
- My Lord...
- Wow, you dare jump so high?

1081
02:10:58,518 --> 02:11:00,937
A trivial matter,
a minor accomplishment.

1082
02:11:02,564 --> 02:11:05,942
Thank you, My Lord...

1083
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:08,570
This time, Master Wong and
the court worked together.

1084
02:11:08,653 --> 02:11:10,130
- You're welcome...
- Now thank Master Wong.

1085
02:11:10,154 --> 02:11:11,739
Thanks, Master Wong!

1086
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,883
Tangshan has changed so much.
How can I deal with it?

1087
02:11:30,008 --> 02:11:34,012
San Francisco?
Is there a 'San Francisco' in this world?

1088
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:39,309
If there's really a 'Gold Mountain' in the world,
why are these foreign ships coming to our harbor?

1089
02:11:40,435 --> 02:11:43,396
Maybe we're already
standing on Gold Mountain?

1090
02:12:12,592 --> 02:12:15,637
<i>After this cup of tea,
you'll be my master.</i>

1091
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:18,765
<i>But 13th Aunt and I now
have a close relationship.</i>

1092
02:12:18,848 --> 02:12:20,892
<i>We'll see each other
all the time.</i>

1093
02:12:20,975 --> 02:12:25,480
<i>If one day she marries me,
will you call me 13th Uncle?</i>

1094
02:12:25,605 --> 02:12:30,485
<i>I'll be your elder.
As senior, you have to serve me.</i>

1095
02:12:31,361 --> 02:12:33,655
Leung Foon,
what are you thinking?

1096
02:12:35,156 --> 02:12:36,741
Drink tea, Master!
