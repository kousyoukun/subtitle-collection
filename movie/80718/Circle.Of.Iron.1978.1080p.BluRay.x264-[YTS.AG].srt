in a book he guards.

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,199
What do you know of Zetan

52
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,201
and his Book of Enlightenment?

53
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,453
Only that it's a book.

54
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,416
That it contains
all the wisdom of the world.

Cord, he who is chosen
to find and defeat Zetan

Why have all the others you've sent
never returned?

Do you know anything about this book?
Know what it is?

Do you, uh, think
it could be important?

Is that the secret?

148

The monkey
tried to circle you-

149
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:59,111
and you wouldn't let him-
you kept turning.

150
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,781
The way of the monkey
is to play the fool.

151
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:07,244
While you laugh at his antics,
he bites you from behind.

152
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:13,792
Unmask his ego, and you expose a
coward disguised as a monkey.

153
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,794
I'll study them.

154
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,172
I'll watch them
very carefully.

155

00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,962
Morthond, what was
the first trial? Where?

169
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,340
Monkey.

170
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,888
Cord. The medallion.

171
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,890
Take it

172
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,954
How can I help you, Morthond?

173
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,375
Help me die with honor.

My name is Cord.

Where is your begging bowl?

I'm not here to beg.

Hmm?
No school.

I want to find Zetan.
[shouts]

that to find him

you must fight me, huh?

in peace.

213
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,601
I don't want to go back.

214
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:13,480
And I don't want to fight you
unless I have to to find Zetan.

215

Zetan

To reach him,

220
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:37,504
you must first pass through...

me!

222
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,802
What if I just
walk around you?

223
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:52,686
That is not
in the order of things!

224
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,648
Yes,

225
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:59,860
if I am your trial

226
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:04,823
then I am your trial.

227
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:10,704
You cannot walk around me.

228
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:12,706
Then <i>I'll</i> have to fight you.

229

Yes.

[screeching, chattering]

232
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,514
Now tell me the way
to Zetan.

233
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,892
Embrace the west wind

234
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:41,062
until you come to a wilderness.

235
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:44,941
Look for a rose there.

236
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,361
Look for a rose?

237
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,363
Is that the second trial?

238
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,784
You asked the way to Zetan.

239
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,996
Are there others ahead of me?

240
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,126
You are the first to pass me.

241
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:12,510
But other seekers
have other trials.

242
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,395
Am I a beggar
with a begging bowl now?

243
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,731
I put you in my bowl!

[gentle ﬂute music]

00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,640
Can I help you?

247
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,642
To do what?

248
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:45,270
To get out of this-
Why?

249
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,732
Who's torturing you this way?

250
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,817
No one.

251
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,113
Isn't that barrel
filled with oil?

252
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:59,451
Of course.
I filled it myself.

253
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:03,288
You? I filled it myself,
and I got in it myself.

254
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,540
I've been in here ten years.

255
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:07,250
But Why?

256
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,632
To rid myself
of the bottom half of me.

257
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:19,387
There's very little left of it now.

258
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,894
Your legs look like seaweed.

259
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,979
I hope so

260
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:33,693
That thing- that terrible
thing between my legs-

261
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,862
it's almost gone now,
isn't it?

262
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:43,536
A mere pimple.
Good.

263
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,790
It'll go altogether soon,
I hope.

264
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,129
Ten years!

265
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,424
How do you live
without eating?

266
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,135
My family. They bring me

267
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,262
a little rice, a little water.

268
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,224
Your family?

269
00:37:04,307 --> 00:37:07,310
They know you're dissolving
yourself in oil?

270
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,438
They weren't too happy
about it at first.

271
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,524
Especially my wife.

272
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,778
Now she understands.

273
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,824
But why would you want to-

274
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,910
Ah.

275
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,996
You could have taken
a vow of chastity, like I have.

276
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,917
I took a vow of chastity.
I took ten vows- a hundred.

277
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,004
How can a man be
a holy man

278
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:38,383
when that terrible thing
attaches him to the earth?

279
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,511
I got rid of my money,
I shed my clothes,

280
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:44,264
I ate a spoonful of rice
each day,

281
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,225
and my mind began to soar.

282
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,978
I felt the universe.

283
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:53,189
I was the universe.

284
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:58,736
And then, that terrible thing
summoned me.

285
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,614
“Hello!” it cried.

286
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:04,701
“Think of the pleasure!”

287
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,079
Several times,
I grabbed a knife.

288
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:11,416
I intended to rid myself of it
once and for all.

289
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:17,547
But I-
I was a coward.

290
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:25,597
Then... I found a way!

291
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,643
I would dissolve it away

292
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:33,438
and the legs
that carried it along.

293
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:37,317
Oh, you are obviously
mentally disturbed.

294
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,861
Mm-hmm.
You should have seen a doctor:</i>

295
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,905
I am a doctor.

296
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,955
You took a vow of chastity.

297
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,957
Yes.

298
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,043
You won't keep it.

299
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,379
Come in here with me.

300
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:03,176
There's plenty of room.
We'll keep each other company.

301
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,970
I'm sorry, but I must go.
I'm looking for someone.

302
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,139
Who?
Zetan.

303
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,351
Again Zetan!

304
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:14,187
They all come around
asking about Zetan!

305
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:17,607
There is no answer in Zetan.
[laughing]

306
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,777
The answer is
in here with me.

won't melt it off, cut it off!

dreams are, it will ruin them!

309

It's like a sword,
that terrible thing!

It will-
it will cut you to pieces!

Peace.

Don't wish it on me!

The sun will never
rise or set.

660
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,833
My goal is Zetan.

661
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,918
Ah, yes.

662
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:25,841
At daybreak then.

663
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:27,885
Along the beach.

664
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:30,512
No.

665
01:21:30,596 --> 01:21:32,514
Now.

666
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,848
[rhythmic drums]

667
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:53,679
[snarls]

668
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:55,097

669
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:46,064

[snarls]

671
01:23:47,482 --> 01:23:48,567
Huh?

672
01:23:57,451 --> 01:23:58,744
[snarls]

01:24:05,626 --> 01:24:07,252

[snarls]

675
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:12,507
Huh?

676
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:36,258
Not the same Cord.

677
01:25:41,263 --> 01:25:44,141
Your way lies
across the water.

678
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:52,190
You are the chosen.

679
01:25:55,402 --> 01:25:58,488
[dramatic music]

680
01:26:43,533 --> 01:26:46,036
You have sought Zetan.

681
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:48,288
Zetan is here.

682
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:05,514
My dear Cord.

683
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:08,225
I am so pleased to see you.

684
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:29,454
Extraordinary what the soil
here does for the perfume.

685
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:38,672
Please.

686
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,765
(Cord)
Who are they?

687
01:27:48,849 --> 01:27:51,518
(Zetan)
They are the Near Ones.

688
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:55,021
They are studying
the perfecting of perfection.

689
01:27:55,105 --> 01:27:57,065
(Cord)
Are you their teacher?

690
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:58,525
(Zetan)
No, not really.

691
01:27:58,608 --> 01:28:00,694
We have found
that the best way is

692
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:02,946
for the teacher, so called,
and the student

693
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:05,782
to produce the teaching
together.

694
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:07,993
What do you think?

695
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:11,121
Yes, it sounds reasonable.

696
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,473
Is something disturbing you, Cord?

697
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:38,607
No.

698
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:41,234
You seem somewhat puzzled.

699
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:46,198
I want to know
when we fight.

700
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:48,492
Who?

701
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:54,164
You and I.

702
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:56,708
About what?

703
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:58,376
The book.

704
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,504
The book.

705
01:29:00,587 --> 01:29:02,797
The everlasting book.

706
01:29:04,299 --> 01:29:06,343
Very well.

707
01:29:06,426 --> 01:29:10,472
We will go to the terrace and
rehearse you in the ceremony.

708
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:12,557
What ceremony?

709
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:18,522
The one that precedes your being
made the keeper of the book.

710
01:29:18,605 --> 01:29:21,483
Wait! Wait!
I don't understand.

711
01:30:04,484 --> 01:30:06,820
This is the seat of harmony, Cord.

712
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:11,324
There seems to me to be nothing
but harmony on this island.

713
01:30:11,408 --> 01:30:15,412
Yes, it, uh, permeates
everything here.

714
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:19,958
Try the seat, Cord.
Go on, try it.

715
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:35,223
Can you see your future, Cord?

716
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,685
<i>Endless days of peace.</i>

717
01:30:40,895 --> 01:30:44,649
ls there any man
who can wish for more?

718
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:50,447
The book,

719
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:52,490
please.

720
01:30:57,245 --> 01:30:59,247
The book.

721
01:31:07,255 --> 01:31:10,467
You have survived
several trials, I am sure.

722
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:12,469
Very frightening
they must have been,

723
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:15,347
but what you are
about to see now

724
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:19,184
may be even more alarming.

725
01:31:20,769 --> 01:31:23,188
You can take my place here, Cord,

726
01:31:23,271 --> 01:31:28,568
without looking into the book,
just as I did many years ago.

727
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:32,781
<i>I must look first.</i>

728
01:32:13,905 --> 01:32:18,827
The seekers fight their way here,
year after year,

729
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,204
willing, eager to pay
a terrible price

730
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:23,206
to see what is in that book.

731
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:25,500
<i>And when they ﬂing it open
in blazing expectation</i>

732
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:29,045
of finding all the answers
to all life's questions,

733
01:32:29,129 --> 01:32:31,172
what do they find?

734
01:32:31,256 --> 01:32:35,343
Themselves.

735
01:32:36,845 --> 01:32:39,973
There is no book, Cord.

736
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:43,601
No enlightenment

737
01:32:43,685 --> 01:32:46,020
outside yourself.

738
01:32:46,104 --> 01:32:48,773
There is nothing
to take back?

739
01:32:48,857 --> 01:32:50,734
No.

740
01:32:51,818 --> 01:32:54,404
<i>They are here, most of them.</i>

741
01:32:54,487 --> 01:32:58,074
Others have gone back
into the world,

742
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:00,076
and in all manner of disguises,

743
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:03,621
they have provided the trials
such as you have experienced.

744
01:33:04,706 --> 01:33:07,834
Some become teachers.

745
01:33:10,253 --> 01:33:12,964
And one of them
plays a ﬂute

746
01:33:14,758 --> 01:33:16,760
that only I can hear!

747
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:22,932
[laughs] I was your age when
I was sent to find the book,

748
01:33:23,016 --> 01:33:24,976
and I became the keeper.

749
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:27,812
Now you, Cord-
you can be the keeper.

750
01:33:27,896 --> 01:33:30,148
You will enjoy it-

751
01:33:30,231 --> 01:33:32,776
the endless peace and pleasure!

752
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:34,861
<i>Release me, Cord!</i>

753
01:33:37,155 --> 01:33:39,199
Release me.

754
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:43,870
[soft ﬂute music]

755
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:08,603
You've looked at the book, Cord.

756
01:34:10,313 --> 01:34:12,315
Yes.

757
01:34:15,318 --> 01:34:17,695
And what did you see?

758
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,282
Everything.

759
01:35:01,114 --> 01:35:03,324
[gentle ﬂute music]
