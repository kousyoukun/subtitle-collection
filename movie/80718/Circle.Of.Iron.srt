Morthond是赢家。

17
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,277
你，呃，犯了个错误。
You've, uh, made a mistake.

18
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:08,447
你把勋章给错人了。
You gave the medallion to the wrong man.

19
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,284
这是你的颜色吗?
Is this your color?

20
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,119
不。
No.

21
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,038
没有错误。
There was no error.

22
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,249
你在他倒下后打了他。
You hit him after he was down.

23
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,421
规矩是有的，而你违反了。
There are rules, and you have broken them.

24
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,509
你几乎违反了比赛的每一条规则。
You have chosen to break almost every rule of the contest.

25
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,553
你不穿战衣，就不属于任何团体。
You wear no fighting clothes, you belong to no group.

26
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,722
我自己的男人。
Lam my own man.

27
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,478
既然你只需要你自己，为什么还要来这里?
Then why have you come here if you need no one but yourself?

28
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:44,942
为了获得找到泽坦并击败他的权利，我走了很长一段路
L've come a long way to compete for the right to find zetan and defeat him

29
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,196
看看他看守的书里有什么。
and to see what is in a book he guards.

30
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,200
你对泽坦和他的启蒙之书了解多少?
What do you know of zetan and his book of enlightenment?

31
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,452
只知道这是一本书。
Only that it's a book.

32
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,415
它包含了世界上所有的智慧。
That it contains all the wisdom of the world.

33
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:09,717
科德，被选中寻找并击败泽坦人的人必须有能力用蜘蛛的网绑住大象。
Cord, he who is chosen to find and defeat zetan must have the ability to bind an elephant with the web of a spider.

34
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,220
而不是用一脚打晕他。
Not stun him with a kick.

35
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,931
摩蒙德被选中了!
Morthond has been chosen!

36
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,644
Morthond是个舞者!
Morthond is a dancer!

37
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,396
我一个战士!
L'm a fighter!

38
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,774
Morthond控制住了自己。
Morthond has controlled himself.

39
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,194
你还不是我们需要的锤炼武器。
You are not yet the tempered weapon that we need.

40
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,237
走吧!
Go!

41
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,905
现在!
Now!

42
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,752
首先一个问题。
One question first.

43
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,546
为什么你派去的其他人都没回来?
Why have all the others you've sent never returned?

44
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,758
一路上的考验是严峻的。
The trials along the way are severe.

45
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,595
泽坦已经证明了自己是无敌的。
Zetan has proved himself so far to be invincible.

46
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,848
那是因为你没有派对人来!
It is because you have never sent the right man!

47
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,600
但我能打败他!
But I can defeat him!

48
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,393
Cord!

49
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,228
你不能去。
You will not go.

50
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:06,148
我会打败这个无敌的泽坦人!
I will defeat this invincible zetan!

51
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,901
我要看看书里有什么!
And I will see what is in the book!

52
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,577
一年前，我发誓保持沉默。
One year ago, i took a vow of silence.

53
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,912
你什么时候弄坏的?
When did you break it?

54
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,414
现在!你为什么跟踪我?
Now! Why are you following me?

55
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,250
你生气是因为我打败了你。
You're angry because I defeated you.

56
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,044
你没有打败我!
You didn't defeat me!

57
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,211
你违反了规则!
You broke the rules!

58
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,546
又打我!
Fight me again!

59
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,214
它没有任何作用。
It serves no purpose.

60
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,592
你生来就没有大脑!打击我!
You were born without a brain! Fight me!

61
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,096
但我想帮你，不是杀你。
But I want to help you, not kill you.

62
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,933
我要找的是泽坦。
It's zetan I'm after.

63
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,600
重要的是吃水果，而不是怎么吃。
The important thing is eating the fruit, not how you get to it.

64
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,937
然后吃饭。
Eat then.

65
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,315
我的名字是科德。
My name is cord.

66
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,278
我在找一个叫泽坦的武术家。
L'm looking for a great martial artist called zetan.

67
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,699
你鼻子附近有一只蜜蜂。
There's a bee near your nose.

68
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,920
你是谁?
Who are you?

69
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,341
昨晚，我看到你创造了奇迹。
Last night, i saw you perform miracles.

70
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:42,682
如果泽坦的技能比你还强，我还没准备好接受他。
If zetan's skills are even greater than yours, i- I'm not ready for him.

71
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:49,022
以我所有的训练和双眼，在你面前我一秒钟都活不下去。
With all my training and both my eyes, I couldn't survive one second against you.

72
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,150
我的能力不是为了给你留下好印象。
My skills are not there to impress you.

73
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,538
我得到它!

74
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,582
现在我知道了!
Now I know!

75
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,293
你zetan。我才是瞎的那个!
You're zetan. I'm the one who's blind!

76
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,005
你是zetan吗?
Are you zetan?

77
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:22,013
不管你认为我是什么，或者想让我成为什么，我。
Whatever you think I am, or want me to be, lam.

78
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,934
当我的老师。
Be my teacher.

79
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,853
解释你做什么。我想练习。
Explain what you do. I want to practice.

80
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:38,863
把两只鸟拴在一起，即使它们有四只翅膀，它们也不能飞。
Tie two birds together, and though they have four wings- they cannot fly.

81
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,785
那我就跟着你看。
Well, I'll just follow you and watch.

82
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,746
我也不会说话打扰你。
And I won't annoy you by talking.

83
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,998
我可以保持沉默，相信我。
I can be silent, believe me.

84
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,461
他们说泽坦是一本书的守护者。
They say zetan's the guardian of a book.

85
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,588
他得了这病很多年了。
He's had it for many years.

86
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,467
你知道这本书吗?知道是什么吗?
Do you know anything about this book? Know what it is?

87
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,262
你觉得会很重要吗?
Do you, uh, think it could be important?

88
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,058
一个人年复一年地守护着一本书，哪个更重要?
Ifa man guards a book year after year, which is more important?

89
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,060
是人还是书?
The man or the book?

90
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,480
这就是秘密吗?
Is that the secret?

91
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:59,110
猴子想绕着你转——你不让——你不停地转。
The monkey tried to circle you- and you wouldn't let him- you kept turning.

92
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,780
猴子的方法就是装傻。
The way of the monkey is to play the fool.

93
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:07,243
当你嘲笑他的滑稽动作时，他从背后咬你。
While you laugh at his antics, he bites you from behind.

94
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:13,791
揭下他的自负，你就暴露了一个伪装成猴子的懦夫。
Unmask his ego, and you expose a coward disguised as a monkey.

95
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,793
L将研究它们。
L'll study them.

96
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,171
我会非常仔细地观察他们。
I'll watch them very carefully.

97
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,675
你已经模仿得很好了。
You already imitate their chattering perfectly.

98
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,761
哈!
Huh!

99
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,722
我没理由跟猴子打架。
I don't have any reason to fight monkeys.

100
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,766
这个教训没有价值。
This lesson has no value.

101
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:36,231
人是按照自己适合学习的程度来学习的。
One is taught in accordance to one's fitness to learn.

102
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,111
我要把舌头扯出来，把它
I'll tear my tongue out and put it-

103
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:00,213
morthond !等等!是Cord!
morthond! Wait! It's cord!

104

我给我的兄弟们带来了耻辱。
I have brought disgrace on my brotherhood.

105
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,367
这是Zetan干的?

106
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,704
Morthond,回答我!这是怎么发生的?

00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,961
Morthond，第一次审判是什么?在哪里?
Morthond, what was the first trial? Where?

110
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,339
猴子。

有什么可以帮你的吗，morthond?

帮助我光荣地死去。

猴子的方法119玩傻瓜。
The way of the monkey 119 to play the fool.

116
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:10,046
揭下他的自负，你就暴露了一个伪装成猴子的懦夫。
Unmask his ego, and you expose a coward disguised as a monkey.

117
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:14,652
你是谁?
Who are you?

118
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,362
我的名字是科德。
My name is cord.

119
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:21,409
你的乞食碗在哪里?
Where is your begging bowl?

120
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,870
我不是来求你的。
L'm not here to beg.

121
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,999
你不是来求我的吧?
You're not here to beg?

122
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,710
我是来接受初审的。

123
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:36,132
然后你会乞求。

124
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:44,682

一个没有母亲的男人!

130
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:11,459
你在找什么，没有母亲的男人吗?

And you think that to find him you must fight me, huh?

134
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:37,068
是的，你们用的是哪种公认的打法?
Yes, what acknowledged style of fighting do you use?

135
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,569

136
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:55,586
听我说，创造自己的人。
Listen to me, man who creates himself.

137
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:06,055
回去……你来时的样子，平静的样子。
Go back... The way you came, in peace.

138
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:09,600
我不想回去。

除非我必须找到泽坦，否则我不想和你战斗。
And I don't want to fight you unless I have to to find zetan.

140
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:30,997
泽塔就在我的另一边。
Zeta n is far away on the other side of me.

141
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:41,298
要找到他，你必须先穿过……我!
To reach him, you must first pass through... Me!

142
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,801
如果我绕着你走呢?
What if I just walk around you?

143
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:52,685
事情不是这样的!
That is not in the order of things!

144
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:04,822
是的，如果我是你的审判，那我就是你的审判。
Yes, if I am your trial, then I am your trial.

145
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:10,703
你不能绕过我。
You cannot walk around me.

146
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,705
那我就得和你决斗了。
Then l'll have to fight you.

147
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,956
是的。
Yes.

148
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,958
是的。
Yes.

149
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,513
告诉我去泽坦的路。
Now tell me the way to zetan.

150
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:41,061
拥抱西风，直到你来到一片荒野。
Embrace the west wind until you come to a wilderness.

151
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:44,940
在那里找一朵玫瑰。
Look for a rose there.

152
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,360
想要玫瑰吗?
Look for a rose?

153
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,362
这是第二次审判吗?
Is that the second trial?

154
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,783
你问去泽坦的路。
You asked the way to zetan.

155
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,995
还有其他人在我前面吗?
Are there others ahead of me?

156
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,125
你是第一个超过我的。
You are the first to pass me.

157
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,509
但其他探索者有其他的试验。
But other seekers have other trials.

158
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:22,394
我现在是拿着乞讨碗的乞丐了吗?
Am I a beggar with a begging bowl now?

159
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:24,730
我把你放进我的碗里!
L put you in my bowl!

160
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,639
我能为您效劳吗?
Can I help you?

161
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,641
要做什么?
To do what?

162
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,269
为什么?为了摆脱这个-?
Why? To get out of this-?

163
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,731
是谁这样折磨你?
Who's torturing you this way?

164
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,816
没有一个人。
No one.

165
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,112
那桶不是装满了油吗?
Isn't that barrel filled with oil?

166
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:59,450
当然可以。我自己加的。
Of course. I filled it myself.

167
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:03,287
我自己加的水，我自己进去的。你吗?
I filled it myself, and i got in it myself. You ?

168
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,539
我在这里已经十年了。
L've been in here ten years.

169
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,249
但是为什么呢?
But why?

170
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,631
为了摆脱我的下半身。
To rid myself of the bottom half of me.

171
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,386
现在已经所剩无几了。
There's very little left of it now.

172
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,893
你的腿看起来像海藻。
Your legs look like seaweed.

173
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,978
我希望如此。
I hope so.

174
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:35,861
那东西——我两腿之间那可怕的东西——现在差不多没了，是不是?
That thing- that terrible thing between my legs- it's almost gone now, isn't it?

175
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,535
只有丘疹。好。
A mere pimple. Good.

176
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,789
我希望它很快就会消失。
It'll go altogether soon, i hope.

177
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,128
十年!
Ten years!

178
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,423
你不吃东西怎么活?
How do you live without eating?

179
00:36:56,507 --> 00:37:01,261
我的家人。他们给我带了一些米饭，一些水。
My family. They bring me a little rice, a little water.

180
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,223
你的家人怎么样?
Your family?

181
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:07,309
他们知道你把自己泡在油里了吗?
They know you're dissolving yourself in oil?

182
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:10,437
他们一开始不太高兴。
They weren't too happy about it at first.

183
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,523
尤其是我的妻子。
Especially my wife.

184
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,777
现在她明白。
Now she understands.

185
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:23,909
但是你为什么要-啊。
But why would you want to- ah.

186
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,995
你可以像我一样发誓保持贞洁。
You could have taken a vow of chastity, like I have.

187
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,916
我发誓保持贞洁。我发了十个誓言，一百个。
I took a vow of chastity. I took ten vows- a hundred.

188
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:38,382
一个人怎么可能是一个圣洁的人当他被那可怕的东西束缚在地上的时候?
How can a man be a holy man when that terrible thing attaches him to the earth?

189
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:47,224
我摆脱了我的钱，我脱掉了我的衣服，我每天吃一勺饭，我的思想开始翱翔。
I got rid of my money, i shed my clothes, I ate a spoonful of rice each day, and my mind began to soar.

190
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,977
我感受到了宇宙。
I felt the universe.

191
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,188
我就是宇宙。
I was the universe.

192
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:58,735
然后，那可怕的东西召唤了我。
And then, that terrible thing summoned me.

193
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,613
“你好!“这叫道。
“Hello!” it cried.

194
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,700
“想想这乐趣吧!”
“Think of the pleasure!”

195
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,078
有好几次，我抓了把刀。
several times, i grabbed a knife.

196
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:11,415
我打算一劳永逸地摆脱它。
I intended to rid myself of it once and for all.

197
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,546
但我，我是个懦夫。
But i- i was a coward.

198
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:25,596
然后……我找到办法了!
Then... I found a way!

199
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:33,437
我会把它和承载它的腿一起溶解掉。
I would dissolve it away and the legs that carried it along.

200
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,316
哦，你明显有精神问题。
Oh, you are obviously mentally disturbed.

201
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,860
嗯哼。你应该去看医生。
Mm-hmm. You should ha ve seen a doctor:

202
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,904
我是一个医生。
I am a doctor.

203
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,954
你发过贞洁的誓言。
You took a vow of chastity.

204
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,956
是的。
Yes.

205
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,042
你不会留着它的。
You won't keep it.

206
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,378
跟我来。
Come in here with me.

207
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:03,175
有足够的空间。我们将彼此相伴。
There's plenty of room. We'll keep each other company.

208
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,969
对不起，我得走了。我在找人。
L'm sorry, but I must go. I'm looking for someone.

209
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,138
谁?ζn。
Who? Zeta n.

210
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,350
再zetan !
Again zetan!

211
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,186
他们都来询问泽坦!
They all come around asking about zetan!

212
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,606
泽坦没有答案。
There is no answer in zetan.

213
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,776
答案就在我这里。
The answer is in here with me.

214
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,445
如果你不把它融化，就把它切下来!
Lf you won't melt it off, cut it off!

215
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:28,075
现在就做!不管你的梦想是什么，都会毁了它们!
Do it now! For whatever your dreams are, it will ruin them!

216
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,788
那可怕的东西就像一把剑!
It's like a sword, that terrible thing!

217
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,792
它会——它会把你切成碎片!
It will- it will cut you to pieces!

218
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:19,973
你吃了吗?
Have you eaten?

219
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,768
你的饮料吗?你的手是空的。
Where's your drink? Your hand is empty.

220
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:25,187
和平。
Peace.

221
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,272
别怪我!
Don't wish it on me!

222
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,650
全世界都在骚动，你却祝我平安!
The whole world is in commotion, and you wish me peace!

223
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,737
我不知道什么是和平。我不想要。
I don't know what peace is. I don't want it.

224
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,073
你不听沙漠的声音吗?
Don't you listen to the desert?

225
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:40,744
即使没有风，沙子也会歌唱。
Even when there's no wind, the sand sings.

226
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,455
我的名字是科德。
My name is cord.

227
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,291
哈!你看到了?cord!
Hah! You see? Cord!

228
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,421
玩的共鸣!打动!
Play a chord! Strike a chord!

229
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,465
连你的名字都是噪音!
Even your name is a noise!

230
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,176
你想要什么，科德?
What do you want, cord?

231
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,762
你想让我们耍你吗?
You want us to play on you?

232
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:03,225
我的妻子能让你的皮肤歌唱。
My wives can make your skin sing.

233
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,644
你是谁?
Who are you?

234
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,729
长沙。
Changsha.

235
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:13,610
我希望提供一切需要的东西。
It is my wish to provide everything that is needed.

236
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:19,449
告诉我你需要什么，科德，好让我为你提供幸福。
Tell me what you need, cord, that I may find happiness in providing it for you.

237
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:26,915
我寻找一朵玫瑰……在旷野。
I seek a rose... in the wilderness.

238
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,377
她叫塔拉。
Her name is Tara.

239
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,631
我的第九的妻子。
My ninth wife.

240
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,843
你可以带走她。
You may have her.

241
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,886
但我发誓要保持贞洁。
But I've taken a vow of chastity.

242
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:45,225
哈,哈!带走她将是双重牺牲。
Hah,hah! Well, taking her will be a twin sacrifice.

243
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:50,313
她向我许的愿，你向自己许的愿。
Her of her vows to me, and you of your vows to yourself.

244
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,526
我的第二个试验。是你吗?
My second trial. Is it with you?

245
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:58,071
也许。
Perhaps.

246
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,115
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

247
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,077
你知道吗?
Do you know?

248
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,912
嗯?
Huh?

249
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:18,944
我的朋友，你还需要用我来考验你自己吗?
Is it still your need, my friend, to test yourself against me?

250
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,820
这是我的需要。
It is my need.

251
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:27,911
那就伸出你的手，我的黑兄弟，因为你的感觉会满足你。
Then put out your hand, my black brother, for what you feel will satisfy you.

252
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:43,338
你来找我是为了考验自己，在失败中，你获得了胜利。
You came to me to test yourself, and in losing, you have gained your victory.

253
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:46,716
现在，你们正站在真理的门槛上。
For now, you are on the threshold of truth.

254
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:56,017
那种知识，那种天赋，那才是你真正想从我这里得到的
That knowledge- that gift, which is what you really want from me-

255
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,773
你现在有了。
you have it now.

256
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,659
我们什么时候打架?
When do we fight?

257
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,372
等我们睡着了，我的孩子。
After we sleep, my boy.

258
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,621
它让你开心?
It pleases you?

259
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:47,420
你在哪里?你不会受到伤害的。
- Where is your- - no harm will come to you.

260
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,672
我丈夫让我来找你。
My husband sent me to you.

261
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,384
他是zetan吗?
Is he zetan?

262
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,554
他是长沙。
He is changsha.

263
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,932
不是这本书的保管者?
Not the keeper of the book?

264
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,434
什么书?
What book?

265
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,395
他为什么派你来?
Why did he send you?

266
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,315
这不会违背你的誓言。
This will not violate your vow.

267
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:12,904
想要的水果不吃也可以享用。
The desired fruit may be enjoyed without consuming it.

268
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:23,414
我已经旅行很长时间了。
L've been traveling for a longtime.

269
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:27,377
休息。
Rest.

270
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:35,260
我一直在走一段在我掌心指明的旅程。
L've been taking a journey that was indicated in the palm of my hand.

271
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,159
你是我的审判，不是吗?
You're my trial, aren't you?

272
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:08,126
让我和你一起在你的掌心里走一会儿。
Let me walk the line in your palm with you for a moment.

273
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,963
不。
No.

274
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:33,318
我来告诉你。
Let me show you.

275
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:39,610
你要求和我一起走我的手掌心线。
You asked to walk the line of my palm with me.

276
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:41,696
你拒绝我!
You refused me!

277
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,282
你现在邀请我了吗?
Do you invite me now?

278
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:53,708
跟我一起走，但一会儿也不行。
Walk with me, but not for just a moment.

279
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,502
直到永远。
Forever.

280
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,812
Cord.

281
00:55:14,896 --> 00:55:19,901
我和你一起去，但首先我们得休息。
L'll go with you, but first we must rest.

282
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,071
摆在我们面前的将是不容易的。
What lies ahead of us will not be easy.

283
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,357
泰拉?
Tara?

284
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,947
塔拉!
Tara!

285
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,913
塔拉!
Tara!

286
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,308
不!
No!

287
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,539
长沙!
Changsha!

288
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,126
长沙!
Changsha!

289
00:57:08,301 --> 00:57:13,514
长沙!
Changsha!

290
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,904
cord!我在这里。
Cord! I am here.

291
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:10,047
cord!我在这里。
Cord! I am here.

292
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:28,816
ζn ?
Zeta n ?

293
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,825
强于zetan。
Stronger than zetan.

294
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:44,331
死亡。我了解你。
Death. I kno w you.

295
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,221
你怎么这么丑?
Why are you so ugly?

296
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,726
还是每个男人的脸都不一样?
Or do you have a different face for every man?

297
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,109
我要跪下吗?
Shall I go to my knees?

298
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:18,783
你是在等恐惧冻结我的心再把它挖出来吗?
Are you waiting for fear to freeze my heart before you carve it out?

299
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:23,204
很快,cord!很快!
Soon, cord! Soon!

300
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,251
欢迎客人随时光临。
Come anytime, welcome guest.

301
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,715
这是不可能的。
It can't be done.

302
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:04,972
你做不到。
You can't do it.

303
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,769
不能做什么?
Can't do what?

304
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:14,148
你不可能在同一块水上踩两次。
You can't step twice on the same piece of water.

305
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,885
一条鱼曾经救过我的命。
A fish saved my life once.

306
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,638
如何?我吃了他。
How? I ate him.

307
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,438
你失明多久了?
How long have you been blind?

308
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,815
你失明多久了?
How long have you been blind?

309
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:59,693
-我又不是瞎子。我是- - - ?
- I'm not blind. - Am I?

310
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,946
你用问题来回答每个问题吗?
Do you answer every question with a question?

311
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:04,448
你会质疑每个答案吗?
Do you question every answer?

312
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,617
和你说话就像对着墙说话。
Talking to you is like talking to a wall.

313
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:11,622
有一次，佛陀坐在一堵墙前，当他起身时，他就开悟了。
Buddha once sat before a wall, and when he arose, he was enlightened.

314
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,791
你会把自己和佛陀比较吗?
Do you compare yourself with Buddha?

315
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,502
哈,哈,没有;只对着墙。
Hah, hah, no; Only to the wall.

316
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:35,270
你还没告诉我你的第二次审判。
You have not told me of your second trial.

317
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:40,025
这不是审判。
It wasn't a trial.

318
01:03:40,109 --> 01:03:42,069
这是一个教训。
It was a lesson.

319
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,990
教我吧。
Teach it to me.

320
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:49,618
啊，你知道的。
Ah, you know it.

321
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:52,663
你似乎什么都知道。
You seem to know everything.

322
01:03:52,746 --> 01:04:02,673
每天早晨，当我醒来时，就像一个上第一节课的学者一样，我准备着空白的头脑，准备着这一天的写作。
Each morning when I awake, like a scholar at his first class, I prepare a blank mind for the day to write upon.

323
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,928
一年前，我立下了贞洁的誓言。
A year ago i took a vow of chastity.

324
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,557
一天前我把它弄坏了。
A day ago I broke it.

325
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:18,147
很高兴，因为我意识到我们生来就是爱的。
Gladly, because I realized we are born to love.

326
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:24,778
但我当时做的事比任何愚蠢的誓言都要糟糕。
But what I did then was worse than taking any foolish vow.

327
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,116
我试图拥有我所爱的。
I tried to possess what I loved.

328
01:04:31,118 --> 01:04:37,958
那时我才知道，把爱的怀抱抱得太紧
I didn't know then that the embrace of love held too tightly

329
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,922
能毁掉你爱的人。
can destroy the one you love.

330
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,720
Cord.

331
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,600
流逝的每一刻都在改变着你。
Each moment that passes changes you.

332
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:59,521
你甚至不能拥有你自己。
You do not- cannot possess even yourself.

333
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:05,319
你怎么能希望拥有任何人或任何东西?
How can you hope to possess anyone or anything else?

334
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,763
我现在意识到你是我隐藏的老师。
I realize now you are my hidden teacher.

335
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,642
如果我想在下一次的考验中幸存下来，我必须被允许跟随你并学习。
And if I am to survive the next trial, i must be allowed to follow you and to learn.

336
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,603
你永远也忍受不了。我会的。
You will never endure it. I will.

337
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,605
我吗?
Will I?

338
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:45,109
哈，哈，告诉我为什么我不能忍受。
Hah, hah, tell me why i won't be able to endure it.

339
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:50,906
你永远不会有耐心。在你了解事物的含义之前，你就会对它们进行判断。什么东西?
You will never have the Patience. You will see things and judge them before you know what they mean. What things?

340
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:55,953
你看到了什么?你在事情发生之前就开始问。
You see? You ask what things even before the things have happened.

341
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,122
我无法理解你的不耐烦。
Your impatience is beyond me.

342
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:00,791
我会耐心等待。我将成为一个空容器!
I'll be patient. I'll be an empty vessel!

343
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,751
有一个条件。
One condition.

344
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:03,919
任何东西。
Anything.

345
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:11,176
在我亲自给你答复之前，你不要问任何事情。
You must ask nothing about any event until such time as i myself give you an answer.

346
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,553
同意了。
Agreed.

347
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:20,144
我们想过你的河。
We wish to cross your river.

348
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,938
我们俩的车费是多少?
What is the fare for the two of us?

349
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,440
你看起来不像有钱。
You don't look as if you have money.

350
01:06:25,524 --> 01:06:29,444
啊!啊!这样的报酬够吗?
Ah! Ah! Will this be payment enough?

351
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,531
啊哈。
Aha.

352
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,741
是的，是的，这就行了。
Yes, yes, this will do.

353
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:38,704
等等，你这个老傻瓜!让我看看。
Wait, you old fool! Let me see.

354
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:42,332
这是毫无价值的。如果你想过河，就游过去。
It's worthless. If you want to cross the river, swim.

355
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:46,003
停止!这是一个诚实的人。
Stop that! This is an honest man.

356
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:51,008
好像你在床上是个好男人，你这个笨蛋!
Like you are a good man in bed, you silly stick!

357
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,385
没有钱，就没有交通工具。
No money, no transportation.

358
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:57,055
这是我的船!我将决定。
It is my boat! I will decide.

359
01:06:57,139 --> 01:07:00,350
你的船吗?你可怜的儿子和我的。
Your boat? Your poor son's and mine.

360
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:02,644
什么时候变成你的了?
Since when is it yours?

361
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,314
自从我嫁给你，你这个笨蛋!
Since I married you, you ignoramus!

362
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:10,527
我不是用我的身体作为礼物吗?还有一个男孩的祝福?
Didn't I pay for it with the gift of my body... And the blessing of a boy child?

363
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:16,783
哈!20年来你给我的礼物是830英镑!
Hah! The gift you gave me once twenty yea rs 830!

364
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:20,704
你想怎么把船弄回来，白痴?你什么都不想。
How do you expect to get the boat back, you idiot? You never think of nothing.

365
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,789
那个可怜的男人。
That poor man.

366
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:26,126
他很高兴,快乐吗?
He's happy- happy?

367
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,837
他身上的每根骨头都充满了痛苦。
There's misery in every bone in his body.

368
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:33,717
不怕死的人不就是幸福的人吗?
Is not a happy man one who does not fear death?

369
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:39,723
他不仅不害怕，他的日子充满了期待它的快乐。
Not only does he not fear it, his days are filled with joy looking forward to it.

370
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,105
你为什么这么做?
Why'd you do that?

371
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:02,371
他想帮助我们。你就是这样报答他的吗?
He wanted to help us. Ls that how you repay him?

372
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:04,039
你毁了他的生计。
You've destroyed his livelihood.

373
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:07,376
他现在对她毫无防备了。
He'll be defenseless against her now.

374
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:13,006
我就说你会妄下结论。
I told you you would jump to conclusions.

375
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:19,596
-你在干什么?——隐藏。
- What are you doing? - Hiding.

376
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,432
这里没什么好隐瞒的。
There's nothing here to hide from.

377
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:24,601
还没有。
Not yet.

378
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,109
啊!他们见过你。
Ah! They've seen you.

379
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:36,655
我从没想过你会逃避战斗。
I never thought you'd run from a fight.

380
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,950
用笛子很难杀死一匹马。
Lt's hard to kill a horse with a flute.

381
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:51,057
为什么你一定要选择现在去做好事?
Why do you have to pick now to do good deeds?

382
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:56,146
你觉得内疚，因为你踢翻了船夫的船，所以你要自杀。
You're feeling guilty because you kicked in the ferryman's boat, so you're committing suicide.

383
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,440
你不仅是个傻瓜，你还不能信守诺言。
You're not only a fool, you can't keep a promise.

384
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:02,652
承诺什么?你说过你会把舌头扯出来
What promise? You said you would tear out your tongue-

385
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,211
烟囱也坏了。我们可以解决。
the chimney's broken too. We could fix that.

386
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,296
屋顶需要修理。
And the roof needs mending.

387
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,686
我想跟你道别。
L'm thinking of saying good-bye.

388
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,771
再见。
Good-bye.

389
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,858
我曾疯狂地相信你是我的老师。
I was crazy to believe you were my teacher.

390
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:10,113
学会倾听别人没有说出来的话。
Learn to listen to that which is not spoken.

391
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,324
我听腻了你的谜语。
L'm tired of your riddles.

392
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:14,492
刚才发生的事没有任何教训。
There was no lesson in what just happened.

393
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:17,454
我只看到一个傻子邀请刺客来杀他。
All I saw was a fool inviting his assassins to kill him.

394
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:20,457
傻瓜是聪明人的孪生兄弟。
The fool is the twin of the wise.

395
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,917
啊。
Ah.

396
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:33,637
你不可能两次踩在同一块水上，两只被绑在一起的鸟有四只翅膀，但不能飞，而且——而且——蝌蚪失去了力量，剑也不能割伤自己。
And you can't step on the same piece of water twice, and two birds tied together have four wings but cannot fly, and- and- and the tadpole loses its strength, and the sword can't cut itself.

397
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:39,809
一旦目标出现在眼前，路径和通道就没有意义了。
The path and the gateway have no use or meaning once the objective is in sight.

398
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:47,484
马没有乳房，牛不会嘶鸣，上是下，侧是正对。
And a horse has no udders, and a cow can't whinny, and up is down, and sideways is straight ahead.

399
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,078
噢,看。看。
Oh, look. Look.

400
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:00,580
他们是谁?噢'。
Who are they? Ow'.?

401
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,924
先生,请。你有硬币吗?
Mister, please. Do you have a coin?

402
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,386
硬币!硬币!请。
Coin! Coin! Please.

403
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:22,370
为什么?
Why?

404
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,959
这次我要走了。
This time I'm leaving.

405
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,754
你必须停止承诺。
You must stop making promises.

406
01:16:30,837 --> 01:16:33,423
这不仅仅是一个承诺。
This is more than a promise.

407
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:37,010
现在我摆脱了你，我可以问问题了。
Now that I'm free of you, I'm free to ask questions.

408
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,012
解释你自己。
Explain yourself.

409
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:42,265
你踢进渡船是什么意思?
What did you mean by kicking in the ferryboat?

410
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:46,102
我们两个中，你是瞎的那个。
Of the two of us, you are the one who is blind.

411
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:48,104
被你所看到的蒙蔽了双眼。
Blinded by what you see.

412
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:51,232
我要的是答案，不是这些哲学。
I want an answer, not all this philosophy.

413
01:16:51,316 --> 01:17:00,617
我把船弄坏了，因为如果我不这样做，士兵们就会用它过河，老人和他的家人就会被杀死。
I damaged the boat because if I hadn't, the soldiers would have used it to cross the river, and the old man and all his family would have been killed.

414
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,453
也许是为了获得幸福。
Achieving his happiness, perhaps.

415
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,997
但是你怎么知道士兵来了?
But how did you know the soldiers were coming?

416
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,958
-你听到了吗?——没有。
- Did you hear them? - No.

417
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:12,921
石头墙。你为什么停下来修理它?
The stone wall. Why did you stop to repair it?

418
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:17,008
有一袋硬币露出了一部分在石头里。
There was a bag of coins partly exposed in the stones.

419
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:23,973
我修复了城墙，这样士兵就不会发现并偷走它，让寡妇和她的孩子们没有经济来源。
I repaired the wall so the soldiers wouldn't find it and steal it, leaving the widow and her children without means.

420
01:17:24,057 --> 01:17:27,644
你看不到包。你闻到了吗?
You couldn't see the bag. Did you smell it?

421
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:30,146
不。
No.

422
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:32,607
这个男孩。解释这个男孩。
The boy. Explain the boy.

423
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,651
这个男孩。
The boy.

424
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:38,488
你残害了那个男孩。你打断了他的鼻子，一个漂亮的男孩。
You mutilated the boy. You broke his nose, a beautiful boy.

425
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,782
太漂亮了。
Too beautiful.

426
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:44,661
他是个暴君。他长大后会变得更糟。
He was a tyrant. He would have grown up to be worse.

427
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:48,998
我把他的父母从他的美貌中解放出来。
I freed his parents from their bondage to his beauty.

428
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,959
哈!你连他的脸都没摸。
Hah! You didn't even touch his face.

429
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:54,128
你怎么知道他长什么样?你感觉到了吗?
How'd you know what he looked like? Dio' you sense it?

430
01:17:54,212 --> 01:18:03,680
不。但我也救了他的父母和那男孩，现在，我让你摆脱了我。
No. But I freed his parents and the boy too, and now, I free you of me.

431
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:06,015
我还没说完呢。
Well, I haven't finished yet.

432
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:12,021
你没有听到士兵的声音，你没有闻到袋子的味道，你没有感觉到那个男孩。
You didn't hear the soldiers, and you didn't smell the bag, and you didn't sense the boy.

433
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,023
我需要一个解释。
I want an explanation.

434
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,025
我知道。
I knew.

435
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:18,403
如何?
How?

436
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,121
你以前来过这里!
You were through here before!

437
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:33,543
多少次?
How many times?

438
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:21,674
这是什么?
What is this?

439
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,761
Cord?

440
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:30,600
哈，哈，是，cord!
Hah, hah, yes, cord!

441
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:35,438
我在荒野里款待的那个人。
The man I entertained in the wilderness.

442
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:39,525
同样的cord，是的。
The very same cord, yes.

443
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:46,658
不，不一样了。
No, not the same.

444
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,702
不完全是。
Not quite.

445
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:55,959
但你要找的仍然是- n。
But you're still looking for the same- zeta n.

446
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,962
哈!是的。
Hah! Yes.

447
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,382
ζn。
Zeta n.

448
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,013
他很近了。
He's very near.

449
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:13,351
哦。非常非常近了。
Oh. Very, very near.

450
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:16,729
你要做的就是从我身边过去。
All you have to do is pass by me.

451
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:21,150
我和你没有矛盾。
I have no quarrel with you.

452
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,987
没有争吵?
No quarrel?

453
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:31,202
哈，哈，可是你的爱情呢，塔拉?
Hah, hah, but what of your love, Tara?

454
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:35,164
我不是把塔拉钉死在十字架上了吗?
Did I not crucify Tara?

455
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:37,125
不。
No.

456
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:48,469
但是我自己，用这两只手——不，我自己，用这两只手。
But I myself, with these two hands- no, I myself, with these two hands.

457
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:50,930
不是同一个cord。
Not the same cord.

458
01:20:52,724 --> 01:20:57,854
所以你不用仇恨来对抗我。
So, you do not confront me with hate.

459
01:20:57,937 --> 01:20:59,814
不。
No.

460
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,025
那为什么还要跟我对质
Then why confront me at all?

461
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,110
加入我。
Join me.

462
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,195
牵起我的手。
Take my hand.

463
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:12,201
我可以带你去一个没有夜晚和克莱的世界。
Ah, I can show you a world where you will find no night or Clay.

464
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,830
太阳永远不会升起或落下。
The sun will never rise or set.

465
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:17,832
我的目标是泽坦。
My goal is zetan.

466
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,917
啊,是的。
Ah, yes.

467
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:25,840
在黎明。
At daybreak then.

468
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,884
沿着海滩。
Along the beach.

469
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,511
不。
No.

470
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:32,513
现在。
Now.

471
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,566
嗯?
Huh?

472
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:12,506
嗯?
Huh?

473
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:36,257
不是同一个cord。
Not the same cord.

474
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:44,140
你的路要跨过水面。
Your way lies across the water.

475
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,189
你是被选中的。
You are the chosen.

476
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,035
你在寻找泽坦。
You have sought zetan.

477
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,287
Zetan在这里。
Zetan is here.

478
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:05,513
我亲爱的cord
My dear cord.

479
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:08,224
我很高兴见到你。
I am so pleased to see you.

480
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:29,453
这里的土壤对香水的作用非同一般。
Extraordinary what the soil here does for the perfume.

481
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,671
请。
Please.

482
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,764
他们是谁?
Who are they?

483
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:51,517
它们是最接近的。
They are the near ones.

484
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,020
他们在研究完美的完善。
They are studying the perfecting of perfection.

485
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:57,064
你是他们的老师吗?
Are you their teacher?

486
01:27:57,148 --> 01:27:58,524
不,不是真的。
No, not really.

487
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:05,781
我们发现，最好的方法就是让老师，也就是学生，一起进行教学。
We have found that the best way is for the teacher, so called, and the student to produce the teaching together.

488
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,992
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

489
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:11,120
是的，听起来很合理。
Yes, it sounds reasonable.

490
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:29,472
有什么事困扰你吗，科德?
Is something disturbing you, cord?

491
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:38,606
不。
No.

492
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:41,233
你似乎有些困惑。
You seem somewhat puzzled.

493
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:46,197
我想知道我们什么时候吵架。
I want to know when we fight.

494
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,491
谁?
Who?

495
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:54,163
你和我
You and I.

496
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,707
关于什么?
About what?

497
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:58,375
这本书。
The book.

498
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:00,503
这本书。
The book.

499
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:02,796
永恒的书。
The everlasting book.

500
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:06,342
很好。
Very well.

501
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:10,471
我们去阳台，在仪式上给你们排练。
We will go to the terrace and rehearse you in the ceremony.

502
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,556
什么仪式?
What ceremony?

503
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:18,521
在你存在之前的那个人，被任命为这本书的守护者。
The one that precedes your being made the keeper of the book.

504
01:29:18,604 --> 01:29:21,482
等等!等等!我不明白你的意思。
Wait! Wait! I don't understand.

505
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,819
这是和谐之座，cord。
This is the seat of Harmony, cord.

506
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:11,323
在我看来，这个岛上只有哈莫尼。
There seems to me to be nothing but Harmony on this island.

507
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:15,411
是的，它渗透到这里的一切。
Yes, it, uh, permeates everything here.

508
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:19,957
试试座椅，cord。来吧，试试。
Try the seat, cord. Go on, try it.

509
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:35,222
你能看到你的未来吗，科德?
Can you see your future, cord?

510
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,684
无尽的宁静。
Endless clays of peace.

511
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:44,648
还有人能有更多的愿望吗?
Ls there any man who can wish for more?

512
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:52,489
请书。
The book, please.

513
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:59,246
这本书。
The book.

514
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:10,466
我相信你经受过很多考验。
You have survived several trials, I am sure.

515
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:19,183
他们一定很可怕，但你现在要看到的可能更令人担忧。
Very frightening they must have been, but what you are about to see now may be even more alarming.

516
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:28,567
你可以代替我，科德，不用看书，就像我多年前那样。
You can take my place here, cord, without looking into the book, just as I did many years ago.

517
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:32,780
我必须先看看。
I must look first.

518
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:23,205
探索者们一路战斗到这里，年复一年，愿意，渴望付出可怕的代价来看看那本书里的内容。
The seekers fight their way here, year after year, willing, eager to pay a terrible price to see what is in that book.

519
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:31,171
当他们满怀着寻找生命中所有问题的答案的强烈期望，把它打开时，他们发现了什么?
And when they fling it open in blazing expectation of finding all the answers to all life's questions, what do they find?

520
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:33,257
他们自己。
Themselves.

521
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,342
他们自己。
Themselves.

522
01:32:36,844 --> 01:32:39,972
没有书，cord。
There is no book, cord.

523
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:46,019
没有外在的启迪。
No enlightenment outside yourself.

524
01:32:46,103 --> 01:32:48,772
没有什么可收回的了?
There is nothing to take back?

525
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:50,733
不。
No.

526
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:54,403
他们大多数人都在这里。
They are here, most of them.

527
01:32:54,486 --> 01:33:03,620
其他人已经回到这个世界，以各种各样的伪装，他们提供了你所经历过的考验。
Others have gone back into the world, and in all manner of disguises, they have provided the trials such as you have experienced.

528
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:07,833
一些成为教师。
Some become teachers.

529
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:16,759
其中一个吹的笛子只有我能听到!
And one of them plays a flute that only I can hear!

530
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:24,975
我在你这么大的时候被派去找这本书，我成了守护者。
I was your age when i was sent to find the book, and I became the keeper.

531
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,811
现在你，cord，你可以做守护者。
Now you, cord- you can be the keeper.

532
01:33:27,895 --> 01:33:32,775
你会享受它——无尽的宁静和快乐!
You will enjoy it- the endless peace and pleasure!

533
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:34,860
释放我,cord!
Release me, cord!

534
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:39,198
释放我。
Release me.

535
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:08,602
你已经看过那本书了，科德。
You've looked at the book, cord.

536
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:12,314
是的。
Yes.

537
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,694
你看到了什么?
And what did you see?

538
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,281
一切。
Everything.
