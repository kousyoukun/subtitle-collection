Captain Chantal Dubois. Get up.
杜波依斯上尉 起床了

582
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,822
It's just a pillow!

583
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,491
That's the oldest trick in the book, Comandante.
指挥官 这是书上的老桥段了

584
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,286
Every bambino in Italy knows that one.
在意大利连小孩都知道 

585
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:36,373
Maybe, but do they know about the old escape hole

586
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,084
behind the innocent-looking poster?
会有一个挖来逃跑的洞吗?

587
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,425
Or the really old "I'm gonna hide up on the ceiling" trick!
还是说真正的老把戏是"我躲在天花板里"

588
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:53,766
Of course.
当然

589
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,018
The secret tunnel under the bed!

Let's go!
我们走!

592
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,862
This secret tunnel is a dead end!
秘密通道是死胡同!

593
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,783
There's nothing but bedsprings and mattress stuffing down here!
这里除了床面和床垫什么都没有!

594
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,787
Was that the sound of a cell door closing?
那是牢门关掉的声音吗?

595
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:20,922
丢失的狮子

595
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:24,922
Voilá!
找到了!

596
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,302
Was that the sound of my HP printer printing?
那是我的惠普打印机工作的声音吗?

597
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,814
This is a disaster!
这简直是一场灾难!

598
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:46,151
We blow all our money on a bad circus, and we're not any closer to New York!
全部的钱都浪费在糟糕的马戏团上了 却没能拉近我们和纽约的距离!

599
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,736
If anything, we're further away!
如果有区别的话 就是我们离纽约更远了!

600
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:51,073
We could have at least bought a circus that knew how to circ!
我们至少应该买一个懂杂技的马戏团!

601
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,660
I don't even know why we bought a circus in the first place.
我都不明白起初为什么要买马戏团

602
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,787
We had enough dough for a plane!
我们本来有足够的钱买架飞机!

603
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,788
Are you kidding me?
你在开玩笑吧?

604
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,456
You must have some money left over.
你肯定还有一些剩下的钱

605
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,835
I used it to buy teeth and then have them capped in gold.
我用来买了牙齿 然后给他们镶上黄金

606
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,170
Now I can eat apples!
现在我可以吃苹果了!

607
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,966
Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.
遗憾的是 我发现我并不喜欢苹果

608
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,428
No promoter is sending this show to America. It's toe up!
根本没有人会赞助马戏团去美国表演 完蛋了!

609
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,596
Now it all makes sense.
现在一切都清楚了

610
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,683
No wonder the circus master was so happy to sell.
难怪马戏团主这么高兴出售

611
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:21,103
He was happy, all right. Happy about ripping us off!
对啊 他开心了 开心的是他骗了我们! 

612
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,525
Where did Alex go?
亚利克斯去哪儿了?

613
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,734
I don't know.

614
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,705
Come on! This way!
过来! 这边走!

615
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,207
No, no, no. You come this way!

616
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,418
Alice, watch your head!
爱丽丝 注意别碰头!

617
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:07,399

00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,818

Fantastic!

Was that trapeze americano?
刚才那是美式空中飞人吗?

621
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,951
Yeah. Sort of.
对 算是吧

622
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:18,994
Incredible!

623
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,495

Come this way, Alice!
这边走 爱丽丝!

625
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,085
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss." Alex. Like New York Knicks.
顺便说 是"克斯"而不是"丝" 我叫亚利克斯 就像纽约尼克斯一样

626
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,465
I know. New York Kniss. Is not hard.
我知道 纽约尼斯 并不难啊

627
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,217
Whoa.

00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,519
What is this place?

but there is something you must know.
但有些事儿你得知道

631
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,821
There was a time when Circus Zaragoza,

Numero uno in all the Europa!

634
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:04,122
And Vitaly... he was the biggest star of us all.

635
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,293
He was fearless. Taking risks. Always new.

He jump through the hoop like he could fly!

641
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,985
- Like this?  - Good!

642
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:52,170
It had never been done before because it was physically impossible!

And the hoop, she got smaller!

647
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,067
Like the ring
就像最瘦小的女士

648
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,780
on a finger of the tiniest lady with the slimmest of fingers.

Light the hoop on fire!

654

He fly too close to the sun... and he got burned.
他飞得离太阳太近... 被烧伤了

655
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:04,409
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil is extra flammable.
实际上 特级初榨橄榄油更加易燃

656
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,411
And he lost everything.

657
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,790
His wife, she run off with a musician.

658
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,335
He lost his dignity... his fame...

659
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,089
his passion... and his fur.
他的激情... 还有他的皮毛

And when it grow back, it is less soft. More like a prickly beard.
新长出来的皮毛却没那么软 更像是扎人的胡子

661

His only passion now is the borscht.

664
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,356
Whoa.

00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,650
He was our inspiration.
他曾是我们的台柱

666

So when he lost his passion,

667
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,780
well... as Vitaly goes, so goes the circus.
的确... 马戏团也就随着维塔利一起衰败了

671
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,039
We find a new passion.

制作一个新节目 然后一路走向美国!

673

I know. It is stupido idea.

674
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,808
We are a lost cause.

676
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,649
- What?  - What you just said.
- 什么?  - 你刚才说的

681
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,956
Some say I'm even slightly below.
有人说甚至比平均还稍低点

We are gonna rethink everything anybody's ever known about circus!

wherein, in order to get home,

Fresh, never before seen! Off the chain!

Something that'll blow that circus promoter away!

- 你以为自己是谁!  - 我要啃了他的腿!

691
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,192
Circus has been same for generations!
马戏团世世代代都是一样的!

692
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,360
We make good, classic family entertainment.

693
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,197
But last few generations,

694
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,533
families... not so entertained.
这娱乐... 却不怎么娱乐

695
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,705
That's right. Families not so entertained
没错 家庭不那么娱乐了

696
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,416
because you're just going through the motions out there.

697
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,502
It's missing passion.
这里面缺少激情

698
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,297
How one to have passion for stool poked in face?
被凳子戳脸的人该如何有激情?

699
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:26,092
Exactly! And by stool you mean chair, right?
确实! 关于凳子 你指的是椅子对吧?

700
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,221
The fact is, you guys, you got stuck in a rut.

You stopped pushing, you stopped taking risks.

But those days are over.

Because now we're going to completely change the show.

704
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,940
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?
然后这就不是个马戏了 对吗?

705
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,943
Circus is not about the acts you do.
马戏和你的行为无关

706
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,654
Circus is in here.
马戏就在这

707
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,073
How come Freddie gets all the circus?
弗莱迪是怎么得到所有马戏的?

708
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,953
Circus is about following your passions, wherever they take you!
马戏是在于追随你的热情 无论它带你到哪!

709
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,207
You cannot change circus. There is long tradition!
你不能改变马戏 这是有悠久历史的!

710
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,167
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
每个人都那样想 维塔利

711
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,545
until those French Canadians came along,
直到那些法裔加拿大人的出现

712
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,756
drunk off their maple syrup and cheap pharmaceuticals,
喝光了枫糖浆和廉价药品

713
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,092
and completely flipped the paradigm.
完全颠覆了传统

714
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,430
Now they play Vegas. Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.
现在他们在赌城演出 每天在52个会场有50场节目

715
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,683
And one of them completely in the nude.
其中一场还是裸体的

716
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,726
Yeah, that's right. And you know how they did it?
没错 正是如此 你们知道他们怎么做到的吗?

717
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,853
Take off their clothes?
脱光衣服?

718
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,691
- No. They got rid of the animals.  - What?

- Say it ain't so!  - Che stupida! No animals...
- 你不是在说真的吧?  - 说什么蠢话! 没有动物...

- How could they?!  - Well, you know what I say to that?
- 怎么能这样?!  - 你们懂我的意思了吗?

I say they can take the animals out of the circus,

but they cannot take the animals out of the circus!

We don't need humans because we've got passion.
我们不需要人类 因为我们已经富有激情

728
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,845
What does a human say when he's passionate?
人类在激动的时候会说什么?

729
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,389
He says, "I'm an animal!" Well, we are animals!
他会说"我是动物!" 而我们本来就是动物!

730
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,352
We'll make an all-animal circus!
我们会成立一个全是动物的马戏团!

731
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,772
Because if we follow our passion, we can go anywhere.
因为如果我们追随激情 就可以去任何地方

We're in! We'll have some of that!

We can do that funk and groove dance thing!

743
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,425
- Dance?  - This thing right here. Look.

Me and you! We got this!

I do not trust this lion.

Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

750
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,946
but I am tired of sitting and standing and rolling over.
但我厌倦了天天坐立 起身和翻滚

751
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,825
It is great tradition of sitting, standing, rolling over.
坐立 起身和翻滚都是优良的传统

752
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,286
You know our circus is in trouble.
但你也知道我们马戏团陷入困境了

753
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:03,708
This could be our last chance. But we will not do this without you.

754
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,836

I mean, the music totally throws off my timing.

It's just like dancing, Melman. Two steps forward, one step back.
这就像跳舞 麦尔曼 两步向前 一步向后

831
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,331
I can't dance, OK? There, I said it.

832
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,042
Maybe because you've never tried.

No, I have tried.

That part is so easy, Melman. OK?
那部分很容易的好吗 麦尔曼?

到最后我才知道 你的名字也不是爱丽丝
