1
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,546
Ok. Wind her up, boys!

2
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,382
It's monte Carlo or bust.

3
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,800
- Struts.
- Check.

4
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:51,926
- Flaps.
- Check.

5
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,803
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

6
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,890
We'll be back from our gambling spree
in a couple weeks.

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,976
- Bye!
- Or whenever the gold runs out.

8
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,102
- Buh-bye!
- Good-bye.

9
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,937
All right! We'll be waiting for you!

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,107
Just kidding!
We're never coming back!

11
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,567
Sorry! What was that?

12
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,569
Initiate warp drive.

13
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,242
Did they just say
they were never coming back?

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,995
Guys?

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,416
Marty?

16
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,209
Oh, goody, you're here!

17
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,503
Why don't you just chew on this?

18
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,255
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,095
I'm just messing with you.

20
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,265
I lost all feeling
in this thing years ago.

21
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,269
Melman? Why do you look like that?

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,396
Look who's talking.

23
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,566
Gloria? Why are you guys so... elderly?

24
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,486
Now, when was the last time
you looked in the mirror?

25
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,695
What?

26
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,489
No!

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,866
Wake up! Wake up, ally-Al!

28
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,034
- Wake up!
- Marty!

29
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,660
Marty, it was horrible.

30
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,370
That same nightmare again, huh?

31
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,624
We were stuck here in Africa,
and we were all super-old and wrinkly...

32
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,251
Well, I aged well,
but the rest of you looked terrible!

33
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,421
Relax, Alex.
'Cause I got a surprise for you!

34
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,049
Is it the penguins?
Have they come to take us home?

35
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,010
Nope. But it's the next best thing.

36
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,804
Another day bites the dust.

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,971
Come on, now!

38
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,723
Watch it. Watch yourself. Small divots!

39
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,560
Sorry, little incline there.
Back up this hill.

40
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:29,315
A low-hanging branch,
then just over this bluff and voilá!

41
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,737
Happy birthday, pal!

42
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,782
Whoa.

43
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,330
Wow! New York city.

44
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,499
Surprise!

45
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,961
Gloria! You're the statue of liberty!

46
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,088
Bring me your huddled masses, baby!

47
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,632
And, melman, you're the Brooklyn bridge!

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,425
Actually, I'm the triboro bridge.

49
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,345
Wow! You guys made this?

50
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,391
Yeah. From memory!
From crazy, obsessive memory.

51
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,895
Hey! Fifth avenue... with no traffic!

52
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,066
There's times square, with its
modern-day corporate lack of character.

53
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,944
Nine Duane reades on the same street!

54
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,365
And the zoo.

55
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,534
Wow, our home.

56
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,286
Look! There's a little me.

57
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,038
And little all of us-es!

58
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,880
Alex! Alex! Alex!

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,148
Oh, no!

60
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,787
You guys.
You've both made and ruined my day.

61
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,956
Make a wish, sweetheart.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,004
Your wish has come true!

63
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,756
Oh, yay!

64
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,425
My tummy is speaking to me!

65
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,093
Oh, gross!

66
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,055
I wouldn't eat that side of the cake
if I were you.

67
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,974
Alex, what was your wish?

68
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,894
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

69
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,605
I love this.
But it's not the real thing.

70
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,358
That's because it's a mud model, Alex.

71
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,110
It's not actually new York.
I hope that was clear.

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,528
What are we doing?

73
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,531
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.

74
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,202
But... we should just go to monte Carlo
and get them.

75
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,082
How do a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and
a hippo walk into a casino in monte Carlo?

76
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,334
I don't know. Ask the rabbi!

77
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,585
- Hey, I'm serious.
- Come on!

78
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,421
We can do it!
We can do anything! It's us!

79
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,422
We're us!

80
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,925
Yeah, that's right.
We've gone halfway around the world!

81
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,929
Compared with that, monte Carlo's
just a hop, skip and a swim away!

82
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:05,930
Yeah.

83
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,056
To home.

84
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,265
- Home!
- Home.

85
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,101
- Home.
- Cheeseburger.

86
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,229
Tell you what, bet those penguins
will be glad to see us.

87
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,148
Yeah, they're probably
bored out of their minds!

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,165
You pillow fight
like a bunch of little girls!

89
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:39,171
Chimichanga! These pillows
are filled with baby birds!

90
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,701
What?

91
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,911
There it is. The casino!

92
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,165
What?

93
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,959
I said, "perfect.
That's where we'll find the penguins."

94
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,171
What?

95
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,591
Come on, guys.

96
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,135
Operation penguin extraction
does not include levity.

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,262
We can't draw attention to ourselves.

98
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,681
We're invisible!

99
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,309
I'm talking really, really quiet.

100
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,229
Everybody dance now!

101
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,566
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

102
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,235
Everybody dance now!

103
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,780
Yeah!

104
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,035
Ok. Phase one: We break into the casino,
grab the penguins,

105
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,536
and get them
to take us back to new York

106
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,163
in the monkey-powered super plane!

107
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,164
Check.

108
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,375
Phase two: We chew out the penguins
for abandoning us in Africa.

109
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,543
Check.

110
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,254
Phase three:
We apologize to the penguins

111
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,759
for overly harsh chewing outing,
but we've gotten our point across.

112
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,804
Phase four: Back to new York city.

113
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,846
- Yes!
- I like it!

114
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,767
All right, we take
these ventilation ducts

115
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,311
to the crawlspace above the casino
where we find the penguins.

116
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,315
I just need to figure out
which duct each of us should take.

117
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,109
Pause back with the bass

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,694
the jam is live in effect
and I don't waste time

119
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,863
on the mic with a dope rhyme
jump to the rhythm

120
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,324
jump, jump to the rhythm, jump...

121
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,096
Oh, no!

122
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,266
Take cover!

123
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,768
- Hi, honey.
- Ok!

124
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,772
Ok, ok. I got you. I got you, honey.

125
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,615
Now, they're not gonna let
animals on to the casino floor,

126
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,451
so expect some kind of disguise.

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,206
Look at that!
That is one ugly, mug-ugly lady!

128
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,500
That is roach-killing ugly!

129
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,794
That's not a lady.
That's the king of versailles.

130
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,754
And that's not the king of versailles.

131
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,174
That's the chimps.
And the chimps are like smoke.

132
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,969
And where there's smoke, there's fire.
And by fire, I mean the penguins!

133
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,053
King of versailles wins again.

134
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,805
I say we let it ride.

135
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,311
Then we'll pick up the hippies
and fly back to new York in style.

136
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,687
Can we buy an airbus a-380?

137
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,606
Solid gold, baby!

138
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,025
Sir! A solid gold plane
wouldn't be able to fly.

139
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,153
Kowalski, we'll be rich!
The rules of physics don't apply to us.

140
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,196
Let it ride!

141
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,405
Right-o!

142
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,120
Ok. In exactly two minutes and 17
seconds, the lemurs will cut the power.

143
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
- Now?
- No.

144
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,331
- Ok?
- No.

145
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,332
- Now?
- No.

146
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,793
I drop down, grab the penguins.
You crank me up, and we are out of here.

147
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,338
Let me drop down!
I'll grab the penguins!

148
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,672
You don't have fingers, Marty.

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,466
- Now? Do it?
- No. No!

150
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,967
These are things a leader
has to think of.

151
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,220
Why should you be the leader?
Why not me?

152
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,888
'Cause I'm the phase tracker!

153
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,515
The king is letting it ride.

154
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,435
- How did I get phased out?
- You're part of a phase.

155
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,562
A phase isn't something you own,
it's something you're in.

156
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,563
That's it.

157
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,900
Who voted you
grand phase master anyway?

158
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,443
Me! I voted me!
'Cause I'm the leader!

159
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,528
- Black!
- That's it, baby!

160
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,529
- Now?
- No!

161
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,574
The king of versailles wins it all!

162
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,201
- Maybe I should be in charge.
- Melman!

163
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,619
I am a doctor.

164
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:39,662
- Now!
- No.

165
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,829
Why can't we all be leaders?

166
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,165
Enough! I'm gonna lead.

167
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,976
What's new, pussycat?

168
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,310
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

169
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,062
Marty, what phase are we at?

170
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,231
Phase three: Apologize!

171
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,400
Right. Oh, man, we are so sorry.

172
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,111
Apology accepted. Let's roll!

173
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,281
Marty! We skipped phase two!
We didn't chew them out!

174
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,783
Don't look at me.
I'm just following the leader!

175
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,412
- Now!
- I'm a bit busy right now.

176
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,038
Just pull the switch!

177
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,332
Ok, fine.

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,590
What the heck is going on
with the lights?

179
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,093
Yo, tell me what you want
what you really, really want

180
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,595
I'll tell you what I want
what I really, really want...

181
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,431
What are you doing?!

182
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,932
Come on!

183
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,355
Initiate lockdown!

184
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,817
And get me captain Dubois
from animal control!

185
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,950
Speak.

186
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,786
Oui.

187
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,288
A zebra?

188
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,873
A hippo?

189
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,124
A giraffe?

190
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,126
A lion?!

191
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,963
When I was seven,
I strangled my first parrot,

192
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,759
flushed my first goldfish,
punched my first snake.

193
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:21,764
Now I have finally reached the moment
I have been preparing for my entire life.

194
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,266
The pinnacle of my career:

195
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,561
To hunt the king of the beasts!

196
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,494
- Oh, no.
- Lockdown, eh?

197
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,495
What do we do?

198
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,248
All right, everybody, stand back.
I got this one.

199
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,046
Never mind.

200
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,132
Well, you only get one chance
at a first impression.

201
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,350
- What just happened?
- Where are we? What is this?

202
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,353
We call it
the luxury assault recreational vehicle.

203
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,938
The car goes vroom-vroom!

204
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,189
Step on it, boys!

205
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,313
Captain Dubois, I am so happy
to see you! You will not believe...

206
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,609
Get back, you fool! Your cheap cologne
is obscuring the animal musk!

207
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,986
Oh, my face!

208
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,088
Poor, poor animals.

209
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:22,176
You should never have left the forest.
Now you deal with me.

210
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,181
Kowalski, signal the chimps to meet us

211
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,391
at the rendezvous point
with the super plane.

212
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,727
Hotel ambassador. Let's move it!

213
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,402
Voilà. Giraffe at twelve o'clock.

214
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,863
Guys, we've got a tail.

215
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,615
Paparazzi!

216
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,034
Pedal to the metal, private.

217
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,994
Don't take any photos, please!

218
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,245
Hi!

219
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,122
Here I am!

220
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,043
Don't take... any... photos.

221
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,004
- No more pictures!
- Medic!

222
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,598
- Eta to rendezvous point?
- Two minutes, 37 seconds, sir.

223
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,849
Man your battle stations!

224
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,937
Hey! Wait! Nobody's at the wheel!

225
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,815
Get back there! Negative on the driver!
There's no driver!

226
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,236
Help! Nobody's driving!
Oh, no! We're going to die!

227
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,947
Don't just sit there, fancy pants.
Grab the wheel!

228
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,865
Are you kidding?
I don't drive. I'm a new yorker!

229
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,116
Move over, miss Daisy!

230
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,703
What are you doing? Zebras can't drive!
Only penguins and people can drive.

231
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,622
What do all these buttons do?

232
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,458
Help me!

233
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,710
Nice one, stripes!

234
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,719
Crazy woman gaining!

235
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,180
Our omega-3 slick will take them down.

236
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,848
Private, activate!

237
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,655
She's good!

238
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,407
Kowalski, intel.

239
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,867
Sir. We have a serious problem.

240
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,327
Captain chantal Dubois.

241
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,622
Monaco animal control.
Perfect case record.

242
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,963
You're going the wrong way, Marty!

243
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,631
Just call me Marty-o andretti.

244
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,216
No. You're sucky-o andretti!

245
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,509
Stop backseat driving!

246
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,761
I'm passenger-seat driving.
Give me the wheel.

247
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,346
It's not a wheel, it's my baby!

248
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,140
Your hoofs aren't meant to be on a wheel!

249
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,267
- Hey! Too late for you to drive!
- Don't look at me!

250
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,352
Don't look at me when we argue!
Look at the road!

251
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,770
Be cool, be cool!

252
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,523
Hi, officer. Is there a problem?

253
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,941
Hi.

254
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,195
Watch out!

255
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,452
We need more power.

256
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,830
Time to fire up
Kowalski's nucular reactor.

257
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,875
- That's a nuclear reactor?
- Nucular.

258
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,085
She's on the roof!

259
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,086
But, sir, it's not ready.

260
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,880
The control rods
will have to be calibrated.

261
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,882
And don't even ask me
about the uranium-238 blanket.

262
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,216
Ok.

263
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,934
Ok, Marty, we lost her!
Maybe you can slow down now.

264
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,478
I can't! There's no brakes!

265
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,231
No brakes?
Way to commit, soldier.

266
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,047
Let's get out of here!

267
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,924
Go, go, go! Move! Now!

268
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,760
Hey, where's everybody going?

269
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,773
I'm flying!

270
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:09,444
I'm flying!
I'm the first flying monkey!

271
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,489
Oh, yay!

272
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,032
That's our ticket out of here!

273
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,536
Yeah, baby!

274
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,229
Everybody! On the monkey chain!

275
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,023
Deploy banana gun!

276
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,668
Grab the little guys! Toss them up!
Let's go! Go, go, go! Go!

277
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,588
Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on!

278
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
Come on, melman!

279
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,431
Yeah!

280
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,432
Melman!

281
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,852
My neck!

282
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,693
Put your backs into it!
Double banana overtime!

283
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,369
Serpentine! Serpentine!

284
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,896
Hey, this lady's
really starting to freak me out.

285
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,024
Fix it, mort.

286
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,031
Hold this.

287
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,368
Alex, be careful! She's crazy!

288
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,911
You think, Marty?!

289
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,841
That's right! Home free, baby!

290
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,509
I can breathe!

291
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,845
Au revoir, Dubois!

292
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,099
Well played, lion.

293
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,142
Game on.

294
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,857
New York, new York
it's a heck of a town

295
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,276
- the bronx is up.
- But the battery's down

296
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,529
new York, new York

297
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,489
Kowalski, status report.

298
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,367
So the good news is
this song is almost over.

299
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,954
Well, that's music to my ears.
And the bad news?

300
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,248
The gear assembly is badly damaged, sir.

301
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,711
It's only a matter of time before...

302
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,556
Why can't we ever
just make a normal landing?

303
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,057
Oh, man!

304
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,227
Hold on, melman. Ok?
I'll get you down, sweetie.

305
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:34,816
Where is he?
Must find king julien. King julien!

306
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,152
It's getting hot in here

307
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,070
so take off all your fur

308
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,323
I am getting so hot

309
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,658
I want to take my fur off

310
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,285
skipper, what about the plane?

311
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:49,289
The chimps will work through the night.
No breaks, no safety restrictions.

312
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,125
Hey, where are you going?

313
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,252
Get back here! We have a contract!

314
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,006
Yes. Well, I'm afraid labor laws
are slightly more lenient in France.

315
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,884
You see, they only have to work
two weeks a year.

316
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, someone else
has the Canadian work ethic!

317
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,264
But you penguins,
you can still fix it, right? Right?

318
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,808
Yeah, yeah. You're
a little crackerjack, can-do team.

319
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,769
You want me to give it to you straight?

320
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,063
Yes! Yes! No.

321
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,481
Bend it a little?

322
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,068
Well, the plane's totaled.
Kaput, blammo, busted!

323
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,070
Never to fly again.

324
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,073
So that's it? That's it then,
we're never gonna get home?

325
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,116
No! We've got to get home!

326
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,536
We can fix it! We'll fix it!
Yeah, guys, come on, we'll fix it!

327
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,289
You just start from the outside pieces,
and you work your way in.

328
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,041
And, yeah, perfect!

329
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,127
Come on! Don't just stand there, guys.
Marty! Drag that thingy over here.

330
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:40,423
And we'll just attach it
to this dealy-Bob over here. And...

331
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,553
We're not going home.

332
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,892
We're never going home.

333
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,815
It's the fuzz!

334
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,906
What are we gonna do?
We can't hide forever!

335
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,325
And we can't just blend!
You know this ain't Africa.

336
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,327
Oh, what's the point?

337
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,998
Tell me one conceivable way
that extra-large animals like us

338
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,541
are gonna be able
to move through Europe

339
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,669
without attracting unwanted attention.

340
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,589
Hey...

341
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,427
Where are you coming from?

342
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,014
Please, you got to hide us.
Just until the heat dies down.

343
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,724
Absolut no outsiders.

344
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,351
So wipe that smirnoff your face
and Popov!

345
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,521
Come on, man. You gotta do
one cat a solid. Cat to cat.

346
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,441
Do a solid here, buddy. Come on.

347
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,695
Nyet! This train is
for circus animals only.

348
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,113
They sound like they be in trouble.

349
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:50,618
Stefano, we do not invite trouble
into our circus. I don't trust lion.

350
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,038
Hair too big and glossy!

351
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,123
Aw, come on, vitaly, you're being mean.

352
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,294
He not lion.
He lioness... with a beehive.

353
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,464
This is awkward.
We can hear everything they're saying.

354
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,508
It is not our problem!

355
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,761
No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

356
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:13,224
Just give us a minute. He's on the phone
and... can't get him off!

357
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,226
We cannot leave them there!

358
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,479
Only circus animals on this train!

359
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,649
Wait, listen! We are circus animals.
You got to let us in!

360
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,904
You are really circus?

361
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,908
Yes. Full circus!

362
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,660
My momma was circus.
My daddy was circus.

363
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,496
Gia! Shut the door!

364
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,331
Please.

365
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,500
Over there! Over there!

366
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:42,295
They are circus. Circus stick together.

367
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,370
Wow! Circus americano!

368
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,039
You must all be very famous!

369
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,083
- Yeah, we...
- Absolutely.

370
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,627
We're relatively well known...

371
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,129
But Alex is really the star.

372
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:28,299
Well, I'm not... l wouldn't say "star."
More like... well, star.

373
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,467
What is your act, Alice?

374
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,304
Well... l basically,
uh, I jump up on my rock...

375
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,932
- Rock?
- Yeah. It's a very high... rock.

376
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,934
- A really high rock!
- And then?

377
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:42,730
And then, well, I roar like...
Like a serious "rawrrr!"

378
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,316
- And then?
- And then I jump off the rock.

379
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,861
- And then?!
- And then... and then what?

380
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,279
- That is all?
- Into a pool!

381
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,322
- Full of water!
- Full of cobras!

382
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,158
Actually, it appears
like I'm jumping in to a pool...

383
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,160
- With cobras!
- Aquatic cobras.

384
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,412
For effect. But I actually pull up
at the last second.

385
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,454
- Pull up?
- Yeah.

386
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,373
- How do you do that?!
- Wire harness!

387
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,833
- Balloons!
- Jet pack!

388
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,882
I flip off the wire harness,
ignite myjet pack,

389
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,676
and then toss balloons
to the children of the world.

390
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,428
Kids love it. Kids always love that.

391
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,514
Ls this like the trapeze?

392
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,850
Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!

393
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,853
Wow! Trapeze americano!

394
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:26,274
Hey, I have a great idea!
Maybe you come with us to Roma!

395
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,486
Hey, vitaly is just playing around.
He is good, no?

396
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,946
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

397
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,573
But we're gonna get off
at the next stop

398
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:34,908
so we can get back to America.

399
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,660
That is such a coincidence!

400
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,288
Because we're going... going to...

401
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,873
Let me finish!

402
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,500
We're going to America, as well!

403
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,668
- What?!
- America?

404
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,212
- Going to America?
- What?

405
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,713
- Sí.
- Wow? When?

406
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,924
After Roma, we go to London.

407
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:55,970
And then a big-time promoter will see us
and then send us to new York.

408
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,597
They're going to new York!

409
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,557
Well, only if he likes what he sees.

410
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,435
New York? Seriously?
That's our home. That's where we live.

411
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,478
Isn't that fun?

412
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,646
- Could we go with you?
- Sure!

413
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,648
You can bunk with vitaly!

414
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,069
- Whoa!
- Or not.

415
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,321
Nyet!

416
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,572
Oh, no.

417
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,369
I don't think vitaly likes that idea.
What's he gonna do?

418
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,331
Which one of you is leader?

419
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:32,131
Tell your comrades
there is one rule we do not break!

420
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,343
Thou shalt say it and not spray it?

421
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,761
Nyet!

422
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,932
Circus owner no allow stowaways!

423
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,563
I hear you, russki.

424
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:51,109
Although, the circus owner
may allow stowaways

425
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:54,821
if the stowaways
just happen to be the owners.

426
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,615
Riddle me that.

427
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,661
What is sharply dressed
little birdie talking about?

428
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,746
Show 'em, boys.

429
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,217
You have a deal, mi amigo.

430
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:23,224
I am sure this circus
will bring you great success!

431
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,980
I guess this is good-bye and good luck!

432
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,824
What do we know about owning a circus?

433
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,869
Nothing. But it's our only shot
at getting home.

434
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,495
You better know what you're doing.

435
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,998
You're risking
private's community college fund.

436
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,667
I'll never be president.

437
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,192
Hey, this is not first class.

438
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,821
Definitely coach.

439
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,545
Mort! Stop it!

440
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,645
Hey, gorgeous.

441
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:36,232
Has anyone ever told you
that you look like a supermodel?

442
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,778
Albeit a fat, hairy one who smells.

443
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,124
You have a very hairy back.

444
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,251
I like that in a woman.

445
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,300
That's it! I'm going in.

446
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,509
Stop! It's too dangerous!

447
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,969
Don't be a hero!

448
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,644
Lion.

449
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,981
Twelve hours old.

450
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,650
Two hundred and fifty kilograms.

451
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,655
Glossy mane.
Too much conditioner.

452
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,492
Stupid bozos!

453
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,670
Hello, kitty!

454
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,342
So, you ran away with the circus.

455
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,344
What a cliché.

456
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,286
What a dump!

457
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,997
If they want to attract
a decent sports team,

458
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:19,085
they should bulldoze this rat trap
and invest in a new arena.

459
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,052
The colosseum, Marty!
The original theater-in-the-round.

460
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,055
- My ancestors used to perform here.
- No kidding!

461
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,099
Yeah. Every show had a captive audience.

462
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,601
- Apparently, they killed.
- Sounds like a great gig!

463
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,104
Trenta minuti, everybody!
Trenta minuti!

464
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,106
This is so exciting!

465
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:41,691
Remember, we just lay low.

466
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,609
Stay out of the way.
Let them do their thing.

467
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,861
Would you look at this?

468
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,822
You gotta go back
in your momma's belly,

469
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,032
'cause you're too cute
to be out here in the real world.

470
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,285
- Oi! Naff off, you muppet!
- Whoa! What the...?

471
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,287
Marty, they're professionals. Come on.

472
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,538
You look gorgeous!

473
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,207
All right, animals!
We may be your new owners,

474
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,585
but we don't want to reinvent
the circus wheel here,

475
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,461
so just go out, do what you do!

476
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,047
Just think of this as a fun warm-up
for that promoter in London.

477
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,466
Right, Marty? Marty?

478
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,302
I want to be a circus horse!

479
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,511
We could paint you white!

480
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,013
And then paint you pink!

481
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,307
- Awesome!
- Not laying very low, are we, Marty?

482
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,644
Sonya! Where is the bear?
Sonya! We're about to start!

483
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,313
Hey, vitaly!

484
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,148
Got your game face on.

485
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,150
Good game face.

486
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,068
What is that cat's problem?

487
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,738
"I'm a mean Russian cat
who isn't nice to anybody."

488
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,324
Hey, honey, look! Look, I'm doing it!

489
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,992
Guys, stop fooling around.

490
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
We're just having a little fun.

491
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,579
Let's let these animals do their show.

492
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:41,584
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus!
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, afro!

493
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,502
Circus afro circus afro

494
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,088
polka dot, polka dot, polka dot, afro!

495
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,423
Really?

496
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:50,384
Sonya! Where is sonya the bear?!

497
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:35,054
I want to kiss
every inch of your huge head.

498
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,556
It may take me a number of weeks.

499
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,893
Hey, watch it!

500
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,526
That was heavy.

501
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,988
Don't cry. Stop crying!

502
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,658
It makes me cry
to see you cry, my darling.

503
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,494
I will get you something even better.

504
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,583
Hey, you can buy love.

505
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,669
Whoa, not too fast!

506
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,345
Ladies and gentlemen,

507
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,849
presenting Gia,

508
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:23,018
the trapeze-flying Jaguar!

509
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,564
And there she go.
The triple-flip roll

510
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,984
with a double leap, and...

511
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,237
What are you doing?!

512
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,280
That's just paper.

513
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,241
Were you spying on me?

514
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,078
No! I just came by to say
that I don't want you to think...

515
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,167
I don't want you to think of me
as some sort of authority figure.

516
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,253
Don't worry. I don't.

517
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,921
- You don't?
- Not at all.

518
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,841
Well, the other circus animals
might find me a bit intimidating.

519
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,135
No. Nobody is intimidated at all by you.

520
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,679
Oh, good stuff. Good. Good news.

521
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,181
In fact, I do not think

522
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,224
they have given you a second thought
since you showed up.

523
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,350
That's good to hear.

524
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,061
If anything,
they're starting to feel sorry for you.

525
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,522
Ok, I get it. Ok?

526
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,357
Is there more?

527
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,652
I just wanted to thank you
for letting us get on the train back there.

528
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,988
I know the big cat with the accent...

529
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,199
wasn't so excited
about us getting on.

530
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,867
Look, lion guy.

531
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,953
This circus means everything to us.

532
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,582
And if you do anything
that threatens this circus,

533
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,711
you will have to answer to me. Capisce?

534
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,131
I capisce, cool. Trust me, we're cool.

535
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,976
You call this laying low?

536
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,409
Faster! Faster!

537
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,916
Where there is circus, there is lion.

538
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,961
And when in rome...

539
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,296
Vive LA France!

540
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:20,928
Halt!

541
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,936
Come on, my hairy queen.
We'll do doughnuts in the pantheon.

542
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,779
You're in big trouble.

543
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,448
Now you're really in big troub...

544
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,201
Now you're really, really in big tro...

545
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,161
I'm new!

546
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,667
Ok! Strike up the band!

547
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,168
You have a band?

548
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,882
Prepare to be blown away!

549
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,301
- Blow me away!
- Here we go!

550
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,806
Look at this. Whoa! Hey!

551
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,975
It's nice to be...

552
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,561
Yay...

553
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,231
Hey!

554
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,111
Whoa! How do dogs do that?

555
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,905
Get on with it!

556
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,159
Stupido!

557
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,762
Well, that was worth
the price of admission.

558
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,602
Watch it, mate!

559
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,438
Who's from Cincinnati?

560
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,358
Stefano, you know
"blown away" means good, right?

561
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,027
Don't worry.
The big finale is coming up!

562
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,780
Give me a downbeat! Look at this!

563
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,868
Oh, no. No, this is not happening.

564
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,162
You have a deal, mi amigo.

565
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,705
It's good, no?

566
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,376
Yes, go out and get food and come back!

567
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,885
Deep breaths.
You're in a happy place. It's all good.

568
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,720
There's an angry mob outside,

569
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,681
and they're demanding
their money back!

570
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,059
I think we all know the right thing to do.

571
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,649
Come on, come on!

572
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,234
Come on! Hurry up!

573
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,320
Hop on the train!

574
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,743
Come on, guys!

575
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,078
Mamma Mia!

576
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,663
Hurry up!

577
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,417
Grazie, Alice.

578
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,754
Just throw us the money!

579
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,351
Captain chantal Dubois. Get up.

580
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,689
I'm going to have to send you
back to Monaco under maximum security.

581
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:23,485
What?!

582
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,822
It's just a pillow!

583
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,491
That's the oldest trick
in the book, comandante.

584
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,286
Every bambino in ltaly knows that one.

585
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:36,373
Maybe, but do they know
about the old escape hole

586
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,084
behind the innocent-looking poster?

587
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:46,425
Or the really old "I'm gonna
hide up on the ceiling" trick!

588
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:53,766
Of course.

589
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,018
The secret tunnel under the bed!

590
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,686
Get this thing out of the way.

591
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,356
Let's go!

592
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,862
This secret tunnel is a dead end!

593
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,783
There's nothing but bedsprings
and mattress stuffing down here!

594
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,787
Was that the sound
of a cell door closing?

595
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:24,922
Voilà!

596
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:30,302
Was that the sound
of my hp printer printing?

597
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,814
This is a disaster!

598
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:46,151
We blow all our money on a bad circus,
and we're not any closer to new York!

599
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,736
If anything, we're further away!

600
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:51,073
We could have at least bought a circus
that knew how to circ!

601
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,660
I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

602
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,787
We had enough dough for a plane!

603
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:57,788
Are you kidding me?

604
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,456
You must have some money left over.

605
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,835
I used it to buy teeth
and then have them capped in gold.

606
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,170
Now I can eat apples!

607
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,966
Sadly, I discovered I don't like apples.

608
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,428
No promoter is sending this show
to America. It's toe up!

609
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,596
Now it all makes sense.

610
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:17,683
No wonder the circus master
was so happy to sell.

611
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:21,103
He was happy, all right.
Happy about ripping us off!

612
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,525
Where did Alex go?

613
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,734
I don't know.

614
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,705
Come on! This way!

615
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:42,207
No, no, no. You come this way!

616
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,418
Alice, watch your head!

617
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,365
Alice!

618
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,818
I'm fine!

619
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,778
Fantastic!

620
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,783
Was that trapeze americano?

621
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,951
Yeah. Sort of.

622
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:18,994
Incredible!

623
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,495
I hope this is important.

624
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,164
Come this way, Alice!

625
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,085
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like new York Knicks.

626
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,465
I know. New York kniss. Ls not hard.

627
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,217
Whoa.

628
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,519
What is this place?

629
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,397
I know you think we are
a stinky, poopy circus,

630
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,276
but there is something you must know.

631
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:54,821
There was a time
when circus zaragoza,

632
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
we were a great circus!

633
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,284
Numero uno in all the europa!

634
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:04,122
And vitaly...
He was the biggest star of us all.

635
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,293
He was fearless.
Taking risks. Always new.

636
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,546
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

637
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,852
Stefano!

638
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
Make the hoop smaller.

639
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,064
Like this?

640
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,565
Smaller.

641
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,985
- Like this?
- Good!

642
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:52,170
It had never been done before
because it was physically impossible!

643
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:56,049
And the people... they loved it!

644
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,551
Viva vitaly!

645
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,969
Smaller!

646
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,858
And the hoop, she got smaller!

647
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,067
Like the ring

648
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,780
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.

649
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,657
Bravo, vitaly!

650
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,704
He would not stop pushing.

651
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,123
And one fateful day...

652
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,792
he push too far!

653
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,920
Light the hoop on fire!

654
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:59,071
He fly too close to the sun...
And he got burned.

655
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:04,409
Literally. The extra virgin olive oil
is extra flammable.

656
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,411
And he lost everything.

657
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,790
His wife, she run off with a musician.

658
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:13,335
He lost his dignity... his fame...

659
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:17,089
his passion... and his fur.

660
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:22,094
And when it grow back, it is less soft.
More like a prickly beard.

661
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,262
Scusi. Vitaly!

662
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,932
Nothing!

663
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,936
His only passion now is the borscht.

664
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,356
Whoa.

665
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,650
He was our inspiration.

666
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:38,527
So when he lost his passion,

667
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,780
well... as vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

668
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,449
This is why we need your help.

669
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,492
What sort of help?

670
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,579
You can teach us to do new circus.
Americano style!

671
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,039
We find a new passion.

672
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:56,128
Make a new show.
And we go all the way to us and a!

673
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,764
I know. It is stupido idea.

674
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,808
We are a lost cause.

675
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,688
No, no, this isn't stupido.
This could work!

676
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,649
- What?
- What you just said.

677
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:20,777
- What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

678
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,904
- What?
- Your stupido idea!

679
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,949
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

680
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,244
No, no, no, no.
I am only average intelligence.

681
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,956
Some say I'm even slightly below.

682
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,543
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

683
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,004
I call it phase 4-7b,

684
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,214
wherein, in order to get home,

685
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,924
we will come up with something fresh,

686
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,510
something amazing,
something brand-new!

687
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,930
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

688
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,808
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

689
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,561
I missed.

690
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,606
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

691
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,192
Circus has been same for generations!

692
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,360
We make good,
classic family entertainment.

693
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,197
But last few generations,

694
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,533
families... not so entertained.

695
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,705
That's right.
Families not so entertained

696
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:16,416
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

697
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,502
It's missing passion.

698
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,297
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

699
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:26,092
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

700
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:29,221
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

701
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,182
You stopped pushing,
you stopped taking risks.

702
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,934
But those days are over.

703
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,145
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

704
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,940
Then it wouldn't be a circus, would it?

705
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,943
Circus is not about the acts you do.

706
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,654
Circus is in here.

707
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,073
How come Freddie gets all the circus?

708
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:52,953
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

709
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,207
You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

710
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,167
That's what everybody thought, vitaly,

711
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,545
until those French Canadians came along,

712
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,756
drunk off their maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

713
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,092
and completely flipped the paradigm.

714
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:12,430
Now they play Vegas.
Fifty shows a day in 52 separate venues.

715
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,683
And one of them
completely in the nude.

716
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,726
Yeah, that's right.
And you know how they did it?

717
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,853
Take off their clothes?

718
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,691
- No. They got rid of the animals.
- What?

719
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,193
- Say it ain't so!
- Che stupida! No animals...

720
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,405
- How could they?!
- Well, you know what I say to that!

721
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,824
I say they can take
the animals out of the circus,

722
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:36,830
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

723
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,084
I mean, they cannot...

724
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,461
I think you understand what I'm saying!

725
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,380
- Yeah!
- Yes!

726
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,548
No!

727
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,968
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

728
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,845
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

729
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:54,389
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

730
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,352
We'll make an all-animal circus!

731
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,772
Because if we follow our passion,
we can go anywhere.

732
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,066
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

733
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,902
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

734
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,740
- All of us!
- Yeah... yeah, yeah!

735
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,659
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

736
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,161
We're in! We'll have some of that!

737
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,662
Can I hear you say "fur power"?

738
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,414
Fur power!

739
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:22,208
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

740
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,919
You and me, baby! An act together!

741
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:25,920
I love it!

742
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,214
We can do
that funk and groove dance thing!

743
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,425
- Dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

744
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,511
Me and you! We got this!

745
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,805
But I can't dance.

746
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,223
Fur power!

747
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,768
Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

748
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,939
I do not trust this lion.

749
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,609
Vitaly, I may not trust him, either,

750
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,946
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

751
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,825
It is great tradition
of sitting, standing, rolling over.

752
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,286
You know our circus is in trouble.

753
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:03,708
This could be our last chance.
But we will not do this without you.

754
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,836
Circus always stay together.

755
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,097
Ok. I do one hoop.

756
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,892
I want a hug, too!

757
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:44,249
Attention! I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

758
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,539
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

759
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:09,542
More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

760
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,378
Are you really going
to shoot yourself out of that thing?

761
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,425
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

762
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,928
to be a human cannonball!

763
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,765
Except, you know...
A sea lion cannonball.

764
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,099
Is it dangerous?

765
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,853
Is it dangerous?
Yes, of course it's dangerous!

766
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,564
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

767
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,609
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

768
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,694
Sí. That's means yes!

769
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,154
Ready for launch?

770
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,073
Ready for launch!

771
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,910
Fire in the hole!

772
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,663
Wait!

773
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,635
Mamma Mia!

774
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,303
Help me!

775
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,182
Rico! Get the Cannon ready!
Same charge!

776
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,228
Fire in the hole!

777
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,077
All right!

778
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,675
Yeah!

779
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,641
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

780
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:52,478
I was flying! I was effin'-l-y-in'!

781
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,480
I'm proud of you, but...

782
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,358
I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

783
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,403
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry about my enthusiasm.

784
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,989
Here, wrap this around you.

785
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,496
All right, I got you! I got you!

786
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,176
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

787
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,178
I'm going to fly, baby!

788
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,847
Oh, yes! What a triumph!

789
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,225
- Hand over that circus, Freddie!
- I'll have your guts for garters!

790
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,102
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

791
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,189
Guys, chill out. Cute and cuddly's
obviously not your thing.

792
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:37,649
He's got us pegged.

793
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,567
I got a better idea. Show 'em, Rico.

794
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,823
That was great!

795
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,786
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

796
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:50,995
I want to try that!

797
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:53,081
Jonesy! Jonesy!

798
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:54,999
Hey. Hi.

799
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,377
I admire how you
have inspired these animals.

800
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,461
Thanks.

801
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,839
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

802
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,841
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

803
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,842
I know they don't rhyme.

804
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,761
Trapeze is my passion!

805
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,429
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

806
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,056
You can teach me!

807
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,516
- What?
- Teach me.

808
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,434
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

809
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,186
So that kind of rules that out.

810
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:18,272
I wonder if you actually do trapeze.

811
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,359
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

812
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,695
"Show me"? What are we, five?

813
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,613
I am five, yes.

814
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,367
Dancing.

815
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,245
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

816
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,956
I mean, the music
totally throws off my timing.

817
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,708
You want excitement?

818
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,460
Check it out. Who's on a tightrope, huh?

819
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,628
Who's on a...

820
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,383
I'm on a tightrope!
I'm on a tightrope!

821
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,843
Melman! Oh, my gosh!

822
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,636
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

823
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,555
I'm coming right now!

824
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,685
Melman?!

825
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,314
Calm down, melman.

826
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,650
I'm going to fall
and break all of my neck!

827
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,403
Just look at me. Look at me.

828
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,572
- All eyes on me.
- Ok.

829
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,657
- Come to me.
- I can't.

830
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,745
It's just like dancing, melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

831
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,331
I can't dance, ok? There, I said it.

832
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,042
Maybe because you've never tried.

833
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,335
No, I have tried.

834
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,547
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

835
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,341
You practiced? For me?

836
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,302
Yes, but it's no use.

837
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,137
I never know
what to do with my arms.

838
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,223
Hold it.

839
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,893
That part is so easy, melman. Ok?

840
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40,021
'Cause all you have to do
is put them around your partner.

841
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,357
See? Two steps forward.

842
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,193
One step back.

843
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,029
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

844
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:51,115
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

845
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,950
I'm dancing!

846
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,038
Ok.

847
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,874
All right.

848
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,377
So when do we get
the jet packs and aquatic cobras?

849
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,255
This is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

850
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,590
Ok, how do we begin?

851
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,926
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

852
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,471
the whole pitch and yaw...
Arc and gravity.

853
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,725
All that stuff,
which I won't bore you with. Ok.

854
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,602
- Do you need a push?
- No.

855
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,105
Just watch and learn!

856
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:33,407
Like that?

857
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,701
That's one way of doing it, sure.

858
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,629
You use a net!

859
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,507
Yes! Trapeze americano. We use the net.

860
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,305
Trapeze americano!

861
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,447
Look at him go!

862
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,714
Wow!

863
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,057
E bravo! Bravissima!

864
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:44,061
Hey, vitaly,
maybe you even do two hoops, no?

865
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,067
Señorita bell-bottoms.

866
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,528
Tenemos una problema Grande.

867
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,989
¿Qué? ¿Qué Grande problema?

868
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,495
Oh, no! She's onto us!

869
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,748
Don't make it any easier on the psycho.

870
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,626
- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

871
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,920
But we're not ready.
We're in the middle of rehearsals.

872
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,379
Then why don't you lilt over,

873
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,674
grab your peduncle,
and kiss new York good-bye?

874
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,927
Are you sure we are ready?

875
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,763
Of course we're ready! Born ready!
Ready steady! Come on, let's go!

876
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,181
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

877
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:24,101
All right, you heard the cat.
Move it! Come on! All aboard!

878
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,229
Grab your luggage
and drain your bladders.

879
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,439
It's going to be a long ride!

880
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,866
All right, everybody,
let's blow that promoter away!

881
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,451
London, here we come!

882
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:43,287
Sunshiny London, yes!

883
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:07,311
Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly!

884
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:37,383
Come on, come on, come on.
Where is he?

885
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,052
Bingo!

886
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,806
If that's not a red-blooded
American promoter, I don't know what is.

887
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,476
We need to get this show on the road.
Private! Tell them the eagle has landed.

888
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,978
The eagle has landed!

889
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,647
Roger that.
And keep an eye out for Dubois.

890
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:52,648
Aye, aye, guvnor!

891
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:54,233
The promoter is in the house!

892
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,860
New York is closer than ever!

893
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:57,111
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

894
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,488
First, we got a circus to do.
We're on, folks!

895
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,074
- Do we go on before or after the dogs?
- Yes.

896
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,993
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

897
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,746
- Where's vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

898
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,541
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen vitaly?

899
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,710
Hey.

900
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,422
Stefano, why the sad little face?

901
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:19,300
Vitaly... he will not go on!

902
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,301
What?

903
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,386
I tried everything I could.

904
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:27,099
Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

905
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,686
Where is he?
I'm sure I can reason with him.

906
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,648
Vitaly, what are you doing?

907
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,941
You missed.

908
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,236
You're leaving? You're just gonna
walk out on everybody?

909
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,113
They have good show without me.

910
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,450
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

911
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,118
You get fake foot, then you walk.

912
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,704
I don't want fake foot! Ok?

913
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,375
What happened to "circus stick together"?
"The show must go on."

914
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:53,876
Clichés.

915
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,213
Come on, man.
Stop being this guy! Be the other guy!

916
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,547
What other guy?

917
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,759
The guy who was all circus!
The guy who jumped through hoops!

918
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,428
Give me that!
The guy everybody looked up to.

919
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:10,643
Come on. Where's that vitaly?

920
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,980
That vitaly is no more.

921
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,818
Listen, man.
You may have given up on yourself,

922
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,404
but your friends
haven't given up on you.

923
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,989
Are you just going
to turn your back on them,

924
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,742
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

925
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:31,455
Or are you gonna get out there
and jump through that tiny little hoop?

926
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,501
It is impossible.

927
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,466
It was always impossible, vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

928
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,014
That is why I loved it.

929
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:53,519
Because I did the impossible!

930
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,189
I was once a brave tiger.

931
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,693
And if I go down in flames...

932
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,778
so be it!

933
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:07,575
You know, I think
I might have an idea for you.

934
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:22,047
Light the hoop on fire!

935
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,238
Mamma Mia, Santa Maria, Santa Maria...

936
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:52,077
Mamma Maria, Mia Santa,
Santa Mia farrow...

937
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:54,705
Come on, you got it.

938
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,675
Yes!

939
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,644
All right, what are you waiting for?
We got a show to put on.

940
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,562
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go!

941
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,830
Look!

942
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,859
We're going to America!

943
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,694
Today!

944
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,530
That's what I call crack-a-lackin'
to the mack-a-lackin'!

945
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,199
- We did it, Alice!
- Yeah!

946
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,534
Maybe I am
average intelligence after all!

947
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,828
Perhaps even slightly above.

948
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,373
No, I don't think so.

949
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,043
Hair conditioner. Great idea, my friend!

950
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,712
Feel. Go ahead. Soft like kitten, no?

951
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,255
Look at that.

952
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,465
Slippery but not flammable.

953
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,718
You smell like peaches and herb!

954
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,556
Gia and Alex, the trapezing cats!

955
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,016
We did pretty good.

956
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,810
You will flip, and I will catch.

957
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,104
And sometimes I will flip,
and you will catch.

958
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,817
And then we will both flip,
and we'll travel the whole world!

959
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,903
Flipping and catching,
and I will flip you...

960
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,660
You know, the thing is...

961
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,330
I may not always be around.

962
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,415
Where are you going?

963
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,709
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm...

964
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,088
Bravo, bravo!

965
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:35,259
What a heartwarming performance,
monsieur circus master.

966
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,553
It brought tears to my eyes.

967
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:39,596
No, not really.

968
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:44,017
Monsieur, we both know
the lion does not belong to you.

969
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,769
It's that horrid woman!

970
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,689
He is a fugitive from justice.

971
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,524
You will turn the lion over to me

972
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,277
so that I may put him
where he belongs.

973
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,823
On my wall.

974
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,538
- What?
- Incoming!

975
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:12,838
Outgoing!

976
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:13,839
Wait!

977
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,636
Up high!

978
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,305
Down low. Too slow.

979
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,056
- Well done, private.
- Did I do good?

980
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,767
Nah, not really.

981
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,311
Man, that was close!

982
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,812
Alex?

983
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,315
You are from a zoo?

984
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:39,531
Yes. Yes. But wait, there's more.

985
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,366
- More?
- Or less. There's less.

986
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,494
You were never circus?

987
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,579
We had to say we were circus.

988
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,372
Or you'd never have let us on the train!

989
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,001
After all we have
been through together...

990
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:53,670
you want to go live in a zoo?

991
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,714
- Gia, I...
- You used us.

992
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,257
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...

993
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:59,802
Trapeze americano,
you make that up, too?

994
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,429
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.

995
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:06,934
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.

996
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:11,188
Balloons to the children of the world
was not real, either?

997
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,482
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.

998
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,694
I was shot out of a Cannon!
I could have died!

999
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,364
But I thought it was
your lifelong dream.

1000
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:25,285
For all I know,
your name is not even Alice.

1001
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:29,248
No, Stefano, but it never really was.

1002
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,208
I don't feel safe!

1003
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,462
Gia, I...

1004
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,382
We trusted you.

1005
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,303
My tears are real!

1006
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,805
You are not!

1007
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:52,062
I can't believe you lied
to all us circus folk.

1008
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,067
Me? Stay with the circus?

1009
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:02,322
I am a king! I want to rule new York!
We should talk.

1010
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:04,700
Whoa!

1011
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,830
Stop it! No means no!
Or in your language...

1012
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,084
Not everything
is solved that way, you know.

1013
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,466
Sonya? Are you listening to me?

1014
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,761
Now I'm getting
the silent treatment, am I?

1015
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,097
Come over here, right now!

1016
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:31,184
Don't shut me out, baby!

1017
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,020
What is wrong with you? Speak!

1018
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:40,736
Ok... if these are your feelings,
I understand now.

1019
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:42,571
And I'm going!

1020
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,367
It's obvious I'm just an emotional
whoopee cushion for you to sit on!

1021
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,495
When you look for where I am,

1022
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,623
I won't be there!

1023
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,692
Come, everybody.
We have show to do.

1024
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,071
But how do I go on without Marty?

1025
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,073
- Stefano.
- I don't know what to do.

1026
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,533
You can still do Cannon solo.

1027
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:33,246
But... l want to do solo act with Marty!

1028
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,457
And what do I do?

1029
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,419
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?

1030
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,588
No.

1031
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,175
We can do impossible!

1032
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,553
And we never go back
to way we used to be.

1033
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,057
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.

1034
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:57,562
And it won't be the same without them,
whatever way it is.

1035
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,793
Well... we're here.

1036
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,630
Home.

1037
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,635
My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.

1038
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,304
Look at the mural.

1039
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,308
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?

1040
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,644
Wow.

1041
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:42,649
I forgot about that wall
in between us, melman.

1042
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,360
Was that always there?

1043
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:55,328
Guys, I'm sorry
I ever left the zoo in the first place.

1044
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,997
What do you mean?

1045
01:12:57,165 --> 01:13:00,000
I mean, if I had just stayed put,

1046
01:13:00,168 --> 01:13:03,086
we wouldn't have
anything to be sad about right now.

1047
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:09,760
Leaving the zoo was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1048
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,679
Really?

1049
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,892
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.

1050
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,435
- Yeah!
- Lt was exciting!

1051
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,729
- It was romantic.
- Lt was dangerous.

1052
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,397
I never felt so alive!

1053
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:25,859
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.

1054
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,362
I only wish we'd realized that sooner.

1055
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,991
I'm really going to miss those guys.

1056
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,703
What do you say we go back?

1057
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:37,704
Really?

1058
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,122
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!

1059
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,791
But what do we tell them?

1060
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,919
We make it right by telling them
how wrong we were.

1061
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:44,920
It's worth a shot.

1062
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:48,298
And if we go down in flames, so be it!

1063
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:49,966
- Yes, let's do this!
- I like it!

1064
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,218
Yeah, yeah!

1065
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,762
Ls my neck getting longer?

1066
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,889
Feel my fur. It's so soft.

1067
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:57,641
It is soft.

1068
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:02,395
I'm like a candy cane
in a black and white movie.

1069
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,731
Oh, no.

1070
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,733
Dubois.

1071
01:14:07,068 --> 01:14:11,363
Sonya, I miss you, baby!
I miss my stinky bear!

1072
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,533
Babe... your fishy kisses!

1073
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,577
Surprise!

1074
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,165
He will never fit in the carry-on.

1075
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,709
But his head will!

1076
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:27,504
- Hey!
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?

1077
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:29,881
Look! Look what she's done!

1078
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,008
You brought back Alex the lion!

1079
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,928
- It's a miracle!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1080
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,763
Sonya, where are you?

1081
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,682
Sonya!

1082
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,016
Excuse me.

1083
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,146
Sonya, baby!

1084
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,189
I don't want to be king anymore!

1085
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,692
I was so hung up on who I was...

1086
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,528
who you was...
What you smelled like...

1087
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:56,032
when all that really matters
is what we smell like together.

1088
01:14:58,536 --> 01:14:59,870
I know!

1089
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:01,705
Baby, forgive me.

1090
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:03,290
Oh, hello?

1091
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,708
Gasp! It's Dubois!

1092
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:05,876
Baba booey!

1093
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:08,003
Where did you get this?

1094
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,129
I got it from the zoo.

1095
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,173
The hippies got ambushed!

1096
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,300
What? We have to help them!

1097
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:14,593
But they lied to us!

1098
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,261
Yeah. Why should we lift a paw?

1099
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:17,929
They are our friends!

1100
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,639
They're not even circus!

1101
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,726
That's bolshevik!

1102
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:28,607
I never thought I'd say this
on American soil, but the russki's right!

1103
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,074
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1104
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,159
Oh, no.

1105
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:40,452
Alex?

1106
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,037
Where are you?

1107
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,164
Gloria! Are you ok?

1108
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:47,042
- What is happening?
- Alex!

1109
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,336
- No, no! No, no!
- Alex the lion!

1110
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,004
No!

1111
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:02,182
Thank you. Thank you all for coming
to this special celebration.

1112
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,393
And now, the woman
who made this all possible,

1113
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,729
who brought Alex the lion
and a couple of...

1114
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,231
three?

1115
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,816
Three other animals back to new York.

1116
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,610
And she's French.

1117
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,613
Please welcome chantal Dubois!

1118
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,354
Alex?

1119
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,616
It was never about the money.

1120
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,953
It was about...

1121
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,872
the lion.

1122
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:20,844
- Gia?
- Circus stick together.

1123
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:26,808
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus
da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, afro

1124
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,644
circus afro, circus afro
polka dot, polka dot!

1125
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,855
Look! A flying circus!

1126
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,356
No!

1127
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,364
Operation afro-circus rescue... engage!

1128
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:42,907
Aye, aye, skipper!

1129
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,702
Unleash the seal.

1130
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,496
- I am a sea lion!
- Whatever.

1131
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:56,087
Two tons of fun. Dive, dive, dive!

1132
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:02,969
Let's rock.

1133
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,679
You and me, baby!

1134
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,158
Wow!

1135
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,210
Suck in that gut!

1136
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:40,256
I am impressed!

1137
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,978
Mission accomplished.
Now let's get out of here!

1138
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,439
- Wait! Wait for me!
- Stefano!

1139
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,525
Don't leave without me!

1140
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,407
Oh, no!

1141
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,497
Go, Stefano!

1142
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,416
Climb!

1143
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,173
Come on, my friend!

1144
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,717
Stefano!

1145
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,220
Help me!

1146
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,098
I will have your head!

1147
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,641
Oh, no! Help me!

1148
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,059
Alex!

1149
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,234
Marty! Shoot me a line.

1150
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:44,737
You got it. Afro, don't fail me now!

1151
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,659
What are you doing?

1152
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:52,328
We are doing trapeze americano.

1153
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,164
Let's do it!

1154
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:57,250
- Frankie, jonesy! Be ready!
- You got it, boss!

1155
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:58,751
Go, go, go!

1156
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,681
Gia! Take Stefano!

1157
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,932
Alex!

1158
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:26,154
Aquatic cobras!

1159
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,533
If I am going down,
your head is coming with me!

1160
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,452
I don't think so!

1161
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,162
Oi, let's go!

1162
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:38,124
You're going down,
but not with my head.

1163
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,338
Jet pack! He pull up!

1164
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:46,299
Your days of chasing animals
are over, Dubois!

1165
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,551
Because you've just messed
with the king!

1166
01:20:57,186 --> 01:21:00,188
This is where animals like you belong!
Now sit!

1167
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,149
Lie down.

1168
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:05,318
Naughty me.

1169
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:06,653
Roll over.

1170
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:09,614
Good, Dubois.

1171
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,032
Now stay!

1172
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,416
We did it!

1173
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,383
Balloons to the children of the world!

1174
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,343
Trapeze americano!

1175
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:33,054
- It is real.
- It's real!

1176
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,773
That's how you do it!

1177
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,361
So you want to run away with the circus?

1178
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,114
- Live a life of adventure?
- Full of romance?

1179
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:53,449
- And danger!
- Really living!

1180
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,034
What do you say?

1181
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:00,123
Ra-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, circus!

1182
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:02,792
Da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, afro!

1183
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,879
Circus afro, circus afro!
Polka dot, polka dot, polka dot, afro!

1184
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,466
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

1185
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:13,386
I like to move it, move it
you like to...

1186
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:14,929
Move it!

1187
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:21,394
Skipper, what did you end up doing
with the crazy lady, anyway?
