1
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,686
HANHO EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR

2
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,647
What is it now?

3
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,400
Dad won’t give me
the gallery in Cheongdam-dong.

4
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,444
So annoying.

5
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,532
So what?

6
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,618
I told you not to wear that tie clip!

7
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,954
Good morning, boss.

8
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:15,904
What?

9
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,489
About the Jungwoon district mall,

10
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,075
we got rid of most of the tenants,

11
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,745
but the carpenter’s shop is holding out.

12
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,336
Mr. Choe...
You’ve been doing this for how long?

13
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,007
It's been 21 years since I started out
in liquor distribution.

14
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,263
You haven't forgotten what we're about
now that we're wearing a tie, have you?

15
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,015
-Mr. Bang.
-Yes, boss.

16
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,231
Take the boys and wrap up
the Jungwoon case.

17
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,274
Right away.

18
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,748
Is something wrong, sir?

19
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,500
Of course not.

20
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,086
I’m going to go for a smoke.

21
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,009
Told you there are plenty here
to use as weapons.

22
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,179
Pros need professional gear.

23
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,266
Mr. Kim Jong-gi?

24
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,434
Hand up.

25
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,525
Mr. Kim Jong-gi?

26
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,486
This is illegal.

27
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,698
I can exercise my right to retention.

28
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,784
You can discuss your rights
with the boss later.

29
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,831
All I need is a signature from you
and we can all go out to lunch.

30
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,959
I’ll count to three.

31
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,129
One...

32
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,341
Two...

33
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,387
Three.

34
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,827
Look who it is!

35
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,454
If it isn't brother Jang!

36
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,831
Aren’t you more used to gukbap?

37
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,462
I need to grease my intestines too,
every now and then.

38
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,923
Why are you here eating by yourself?

39
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,342
Where’s your wife?

40
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,719
That's none of your business, Mr. Yang.

41
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,347
Hand over the rights
to Chungdo Precision to me.

42
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,184
I worked on that place
for six whole months.

43
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,270
Not because Osung Logistics
didn’t work out for you?

44
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,563
What is it?

45
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,234
Do you want to get down and dirty
in the age of IT?

46
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,155
You went to a good school,
why not be more civil?

47
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,823
So what?

48
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:08,743
What?

49
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,455
You smart prick.

50
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,290
But you know what?

51
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,794
The word "IT" sounds so tacky
coming out of your mouth.

52
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,047
You son of a bitch.

53
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,094
Do you still see me
as your ass-kissing lackey?

54
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,097
You couldn’t even wax my shoe properly.

55
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,892
Do you think you can handle me?

56
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,353
Of course not.

57
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,816
Who can handle that mug of yours?
No one can.

58
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,616
Let’s go have some gukbap!

59
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,125
Yes, it’s me.

60
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,093
Will Chungdo Precision be okay with it?

61
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,556
With private funding,
we will have the controlling stake.

62
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,352
I heard Dong-cheol's men
were working on the Chungdo case.

63
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,479
We were there first.

64
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,731
He won't be able
to say a thing when we make the move.

65
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,276
Don’t forget.

66
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,405
Gangsters always live
with a knife to their necks.

67
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,996
It took us 18 years to get this far.

68
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,373
Congratulations, sir.

69
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,960
"Congratulations"?

70
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,672
It's too early for that.

71
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,597
Where are you going, sir?

72
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,265
To receive grace.

73
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,360
HOPE DINER

74
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,374
My, my.

75
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,422
Aren’t you a bit overdressed
to be having mackerel ramen?

76
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,012
A young woman ran this shop
ten years ago, has it changed owners?

77
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,264
She’s dead.

78
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,939
Eat up, kiddo. Okay?

79
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,831
Check, please.

80
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,917
Why haven't you eaten?

81
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,962
Doesn't it taste
just like you remember it?

82
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,464
Just let me pay.

83
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,053
You don’t like eating alone, is that it?

84
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,681
How do you not have anyone

85
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,142
-to eat with at your age?
-What? I’ll be right there.

86
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,103
It's so sad.

87
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,854
How much is it?

88
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,697
Ma’am, I’m really sorry
but I've lost my wallet.

89
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,701
That’s okay.
This gentleman will pay for it.

90
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,035
What?

91
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,247
-Take care.
-I’m in a rush.

92
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,667
-Thank you!
-Don’t worry, see you.

93
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,377
-Get going!
-Hey!

94
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,379
-Hey, you!
-Take care, kiddo.

95
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,716
Sir, are you ready to pay?

96
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,678
That will be 10,000 won per dish,
totaling 50,000 won.

97
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,472
How can you charge 10,000 won
for a bowl of ramen?

98
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,308
And how is it 50,000 won?

99
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,937
That fat son of a...

100
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:11,235
I'll make it up to you later
with a little gift.

101
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,157
A successful man such as yourself
can afford to be generous.

102
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,495
HOPE DINER

103
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,940
I’m never coming back to this shithole.

104
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,459
It’s me.

105
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,044
Did you look into Dong-cheol's gang?

106
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:30,606
Jeez, where am I?

107
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:38,364
Right, something fell on me
and I fainted...

108
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,707
Kid.

109
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,125
What? What kid?

110
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,209
Are you awake?

111
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,378
What’s she saying?

112
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,047
Why is she calling me a kid?

113
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,675
-What the...?
-Don’t force yourself to speak.

114
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,468
I'll go get the doctor.

115
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,193
-You’re up?
-What? You know me?

116
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,445
Are you okay, kid?

117
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,613
Who are they calling a "kid"?

118
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,286
What the hell?

119
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,882
Why am I lying here?

120
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,966
You there.

121
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,303
You shouldn’t be walking around like that.
Please return to your room.

122
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,763
Your father’s on his way,

123
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,181
-so please wait.
-My father's dead.

124
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,349
-Dong-hyun!
-There he is.

125
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,851
-Dong-hyun!
-Who's the baldy?

126
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,145
Son, I thought you would never wake up!

127
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,271
-"Son"?
-I was so worried.

128
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,190
Are you okay?

129
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,108
Please, Dong-hyun.

130
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,568
What are they...?

131
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,284
This is a mirror...

132
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,041
I don’t believe this.

133
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,462
Amnesia?

134
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,547
Yes.

135
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,968
It looks like he's suffering
from retrograde amnesia.

136
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,680
Does that affect his speech pattern?

137
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,225
His tone of speech has changed completely.

138
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:34,230
Brain injuries sometimes cause patients
to mistake their identity.

139
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,149
Their behavior and speech patterns
could change in such cases.

140
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,902
It’s Dad, don't you recognize me?

141
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,739
Let go! How many times do I have
to tell you that I'm not your son?

142
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,910
What’s with my voice?

143
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,376
What was his personality like before?

144
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,127
Well, he liked to eat.

145
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,673
But he never got into fights.

146
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,134
-Gentle?
-Yes.

147
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,933
A high school student?

148
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,650
That’s okay.

149
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,403
-This gentleman will pay for it.
-What?

150
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,905
Could he be the kid from...

151
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
And...

152
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,205
I'll make it up to you later
with a little gift.

153
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,915
That old fart?

154
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,342
What the...?

155
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm telling you, that diner
went out of business a long time ago.

156
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,475
I ate ramen here yesterday.
How many times do I have to tell you?

157
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,437
Was it that good?

158
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,023
Is that why you're asking?

159
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:06,447
Around 5 p.m. yesterday, a 17-year-old
high school student jumped off a building

160
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,743
and fell on a man in his forties, causing
the man to go into a vegetative state.

161
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:16,332
It seems that Mr. Jang is in a coma
after being crushed by a falling kid.

162
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,125
Jang Pan-su?

163
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,423
Incredible!

164
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,932
That damn woman...

165
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,685
Where the hell has she gone now?

166
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,196
Damn it.

167
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,782
This is my favorite necklace.

168
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,911
Its ring is broken.

169
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,704
Jeez...

170
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,332
Who are you?

171
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,085
Yes, I am...

172
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,836
I’m Pan-su.

173
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,505
Your husband Jang Pan-su.

174
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,383
-You're not going to believe it,
-Stay back!

175
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,009
-but I’ll explain everything.
-Stay back!

176
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
-Please take a seat.
-Police!

177
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,721
Will you listen to me?

178
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,557
-What are you doing?
-Get away from me!

179
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,560
I’m really Pan-su.

180
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,355
I’ll prove it, so put that down.

181
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,899
If you’re Pan-su,
then I’m your mom, you fatso!

182
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,484
How did you know the door passcode?

183
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,111
Did you escape from a looney bin?

184
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,863
I’ll explain everything, so put that down.

185
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,115
No way! Stay back!

186
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,616
Han Suh-yeon!

187
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,909
Listen to me!

188
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,286
Hold still!

189
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,955
Let me go! This is my home!

190
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,998
Don’t move!

191
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,374
ARRESTED FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING

192
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,334
Why did you break into that house?

193
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,462
Were you going to steal some food?

194
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,798
Listen, Copper. What did you just--

195
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,508
Wait! Dong-hyun!

196
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,803
My son may be big-boned,

197
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,723
but he’s not the type
to steal other people’s food.

198
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,517
He's not himself lately
because he injured his head recently.

199
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,186
He must’ve mistaken the place
for our home, right?

200
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,314
We're releasing him with just a warning,
since he's a minor.

201
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,984
We won't let him off easy next time.

202
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,736
Of course! My apologies.

203
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,320
I’ll teach him properly.

204
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:14,074
Dong-hyun, come on. Sorry, officer.

205
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,505
Come out, you bastard.

206
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,136
This doesn’t work.

207
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,929
I got it.

208
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,264
Huh? I'm sorry.

209
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,730
Hey, prick! What are you doing to my boss?

210
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,273
It’s not what you think.

211
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,649
Then what?

212
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,443
Did Mr. Yang send you?

213
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,738
You son of a... Wait a minute.

214
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,407
You fat... It’s you!

215
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,909
You fat ass!

216
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,661
You crushed my boss with your fat ass!

217
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,081
So savage!

218
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,751
Bring my boss back! Wake him up!

219
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,836
I understand how you feel.

220
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,338
Let go.

221
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,298
Don't order me around, you brat!

222
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,591
What’s going on?

223
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,675
This is an ICU!

224
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,676
We'll talk later.

225
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,345
Hey! Fat ass!

226
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,973
If I catch you again,
I’ll smoke and grill you!

227
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,568
APARTMENT A

228
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,987
Come in.

229
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,534
Thank you for your hospitality.

230
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,037
I’ll leave as soon as I find
a place of my own.

231
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,623
This is your home, Dong-hyun.

232
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,209
Why do you keep saying
that you're going to leave?

233
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,504
Do you have a job?

234
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,297
What?

235
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,757
I used to.

236
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,927
I'm working part-time
at a grocery store for now.

237
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,887
Wait.

238
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,894
You should take better care of yourself.

239
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,123
Go ahead and eat, son.

240
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,087
I have to eat all of this by myself?

241
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,759
It's only half of what you eat usually,
but I can cook more if you want.

242
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,888
You must be mistaken.

243
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,432
I don’t eat instant or junk food.

244
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,767
Give it a try.

245
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,770
These are your favorites.

246
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,609
Here, for the sake of my effort.

247
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,170
What’s wrong?

248
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,886
See? You love it.

249
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,523
I love that you eat so well, my dear son.

250
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,819
It's greasy.

251
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,617
Get some sleep

252
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,036
and we’ll go to school tomorrow.

253
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,705
School?

254
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,542
I have to go and find out
what actually happened.

255
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,129
I'm not going to let
something like this slide.

256
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,091
How dare they do this to my son.

257
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,386
Mr. Vice-principal.

258
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,304
Hello.

259
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,140
Good to meet you, I’m Jang...

260
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,852
I mean, Kim Dong-hyun.

261
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,230
Dong-hyun injured his head.

262
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,732
I see.

263
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,442
-Please sit down.
-Yes, sir.

264
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,162
Dong-hyun, over here.

265
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:29,222
I’ve been told that Dong-hyun
can’t remember what happened that day.

266
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,435
Did something happen at school?

267
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,730
He’s not someone
who would attempt suicide.

268
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,440
Maybe he had a reason--

269
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:44,529
Are you implying that
other students did something to him?

270
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,742
Well, who knows?

271
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,662
Mr. Kim.

272
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,499
I’ve told the police already...

273
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,959
nothing like that happened.

274
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,923
Hey, I’ll look into it.

275
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,800
Why don't you go home, old man?

276
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,010
What?

277
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,888
Vice-principal, right?

278
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,183
I'll be returning to class
starting from today.

279
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,192
Quiet!

280
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,822
Dong-hyun’s not fully himself
due to the accident,

281
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,533
so please help him out until he recovers.

282
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,826
Yes, ma’am.

283
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,702
Go take a seat.

284
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,181
Do you know how hard I had it
while you were away?

285
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,017
All right. Open your books.

286
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,771
Jae-ik, share your book with Dong-hyun.

287
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,318
Page 111.

288
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,616
What does "adjust" mean here?

289
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,535
To alter or adapt, right?

290
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:18,123
Then the correct answer is D.

291
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,813
Imagine how I feel.

292
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,067
Where’s mine?

293
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,403
-So cute.
-What a cutie.

294
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,571
It’s Hyun-jung.

295
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,367
Why aren't you eating?

296
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,120
-Too bland?
-It’s not good enough for her.

297
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,916
That looks delicious.

298
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,459
Now it's properly seasoned. Try it.

299
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,586
-Go on, try it.
-Eat.

300
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,636
She's got such a poker face.
There's no reaction at all.

301
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,850
Stop it. Please.

302
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,565
-"Stop it."
-"Please."

303
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,738
-Sorry. My bad.
-Look at her.

304
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,242
Hey, you kids.

305
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,536
Let me eat in peace.

306
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,746
So, eat, fatso!

307
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,873
-Why is he asking for our permission?
-Unbelievable.

308
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,418
He must be really hungry.

309
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,343
Is this for real?

310
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,305
This loser must have lost his mind
because of his injury.

311
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,599
"Loser"?

312
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,435
Should I help you remember?

313
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:03,853
Hey!

314
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,855
What are you doing over there?

315
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,150
Those bastards.

316
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,653
See me after school.

317
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,417
Wow, he really came.

318
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,295
-Go easy on him, Tae-wook.
-Don’t kill him.

319
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,472
Who are you?

320
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,016
"Who are you"?

321
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,602
Are you sure you don’t remember anything?

322
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,479
Why are you talking like an old man?

323
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,482
Hey.

324
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,736
Nothing’s changed, so listen carefully.

325
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,488
Come see me every break time.

326
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,991
Bring me a burger and strawberry milk.

327
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:04,080
Could it be that I was,
as you kids like to call it,

328
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,292
a "delivery boy" or something like that?

329
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,838
Has something happened between us?

330
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,634
Do you need a beating?
Maybe that will help you remember!

331
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,055
-You bastard!
-Sorry.

332
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,890
I don’t like getting hit.

333
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,308
You crazy bastard!

334
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,437
Not again! Damn it!

335
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,480
Wait!

336
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,400
I have a question.

337
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:39,699
Did this Dong-hyun kid...

338
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,953
do anything to personally offend you?

339
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,081
Listen to this guy.

340
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,249
There’s no such a thing, you fat ass!

341
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,211
So...

342
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,505
That means...

343
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,467
-he was an easy target?
-Yeah.

344
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,720
You're not just easy.
You are way too fucking easy!

345
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,930
Do you understand now?

346
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,562
Did you start getting boxing lessons?

347
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,481
You've become so healthy suddenly.

348
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,025
Hey, Dong-hyun!

349
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,443
Are you okay?

350
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,697
-Are you okay?
-I’m fine.

351
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,074
-You bastard!
-Hey! Stop!

352
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,618
Let me go!

353
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,840
You rat.

354
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,888
You saw everything yesterday, right?

355
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
I didn’t see anything.

356
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,811
Do you want to die, you prick?

357
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,730
I’ll kill you if you’re lying.

358
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,189
Hey.

359
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,774
He’s got quite a package.

360
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,694
Let’s strip him down
and film him for insurance.

361
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,404
That’s a good idea.

362
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,239
No, please!

363
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,325
This isn’t what friends do to each other!

364
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,744
What did this idiot say?

365
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,203
Strip him.

366
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,121
Hold still now.

367
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,581
-Here we go.
-Wait a minute!

368
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,207
-Don’t move.
-Please don’t!

369
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:13,877
Dong-hyun.

370
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,651
Give it back, you fat ass!

371
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,236
What?

372
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,530
Give it back while I'm telling you nicely.

373
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,991
Is there something I shouldn’t see?

374
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,242
Give it to me!

375
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,787
Are you all right?

376
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,664
I’ll return it tomorrow.

377
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,832
What do we do?

378
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,209
You promise? Tomorrow!

379
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,603
This is Kim Dong-hyun,
how about a comment?

380
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,775
I just have to return the shoe, right?

381
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,277
Yes.

382
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,863
We won’t bother Hyun-jung again.
I promise.

383
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:29,452
But you have to walk all the way
down that rail to get her shoe.

384
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,162
Then it’s mission clear.

385
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,997
-What the...?
-What's she doing here?

386
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,667
Dong-hyun! Stop!

387
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,044
He’s going to get your shoe back.

388
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,838
It’s too dangerous!

389
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,548
-"It’s too dangerous!"
-It's not dangerous.

390
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,434
And I was right below?

391
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,696
Did I tell you to delete the video or not?

392
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,990
That loser won’t do anything.

393
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,992
Hey, kiddos!

394
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,045
You fat ass, give me my phone!

395
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,596
It was an interesting video.

396
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:32,932
So what?

397
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,269
Are you going to tell the cops?

398
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,150
It seems you've got some crazy ideas
since you hurt your head.

399
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,113
I’m not a big fan of cops either.

400
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,242
Nor am I a fan of poking my nose
in other people’s affairs.

401
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,785
Other people’s affairs?

402
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,415
I made a copy, as insurance.

403
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,676
Stay out of my sight from now on.

404
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,095
Got it?

405
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,796
They're finally here!

406
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,966
Damn, I almost died waiting!

407
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,802
Mrs. Jang! Good evening.

408
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,053
Mr. Yang?

409
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,389
Mr. Choe. How have you been?

410
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,015
You forgot to zip up.

411
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,267
Just kidding.

412
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,524
What are you trying to pull?

413
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,651
Hey, bring me the goods.

414
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,948
My boys took a lot of photos of you two,

415
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,368
so I was going to send them
to Chairman Han.

416
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,578
This is nasty.
You didn't have to go that far.

417
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,915
You know how much the chairman
hates affairs and stuff like that.

418
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,292
He’s got a strange moral compass.

419
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,253
What should I do with this?

420
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,921
What is it that you want?

421
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,109
Who ordered you to guard him?

422
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,986
You fat ass!

423
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,865
Didn’t I tell you I would grill you?

424
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,576
Do you want to be marinated?

425
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,376
-You little...
-Bang Man-cheol.

426
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,753
Age 43.

427
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,005
Went to Samil High School
and Dongbang Community College.

428
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,966
Began working for the Hanho Group
on October 21, 2001.

429
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,053
Promoted to supervisor
in February 2004. Currently single.

430
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,763
How did you know?

431
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,474
Because I’m Jang Pan-su.

432
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,771
What a load of bull,
my boss is over there.

433
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,938
That scar on your eye.

434
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,817
Stabbed with a broken bottle
on my behalf at 11 p.m., March 21, 2005.

435
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:35,406
Received 20 stitches at Jinsung Hospital,
costing me 385,200 won.

436
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,367
How did you...?

437
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,840
It seems that I've received
the wrong kind of grace.

438
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,930
MALL SPACE FOR SALE AND RENT

439
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,064
You sure eat a lot.

440
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,692
My appetite won’t die down.

441
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,620
-What is it?
-Those eyes...

442
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,916
You really are my boss.

443
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,210
My apologies.

444
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,048
When else would I ever get the chance
to touch your face?

445
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,885
Why are you guarding me every day
when no one's ordered you to?

446
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:44,433
There’s a rumor that Mr. Yang
is planning to move in on us.

447
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,812
They say that he's after your life.

448
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,073
Don’t worry.

449
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,242
I’ll return to my body.

450
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:02,994
No matter what.

451
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,537
But you shouldn’t.

452
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,330
What?

453
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,916
You obtained a fresh new body.

454
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,549
Having to serve in the military again
is a drawback,

455
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:21,387
but it’s better than being stuck
in a vegetative state.

456
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:29,770
Put that down.

457
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,864
Meet us at Burger Prince
after seventh period, okay?

458
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,616
The one at the intersection.

459
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,576
We have some proposals.

460
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,871
Sorry, but I have
a student council meeting today.

461
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,248
We have plenty of time. We can wait.

462
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,958
Just be there before midnight.

463
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,585
I can’t keep you waiting like that.

464
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,379
-Of course, you can.
-We’re good at waiting.

465
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,842
Could you step aside?
She can’t get through.

466
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,223
-Go ahead.
-She stinks the entire hallway

467
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,557
whenever she walks by.

468
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,769
-What?
-Stop it.

469
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,896
It’s nothing.

470
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,901
I’m going to quit school
so find me a place to stay.

471
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,153
Right away, boss?

472
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,366
I figured out what happened,
so I don't have any reason to be here.

473
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,910
And the boy’s father is a bit too much.

474
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,954
You should stay there a little longer.

475
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,374
You should enjoy youth
and the school meals, too.

476
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,751
What the hell?

477
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,007
Hey, kiddo!

478
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,554
Take this.

479
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,769
Do you blame me or something?

480
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,190
I told you not to get involved.

481
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,150
You didn't need to butt in.

482
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,821
I’m sorry
but I don’t remember it too well.

483
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,699
Hyun-jung!

484
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,914
Where did you go
after skipping class yesterday?

485
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,626
You didn’t even come by to eat.

486
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,256
I don't want to be caught eating at a bar.

487
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,051
You can come eat before
the customers come in.

488
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,761
HYUN-JUNG'S TENT BAR

489
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,806
Mi-sun?

490
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,058
Wait, are you Dong-hyun?

491
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,686
Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.

492
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,771
Why don't you come over more often?

493
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,815
You've become more handsome.

494
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,693
He injured his head recently
and lost his memory.

495
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,153
You should get going.

496
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,696
Come over for a meal.

497
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,241
Mi-sun, what are you doing here?

498
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,910
Have you...

499
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,914
lost your manners?

500
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,792
How dare you call an adult
by their first name?

501
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,129
He injured his head, he’s not himself!

502
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,506
That has nothing to do with manners!

503
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,845
You little brat!
How dare you call me by my first name?

504
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,097
Run! Scram!

505
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,321
Mi-sun...

506
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,991
is Hyun-jung’s mom?

507
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,203
SPECIAL: MACKEREL RAMEN

508
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,840
You are just asking
for a beating, aren't you?

509
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,179
You have a foul mouth
for a future newscaster, don't you?

510
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,459
Hey, there’s...

511
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,713
-something in your hair.
-Ouch!

512
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,715
What are you doing?

513
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,179
Dong-hyun grabbed Hyun-jung’s hair.

514
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,389
I’m sorry.

515
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,607
Is there a feud between the class losers?

516
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,359
PATERNITY TEST RESULTS

517
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,031
99.999% POSITIVE

518
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,749
It’s too dangerous!

519
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,222
She’s my daughter?

520
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,184
Hyun-jung?

521
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:23,022
According to science, it's 99.9% positive.

522
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,775
She is definitely your daughter.

523
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,699
It may not be the right time,

524
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,827
but would it be okay
if I congratulated you?

525
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,794
Looks like our caramel macchiato
and mango-banana frappuccino are ready.

526
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,302
Damn it.

527
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,307
Is something wrong?

528
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,476
-Shit!
-What is it?

529
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,477
Where is it?

530
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,896
Hey, Oh Hyun-jung!

531
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,194
Hey!

532
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,282
Did you steal my lip stain?

533
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,660
It wasn’t me.

534
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,372
I left it in my locker earlier.

535
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,001
You were the only one left
in the classroom during gym class.

536
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,298
No use looking for it now, Yun-ji.

537
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,800
Anything she touches rots.

538
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
-I stole it!
-What?

539
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,562
I’ve always wanted one, so I took it.

540
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,399
You stole it?

541
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,192
He really did go crazy.

542
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,860
Then show me.

543
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,612
I tried it on and tossed it away.

544
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,448
It wasn’t really my color.

545
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,412
This idiot...

546
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,248
is a pervert.

547
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,959
What’s going on? Back to your seats.

548
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,091
Turn to page 206.

549
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,304
"Invasion of Japan and
the Deployment of National Defenses."

550
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,390
Japan had won the First Sino-Japanese War.

551
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,068
Four targets.

552
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,404
Break each of their limbs.

553
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,448
Show no mercy.

554
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,287
But boss...

555
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,373
I don’t think this is right.

556
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,168
Minors aren’t my field of expertise.

557
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,630
So, you refuse to do it?

558
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:57,760
I think you should consult
with her directly.

559
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,158
My daughter is being picked on?

560
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,951
Because of me?

561
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,704
Not just because of you.

562
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:30,334
There's her grades and other things, too.
It's complicated.

563
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,921
I should call her teacher--

564
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:38,175
From the looks of things,
teachers seemed to be ignoring it

565
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,386
to avoid any problems.

566
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,680
Then...

567
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,849
what am I supposed to do?

568
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,729
I came here to ask if you had any ideas.

569
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,569
Gosh.

570
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,032
It’s all my fault.

571
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,120
I shouldn’t have raised her
as a single mother.

572
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,873
Jang Pan-su, that bastard!

573
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,210
That bastard.

574
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,129
I hope he rots in hell.

575
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,090
He probably has no idea

576
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,801
what his daughter is going through.

577
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,428
He's a piece of trash.

578
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,932
Well, then.

579
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,852
I'll just try to deal with it myself.

580
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,186
You?

581
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,857
I'll try to engage in an open conversation
with the kids at school.

582
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,776
Perhaps that will help.

583
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:47,911
Are you telling me that
Pan-su embezzled three billion won?

584
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,336
See for yourself, Dad.

585
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:10,225
TRANSACTION RECORD
TOTAL: 3,035,000,000 WON

586
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,818
Hey.

587
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,657
What can I do...

588
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,995
to become close with my daughter?

589
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,626
I’m still single.

590
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,294
Right.

591
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:43,342
I think physical affection
could be the best solution.

592
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:48,639
It would be good to do something
that would make the mind and body strong.

593
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,641
Is that so?

594
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,021
By the way, boss.

595
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,442
You should work on your appearance a bit.

596
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,779
Before you return to your body,

597
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:08,700
you could die from diabetes
and high blood pressure.

598
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,927
Doors closing.

599
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:37,980
It was you?

600
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,441
You told my mom to send me here?

601
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,152
What do you mean?

602
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,072
I just came here to lose weight.

603
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,660
I can’t do this with you here.

604
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,203
I’m going to leave.

605
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,998
Says who?

606
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:04,172
I am your trainer, Master Bang Man-cheol.

607
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,593
Could I...

608
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,761
just get a refund?

609
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,305
Shut your mouth, girl!

610
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:16,101
There are no refunds,
no absence and no mercy at this gym!

611
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,739
You won’t get away with this.

612
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,115
I sure will.

613
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,225
Keep your eyes wide open.

614
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:58,852
That's not it!

615
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,228
Look.

616
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,148
Your waist! Use your waist!

617
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,983
Shut up and go away.

618
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,410
Do it right!

619
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,456
Come in. Good!

620
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,166
Keep going!

621
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,545
Are you okay?

622
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,599
KIM DONG-HYUN

623
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,607
Is that really Dong-hyun?

624
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,484
-It's really him.
-He's so handsome.

625
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,114
Why do you have to eat ramen at my place?

626
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,492
I’m starving to death, okay?

627
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,911
Wait here for a bit.

628
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,204
Sure.

629
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:14,339
MY CHILD CAN BE HAPPY WITHOUT A DAD

630
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,764
WOULD WE BE HAPPY
IF HE WERE HERE...?

631
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:42,367
We’re having steak tonight.
I'll be home soon, my son!

632
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,535
Jong-gi!

633
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,245
Did you make some money?

634
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,256
Don’t hit his face.

635
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,684
-What’s that?
-Please, give me a little more time.

636
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,769
But we don't have any time to spare.

637
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,316
Hey, muscle heads!

638
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,318
Muscle heads?

639
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,945
Aren't you a brave little kid?

640
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,906
Who are you?

641
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,157
And you?

642
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,076
Hey, kid.

643
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,163
This man's got a loan
he needs to pay back.

644
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,372
Why don't you go on home?

645
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:34,544
What is this, the eighties?
This is so old-fashioned.

646
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,589
Dong-hyun. Go home, okay?

647
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:38,632
He's your son?

648
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,467
Hey. Come here.

649
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,094
-You come here.
-"You come here"?

650
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,056
Dong-hyun, listen to me!

651
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,182
Go home!

652
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,101
How did you raise him? He has no manners.

653
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,062
You're the one with no manners.

654
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,397
I’ve had it with this prick.

655
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,899
Damn kid!

656
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,444
Why, you little...

657
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,697
Dong-hyun! No! Please!

658
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,200
Dong-hyun, no! Please don't!

659
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,576
Get the kid.

660
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,702
Get off me!

661
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,663
Kick that little shit!

662
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,958
That’s enough! Stop!

663
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,460
What a tenacious little prick.

664
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,256
I’m going to give you exactly one week.

665
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,800
Call me when you have my 80 million won.
Got it?

666
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,761
EVERGREEN FINANCE

667
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,850
You can get off me now.

668
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,144
They’re gone.

669
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,773
Mister, can you hear me?

670
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,483
Hey.

671
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,117
Hey. Mr. Kim.

672
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,202
Wake up!

673
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,171
Who are you?

674
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,215
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-What?

675
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:03,883
Close your eyes.

676
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,345
What’s with the commotion?

677
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,473
Which one of you is Choe Dong-gu?

678
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,641
Hand up.

679
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,769
That’d be me, who the hell are you?

680
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,496
Hand.

681
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:19,459
You have a client named Kim Jong-gi.

682
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,377
Yes.

683
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,339
Let’s lighten his debt a bit.

684
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,052
It’s not a small amount,
we can’t just erase it.

685
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,846
Have you never used a White-Out in school?

686
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,476
If he owes you eighty million
including interest after two years,

687
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,937
he must have borrowed
about five million to begin with, right?

688
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,023
Yes, you are indeed correct.

689
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,401
But still, that's...

690
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,445
I take it you've heard of Mr. Jang Pan-su
of Hanho Partners?

691
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,365
Of course, I have.

692
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,784
But what about him?

693
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,371
Kim Jong-gi is his father.

694
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,373
I see!

695
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,834
What?

696
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,257
It’s okay.

697
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,260
Just accept it as it is.

698
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,553
But that doesn’t...

699
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:20,603
What’s this? This is amazing!

700
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,771
Incredible!

701
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,244
How are you feeling?

702
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,125
Your father passed out
while being beaten up.

703
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,794
Couldn't you have at least
taken me to the hospital?

704
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,632
I got a call from the loan sharks.

705
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,344
They told me to forget the interest
and just pay back the principal.

706
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:59,058
Looks like my defensive strategy worked.

707
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,145
So what?

708
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,399
Hey, son!

709
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,446
Don’t lose too much weight.

710
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,325
You’re handsome just as you are.

711
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:20,997
This is hot!

712
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:22,832
Hot!

713
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,417
So hot!

714
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,212
The teacher's coming.

715
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,896
-Damn it.
-Sorry.

716
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,190
Screw that. My lunch is all rotten now.

717
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,650
My gosh.

718
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,443
Now it reeks of Hyun-jung.

719
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,487
Want a new plate?

720
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,072
Forget it.

721
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,573
What if it’s not rotten?

722
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,783
What?

723
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,785
Do you want to bet 100,000 won?

724
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,954
Here, you try it first.

725
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,127
What did you just say, you loser?

726
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:12,840
Are you nuts?

727
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,811
Stop trying to act tough, you loser.

728
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,855
Do you really want to mess up
your school life that bad?

729
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:31,276
It doesn’t matter.
It’s messy enough already.

730
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,320
But I’d like to change that.

731
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,659
Damn it!

732
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,209
Dig in.

733
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,753
I’m treating you for helping Hyun-jung
at school.

734
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:51,796
This is...

735
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,550
It’s mackerel ramen. I hope you like it.

736
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:12,900
I used to have this a lot with someone.

737
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,656
It’s great. You should put this
on the menu.

738
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:20,992
No way.

739
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,703
It reminds me of him.

740
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,538
"Him"?

741
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,957
Hyun-jung’s dad.

742
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,048
Did things end badly with him?

743
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:43,723
I still have regrets
when I think about him.

744
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:51,814
What regrets?

745
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,943
I regret not having  killed him.

746
01:00:58,863 --> 01:00:59,697
I’m sorry.

747
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,790
Actually, you remind me
of him quite a bit.

748
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,379
He used to wipe everything down.

749
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,637
I’ll pack you a few dishes
so you can have them with your dad.

750
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,306
Yes. Thank you.

751
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,686
Ma’am!

752
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,105
-A bottle of soju, please.
-Sure thing.

753
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,107
Where have you been?

754
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,650
I had a guest.

755
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,612
I was saying...

756
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,864
Here you go.

757
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:43,741
Hey!

758
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,535
You still have a firm ass!

759
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,204
What was that?

760
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,582
Ma’am, is this your son?

761
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:56,671
Your mom is pretty, so I touched her.

762
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,507
Do you have a death wish?

763
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:04,053
How dare you bark at a paying customer!

764
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,763
Don’t you want to make money?

765
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,307
Don’t yell at the boy!

766
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,684
You bitch!

767
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,395
Let him go!

768
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,479
Dong-hyun.

769
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,314
Go inside. I’ll take care of this.

770
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,399
You go home, all right?

771
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,360
You two are so sweet, aren't you?

772
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,989
Mi-sun, are you okay?

773
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,409
Get in the kitchen. Now.

774
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,827
-You...
-Listen to me.

775
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,249
You little prick.

776
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,210
Why don't you just head home quietly
if you've had enough to drink?

777
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,754
You worthless good-for-nothing.

778
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,466
Look at this punk.

779
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,427
You prick!

780
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,517
You grabbed my woman’s hair?

781
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:54,771
Who are you?

782
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,939
Are you sleeping with her?

783
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,200
Stop it, please!

784
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,828
You’ll kill him!

785
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:16,417
Who are you?

786
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,005
Who on earth are you?

787
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,386
Why do you keep calling me Mi-sun?

788
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,688
You expect me to believe that?

789
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,692
You switched bodies
because of an accident?

790
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,989
Yes, I have to admit

791
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:53,371
that the way you talk and act
remind me of someone.

792
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,582
But that doesn’t mean you’re Jang Pan-su.

793
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,545
You have a small peach-shaped
mole next to your belly button.

794
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,338
What?

795
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:06,384
Do you want me to go into
even more intimate details?

796
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,429
Wait.

797
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:17,395
At which restaurant did we first meet?

798
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,146
Arpeggio in Yeonnam-dong.

799
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,608
You ordered a caffe latte
and I ordered a Bud.

800
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,194
Where did we break up?

801
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,696
The cafe in Sinsa Hotel.

802
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:31,325
You came to see me for the last time,
and you ordered a lemon tea.

803
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:33,744
Are you...

804
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,206
really Jang Pan-su?

805
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,542
Yes.

806
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:46,507
Why didn’t you tell me you were pregnant?

807
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,637
-I'm sorry but she’s not your child.
-I already did a paternity test.

808
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,018
That’s exactly what Pan-su would do.

809
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,480
It's my turn to ask now.

810
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,400
Why did you show up here out of the blue?

811
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,527
Our relationship ended years ago.

812
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,865
Did you think you could move me
by kicking out a few drunks?

813
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,742
No matter what, you're still...

814
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,411
a gangster.

815
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,290
And let's get this straight.

816
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,670
I did not raise your child.
I raised my own kid.

817
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,507
You don’t deserve to be a father.

818
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,553
Leave.

819
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,931
-Mi-sun, listen--
-Get out!

820
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,684
Should I call the police?

821
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,123
You never answered my calls.

822
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,795
You even moved.

823
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,172
You said you couldn’t live
with a criminal.

824
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,465
Of course!

825
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,593
What kind of woman
wants her man to be a criminal?

826
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:13,844
That’s why.

827
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,139
I told you that we weren't meant to be.

828
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:26,565
I’m getting married next month,
to my boss's daughter.

829
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:30,152
What?

830
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,154
Leave memories in the past.

831
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,116
No need to get pathetic and worked up.

832
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,909
Pan-su.

833
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,495
I’m leaving.

834
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:04,270
Did you say something
to offend my mom again?

835
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,689
She told me to stay away from you.

836
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:16,032
I've made some mistakes.

837
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:18,284
I've let your mother down.

838
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,123
You called her
by her first name again, didn't you?

839
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,295
You’re Oh Hyun-jung, right?

840
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,465
Well, yes.

841
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:36,552
Do you want to come to my birthday party
at my family villa this weekend?

842
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,891
I wanted to throw a big party with friends
before we became seniors.

843
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,477
I can come?

844
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,771
Of course!

845
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,191
I’ll take that as a yes
and call you later.

846
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:54,653
Let’s go.

847
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,324
Is that someone you like?

848
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,494
No way.

849
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,749
He must be, you're blushing.

850
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,334
No way!

851
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,548
I’m off.

852
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,250
PLEASE, SEE ME
I'M BEGGING YOU

853
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,987
-You came.
-Well, happy birthday.

854
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,280
Thank you.

855
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:20,906
Shall we?

856
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,327
Hey, hi.

857
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,831
-Bring us some when they're done.
-Sure. Wait inside.

858
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,501
When is he going to get here?

859
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,004
What took you so long?

860
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,467
You promised me
I would get weekends off.

861
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,427
Hey.

862
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,596
Whine again and I’ll call Cheol-ho.

863
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,306
Leave that here and piss off.

864
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,975
Hyun-jung must be so excited right now.

865
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,935
She will be happy that she's been invited.

866
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,230
She’s so clueless, that stupid bitch.

867
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,065
She deserves it.

868
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,492
You came.

869
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:16,503
What would you like?

870
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:18,839
Anything.

871
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:22,927
She'll have a caffe latte
and I'll have a bottle of Bud.

872
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,679
May I see your ID?

873
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:32,019
I’ll take the Bud
and he'll have a glass of orange juice.

874
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:33,354
Sure.

875
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,816
Why did you want to see me?

876
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,110
Well...

877
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,614
I understand that no matter what I say,

878
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,116
it's difficult for you to forgive me.

879
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,744
But...

880
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:51,830
I want you to know

881
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,125
that I sincerely regret
what I did...

882
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:58,045
and that I'm sorry
for what happened between us.

883
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,385
If it wasn’t for this...

884
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,515
If this unbelievable thing
hadn't happened,

885
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,809
would you still have apologized?

886
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,728
Would you have even looked for me?

887
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,440
You were fine without me until now.

888
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,611
I thought I was...

889
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:28,617
just someone in your past
that you wanted to forget about.

890
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,077
Mi-sun.

891
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,954
How is this going to change anything?

892
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,539
You’re a married man!

893
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,125
He looks so young though.

894
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,460
I just...

895
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,131
Don’t make me feel even more miserable.

896
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,273
Mi-sun, I was--

897
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,607
You bastard!

898
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,871
Mi-sun, please. Listen to me.

899
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,998
Just once. Please?

900
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,711
I’m sorry, I really am.

901
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,381
How dare you kiss me?

902
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,719
Do I look that easy to you?

903
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,723
I'm so mad right now.

904
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,643
Come. Let’s go to the police.

905
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:38,896
Wait. There's no need for that.

906
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,399
KIM JAE-IK

907
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:44,610
What is it?

908
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,278
I just heard something fishy.

909
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:48,822
Hyun-jung may be in trouble.

910
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:49,990
Where?

911
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:56,330
We’ll have to go to the station later.

912
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,624
I've got an urgent matter.

913
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,042
Hey!

914
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:02,044
Man-cheol?

915
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,796
Get me a car as soon as possible.

916
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:11,595
Dong-hyun, I don't think
we should be driving as minors.

917
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,640
Shut up and give me the directions.

918
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,351
Is this the right way?

919
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,105
Damn it. This is the way...

920
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,316
but Cheol-ho will kill me.

921
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,694
You'll be better off with him than me.

922
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,827
-Are you okay?
-Don’t!

923
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,835
Drink up!

924
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,881
Quiet down.

925
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,299
Here.

926
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:50,717
Drink.

927
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:51,802
Bottoms up.

928
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,597
No, thanks, I don’t drink.

929
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,976
You can’t back out now.

930
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,062
Everyone’s watching, save me some face.

931
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:06,483
What's that got to do with me drinking?

932
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:11,864
We put on this party for you,
so don’t disappoint us.

933
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,033
Just go with the flow, okay?

934
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,371
What do you mean?

935
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:28,422
God damn it.

936
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,097
Listen.

937
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,267
Why would anyone invite a loser like you?

938
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:44,480
Cheol-ho recommended someone
who wouldn’t cause any problems.

939
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:45,606
You piece of trash.

940
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,484
-Who do you think you are?
-You bitch.

941
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,322
Don’t you know who his father is?

942
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:54,990
Forget it.

943
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:19,598
Can I help you?

944
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,266
This is a members only--

945
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:26,688
Did you see that?

946
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,662
Listen to me.

947
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,750
What the hell?

948
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,919
-Dong-hyun!
-Who's this?

949
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:57,636
Who are you?

950
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,971
And you?

951
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,890
We were just having some fun, weren't we?

952
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,228
Let’s go. You shouldn't be here.

953
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,021
Where do you think you're going?

954
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,441
The party's just getting started,
she can’t leave now.

955
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:13,277
Boys.

956
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,903
Dong-hyun!

957
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,530
Just stand back and watch.

958
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,198
Bunch of little brats.

959
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,158
Did you lose your brain as well

960
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:22,411
after bumping your head?

961
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:24,121
Guys.

962
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,831
Get him.

963
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,284
He’s a damn maniac!

964
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,087
How was it?
My punch is a little better, huh?

965
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,340
How cute.

966
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:19,384
You.

967
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:21,720
Try me.

968
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,728
Cheol-ho! Get it together!

969
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,814
I’m fine, I just slipped.

970
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:39,613
Oh, no!

971
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:42,699
He’s so cool.

972
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,543
Son of a bitch!

973
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:11,353
Take better care of yourself.

974
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,318
Let me go, you bastard!

975
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,904
Do you want to die?

976
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,323
What? Are you going to hit me?

977
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,117
Try me, asshole.

978
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,993
You crazy bitch.

979
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:38,463
Help me!

980
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,758
I can’t swim! Help!

981
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:45,679
Are you okay?

982
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:47,472
Yeah.

983
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:51,059
Well done. Let’s get out of here.

984
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,397
THE PYEONAHN HOSPITAL

985
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:03,822
What’s this?

986
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,992
By the chairman’s order,
no one is allowed inside.

987
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:24,176
Everyone thinks that
you got into an accident

988
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,470
while trying to embezzle
three billion won.

989
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:31,349
Your wife is siding with Mr. Yang.

990
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,819
What should I do?

991
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:21,066
Hyun-jung told me everything.
How are you feeling?

992
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,485
I'm fine.

993
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,488
How is Hyun-jung?

994
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,616
If you’re so worried about her,
please leave...

995
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:31,952
Forever.

996
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:33,787
Mi-sun.

997
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:36,122
What exactly can you do
for her in that body?

998
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,750
What if she figures it out?

999
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:42,838
All right.

1000
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:45,882
I’ll do that.

1001
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,481
What do you want?

1002
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:03,733
Did you come to see Hyun-jung?

1003
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,903
Why? Are you here to get her back?

1004
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,197
No, it’s not like that.

1005
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:14,494
I just wanted to apologize to you both.

1006
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:21,459
Are you going out with her by any chance?

1007
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:22,586
Are you nuts?

1008
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,339
We’re not like that.

1009
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:29,885
In that case...

1010
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,138
what about me?

1011
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,392
Are you asking me to date
a high school chick?

1012
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,937
You’re in high school too.

1013
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:43,982
My answer is no.

1014
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:45,400
Go home and study.

1015
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:49,279
Here.

1016
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:54,784
Bye.

1017
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,329
What's got into her?

1018
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,459
DONG-HYUN, I LIKE YOU
FROM YOON-JI

1019
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:06,212
What are you doing here?

1020
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,759
What were you talking to Yoon-ji about?

1021
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:13,887
It was nothing.

1022
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:16,473
Did she ask you out?

1023
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:21,436
-It’s nothing like that.
-Are you going to go out with her?

1024
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:26,024
I don’t want to go to jail in my forties.

1025
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,860
Who's in their forties?

1026
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:33,949
Forget it. I won’t ever date her.

1027
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,076
-Then go out with me.
-Hey!

1028
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,328
Didn’t you like me all along?

1029
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,914
Why were you so nice to me--

1030
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:43,667
I’m asking you out.

1031
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,086
I want your answer before the weekend.

1032
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,677
You asked who out now?

1033
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:55,679
Dong-hyun.

1034
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,390
I thought you liked him.

1035
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:02,310
Are you insane?

1036
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:05,855
No! Never! Not in a million years!

1037
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,692
He’s a weirdo, don’t even think about it!

1038
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,653
I told you he saved me at the party.

1039
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,154
He risked his life to rescue me.

1040
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:15,740
Hyun-jung.

1041
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,410
Baby, please.

1042
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:21,162
Listen to me, this is all wrong.

1043
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,540
Tell me why I can’t.

1044
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,376
He takes care of me like a real father.

1045
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,712
That’s exactly why!

1046
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,588
I grew up without a dad.

1047
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:34,050
I can’t even get to have a boyfriend
who’s like a dad?

1048
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,152
Will you just listen to me?

1049
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,744
What exactly did you do
to make her ask you out?

1050
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,998
It’s a misunderstanding,
I only wanted to be nice to her.

1051
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,002
Does it feel good to ruin
our lives completely?

1052
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,795
Mi-sun.

1053
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:16,009
Leave at once, and don’t ever come back.

1054
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,764
If you ever show up around Hyun-jung,

1055
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,558
I'll kill you, then I'll kill myself.

1056
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:28,855
What do I have to do
to have you forgive me?

1057
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,489
If there was a way, I would have already.

1058
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,576
Even if I did forgive you,

1059
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,205
you're a married man. Did you forget?

1060
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:49,667
Married?

1061
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,962
What do you mean?

1062
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:55,757
Hyun-jung.

1063
01:24:56,424 --> 01:25:00,345
What did you mean?
About forgiving and marriage.

1064
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,139
Why are you two talking about such things?

1065
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:06,976
Hyun-jung.

1066
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,437
I’m sorry.

1067
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:14,901
I love Mi-sun, I mean...

1068
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:19,697
I love your mom.

1069
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:21,241
What?

1070
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,788
That’s not it, Hyun-jung.

1071
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:28,289
Listen to me.

1072
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:31,334
Is this why you were mad
when I said I asked him out?

1073
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:32,961
Hyun-jung.

1074
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:35,922
It's disgusting.

1075
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:37,882
Hyun-jung.

1076
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:39,551
Hyun-jung!

1077
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,098
Jang Pan-su.

1078
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:47,642
Why did you say that?

1079
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,812
What’s done is done,

1080
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:54,274
and this is much better
than dating my own daughter.

1081
01:25:55,066 --> 01:25:55,900
What?

1082
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:58,361
You crazy bastard!

1083
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,489
How could you even say that, you bastard?

1084
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,533
Are you out of your god damn mind?

1085
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:05,910
Can I help you?

1086
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:07,787
What the hell?

1087
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,423
Jang Pan-su.

1088
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,511
It’s a good day to die, isn't it?

1089
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,892
Look at him, he's grown a beard.

1090
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:33,062
You should’ve led a good life.

1091
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:38,401
Because you lived a fucked-up life,
you've fucked yourself up in the end.

1092
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,236
Pan-su.

1093
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,449
Don’t blame me for this.

1094
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:50,830
Seeing how we only live once...
I’ll give you a comfortable farewell.

1095
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,169
Mister, your zipper’s down.

1096
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:57,337
What?

1097
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,676
What? Pan-su!

1098
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:17,815
There.

1099
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,032
Dong-hyun?

1100
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,661
You've come at the right time.
I made you a special...

1101
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,163
Dad.

1102
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:37,460
I became a strange man. What do I do, Dad?

1103
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,673
Don’t call me Dad! Who are you?

1104
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:45,260
I’m your son, Dong-hyun! Kim Dong-hyun!

1105
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:49,889
You must have the wrong house.

1106
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:53,309
This isn’t your home.

1107
01:27:56,729 --> 01:27:58,147
Wait, you are...

1108
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,316
Mr. Jang?

1109
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:02,068
I’m Dong-hyun!

1110
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:05,071
I have no memories
since I fell off that roof!

1111
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,031
What do I do, Dad?

1112
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,075
-Stay back! Please!
-Dad!

1113
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:10,410
Don’t come near me!

1114
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,661
Dad!

1115
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,664
-What is it?
-Dad!

1116
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,791
Get out of here!

1117
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,880
What in the world? How did you wake up?

1118
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,926
You look like someone.

1119
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,806
Wait. Are you me?

1120
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:37,270
But I lost so much weight.

1121
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,230
Damn it. Yes, I'm you.

1122
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:40,982
Well...

1123
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:43,526
is my body all right?

1124
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,820
Dad! Thief!

1125
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,280
He stole my body!

1126
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:49,574
Call the police!

1127
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:51,367
Jeez.

1128
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,493
Why did you...

1129
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,080
He was injured because of you.
Why did you hit him?

1130
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,207
I’m sorry. My son injured his head.

1131
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:02,003
-Why did you hit me?
-Be quiet and just sit down.

1132
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:03,338
I’ll explain everything.

1133
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,220
That’s impossible.

1134
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:13,514
So, what you’re saying is

1135
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:14,974
that this man is you

1136
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,102
and that you are this man.

1137
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:19,437
Right.

1138
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:22,607
Does that mean I have to live out
the rest of my life as an old man?

1139
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,275
Daddy.

1140
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,319
Yes, sir! Go on.

1141
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:30,156
I don’t know what will happen next.
I'm a victim, too.

1142
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:35,536
You gained 30 years of your life
but I just lost 30 years of my life.

1143
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,288
This is so unfair.

1144
01:29:37,997 --> 01:29:39,123
Unfair?

1145
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,167
Listen, kiddo.

1146
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,920
Who do you think
lost all your weight for you?

1147
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:45,880
-Am I wrong?
-That’s true.

1148
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:48,174
Whose side are you on, Dad?

1149
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:49,092
My apologies, sir.

1150
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:51,636
Stop talking funny. It’s me, Dong-hyun!

1151
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,721
I’ll get used to it eventually.

1152
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:58,684
Wait a minute.

1153
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,773
You expect me to believe all this?

1154
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,818
You two are playing a trick on me,
aren't you?

1155
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,152
Sit back down. I'm not finished.

1156
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:09,445
You little...

1157
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:12,448
-Dad, sit.
-Yes, sir.

1158
01:30:19,288 --> 01:30:22,959
When I had measles at six,

1159
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:26,712
we were both hospitalized
because you crashed your bicycle.

1160
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:34,303
I got a glass shard stuck in my throat
when I was in third grade

1161
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:37,098
and you pulled it out and saved my life.

1162
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,810
I remember, sir.

1163
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:47,024
I’m your son, Dong-hyun.
You named me yourself.

1164
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,071
-Are you
-Dad.

1165
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,283
-really my son, sir?
-Dad.

1166
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,994
How in the world did this happen?

1167
01:30:58,077 --> 01:30:59,287
Dad.

1168
01:31:01,414 --> 01:31:05,126
You smoke, right? I have so much mucus!

1169
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,378
You have a wart on your ass.

1170
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,505
It hurts whenever I sit.

1171
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,009
Anyhow...

1172
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:16,262
I need you to help me.

1173
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,306
What now?

1174
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:21,476
You like Hyun-jung, right?

1175
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:25,771
If you help me out...

1176
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:28,191
I'll help you date her.

1177
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:31,903
When I woke up, he was already gone.

1178
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:34,655
How could you screw up like that?
You said you’d take care of it!

1179
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:35,740
Hey!

1180
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,618
Do I look like your husband to you?

1181
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,244
Watch your mouth.

1182
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,622
If he goes to see Dad...

1183
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:47,084
I have my men searching for him,
so go get the money like I told you to!

1184
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,006
I shouldn’t have listened
to that greedy pig.

1185
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:53,424
How dare she?

1186
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:54,383
Got it.

1187
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,346
They've found a cab driver
who has just driven Mr. Jang.

1188
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:13,611
Mi-sun.

1189
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:29,293
What’s happened?

1190
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,090
When he woke up,

1191
01:32:35,466 --> 01:32:38,261
we returned to our own bodies.

1192
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,139
I’m Dong-hyun now...

1193
01:32:43,849 --> 01:32:46,352
and this man is the real Pan-su.

1194
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,190
Your bodies swapped back?

1195
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:56,279
This man, I mean... The kid is right.

1196
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:08,291
I’m really sorry.

1197
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:13,504
I want to apologize with all my heart.

1198
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:18,426
I’ve never, once in my life...

1199
01:33:19,969 --> 01:33:21,470
forgotten about you.

1200
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,556
What are you...

1201
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,854
I've been looking all over the place.

1202
01:33:37,194 --> 01:33:38,029
Who are you?

1203
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:40,197
Jang Pan-su.

1204
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:44,368
You've bitten off more than you can chew.

1205
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:49,498
Tie them up together
and toss them in the ocean.

1206
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:50,416
Yes, boss.

1207
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,044
Excuse me. One moment, please.

1208
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,420
What is it?

1209
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:58,424
Do you have any last words?

1210
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:02,303
Don’t kill us.

1211
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:07,433
I just woke up, I can’t die like this.

1212
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:11,520
Who are you people anyway?

1213
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:17,860
He must have a screw loose
from being hospitalized for too long.

1214
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,159
-You two get in the kitchen.
-Yes.

1215
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,620
What’s this?

1216
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,164
What are you going to do by yourself?

1217
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,417
Hold on!

1218
01:34:36,712 --> 01:34:38,047
Make sure she doesn’t get out.

1219
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:40,299
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

1220
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:43,010
Ma’am, stay here. They are really scary.

1221
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,679
I'm scared, too. This way.

1222
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:48,974
What a load of shit.

1223
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:51,936
Boys.

1224
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:53,562
Bring them out.

1225
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:16,043
Who is this punk?

1226
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,170
You still talk too much, Mr. Yang.

1227
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:20,423
Mr. Yang?

1228
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,595
How dare you talk like that to an adult.

1229
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,432
You should watch your mouth, you prick.

1230
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:32,017
-So what?
-"So what?"

1231
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,020
I've heard that somewhere.

1232
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,815
Who the hell are you?

1233
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,235
I'm obviously a high school student.

1234
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,112
Got a problem?

1235
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:44,989
High school?

1236
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,409
Which grade and class?

1237
01:35:50,286 --> 01:35:53,080
Enough with the census. Come at me.

1238
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:59,044
There isn't much time
before the bar opens for business.

1239
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:02,631
He's driving me nuts.

1240
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:07,344
What are you standing around for?
Take care of this brat.

1241
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:09,555
Hey, Mr. Jo!

1242
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:13,058
Where’s Mr. Jo?

1243
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,603
Is he sleeping?

1244
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,206
Hey, Mr. Gwak.

1245
01:36:52,389 --> 01:36:53,641
Not bad.

1246
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:02,942
Take off your tie, asshole.

1247
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:02,960
-Boys.
-Yes, sir!

1248
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:13,220
Ma’am, don’t! Please, stay put.

1249
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:35,868
Let’s wrap this up.

1250
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:46,295
Didn't I tell you to take off your tie?

1251
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:48,047
What?

1252
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:02,603
Hey.

1253
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:03,938
You.

1254
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:06,732
Hey!

1255
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:14,615
Watch this, Pan-su!

1256
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:18,911
I shouldn’t be killing minors, damn it.

1257
01:39:19,203 --> 01:39:20,037
Stop!

1258
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,833
Don’t hurt him!

1259
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:28,712
Shit.

1260
01:39:30,214 --> 01:39:33,092
He’s the father of my child.

1261
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,426
He's your child?

1262
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:36,220
He's the father of my child!

1263
01:39:37,596 --> 01:39:39,640
If you touch him...

1264
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:42,893
we all die together.

1265
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:44,937
Shit.

1266
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:47,439
I’m going to count to five.

1267
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,275
If you don’t leave by then,

1268
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,736
we die together.

1269
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:56,782
You better start running
if you want to live.

1270
01:39:57,449 --> 01:39:58,701
Hey, lady!

1271
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:02,371
If you light that, you die too.

1272
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:04,790
Do I look like I’m afraid to die?

1273
01:40:05,207 --> 01:40:07,918
This asshole destroyed my life.

1274
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:10,713
Even now, I’m just hanging on by a thread.

1275
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,717
Why? You don't believe me?

1276
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:19,013
Did you think I was fine without you?

1277
01:40:21,348 --> 01:40:23,350
Why do you think I had Hyun-jung?

1278
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:25,769
God damn it.

1279
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:29,356
I wanted to at least have a child
who resembled you!

1280
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:36,071
I gave you a chance,
but you still left me.

1281
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:37,823
What is she saying?

1282
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:43,162
Did you think a word of apology
would change all that after all this time?

1283
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:45,497
She’s completely crazy.

1284
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,958
Did she just say that
she had this kid’s child?

1285
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,793
If you want to live...

1286
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:52,379
get out of my bar.

1287
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:54,757
One!

1288
01:40:54,923 --> 01:40:56,592
Wait!

1289
01:41:01,972 --> 01:41:03,849
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

1290
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:06,268
You’re no different!

1291
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:08,312
Two!

1292
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:11,440
Three!

1293
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:12,941
We better leave, boss!

1294
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:15,736
But Jang Pan-su is still in there!

1295
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:16,737
Four!

1296
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,990
No!

1297
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:50,687
Mi-sun.

1298
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:55,901
Are you okay?

1299
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,823
Ma’am, I smell gas in here.

1300
01:42:01,156 --> 01:42:02,241
I feel dizzy.

1301
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:05,744
Stay back.

1302
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:12,584
I have something to say to him.

1303
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:18,549
-Mi-sun.
-I know!

1304
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:23,679
But...

1305
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,975
the man I used to love

1306
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:32,604
is that Jang Pan-su over there.
So please...

1307
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,759
I’ve waited so long.

1308
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:06,513
Jang Pan-su.

1309
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:12,352
Watching Hyun-jung grow to resemble you
more and more each day...

1310
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:16,690
I missed you so much...

1311
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,528
every time I saw her face.

1312
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:26,533
You can’t even imagine how much.

1313
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,954
One year turned into ten...

1314
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:36,168
And finally, after 17 years

1315
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,923
we see each other again.

1316
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,054
I've aged a lot, haven't I?

1317
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:53,018
Thank you.

1318
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:05,155
Yes.

1319
01:44:08,283 --> 01:44:09,826
This is the face.

1320
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,281
Did you want to see me, Dad?

1321
01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:50,784
Do you know what I detest the most?

1322
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,161
What?

1323
01:44:57,332 --> 01:44:59,626
Someone who holds a knife
against their own family.

1324
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,640
Dear Chairman Han, my dear father-in-law.

1325
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:18,770
If you’re reading this,
I have already fallen victim

1326
01:45:19,604 --> 01:45:22,190
to their conspiracy
and have been labeled a traitor.

1327
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:25,360
In that letter,

1328
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:29,239
he says that you've plotted
this conspiracy

1329
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:31,450
together with Mr. Yang.

1330
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,493
This is nonsense, Dad.

1331
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:37,664
How could someone in a coma
write this letter?

1332
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:40,208
His handwriting has already been verified.

1333
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,462
This doesn't make any sense.

1334
01:45:43,545 --> 01:45:47,591
Mr. Yang approached me after the accident,
so he couldn't...

1335
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:53,680
In other words,

1336
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:59,186
are you admitting that you've
conspired with Mr. Yang?

1337
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:04,649
Come in.

1338
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:25,462
Boss. Is it okay to send him in alone?

1339
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,715
Who would believe me if I went in?

1340
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:32,761
The chairman wants Jang Pan-su.

1341
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:39,893
Don’t say anything else
and stick to my plan.

1342
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,159
I called for him.

1343
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:58,328
Have a seat.

1344
01:47:01,873 --> 01:47:05,919
Jang Pan-su,
what exactly are you planning?

1345
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,337
Shut your mouth!

1346
01:47:12,717 --> 01:47:15,470
What should we do now?

1347
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:19,391
Ask the chairman what he wants.

1348
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:23,353
"Ask the chairman what he wants"!

1349
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:27,607
What did you say?

1350
01:47:28,525 --> 01:47:32,320
Well, I wanted to ask...

1351
01:47:34,072 --> 01:47:37,534
what he, I mean,
what you would like to do.

1352
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,297
I pronounce you the heir to Hanho Group!

1353
01:47:52,048 --> 01:47:53,341
Dad!

1354
01:47:54,259 --> 01:47:56,511
I’ll vest your entire fortune,

1355
01:47:56,595 --> 01:48:00,599
including the money you stole,
to the company!

1356
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:05,312
How could you? I’m your daughter!

1357
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:10,108
You won’t get any inheritance from me,
so don’t ever come back!

1358
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,986
What about what he did to me?

1359
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,991
He had an affair behind my back
and he even has a 17-year-old daughter.

1360
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:22,496
You didn't think I would look into it?

1361
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:26,374
You went straight to her bar
after leaving the hospital.

1362
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:28,335
Is this true?

1363
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:32,547
Tell him that it’s a misunderstanding.

1364
01:48:33,798 --> 01:48:36,551
Well, I...

1365
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:40,597
Sir, I can’t hear you.

1366
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:42,891
Hey, Dong-hyun.

1367
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:44,309
Can you hear me?

1368
01:48:45,268 --> 01:48:47,270
Sir, I need your help.

1369
01:48:48,104 --> 01:48:50,190
-I can’t hear you.
-Explain yourself!

1370
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:53,610
Well, that is...

1371
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:57,364
-the truth.
-What?

1372
01:48:57,447 --> 01:49:01,159
But the child wasn’t born
while I was living with this lady.

1373
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:06,498
An ex-girlfriend gave birth without him,
I mean, me, knowing.

1374
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:08,792
Do you even listen to yourself?

1375
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:12,462
Fact is that you have a daughter,
you son of a bitch.

1376
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:15,298
Don’t swear, lady.

1377
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,300
Hyun-jung is a lovely girl.

1378
01:49:17,842 --> 01:49:20,720
Dad, look. He’s completely mad.

1379
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:22,180
How could he say that?

1380
01:49:22,597 --> 01:49:23,848
Stay out of this!

1381
01:49:26,476 --> 01:49:27,727
Continue.

1382
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:32,899
It came to me after the accident.

1383
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:35,277
Should I step in?

1384
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:45,662
What’s more important
than being with the family you love?

1385
01:49:46,246 --> 01:49:50,792
Does that mean that you're going to
give up your right as an heir?

1386
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:58,883
I don’t know how rich you are, but yes.

1387
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:03,263
What did he just say?

1388
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:11,229
It won't be easy giving up.

1389
01:50:14,524 --> 01:50:16,318
Can you promise not to regret it?

1390
01:50:16,484 --> 01:50:19,487
I've lived with too many regrets
until now.

1391
01:50:20,655 --> 01:50:25,327
I’m telling you this now
so that I won’t have any more regrets.

1392
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:27,537
You’re all crazy.

1393
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,544
Goodbye, ma'am.

1394
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:41,051
As the father of a foolish child...

1395
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:47,599
I have no right to stop you.

1396
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:51,353
Do as you wish.

1397
01:50:53,938 --> 01:50:55,940
Thank you. Then I'll...

1398
01:50:56,816 --> 01:50:57,942
Goodbye.

1399
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:10,330
Kim Dong-hyun!

1400
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,103
Thank you.

1401
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:36,398
You’re a better man than I am.

1402
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:39,067
You too, sir.

1403
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:43,113
You fight really well.

1404
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:53,164
Crazy bastards.

1405
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:08,513
Wake up, sir!

1406
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:11,015
Boss.

1407
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:13,476
You have to keep the mask on.

1408
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:20,233
Man-cheol. Look after Hyun-jung for me.

1409
01:52:21,276 --> 01:52:23,695
Yes.

1410
01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:34,956
Wake up, sir. Hyun-jung’s here!

1411
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,083
Dong-hyun!

1412
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:46,384
Excuse me.

1413
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,514
Mom, is he...

1414
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:56,102
my dad?

1415
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:02,567
I saw him in a photo you hid away.

1416
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:05,195
Am I right?

1417
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:08,281
Hyun-jung.

1418
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:14,913
I am your dad.

1419
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:17,999
What?

1420
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:22,921
My daughter, Hyun-jung.

1421
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:27,133
This can't be.

1422
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,303
Did you...

1423
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:34,224
get married already?

1424
01:53:35,642 --> 01:53:36,643
What?

1425
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:43,149
No, I’m really your dad.

1426
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:49,906
Please.

1427
01:53:55,703 --> 01:53:56,538
Forgive me.

1428
01:53:59,374 --> 01:54:04,254
I wasn’t there when you were born.

1429
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:10,051
When you said your first word,
or when you took your first step,

1430
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:14,013
I wasn't there for you.

1431
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:17,684
What are you on about?

1432
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:24,232
My dearest Hyun-jung.

1433
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,529
Don’t ever forget...

1434
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:36,494
that I love you.

1435
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:40,832
Pan-su.

1436
01:54:40,915 --> 01:54:42,041
-Dong-hyun!
-Sir!

1437
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:42,959
Dong-hyun!

1438
01:54:45,753 --> 01:54:47,422
Help! Over here!

1439
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:50,925
-Dong-hyun!
-Boss!

1440
01:54:51,009 --> 01:54:52,302
I mean, boss!

1441
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:10,194
Did you like my gift?

1442
01:55:13,948 --> 01:55:15,241
It’s you!

1443
01:55:15,783 --> 01:55:21,789
You've had a difficult time taking care
of your wife and daughter, didn't you?

1444
01:55:23,291 --> 01:55:25,043
Get some sleep.

1445
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:35,637
SIX MONTHS LATER

1446
01:55:36,679 --> 01:55:39,057
-It’s Dong-hyun!
-Holy cow!

1447
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:40,058
-He’s here!
-Wow!

1448
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:46,272
Kim Dong-hyun!

1449
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:52,695
Kim Dong-hyun!

1450
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:58,952
Thanks to you,
the bullies transferred to another school.

1451
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:30,733
Hey, Dad!

1452
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:38,533
Should we have
some strawberry milk together?

1453
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,284
Hyun-jung.

1454
01:56:50,169 --> 01:56:52,046
-How do you know Mrs. Jang?
-How do you feel now?

1455
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,881
I will fully cooperate
with the investigation

1456
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:57,719
but it's all Jang Pan-su’s fault!

1457
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:01,347
And that punk ass kid!

1458
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:03,224
He got a high schooler to fight!

1459
01:57:05,977 --> 01:57:10,565
And you call yourself a man?
Put more strength into it!

1460
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:12,692
Kids will rush in soon.

1461
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:16,988
-Don't pick on me, what about him?
-Jong-gi is way better than you are.

1462
01:57:17,238 --> 01:57:19,115
I’m getting pretty good, aren't I?

1463
01:57:19,532 --> 01:57:22,952
Come on,
I'm the one who gave you this building.

1464
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:27,290
Do you think I'm the kind of person
who would live off the rent?

1465
01:57:27,373 --> 01:57:29,250
Do you even know the value of labor?

1466
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:32,336
I'm sorry, boss, I mean, landlord.
I’ll do my best.

1467
01:57:34,714 --> 01:57:36,716
-I’m back!
-Come on in.

1468
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:38,551
-Good afternoon!
-Dong-hyun is here, too.

1469
01:57:38,634 --> 01:57:41,846
Go get changed and start cleaning.

1470
01:57:42,597 --> 01:57:43,890
Let me do it, ma’am.

1471
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:47,060
See? He wants to do it.

1472
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:48,728
You can do it together then.

1473
01:57:49,062 --> 01:57:52,023
You have to promise that
you’ll pay me at least the minimum wage.

1474
01:57:52,106 --> 01:57:54,567
Or I’ll report you
to the Department of Labor.

1475
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:55,902
-What?
-Hey, Hyun-jung.

1476
01:57:56,152 --> 01:57:58,404
Report her for me as well
and I’ll raise your allowance.

1477
01:57:58,488 --> 01:57:59,822
Like father like daughter!

1478
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:00,740
Goodbye.

1479
01:58:00,823 --> 01:58:02,867
-Keep kneading!
-Yes, ma’am!

1480
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,703
Get changed right away!

1481
01:58:05,787 --> 01:58:07,121
-Boss.
-Okay.

1482
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,414
Where do you want this?

1483
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:10,708
Go put it down anywhere.

1484
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:14,504
I was talking to the landlord.

1485
01:58:15,546 --> 01:58:16,964
Put it in the kitchen, please.

1486
01:58:17,048 --> 01:58:21,177
But ma’am, do I have to keep wearing this
in this weather?

1487
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:24,764
There are a lot of high school girls
in the area. Do it as a favor for me.

1488
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:30,436
It's cold, isn't it?

1489
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,689
We'll be opening very soon.

1490
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,401
-Knead! Knead!
-We're Kneading!

1491
01:58:37,485 --> 01:58:39,070
Hurry and get changed!

1492
01:58:39,153 --> 01:58:40,696
Where are my clothes?

1493
01:58:40,988 --> 01:58:43,032
They're in there somewhere!

1494
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:44,367
-Almost done.
-That's it.

1495
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:51,082
-Come on, guys.
-Hurry.

1496
01:58:51,165 --> 01:58:53,209
-How's the food here?
-It looks delicious.

1497
01:58:53,292 --> 01:58:56,629
HYUN-JUNG'S DINER

1498
