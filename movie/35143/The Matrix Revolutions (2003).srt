1
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,220
I got nothing, Sir.

2
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,750
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,810
Nothin' but blue pills.

4
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,540
Should we jack in and try to contact them?

5
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,810
It won't matter, my gut says they're down.

6
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,250
Then we should start back. No, if that ship can still fly, we need it.

7
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,610
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

8
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,420
Search every pipe, every hole, every crack we know. Sweep as wide as possible...

9
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:37,661
...as fast as possible.

10
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,921
Captain, these lines are crawling with calamari.

11
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,551
The sooner we find them, the better.

12
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:49,661
Thought you could use something to eat

13
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,061
Thank you

14
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,101
Any change?

15
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:56,832
No.

16
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:01,862
How's he? He's gonna be fine.

17
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,552
At least until he wakes up.

18
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,352
What do you mean?

19
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:09,402
Captain has some questions for him.

20
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,022
He had better have some good answers.

21
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,593
You see these cuts?

22
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,273
I think they're self-inflicted.

23
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,543
Why? VDTs maybe.

24
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:19,483
I don't know.

25
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,453
But like I said...

26
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:24,233
The answer had better be good.

27
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,123
Roland, I'd like to run another search through the Matrix.

28
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,733
For what?

29
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,774
For Neo.

30
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:35,034
How can he be in the Matrix, Sir? He's not plugged in.

31
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:37,364
Please, for me.

32
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:51,284
This is what keeps bothering me. What?

33
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:56,155
His neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma.

34
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:59,055
The strange thing is, I see these patterns all the time.

35
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,275
Where?

36
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,835
On someone jacked in.

37
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,506
A big bubkis, nada.

38
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,116
He's not in there.

39
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,726
Sir, I got the projections. How long?

40
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,156
Based on the point of entry and the past speed, it looks...

41
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:24,756
...like the machines will be in Zion in just 20 hours.

42
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,837
Jesus H. Christ.

43
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,217
Alright lets move with a purpose.

44
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,707
AK get upstairs, I want you on holographics.

45
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:36,177
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns manned at all times.

46
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,717
Make sure we're running on as few pads as possible.

47
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:39,367
Yes, Sir.

48
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,367
Hey! Hey!

49
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,377
You got a call!

50
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,138
Operator.

51
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,808
It's Seraph.

52
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:51,778
I bring word from the Oracle.

53
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:53,558
You must come at once.

54
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,639
Good morning.

55
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,539
Who are you?

56
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:13,159
My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

57
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,609
My papa says you're not supposed to be here.

58
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,559
He says you must be lost. Are you lost Neo?

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,550
Where am I?

60
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,360
This is the train station.

61
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,910
But this isn't the Matrix?

62
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,860
That's where the train goes, that's where we're going.

63
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,381
But you cannot go with us.

64
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,221
Why not?

65
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,691
He won't let you.

66
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,051
Who won't?

67
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,701
The Trainman, I don't like him...

68
00:04:46,011 --> 00:04:50,031
...but my papa says we have to do what the Trainman says.

69
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,891
Or else he will leave us here for ever and ever.

70
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:10,062
Morpheus, Trinity.

71
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:11,773
Thank you for coming.

72
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,713
One thing I've learned in all my years...

73
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:19,113
...is that nothing ever works out just the way we want it to.

74
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:20,293
Who are you?

75
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,253
I'm the Oracle.

76
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:28,223
I wish there was an easier way to get through this but there ain't.

77
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,644
I'm sorry this had to happen.

78
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:36,034
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here like you remember me.

79
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,804
But it wasn't meant to be.

80
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,074
What happened?

81
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:42,644
I made a choice. And that choice cost me more...

82
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,364
...than I wanted it to.

83
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:45,484
What choice?

84
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,765
To help you, to guide Neo.

85
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,735
Now, since the real test for any choice...

86
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:54,235
...is having to make the same choice again...

87
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,575
...knowing full well what it might cost...

88
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,335
...I guess I feel pretty good about that choice...

89
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:05,005
...'cause here I am, at it again.

90
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,066
Do you know what happened to Neo?

91
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,256
Yes.

92
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:13,786
He's trapped in a place between this world and the machine world.

93
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:18,356
The link is controlled by a program called the Trainman.

94
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:22,876
He used to smuggle programs in and out of the Matrix.

95
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:26,847
If he finds out where Neo is before you get to him...

96
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:30,497
...then I'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult.

97
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,337
Why?

98
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,847
Because of who the Trainman works for.

99
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,187
The Merovingian.

100
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:40,087
He's placed a bounty on your lives. You must be careful at all times.

101
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:44,948
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman, he'll go with you.

102
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:47,998
For years he has protected me.

103
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,788
I hope he can do the same for you.

104
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:55,028
Please, follow me.

105
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,409
Oracle.

106
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,089
I know Morpheus.

107
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,749
I can see you're filled with doubt, clouded by uncertainty.

108
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,049
After everything that has happened...

109
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,429
How can you expect me to believe you?

110
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:14,869
I don't.

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,880
I expect just what I've always expected.

112
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,790
For you to make up your own damn mind.

113
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,610
Believe me or don't.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,740
All I can do is to tell you that your friend is in trouble...

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
...and he needs your help.

116
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,640
He needs all our help.

117
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,890
Are you from the Matrix?

118
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,571
Yes. No.

119
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,681
I mean I was.

120
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:39,221
Why did you leave?

121
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:44,721
I had to. I had to leave my home too.

122
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:46,981
Sati, come here darling.

123
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,641
Leave the poor man in peace.

124
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,241
Yes papa.

125
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,822
I am sorry, she's still very curious.

126
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:02,702
I know you. Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

127
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:06,152
I'm Rama-Kandra. This is my wife Kamala.

128
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,632
My daughter Sati.

129
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:10,392
We are most honoured to meet you.

130
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,053
You are programs.

131
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:17,173
Oh yes! I'm the power plant systems manager for recycling operations.

132
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:21,483
My wife is an interactive software programmer. She's highly creative.

133
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,143
What are you doing here? You do not belong here.

134
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:26,573
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.

135
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:28,934
My wife can be very direct.

136
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,684
It's ok.

137
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,814
I don't have an answer.

138
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:35,644
I don't even know where 'here' is.

139
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,594
This place is nowhere.

140
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:40,944
It is between your world and our world.

141
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:45,284
Who's the Trainman? He works for the Frenchman.

142
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:47,465
Why did I know you were going to say that...

143
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,385
The Frenchman does not forget.

144
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,005
And he does not forgive.

145
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,705
You know him? I know only what I need to know.

146
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:58,485
I know that if you want to take something from our world into your world...

147
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:01,875
...that does not belong there, you must go to the Frenchman.

148
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,116
Is that what you are doing here?

149
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:07,696
Rama, please! I do not want to be cruel Kamala.

150
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:10,746
He may never see another face for the rest of his life.

151
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,356
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,696
You don't have to answer that question.

153
00:09:14,796 --> 00:09:16,166
No, I don't mind.

154
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,776
The answer is simple.

155
00:09:24,627 --> 00:09:26,867
I love my daughter very much.

156
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:30,417
I find her to be the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

157
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,257
But where we're from that is not enough.

158
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:36,777
Every program that is created must have a purpose.

159
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,397
If it does not, it is deleted.

160
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:43,318
I went to the Frenchman to save my daughter.

161
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,918
You do not understand? I just have never...

162
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:51,998
Heard a program speak of love.

163
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:54,488
It's a human emotion.

164
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,098
No, it's a word.

165
00:09:56,099 --> 00:10:02,099
What matters is the connection the word implies.

166
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,949
I see that you are in love.

167
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,089
Can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?

168
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:12,739
Anything.

169
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,510
Then perhaps the reason you're here, isn't so different from the reason I'm here.

170
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,700
That's him.

171
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,890
Get away! Get away from me!

172
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,551
We don't want trouble.

173
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,301
Get the hell away from me! We need your help.

174
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:39,051
I can't help you. No one can help you.

175
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:31,134
Oh, no.

176
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:44,995
Damn it.

177
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,875
When is the train due?

178
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,025
It's already late.

179
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:54,875
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

180
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,285
You think it has something to do with me?

181
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,525
I cannot say. Who knows such thing?

182
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,196
Only the Oracle. You know the Oracle?

183
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:05,216
Everyone knows the Oracle.

184
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,626
I consulted with her before i met with the Frenchman.

185
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,616
She promised she would look after Sati after we said goodbye.

186
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,066
Goodbye?

187
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,206
You're not staying with her?

188
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,726
It is not possible.

189
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:19,336
Our arrangement with the Frenchman was for our daughter only.

190
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:22,207
My wife and I must return to our world.

191
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,407
Why?

192
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,107
That is our karma.

193
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:26,627
You believe in karma?

194
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:29,367
Karma is a word, like love.

195
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:34,237
A way of saying 'what I'm here to do'.

196
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,267
I do not resent my karma.

197
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:41,608
I'm grateful for it, grateful for my wonderful wife, for my beautiful daughter.

198
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:46,428
They are gifts. And so I do what I must do to honour them.

199
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:50,728
Papa, the train! Yes! Find your bag!

200
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,038
Quickly!

201
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,049
Can I carry that for you?

202
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,159
All right.

203
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:06,639
Hurry it up! I'm late!

204
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,819
Who are you? He is a friend.

205
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,090
Rama! I know you.

206
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,660
So that's what they wanted.

207
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,610
I need to get back.

208
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll pay you whatever you want.

209
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,580
One way or another I'm getting on this train.

210
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,840
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,261
You're gonna stay right here until the Merovingian says different.

212
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:38,241
If I know him, you're gonna be here for a long, long time.

213
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,451
I don't wanna hurt you.

214
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:45,121
You don't get it. I built this place.

215
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:50,581
Down here I make the rules. Down here I make the threats.

216
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:58,652
Down here, I'm God.

217
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,022
Get on the train or you're gonna stay here with him.

218
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:22,963
We should return to the Oracle. She will know what to do.

219
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,214
No.

220
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:27,234
We know what has to be done.

221
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,015
Shit!

222
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:13,186
You gotta be kidding.

223
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,616
Holy shit. It's wingless.

224
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:21,247
I get it. You must be ready to die.

225
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,307
I need to speak with him.

226
00:15:23,377 --> 00:15:25,197
Only way you're getting through this door...

227
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:28,807
...is over my big dead ass.

228
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,787
So be it.

229
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:56,119
There are no weapons allowed in the club.

230
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,679
At the bottom of this elevator there is a coat-check girl.

231
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,719
And if we're lucky, one man for checking weapons.

232
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,839
And if we're unlucky?

233
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,639
There will be many men.

234
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,259
Can I take your...? Oh my God.

235
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,628
What in the hell?

236
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,958
I don't believe this.

237
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:47,688
Hey!

238
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:49,388
Hey!

239
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:57,599
The prodigal child returns. L' ange sans ailes. (The angel without wings)

240
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:01,549
Are you here for the bounty, Seraph?

241
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:06,329
Tell me, how many bullets are there in those guns?

242
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,209
I don't know, but I don't think you have enough.

243
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,310
We only want to talk. Oh, yes.

244
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm sure you do. You have fought through hell to do so.

245
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,980
Yes. I'll tell you what I'll do.

246
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,720
Put down the guns and I will promise you a safe passage out of here.

247
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,130
All three of us. Oh, yes, yes...

248
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,141
Of course.

249
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:56,412
Quelle bonne surpris, n'est-ce pas? (what a good surprise, isn't it?)

250
00:19:56,522 --> 00:20:00,062
Who could have guessed we would all be seeing each other so soon...

251
00:20:00,472 --> 00:20:05,292
...after our last meeting? A fate too kind.

252
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:09,463
And since you, my little Judas have brought them here...

253
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:13,863
...I can only surmise the fortune teller has found herself another shell.

254
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:15,433
Disappointing.

255
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,613
But not unexpected.

256
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,743
I do hope, however, she has the good manners to learn her lesson.

257
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:24,294
And to remember there is no action without consequence.

258
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,994
And if you take something from me...

259
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:29,764
...you will pay the price.

260
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,164
You know why we are here?

261
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:39,004
Come now, what kind of question is this? Of course I know. It's my business to know.

262
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:42,715
Some might think this is a strange coincidence, but I do not.

263
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:45,335
I'm curious, though, as to...

264
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:48,645
...how it actually happened.

265
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:51,175
Do you know? No.

266
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:52,625
No?

267
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,085
I did not think so.

268
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:58,836
But it is always best to ask.

269
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,196
We want to make a deal.

270
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:08,376
Always straight to business. Uh, Morpheus? Ok.

271
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:11,576
I have something you want.

272
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:16,856
To make a deal, you must have something I want.

273
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:18,007
Yes?

274
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:23,557
And it so happens there is something I want.

275
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:28,277
Something I have wanted ever since I first came here.

276
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,007
It is said they cannot be taken.

277
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:34,158
they can only be given.

278
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,138
What?

279
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,788
The eyes of the Oracle.

280
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:47,948
I have told you before, there's no escaping the nature of the universe.

281
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,768
It is that nature that has again brought you to me.

282
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:54,779
Where some see coincidence, I see consequence.

283
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:58,689
Where others see chance, I see...

284
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,639
...cost.

285
00:22:02,939 --> 00:22:06,299
Bring me the eyes of the Oracle.

286
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,220
And I will give you back your saviour.

287
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,280
It seems a particularly fair and reasonable deal to me.

288
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,730
Yes? No?

289
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,070
I don't have time for this shit.

290
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:55,342
You wanna make a deal? How about this?

291
00:22:55,412 --> 00:23:00,282
You give me Neo, or we all die right here, right now.

292
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:03,083
Interesting deal.

293
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:10,553
You are really ready to die for this man?

294
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,123
Believe it.

295
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:17,933
She'll do it. If she has to she'll kill every one of us.

296
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,254
She's in love. It's remarkable how similar...

297
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:23,144
...the pattern of love is...

298
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:25,754
...to the pattern of insanity.

299
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,324
Time's up.

300
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,834
What's it gonna be Merv?

301
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:37,504
Ok, you got yourself in here.

302
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:40,485
You can get yourself out.

303
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:29,567
Are you ready for us?

304
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,178
Almost, Sir. They got some pretty ancient hacks here, we're working on it.

305
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:33,878
Did you find Neo?

306
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,718
Can't you see him? No, Sir.

307
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,348
We were reading something but I couldn't tell what it was.

308
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:44,478
I can't leave yet.

309
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,289
I have to see her.

310
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,369
Now?

311
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,289
It's my last chance.

312
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,689
That's it, that's the secret.

313
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,579
You've got to use your hands. Why?

314
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,769
Cookies need love, like everything does.

315
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,710
Neo.

316
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,570
I was hoping to have these done before you got here.

317
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,620
Oh, well. Sati, honey...

318
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
...I think it's time for a tasting.

319
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,200
Take the bowl to Seraph and find out if they're ready.

320
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:21,770
Ok.

321
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:27,011
I'm glad you got out. Me too.

322
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,101
So...

323
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,621
Do you recognize me? A part of you.

324
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:37,321
Yeah, that's how it works.

325
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,981
Some bits you lose, some bits you keep.

326
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:44,172
I don't yet recognize my face in the mirror, but...

327
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:47,922
...I still love candy.

328
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,572
No, thank you.

329
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:54,712
Remember what you were like when you first walked through my door?

330
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,382
Jittery as a june bug.

331
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:59,872
And now just look at you.

332
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:03,763
You sure did surprise me, Neo. And you still do.

333
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,483
You gave me a few surprises too.

334
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:09,453
I hope I helped.

335
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:13,143
You helped me to get here, but my question's why.

336
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:15,123
Where is this going?

337
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:16,523
Where does it end?

338
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,744
I don't know. You don't know, or you won't tell me?

339
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,854
I told you before...

340
00:26:21,854 --> 00:26:25,754
no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand.

341
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,624
And I mean no one.

342
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:28,344
What choice?

343
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,864
It doesn't matter.

344
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:34,054
It's my choice. I have mine to make, the same as you have yours.

345
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,455
Does that include what things to tell me and what not to tell me?

346
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:38,495
Of course not.

347
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:40,565
Then why didn't you tell me about the architect?

348
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:43,385
Why didn't you tell me about Zion, the Ones before me?

349
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,205
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

350
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:48,155
Because it wasn't time for you to know.

351
00:26:48,265 --> 00:26:50,055
Who decided it wasn't time?

352
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,325
You know who.

353
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:56,236
KNOW THYSELF

354
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,576
I did.

355
00:27:02,576 --> 00:27:05,616
Then I think it's time for me to know a few more things.

356
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:08,056
So do I.

357
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:11,456
Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.

358
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:15,647
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels by thinking it.

359
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,217
Tell me just what the hell is happening to me.

360
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:24,827
The power of the One extends beyond this world.

361
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,447
It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from.

362
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:29,518
Where?

363
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:34,078
The Source, that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels.

364
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,998
But you weren't ready for it.

365
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:37,948
You should be dead.

366
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,198
But apparently you weren't ready for that either.

367
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:46,218
The architect told me that if I didn't return to the Source...

368
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:48,619
...Zion would be destroyed by midnight tonight.

369
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,809
Please...

370
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:53,329
You and I may not be able to see beyond our own choices...

371
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,769
...but that man can't see past any choice.

372
00:27:56,379 --> 00:28:00,589
Why not? He doesn't understand them. He can't.

373
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:03,229
To him they're variables in an equation.

374
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,720
One at a time each variable must be solved and countered. That's his purpose.

375
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,390
To balance the equation.

376
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,620
What's your purpose?

377
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,980
To unbalance it.

378
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,180
Why?

379
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,030
What do you want?

380
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,680
I want the same thing you want Neo.

381
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:25,831
And I'm willing to go as far as you are to get it.

382
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,731
The end of the war.

383
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:31,131
Is it going to end?

384
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:33,671
One way or another.

385
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:36,911
Can Zion be saved?

386
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:42,761
I'm sorry I don't have the answer to that question, but...

387
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:45,122
If there's an answer...

388
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:48,412
...there's only one place you're going to find it.

389
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:49,702
Where?

390
00:28:49,832 --> 00:28:51,792
You know where.

391
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:55,372
And if you can't find the answer...

392
00:28:56,393 --> 00:29:00,333
...then I'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us.

393
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:03,743
What does that mean?

394
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,963
Everything that has a beginning...

395
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:14,043
...has an end.

396
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:17,064
I see the end coming.

397
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,304
I see the darkness spreading.

398
00:29:20,864 --> 00:29:22,854
I see death.

399
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:26,244
And you are all that stands in his way.

400
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:30,044
Smith. Very soon...

401
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:33,244
...he's going to have the power to destroy this world.

402
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:36,295
But I believe he won't stop there, he can't.

403
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,605
He won't stop until there's nothing left at all.

404
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:43,205
What is he? He is you.

405
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,915
Your opposite. Your negative.

406
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:49,845
The result of the equation trying to balance itself out.

407
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:51,666
And if I can't stop him?

408
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:54,126
One way or another, Neo...

409
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:57,796
...this war is going to end.

410
00:29:58,016 --> 00:30:05,486
Tonight, the future of both worlds will be in your hands or in his.

411
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:22,797
How are you feeling?

412
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,397
Are you alright?

413
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:33,228
I need time.

414
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:40,568
That figures. Captain Roland.

415
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:44,228
What's up Maggie? Bane is. He's conscious.

416
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,789
Good. Maybe he's got some answers.

417
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:55,869
I love that smell.

418
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,839
I sure am gonna miss it.

419
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,400
Oracle. I know, I know.

420
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,350
Sati, honey...

421
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:15,430
Take a few cookies and go with Seraph. Can I come back? I would like to come back.

422
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,120
I would like that too. Then I'll see you tomorrow.

423
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,491
I hope so honey, I hope so.

424
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:48,362
I'm scared Seraph.

425
00:31:49,482 --> 00:31:50,332
Come.

426
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,675
He's following us.

427
00:32:41,455 --> 00:32:44,505
Well, well, it's been a long time.

428
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:52,475
I remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost. I have beaten you before.

429
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:57,336
Yes, true, but as you can see, things are a little different now.

430
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:04,226
And you must be the last exile. The Oracle told me about you.

431
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:06,196
Really?

432
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:10,597
What did she say about me? That you're a bad man.

433
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:13,367
Oh, I'm not so bad...

434
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:16,557
...once you get to know me.

435
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:49,129
The great and powerful Oracle, we meet at last.

436
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:55,039
I suppose you've been expecting me. Right?

437
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:01,589
The all-knowing Oracle is never surprised. How can she be? she knows everything.

438
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:05,530
But if that's true, then why is she here?

439
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,380
If she knew I was coming, why wouldn't she leave?

440
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,900
Maybe you knew I was going to do that, maybe you didn't.

441
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,551
If you did, that means you baked those cookies and...

442
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:22,131
...set that plate right there deliberately, purposefully.

443
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:27,051
Which means that you're sitting there also deliberately, purposefully.

444
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:29,951
What did you do with Sati?

445
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:35,601
Cookies need love, like everything does.

446
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:38,662
You are a bastard.

447
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:42,842
You would know Mom.

448
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,382
Do what you are here to do.

449
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,082
Yes ma'am.

450
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:37,235
I really wish I could help, I just...

451
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,455
I don't remember any of it.

452
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,685
What about the cuts on your arms?

453
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:45,305
Those cuts are more than one day old.

454
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,755
Yeah, definitely.

455
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,356
You're right about that, Sir.

456
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:54,396
They look like they might be self-inflicted.

457
00:35:54,506 --> 00:35:58,476
But, why would I do something like that to myself?

458
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,926
Unless of course I wasn't myself.

459
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:08,836
But if I'm not me, then who am I?

460
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:18,097
Has this man been tested for VDTs? Yes sir, it was negative.

461
00:36:18,187 --> 00:36:21,537
But he's showing a lot of unusual neural activity.

462
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:25,347
Some cross-synaptic firing, as well as signs of recent trauma...

463
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:28,968
...with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex.

464
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:34,708
I want the truth, I don't care what it takes. Make him remember.

465
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,209
Sir, we found her! The Logos?

466
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,570
Yes sir. 'Bout time we had some goddamn good news.

467
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:33,851
Are the thermals picking up any signs of life?

468
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:36,572
No sir. Nothing yet.

469
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:40,142
What about the ship? Holographic says the hull's intact.

470
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,202
Drop her down, and keep a man in the rear turret.

471
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:43,042
Yes, Sir.

472
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:58,133
Get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible.

473
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:19,254
Careful sir, the squids are sneaky bastards.

474
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:21,444
Could be a trap.

475
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,616
What was that?

476
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:54,956
You can put that shit away boys, all she needs is a jump.

477
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:56,526
Niobe.

478
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,886
Morpheus.

479
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:05,097
Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine.

480
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,857
We didn't know what happened after...

481
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:11,157
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:12,497
It's ok...

483
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:15,537
I'm happy to see you too.

484
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,187
Did you get Neo out? Yes.

485
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:20,387
How did you know about that? The Oracle.

486
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:23,898
You saw her? Just before the Sentinels found us.

487
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:24,908
What did she tell you?

488
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:28,198
The same things she always does.

489
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,498
Exactly what I needed to hear.

490
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:36,438
In less than 12 hours the machines will breach the dock walls.

491
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:41,078
Every simulation we've run, we've seen that once the machines are inside the city...

492
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,989
...the odds of our survival decrease dramatically.

493
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,599
Thus our primary objective must be to destroy...

494
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:49,929
...or disable the diggers inside the dock.

495
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:53,769
If we can do that, perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city.

496
00:39:54,189 --> 00:39:56,189
If not, the only place we would be able to mount an...

497
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,810
...effective defense would be at the entrance of the Temple.

498
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,560
It's small enough that it would force them into a bottleneck...

499
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,070
...allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense.

500
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,180
We understand that you've requested additional volunteers.

501
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,350
That is correct.

502
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,740
Precisely what size of force are you planning...

503
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,640
...to commit to the primary dock objective?

504
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:19,081
Right now, the entire APU Corps and half the infantry.

505
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:22,371
Half the infantry? If it were up to me Councillor...

506
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:25,061
I'd take every man, woman and child, put a gun in...

507
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:27,561
...their hand and march them straight into that dock.

508
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,561
Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you.

509
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:33,131
Time will tell, Councillor.

510
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,782
Commander, just one more question.

511
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:38,742
Has there been word from the Nebuchadnezzar? None.

512
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:41,892
And at this point there's no reason to expect there ever will be.

513
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,282
Perhaps.

514
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,502
But we can hope.

515
00:40:45,532 --> 00:40:50,552
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence I don't have time for.

516
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:02,183
Zee, what are you doing?

517
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:03,933
Making shells.

518
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:06,673
They're evacuating our level, we have to go.

519
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,623
I'm not going with you. What?

520
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:13,264
They've called for volunteers to hold the dock.

521
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,524
Kids, you stay here.

522
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:23,794
I know how you feel, Zee, but you can't do this.

523
00:41:23,804 --> 00:41:24,914
I have to. Why?

524
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,745
Because I love him.

525
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:30,765
I love him the same as he loves me.

526
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:34,425
And if I were out there and he were here I know what he'd do.

527
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,505
But you're gonna get yourself killed.

528
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:39,765
It's crazy Zee.

529
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,135
Maybe it is.

530
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,475
But ask yourself, if it were Dozer, you knew the only...

531
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:48,166
...chance you had to see him again was to hold the dock.

532
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,046
What would you do?

533
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:57,356
Make shells.

534
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:10,937
What the shit is going on over here?

535
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,977
An accident, sir.

536
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:16,297
I didn't see, sorry.

537
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:19,937
Who the hell are you? A unit volunteer sir.

538
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:24,888
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you doing volunteering for my corps?

539
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:26,818
I wanna do my part, sir!

540
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:29,428
We gotta hold the dock.

541
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:30,768
How old are you, kid?

542
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:34,678
Eighteen. Should have said sixteen, I might have believed that!

543
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:38,418
Ok, I'm sixteen. Minimum age for the corps is 18.

544
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,089
Sixteen's too young.

545
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:45,619
Machines don't care how old I am. They'll kill me just the same.

546
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,219
Ain't that the goddamned truth.

547
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,229
Give me a chance, Sir.

548
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,209
I won't let you down.

549
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:58,489
You do, and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common.

550
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,740
Ok, charge the igniter.

551
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:21,271
She lives again.

552
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:24,881
You want us to patch an uplink to reload the operations software, Sparky?

553
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:29,211
Yeah, that'd be swell. Could you clean the windshield while you're at it?

554
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,992
Uplinks are in place, I'm bringing her back online.

555
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:39,302
Looking good, except uh...

556
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,942
Something's wrong with the Matrix feed.

557
00:43:42,962 --> 00:43:43,952
No there's not.

558
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,012
You're looking at what we're looking at.

559
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:47,492
What the hell is going on in there?

560
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:50,303
Whatever it is, it can't be good.

561
00:43:50,593 --> 00:43:53,443
The machines have taken Junction 21.

562
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:56,783
The way I see it, if we drop down from broadcast here...

563
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:59,343
...at Interstate 153, we might surprise them.

564
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:04,363
We'll go first, hammer as deep as we can, then blow our EMP.

565
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:08,233
Hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through.

566
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:14,074
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it, it's the only way back.

567
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,004
No it's not.

568
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:18,044
There's another way.

569
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:19,594
A support line.

570
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:21,334
It drops down right here.

571
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:23,474
A thousand meters short of 21.

572
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:27,725
If we're lucky we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing.

573
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:31,625
That's a mechanical line. It's impossible, no one can pilot a mechanical.

574
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,485
I can.

575
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:33,335
Bullshit.

576
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:36,765
I've done it. That was a long time ago, Niobe.

577
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:38,315
I said I can do it.

578
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:40,985
So what? If you can you'll be the only one that can.

579
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:42,796
There's no way we can follow you.

580
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:46,746
Hi.

581
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:53,016
I know time is always against us. I'm sorry that I took so long.

582
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,706
But I wanted to be sure. Sure of what?

583
00:44:57,206 --> 00:44:59,676
I know what I have to do. What?

584
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:02,867
There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just say it.

585
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:04,827
I have to take one of the ships.

586
00:45:04,837 --> 00:45:07,167
What? To go where?

587
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:10,847
To the machine city.

588
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,787
I know it's difficult to understand.

589
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:19,798
No, It's not, you're out of your goddamn mind.

590
00:45:19,808 --> 00:45:22,788
I still have to go. You'll never make it. In 100 years...

591
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,998
...no ship has been within a hundred kilometers of it.

592
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:27,318
You'll never make it. I have to try.

593
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:29,538
Is this what the Oracle has told you?

594
00:45:29,848 --> 00:45:30,918
No.

595
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:34,548
This is asinine. If you wanna kill yourself, go do it.

596
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:36,649
But do it without wasting one of our ships.

597
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:38,879
You have to believe me, I have to go.

598
00:45:38,879 --> 00:45:39,419
Bullshit!

599
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:42,799
I am the captain of this ship, I say where it has to go!

600
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:47,649
And believe me, this ship will go to hell long before I let you take it anywhere.

601
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,309
He can take mine.

602
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,210
You can't do that.

603
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,430
Don't even think of trying to tell me what I can...

604
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,030
...or cannot do with my ship after that little speech.

605
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,040
But for Christ sake, Niobe. I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

606
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,900
If we leave inside the hour we should reach Zion as the machines do.

607
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,140
That's as good a plan as any.

608
00:46:12,411 --> 00:46:15,681
It's a waste. A Goddamn waste.

609
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:24,191
Two ships, two directions.

610
00:46:24,461 --> 00:46:28,341
Sounds like providence, doesn't it Morpheus?

611
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,382
You've never believed in The One.

612
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:34,982
I still don't. Then why are you doing this?

613
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,662
I believe in him.

614
00:46:38,772 --> 00:46:39,792
Thank you.

615
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:49,173
What's that for? To help you relax.

616
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:52,063
Make it easier for you to remember.

617
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:55,673
What if i don't want to remember?

618
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:58,003
Why would you want that?

619
00:46:58,053 --> 00:47:00,823
What if I blew that EMP?

620
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,453
What if I did destroy those ships and I am responsible...

621
00:47:05,464 --> 00:47:08,964
...for the deaths of all those men?

622
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:17,864
If I did that, it wouldn't be very safe for me here.

623
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:18,914
Would it?

624
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:32,405
Of course it might not be very safe for you, either.

625
00:47:40,046 --> 00:47:42,056
I'm ready.

626
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:44,406
Trinity.

627
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,806
There's something I have to say.

628
00:47:51,906 --> 00:47:54,586
There's something you need to understand.

629
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,756
I know I'm supposed to go.

630
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:04,017
But beyond that... I don't know I...

631
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:09,517
I know. You don't think you're coming back.

632
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:13,317
I knew it the moment you said you had to leave.

633
00:48:13,437 --> 00:48:15,717
I could see it in your face.

634
00:48:15,748 --> 00:48:18,048
Just like you knew the moment you looked at me...

635
00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:21,338
...that I was coming with you.

636
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:26,708
I'm scared Trin. So am I.

637
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:31,728
It took me ten minutes to buckle up one boot.

638
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,858
But I'll tell you something. Six hours ago...

639
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,009
...I told the Merovingian I was ready...

640
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:41,599
...to give anything and everything for you.

641
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:46,179
You know what's changed in the last 6 hours?

642
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:47,149
No.

643
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,099
Nothing.

644
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,390
Have you finished loading that amunition? Just about, sir.

645
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,950
Lets move it, we're out of time.

646
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,250
You're not leaving them anything?

647
00:49:10,341 --> 00:49:12,451
He said he didn't need it.

648
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:20,441
I ain't saying goodbye, I'm saying good luck.

649
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:21,571
Thank you.

650
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,552
I can only hope you know what you're doing.

651
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:31,692
Me too.

652
00:49:35,592 --> 00:49:38,872
It was an honour, Sir.

653
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:45,132
No, the honour's still mine.

654
00:49:57,413 --> 00:49:58,523
We're ready sir.

655
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:00,613
'Bout damn time.

656
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:05,163
We're already late Captain, so lets hit it and hit it hard.

657
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:13,204
Bye baby, take good care of them.

658
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:36,305
Ready?

659
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:46,056
Engine's still firing.

660
00:50:46,316 --> 00:50:49,946
Must be a fuse, I'll check it out.

661
00:51:03,177 --> 00:51:06,177
I should've known he'd send his bitch first.

662
00:51:06,177 --> 00:51:06,677
Bane!

663
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:10,237
No one ever got away from me as many times as you did.

664
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,387
Every single time I thought it was the last.

665
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:16,027
Everytime I was sure we had you, but somehow you'd slip through our fingers.

666
00:51:16,178 --> 00:51:21,198
I really can't express just how aggravating that can be.

667
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:23,578
What are you talking about?

668
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:29,278
I think I might enjoy killing you as much as killing him.

669
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:48,559
Neo, it's Bane, he's psychotic!

670
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,250
You're gonna pay for that.

671
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,150
27 kilometers to go.

672
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,700
Captain, we got an emergency down here. What is it AK?

673
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,950
It's Maggie, sir.

674
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,130
She's dead.

675
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,240
Murdered. I think it was Bane. Goddamn it.

676
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,420
I knew it. I knew he was out of his goddamn mind.

677
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:14,551
He fired that EMP. God damn it, I should have beaten it out of him.

678
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:17,251
We've searched the whole ship Captain.

679
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:19,461
He ain't here.

680
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:23,031
I know where he is. The Logos.

681
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:26,101
We gotta go back. Too late.

682
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:27,872
You don't know that, what if they need our help?

683
00:52:27,962 --> 00:52:29,912
It's too dangerous. Why?

684
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:33,502
Because if he's killed them, he will control another EMP.

685
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,672
At this point they're on their own.

686
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:38,182
Just like us.

687
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:41,052
Mr. Anderson...

688
00:52:42,363 --> 00:52:46,233
I see you're as predictable in this world as you are in the other.

689
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:48,533
What? He's out of his mind.

690
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:50,143
It might appear that way to you, but Mr. Anderson...

691
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:54,343
...and I know that appearances can be deceiving.

692
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:57,143
Confused, Mr. Anderson?

693
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,863
It'll all become clear in a moment.

694
00:52:58,963 --> 00:53:01,793
Now, thank you for bringing me the gun. You can set it down right there.

695
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:03,134
Don't do it.

696
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:06,204
Shoot, shoot now.

697
00:53:06,204 --> 00:53:08,964
Yes, shoot. Fry us. Burn us alive!

698
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:12,054
Do it! If you don't he'll kill us both.

699
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:17,014
Look at him. He knows he should do it, but he won't.

700
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:19,794
He can't. Do it.

701
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,985
Back away from the gun and turn around.

702
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:39,626
Let her go.

703
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:55,626
Somehow familiar, isn't it?

704
00:53:56,097 --> 00:54:00,127
We've been here before, you and I, remember?

705
00:54:00,457 --> 00:54:01,547
I do

706
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:05,127
I think of nothing else

707
00:54:08,427 --> 00:54:12,267
Who are you? Still don't recognize me?

708
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:17,298
I admit, it's difficult to even think, encased in this rotting piece of meat.

709
00:54:17,308 --> 00:54:23,448
The stink of it filling every breath, a suffocating cloud you can't escape.

710
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:26,948
Disgusting.

711
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:30,558
Look at how pathetically fragile it is.

712
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:34,039
Nothing this weak is meant to survive.

713
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:40,469
What do you want?

714
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:43,289
I want what you want.

715
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:46,949
Yes...

716
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,880
That's it Mr. Anderson.

717
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,960
Look past the flesh, look through the soft gelatin...

718
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,570
...of these dull cow eyes, and see your enemy.

719
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,300
No.

720
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,880
Oh, yes, Mr. Anderson.

721
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,230
It can't be.

722
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,310
There's nowhere I can't go, there's nowhere I won't find you.

723
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:10,611
It's impossible.

724
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:12,951
Not impossible.

725
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:15,561
Inevitable.

726
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:19,011
Goodbye Mr. Anderson.

727
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:21,351
This is it, it's gotta be.

728
00:56:06,394 --> 00:56:08,284
Oh no!

729
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:30,095
I wish you could see yourself Mr. Anderson.

730
00:56:33,075 --> 00:56:36,945
The blind messiah.

731
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:44,416
You're a symbol for all of your kind, Mr. Anderson.

732
00:56:46,646 --> 00:56:48,936
Helpless.

733
00:56:51,276 --> 00:56:53,846
Pathetic.

734
00:56:56,297 --> 00:57:00,627
Just waiting to be put out of your misery.

735
00:57:06,027 --> 00:57:08,337
I can see you.

736
00:57:16,378 --> 00:57:21,928
It's not over Mr. Anderson, it's not over.

737
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:37,509
Trinity! Neo.

738
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:45,539
Oh, no.

739
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,290
Your eyes.

740
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,370
I'll be ok.

741
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,770
It's alright Trin.

742
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,050
But I think you're gonna have to drive.

743
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:07,621
Seismic's projecting 22 minutes to breach.

744
00:58:07,631 --> 00:58:11,151
They can't know we don't have an EMP. They'll have to attack in waves.

745
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:14,321
Concentrate our offense on the diggers.

746
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:16,721
Order the APUs into position.

747
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:17,581
Yes, sir.

748
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:50,083
Come on, move.

749
00:59:22,695 --> 00:59:23,665
All right.

750
00:59:24,315 --> 00:59:26,285
This is it.

751
00:59:26,435 --> 00:59:28,045
Now, you all know me,

752
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:31,845
so I'll just say this as simple as I can.

753
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:36,246
If it's our time to die, it's our time.

754
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:42,036
All I ask is: if we have to give these bastards our lives...

755
00:59:42,106 --> 00:59:45,886
...we give them hell before we do!

756
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:03,607
You scared, Charra?

757
01:00:03,677 --> 01:00:05,287
Shit, yeah.

758
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:08,057
But I'll make you a deal.

759
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,908
You keep loadin', I keep shootin'.

760
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,208
Deal.

761
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:27,348
Holy Christ, would you look at that? Quiet.

762
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:31,289
How far is the opening? 1.4 kilometers

763
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,899
We're still generating too hot a field.

764
01:00:33,939 --> 01:00:36,029
Ghost, kill all auxilliary systems.

765
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,809
Give me full manual, drop down four pads.

766
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:41,159
It'll bottom out!

767
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,970
Easy baby.

768
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,840
700 meters.

769
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,290
If we can just get close enough.

770
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:04,601
600 meters.

771
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:06,411
There.

772
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:15,941
Shit.

773
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:21,061
Jig's up, here they come. Give me full power, full systems!

774
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:22,792
Man the gun turrets! every goddamn one of them.

775
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:26,072
Go, go! Ghost, you're the best gunner we have, go with them.

776
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:28,332
Morpheus take his place.

777
01:01:45,043 --> 01:01:46,773
I'm coming baby.

778
01:01:56,104 --> 01:01:57,624
Here they come.

779
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:07,884
Slow down, this ain't the Logos! Hold on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.

780
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,975
Holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.

781
01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:13,238
Breach! The dock is breached!

782
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,999
Knuckle up!

783
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,530
For Zion!

784
01:05:57,817 --> 01:05:59,027
Shit.

785
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,407
Come on, let's go!

786
01:06:11,328 --> 01:06:13,678
Knuckle up!

787
01:06:28,829 --> 01:06:30,619
Reload!

788
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,439
Reload nine!

789
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,250
Go, go! Move, move!

790
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,710
Watch your left!

791
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:59,550
Don't let them through!

792
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:03,831
Zuka!

793
01:07:40,573 --> 01:07:42,873
Oh my God.

794
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:57,644
Where the hell is my infantry?

795
01:07:57,684 --> 01:08:00,224
I want that goddamn machine taken down!

796
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,277
Dig this.

797
01:08:39,057 --> 01:08:41,177
Oh, shit!

798
01:09:00,398 --> 01:09:03,778
Bogey two at the breach point! Goddamnit.

799
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,220
Shit, she's got a fat ass!

800
01:09:40,921 --> 01:09:44,641
Keep 'em off me. Goddamn, there's a shitstorm of 'em.

801
01:10:15,923 --> 01:10:20,053
Captain, do you see that? They're after the radio, stop 'em.

802
01:10:26,703 --> 01:10:27,833
Damn it.

803
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:53,705
Yeah.

804
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:07,635
Grab my belt.

805
01:11:18,386 --> 01:11:21,226
Just give me one clean shot.

806
01:11:26,857 --> 01:11:27,787
Damn it!

807
01:11:50,658 --> 01:11:52,288
Charra!

808
01:11:57,428 --> 01:11:58,598
Commander Lock, I've got incoming!

809
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:01,648
I've got a dock full of incoming! Sir, yes Sir, but this is different, Sir.

810
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:04,539
What? I think it's one of ours.

811
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:07,749
That's impossible. Holographics are trying to confirm, Sir.

812
01:12:08,519 --> 01:12:12,319
Contact them, I want access codes. We're trying Sir, there's no response.

813
01:12:14,049 --> 01:12:17,059
It's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be.

814
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:20,879
That's a mechanical line, no one can pilot mechanical.

815
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:32,930
Foreward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent.

816
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,260
30 degrees, 80.

817
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:40,561
Lower starboard, 60 degrees, 20 percent. 60 degrees.

818
01:12:43,061 --> 01:12:43,681
Shit!

819
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:45,551
Come on, keep up! I'm trying!

820
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,522
Sir, holographic confirms.

821
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,762
It's the Hammer Sir.

822
01:13:08,812 --> 01:13:10,182
How can that be?

823
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,622
The ship is under attack, sustaining heavy damage.

824
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:15,823
But at its present velocity it'll reach Gate 3 in 12 minutes.

825
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:19,093
Sir, their EMP could take out every sentinel up there.

826
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:20,283
It'd take out more than that.

827
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:22,563
It'll wipe out our entire defense system.

828
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:25,203
We blow an EMP inside, we will lose the dock.

829
01:13:25,373 --> 01:13:27,963
Sir, we've already lost the dock.

830
01:13:31,844 --> 01:13:33,294
Open the gate.

831
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:36,014
Gate 3 is not responding!

832
01:13:36,664 --> 01:13:38,564
It's taken critical damage, Sir!

833
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,194
We've lost control!

834
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:41,494
We can't open it!

835
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:54,215
There's the exit. On my mark, give me full power.

836
01:13:54,255 --> 01:13:56,085
90 degrees to lower-left starboard.

837
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:57,595
Full power.

838
01:13:58,315 --> 01:14:00,185
90 degrees.

839
01:14:06,046 --> 01:14:06,656
Now!

840
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,156
Hold on, baby!

841
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:23,816
Goddamn woman, you can drive!

842
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,587
We ain't home yet. What about the Gate?

843
01:14:28,037 --> 01:14:30,757
The sentinels are inside the dock.

844
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:33,347
Are we too late?

845
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:04,959
How many APUs are operational? Thirteen, Sir.

846
01:15:05,059 --> 01:15:07,769
Get me the one closest to Gate 3.

847
01:15:35,271 --> 01:15:36,811
Reload!

848
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:38,411
He's pissin' metal.

849
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:42,261
Go!

850
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:22,533
Heads up, they're coming around!!

851
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,094
Behind you!

852
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:53,435
It's jammed!

853
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:01,015
Forget it, Kid! Get outta here!

854
01:17:02,105 --> 01:17:04,145
Got it!

855
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,097
Captain Mifune!

856
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,307
No.

857
01:17:39,908 --> 01:17:41,018
They're coming.

858
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:47,418
They're coming. The Hammer.

859
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:48,878
What?

860
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:52,878
You have to open that gate.

861
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:56,178
Cut the counterweights.

862
01:17:57,569 --> 01:17:59,629
You can do it.

863
01:18:00,029 --> 01:18:02,679
Hurry, there's no time.

864
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,879
Captain. I didn't finish the training program.

865
01:18:11,009 --> 01:18:13,209
Neither did I.

866
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:35,971
Lock that down.

867
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:37,541
Kill the feeder.

868
01:18:37,541 --> 01:18:40,331
We won't make it. we gotta blow the EMP now.

869
01:18:40,831 --> 01:18:44,431
Come on, someone, please!

870
01:18:58,112 --> 01:18:59,972
Keep the weight forward.

871
01:19:02,262 --> 01:19:04,692
Light as a feather, light as a feather.

872
01:19:08,742 --> 01:19:13,862
Commander, holographics reports Captain Mifune's APU is up and moving to Gate 3.

873
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:21,003
Don't oversqueeze the trigger.

874
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,844
Captain Mifune's APU just reached Gate 3.

875
01:19:33,944 --> 01:19:36,544
How much time? Two minutes to impact.

876
01:19:37,374 --> 01:19:38,704
Captain Mifune, do you copy?

877
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:40,424
His radio is down, Sir.

878
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,164
Mifune...

879
01:19:42,854 --> 01:19:43,894
This is Lock.

880
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,405
I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can...

881
01:19:47,835 --> 01:19:50,095
...the Hammer is two minutes away.

882
01:19:50,255 --> 01:19:52,045
You got two minutes, Captain...

883
01:19:52,085 --> 01:19:55,125
...to get that Gate open.

884
01:19:56,305 --> 01:19:57,505
Link!

885
01:19:58,615 --> 01:20:01,005
Get to the main deck! Charge the EMP!

886
01:20:37,137 --> 01:20:38,807
Do it, Kid.

887
01:20:42,798 --> 01:20:46,038
Neo, I believe.

888
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:56,028
Yes.

889
01:20:56,359 --> 01:20:58,069
Can we make it?

890
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:00,759
We ain't come this far.

891
01:21:11,749 --> 01:21:13,229
Almost home.

892
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,720
Almost home.

893
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:36,501
Burn it Link!

894
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,272
You did it.

895
01:22:01,642 --> 01:22:04,642
No, we did it.

896
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:08,132
You're a hell of a pilot.

897
01:22:09,503 --> 01:22:13,493
Some things in this world never change.

898
01:22:13,603 --> 01:22:15,833
But some things do?

899
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:20,893
Luckily, some things do.

900
01:22:32,234 --> 01:22:33,724
Link!

901
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:34,374
Zee?

902
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:36,024
Link? Zee!

903
01:22:42,154 --> 01:22:46,064
I knew you'd come. I knew it.

904
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:48,885
I made a promise.

905
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,585
You did wear it.

906
01:22:59,915 --> 01:23:03,345
Are you kidding? I'm never gonna take it off.

907
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:15,076
Three captains, one ship

908
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:19,076
I'll assume the other ships were lost under equally pointless circumstances

909
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:21,187
It's good to see you too, Jason

910
01:23:21,627 --> 01:23:23,687
The council is waiting to hear your explanation

911
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:27,917
You would forgive me for not attending but I have to try to salvage this debacle

912
01:23:28,687 --> 01:23:31,387
Did I miss something, commander? I thought we'd just saved the dock.

913
01:23:31,487 --> 01:23:33,267
That's the problem with you people.

914
01:23:33,607 --> 01:23:35,627
You can't think for five minutes in front of your face.

915
01:23:36,258 --> 01:23:39,548
The EMP knocked out almost every piece of hardware and every APU.

916
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:42,838
If I were the machines, I would send every sentinel I had here right now

917
01:23:42,858 --> 01:23:47,648
Saved the dock, Captain? You've just handed it to them on a silver platter

918
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:54,478
Come on, get it cut!

919
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:57,969
The bridge is clear

920
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:01,839
Do you hear that?

921
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:05,819
Get that cable run

922
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:07,659
I want the system back online.

923
01:24:07,659 --> 01:24:11,199
Commander, it's the dock. We've got incoming.

924
01:24:11,419 --> 01:24:13,289
Order everyone to fall back.

925
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:17,200
Seal all the shaft. Now!

926
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,030
Move it!

927
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,990
Oh my God!

928
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:33,241
All clear

929
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:34,241
Do it!

930
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:35,141
Go! Go!

931
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:54,762
Your move!

932
01:24:55,022 --> 01:24:57,882
So you gave them your ship.

933
01:24:58,092 --> 01:24:59,832
That is correct, Councillor, I did.

934
01:25:00,482 --> 01:25:03,232
Knowing what he planned to do with it?

935
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:06,592
And the Oracle said nothing of this?

936
01:25:06,733 --> 01:25:09,583
She told me that Neo would need my help and when the time came...

937
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:11,573
...I would choose to help him or not.

938
01:25:11,683 --> 01:25:16,093
But what hope can a single vessel have against their entire defense system?

939
01:25:16,163 --> 01:25:18,003
None, it's completely impossible.

940
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:19,683
But he wouldn't listen.

941
01:25:19,733 --> 01:25:23,483
He wouldn't even take any ammunition. He was totally out of his goddamn mind.

942
01:25:23,864 --> 01:25:26,734
No, he wasn't.

943
01:25:28,784 --> 01:25:30,974
Neo is doing what he believes he must do.

944
01:25:32,844 --> 01:25:34,794
I don't know if what he's doing is right.

945
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:38,874
I don't know if he'll reach the machine city.

946
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:42,164
And if he does, I don't know what he can do to save us.

947
01:25:43,015 --> 01:25:48,275
But I do know that as long as there's single breath in his body...

948
01:25:49,905 --> 01:25:52,075
...he will not give up.

949
01:25:52,975 --> 01:25:55,535
And neither can we.

950
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:03,536
Temperature's dropping.

951
01:26:05,936 --> 01:26:07,966
Here we go.

952
01:26:47,288 --> 01:26:50,008
We're over the fields, aren't we?

953
01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:51,708
How do you know that?

954
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:53,608
I can feel them.

955
01:27:02,559 --> 01:27:03,989
Over there.

956
01:27:05,059 --> 01:27:08,179
There is our path, can you see it?

957
01:27:08,199 --> 01:27:10,879
Three lines. Power lines.

958
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,030
Follow them.

959
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,361
What are they doing?

960
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:33,361
I don't know.

961
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:35,931
Lieutenant!

962
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:53,172
Goddamn it!

963
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:56,182
What do we do now, Commander?

964
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:00,962
It's now a matter of time.

965
01:28:02,732 --> 01:28:06,032
Machines will breach the walls of the city.

966
01:28:06,523 --> 01:28:10,943
I recommend that the Council join the rest of the non-military personnel inside the Temple.

967
01:28:11,003 --> 01:28:13,413
How long do we have?

968
01:28:13,483 --> 01:28:16,063
Two hours, maybe less.

969
01:28:17,823 --> 01:28:23,003
My men have begun fortifying the entrance with enough artillery to make our last stand.

970
01:28:24,114 --> 01:28:26,834
Beyond that there isn't anything more I can do.

971
01:28:27,024 --> 01:28:30,784
Commander, do you think that we have any chance of surviving?

972
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:35,554
If I were you, Councillor, I wouldn't ask me that question.

973
01:28:35,814 --> 01:28:36,814
I would ask him.

974
01:28:37,544 --> 01:28:38,474
Why?

975
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:43,375
Because he's the one who believes in miracles.

976
01:28:49,075 --> 01:28:51,265
There, those mountains.

977
01:28:52,225 --> 01:28:53,415
That's it.

978
01:28:57,616 --> 01:28:59,526
Do you see what's out there? Yes.

979
01:29:00,286 --> 01:29:02,776
If you tell me we'll make it I'll believe you.

980
01:29:02,816 --> 01:29:04,576
We'll make it.

981
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,876
We have to.

982
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,940
Sentinels!

983
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,041
There's too many.

984
01:30:52,652 --> 01:30:54,842
Gotcha!

985
01:30:55,602 --> 01:30:57,272
Come on, Neo, I need help here!

986
01:30:57,272 --> 01:30:58,742
I can't beat them.

987
01:30:58,822 --> 01:31:00,162
What'll we do? Go up!

988
01:31:00,182 --> 01:31:01,332
Over them. What?

989
01:31:01,402 --> 01:31:02,602
The sky.

990
01:31:02,603 --> 01:31:04,183
It's the only way.

991
01:31:05,313 --> 01:31:07,383
Then up we go.

992
01:31:42,235 --> 01:31:43,725
Beautiful.

993
01:32:06,246 --> 01:32:09,066
Pump the igniter, the ship will start.

994
01:32:16,137 --> 01:32:17,367
Again!

995
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:18,577
Slowly.

996
01:32:21,547 --> 01:32:22,917
Now!

997
01:32:48,628 --> 01:32:49,578
Trin?

998
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:53,329
Trinity?

999
01:32:55,239 --> 01:32:56,009
Trinity?!

1000
01:32:57,879 --> 01:33:00,309
I'm here. Where?

1001
01:33:00,519 --> 01:33:01,359
Here.

1002
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,460
We made it.

1003
01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,030
You said we would.

1004
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:21,110
It's unbelievable Trin.

1005
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:24,500
Light everywhere.

1006
01:33:24,751 --> 01:33:27,101
Like the whole thing was built of light.

1007
01:33:27,911 --> 01:33:30,171
I wish you could see what I see.

1008
01:33:31,641 --> 01:33:34,501
You've already shown me so much.

1009
01:33:36,421 --> 01:33:39,831
What is it Trinity? What's wrong?

1010
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:43,741
I can't go with you Neo.

1011
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:47,422
I've gone as far as I can.

1012
01:33:47,552 --> 01:33:48,322
What?

1013
01:33:51,362 --> 01:33:52,852
Oh, no.

1014
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:55,802
Oh, no, no, no!

1015
01:33:56,412 --> 01:33:57,412
It's all right.

1016
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:01,172
It's time.

1017
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:04,913
I've done all that I could do.

1018
01:34:06,393 --> 01:34:09,093
Now you have to do the rest.

1019
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:11,423
You have to finish it.

1020
01:34:11,793 --> 01:34:14,443
You have to save Zion.

1021
01:34:14,623 --> 01:34:16,133
I can't.

1022
01:34:16,763 --> 01:34:18,193
Not without you.

1023
01:34:18,224 --> 01:34:20,004
Yes you can.

1024
01:34:20,564 --> 01:34:22,654
You will.

1025
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:26,954
I believe. I always have.

1026
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:30,004
Trinity.

1027
01:34:32,524 --> 01:34:36,374
Trinity. You can't die.

1028
01:34:38,435 --> 01:34:40,385
You can't.

1029
01:34:40,765 --> 01:34:41,565
You can't.

1030
01:34:42,335 --> 01:34:44,745
Yes, I can.

1031
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:50,215
You brought me back once.

1032
01:34:52,485 --> 01:34:55,185
But not this time.

1033
01:35:00,456 --> 01:35:02,456
Do you remember...

1034
01:35:02,626 --> 01:35:06,066
...on that roof, after you caught me...

1035
01:35:07,526 --> 01:35:11,686
...the last thing I said to you?

1036
01:35:13,287 --> 01:35:15,617
You said: "I'm sorry".

1037
01:35:16,047 --> 01:35:18,407
I wish I hadn't.

1038
01:35:21,187 --> 01:35:24,767
That was my last thought.

1039
01:35:25,927 --> 01:35:28,957
I wished I had one more chance...

1040
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:32,628
...to say what really mattered.

1041
01:35:34,488 --> 01:35:37,398
To say how much I loved you.

1042
01:35:39,578 --> 01:35:43,858
How grateful I was for every moment I was with you.

1043
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:48,958
But by the time I knew how to say what I wanted to...

1044
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:51,039
...it was too late.

1045
01:35:55,909 --> 01:35:59,109
But you brought me back.

1046
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:04,959
You gave me my wish.

1047
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:12,530
One more chance to say what I really wanted to say.

1048
01:36:16,530 --> 01:36:17,920
Kiss me.

1049
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,840
Once more.

1050
01:36:24,901 --> 01:36:26,371
Kiss me.

1051
01:36:53,402 --> 01:36:57,562
Get that ammunition where it belongs! You got one chance to get this right.

1052
01:36:58,092 --> 01:37:00,282
Get that damn thing mounted.

1053
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,773
Hurry. Let's go, let's go!

1054
01:37:22,274 --> 01:37:23,314
Neo...

1055
01:37:24,284 --> 01:37:27,154
If you're gonna do something, you better do it quick.

1056
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:37,881
I only ask to say what I've come to say.

1057
01:39:37,881 --> 01:39:41,421
After that, do what you want, and I won't try to stop you.

1058
01:39:45,472 --> 01:39:46,562
Speak!

1059
01:39:47,972 --> 01:39:50,972
The program 'Smith' has grown beyond your control.

1060
01:39:51,002 --> 01:39:54,392
Soon he will spread through this city as he spread through the Matrix.

1061
01:39:54,472 --> 01:39:57,232
You cannot stop him.

1062
01:39:58,083 --> 01:39:59,313
But I can.

1063
01:39:59,323 --> 01:40:01,493
We don't need you.

1064
01:40:01,573 --> 01:40:04,703
We need nothing.

1065
01:40:04,783 --> 01:40:06,773
If that's true, then I've made a mistake.

1066
01:40:06,853 --> 01:40:09,453
And you should kill me now.

1067
01:40:13,813 --> 01:40:15,353
What do you want?

1068
01:40:17,194 --> 01:40:18,824
Peace.

1069
01:40:44,135 --> 01:40:46,325
What are they doing?

1070
01:40:51,676 --> 01:40:53,846
What are you doing!?

1071
01:40:56,406 --> 01:40:58,226
Morpheus!

1072
01:41:23,127 --> 01:41:25,767
And if you fail?

1073
01:41:27,398 --> 01:41:28,928
I won't.

1074
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:51,489
Neo.

1075
01:41:52,599 --> 01:41:54,759
He fights for us.

1076
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:38,711
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.

1077
01:42:39,092 --> 01:42:41,602
We missed you.

1078
01:42:45,362 --> 01:42:48,602
You like what I've done with the place?

1079
01:42:48,852 --> 01:42:51,092
It ends tonight.

1080
01:42:51,472 --> 01:42:54,512
I know it does. I've seen it.

1081
01:42:54,582 --> 01:42:58,682
That's why the rest of me is just going to enjoy the show.

1082
01:42:58,793 --> 01:43:03,233
We already know that I'm the one that beats you.

1083
01:44:54,439 --> 01:44:57,219
Can you feel it Mr. Anderson?

1084
01:44:57,579 --> 01:44:59,909
Closing in on you.

1085
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,010
Oh, I can.

1086
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:07,800
I really should thank you for it, after all, it was your life...

1087
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:11,330
...that taught me the purpose of all life.

1088
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,340
The purpose of life is to end.

1089
01:48:51,332 --> 01:48:54,232
Why Mr. Anderson? Why?

1090
01:48:54,693 --> 01:48:55,563
Why?

1091
01:48:57,393 --> 01:48:58,853
Why do you do it?

1092
01:48:59,503 --> 01:49:01,403
Why? Why get up?

1093
01:49:01,593 --> 01:49:04,153
Why keep fighting?

1094
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:10,233
Do you believe you're fighting for something? For more than your survival?

1095
01:49:10,554 --> 01:49:14,554
Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know?

1096
01:49:17,264 --> 01:49:19,134
Is it freedom or truth?

1097
01:49:19,214 --> 01:49:21,554
Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?

1098
01:49:21,754 --> 01:49:25,364
Illusions Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception.

1099
01:49:25,534 --> 01:49:30,264
Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify...

1100
01:49:30,305 --> 01:49:33,595
...an existance that is without meaning or purpose.

1101
01:49:33,745 --> 01:49:37,445
And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself.

1102
01:49:37,565 --> 01:49:43,125
Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love.

1103
01:49:46,156 --> 01:49:48,186
You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson.

1104
01:49:48,256 --> 01:49:49,596
You must know it by now!

1105
01:49:49,676 --> 01:49:52,866
You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting!

1106
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:56,826
Why Mr. Anderson?

1107
01:49:56,906 --> 01:50:00,046
Why? Why do you persist?

1108
01:50:02,186 --> 01:50:04,756
Because I choose to.

1109
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,040
This is my world!

1110
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,410
My world!

1111
01:51:37,012 --> 01:51:38,142
Wait.

1112
01:51:38,962 --> 01:51:41,242
I've seen this.

1113
01:51:42,252 --> 01:51:45,122
This is it, this is the end.

1114
01:51:46,442 --> 01:51:47,762
Yes.

1115
01:51:47,822 --> 01:51:51,042
You were laying right there, just like that.

1116
01:51:51,273 --> 01:51:55,403
And I... I stand here, right here.

1117
01:51:55,423 --> 01:51:58,233
I'm... I'm supposed to say something.

1118
01:51:58,873 --> 01:52:00,653
I say...

1119
01:52:00,943 --> 01:52:04,983
Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.

1120
01:52:13,054 --> 01:52:14,014
What?

1121
01:52:14,704 --> 01:52:17,214
What did I just say?

1122
01:52:22,234 --> 01:52:23,074
No.

1123
01:52:23,264 --> 01:52:26,444
No, this isn't right, this can't be right.

1124
01:52:33,245 --> 01:52:34,985
Get away from me!

1125
01:52:35,235 --> 01:52:37,035
What are you afraid of?

1126
01:52:37,295 --> 01:52:39,205
It's a trick!

1127
01:52:39,515 --> 01:52:41,455
You were right, Smith.

1128
01:52:42,685 --> 01:52:45,485
You were always right.

1129
01:52:47,776 --> 01:52:50,336
It was inevitable.

1130
01:53:20,968 --> 01:53:23,728
Is it over?

1131
01:53:53,919 --> 01:53:55,799
Oh, no, no, no.

1132
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:58,500
No, it's not fair.

1133
01:54:51,853 --> 01:54:54,353
It is done.

1134
01:55:26,635 --> 01:55:28,495
It doesn't make sense.

1135
01:55:32,745 --> 01:55:34,345
He did it.

1136
01:55:35,395 --> 01:55:37,125
He saved us.

1137
01:55:37,825 --> 01:55:38,895
He saved us.

1138
01:55:40,725 --> 01:55:43,265
He did it! He did it!

1139
01:55:43,916 --> 01:55:44,726
He did it!

1140
01:55:44,796 --> 01:55:46,406
He did it! It's over!

1141
01:55:47,056 --> 01:55:47,636
It's over! He did it!

1142
01:55:47,826 --> 01:55:49,356
He did it! What is it? What happened?

1143
01:55:49,426 --> 01:55:50,236
Sir...

1144
01:55:50,346 --> 01:55:51,726
He did it, Sir! Neo! He did it!

1145
01:55:51,806 --> 01:55:53,366
Did what? He ended the war!

1146
01:55:53,406 --> 01:55:54,636
The machines are gone!!

1147
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,636
The war is over, Sir! The war is over!

1148
01:56:00,537 --> 01:56:01,527
Zion!

1149
01:56:02,467 --> 01:56:05,527
Zion! It's over!

1150
01:56:06,067 --> 01:56:07,517
It's over!

1151
01:56:07,857 --> 01:56:09,617
The war is over!

1152
01:56:10,727 --> 01:56:12,577
The war is over!

1153
01:56:34,979 --> 01:56:37,809
I have imagined this moment...

1154
01:56:38,339 --> 01:56:40,619
...for so long.

1155
01:56:43,909 --> 01:56:46,909
Is this real?

1156
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,240
Neo, wherever you are.

1157
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,070
Thank you.

1158
01:57:45,032 --> 01:57:46,222
Good morning.

1159
01:58:07,464 --> 01:58:08,934
Well, now...

1160
01:58:09,044 --> 01:58:11,634
...ain't this a surprise?

1161
01:58:11,724 --> 01:58:14,104
You played a very dangerous game.

1162
01:58:14,124 --> 01:58:16,334
Change always is.

1163
01:58:16,384 --> 01:58:20,904
Just how long do you think this peace is going to last?

1164
01:58:21,274 --> 01:58:24,584
As long as it can.

1165
01:58:27,105 --> 01:58:29,425
What about the others?

1166
01:58:30,685 --> 01:58:32,155
What others?

1167
01:58:32,185 --> 01:58:34,435
The ones that want out.

1168
01:58:34,745 --> 01:58:37,545
Obviously they will be freed.

1169
01:58:37,645 --> 01:58:39,815
I have your word?

1170
01:58:39,896 --> 01:58:41,196
What do you think I am?

1171
01:58:41,216 --> 01:58:42,186
Human?

1172
01:58:56,966 --> 01:58:58,346
Oracle!

1173
01:59:05,447 --> 01:59:10,127
We were afraid we might not find you. Everything's okay now.

1174
01:59:10,997 --> 01:59:15,797
Look! Look! Just look at that!

1175
01:59:16,378 --> 01:59:18,598
Beautiful!

1176
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:24,308
Did you do that? For Neo.

1177
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:27,368
That's nice!

1178
01:59:27,398 --> 01:59:29,378
I know he'd love it.

1179
01:59:29,718 --> 01:59:32,288
Will we ever see him again?

1180
01:59:32,388 --> 01:59:35,028
I suspect so.

1181
01:59:35,249 --> 01:59:37,489
Someday.

1182
01:59:41,799 --> 01:59:43,759
Did you always know?

1183
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:46,559
Oh, no. No I didn't.

1184
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,879
But I believed.

1185
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,530
I believed.
