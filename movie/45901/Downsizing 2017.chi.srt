10
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,210
谢谢大家 谢谢佩雷拉博士
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Pereira.

11
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,390
75年前 内莉·埃德瓦森夫人
Seventy-five years ago, Mrs. Nellie Edvardsen,

12
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,410
为了减轻一战期间
overcome with guilt by the fortune

13
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,060
她亡夫的家族通过制造芥子气
her late husband's family had amassed

14
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,920
来敛财的罪恶感
producing mustard gas during World War I,

15
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,080
成立了这家研究所
founded our institute

16
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,620
这样科学的奇迹
so that the wonders of science

17
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,890
就可以用来帮助人类
could instead be used to help mankind.

18
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,850
在20世纪50年代
In the 1950s,

19
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,870
研究所将人口过剩确定为
the institute identified over-population

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,860
人类最大的长期威胁
as mankind's single greatest long-term threat,

21
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,980
它是导致现如今所有灾难的原因--
the cause of all the catastrophes we are seeing today--

22
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,080
极端天气气候事件
extreme climate and weather events,

23
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,690
以及对食品安全和水安全的破坏性影响
and the devastating impact on food and water security.

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,830
在我们多年前设想的多种解决方案中
Among the many solutions we conceived so many years ago,

25
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,090
有一个...
one...

26
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,990
当时看起来非常艰巨
which seemed then so ambitious, so

27
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,280
超出我们能力范围的方案
out of our grasp

28
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
终于成功了
has finally borne fruit.

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,480
今天 我们很自豪地宣布
And today we are proud to unveil

30
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,410
我们坚信能够解决人类最大问题的
what we fervently believe to be the only practical,

31
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,710
唯一既实际又人道且具包容性的补救办法
humane and inclusive remedy to humanity's greatest problem.

32
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,040
我的同事
My colleague,

33
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,910
乔根·阿斯比恩森博士将会对他的发现做一个介绍
Dr. Jorgen Asbjornsen will now present his findings.

34
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,030
准备好了吗 博士?
Are you ready, doctor?

35
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,860
准备好了

41
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,380
佩雷拉博士 各位尊敬的同事
Dr. Pereira, esteemed colleagues.

42
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,350
五年前
Five years ago,

43
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,070
在前辈研究的基础上
building on the research of our predecessors at the institute,

44
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,060
我的团队和我发现了一种反应过程
my team and I discovered a process

45
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,040
通过这个过程 所有有机物质
by which all organic material can be reduced

46
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,980
可以在细胞级别减少约
at the cellular level by a ratio of approximately

47
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,500
2744比1的比例
2,744 to one.

48
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,710
一个1米8的大男人通过这个反应过程
Such a process converts a man of 1.8 meters

49
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,020
可以缩小到12.9厘米
to just 12.9 centimeters.

50
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,700
大量的动植物
A wide array of flora and fauna

51
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,850
被运用到这个实验中
were subjected in this process

52
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,090
除了一些鱼类和贝类
and with the exception of some fish and shellfish,

53
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,640
完全没有发现任何负面作用
absolutely no side effects were detected.

54
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,780
灯光
Please, lights.

55
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,330
过程的安全性得到确保之后
Once the safety of the procedure was confirmed,

56
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,690
36位勇敢的志愿者
thirty-six brave volunteers

57
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
加上我和我的妻子安妮·海伦
joined my wife Anne-Helene and me

58
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,910
成为首批进行细胞缩小术的人类
as the very first humans to undergo cellular reduction.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,100
整个过程很快且无痛苦
The process is short and painless,

60
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,230
略有些轻微的
with only the mild discomfort of removal

61
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,540
牙齿和肢体更换的不适感
and replacement of dental and other prosthetics.

62
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,860
受试者处于轻度睡眠状态
The subjects are placed under light sedation,

63
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,370
通过短暂的休息
and after a brief rest,

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,390
在1到2个小时内可完全恢复
fully recover within an hour or two.

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,870
一旦完成 我们的小村庄
Once completed, our little village,

66
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,150
只有77平方米
just seven meters by eleven meters,

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,000
被放置在透气的保护壳中
was place inside a gas-permeable enclosure

68
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,710
以免我们受到天气
designed to protect us from the hazards of weather,

69
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,570
动物和昆虫的伤害
animals and insects.

70
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,590
就这样 我们开始共同生活在
Thus we set about to live together

71
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,580
世界上第一个自给自足
in the world's very first self-sustaining

72
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,580
的小型社区里
community of the small.

73
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,040
在我的手中
I hold here in my hand

74
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,610
是过去4年36个人产生的
all of the uncompostable waste

75
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,480
所有不可分解的垃圾
produced by 36 people over four years.

76
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,020
在今天下午的会议上
In this afternoon's session,

77
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,450
我们将会针对在两三百年内使世界由大变小这个议题
we will outline our proposal for a two to three-hundred year transition

78
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,750
概述我们的方案
for the world to transform from big into small.

79
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,470
但现在
But for now,

80
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,990
我想介绍一群非常特殊的人
I'd like you all to meet some very special people.

81
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,490
干得好!
Bravo!

82
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,940
太棒了!
Yes!

83
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,190
好样的!
Bravo!

84
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,910
请看 这位是小罗尼 Nesthritt
And look, there is little Ronnie Nesthritt,

85
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,710
出生的第一个微型宝宝
the first small baby ever born.

86
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,160
以及他的小妹妹乌莉卡
And his new little sister Ulrikke.

87
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,740
...爱德华森研究所
of the Edvardsen Institute,

88
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,360
现在只有10厘米高 重约18克
himself now only ten centimeters tall and weighing just 18 grams,

89
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,440
显示了这项发现的可行性
explained the rationale behind the invention.

90
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,310
天呐!太疯狂了 简直太疯狂了!
Wow! That is wild, isn't it? Just wild.

91
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,720
什么事 霍莉
Say, Holly,

92
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,350
你继续去接外卖单 谢谢
you can go ahead and put the take-out order in, thanks.

93
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,100
-是你吗? -是的
-Is that you? -Yeah.

94
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,680
饿了吗?
You hungry?

95
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,510
我一个小时前吃过了
I ate about an hour ago.

96
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,460
我不知道你要来
I didn't know when you were coming.

97
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,140
你知道我要带些吃的来
You knew I was bringing food.

98
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,870
我还特地给你打了电话
I called you and asked you specifically.

99
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,820
-我刚吃了芝麻鸡 -然而你还是吃过了
-I just had sesame chicken. -And then you go and eat.

100
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,190
我还是很饿
I'm still hungry.

101
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,270
"尖叫预谋"
screams premeditation.

102
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,000
"人们尚不了解他的新书"
Yet relatively few people knew about his new book.

103
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,150
你今天看新闻了吗?
Did you see the news today?

104
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,320
那个瑞典微型人
About the little Swedish man?

105
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,720
挪威人
Norwegian.

106
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,280
看了 海伦打电话过来让我看的
Yeah, Helen called to tell me to turn on the TV.

107
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,120
有什么他们不敢想的呢
What won't they think of next.

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,230
难以置信 自登月之后最大的一件事 并且更大
Unbelievable. Biggest thing since landing on the moon. Bigger.

109
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,940
唔
Mm.

110
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,420
我不懂
I don't get it.

111
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,030
为什么会有人愿意对自己这样做呢
Why would anybody want to do that to himself?

112
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,720
他们能把人类缩小
They can shrink people down,

113
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,850
飞向火星
fly to mars,

114
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,670
但他们却不能治愈我的纤维肌痛?
and they can't cure my fibromyalgia?

115
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,380
即使明天世界末日了
And all this fuss about the environment

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
还在对环境问题大题小做
though the world's gonna end tomorrow.

117
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,010
我很痛苦
I'm in pain.

118
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,200
几乎不能呼吸
I can't breathe.

119
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,900
那难道不重要吗?
Doesn't that matter?

120
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,340
很多人都有病痛 妈妈
Lots of people are in pain, Mom.

121
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,020
各种各样的病痛
In all sorts of ways.

122
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,220
你好 卡尔曼
Hola Carmen.

123
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,750
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

124
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,150
用力 用力
Strong, strong.

125
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,250
和往常差不多还是...
Is it usually or more like...

126
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,530
有点刺痛
tingling?

127
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,710
-更像刺痛 -刺痛 明白了
-More like tingling. -Tingling. Okay.

128
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,100
缩小人类技术就像一辆失控的列车
This downsizing thing is simply runaway train technology

129
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
对世界经济
that's having a devastating impact

130
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,850
有破坏性的影响
on our world economy.

131
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,280
我们已经损失了数十亿的消费支出
We're losing billions of dollars in consumer spending already.

132
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,920
对建筑业 汽车行业 房地产和国防
It's hurting us in construction,

133
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,350
造成了损失
automobile, housing, and defense.

134
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,210
政治方面尤其如此
And then of course, when we get to politics,

135
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,400
-以色列人缩小巴勒斯坦人 -荣恩...
-Israelis shrinking Palestinians, -Ron...

136
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,670
非洲独裁者
African dictators

137
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,690
-缩小敌对族群 -荣恩 听着 荣恩
-shrinking rival ethnic groups. -Ron. Look, Ron.

138
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,170
社会的变革
In any major transformation of society,

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,040
伴随着成长的阵痛吗?
are there serious growing pains?

140
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,970
当然
Sure.

141
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,990
但就目前的数量和体积
But at current mass and volume,

142
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,590
人类生命在地球上是不可延续的
human life on Earth is unsustainable.

143
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,910
他说的有点道理
You know, that one guy makes a good point.

144
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
和我同一街道的一户人家为了变小而刚搬走
This family on my block just moved away to get small,

145
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,370
他们的房子就矗立在那儿
now their house is just sittin' there.

146
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,160
他们的行为让所有人的价值观受到了冲击
Makin' everybody's values take a dive is what they're doin'.

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,570
就在我试着筹钱的时候
Just when I'm tryin' to refinance.

148
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,180
马勒尼觉得我应该接受这项手术来减肥
Marlene thinks I should do it just to lose the weight.

149
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,860
兄弟 你和我都需要做
You and me both, buddy.

150
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,000
嘿 dee 打包好了吗
Hey, Dee, is that take-out order about ready?

151
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,820
嘿 亲爱的 我带了吃的
Hey, honey, I brought food.

152
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,650
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

153
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,560
怎么了?
What's wrong?

154
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,910
我有点头疼
I have a splitting headache.

155
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,310
店里超级忙
The store was super busy and

156
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,870
卡尔拉是个该死的婊子
Carla was a total bitch on wheels.

157
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,540
我觉得我要吐了
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

158
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,600
让我帮你按摩按摩脖子
Here, wait, let me do the neck thing.

159
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,340
好啊 按摩一下
Yeah, do the little neck thing.

160
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,480
嗯
Mm.

161
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,080
放轻松 宝贝
Just relax, honey.

162
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,910
把重量都放我手上
Let me take all the weight.

163
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,990
这是一个有着大壁炉
Okay, here's the beautiful formal living room

164
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,740
装修精美的客厅
with the wonderful fireplace.

165
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,510
到这里来 我们有
And come around here, we have

166
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,200
一个有宽阔早餐区的厨房
a nice big breakfast area for the kitchen.

167
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,050
很大的用餐空间
Big eating area.

168
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,380
这个厨房非常棒
And this kitchen is just a complete wow.

169
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,350
不 这房子很棒 只是...
No, it's awesome. Just...

170
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,550
或许我们可以再看看本森那栋
maybe we should look again at that place in Benson.

171
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,840
来吧 让我们看完剩下的
Come on, let's just check out the rest.

172
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,600
这里很棒
This is great in here,

173
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,040
双烤箱 六口燃气灶
double oven, six burner gas stove.

174
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,890
这边还有一个食品储藏室
It's got this wonderful butler's pantry over here.

175
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,710
-噢 嘿 肖恩 -噢 嘿 保罗 你好吗?
-Oh, hey, Sean. -Oh, hey, Paul, how you doin'?

176
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,600
不错
Good.

177
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,040
我看起来胖吗?
Do I look fat?

178
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,430
不 你看着很帅
No, you look very handsome.

179
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,920
麻醉科 嗯?
Anesthesiology, huh?

180
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,140
我妻子说我能不用药物使人入睡 所以
My wife says I put people to sleep even without the drugs, so.

181
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,620
很奇怪你居然醒着
Surprised you're still awake.

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,700
他每周要把这个笑话讲两次
He uses that joke like twice a week.

183
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
你研究什么领域 保罗?
What's your field, Paul?

184
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,890
呃 职业治疗
Uh, occupational therapy.

185
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,620
不错
Okay.

186
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,630
哦 类似职业咨询
Oh, like-like career counseling?

187
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,680
呃 不是 就是物理疗法
Uh, no, it's just like physical therapy

188
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,520
但专注于工伤和恢复领域
but focused on workplace injuries and rehab,

189
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,360
肢体机械性劳损 下背部等等
repetitive stress, lower back, that sort of thing.

190
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,200
有许多肩部方面的问题
A lot of shoulder problems.

191
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,560
我公司在奥马哈牛排店上面
I-I'm in-house over at Omaha Steaks.

192
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,990
-他有很多文书工作要做 -是的 嗯...
-He does a lot of paperwork. -Yeah, well...

193
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
我时不时自己也会得腕管综合症
I get a little carpal tunnel of my own from time to time.

194
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,100
我有同感
Tell me about it.

195
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,690
如今的药品就是用来收拾烂摊子的
Medicine these days is all about covering your ass.

196
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,540
但你不是在林肯医院工作吗?
But weren't you pre-med down in Lincoln?

197
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,030
记性真好 不错 我呆了两年
Good memory, yeah. I put in two years

198
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,560
但我妈妈病得非常严重
uh, then my mom got real sick

199
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,790
所以我搬回奥马哈来照顾她
so I moved back to Omaha to take care of her.

200
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,940
实际上我想成为一名外科医生
I wanted to be a surgeon, actually.

201
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,340
说不定我们会一起工作
You know, we might've ended up working together.

202
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,920
你说不定会是我的麻醉师
I...you could've been my anesthesiologist.

203
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,450
-听起来不错 -对的
-How 'bout that? -Yeah.

204
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,550
哦 天呐!不可能
Oh, my God! No way.

205
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,690
我看到她向这桌走来
? I saw her heading to the table ?

206
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,310
步伐活像一只黑猫
? Like a tall walking big black cat ?

207
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,440
戴夫？
Dave?

208
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,020
是戴夫 戴夫·约翰逊
It's Dave, Dave Johnson.

209
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,310
以及卡罗!
And Carol!

210
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,190
能搭把手吗?
Can I have a hand?

211
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,730
我...我听说他要来
I-I heard he was coming.

212
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,800
真没想到
I had no idea.

213
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,580
我从没想过他会把自己变小
He never struck me as the kind of guy who'd go get small.

214
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,950
哇喔!
Wow!

215
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,690
有个人夺门而出 桌椅乱飞
A-jumping out of doors and tables

216
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,920
不知道是谁开始射击?
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

217
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,140
然后检察官拷了我的左手?
Well the DA was pumping my left hand

218
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,640
但她牵着我的右手
Ah, but she was a-holding my right

219
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,530
-大家好! -你们好!
-Hey, everybody! -Hi!

220
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,250
-嘿 -你好
-Hey. -Hi.

221
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,800
希望我们没有打扰你们
Hope we're not intruding.

222
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,730
-没有 -没有 戴夫
-No. -No, Dave.

223
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,360
嘿 安迪
Hey, Andy?

224
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,490
你能帮卡罗倒一杯 呃...
Could you get Carol a, uh...

225
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,870
琴汤尼
Uh, gin and tonic.

226
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,370
一杯琴汤尼
A gin and tonic.

227
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,720
加酸橙
With lime.

228
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,030
加酸橙
With lime.

229
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,260
事实上 我们一开始没打算来
Well, actually, we weren't planning on coming at all at first.

230
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,630
但 你懂的 我们开始收到很多邮件
But then, you know, we started getting all the e-mails.

231
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,190
再加上我妹妹进行了肿瘤切除手术
Plus my sister was having a lump removed.

232
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,290
感谢上帝 她恢复得很好
I mean, she's-she's fine, thank God.

233
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,110
但我还是得来看看她
But I still needed to see her.

234
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,520
旅行怎么样?
So, what's traveling like?

235
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,550
你们是怎么从新墨西哥州过来的?
How'd you guys get up here from New Mexico?

236
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,190
天 非常棒
Oh, gosh, it's great.

237
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,100
现在的航班对微型人越来越友好了
Yeah, the airlines are getting more and more small-friendly.

238
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,050
座位都在头等舱
All the seats are first-class...

239
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,510
在佛罗里达州待了几年后 我们搬到了拉斯维加斯
So after a couple of years in Florida, we moved out to Vegas.

240
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,340
然后...
And that...

241
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,240
我记得那是我们最后一次聊天吧
Yeah, I think that's the last time we talked.

242
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,170
是的 拉斯维加斯
Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't

243
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,120
不适合我
such a good choice for me, as it turns out.

244
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,710
我在那染上了一些坏习惯
Got into some real bad habits.

245
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,110
差不多跌到人生谷底了
Pretty much hit rock bottom.

246
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,640
我跟你讲 其他的女人肯定会逃得远远的
Tell ya, any other woman would've run for the hills.

247
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,170
但卡罗 她是一个圣人
Carol, man, she's a saint.

248
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,460
她一直陪着我
She stuck with me.

249
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,510
但我需要从头开始
But I really had to come clean about everything.

250
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,870
重新来过
I-I mean everything.

251
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,620
你懂的 差不多这样
You know...almost.

252
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,930
所以 你就决定...
So, the decision to...

253
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,430
是的 就是这样
Well, that's the thing.

254
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,010
我们都需要做出改变
We both needed the change.

255
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,370
按下重置键 从头开始
Hit the reset button. Start all over.

256
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,120
嗯 知道自己做出贡献的感觉
Well, and plus, it must feel good to know

257
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,410
一定很棒
you're really making a difference.

258
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,590
你指那些拯救地球的胡话?
You mean all that crap about saving the planet?

259
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,650
对
Yeah.

260
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,250
缩小身体就是自救
Downsizing is about saving yourself.

261
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,240
它减轻了压力
I-It takes the pressure right off.

262
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,460
特别是资金压力
Especially money pressure.

263
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,260
我不像我其他家人那样雄心勃勃
I'm just not driven and ambitious like the rest of my family.

264
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,320
卡罗和我现在活得像皇室一样
And now, Carol and I, we live like kings.

265
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,470
我还是住在从小长大的房子里
I'm still living in the same house I grew up in.

266
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,050
奥德丽特别希望我们搬家
I mean, Audrey's dying for us to move

267
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,660
但是我们非常拮据
but we're really strapped.

268
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,950
我的意思是 我才还清我的学生贷款
I mean, shit, I just finished paying off my student loans.

269
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,000
这个嘛
Yeah, well...

270
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,070
听着 如果你考虑清楚了
Listen, if you ever start thinkin' about it seriously,

271
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,250
这是我的一点建议 呃...
here's my two cents, uh...

272
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,080
那里有很多小型社区
There's a lot of small communities croppin' up out there, but

273
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
但别搞错
don't mess around.

274
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,730
悠闲境才是你真正想去的社区
Leisureland's where you wanna be.

275
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,900
最好的房子 最好的设备 最好的医生
Best houses, best appliances, best doctors.

276
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,670
有精彩绝伦的演唱会巡演
They book all the big concert tours.

277
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,940
有让人垂涎欲滴的餐厅
They got all the great restaurants.

278
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,100
孩子们爱死了芝士蛋糕
The kids love Cheesecake Factory.

279
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,680
而悠闲境里有三家芝士蛋糕工厂
And Leisureland's got three of 'em.

280
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,670
我说这些不是为了向你推销
And hey, I'm not just saying all this for the referral credit.

281
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,500
别误会
Just so you know.

282
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,060
我喜欢小卡罗 她现在过得非常好
I liked little Carol. She's got a lot on the ball.

283
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,010
她在读她一直想读的书
She's reading books she always wanted to read.

284
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,550
她会说意大利语
She's taking Italian.

285
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,000
她过得从没这么健康过
And she's never been fitter.

286
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,700
他们看起来确实非常开心
Well, they sure seem happy.

287
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,270
戴夫说他打鼓打得越来越好了
Dave says he's getting pretty good on the drums.

288
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,300
明年他们将带孩子
Next year, they're taking the kids out of school

289
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,000
在托斯卡纳的姐妹城市里住上六个月
to spend six months at a sister city in Tuscany.

290
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,360
烹饪课 瑜伽 品酒会
Cooking classes, yoga, wine-tasting,

291
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,740
应有尽有
the whole nine yards.

292
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,040
你好 萨弗 奥德丽 我是米洛
Hey, Saf, Audrey, it's Milo.

293
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,400
有个坏消息
Bad news.

294
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,400
你在银行的抵押贷款被拒绝了
Your mortgage application at First National bounced back.

295
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,030
保险商觉得收入与负债比不太合理--
The underwriter didn't like the income to debt ratios--

296
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,410
比例有点过大了
they're a little excessive.

297
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,770
我不确定你能不能想想办法
I-I don't know if you can come up with

298
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
降低10%到15%
another ten-fifteen percent down.

299
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,810
如果你可以 修改一下...
If you could, maybe goose it up a little bit...

300
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,080
我们很快就会知道它适不适合我们了
And then we'll be able to tell right away if it's for us or not.

301
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,320
对 别浪费时间了
Yeah, so let's not waste a lot of time.

302
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,160
要是我们到圣达菲到早了 我们还可以做个按摩
Maybe if we get to Santa Fe early, we can get a massage.

303
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,620
听起来不错
Sounds good to me.

304
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,400
相拥着跳舞
Out together dancin' cheek to cheek

305
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,600
天堂
Heaven

306
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,060
我宛如置身天堂
I'm in heaven

307
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,150
这一周所有的关心
And the cares that hung around me

308
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,740
都在我左右?
through the week

309
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,250
就如同不再眷顾赌徒的幸运女神消失了一样
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

310
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:04,660
当我们一起脸贴着脸跳舞时
When we're out together dancin' cheek to cheek

311
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,860
欢迎大家
Welcome, everybody!

312
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,700
我是杰夫·罗诺斯基 高级产品专家
I'm Jeff Lonowsky, Senior Product Specialist

313
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,250
悠闲境的产权拥有者
and happy homeowner here at Leisureland Estates.

314
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,630
你们玩得开心吗?
You havin' a good time?

315
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,560
-是的 -是的
-Yeah. -Yeah.

316
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,410
加把劲 大家 你们可比我大多了
Come on, guys, you're a heck of a lot bigger than I am.

317
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,070
大声点! 你们玩得开心吗?
Make some noise! Are you havin' a good time?

318
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,910
-开心! -开心!
-Yeah! -Yeah!

319
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,430
-开心! -开心!
-Yeah! -Yeah!

320
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,250
这还差不多
That's more like it.

321
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,470
你们觉得我这地方怎么样?
So, what do you think of my place?

322
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,320
很漂亮吧?
Pretty nifty, huh?

323
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,600
这是我梦想中的房子
It's the house of my dreams.

324
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,100
哎 我会说这是所有人梦想的房子
Heck, I'd say this is the house of anybody's dreams.

325
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,790
为什么呢? 以前平庸如我的人得工作20年
Why, an average guy like me would have to work twenty,

326
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,050
30年 甚至40年才买得起这样
thirty, maybe forty years to afford a place like this,

327
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,020
的房子
if ever.

328
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,010
来看看里面有什么
And just wait till you see what's inside.

329
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,780
噢
Oh.

330
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,550
杰夫?
Jeff?

331
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,700
你别再未经我允许就请客人来
You've gotta stop inviting guests over without telling me.

332
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,830
噢 对不起 劳拉 我只是在--
Oh, sorry, Laura. I was only--

333
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,900
我刚忙完 准备泡个澡放松一下呢
I mean, I finally just got in the tub to relax after such a busy day.

334
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,330
忙了些什么呢 亲爱的?
Busy doing what, sweetheart?

335
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,870
噢 好多事情
Oh, no end of things.

336
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,400
我先是上了一堂网球课 然后做了个按摩
First I took a tennis lesson and had a massage.

337
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,140
不错
Nice.

338
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,440
然后和姐妹们吃了顿美味的午餐
And then after a gourmet lunch with the girls,

339
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,030
嗯 我们控制不住
well, we couldn't help ourselves

340
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,010
去逛了市中心那家新的罗格特珠宝店
so we popped into that new Loget's jewelry store downtown.

341
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,200
啊哦 罗格特的 花了我多少?
Uh-oh, Loget's. What's than gonna cost me?

342
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,580
安静 杰夫 没花多少
Now, Jeff, you hush. I was really good.

343
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,570
只是一条钻石手镯
Just another diamond bracelet.

344
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,340
只有一条钻石手镯? 听起来可一点都不像你
Just a diamond bracelet? That doesn't sound like you.

345
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,310
猜对了 我不想拆了一整套首饰
You're right, I don't like to break up a set.

346
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,990
所以我还买了配套的钻石耳环
So, I got matching diamond earrings

347
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,270
以及配套的钻石项链
and a matching diamond necklace.

348
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,520
都是互相不冲突的材料 而且用铂金镶嵌
All conflict-free, and set in platinum.

349
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,910
多少钱 劳拉
How much, Laura?
多少钱 劳拉?
How much, Laura?

350
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,480
哦 但是杰夫 我戴着这么好看 你应该看
Oh, but Jeff, they look so good on me, and you should see--
噢 杰夫 我戴着它们非常漂亮 你应该看看--
Oh, but Jeff, they look so good on me, and you should see--

351
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,910
多少钱 劳拉？
How much, Laura?

352
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,550
- 唉 杰夫  - 我说多少钱
-Well, Jeff... -I said how much?

353
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,790
八十三美金
Eighty-three dollars.

354
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,470
八十三美金 你疯了吗
Eighty-three dollars? Are you crazy?

355
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,510
那是我们整整两个月的食物预算啊
Why, that's practically our food budget for two whole months!

356
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,110
总体来看的话 如果你们卖掉现在的房子
Putting it all together, if you liquidate your current home,

357
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,000
车 和其他财产
cars and other assets,

358
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,950
买一所至尊级房产
and purchase a Regency-level estate--

359
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,140
记住了那可是等同1100平米的房子
remember that's a 12,000 square foot equivalent home

360
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,990
建在等同6000平米的庄园上 基价在六万三千美元
on a 1.5 acre equivalent lot-- at a base price of $63,000.

361
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,940
之后购买健康和健身套
Then the Health and Fitness package--

362
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,170
那个4500美金 你可得买这个
that's $4,500, you're gonna wanna get that.

363
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,430
包括健身房 泳池 桑拿 蒸汽浴室 热浴缸 和网球场
It's gym, pool, sauna, steam, hot tub, and a tennis court.

364
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,170
还有两个成人的医疗程序费
Then the medical procedures for two adults.

365
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,750
那是一万五千美金
That's $15,000.

366
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,180
但保险一点都不包括这些吗
But does insurance cover any of that?

367
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,730
不 但在至尊级
No, but at the Regency

368
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,460
你可以取得大幅折扣
level you qualify of a substantial discount.

369
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,450
而且别忘了联邦税收抵免
And don't forget the federal tax credit.

370
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,420
- 对 对  - 对吧
-Right, right. -Right?

371
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,070
那 看一下你们目前的债务
So, taking a look at your current debt,

372
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,710
你们的养老金和其余存款
you retirement and your other savings,

373
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,860
你们拥有十五万二千美金资产
you are at $152,000 in equity.

374
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,200
两位 这可是个非常舒服的数
People, that is a very comfortable number.

375
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,850
舒服 这些钱听起来根本不够啊
Comfortable‘? That doesn't sound like nearly enough.

376
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,950
- 嗯  - 不是的
-Yeah. -Well, no.

377
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,860
看 你必须看看这行 奥黛丽
See, you have to look at this column, Audrey.

378
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,070
等同财产
Equivalent value.

379
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,580
你们可完全处于蓝筹区里
You're solidly inside the Blue Chip zone.

380
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:53,870
在悠闲境里面你们的十五万两千美金等价为一千两百五十万
In Leisureland your $152,000 translates to $12.5 million--

381
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,930
可供生活享受
to live on, for life.

382
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,440
我是说 真的
I mean, come on!

383
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,980
- 哦  - 嗯
-Oh. -Well.

384
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,410
等等 如果这么好的话
Hold on, if this is such a good thing,

385
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,010
为什么你没去变小
how come you haven't done it?

386
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,590
我毫不犹豫就会这么做
I would do it in a heartbeat

387
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,330
但我丈夫做了髋关节手术
but my husband had a hip replacement

388
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,760
所以他不能做
so he's ineligible.

389
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,050
那 你们怎么看
So, what do you think?

390
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,270
至尊级是你们的第一选择吗
Would the Regency level be your first choice?

391
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,700
还是我应该给你们介绍更奢侈一点的选择
Or should should I show you something a little more deluxe?

392
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,290
宝贝 你去看着选吧
Honey, why don't you just go ahead and pick.

393
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,710
我只想让你开心
I just want you to be happy.

394
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,040
这是个好丈夫
That's a good husband.

395
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,690
看看这个
Take a look at this.

396
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,260
嘿 这个热狗机多少钱
Hey, how much for the hotdog cooker?

397
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,530
4美元
Four dollars.

398
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,470
我能出一美元
I'll give you a dollar.

399
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,630
成交
Sold.

400
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,160
继续好好锻炼 别犯懒 看
Keep up with the exercises. Don't get lazy. Look.

401
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,010
我给你整理好了
I laminated it for you,

402
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,130
这样你真的没有理由不做了
so you literally have no excuse not to do it.

403
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,540
好 谢谢 保罗 太谢谢了
Okay, thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

404
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,290
没事
You bet.

405
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,860
或许有一天我和我妻子也会变小
Maybe someday me and my wife will get small

406
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
然后我们就去看你们
and we'll come down and see ya.

407
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,140
嗯 那就太好了 但同时...
Well, I'd love that. But in the meantime...

408
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,440
- 好吗  - 好的
-Okay? -All right.

409
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,410
- 每晚锻炼15分钟就好  - 好的
-Just 15 minutes every night. -Okay.

410
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,830
- 会改变你的生活的  - 谢了 保罗
-It'll change your life. -Thanks, Paul.

411
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,810
再见 戴夫
See ya, Dave.

412
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,980
我们在这里 因为保罗·萨弗拉尼克

414
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,340
即将搬去悠闲境 与他道别
farewell as he moves on to Leisureland.

415
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,260
而且我们只求他最好 别无所求

416
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,980
祝你和奥德蕾好运

你们就没考虑过宝藏岛他家吗
And you guys didn't consider Treasure Island

420
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,080
就在棕榈沙漠那边
out in Palm Desert?

421
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,740
嗯 我们去看过了 但
Well, we checked it out, but

422
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,470
我是说 我觉得不错
I mean, I liked it all right.

423
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,670
但奥德蕾觉得他们的设施有点差
But Audrey thought they were a little stingy with the amenities.

424
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,800
我是说 尤其是看在他们每月
I mean, especially given what they're charging

425
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,240
收那么多维护费的份上
in monthly maintenance.

426
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,820
而我就转向保罗说"好 你赢了"
And I just turned to Paul and said, "Okay, you win."

430
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,960
听着 又不是我们就要死了 好吗
Well, look, it's not like we're dying, okay?

431
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,290
我们只是要搬家
We're just relocating.

432
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,120
我们会每年至少回来一次的 或许更频繁呢
And we'll be back at least once a year. Maybe more.

433
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
- 嗨 爸  - 甜心

Yeah, well, sorry your mom couldn't bring herself to come.

435
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,710
但她转达她的爱
But she sends her love

436
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,490
而且我们明天下午在家里等你

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,920
- 很高兴你能过来 拉里  - 嘿 保罗

439
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,310

442
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,280
我希望妈别这么不能接受
I wish Mom weren't taking it so hard.

443
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,510
嗯 你了解你妈
Well, you know your mother.

444
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,830
老实说 我一开始也有点怀疑
Frankly, I was a little skeptical about it myself at first.

445
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,700
但 你记得杰瑞 Gross吗
Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

446
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,060
嗯 我那天给他打了个电话
Well, I called him the other day.

447
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,040
他和Bev退休之后
He and Bev retired down there.

448
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,790
做了你们这些孩子做的这个缩小
Did the whole shrinking thing that you kids are doing.

449
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,870
他说他们过的很好 再好不过了
He says they're getting along just fine, never better.

450

他说他每天都觉得更年轻
He says he feels younger every day

451
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,710
还有一美元能买到一千美元的东西
and that a dollar buys a thousand dollars worth of stuff.

452
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,000
当然因为Bev要用的那些药他们需要这个
Of course they need that with all the medication Bev takes.

453
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,150
但 ... 嗯
But, uh... yeah.

454
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,930
你知道的 我能看到优点
You know, I... I see the appeal.

455
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,010
尤其是那里零犯罪 我一直和你妈说
Apparently there's zero crime, I keep telling your mother.

456
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,960
特别安全
It's very safe.

457
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,670
嗯 我们还是会担心
Yeah, we worry.

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,560
你觉得你们那么小
do you think if you're that small

465
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,590
你们还和我们剩下的正常大小的人
you should still have all the same rights as the rest of us

466
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,150
有相同的权利吗

你们有些人甚至连收入税都不缴

I bet you're hungry.

565
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,130

573
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,660
让我看看

We do have an Audrey Safranek scheduled for today

575
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,420
但看记录她还没有转到这里
but I don't show her transferred over yet.

576
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,040
她可能还在牙科那边吧 我会去看看的
She's probably just held up in dental. I'll go check.

577
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,390

Oh, Audrey, thank God. Where are you, honey?

583
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,370
别生我的气 求求你别生气
Don't be mad at me. Please don't be mad.

584
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,270
对我已经很艰难了
It's hard enough as it is.

585
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,800
什么很难 等等 你在说什么
What's hard? Wait, what are you talkin' about?

586
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,720
哦 保罗
Oh, Paul!

587
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,620
他们剃光了我的头
They shaved my head.

588
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,820
然后开始剃我的眉毛 我就想
And then they started shaving my eyebrows and I just thought,

589
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,930
"我这是在干什么"
"What am I doing?"

590
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,100
我不能离开我的家庭 我不能离开我的朋友
I can't leave my family. I can't leave my friends.

591
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,380
- 我很抱歉 保罗 我就是不能  - 你在哪
-And I'm sorry, Paul, I just can't. -Where are you?

592
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,990
你在机场吗
Are you at the airport?

593
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,690
别恨我
Don't hate me.

594
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,110
求你不要恨我
Please don't hate me.

595
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,690
好 好 放轻松 就
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Just

596
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,850
打辆出租车回来
get in a taxi and come back

597
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,450
然后我们再谈这事 好吗
and we'll talk about this, okay?

598
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,770
我们回奥马哈去之后我们再一起考虑这事
We'll go back to Omaha and we'll think this through together.

599
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,960
等等
Wait.

600
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,660
你不是要把我丢在这吧
You're not leaving me here.

601
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,450
你不能理解我的感受吗
Can't you understand how I feel?

602
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,820
我感觉很糟
I feel terrible.

603
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,190
我让你失望了 我觉得糟透了
I let you down, I feel awful.

604
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,860
但之后
But then-

605
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,220
之后我意识到我之所以这么做
then I realized I was just doing this

606
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,350
只是因为我想让你开心
because I w-I was trying to make you happy and

607
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,080
我应该多替我自己想想
I should've been thinking more about myself.

608
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,240
替你自己想想
Thinking about yourself?

609
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,030
替你自己想想
Thinking about yourself?!

610
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,440
你还没问过我怎么样了
You know, you haven't even asked me how I am!

611
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,520
别吼
Don't yell.

612
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,210
别吼我 不然我就挂了
Don't yell at me or I'll hang up.

613
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,580
你知道我今天经历了什么吗
Do you have any idea what I have been through today?

614
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,730
奥德丽 如果你现在不回来...
Audrey, if you don't come back here right now...

615
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,410
回来看你那么小吗
And see you all small?

616
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,120
我已经够沮丧的了
I'm upset enough already.

617
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,650
你沮丧
You're upset?

618
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,640
你沮丧
You're upset?

619
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,530
我他妈才是那个12厘米高的人
I'm the one who's five fucking inches tall!

620
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,100
嗯 我们很遗憾听到

622
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,680
萨弗拉尼克.

623
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,000
萨弗拉尼克.

624
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,490
嗯 先在这边打理好一切
Well, it's not a half-bad idea to scout things out

625
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,250
等她来也不完全是坏主意
get everything ready for her.

626
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,770
外膜会阻挡很多紫外线
The net blocks a lot of UV rays,

627
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,670
但还是得把帽子戴上
but you still might wanna put your hat on.

628
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,210
任何时候你想去什么地方
And anytime you wanna go somewhere,

629
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,280
你就随便上一辆这车
you just hop in one of these bad boys.

630
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,450
如果找不到的话
And if they're in short supply, well,

631
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,520
你总可以拼车的
you can always share.

632
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,410
拼车很有意思 我知道的 我这样遇到和一些超级有趣的人
It's fun to share. I know, I've met some super people that way.

633
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,590

Just super.

634
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,010
嗯 多壮观啊

世界上最大的室内滑雪设施

639
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,700
你懂的 相对而言

640
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,680
这边是切斯特湖
And over there is Lake Chester...

641
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,940
看上去熟悉吗

644

先生 这是你王国的钥匙

哦 他们在厨房放了常规物品
Oh, they uh, stocked the kitchen with standard items...

647
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,960
但我该警告你小心一件东西那就是乳制品
but one thing I should warn you about is the dairy--

648
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:53,020
要花一段时间你的胃才能
it takes a while for your stomach

649
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,270
适应牛奶和乳酪
to adjust to the milk and the cheese,

650
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,770
所以少吃点 说是和细菌有关
so go easy on it. Somethin' about the bacteria.

651
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,560
然后小心点热水
And be careful about the hot water.

652
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,650
是一个中心系统接入的 他们把水温提的过高了
It's on one central system and they got that cranked really high.

653
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,370
很惊讶他们还没吃到官司
Surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet.

654
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,180
哦 这话可不是我说的
Oh, but you didn't hear that from me.

655

00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,350
国土安全部的供述
from the Department of Homeland Security,

689
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,000
陈小姐宣称她因
Ms. Tran claims to have been jailed

690
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,450
政治与环境方面的运动被囚禁
for her political and environmental activism,

691
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,290
在一所越南监狱中
and was miniaturized against her will

692
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,100
随后被迫缩小
in a Vietnamese prison facility.

693
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,480
即全世界的镇压政府...
that repressive governments around the world...

694
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,530
那 我们还需要复核有关分割的任何条款吗
So, do we need to review any of the terms of the settlement?

695
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:44,660
不用了
No.

696
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,880
都很清楚
It's all pretty clear.

697
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,590
我真希望你接受她第一次的条件
I really wish you'd taken her first offer.

698
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,190
我知道
I know.

699
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:52,300
好了
All right, well.

700
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,160
请你往后退一点 不想伤到你
Just step back a little. Don't want you to get hurt.

701
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:13,860
呃
Um.

702
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,990
请尽可能写大一点
As large as you can, please.

703
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,440
这里天气是不错的
Nice weather down here.

704
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,760
奥马哈变得非常冷
Turned real cold back in Omaha.

705
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,290
是啊
Uh-huh.

706
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,140
刮寒风
Wind chill.

707
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,300
嘿 保罗
Hey, Paul.

708
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,020
伙计 谢谢你 你说得对
Thanks, man, you were right.

709
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,890
提高显示屏真的有用
Raising my monitor really did the trick.

710
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,380
我的脖子感觉好多了 胳膊也没有刺痛感了
My neck feels better, there's no more tingling in my arm.

711
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,080
要不是你我永远不会想到这有什么联系
I would've never made the connection.

712
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,140
太好了 我真的很高兴能帮上忙
That's great, I'm really glad I could help.

713
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,260
感谢致电Land’s End
Thank you for calling Land's End.

714
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,520
我是保罗 今天有什么可以帮你的？
My name is Paul, how can I help you today?

715
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,220
又见面了 保罗
Ciao, bello.

716
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,430
嗨 卡罗
Hi, Carol.

717
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,290
嘿 伙计
Hey, pal.

718
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,620
脸怎么这么长 嗯？
Why the long face? Huh?

719
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,050
看看你周围 生活多美好
Look around you, buddy. Life is good.

720
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,070
这是个错误 戴夫
I made a mistake, Dave.

721
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,430
我人生中最大的错误 我应该留在那儿
Biggest mistake of my life. Should've stayed where I was.

722
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,070
嘿 嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

723
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,150
我知道离婚会打击人的自尊心
Look, I know divorce can put a dent in anyone's self-esteem.

724
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,820
奥德丽对你做的事也太过分了
And what Audrey did to you was beyond the pale.

725
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,010
我是说 我讨厌她
I mean, I hate her.

726
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,660
我 我几乎不认识她
I-I barely know her.

727
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,020
你也许不恨她 但我恨死她了
You may not hate her, but I hate her guts.

728
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,730
你只需要重整旗鼓
You, you just gotta get back in the saddle, that's all.

729
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,930
嗯 也许未来的某一天吧
Ah, maybe someday.

730
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,870
如果你想听听我的建议
If you want my advice,

731
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:48,920
单身母亲应该适合你
single moms is the way to go.

732
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,680
她们把孩子什么的完全从人生中排除了
Yeah, they got the whole kid thing out of their system,

733
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,860
她们只想轰趴 寻欢作乐
and they just wanna party

734
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,930
不 我很好 我--
No, that's okay, I'm--

735
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:55,570
如果你不想建立情感联系
And if you don't want an emotional connection, which

736
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,520
也是可以理解的 你只需要 呃
understandable, you just uh

737
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,350
我们有各种各样的办法能让你在这玩得愉快
well, we have all sorts of ways you can have a good time down here.

738
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,660
不需要任何附加条件
No strings attached.

739
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,040
- 只要把帐记在旧信用卡上就好 - 不了 我很好
-Just put it on the old credit card. -No, I'm good.

740
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,750
- 真的吗 - 是的
-Really. -Okay, yeah.

741
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,020
实际上 我已经开始和某人约会了
In fact, I started seeing someone.

742
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,300
哦 真的吗？
Oh, yeah?

743
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,600
她其实也是个单身母亲
Single mom, actually.

744
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,920
嗯 现在我们说到一起了 真为你高兴
Mm-hmm, now we're talkin'. Good for you.

745
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,490
保罗 这个真好吃
Paul, this is so good.

746
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,860
谢谢
Thanks.

747
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,180
食谱上要求用山萝卜 但是
The recipe called for chervil, but

748
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,980
现在这个地方还没有山萝卜
you can't get chervil here yet.

749
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,110
- 所以 我用的小茴香 - 嗯
-So, I used dill. -Hm.

750
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,360
不管用的是什么 真的超级好吃
Well, whatever it is, it's super-yummy.

751
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,970
只是个小问题
It's the little things, you know?

752
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,770
我是说 这里除了没有鸟和昆虫
I mean, except for there being no birds or insects,

753
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,150
你会认为自己还在一个正常的世界
you'd think you're in the normal world

754
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,550
然后发生了一些事
and then somethin' happens

755
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,210
你才意识到这里并不是正常世界
and you realize we're not.

756
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,270
我是说 不是要用小茴香替代山萝卜的不正常
I mean, not that substituting dill for chervil

757
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,430
当然这不是个大事 但你懂我的意思
is that big a thing, but you know what I mean.

758
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,960
就像上个月
Like last month,

759
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,190
我父母来看我和乔纳
my parents came down to visit Jonah and me--

760
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,090
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,890
整个过程用的携带箱
and it's like this whole production

762
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,830
当然乔纳吓坏了
with the carrying boxes, and of course Jonah gets freaked out

763
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,010
以为祖父祖母变得那么巨大可怕
by Grandma and Grandpa being so huge and scary.

764
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,920
嗯
Mm.

765
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,380
一天晚上他们带我们去弗莱明吃晚饭
One night they took us out for dinner at Fleming's,

766
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,980
- 你知道的 很棒 - 嗯哼
-you know, real nice, -Mm-hmm.

767
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,350
乔纳和我坐在桌子上
and Jonah and are sitting on the table

768
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,850
那种特殊的椅子
in those special seats.

769
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,540
然后大的人们不停地看我们
And the big people wouldn't stop staring at us.

770
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,940
另外 这家餐馆吹嘘小人们有多么受欢迎
Plus, the restaurant brags about how small people are welcome,

771
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,840
然而他们却收取了高额的“最低费用”
and then they charge a huge minimum.

772
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,310
他们应该向大人们额外收费
They should charge big people extra.

773
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,000
他们才是拖累这个世界的人
They're the ones dragging down the world.

774
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:26,920
我知道
I know.

775
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,670
大人们看我们的样子就像我们是怪物一样
Big people look at us like we're freaks.

776
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,140
他们才是怪物
They're the freaks.

777
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,600
哦对了 你有没有听说在南极洲释放了大量的气体？
Oh, did you hear about all that gas being released in Antarctica?

778
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,660
好像是从冰上？释放沼气？
From the ice? The methane?

779
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,320
喔 最近我没有好好看新闻
Oh, I haven't really been following the news that much lately.

780
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,010
很明显这是个大事
Apparently it's a big deal.

781
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,350
科学家说冰融化得越多
Scientists are saying the more the ice melts,

782
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:45,200
会有更多的沼气泄出使更多的冰融化
the more methane comes out making more ice melt.

783
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,040
看来我们已经过了崩溃的临界点
Apparently we're already way beyond the tipping--

784
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,120
是我楼上的邻居
It's my upstairs neighbor.

785
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,340
好吧 这是最奇怪的事 我-这里几个月都没有这种声音
Well, it's the strangest thing, I-there wasn't a peep for months

786
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,620
我从来没想过他在那--
I don't even think he was here--

787
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,850
然后有一天 突然就
and then suddenly, it's

788
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,330
聚会 聚会 聚会
party, party, party.

789
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,010
几天前我不得不叫安保过来
I had to call security the other night.

790
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,280
杜赞！
Dusan!

791
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,100
嘿 杜赞！
Hey, Dusan!

792
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,010
杜赞！
Dusan!

793
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,640
怎么了？
Yes?

794
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,210
你介意音量调小一点吗？
You mind turning down the music?

795
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,950
我这边想过一个安静的夜晚
I'm trying to have a quiet evening down here.

796
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,550
你好 我的朋友
Hello, my friend.

797
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,210
你好 杜赞
Hello, Dusan.

798
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,840
我可以进来吗？
May I come in?

799
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:32,880
当然
Certainly.

800
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,250
听着 皮特
So, listen, Pete,

801
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,500
保罗
Paul.

802
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,600
- 保罗 - 保罗
-Paul. -Paul.

803
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,620
这是克里斯汀
And Kristen.

804
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,170
- 啊 你好 克里斯汀 - 嗨
-Ah, hello, Kristen. -Hi.

805
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,740
很抱歉打扰了你们美好的晚餐
I'm sorry I'm disturbing your nice little dinner.

806
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,840
听着…
Listen...

807
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,170
正如我所说 保罗
as I was saying, Paul,

808
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,590
今晚我那边还有一个
I'm having one more, you know,

809
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,410
小聚会要举办
little party at my place tonight.

810
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,580
不想上次那个规模那么大 非常小
Not big like last time. Very small.

811
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,650
只邀请几个亲近的朋友
Just a few close friends.

812
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,580
不是吧！
No!

813
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,870
那是一朵玫瑰？
Is that a rose?

814
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,130
- 是的 - 一朵真正的玫瑰？
-Yeah. -A real rose?

815
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,450
你从哪儿弄来的？
Where'd you get a real rose?

816
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,400
是一家新开的店 呃 全尺寸鲜花集市
It's a new store, uh, Full-Sized Flower Mart.

817
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,010
这朵要多少钱?
How much they're charging for this?

818
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,560
杜赞！
Dusan!

819
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,320
杜赞！
Dusan!

820
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,220
什么 亲爱的?
Quoi, ma Cherie?

821
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,840
你在下面做什么呢？
What are you doing down there?

822
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,940
是的 亲爱的 我来了
Oui, ma Cherie. J'arrive.

823
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,940
不管怎样
Anyway,

824
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,060
我是说
as I was saying,

825
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,820
保罗 如果今晚噪声打扰到你
Paul, if tonight noise disturbs you,

826
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,190
直接上来跟我讲
just come upstairs talk to me.

827
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,060
不用像刚才那样大肆宣扬
Don't make big show like last time,

828
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,650
像个疯子一样大喊大叫
yelling like crazy man.

829
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,550
我们是邻居 邻居就是朋友
We're neighbors. Neighbors are friends.

830
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,040
最好是什么呢 直接参加聚会吧
What's better even, come to the party.

831
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,830
谢谢 不过就像我刚才说的
Thanks, but like I said, we

832
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,640
我们只想安静地吃个晚饭
just want to have a quiet dinner.

833
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,260
尽量声音小点 好吗？
Just try to keep it down, okay?

834
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,060
是 亲爱的 当然
Yes, darling, of course.

835
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,880
嘘 嘘
Shh, shh.

836
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,990
嘘
Shh.

837
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,130
噢
Oh.

838
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,430
真是个愉快的晚上
Thanks for a really nice time.

839
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,550
谢谢你的烹饪和所做的一切
Plus the cooking and all.

840
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,220
抱歉我必须这么早走 临时保姆在家 所以…
Sorry I have to leave so early, but you know, the sitter...

841
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,160
没事 没事
Yeah, yeah. No...

842
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:21,900
我…
I was...

843
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,170
再上一层
Up one floor.

844
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:27,850
什么?
What?

845
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,690
是的 还有一层
Yeah, one more.

846
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,170
-谢谢 -噢 谢谢你 伙计
-Gracias -Oh, gracias, tio.

847
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,330
好了 呃
Anyway, uh,

848
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,450
我在想 呃 周末我们可以带上乔纳
I was hoping uh, Sunday we could bring Jonah.

849
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,900
我…我很想见见他
I... I'd love to meet him.

850
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,800
是啊…也许吧
Yeah...maybe.

851
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,450
- 有什么问题吗？ - 不
-Something wrong? -No.

852
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,290
你是个好人 保罗
You're a wonderful guy, Paul.

853
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,830
我真的很高兴和你在一起
And I really enjoy hanging out with you.

854
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,160
嗯哼
Uh-huh.

855
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,420
但是 老实说
But, if I'm honest about how I'm feeling,

856
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,660
我只是觉得 也许 呃 对我来说有点太快了
I just-it might be uh-- it might be too soon for me.

857
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,840
没关系 我明白了
It's fine, I get it.

858
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,280
- 不 我不是那个意思… - 我明白了 没关系
-No, no... -I get it. No, it's fine.

859
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,030
我只是说如果我们带上乔纳的话…
I just mean if we're bringing Jonah into it...

860
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,740
晚安
Have a nice night.

861
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,060
不 我…
No, I...

862
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,680
保罗！
Paul!

863
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,380
玫瑰！
A rose!

864
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,330
保罗！
Paul!

865
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,350
你来了
You come.

866
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,950
你还带了玫瑰
And you bring the rose.

867
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,360
- 这是谢罪礼 - 噢
-It's a peace offering. -Oh.

868
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,100
伙计们
Look, everyone.

869
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,940
这位是保罗 我的邻居
This is Paul, my neighbor.

870
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,380
看看他给我带了什么
And look at what he brings me.

871
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,240
他妈的真的玫瑰！
A real fucking rose!

872
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,370
你觉得这帮忘恩负义的狗娘养的货们
You think any of these other ungrateful sons of bitches

873
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,240
会想得起来带点东西给我吗？
think to bring something to Dusan?

874
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,890
不会 你是唯一一个
No. You're the only one.

875
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,010
我喜欢你
I like you.

876
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,620
我知道我说过这只是一个小聚会
But, I know I said it's only little party,

877
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,920
我只给两三个最亲密的朋友打了电话
but I make two, three phone calls to very close friends,

878
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,060
但是看看发生了什么
look what happens.

879
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,300
所有人都来了
Everybody comes.

880
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,270
这个该死的城市10点之后就无事可做
There's nothing else to do in this fucking city after 10 o'clock.

881
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:53,010
现在 这是我不明白的
Now, this I do not understand.

882
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,580
好像没有很多人在早上工作
It's not as if so many people have work in the morning.

883
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,270
这是身为小人最坏的一点
You know, this is worst trait about small people--

884
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,820
他们太懒
they're lazy.

885
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,380
不是所有人 但是懒
Not all, not all. But lazy.

886
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,710
就像…这个懒惰的混蛋
Like...this lazy son of a bitch.

887
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,350
康拉德！
Konrad!

888
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,930
你说我什么呢？
What's that you're saying about me?

889
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,600
你扯什么谎呢？
What lies are you telling?

890
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,340
只是在这个小世界没有人想工作
Just that in small world no one wants to work.

891
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,590
你还想指望什么？
What did you expect?

892
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,480
变小是一件美妙的事
It's the wonderful thing about becoming small.

893
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,260
因为你会立即变富
Because you're immediately rich.

894
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,190
除非你太穷了
Unless you're very poor.

895
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,490
那你就只是小
Then you're just small.

896
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,960
康拉德是一个船长
Konrad's a sea captain.

897
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,010
哦？
Oh?

898
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,660
从来没有离他的船超过十米远
Never more than ten meters away from his boat.

899
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,510
哦
Oh.

900
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,460
我真的爱我的船
I do like my boat.

901
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,340
她就在那儿
There she is.

902
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,510
索尼娅 我的美人
Sonja, my beauty.

903
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,860
我家世代是船长
You see, I'm from many generations.

904
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,990
回溯到我爷爷 我爸爸
All the way back to my grandfathers, my father--

905
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,290
都是船长
all sea captains.

906
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,840
所以是什么把你带到Leisureland？
So, what brings you to Leisureland?

907
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,990
杜赞
Dusan.

908
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,690
他甚至说服我变小
He even convinced me to become small,

909
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:59,510
主要为了女人和聚会
mostly for the women and the parties.

910
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,570
坦白说 我老婆拿着所有的钱
And, frankly, my wife had all the money,

911
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,590
她离开之后 事情变得有点棘手
and after she left, things became a bit tricky.

912
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,390
噢 我懂你
Oh, I can relate.

913
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,390
变小的生活相当不错 你不这么认为吗？
It's quite wonderful to be small, don't you think?

914
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,840
我只能说有好处有坏处
I'd say it has its pluses and minuses.

915
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,310
下个星期我要去塞舌尔
Next week I'll be in the Seychelles,

916
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,630
然后再过两星期 我将
and two weeks after that, I'll be

917
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,800
和朋友们在提提卡卡湖航行一个月
sailing with friends for a month on Lake Titicaca.

918
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,220
你相信吗？我从来没去过提提卡卡湖
Can you believe I've never been to Lake Titicaca?

919
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,960
好吧 但是船是怎么往返的呢？
Well, how does the boat get from place to place?

920
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,480
我是说 你又不能开船
I mean, you can't sail it.

921
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,740
用联邦快递运输 亲爱的老弟
FedEx, my dear boy.

922
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,790
索尼娅航行的速度比我快
Sonja travels faster than I do.

923
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,010
你是怎么弄到一把迷你尺寸的大键琴的？
How'd you get a tiny harpsichord down here?

924
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,250
嗯 没有-- 我必须把它养大
Well, I didn't--I had to have it raised.

925
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:02,200
怎么做？
Well, how?

926
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,650
打扰一下 那位是谁？
Excuse me, who is that?

927
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:11,480
- 那边的是谁？ - 嗯？
-Who's that? -Yeah.

928
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,360

That's little Ronni.

929
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,040
那是小罗尼？
That's little Ronni?

930
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,990
- 第一个出生的小婴儿 - 是啊
-The first small baby ever born. -Yeah.

931
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,220
- 回到挪威了？ - 天啦噜
-Back in Norway? -Shit.

932
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,680
- 那是小罗尼 - 是的
-That's little Ronni. -Yeah.

933
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,530
你该过去跟他说说话
You should go talk to him.

934
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,180
不好意思 呃…
Sorry, uh...

935
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,840
抱歉 打扰一下
Sorry, excuse me, um,

936
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:32,160
你-你真的是小罗尼？
is it-is it true you're little Ronni?

937
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,410
是啊 也许没那么小了
Well, maybe not so little anymore.

938
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,850
但是 是我
But yeah, it's me.

939
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,070
哇哦 真是…！
Wow, that's...!

940
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,930
你介意一起拍张自拍吗？
Do you thi-hey-would it be cool to get a selfie?

941
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,290
- 没问题 来这里 - 太棒了

Thank you, so are you.

946
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:47,740

947
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,640
不 我要知道这是什么 我-我有过敏症
No, I need to know. I-I have allergies.

948
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,550
等等！等等
Wait! Wait.

949
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,830
好吧
Okay.

950
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,500
? De Granada a Casablanca ?

951
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,930
? Enterré mi fantasía ?

952
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,370
? Una guitarra, y un gitano canta ?

953
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,330
? Canta mi Andalucía ?

954
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,000
我要把鞋脱了
I'm gonna take off my shoes.

955
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,280
玩的开心吗？
Having fun?

956
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,940
受够这该死的门铃了
Enough with the fucking doorbell.

957
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,070
早 杜赞先生 我们来做清洁
Good morning, Mr. Dusan. We come clean for you.

958
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,750
昨晚你玩的尽兴 对吗？
So you had fun last night, yeah?

959
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,210
你不知道有个我这么给力的邻居
You didn't know you were so lucky

960
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,640
是个多幸运的事
to have exciting neighbor such as me.

961
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,210
我从来没参加过这样的聚会
Well, I've never been to a party like that.

962
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:42,120
我从来没-那里有这么多欧洲人
I've nev-there were so many Europeans.

963
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,330
你知道小罗尼昨天也在吗？我是说…
Did you know little Ronni was here? I mean...

964
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,570
- 他可是历史性的人物 -也是个无聊的人
-he is historic. -And boring, you know.

965
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,130
英俊的挪威傻瓜

昨晚你又跳又笑

990
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:48,160
但是在那里面你哭了

991
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,020
谁跟你这么说的？
Who are you to talk to me that way?

992
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,420
我是杜赞·米尔科维奇 你的邻居
I'm Dusan Mirkovic, your neighbor.

993
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:56,580
邻居就是朋友
Neighbors are friends.

994
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,110
朋友只给朋友说实话

995
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:02,090
没错 也许有时我有那么一点点混蛋
Okay, maybe sometimes I'm a little bit asshole,

996
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,950
但这个世界需要混蛋
but the world needs assholes.

997
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,740
不然垃圾何处可去？
Otherwise where would shit go out.

998
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:08,630
杜赞…

01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,710
- 拜拜 - 谢谢你
-Bye. -Thank you.

1000
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,080
当我看到大人们变小
When I think of big people becoming small

1001
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,900
- 嗯 - 这世上出现了很多
-Mm-mm. -all the new small cities

1002
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:22,280
新的小城市 我就看到了机会
in the world, I see opportunity.

1003
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,060
我扪心自问 杜赞
I ask myself, Dusan,

1004
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,730
为什么人们想要变小？
why the people they want to become small?

1005
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,270
为了帮助保护环境？
To help the environment?

1006
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:30,680
拜托
Please.

1007
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,060
他们变小是为了得到物质
The become small to have the things

1008
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,960
那些至今为止只属于富人的东西
which until now were only for the rich,

1009
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,770
顺便说一下 这真是个天才的设想
which, by the way, is the genius of the concept.

1010
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:42,550
所以我找我兄弟斯尔詹谈了谈--我们在一起工作
So I say to my brother Srdjan-- I work with my brother.

1011
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,080
他依然是个大人
He's still big.

1012
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,990
顺便 我妻子也是
My wife, too, by the way.

1013
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,310
我说
I say,

1014
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,350
为什么不把特殊品
why not bring very special items,

1015
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,080
奢侈品 带给小顾客呢？
luxury items, to the small consumer?

1016
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,910
那些东西从来没人想到要去带
The-The things that nobody else is thinking to bring?

1017
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,510
比方说？
Such as?

1018
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,790

古巴产 世界上最顶级的雪茄
Cuba. Best cigar in the world.

1020
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:06,320
当你是个大人时要花多少钱买？
How much you pay for this when you big?

1021
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,440
45到50美金
Forty-five, fifty dollars.

1022

变小之后 我卖你这雪茄

1024
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:16,980
用一支科伊巴 我们能制造2000支小号雪茄
And from this one Cohiba, we make about 2,000 cigars.

1025
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,610
好吧 也许它们不是古巴产的
Okay, maybe they're not actually made in Cuba.

1026
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,960
也许它们是在布亚诺瓦茨的小阿尔巴尼亚卷出来的
Maybe they're rolled by little Albanians in Bujanovac

1027
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:25,050
但是谁在乎？
but who cares?

1028
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:26,800
而这只是一件东西
And this is just one thing.

宝贝 这里可是狂野西部

缓解疼痛和肿胀
It's for pain and swelling.

1046
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,070
那这个呢 是干嘛用的？
And this one, what this one do?

1047

Uh, well, Vicodin. That's also a pain killer,

1048
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,230
不过…这个用起来要非常小心
but...you wanna be really careful with that one.

1049
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,670
止痛药？止痛药好啊

1054
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,820
他们过期了 不好
They too old, no good.

1055

I can see that you have a really, really bad prosthetic foot

1060
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,200

and I'm sure it's causing you pain in your right hip and knee,

1061
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:35,590
或者是你另一边的膝盖和你的下背

You can do this but you work shit job answering phones?

1096

Well, when I moved down here, I didn't think I'd be working

1097
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,090
所以 我任由我的执照到期了而且…

It's a whole...it's a boring story.

1100
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,220
我不想这么说 但是…
I hate to say it, but...

1101
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,670
如果你不立刻找点事做
if you don't do something pretty soon,

1102
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:12,070
你就会需要一个新的膝盖了
you're gonna need a new knee.

1103
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,710
或者一个新的屁股
Maybe even a new hip.

1104
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,720
你需要去找专家看看
You gotta go to a specialist as soon as you can

1105
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,480
然后换一个新的脚
a-and get a whole new foot.

1106
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,850
同时呢
In the meantime,

1107
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,210
我可以对假肢训练做些调整
I could make some adjustments on the existing prosthetic.

1108
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,790
然后我或许可以给你一些可以更好行走的建议
And maybe give you some pointers on how to walk better.

1109
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:25,510
我只是不想看你毫无意义地受这些罪
I just hate to see you needlessly suffer

1110
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,960
在你经历了这么多之后
after all you've been through.

1111
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,560
好了 我完事了 跟我来
Okay. I finish work you come with me.

1112
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:32,300
啊 不了 我拿到我的工具了 我可以在这里把它完成
Yeah, no, I can get my tools, I can do it right here.

1113
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,640
不 我说的是之前提到的生病的朋友 需要药
No. I say you before my friend sick, need pill.

1114
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:38,160
你和我来家里 帮助她
You come with me my house. Help her.

1115
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,690
你帮助她
You help her.

1116
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,770
我不确定我能…我能帮你
I...I don't think I was clear. I can help you with this

1117
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,590
但我不是个医生 所以
but I'm not a doctor, so

1118
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,730
你的朋友 她怎么了？
your friend, whatever's wrong with her,

1119
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,160
她需要去诊所或者医院…
she's gotta go to a clinic or a hospital...

1120
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,740
不！诊所不好
No! Clinic no good.

1121
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,610
我带她去诊所等了很长时间
I bring her clinic wait too long time.

1122
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,930
但那些蠢货医生说的都是些废话
Stupid doctor say no help for her, no do nothing.

1123
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,720
他在大世界里是个蠢医生 现在他变小了
He no good stupid doctor in big world, now he small.

1124
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:00,360
和我来
You come with me.

1125
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:02,760
快和我来

1126
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,280

1128

你住在附近？

1129
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:28,750
不 还挺远的
No, still far.

1130
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,800
或许我们可以打个车
Maybe we should grab a car.

1131
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,530
不需要 坐公交即可
No need car. Take bus.

1132
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,750
冒昧问一句
If-If you don't mind my asking,

1133
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,830
你前几年挺有名的

1134
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,740
我是说 所有人都在谈论你
I mean, everybody was talking about you.

1135
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,580
我只是觉得你可能曾经

1136
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:58,010
发表演讲或是着书立说
giving speeches or writing books.

1137
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,500
你怎么会沦落到给别人做清洁工的地步？
How'd-How'd you wind up cleaning houses?

1138
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,340
为了生计
Need money for live.

1139
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,880
在上电视之后 我呆在医院几乎死了

Then three host family, but too much problems.

1141
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,860
休闲岛的人们太自私了
Leisureland people too selfish.

1142
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,690
我独自一人反而好些 赚钱吃饭 十分简单

1143
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,830

没时间做梦了

1149
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,280
我能问问要去几层么？

1326

还用了香草 但然而并没有什么用

1327
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,690
我觉得这是藓
I bet that's ringworm

1328
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:48,200
我不知道西班牙语怎么说
which I don't know how to say in Spanish.

1329
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,910
藓是一种真菌 所以
But ringworm is a fungus, so

1330
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,290
你想要它干燥的话

1331
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,660
山高 山高 不 不 阿瓜 阿瓜

1343

- 再见 -谢谢

1344
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,160
所以就这样？我们这就回家？
So that's it? We go home now?

1345
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,420
我们现在去教堂祷告
Now we go church pray Jesus.

1346
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:55,100
你明天八点来接我

1348
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,870
早上好啊 杜赞先生 我们来为你打扫了
Good morning, Mr. Dusan. We come clean for you.

1349
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:33,570
接电话可难以彰显您的身份
Answering telephones was not dignified enough for you.

1350
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:35,970
所以你现在被提拔去扫厕所了
Now you progress to cleaning toilets.

1351
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:37,690
我爱你 保罗

我真的爱你 你可真有意思

1353
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:42,280
真好玩儿
Hilarious.

1354
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:43,910
像我说的
Like I said,

1355
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:46,190
你真是个好人
you're too much nice guy

1356
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,080
也有那么一点可怜
and a little bit...pathetic guy.

1357
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,830
到她安个新脚为止
It's just until she gets a new foot.

1358
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,550
- 那是啥时候啊 - 不知道呢
-When will that be. -I don't know.

1359
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,910
那个医生说要一个月 也可能六个礼拜
The doctor said a month, maybe six weeks.

1360
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,100
- 那可得有段时间了 -我知道
-Ah, that's an eternity. -I know.

1361
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,180
那这段时她只能用假腿了
Meantime she's stuck with a peg leg,

1362
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:01,400
聊胜于无罢了
which is almost as bad as having nothing at all.

1363
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:02,400
我是说 看看她
I mean, look at her,

1364
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,600
现在她像个该死的海盗似的晃来晃去！
she's waddling around like a goddamned pirate!

1365
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,930
保罗！别和杜赞先生说话了！
Paul! You no talk with Mr. Dusan!

1366
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,770
你和维罗妮卡一起上楼！

1367
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,570
-保罗！-听到了
-Paul! -I heard you.

1368
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,640
别担心 保罗

1369
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,150
杜赞会救你的
Dusan will save you.

1370
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,960

Wow.

01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,980
是啊 陈小姐 都拿走吧
Yeah, Miss Tran, take everything.

1372
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:42,070
康拉得先生和我后天就要走了
Mr. Konrad and I are leaving day after tomorrow

1373
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:44,310
而且不知道我们什么时候回来
and don't know when we'll be back.

1374
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,090
好的 谢谢你
Okay good. Thank you.

1375

1376

你帮我找个大箱子
You go find me big box.

1377
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:52,070
马上
In a minute.

1378
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:55,180
不过我得先说一件重要的事情
First there's something very important to discuss.

1379
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,020
和我么？
Me?

1380
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,390
情况是这样
This is the situation.

1381
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:02,730
我们不知道具体咋回事
I don't know exactly what,

1382
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:04,830
但情况真的是严重很严重
but something big-- very big-

1383
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,490
它发生在最初的缩小殖民地里
is happening at the original small colony.

1384
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,280
你知道的 挪威的那个
You know, the one in Norway.

1385
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,830
他们想让我立即去那里
They want me to go there right away

1386
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,110
并带给他们一份非常重要的东西
with a very important delivery.

1387
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:15,970
这件事要解释起来就太复杂了
It's too complicated to explain.

1388
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,320
这是机密而且…十分紧急
Top secret and... very urgent.

1389
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:23,650
最重要的是他们许我们以重金
Most important they are offering us very big money.

1390
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,030
非常多的钱
Very big.

1391
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,330
这意味着我们需要额外的帮助
That means we need extra help

1392
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,180
尽快完成这件事 来取悦他们
to do this quickly, make them happy.

1393
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,870
而且很遗憾我要这么说 但我们需要同样优秀的帮手
And I'm sorry to say, we need the same excellent helper

1394
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,580

1395
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:36,650
他

1396
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:38,630
是的 玉兰
That's right, Ngoc Lan,

1397
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,270
我必须和他们去挪威
I have to go with these guys to Norway.

1398
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,170
所以你是说…
So... you say...

1399
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:48,610
保罗跟你们去挪威？
Paul go with you Norway?

1400
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,710
形势所迫

1401
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:52,720
情况紧急
Emergency situation.

1402
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,840
完全出于人道主义
And deeply humanitarian.

1403
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,860
我的意思是 玉兰 我会
I mean, Ngoc Lan, I will

1404
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,710
安然无恙的回来帮你

1405
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,350
当新假肢 还有
when the new foot, and--

1406
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,910
你们周三就出发？

01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,430
是的
Yes.

01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:13,830
10天 也可能更久
Ten days. Maybe more.

1410
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:21,620
好吧 挪威

1412
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,840

1416
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:33,840
但你还得在这
But you're very busy here

1417
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:36,250

还有你的清扫生意
And your cleaning business.

1419
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:41,370
维拉妮卡她们对这些一清二楚
Veronica and other ladies know every place.

1420
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,010

挪威移民邀请了我很多次

1423
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,350
但我还从没去过

1463
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,860

这听起来真不错

1468
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,180
您不知道我们对陈女士的事
You have no idea how terribly

1469
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,190
感到多么难过
grief-stricken we were by Miss Tran's case.

1470
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:58,270
乔根因为这项技术导致的失误辗转难眠
Jorgen has lost so much sleep over all the abuses.

1471
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,410
这样的景色令人望而生畏 是吧
It's humbling, huh?

1472
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:14,650
大自然真是极富耐心的雕刻家
Nature is such a patient sculptor.

1473
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:16,810
每天雕琢一点
Grinding a tiny bit

1474
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:20,920
每天一点点 历经千年
each day slowly, slowly for thousands of years to

1475
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,910
竟雕刻出如此壮美的景色
make such a supremely beautiful thing.

1476
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:28,790
太可惜了
What a waste.

1477
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,100
真是太可惜了
What a dreadful waste.

1478
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,470
希望你们能原谅乔根
You'll have to excuse Jorgen.

1479
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:48,810
这些日子他真的非常难熬
These past few days has been especially hard.

1480
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,950
这样的重大决定做的如此之迅速
Such a big decision to make and so quickly.

1481
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:54,490
通常我们到移民聚集地
Normally when we visit the Colony,

1482
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,090
都会在霍宁斯沃格呆几天
we like to spend a few days in Honningsv?g.

1483
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:58,690
但是发生了那件事
But then the news came...

1484
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,670
然后 我们就到这了
and uh, yeah, well, here we are

1485
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,710
形势所迫
suddenly imposing on you.

1486
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:06,710
我们根本来不及收拾行李
We scarcely had the time to pack.

1487
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,700
抱歉 你说的是什么事
I'm sorry, w-what news?

1488
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,650
甲烷泄露
Why, the methane release.

1489
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,480
在南极 你知道甲烷吧
In Antarctica. You must know about the methane.

1490
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,270
知道
Yeah...

1491
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:20,270
这并不新鲜 是吧 我是说
that's not-that's not new, is it? I mean--

1492
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,170
不管新鲜不新鲜
New or old,

1493
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:24,380
这就是终点
it's the end.

1494
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:28,290
一切都完了
It's the end of everything.

1495
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:34,880
世界已经经历了5次灭绝
The world has already seen five major extinctions,

1496
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,740
这将是第6次
and now there will be another.

1497
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,310
我 我也不愿相信
I...I didn't want to believe it.

1498
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,890
没人愿意相信 但
None of us did, but

1499
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:45,060
我们在赫尔辛基时 那儿缩小和没缩小的人都在一起
there we were in Helsinki, big and small.

1500
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:50,020
气候学家 细菌学家 人口学家 物理学家

1501
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,630

1502
01:37:51,850 --> 01:37:55,060
足足有26名诺贝尔获得者
26 Nobel Prize winners among us.

1503
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:58,390
我们建了无数模型 进行了无数运算
We built all the models, did all the math,

1504
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:01,360
结论都一致
and all conclusion was consistent.

1505
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,470
智人将从地球消失
Homo Sapiens will soon vanish from the Earth.

1506
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,560
这是万分精确的必然
It is now an actuarial certainty.

1507
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,180
无论末日以什么形式来临
No matter how the end will come--

1508
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,980
环境灾难
environmental disaster,

1509
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,680

1512
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:26,030
核冬天 或者几种形式夹杂袭来
nuclear winter, some combination of them all.

1513
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:32,370
与此同时地球本身也将对人类进行净化
Relatively soon the Earth will indeed purge itself of human life,

1514
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:36,040
只有上帝知道会有多少物种受牵连
and God knows how many other species.

1515
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,460
你是说真的灭绝吗 缩小不管用吗
Do you really mean extinction? What about downsizing?

1516
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:42,410
嗯 缩小能使灭绝来的晚一些
Yeah, yeah, too little too late.

1517
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:45,650
世界人口只缩小了三分之一
Only three percent of the world has miniaturized.

1518
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:48,080
时间太紧了
There simply isn't enough time.

1519
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,670
智人也不算进化非常成功的物种
Not a very successful species, these Homo Sapiens,

1520
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:58,630
尽管拥有高智商
even with such great intelligence.

1521
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,370
智人存在短短20万年
Barely 200,000 years.

1522
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:04,520
短嘴鳄却已经存在20亿年了
Alligator has survived 200 million years

1523
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:07,310
凭着只有核桃那么大的脑袋
with a brain the size of a walnut.

1524
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:13,540
上千年来人类从未停止
People have been predicting the end of the world

1525
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:15,240
预测世界末日
for thousands of years.

1526
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:18,210
现在末日真的来了
And now it's really happening.

1527
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:23,200
我猜有人猜对了
I guess somebody had to be right someday.

1528
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,870
真遗憾
So sad.

1529
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:28,810
非常遗憾
Very sad.

1530
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:44,910
好了 我去睡了
Okay, I go sleep now.

1531
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:46,580
晚安 保罗
Good night, Paul.

1532
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:49,070
晚安 玉兰
Good night, Ngoc Lan.

1533
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:52,830
哦
Ay.

1534
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:54,500
你没事吧
You okay?

1535
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:55,930
我没事
I fine.

1536
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,700
我觉得我应该检查一下你的腿
You know, maybe I should take a look at your leg.

1537
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:00,770
好啊 你来检查吧
Okay, yes, you look.

1538
01:40:05,570 --> 01:40:06,700
哦 呀
Oh, yup.

1539
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:08,180
哦
Wow.

1540
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:11,860
木桩擦破了皮
That peg is really making the skin chafe.

1541
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:13,750
嗯
Okay.

1542
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,700
你知道吗
You know,

1543
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,200
如果十年前有人跟我说
if somebody told me ten years ago

1544
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:28,640
有天我只有5英尺大
that one day I'd be five inches tall,

1545
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:29,660
离了婚
divorced,

1546
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,620
还帮一个着名的越南异派做义肢
helping a famous Vietnamese dissident get a new foot

1547
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,240
巡游穿越挪威海峡时
while cruising up a fjord in Norway

1548
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:38,310
还和乔根·阿斯比恩森谈论世界末日
discussing the end of the world with Jorgen Asbjornsen,

1549
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,250
我肯定认为他疯了
I would've said he was crazy.

1550
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,690
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1551
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,190
抱歉 我以为
I'm sorry. I-I thought--

1552
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:22,440
天啊 我真蠢
Jesus, I'm such an idiot.

1553
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,770
不
No.

1554
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,440
没关系
Please.

1555
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:28,010
我想要
I want.

1556
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,610
早
Morning.

1557
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,300
早上好
Good morning.

1558
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:15,280
那是什么声音
What's that sound?

1559
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,060
问候声
A greeting.

1560
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,870
哇
Wow!

1561
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:54,600
就是那 那是原来的移民聚集地
That's it, that's the original colony.

1562
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,620
等等 这没有防护网也没有隔离墙吗
Wait, and there's no net? No walls?

1563
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,110
没有 我们很幸运
No, we've been lucky.

1564
01:43:59,170 --> 01:44:02,090
这里蚊子成灾
We are too close to the sea for the mosquitoes.

1565
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:04,330
多年来 我们发现
And over the years, we realized

1566
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,140
这儿的鸟儿更喜欢吃旅鼠
that the birds, they preferred the lemmings.

1567
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:09,740
没错 我们就是从这开始的
But yes, this is where we started

1568
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,610
很多年前
many years ago.

1569
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,820
乔根 你好啊
Jorgen, good to see you.

1570
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:50,760
欢迎
Welcome.

1571
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,570
哦 不
No, no.

1572
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,000
乔根
Jorgen!

1573
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,960
安妮·海琳
Anne-Helene!

1574
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,760
哦 你来这儿真是太好了
Oh, thank God you're here!

1575
01:44:57,790 --> 01:45:00,450
为什么没人告诉我你来了
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1576
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:04,080
哦 我太爱你了
Oh, I love you so much.

1577
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,770
我也爱你们
I love you both so much.

1578
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:10,200
哦 自从做了那个决定以来
Oh, ever since the decision,

1579
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,300
你不在这 我就觉得一切都不对
I didn't feel right without you here.

1580
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,390
你知道我多担心
And you know how I am when I worry.

1581
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:16,360
吃不下 睡不着
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

1582
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:18,580
这儿的每个人都能为我作证
Ask anyone here, they tell you.

1583
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,760
抱歉打扰一下 乔根
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

1584
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:23,000
我们现在急需你的建议
but we need your advice immediately.

1585
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:24,840
好的 抱歉 索尔维格
Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

1586
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:28,180
没事 亲爱的 你还有要事在身
Of course, darling. You've got important things to do.

1587
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:32,350
哦 杜赞 杜赞 杜赞
Oh! Dusan, Dusan, Dusan!

1588
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:35,420
你这么快就到了真是太好了
Bless you for coming so quickly.

1589
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:41,030
索尔维格 亲爱的 我随时恭候
Solveig, my darling, I'm always happy to help

1590
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,900
不管是困境顺境还是幸福时刻
in difficult times, in easy times, in happy times.

1591
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:47,300
我都乐意来拜访你和友好的村民们
Is always a pleasure to come and visit you and your lovely village.

1592
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:50,160
哦 你太好了
Oh, it is lovely, isn't it?

1593
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:53,600
难以想象不能再次见到你
I can't bear to think I won't see it again.

1594
01:45:54,060 --> 01:45:56,780
你知道 起初是我建立了
You know, I'm the one who made this colony

1595
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:58,770
这个聚集地
possible in the first place.

1596
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:01,640
我小时候就来过
I've been coming since I was just a baby.

1597
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,960
我记得有一次
I remember one time--

1598
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:07,360
等等 我认识你
Wait. I know you.

1599
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,140
我昨晚梦见你了
You were in my dream last night.

1600
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:15,210
梦里你是一匹马也许是小马驹 很健壮的那种
You were a horse or a pony-- something very strong.

1601
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:20,280
我骑着你穿越险象环生的森林
And I mounted you and rode you through a dangerous forest.

1602
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,920
-是吗 - 现在你来了
-Okay. -And here you are.

1603
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:25,730
在我们离开之前你来了
Right before we leave.

1604
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,260
又是一个奇迹
Another miracle.

1605
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,610
你是来加入我们的 是吗
You are coming with us, aren't you?

1606
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:33,450
你去哪儿
Where are you going?

1607
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,240
去里面
In there.

1608
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:38,420
你想进去看看吗
Would you like to see?

1609
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,920
这儿通向哪儿
Where this go?

1610
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,910
通向地下
To the vault.

1611
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:56,630
- 地下？ - 没错
-The vault? -Oh, yes.

1612
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,230
很早以前我们就开始挖了
We've been working on it almost since the very beginning.

1613
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,070
当乔根做出那个伟大的发现时
When Jorgen made his big discovery,

1614
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,070
我是说 瞧啊 乔根 你是个天才
I said, look, Jorgen, you're a genius,

1615
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:10,640
缩小是天才的想法 没人质疑这一点
and downsizing is a genius idea. No one is questioning that.

1616
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:14,370
但要是人们不能接受怎么办
But what if people don't accept it?

1617
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:17,290
如果结果并非我们所想？
What if it doesn't come out on time?

1618
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,310
不管怎样 这是他们想出来的
Anyway, this is what they came up with.

1619
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:22,230
根据我的建议
On my suggestion.

1620
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:26,850
托瓦兹 我的甜心 带我们的朋友参观一下
Torvald, be a sweetheart and give our friends a little tour.

1621
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,810
好的
Well, sure.

1622
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,070
这条隧道通向地下
The tunnel leads to a vault

1623
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:34,370
深入地壳1.6千米
1.6 kilometers inside the Earth's lithosphere

1624
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:37,710
由双层因科镍合金625围护
and is encased in a double layer of Inconel 625.

1625
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:41,690
为确保广泛的物种多样性
In addition to maintaining a broad spectrum of biodiversity,

1626
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:45,520
洞穴里备有土层供植物生长
the vault is equipped with fields for growing foods,

1627
01:47:45,550 --> 01:47:49,320
有森林提供木材 有牲畜发展畜牧业
forests for lumber, livestock for animal husbandry.

1628
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:52,330
居住区域广阔无边
The residential areas are spacious

1629
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:55,990
供未来多少代人口在此生存都绰绰有余
and easily expandable to provide for future generations.

1630
01:47:57,570 --> 01:48:00,170
等等 但是这些不都在地下吧
Wait, but that's not all underground?

1631
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:01,170
没错
Oh, yes!

1632
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:04,550
微缩的身型让我们在地上生存成为可能
Our new small size makes it possible.

1633
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,510
否则做梦也别想
Otherwise we never could have dreamed of preserving

1634
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:11,200
在这样一个安全的地方维持这样大的一个世界
so much of the world in a single safe place.

1635
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:13,000
太赞了
This is brilliant.

1636
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:17,130
很赞是吧 就像 就像诺亚方舟
Isn't this brilliant? It's like- It's like Noah's Ark.

1637
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:20,340
没错 简直就是诺亚方舟
Yes. exactly! It's Noah's Ark!

1638
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:23,220
那么 能源是什么 核能吗
So, how-what do you do for power, is it nuclear?

1639
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,530
不 不是的 完全使用地热能
No, no, 100% geothermal.

1640
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,830
而且我们有相互协作的有机体系
And we have interoperable organic systems

1641
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:30,500
可以人工生产太阳能
to manage production of artificial sunlight,

1642
01:48:30,590 --> 01:48:34,690
氧气 消除二氧化碳 净化水源等等
oxygen, CO2 elimination, water purification, and so on.

1643
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:39,530
那你们要在这呆多久
And how long will you stay down there?

1644
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:43,590
托瓦兹 多久 8000年？
Torvald, how long is it? 8,000 years?

1645
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:45,280
嗯 差不多吧
Well, something like that.

1646
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:48,210
直到地球表面环境趋于稳定为止
Just until the surface environment stabilizes.

1647
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,190
我们现在做的并非史无前例
It's not unprecedented what we are doing here.

1648
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:56,910
大概100年前
Less than a hundred thousand years ago

1649
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,540
人类经历了一次核灭绝
humans underwent a near-extinction.

1650
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,880
可能只有2000人得以幸存
Maybe 2,000 survived.

1651
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,470
此后由那些人
And from that handful

1652
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,860
繁衍出如今数十亿的人类
came all of the billions of people you see today.

1653
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,240
所有物种重启 我们做的这些一点也不新鲜
Rebooting the species. It's nothing new.

1654
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,750
是的 确实是
Yeah, exactly.

1655
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,110
我的朋友们
My friends.

1656
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:21,300
多年前
Many years ago,

1657
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:24,570
当我们发现细胞可以被缩小
when we discovered cellular miniaturization,

1658
01:49:24,730 --> 01:49:27,460
这个不断遭遇厄运的世界
the world which had seemed so doomed

1659
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:30,280
突然又充满了无数可能性
felt suddenly so full of possibilities.

1660
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:35,430
直到最近 我仍然希望
So, until very recently, I maintained hope

1661
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:38,400
明天开展的应急计划
that the contingency plan we embark upon tomorrow

1662
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:40,850
依然只是
could remain simply that--

1663
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,700
一个计划而已
a plan.

1664
01:49:44,310 --> 01:49:45,440
但是
But...

1665
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,700
历史被打破了
history has spoken.

1666
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,800
这是我们在多年来一直称为家园的地方的
And this is our final dinner in the place we've called home

1667
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,720
最后一餐
for so many years.

1668
01:49:55,190 --> 01:49:58,480
没错 离开这里固然令人伤心
Yes, we are sad to leave,

1669
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:03,650
离开的缘由也同样令人难过
and terribly sad for the reasons why.

1670
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:08,610
但人类这个物种太美妙了
But man is too beautiful,

1671
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,610
是太不可思议的生命形式
too improbable a life form

1672
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:16,380
因而绝不能允许其永远从宇宙消失
to be allowed to disappear forever from the cosmos.

1673
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:20,370
现在
Now then,

1674
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:24,940
我想问一下原聚集地
I would like to ask the surviving members of the

1675
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:27,370
生存下来的人们
original colony to stand.

1676
01:50:39,310 --> 01:50:41,550
看看他
Ah, look at him.

1677
01:50:41,670 --> 01:50:43,310
小罗尼
Little Ronni.

1678
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,680
他是怎样长大成人的
How he has grown.

1679
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:52,440
我再问你们一次
I ask you again

1680
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,200
正如我多年前问的那样
as I asked you so many years ago.

1681
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,100
一代接一代
Generations to come,

1682
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,740
或许整个人类都会感激你们
perhaps all of humanity will thank you

1683
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:02,990
为你们今天的勇气和承诺
for your bravery and commitment.

1684
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,940
但你们必须问一问自己
But you must ask yourself

1685
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,830
是否真的准备好进入新世界
whether you are truly ready to enter a new world.

1686
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:10,540
因为那儿有去无回
For there will be no turning back.

1687
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:14,380
你们准备好了吗
Are you ready?

1688
01:51:15,470 --> 01:51:16,680
我准备好了
I am ready!

1689
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,130
我准备好了
I am ready!

1690
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:19,460
- 我准备好了 - 是的
-I am ready! -Yes!

1691
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:20,870
我准备好了
I am ready!

1692
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:22,770
大家准备好了吗
Is everyone ready?

1693
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:29,940
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1694
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:31,440
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1695
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:33,120
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1696
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,710
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1697
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:36,350
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1698
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,040
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1699
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,830
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1700
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:41,460
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1701
01:51:41,950 --> 01:51:43,270
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1702
01:51:43,810 --> 01:51:45,070
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1703
01:51:45,590 --> 01:51:46,660
我们准备好了
We are ready!

1704
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:12,970
保罗
Paul!

1705
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:15,840
什么事
Yeah.

1706
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:18,060
你能过来吗？
Can you come down here?

1707
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:26,300
你去哪了？ 我到处找你
Where you go? I look many place for you.

1708
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:28,760
我哪儿也没去
I was just here.

1709
01:52:29,210 --> 01:52:32,030
我在这和杜赞先生聊聊 他说那个胖女人付钱了
I talk with Mr. Dusan, he say fat lady pay,

1710
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:33,330
他准备回去了
he ready go back.

1711
01:52:33,620 --> 01:52:34,650
我很高兴听你这么说
I happy for that.

1712
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:38,160
我们离开卡德纳斯先生和洛佩兹夫人太久了
Too long time away from Se?or Cardenas and Mrs. Lopez.

1713
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,820
恩 我很担心他们
Oh, I worry too much for them.

1714
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:42,940
玉兰 你不能只是
Ngoc Lan, you can't just be

1715
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:46,270
担心千里之外的那小部分人
worried for a few little people thousands of miles away.

1716
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,440
你的目光要放远大些
You have to look at the big picture.

1717
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,850
你为什么这么说
Why you say like this?

1718
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:55,240
因为 卡德纳斯先生和洛佩兹夫人
Because...Mr. Cardenas and Mrs. Lopez,

1719
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,420
他们没机会了
they don't stand a chance,

1720
01:52:58,060 --> 01:52:59,390
我们也没有
None of us do.

1721
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,000
都结束了
It's over.

1722
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,670
你想跟他们一起去
You want go with them.

1723
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,500
我希望你也跟我一起
And I want you to come with me.

1724
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,550
你简直疯了
You crazy man!

1725
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:13,560
我一直以为你只是蠢 现在我知道你还是个疯子
Always I know you stupid. Now I see you crazy too.

1726
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:14,910
我怎么就是疯子了
How am I crazy?

1727
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,130
你听见他们说的话了
You heard them.

1728
01:53:16,190 --> 01:53:18,620
这是拯救人类的唯一机会
This is the only chance for the survival of our species--

1729
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:19,940
这太扯了
that's huge!

1730
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:21,450
你想帮忙？
You want to help people?

1731
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,660
这就是那些你应该帮助的人
These are the people that you should be helping.

1732
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:27,670
人类的未来就在那洞穴的下面
The future of humanity is down that hole!

1733
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:29,760
你到那儿是去帮谁？
Who you help down there?

1734
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:33,140
这儿的人确实需要帮助但没必要非得到那愚蠢的洞里
People here need help, not down stupid hole!

1735
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:37,100
杜赞先生 康纳德先生
Mr. Dusan, Mr. Konrad,

1736
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:38,510
保罗疯了 和他谈谈吧
talk to crazy Paul.

1737
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:41,060
他想下到洞里 还让我跟他一起去
He want go down hole, me go with him.

1738
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,260
保罗 保罗 保罗
Paul, Paul, Paul...

1739
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,780
你为什么要做这种蠢事
Why do you want to do such a silly thing?

1740
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:47,340
杜赞 这些人确实在试着做点什么
Dusan, these people are actually trying to do something

1741
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:50,760
拯救人类 我也想这么做
to save the human race. I wanna be a part of that.

1742
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:52,290
好啊 你想帮忙
Okay, fine, you want to help

1743
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:54,560
那就跟我一样 为他们提供精液样本
then do what I did, give them a semen sample.

1744
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:55,840
我也这么做了
I did it too.

1745
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:57,940
极为乐意的提供了帮助
A much more pleasant way to help.

1746
01:53:58,350 --> 01:54:00,030
如果我不愿参与这件事
If I'm not supposed to be a part of this thing,

1747
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,820
那我在这做什么
then w-what am I doing here?

1748
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,740
我为什么不是医生呢
Why didn't I become a doctor?

1749
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:07,980
为什么我会缩小 为什么我的妻子抛弃了我
Why did I downsize? Why did my wife abandon me?

1750
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:10,690
杜赞 你怎么刚好就是我的邻居
Dusan, how did you just happen to be my neighbor?

1751
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:11,930
还有 玉兰  为什么你是
And-And Ngoc Lan, why are you

1752
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,820
在那个盒子里唯一的幸存者
the only person who survived that box

1753
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,560
你那天是真的碰巧
and you just happen to be cleaning

1754
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,170
在打扫杜赞的房子吗
Dusan's place on that day?

1755
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:18,720
而且你没有失去你的腿
And-And had you not lost your leg,

1756
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:20,820
我不是没想过试着帮助你 可是就像以前一样
I wouldn't have tried to help you, which, as usual,

1757
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,930
我搞砸了
I screwed up.

1758
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,790
为什么我又把事情搞砸了
And why did I screw it up?

1759
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,680
这样我就可以
So that I could be here

1760
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:29,410
在正确的时刻进入这个隧道
right at the exact moment to go down into that tunnel.

1761
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:33,740
我终于有机会去做点正事了
I finally have a chance to do something that matters.

1762
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,930
保罗 拜托 你在说胡话
Oh, Paul, come on, now you're talking crazy.

1763
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:38,500
那些人是很棒 但是
These people, they're wonderful, but--

1764
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:39,850
像个邪教
It's like a cult.

1765
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:42,110
他们就是邪教 你知道的 可能已经灭绝了
It's a cult. You know, and the extinction, well,

1766
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:44,950
不可能发生在现在 但是几百年前可说不好
it's not gonna happen for, you know, maybe few hundred years.

1767
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:47,060
这些都和你无关 忘了吧
Has nothing to do with you. Forget it.

1768
01:54:47,170 --> 01:54:50,000
另外 你认为他们不会假装表现成正常人那样吗
Besides, you think they won't behave like people always behave?

1769
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:52,420
他们都会疯掉然后互相残杀
They're all gonna go insane down there and kill each other.

1770
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,510
在我们这么做之前 他们早已经灭绝了
They'll go extinct long before we do.

1771
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:08,150
别担心 亲爱的 他就是自言自语
Don't worry, darling. He said it himself.

1772
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,230
他几乎没做成什么事情过
Nothing he ever wants to do works out.

1773
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:49,660
今天天气不错 是吧
It's a beautiful day, huh?

1774
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,280
我的意思是 知道这次是我最后一次看到真正的太阳以后
I mean, knowing this is the last time I'll see the real sun,

1775
01:55:53,310 --> 01:55:55,830
太阳看起来 很有 活力
it makes it so... vibrant.

1776
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:03,710
我问你问题 你告诉我真话 可以吗
I ask you question. You say me truth. Okay?

1777
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:04,810
当然了
Of course.

1778
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:07,040
那天晚上在船上
Other night on boat...

1779
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:09,070
你因为什么和我发生关系
what kind of fuck you give me?

1780
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:10,560
什么
What?

1781
01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:12,740
你给我的是什么炮？
What kind of fuck you give me?

1782
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,660
什么 我不懂
What kind? I don't...

1783
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:18,060
美国人 八种不同的炮
American people, eight kind of fuck.

1784
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:21,470
是因为爱 因为恨 还是只是为了做爱而做爱
Love fuck, hate fuck, sex-only fuck,

1785
01:56:21,560 --> 01:56:23,470
是分手炮 和好炮
break-up fuck, make-up fuck,

1786
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:26,140
酒后炮 友情炮 还是同情炮
drunk fuck, buddy fuck, pity fuck.

1787
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,870
好吧 我不知道你从哪听来这个的
Okay, I-I have no idea where you heard that.

1788
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:30,150
第三个寄宿家庭
Third host family.

1789
01:56:30,170 --> 01:56:32,460
好吧 这些都是错的
Okay, Th-that is just wrong.

1790
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:34,640
我和你发生关系  是一种全方位
Okay, there's a whole spectrum

1791
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:37,390
的情感动力驱使的
of-of emotions and- and motivations.

1792
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,350
还有不要说 “操” 这是脏话
And don't say "fuck", i-it's vulgar.

1793
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:43,830
说别的来代替 比如做爱之类的
Say something else like, you know, "make love" or I don't know.

1794
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,940
所以 是因为爱我吗
So... was love fuck?

1795
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:50,890
好吧 你提这些到底想干什么
Okay, what is this all about?

1796
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:57,130
你找到我 你想帮助我
You look for me, you want help me,

1797
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:58,940
你和我做爱
you make fuck with me,

1798
01:56:59,110 --> 01:57:01,100
现在你在装傻充愣吗
now you go down stupid hole.

1799
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,650
所以我试着去思考
So I try to think

1800
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:06,030
你到底是因为什么而和我做爱
what kind fuck you give me.

1801
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:09,190
现在我觉得可能是同情炮了
I think maybe pity fuck.

1802
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:10,160
因为我的腿
For leg.

1803
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:12,730

我希望你和我一起走
I want you to come with me.

1809
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:31,580
人们都说我很坚强
People always say me I strong.

1810
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,370
好的 可能因为我来自越南
Okay, maybe Vietnam

1811
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:38,940
我组织了很多次抗议

被惩罚缩小

我是唯一一个在电视盒子里存活下来的人

1815
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:48,100
我没有脚来走路
I walk around no foot.

1816
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:50,000
我照顾别人
Take care of other people.

1817
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,070
但是我是个女人
But I woman.

1818
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:53,710

1822

But if I don't do this, who am I?

1823
