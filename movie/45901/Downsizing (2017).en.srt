00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,460
It gives me great pleasure to welcome
the director of the Institute

3
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:47,860
and my old friend,

4
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,859
Dr. Andreas Jacobsen.

5
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,060
Thank you.

6
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,824
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Pereira.

7
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:08,359
Seventy-five years ago,
Ms. Nellie Edvardsen,

8
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,259
overcome with guilt
by the fortune

9
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,792
her late husband's family
had amassed

10
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,956
producing mustard gas
during World War I,

11
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,091
founded our Institute

12
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,425
so that the wonders of science

13
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:21,158
could instead be used
to help mankind.

14
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,158
In the 1950s,

15
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,890
the Institute identified
overpopulation

16
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:30,855
as mankind's single greatest
long-term threat.

17
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:32,390
The cause of all the
catastrophes

18
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:33,723
we are seeing today:

19
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,924
Extreme climate
and weather events,

20
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:40,057
and the devastating impact on
food and water security.

21
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:44,122
Among the many solutions
we conceived so many years ago

22
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,088
one, which seemed
then so ambitious,

23
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,256
so out of our grasp,

24
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:51,389
has finally borne fruit.

25
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,188
And today we are
proud to unveil

26
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,256
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical,

27
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,389
humane and inclusive remedy

28
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,921
to humanity's gravest problem.

29
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:03,157
My colleague,
Dr. Jorgen Asbjornsen,

30
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,288
will now present his findings.

31
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,288
Are you ready, Doctor?

32
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,889
Yes, I'm ready.

33
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:39,456
Please take your seats.

34
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:43,685
Please sit down,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

35
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,353
Please take your seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

36
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:47,653
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

37
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,521
Thank you, thank you.

38
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,521
Dr. Pereira,
esteemed colleagues.

39
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,485
Five years ago,
building on the research

40
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:04,985
of our predecessors
at the Institute,

41
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,750
my team and I
discovered a process

42
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,718
by which all organic material

43
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:12,519
can be reduced
at the cellular level

44
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,019
by a ratio of approximately

45
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:18,817
2,744 to 1.

46
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,550
Such a process converts
a man of 1.8 meters

47
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:26,216
to just 12.9 centimeters.

48
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:28,718
A wide array
of flora and fauna

49
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,216
were subjected
in this process,

50
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:34,884
and, with the exception
of some fish and shellfish,

51
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,819
absolutely no side effects
were detected.

52
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:40,951
Please, lights.

53
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,216
Once the safety of
the procedure was confirmed,

54
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:52,117
36 brave volunteers joined
my wife Anne-Helene and me

55
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,216
as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction.

56
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,882
The process
is short and painless,

57
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,983
with only the
mild discomfort of

58
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:05,382
removal and replacement of
dental and other prosthetics.

59
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:08,781
The subjects are placed
under light sedation

60
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:13,583
and after a brief rest, fully
recover within an hour or two.

61
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,814
Once completed,
our little village,

62
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,913
just 7 meters by 11 meters,

63
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:28,947
was placed inside
a gas-permeable enclosure

64
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,947
designed to protect us
from the hazards of

65
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,415
weather, animals and insects.

66
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:37,281
Thus we set about
to live together

67
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:42,682
in the world's very first
self-sustaining community of the small.

68
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,213
I hold here in my hand

69
00:06:47,216 --> 00:06:49,480
all of the uncompostable waste

70
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:52,983
produced by 36 people
over four years.

71
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:04,048
In this afternoon's session,
we will outline

72
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,646
our proposal for a two to
three hundred-year transition

73
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,045
for the world to transform
from big into small.

74
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,512
But for now,

75
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:16,047
I'd like you all to meet some
very special people. Come.

76
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:22,312
Bravo!

77
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:51,009
And look, there is
little Ronni Nestrud,

78
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,944
the first small baby
ever born,

79
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:57,279
and his new little sister
Ulrikke.

80
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:49,740
<i>Jorgen Asbjornsen
of the Edvardsen Institute,</i>

81
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,707
<i>himself now only
10 centimeters tall</i>

82
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,142
<i>and weighing just 18 grams,</i>

83
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,307
<i>explained the rationale
behind the invention.</i>

84
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:56,206
Wow!

85
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,275
That is wild, isn't it?
Just wild.

86
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:00,975
Say, Holly?

87
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:03,774
You can go ahead and put
the takeout order in. Thanks.

88
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,975
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

89
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,905
You hungry?

90
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,471
I ate about an hour ago.

91
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,505
I didn't know
when you were coming.

92
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,105
You knew I was bringing food.

93
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,307
I called you and asked you
specifically, and then you go and eat?

94
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,940
Just a sesame chicken!
I'm still hungry.

95
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,203
Did you see the news today?

96
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,804
- About the little Swedish man?
- Norwegian.

97
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:57,437
Helen called to tell me
to turn on the TV.

98
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,203
What won't they think of next?

99
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,471
Unbelievable.

100
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,437
Biggest thing since landing
on the moon. Bigger!

101
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,403
I don't get it.

102
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:07,736
Why would anybody
want to do that to himself?

103
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:10,337
They can shrink people down

104
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,971
and fly to Mars,

105
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:16,038
but they can't cure
my fibromyalgia?

106
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:21,370
And all this fuss
about the environment

107
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,404
as though the world's
going to end tomorrow.

108
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,702
I'm in pain.

109
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:31,038
I can't breathe!
Doesn't that matter?

110
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,504
Lots of people
are in pain, Mom,

111
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,302
in all sorts of ways.

112
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:14,333
tingling?

113
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:16,068
- More like tingling.
- Tingling, okay.

114
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,466
<i>This downsizing
thing is simply</i>

115
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,966
<i>runaway-train technology</i>

116
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:22,932
<i>that's having
a devastating impact</i>

117
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:24,701
<i>on our world economy.</i>

118
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:26,201
<i>We're losing
billions of dollars</i>

119
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,100
<i>in consumer spending already.</i>

120
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:30,600
<i>It's hurting us
in construction, automobile,</i>

121
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:31,899
<i>housing and defense.</i>

122
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:34,033
<i>And then, of course,
when we get to politics?</i>

123
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,232
<i>Israelis
shrinking Palestinians,</i>

124
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,634
<i>African dictators shrinking
rival ethnic groups.</i>

125
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,966
<i>Look, Ron, in any major
transformation of society,</i>

126
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,899
<i>are there serious
growing pains? Sure.</i>

127
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,731
<i>But at current mass
and volume,</i>

128
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,899
<i>human life on Earth
is unsustainable.</i>

129
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,066
You know, that one guy
makes a good point.

130
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,365
This family on my block
just moved away to get small.

131
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:56,134
Now their house
is just sitting there.

132
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:59,264
Making everybody's values take
a dive is what they're doing

133
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,533
and just when
I'm trying to refinance.

134
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,399
Marlene thinks I should do it
just to lose the weight.

135
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,298
You and me both, buddy.

136
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:11,032
Hey, Dee, is that
takeout order about ready?

137
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,929
Hey, honey, I brought food!

138
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,599
I'm not hungry.

139
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,965
What's wrong?

140
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,230
I have a splitting headache.

141
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,764
The store was super busy,

142
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,764
and Carla was a total bitch
on wheels.

143
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,030
I feel like
I'm going to throw up.

144
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,962
Here, let me
do the neck thing.

145
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,565
Yeah, do the
little neck thing.

146
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:42,764
Mmm.

147
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,432
Just relax, honey.

148
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,230
Let me take all the weight.

149
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,697
<i>Okay, here is the
beautiful formal living room</i>

150
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,028
with the wonderful fireplace.

151
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,828
And come around here,
and we have the

152
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,461
nice big breakfast area
for the kitchen.

153
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:01,461
Big eating area.

154
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:05,361
And this kitchen
is just a complete wow.

155
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,227
No, it's awesome.
I just think

156
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,927
maybe we should look again
at that place in Benson.

157
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,995
Come on, let's just
check out the rest.

158
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,263
This is great in here.

159
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,793
Double oven,
six-burner gas stove.

160
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,827
<i>It's got this wonderful
butler's pantry over here,</i>

161
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,562
<i>granite counter top...</i>

162
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:01,625
- Oh, hey, Sean.
- Oh, hey, Paul. How you doing?

163
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:02,626
Good.

164
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:08,195
- Do I look fat?
- No, you look very handsome.

165
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,860
Anesthesiology, huh?

166
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:16,658
My wife says I put people to
sleep even without the drugs.

167
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:19,326
I'm surprised you're still
awake.

168
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:22,259
He uses that joke
like twice a week.

169
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,890
- What's your field, Paul?
- Occupational therapy.

170
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,326
- Okay.
- Oh. Like career counseling?

171
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,357
Uh, no, it's just like
physical therapy,

172
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,323
but focused on
workplace injuries and rehab.

173
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:35,323
Repetitive stress, lower back,
that sort of thing.

174
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,057
A lot of shoulder problems.

175
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,356
I'm in-house
over at Omaha Steaks.

176
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,091
He does a lot of paperwork.

177
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,125
Yeah, well, I get a little
carpal tunnel of my own

178
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:44,692
- from time to time.
- Tell me about it.

179
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:47,822
Medicine these days is
all about covering your ass.

180
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:50,624
Hey, Paul, weren't you pre-med
down in Lincoln?

181
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,091
Good memory.
Yeah, I put in two years.

182
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,222
Then my mom got real sick,

183
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:57,923
so I moved back to Omaha
to take care of her.

184
00:14:57,926 --> 00:15:00,456
<i>I wanted to be a surgeon,
actually.</i>

185
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,090
<i>You know, we might've ended
up working together.</i>

186
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:04,788
<i>You could've been my
anesthesiologist!</i>

187
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,357
<i>- How about that?
- Yeah.</i>

188
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,690
Oh, my God. No way.

189
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:39,588
Dave?

190
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,919
That's Dave! Dave Johnson!

191
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,855
And Carol!

192
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:47,486
I heard he was coming.
I had no idea!

193
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,623
He never struck me as the kind
of guy who'd go get small.

194
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,155
Wow!

195
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,716
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

196
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:13,221
- Hope we're not intruding.
- No.

197
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:15,818
Hey, Andy?

198
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,687
Could you get Carol a...

199
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,052
Gin and tonic.

200
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:21,720
a gin and tonic.

201
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,787
With lime.

202
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,254
With lime.

203
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:26,351
<i>Well, actually,</i>

204
00:16:26,354 --> 00:16:27,918
<i>we weren't planning on coming
at all at first,</i>

205
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,720
but then, you know, we started
getting all the emails.

206
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:33,451
Plus my sister was having
a lump removed.

207
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:36,851
She's fine, thank God,
but I still needed to see her.

208
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:38,251
So what's traveling like?

209
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,318
How'd you guys get up here
from New Mexico?

210
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:41,884
Oh, gosh,
it's great! Yeah.

211
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:44,951
The airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly.

212
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,985
All the seats are first-class.

213
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,584
So, after a couple
of years in Florida,

214
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:49,783
we moved out to Vegas.

215
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:52,584
Yeah, I think that's
the last time we talked.

216
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,918
Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't
such a good choice for me,

217
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,350
as it turns out.

218
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:59,082
Got into some real bad habits.
Pretty much hit rock bottom.

219
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,884
I'll tell you, any other woman
would've run for the hills.

220
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:05,416
But Carol, man, she's a saint.
She stuck with me.

221
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,718
But I really had to come clean
about everything.

222
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,151
I mean everything.

223
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,083
You know, almost.

224
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:12,817
So the decision to...

225
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,151
Well, that's the thing.
We both needed a change.

226
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:18,349
Hit the reset button.
Start all over.

227
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:19,615
Well, plus, it must
feel good to know

228
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,415
you're really making
a difference.

229
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,615
You mean all that crap
about saving the planet?

230
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:24,482
Yeah.

231
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:27,516
Downsizing is about
saving yourself.

232
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:29,083
It takes the pressure
right off,

233
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,450
especially money pressure.

234
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:32,517
I'm just not driven
and ambitious

235
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,249
like the rest of my family.

236
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,714
And now Carol and I,
we live like kings!

237
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:39,650
I'm still living in
the same house I grew up in.

238
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:43,650
Audrey's dying for us to move,
but we're really strapped.

239
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:47,182
I mean, shit, I just finished
paying off my student loans!

240
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,382
Yeah, well...

241
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:52,316
Listen, if you ever start
thinking about it seriously,

242
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:54,182
here's my two cents.

243
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,780
There's a lot of
small communities

244
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,913
cropping up out there,

245
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:58,013
but don't mess around.

246
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,647
Leisureland's where
you want to be.

247
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,780
Best houses, best appliances,
best doctors.

248
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,445
They book all the big
concert tours.

249
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:06,013
Got all the great restaurants.

250
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:07,814
The kids love
Cheesecake Factory

251
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,079
and Leisureland's
got three of them.

252
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:13,682
And hey, I'm not just saying all this for
the referral credit, just so you know.

253
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:18,712
I liked little Carol.
She's got a lot on the ball.

254
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,047
She's reading books
she's always wanted to read,

255
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:22,480
she's taking Italian.

256
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:25,980
- And she's never been fitter.
- Well, they sure seem happy.

257
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:28,711
Dave says he's getting
pretty good on the drums.

258
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,778
Next year they're taking
the kids out of school

259
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,114
to spend six months
at a sister city in Tuscany.

260
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:36,980
Cooking classes, yoga,
wine tasting,

261
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,780
the whole nine yards.

262
00:18:42,646 --> 00:18:45,113
<i>Hi, Saf, Audrey. It's Milo.</i>

263
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,444
<i>Bad news.</i>

264
00:18:46,447 --> 00:18:49,047
<i>Your mortgage application at
First National bounced back.</i>

265
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:51,944
<i>The underwriter didn't like
the income-to-debt ratios,</i>

266
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,644
<i>they're a little excessive.</i>

267
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,278
<i>I don't know if you guys
can come up with</i>

268
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,613
<i>another ten, fifteen percent
down?</i>

269
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:59,644
<i>If you could maybe
boost it up a little bit...</i>

270
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:02,912
I bet we'll be able to tell right
away if it's for us or not.

271
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:05,311
Yeah, so let's not waste
a lot of time.

272
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,144
Maybe if we get to Santa Fe
early, we can get a massage.

273
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,744
Sounds good to me.

Welcome, everybody!

284
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,575
I'm Jeff Lonowski,
Senior Product Specialist

285
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:17,075
and happy homeowner
here at Leisureland Estates.

286
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,673
You having a good time?

287
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,209
Yeah.

288
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:24,339
Come on, guys. You're a heck
of a lot bigger than I am.

289
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,342
Make some noise!
Are you having a good time?

290
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,275
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

291
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,539
That's more like it.

292
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,539
So, what do you think
of my place?

293
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,507
Pretty nifty, huh?

294
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,173
It's the house of my dreams.

295
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,972
Heck, I'd say this is
the house of anybody's dreams!

296
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,508
Why, an average guy like me

297
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,240
would have to work 20, 30,

298
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:48,874
maybe 40 years to afford
a place like this,

299
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,338
if ever!

300
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,141
And just wait till you see
what's inside.

301
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,271
Oh!

302
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,071
Jeff!

303
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:08,672
You've got to stop inviting
guests over without telling me.

304
00:21:08,673 --> 00:21:10,373
Oh, sorry, Laura.
I was only...

305
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,538
I mean, I finally just got in the
tub to relax after such a busy day.

306
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,270
Busy doing what, sweetheart?

307
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,503
Oh, no end of things.

308
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,872
First I took a tennis lesson
and had a massage.

309
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:20,939
Nice.

310
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:23,403
And then after a gourmet lunch
with the girls,

311
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:25,069
well, we couldn't help
ourselves, so we popped

312
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:27,872
into that new Loget
jewelry store downtown.

313
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:28,703
Uh-oh.

314
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,069
Loget? What's that
gonna cost me?

315
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,503
Now, Jeff, you hush!

316
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,270
I was really good.

317
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,604
Just another diamond bracelet.

318
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:43,604
Just a diamond bracelet?
That doesn't sound like you.

319
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:46,868
You're right. I don't like
to break up a set,

320
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,769
so I got matching
diamond earrings

321
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:52,471
and a matching
diamond necklace.

322
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:55,269
All conflict free
and set in platinum.

323
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,701
How much, Laura?

324
00:21:56,703 --> 00:21:59,237
Aw, but, Jeff, they look so good
on me, and you should see...

325
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:00,769
How much, Laura?

326
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:04,201
- Well, Jeff...
- I said, how much?

327
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:05,801
Eighty-three dollars.

328
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,068
- Eighty-three dollars! Are you crazy?
- Oh!

329
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,603
Why, that's practically our
food budget for two whole months!

330
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,866
<i>Putting it all
together, if you liquidate</i>

331
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:54,634
your current home,
cars and other assets

332
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,700
and purchase
the Regency-level estate,

333
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:59,767
remember, that's the
12,000-square-foot-equivalent home

334
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,365
on the 1.5-acre-equivalent lot

335
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:04,732
at a base price of $63,000.

336
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,700
Then the health
and fitness package,

337
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,932
that's $4,500, you're going
to want to get that.

338
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:13,066
It's gym, pool, sauna, steam,
hot tub and a tennis court.

339
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,465
Then the medical procedures
for two adults,

340
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:16,767
that's $15,000.

341
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,330
Wait, does insurance cover
any of that?

342
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,798
No, but at the Regency level,

343
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,333
you qualify for
a substantial discount.

344
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,932
And don't forget
the federal tax credit.

345
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,065
- Right. Right.
- All right?

346
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,699
So, taking a look
at your current debt,

347
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,633
your retirement
and your other savings,

348
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:35,663
you are at $152,000 in equity.

349
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,397
People, that is a very
comfortable number.

350
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,597
Comfortable? That doesn't

351
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:40,999
- sound like nearly enough.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,396
No. See, you have to look
at this column, Audrey.

353
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:44,798
Equivalent value.

354
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,397
You're solidly inside
the Blue Chip zone.

355
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,396
In Leisureland, your $152,000

356
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:53,565
translates to $12.5 million.

357
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,663
To live on. For life.

358
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,665
I mean, come on!

359
00:23:57,932 --> 00:23:58,932
Wow.

360
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,998
Hold on.
If this is such a good thing,

361
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,596
how come you haven't done it?

362
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:05,462
I would do it in a heartbeat!

363
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:07,131
But my husband
had a hip replacement,

364
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,265
so he's ineligible.

365
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,863
So, what do you think?

366
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,997
Would the Regency level
be your first choice?

367
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,597
Or should I show you something
a little more deluxe?

368
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:22,128
Honey, why don't you just
go ahead and pick?

369
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,864
I just want you to be happy.

370
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,096
That's a good husband.
Take a look at this.

371
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:31,896
Hey, how much
for the hot dog cooker?

372
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,528
Four dollars?

373
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,130
I'll give you a dollar.

374
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:38,796
Sold!

375
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,362
Keep up with the exercises,
don't get lazy. Look.

376
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:43,528
I laminated it for you,

377
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,493
so you literally have
no excuse not to do it.

378
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:46,560
Okay. Thanks, Paul.

379
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:47,627
- Thanks a lot.
- You bet.

380
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,926
Maybe someday me and my wife

381
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:50,627
will get small and we'll
come down to see you.

382
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,760
Well, I'd love that,
but in the meantime...

383
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,060
- Okay?
- All right.

384
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:56,759
Just 15 minutes every night.
It'll change your life.

385
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,692
- Okay. Thanks, Paul.
- See you, Dave!

386
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:03,028
We're here to wish Paul Safranek
farewell as he moves on to Leisureland,

387
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:04,926
and we wish him nothing
but the best.

388
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:07,527
Good luck to you and Audrey.

389
00:25:07,528 --> 00:25:10,095
Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Bob.

390
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:18,728
And you guys didn't
consider Treasure Island

391
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,791
out in Palm Desert?

392
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:21,858
Well, we checked it out,
but...

393
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,960
I mean, I liked it all right,
but Audrey thought they were

394
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,461
a little stingy
with the amenities,

395
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:28,192
especially given what they were
charging in monthly maintenance.

396
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,491
And I just turned
to Paul and said,

397
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:32,858
"Okay, you win.
Let's go for it."

398
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:35,625
We're just gonna
miss you so much.

399
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:38,692
Gina, I'm gonna miss you, too.

400
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:42,027
Look, it's not like we're dying.
Okay? We're just relocating.

401
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:45,229
And we'll be back at least
once a year. Maybe more!

402
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,393
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetie.

403
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:57,789
I'm sorry your mom couldn't
bring herself to come,

404
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,290
but she sends her love,

405
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,126
and we're expecting you at the
house tomorrow afternoon.

406
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:04,625
Glad you could make it, Larry.

407
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:07,423
- Hey, Paul.
- What can I get you, Dad?

408
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,789
Um...

409
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:11,392
Look, why don't I...
Here, you guys visit, I'll...

410
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:12,588
Beer.

411
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,290
- Just any beer.
- Great. Okay, coming up.

412
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:19,557
I wish Mom weren't
taking this so hard.

413
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,288
Well, you know your mother.

414
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,391
Frankly, I was a little skeptical
about it myself at first.

415
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:27,855
Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

416
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:31,788
I called him the other day.
He and Bev retired down there.

417
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,521
Did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing.

418
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:37,990
He says they're getting
along just fine. Never better.

419
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,521
He says he feels younger
every day

420
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:42,923
and that a dollar buys a thousand
dollars' worth of stuff.

421
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:46,221
Of course, they need that with
all the medication Bev takes,

422
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:48,355
but, um, yeah.

423
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,055
No, I... I see the appeal.

424
00:26:51,057 --> 00:26:52,556
Apparently,
there's zero crime.

425
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,923
I keep telling your mother.

426
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:56,124
Yeah, it's very safe.

427
00:26:58,192 --> 00:27:00,320
We worry.

428
00:27:00,323 --> 00:27:03,422
When I was younger,
and then I lost it.

429
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,186
Hey.

430
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,453
You guys are the ones
getting small, right?

431
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:12,954
That's right.
My wife and I.

432
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,855
Good for you.

433
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:20,519
No offense, but, um,

434
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:22,385
do you think
if you're that small,

435
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:25,752
you should still have all the same rights
as the rest of us normal-sized people?

436
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:27,755
I mean,
like the right to vote?

437
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:33,119
- Why wouldn't we?
- Oh, well, jeez, let's see...

438
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:34,721
You're not buying
as many products,

439
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:36,319
you're not paying
as much sales tax.

440
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,720
Some of you aren't even
paying any income tax.

441
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,153
You're not
really participating

442
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:41,385
- in our economy, are you?
- Hey.

443
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:43,988
In fact, you're costing us
money, and jobs.

444
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,051
Hey! That's enough.

445
00:27:46,054 --> 00:27:48,385
We're just having
a good time here.

446
00:27:48,387 --> 00:27:51,252
Hey, I'm just asking a simple
academic question.

447
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,353
You know what?

448
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:53,853
You guys should have
a quarter of the vote at most.

449
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,317
That's pretty generous,
don't you think?

450
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,884
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

451
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:59,051
- Why don't you take a walk?
- Cool your jets, big guy!

452
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,384
You know what? Maybe an
eighth of a vote, in fact.

453
00:28:01,386 --> 00:28:03,519
And you could use
a little small, buddy.

454
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,886
Yeah, sit down.

455
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,550
Hey! Hey!

456
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:12,352
Can I get a normal-sized beer
for a normal-sized guy?

457
00:29:18,782 --> 00:29:21,316
I keep thinking
I forgot something.

458
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,981
Moving to town, are you?

459
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,247
How's that?

460
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,078
I see you're moving
to Leisureland.

461
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,280
You look like
a nice young couple.

462
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,778
Thanks.

463
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,047
- Where you from?
- Omaha.

464
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,646
Spokane.

465
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,280
Nervous?

466
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,077
Yeah, you know, a little.

467
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:23,280
Don't be. It's the best
thing you'll ever do.

468
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:31,278
<i>With your
permission, I'm going to</i>

469
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,912
<i>record your answers
to the following questions.</i>

470
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,743
May I begin the recording?

471
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:37,078
- Sure.
- Yeah.

472
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:42,411
Please state
your full legal names.

473
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,377
Audrey Lustig Safranek.

474
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,777
Paul Norris Safranek.

475
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:52,076
And do you,
Audrey Lustig Safranek,

476
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:55,344
and you, Paul Norris Safranek,

477
00:30:55,346 --> 00:30:56,308
understand that,

478
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,277
of your own free will,
you will undergo

479
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:01,009
the permanent and
irreversible medical procedure

480
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:03,210
commonly known as
"downsizing,"

481
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,210
and that following
the procedure

482
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:06,910
your bodies will be
approximately

483
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:10,376
0.0364 percent of their
current mass and volume?

484
00:31:11,176 --> 00:31:12,076
Yep.

485
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,910
I'm sorry, Paul,
I need a yes or no.

486
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:16,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:18,710
Great. Thank you.

488
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:23,009
And do you give full consent
to Gateway Medical Services

489
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:25,143
to administer
the medical procedure

490
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:27,076
commonly known as
"downsizing"?

491
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:29,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

492
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:32,040
And do you understand
that there exists

493
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:35,508
an approximately
one in 225,000 chance

494
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,740
that the procedure
could result in injury,

495
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:41,242
permanent disability,
or death?

496
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,075
- Yes.
- Yes.

497
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,276
Yes.

498
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:09,175
Safranek. Paul Safranek?

499
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:10,442
Yes.

500
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:21,173
- It's actually Safranek.
- Safranek.

501
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:23,506
Come with me, sir.
We're together.

502
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:27,105
Oh. Someone will escort you to
the women's facility shortly.

503
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,939
You'll be separated
for approximately five hours.

504
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:31,105
Following the procedure,

505
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,506
you'll be reunited
in the recovery room.

506
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,174
Okay.

507
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,240
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

508
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:42,174
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

509
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,106
I'll see you
on the other side.

510
00:32:48,506 --> 00:32:49,506
I love you.

511
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:51,704
I love you, too.

512
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:51,136
Okay, let's get you up here.

513
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,427
All clear!

514
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,188
Aye, we got some
real fat ones this time.

515
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,853
Hey, how's everybody
doing today?

516
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,721
Hey, Miss Joyce! Doin' good.
How you doin'?

517
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,822
Me, I'm great. Just getting
ready for the weekend.

518
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,719
I see you've decided
to join us.

519
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,519
Is this...
Is it over?

520
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,686
Welcome to Leisureland.
Can you tell me your name?

521
00:39:27,688 --> 00:39:30,619
- It's Paul Safranek.
- Okay, good.

522
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,420
I bet you're hungry.

523
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,217
Oh, my God.

524
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,751
Isn't that cute?
People just love that.

525
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,485
I'll bring you a real snack
in a moment.

526
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:47,884
Thanks.

527
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,849
Um, I think my wife is
supposed to be here with me.

528
00:39:49,851 --> 00:39:52,184
- What's her name?
- Audrey Safranek.

529
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:53,585
Let me see.

530
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:55,684
We do have an Audrey Safranek
scheduled for today,

531
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,050
but I don't show her
transferred over yet.

532
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:01,050
She's probably just held up
in dental. I'll go check.

533
00:40:01,052 --> 00:40:02,585
Okay. Thank you.

534
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,451
Mr. Safranek,
you've got a call.

535
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,449
Oh. Thank you.

536
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,849
Hello?

537
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:17,182
<i>- Paul?</i>
- Oh, Audrey. Thank God!

538
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,750
Where are you, honey?

539
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:21,548
<i>Don't be mad at me.
Please don't be mad.</i>

540
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,615
<i>It's hard enough as it is.</i>

541
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:26,016
What's hard? Wait.
What are you talking about?

542
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:29,615
<i>Oh, Paul,
they shaved my head!</i>

543
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:32,182
<i>And then they started
shaving my eyebrows,</i>

544
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:34,282
<i>and I just thought,</i>

545
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:35,949
<i>what am I doing?</i>

546
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,682
<i>I can't leave my family.
I can't leave my friends.</i>

547
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:41,516
- <i>I'm sorry, Paul, I just can't.</i>
- Where are you?

548
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,016
Are you at the airport?

549
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,615
Don't hate me.

550
00:40:48,284 --> 00:40:49,846
Please don't hate me.

551
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,447
<i>Okay, okay. Take it easy.</i>

552
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,480
Just get in a taxi
and come back

553
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,280
and we'll talk
about this, okay?

554
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:57,614
We'll go back to Omaha

555
00:40:57,615 --> 00:40:59,815
and we'll think
this through together.

556
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:04,414
Wait...

557
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:07,014
You're not leaving me here?

558
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:10,681
Can't you understand how I feel?
I feel terrible!

559
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:13,280
I let you down,
I feel awful!

560
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:15,947
But then I realized
I was just doing this because

561
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:18,746
I was trying
to make you happy,

562
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:21,612
and I should have been
thinking more about myself.

563
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:24,780
Thinking about yourself?
Thinking about yourself?

564
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,047
You know you haven't even
asked me how I am?

565
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:29,846
<i>Don't yell. Don't yell at me
or I'll hang up.</i>

566
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:34,646
Do you have any idea what
I have been through today?

567
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:37,648
Audrey, if you don't
come back here right now...

568
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:40,612
And see you all small?

569
00:41:40,614 --> 00:41:43,411
I'm upset enough already!

570
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:46,545
You're upset? You're upset?

571
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:50,213
I'm the one who's
five fucking inches tall!

572
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:54,478
I was sure sorry to hear Mrs.
Safranek couldn't make it today.

573
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,344
- Safranek.
- Safranek.

574
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:57,945
Well, it's not a half-bad idea

575
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:00,211
to scout things out and get
everything ready for her.

576
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:09,543
The net blocks
a lot of UV rays,

577
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:12,045
but you still might want
to put your hat on.

578
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:13,976
And any time you want
to go somewhere,

579
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,909
you just hop in one
of these bad boys.

580
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,510
And if they're
in short supply,

581
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:19,143
well, you can always share.

582
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:20,177
It's fun to share.

583
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:22,210
I know I've met some
super people that way.

584
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:23,677
Just super!

585
00:42:34,978 --> 00:42:37,110
Yeah. Isn't that something?

586
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:49,509
Over to your right there,

587
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,842
in that big white
oval building,

588
00:42:50,844 --> 00:42:52,641
is one of our
seven sports centers.

589
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:53,907
That's the one that houses

590
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,442
the largest indoor skiing
facility in the world.

591
00:42:56,443 --> 00:42:58,641
You know, relatively speaking.

592
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:00,876
And up ahead
we have Lake Chester.

593
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:34,907
Look familiar?

594
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:38,507
The Barrington. My sister's
got one. She loves it!

595
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:41,307
Well, sir, here is
the key to your kingdom.

596
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:43,840
Welcome to the good life.

597
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:49,440
Oh, they stock the kitchen
with standard items,

598
00:43:49,442 --> 00:43:51,706
but one thing I should
warn you about is the dairy.

599
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,105
Takes a while
for your stomach to adjust

600
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:54,971
to the milk and cheese,
so go easy on it.

601
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:56,706
Something about bacteria.

602
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,405
And be careful
about the hot water.

603
00:43:58,407 --> 00:43:59,706
It's on one central system

604
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,105
and they got that
cranked really high.

605
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:03,239
Surprised they haven't
had a lawsuit yet.

606
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,106
Oh! But you didn't
hear that from me!

607
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,572
Thanks, Matt.

608
00:44:07,574 --> 00:44:09,173
You're a nice guy.

609
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:14,005
And, Paul?

610
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:16,873
Thanks for helping the planet.

611
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:32,802
Fuck!

612
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:48,501
Safranek?

613
00:45:51,568 --> 00:45:52,967
That's me.

614
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,067
Okay!

615
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,266
<i>And now to the United States,
where for many years,</i>

616
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:16,599
<i>both the Department of
Homeland Security</i>

617
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:19,264
<i>and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service</i>

618
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:21,065
<i>have been warning
about the ease</i>

619
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,065
<i>with which downsized people,</i>

620
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:25,898
<i>from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists,</i>

621
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,998
<i>could penetrate U.S. borders.</i>

622
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,398
<i>Last week's discovery
in Eugene, Oregon,</i>

623
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,264
<i>provided new evidence
to support that claim.</i>

624
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:36,398
<i>Brian Fakler
brings us up to date.</i>

625
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,364
<i>This Target is just
one of thousands</i>

626
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,199
<i>of big box stores
around the country</i>

627
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:42,730
<i>that import almost a million
tons of goods weekly,</i>

628
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,364
<i>most of it from Asia.</i>

629
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:47,331
<i>Last week, workers here in Eugene
opened a suspicious TV box</i>

630
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,996
<i>and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from Vietnam,</i>

631
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:52,498
<i>14 of them already dead,</i>

632
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,329
<i>two more dying hours later
at a local hospital.</i>

633
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:59,697
<i>On Friday, the lone survivor,
a woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,</i>

634
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:03,096
<i>was transferred to a hospital at
Leisureland Estates in New Mexico,</i>

635
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:06,496
<i>widely considered the country's
top medical center for the small.</i>

636
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:09,630
<i>Doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg,</i>

637
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:12,862
<i>and today her condition is
described as fair but stable.</i>

638
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,096
<i>According to a statement</i>

639
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,996
<i>from the Department
of Homeland Security,</i>

640
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:17,262
<i>Miss Tran claims
to have been jailed</i>

641
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,795
<i>for her political
and environmental activism</i>

642
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:23,528
<i>and was miniaturized against her will
in a Vietnamese prison facility.</i>

643
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,460
<i>If true, this would bolster
claims by human rights groups</i>

644
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,961
<i>that repressive governments
around the world</i>

645
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:31,728
<i>are forcibly downsizing
political undesirables.</i>

646
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:43,230
So, do we need to review any
of the terms of the settlement?

647
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:44,826
No.

648
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:46,628
It's all pretty clear.

649
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,693
I really wish
you'd taken her first offer.

650
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:50,994
I know.

651
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:53,626
All right, well, if you could
just step back a little.

652
00:47:53,628 --> 00:47:55,061
Don't want you to get hurt.

653
00:48:12,894 --> 00:48:14,092
Um...

654
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,961
As large as you can, please.

655
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,559
Nice weather down here.

656
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,693
Turned real cold
back in Omaha.

657
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,427
Uh-huh.

658
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,326
Wind chill.

659
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:17,224
Hey, Paul.

660
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,623
Thanks, man.
You were right.

661
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,623
Raising my monitor
really did the trick.

662
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,255
My neck feels better, there's
no more tingling in my arm.

663
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:24,556
I would have never
made the connection.

664
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:26,755
That's great.
I'm really glad I could help.

665
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,023
Thank you for calling
Lands' End. My name is Paul.

666
00:49:33,025 --> 00:49:34,724
How can I help you today?

667
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,056
Ciao, <i>bello!</i>

668
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,188
Hi, Carol.

669
00:50:14,688 --> 00:50:15,688
Hey, pal.

670
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:18,887
Why the long face, huh?

671
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:21,222
Look around you, buddy.
Life is good!

672
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:24,387
I made a mistake, Dave.

673
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,887
Biggest mistake of my life.

674
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,653
I should've stayed
where I was.

675
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:28,688
Hey, hey, hey.

676
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,753
Look, I know divorce
can put a pretty big dent

677
00:50:30,755 --> 00:50:32,052
in anyone's self-esteem.

678
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:34,786
And what Audrey did to you
was beyond the pale.

679
00:50:34,788 --> 00:50:36,119
I mean, I hate her.

680
00:50:36,121 --> 00:50:37,451
I barely know her.

681
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,920
You may not hate her,
but I hate her guts.

682
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:42,853
You? You just got to get back
in the saddle, that's all.

683
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:44,320
Yeah, maybe someday.

684
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,018
If you want my advice,

685
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:49,286
single moms is the way to go.

686
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:51,119
They got the whole kid thing
out of their system,

687
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:52,784
and they just want to party.

688
00:50:52,786 --> 00:50:54,018
No, that's okay.

689
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:55,385
And if you don't want
an emotional connection,

690
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,351
which is understandable,
you can just...

691
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:59,251
Well, we have all sorts of
ways you can have a good time

692
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,684
down here,
no strings attached.

693
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:02,951
Just put it
on the old credit card.

694
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:04,518
No, I'm good. Really.

695
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,418
Okay, yeah.

696
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,117
In fact, I started seeing
someone.

697
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:09,751
Oh, yeah?

698
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,351
Single mom, actually.

699
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,884
Mmm-hmm.

700
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:14,951
Now we're talking!
Good for you.

701
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:24,884
Paul, this is so good.

702
00:51:24,885 --> 00:51:26,085
Thanks.

703
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,483
The recipe called for chervil,

704
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:31,949
but you can't get
chervil here yet.

705
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:33,583
- So I used dill.
- Mmm.

706
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:37,585
Well, whatever it is,
it's super yummy.

707
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:41,150
It's the little things,
you know?

708
00:51:41,152 --> 00:51:44,516
I mean, except for there being
no birds or insects,

709
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,949
you'd think we're
in the normal world.

710
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:48,916
And then something happens,
and you realize we're not.

711
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:51,983
Not that substituting dill for
chervil is that big a thing,

712
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,514
but you know what I mean.

713
00:51:53,516 --> 00:51:57,782
Like last month, my parents came
down to visit Jonah and me.

714
00:51:57,784 --> 00:52:01,014
- Mmm-hmm.
- And it's this whole production with the carrying boxes

715
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:02,581
and, of course,
Jonah gets freaked out

716
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:05,782
- by Grandma and Grandpa being so huge and scary.
- Mmm.

717
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:08,215
One night they took us out
for dinner at Fleming's.

718
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:09,780
- You know, real nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

719
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:15,248
And Jonah and I are sitting on the
table in those special seats,

720
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,780
and the big people
wouldn't stop staring at us.

721
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:20,581
Plus, the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome,

722
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:22,648
then they charge
a huge minimum!

723
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,146
They should charge
big people extra.

724
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:25,780
They're the ones
dragging down the world.

725
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,648
I know. Big people look at us
like we're freaks.

726
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,380
They're the freaks!

727
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:32,746
Oh, did you hear about
all that gas being released

728
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:34,547
in Antarctica from the ice?

729
00:52:34,548 --> 00:52:35,880
The methane?

730
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,346
I haven't really been following
the news that much lately.

731
00:52:38,347 --> 00:52:39,880
Apparently, it's a big deal.

732
00:52:39,882 --> 00:52:42,114
Scientists are saying
the more the ice melts,

733
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:43,181
the more methane comes out,

734
00:52:43,182 --> 00:52:45,313
making more ice melt.

735
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:47,878
Apparently, we're already
way beyond the tipping...

736
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:53,246
It's my upstairs neighbor.

737
00:52:53,248 --> 00:52:54,411
It's the strangest thing.

738
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,112
There wasn't
a peep for months.

739
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:57,480
I don't even
think he was here.

740
00:52:57,481 --> 00:53:01,112
And then suddenly
it's party, party, party.

741
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:03,445
I had to call security
the other night.

742
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:12,413
Dusan!

743
00:53:13,748 --> 00:53:15,213
Hey, Dusan!

744
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:17,644
Dusan!

745
00:53:17,646 --> 00:53:18,510
Yes?

746
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:19,945
You mind turning down
the music?

747
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,012
I'm trying to have
a quiet evening down here.

748
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:28,644
- Hello, my friend.
- Hello, Dusan.

749
00:53:29,246 --> 00:53:30,778
May I come in?

750
00:53:31,646 --> 00:53:32,646
Certainly.

751
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:39,443
So, listen, Pete...

752
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:40,577
Paul.

753
00:53:41,378 --> 00:53:44,010
- Paul. And Kristen.
- Paul.

754
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,943
- Ah. Hello, Kristen.
- Hi.

755
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:49,744
I'm sorry I'm disturbing
your nice little dinner.

756
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,010
Listen...

757
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,409
As I was saying, Paul,

758
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:56,342
I'm having one more, you know,

759
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:58,210
little party
at my place tonight.

760
00:53:58,211 --> 00:54:00,177
Not big like last time.
Very small.

761
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:02,878
Just a few close friends.

762
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:04,545
No!

763
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:07,076
Is that a rose?

764
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,244
- Yeah.
- A real rose?

765
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:12,909
Where'd you get a real rose?

766
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:16,309
It's a new store.
Full-Sized Flower Mart.

767
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,074
How much they
charge you for this?

768
00:54:19,076 --> 00:54:21,742
Dusan! Dusan!

769
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:37,809
Anyway,

770
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,141
as I was saying,

771
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,340
Paul, if tonight noise
disturbs you,

772
00:54:42,342 --> 00:54:43,806
just come upstairs,
talk to me.

773
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,806
Don't make big show
like last time,

774
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:47,706
yelling like crazy man.

775
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:50,273
We're neighbors.
Neighbors are friends.

776
00:54:50,275 --> 00:54:53,007
What's better even,
come to the party.

777
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:54,606
Thanks, but like I said,

778
00:54:54,608 --> 00:54:57,605
we just want to have
a quiet dinner.

779
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:00,072
Just try to
keep it down, okay?

780
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:03,273
Yes, darling. Of course.

781
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:13,539
Thanks for a really nice time.

782
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:15,105
Plus the cooking and all.

783
00:55:15,106 --> 00:55:17,806
Sorry I have to leave so early,
but, you know, the sitter.

784
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:20,474
Yeah! Yeah, no, I...

785
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:27,405
Up one floor.

786
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,572
Yeah, one more.

787
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:29,873
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

788
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,838
Anyway, uh...

789
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,972
I was hoping Sunday
we could bring Jonah.

790
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:42,771
I'd love to meet him.

791
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,039
Yeah. Maybe.

792
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:02,538
- Is something wrong?
- No.

793
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:05,903
You're a wonderful guy, Paul,

794
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:08,771
and I really enjoy
hanging out with you.

795
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:10,802
Uh-huh.

796
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:13,668
But if I'm honest
about how I'm feeling,

797
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,936
it might be too soon for me.

798
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:17,269
It's fine, I get it.

799
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:18,836
- No...
- I get it. No, it's fine.

800
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,036
I just mean if we're
bringing Jonah into it.

801
00:56:22,038 --> 00:56:23,768
Have a nice night.

802
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:24,769
No, uh...

803
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:26,503
Paul!

804
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,135
A rose!

805
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:12,936
Paul!

806
00:57:14,867 --> 00:57:16,534
You come!

807
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:18,534
And you bring the rose.

808
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,534
As a peace offering.

809
00:57:21,202 --> 00:57:22,599
Oh! Look, everyone!

810
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:26,099
This is Paul, my neighbor,
and look at what he brings me.

811
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:27,599
A real fucking rose!

812
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:31,833
Do you think any of these other
ungrateful sons of bitches

813
00:57:31,835 --> 00:57:33,932
think to bring
something to Dusan?

814
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:36,900
No. You're the only one.
I like you.

815
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:40,632
Look, I know I said
it's only a little party,

816
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:44,297
but I make two, three phone calls to
very close friends, look what happens.

817
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:45,965
Everybody comes!

818
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:50,266
There's nothing else to do in
this fucking city after 10:00.

819
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:53,063
Now, this I do not understand.

820
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:56,465
It's not as if so many people
have work in the morning.

821
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:59,298
This is the worst trait
about small people.

822
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,596
They're lazy.

823
00:58:00,597 --> 00:58:03,264
Not all. Not all. But lazy.

824
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:06,798
Like this lazy son of a bitch.

825
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:08,764
Konrad.

826
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:10,697
What's that you're
saying about me?

827
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:12,431
What lies are you telling?

828
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:15,030
Just that in small world
no one wants to work!

829
00:58:15,032 --> 00:58:16,297
What did you expect?

830
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:19,329
That's the wonderful thing
about becoming small.

831
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:21,130
Because you're
immediately rich.

832
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:25,530
Unless you're very poor.
Then you're just small.

833
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:28,764
- Konrad is sea captain.
- Oh.

834
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:31,498
Never more than ten meters
away from his boat.

835
00:58:32,398 --> 00:58:34,264
I do like my boat.

836
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:39,695
There she is.
<i>Sonja,</i> my beauty.

837
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:43,663
You see, I'm from
many generations,

838
00:58:43,664 --> 00:58:45,862
all the way back
to my grandfathers,

839
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:47,797
my father, all sea captains.

840
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,862
So, what brings you
to Leisureland?

841
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:52,760
Dusan.

842
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,628
He even convinced me
to become small.

843
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,494
Mostly for the women
and the parties.

844
00:58:59,496 --> 00:59:00,860
And, frankly,

845
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:03,262
my wife had all the money.

846
00:59:03,264 --> 00:59:06,960
And after she left,
things became a bit tricky.

847
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,393
I can relate.

848
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:12,793
It's quite wonderful
to be small, don't you think?

849
00:59:12,795 --> 00:59:15,628
I'd say it has its pluses
and minuses.

850
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,293
Next week I'll be
in the Seychelles.

851
00:59:18,295 --> 00:59:19,793
And two weeks after that,

852
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:23,626
I'll be sailing with friends
for a month on Lake Titicaca.

853
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:27,027
Can you believe I've never
been to Lake Titicaca?

854
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:29,494
And how does the boat
get from place to place?

855
00:59:29,496 --> 00:59:31,360
I mean, you can't sail it.

856
00:59:31,362 --> 00:59:33,826
FedEx, my dear boy.

857
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:37,059
<i>Sonja</i> travels
faster than I do!

858
00:59:56,293 --> 00:59:58,958
How'd you get
a tiny harpsichord down here?

859
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,992
I didn't.
I had to have it made.

860
01:00:00,994 --> 01:00:02,027
Wow.

861
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:09,557
Who is that?

862
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,490
- Who's that?
- Yeah.

863
01:00:11,492 --> 01:00:13,358
That's Little Ronni.

864
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,625
That's Little Ronni?

865
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:17,023
The first small baby
ever born, back in Norway.

866
01:00:17,025 --> 01:00:19,757
Holy shit,
that's Little Ronni!

867
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:21,692
Yeah. You should go
talk to him.

868
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,358
Sorry, uh... Sorry, excuse me.

869
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,757
Is it true
you're Little Ronni?

870
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:33,724
Well, maybe not
so little anymore,

871
01:00:33,726 --> 01:00:35,224
but, yeah, that's me.

872
01:00:35,826 --> 01:00:37,056
Wow!

873
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:39,655
- Would it be cool to get a selfie?
- Yeah, man. Get in here.

874
01:00:39,657 --> 01:00:40,722
Awesome. Thank you so much.

875
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,023
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

876
01:00:43,592 --> 01:00:45,389
Wow.

877
01:01:32,257 --> 01:01:34,123
Thank you, so are you.

878
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:47,753
What is that?

879
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:56,420
No, I need to know.
I have allergies.

880
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,420
Wait! Wait.

881
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,786
Okay.

882
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,384
I'm gonna take off my shoes.

883
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,347
Having fun?

884
01:05:00,144 --> 01:05:04,010
Enough with the
fucking doorbell.

885
01:05:05,612 --> 01:05:06,942
Good morning,
Mr. Dusan.

886
01:05:06,943 --> 01:05:09,010
We come clean for you.

887
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:33,208
<i>So you had
fun last night, yeah?</i>

888
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:34,842
You didn't know
you were so lucky

889
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:37,474
to have exciting neighbors
such as me.

890
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:39,742
Well, I've never been
to a party like that.

891
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:41,742
There were so many Europeans.

892
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:45,574
Did you know Little Ronni was
here? I mean, he is historic!

893
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:47,242
And boring.

894
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,876
Good-looking
dumb Norwegian guy

895
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,509
goes around the world
having sex with everyone.

896
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,641
Women, men, hermaphrodites,

897
01:05:53,643 --> 01:05:56,041
dogs, goats, monkeys.

898
01:05:56,043 --> 01:05:58,775
He'll be the first small baby
to die of syphilis.

899
01:05:58,777 --> 01:06:01,940
But, yeah, okay, historic.

900
01:06:01,942 --> 01:06:03,240
Well, apparently,
he still lives

901
01:06:03,242 --> 01:06:05,340
in the original colony,
you know, over in Norway.

902
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:07,141
I've always wanted
to see that.

903
01:06:07,143 --> 01:06:08,608
It's all right.

904
01:06:09,543 --> 01:06:11,039
You've been there?

905
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:13,708
Yeah. I go once
or twice a year.

906
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,507
Konrad, too.
We make business there.

907
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:18,007
Very good business.

908
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:19,440
Must be something to see.

909
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,773
You know you can't even get
pictures of it online?

910
01:06:21,775 --> 01:06:27,440
Yes, my friend. The world
is filled with things to see.

911
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,806
I don't know you, Paul,
but I like you.

912
01:06:29,807 --> 01:06:31,005
I like you very much.

913
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:32,706
And my advice is,

914
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:37,907
get out of this disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes.

915
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:39,873
Don't be so American.

916
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,206
You're nice guy, Paul.

917
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,838
But you're a little bit
pathetic guy.

918
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,938
Last night you dance,
you laugh,

919
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,306
but inside you cry.

920
01:06:49,974 --> 01:06:52,106
Who are you to
talk to me that way?

921
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,239
I'm Dusan Mirkovic,
your neighbor.

922
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,637
Neighbors are friends.

923
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,304
Friends tell friends
the truth.

924
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:02,103
Okay, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit asshole,

925
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:04,038
but the world needs assholes.

926
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:06,273
Otherwise where would
shit go out?

927
01:07:07,672 --> 01:07:09,403
Dusan, bye.

928
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:11,005
Thank you.

929
01:07:16,141 --> 01:07:18,936
When I think of
big people becoming small,

930
01:07:18,938 --> 01:07:20,536
all the new small cities
in the world,

931
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,637
I see opportunity.

932
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,969
I ask myself, "Dusan,

933
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:27,903
"why do people,
they want to become small?"

934
01:07:27,905 --> 01:07:30,436
To help the environment?
Please!

935
01:07:30,438 --> 01:07:32,869
They become small
to have the things

936
01:07:32,871 --> 01:07:34,702
which until now
were only for the rich.

937
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:38,202
Which, by the way,
is the genius of the concept.

938
01:07:38,204 --> 01:07:40,936
So I say to
my brother, Srdan...

939
01:07:40,938 --> 01:07:42,735
I work with my brother.

940
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:44,070
He's still big.

941
01:07:44,072 --> 01:07:46,336
My wife, too, by the way.

942
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:50,268
I say, "Why not bring
very special items,

943
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:53,402
"luxury items,
to the small consumer?"

944
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:56,603
The things that nobody else
is thinking to bring.

945
01:07:57,438 --> 01:07:58,735
Such as?

946
01:07:58,737 --> 01:08:04,201
Well, Cohiba Esplendido. Cuba.
Best cigar in the world.

947
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:06,534
How much you pay for this
when you're big?

948
01:08:06,536 --> 01:08:08,436
45, 50 dollars?

949
01:08:08,438 --> 01:08:12,668
When you're small, I sell you
this cigar for one dollar.

950
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:17,198
And from this one Cohiba,
we make about 2,000 cigars.

951
01:08:17,201 --> 01:08:20,466
Okay, maybe they're not
actually made in Cuba.

952
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,765
Maybe they're rolled
by little Albanians

953
01:08:22,768 --> 01:08:24,932
in Bujanovac, but who cares?

954
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:26,801
And this is just one thing.

955
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,466
There's perfume and cologne,

956
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:33,765
brandy, port, Calvados,
truffles, caviar.

957
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:35,435
Is all that legal?

958
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:39,332
Baby, this is Wild West.

959
01:08:39,335 --> 01:08:40,600
Who has time chasing after

960
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:43,564
some fucking Serbian guy
five inches tall

961
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:46,466
over a few cigars
and some wine?

962
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:50,099
My brother and I
are now in seven small cities

963
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,666
around the world. Seven!

964
01:08:53,134 --> 01:08:55,198
Paul, listen.

965
01:08:55,201 --> 01:08:56,798
Anything you want,
I can get for you.

966
01:08:56,801 --> 01:08:58,064
Anything, anytime.

967
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,533
Excuse me a minute.

968
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:14,733
Hello.

969
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,634
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

970
01:09:23,032 --> 01:09:25,765
"Na-pro-sien."
What this do?

971
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,997
Naproxen. It's an
anti-inflammatory.

972
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:39,898
- It's for pain and swelling.
- Ah.

973
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:47,131
And this one?
What this one do?

974
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:50,729
Well, Vicodin.
That's also a painkiller.

975
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:53,430
But you want to be really
careful with that one.

976
01:09:53,431 --> 01:09:55,497
Painkiller? Painkiller good.

977
01:09:55,498 --> 01:09:58,828
Listen. This is not
my apartment,

978
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:01,028
and I'm sure you're probably
in a lot of pain,

979
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:03,563
but you shouldn't steal pills.

980
01:10:03,564 --> 01:10:05,162
I no steal.

981
01:10:05,163 --> 01:10:06,528
They too old, no good.

982
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:09,863
Mr. Dusan, he say me okay
I take away thing.

983
01:10:09,864 --> 01:10:11,863
Pill for sick friend.

984
01:10:19,329 --> 01:10:22,395
Okay. I finish now.
Bathroom clean.

985
01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:27,560
Well, whatever's wrong
with your "friend,"

986
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:30,493
I can see that you have a really,
really bad prosthetic foot.

987
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:33,229
I'm sure it's causing you pain
in your right hip and knee,

988
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,493
probably your other knee,
your lower back.

989
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:40,027
How you know these thing?
You a doctor?

990
01:10:40,029 --> 01:10:41,628
Occupational therapist.

991
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,859
Wait a minute. I know you.

992
01:10:47,162 --> 01:10:48,827
You're the... Oh, my God!

993
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,960
You're that woman from
a couple years ago,

994
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:52,158
the dissident,

995
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:55,460
from Thailand or something?
What's your name?

996
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:57,693
Tran Ngoc Lan. Vietnam.

997
01:10:57,694 --> 01:11:01,359
Tran Ngoc Lan from Vietnam.
Yes, that's right!

998
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,992
And I remember that you lost
your leg below the knee.

999
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:06,759
That's... That's you.

1000
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:07,994
Wow.

1001
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:13,158
Dusan...

1002
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:15,559
Hey, do you know
who this is here?

1003
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,826
Of course. The famous
Ngoc Lan Tran.

1004
01:11:17,828 --> 01:11:19,893
Dramatic escape
from Vietnamese prison,

1005
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:23,226
almost died so now
she can clean my house.

1006
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:27,259
America. Big land
of opportunity!

1007
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:34,890
Push up. Push again.
Push, push, push.

1008
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:37,890
Okay, that's it. Now take your
heel back towards you.

1009
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:39,725
Even harder if you can.

1010
01:11:39,726 --> 01:11:40,826
Even... Yeah.

1011
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:42,358
Yeah.

1012
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:44,355
Put your hand right here.

1013
01:11:44,358 --> 01:11:45,423
Feel that, okay?

1014
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,823
Feel that crunching?
You hear it?

1015
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:50,957
That's arthritis.
That's already pretty bad.

1016
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:52,288
Paul?

1017
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,858
You're full of surprises.

1018
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:57,423
You can do this, but you work
shit job answering phones?

1019
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:59,355
When I moved down here,
I didn't think I'd be working,

1020
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:00,756
so I let my license expire,

1021
01:12:00,757 --> 01:12:03,555
and now I'd have to get it
in a whole other state.

1022
01:12:03,557 --> 01:12:04,856
It's a boring story.

1023
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:08,988
I hate to say it,

1024
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,488
but if you don't do
something pretty soon,

1025
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,189
you're going to need
a new knee.

1026
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:13,822
Maybe even a new hip.

1027
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,189
You've got to go to a
specialist as soon as you can

1028
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,389
and get a whole new foot.

1029
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,721
In the meantime,

1030
01:12:18,724 --> 01:12:21,090
I could make some adjustments
on the existing prosthetic

1031
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,755
and maybe give you some
pointers on how to walk better.

1032
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,889
I just hate to see you needlessly
suffer after all you've been through.

1033
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,689
Okay. I finish work,
you come with me.

1034
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:32,354
No, I could get my tools.
I can do it right here.

1035
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:35,689
No. I say you before.
My friend sick, need pill.

1036
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,354
You come with me my house,
help her.

1037
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:40,255
You help her.

1038
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:42,055
I don't think I was clear.

1039
01:12:42,056 --> 01:12:44,752
I can help you with this,
but I'm not a doctor,

1040
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:46,453
so your friend,
whatever's wrong with her,

1041
01:12:46,454 --> 01:12:48,386
she's got to go to a clinic
or a hospital.

1042
01:12:48,389 --> 01:12:49,555
No! Clinic no good.

1043
01:12:49,556 --> 01:12:51,520
I bring her clinic,
wait too long time.

1044
01:12:51,523 --> 01:12:54,886
Stupid doctor say no help for
her. No do nothing!

1045
01:12:54,889 --> 01:12:59,154
He no good stupid doctor
in big world, now he small.

1046
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:01,287
You come with me.

1047
01:13:01,288 --> 01:13:03,021
You come with me now.

1048
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:04,788
Uh...

1049
01:13:06,956 --> 01:13:08,021
Come.

1050
01:13:25,753 --> 01:13:28,720
- You live near here?
- No, still far.

1051
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:32,020
Maybe we should grab a car.

1052
01:13:32,887 --> 01:13:35,020
No need car. Take bus.

1053
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:49,685
If you don't
mind my asking,

1054
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:51,652
you were so famous
a couple years ago.

1055
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,716
I mean, everybody
was talking about you.

1056
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:55,685
I just would've thought
you would be

1057
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:58,216
giving speeches
or writing books.

1058
01:13:58,219 --> 01:14:00,884
How'd you wind up
cleaning houses?

1059
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:02,817
Need money for live.

1060
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:05,751
After TV box,
I stay hospital so long time.

1061
01:14:05,752 --> 01:14:06,917
Almost die.

1062
01:14:06,918 --> 01:14:09,817
Then three host family.
But too much problem.

1063
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,617
Leisureland people
too selfish.

1064
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:13,451
Better I live only me,
work job,

1065
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,085
make money. Easy.

1066
01:15:36,047 --> 01:15:38,514
Hey! You! Come!

1067
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:40,180
Come!

1068
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:44,710
You!

1069
01:16:44,712 --> 01:16:47,645
Come on! No time
for baby dream.

1070
01:16:50,043 --> 01:16:52,310
May I ask how high
we're going?

1071
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:54,310
- Seven floor.
- Seven?

1072
01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:57,578
- Can we use the elevator?
- No elevator.

1073
01:17:26,507 --> 01:17:27,974
Take the shoe.

1074
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:35,274
<i>Hola,</i> Gladys.

1075
01:17:39,608 --> 01:17:42,140
This lady Gladys.
Gladys my friend.

1076
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:43,538
She very sick.

1077
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:45,439
Gladys, how you feel?

1078
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,105
<i>Como estas? Como estas?</i>

1079
01:17:48,108 --> 01:17:49,639
I bring food for you.

1080
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,904
I bring doctor.

1081
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:00,573
This lady Gladys alone.
No have nobody.

1082
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:02,840
Husband die Mexico

1083
01:18:02,841 --> 01:18:05,337
Stupid people forget take
the gold from the teeth.

1084
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,573
Head explode.

1085
01:18:06,574 --> 01:18:09,439
- What?
- Husband head explode.

1086
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,505
Head explode! From teeth.

1087
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:14,270
She come alone, no money.

1088
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,072
I meet her, she housekeeper

Okay, you take care for her.

1091
01:18:26,372 --> 01:18:28,171
I can't do anything for her.

1092
01:18:28,172 --> 01:18:31,770
That woman is really sick.
It looks like she might die!

1093
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:33,636
Oh, yeah, she die soon.

1094
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:36,237

Most bad thing die alone.

1096
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,805
Come on. Be like doctor.

1097
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,137
Make her feel good.

1098
01:19:08,003 --> 01:19:09,703
<i>Hola, senora.</i>

01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:21,270

01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:54,801
<i>Gracias,</i> doctor.

1110
01:19:57,735 --> 01:19:59,867
Have you tried to
move her every couple hours,

1111
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:01,935
so she doesn't get bedsores?

1112
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:05,069
We should probably do that.

1113
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:09,265
Go. There you go. Okay.

1114
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:11,368
See? You know thing.

1115
01:20:18,801 --> 01:20:22,332
Thank you, Mr. Dusan friend.
You help Gladys good.

1116
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,599
Okay. Well,

1117
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,997
let's make those adjustments.

1118
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,899
If you just want to
slip off your foot.

1119
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,765
No, no foot. I tired.

1120
01:20:29,766 --> 01:20:33,163
You go away. I stay with
Gladys, you go away now.

1121
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:35,765
- Really? I mean...
- I tired. You go away.

1122
01:20:35,766 --> 01:20:36,932
Okay.

1123
01:20:36,935 --> 01:20:39,198
Some other time, I guess.

1124
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,065
I just don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

1125
01:20:43,132 --> 01:20:45,796
Thursday.
You come Thursday, okay?

1126
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:48,997
- Thursday morning
you come fix leg. -00.

1127
01:20:51,798 --> 01:20:53,798
Thursday at 10:00.

1128
01:20:58,797 --> 01:21:02,463
My name's Paul, by the way.
Paul Safranek.

1129
01:21:11,765 --> 01:21:13,462
<i>Let's see...</i>

1130
01:21:13,465 --> 01:21:15,796
The extra-large
is available in

1131
01:21:15,797 --> 01:21:21,162
glacier, pebble, tulip,
cayenne, moss and aubergine.

1132
01:21:21,163 --> 01:21:24,662
<i>Cayenne?
Is that like red?</i>

1133
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:28,429
It's... It's a brownish red.
It's more like brick.

1134
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:30,828
<i>No, I don't like brick.</i>

1135
01:21:30,829 --> 01:21:33,162
<i>Do you think moss is pretty?</i>

1136
01:21:33,163 --> 01:21:34,929
You know, I don't know, lady.

1137
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:37,162
Why don't you just
pick a color, please?

1138
01:21:37,163 --> 01:21:39,560
<i>Don't be short with me!</i>

1139
01:21:39,563 --> 01:21:41,694
What did you say?

1140
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:54,163
Hi.

1141
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:57,229
Shoe.

1142
01:22:00,695 --> 01:22:02,095
Where's Gladys?

1143
01:22:02,462 --> 01:22:03,894
Oh, she die.

1144
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:05,327
No. Oh...

1145
01:22:05,328 --> 01:22:06,859
I'm so sorry.

1146
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:09,194
I think maybe
I give her too much pill.

1147
01:22:09,195 --> 01:22:12,061
Anyway, she die very happy,
smiling.

1148
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,494
- Okay, you fix foot now.
- What?

1149
01:22:19,427 --> 01:22:20,960
You do quick.

1150
01:22:20,962 --> 01:22:24,560
Must clean house soon,
one hour. You do quick.

1151
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:27,228
Quick!

1152
01:22:33,293 --> 01:22:34,359
Oh.

1153
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,826
Thank you, very nice.

1154
01:22:35,828 --> 01:22:38,827
You finish soon, okay?
I very busy.

1155
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:40,293
I'm getting there.

1156
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:49,125
I guess you like butterflies.

1157
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:51,992
Butterflies?

1158
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:54,724
Yes, I like very much.

1159
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:56,689
When I little girl, my father,

1160
01:22:56,692 --> 01:22:59,823
he take me,
my sister go see butterfly.

1161
01:22:59,826 --> 01:23:02,358
Near my village
they live in the tree.

1162
01:23:02,759 --> 01:23:04,157
You know,

1163
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:08,256
they fly cold place
to hot place every year.

1164
01:23:08,259 --> 01:23:10,926
Stay tree,
then go away, come back.

1165
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:14,323
Migrating butterflies.

1166
01:23:14,324 --> 01:23:16,391
- Yes.
- That sounds beautiful.

1167
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:19,590
How do you say "butterfly"
in Vietnamese?

1168
01:23:30,057 --> 01:23:31,988
You miss your village?

1169
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,654
No more village.

1170
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:37,189
Government make the people
go away, put water all over.

1171
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,823
All over everywhere!
Too much water.

1172
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:41,220
Too much water?

1173
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:43,689
Big water
for make electricity.

1174
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,823
Oh, a dam.

1175
01:23:44,824 --> 01:23:47,289
Yes, dam. They make dam.

1176
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:50,720
Many village no more.

1177
01:23:50,722 --> 01:23:52,921
That's why I go prison.

1178
01:23:52,923 --> 01:23:55,787
Me, my sister make protest.

1179
01:23:55,788 --> 01:23:57,956
- Big protest.
- Uh-huh.

1180
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:01,123
Well, where's your sister now?

1181
01:24:02,523 --> 01:24:04,456
She die prison.

1182
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:13,322
Too cold, chest fill up bad.
She die.

1183
01:24:27,654 --> 01:24:29,587
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1184
01:24:31,621 --> 01:24:33,121
Just give me a minute.

1185
01:24:33,122 --> 01:24:35,853
- What you do?
- No, nothing, nothing.

1186
01:24:35,854 --> 01:24:37,287
You stupid man!

1187
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:39,685
You needed a new foot anyway.
We'll get you a good one.

1188
01:24:39,688 --> 01:24:41,118
Is that so hard to understand?

1189
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,920
- Jesus!
- No say Jesus bad way.

1190
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:45,886
Now I'm supposed to
watch my language?

1191
01:24:45,887 --> 01:24:47,319
You're worse than my mother.

1192
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,952
I feel sorry for your mother.

1193
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:51,652
I sure she suffer too much
for your fault.

1194
01:24:56,587 --> 01:24:58,417
Not do so fast!

1195
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:01,819
Vacuum cleaner need time
same direction clean good.

1196
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:13,085
And you can take these.

1197
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:16,585
These are samosas
from a couple of days ago.

1198
01:25:16,587 --> 01:25:19,350
Thank you, yes.
I take all these.

1199
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:21,783
Oh!
I think this is saag paneer.

1200
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,717
It might be a little bit old.

1201
01:25:25,985 --> 01:25:27,384
Oh...

1202
01:25:27,386 --> 01:25:30,185
In prison we die
for such food.

1203
01:25:33,552 --> 01:25:36,015
Okay. Not too many leftover
entrees today,

1204
01:25:36,018 --> 01:25:37,685
but I threw in lots
of baked potato soup.

1205
01:25:38,485 --> 01:25:39,917
Thank you, Roger.

1206
01:25:39,918 --> 01:25:41,751
There you go.

1207
01:25:41,752 --> 01:25:44,783
Hey, you finally got yourself
a helper, huh, Ngoc Lan?

1208
01:25:44,784 --> 01:25:47,251
This Paul. He break my foot.

1209
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:50,416
How'd you manage
that, buddy?

1210
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:51,980
It's a long story.
We're sorting it out.

1211
01:25:51,983 --> 01:25:53,881
He stupid!

1212
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:07,247
<i>Hola, Señor</i> Cardenas.

1213
01:26:25,615 --> 01:26:28,382
Okay.
Over here. This way.

1214
01:26:36,815 --> 01:26:38,648
Oh, that looks really painful.

1215
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:46,314
I bet that's ringworm,

1216
01:26:46,315 --> 01:26:47,747
which I don't know
how to say in Spanish.

1217
01:26:47,748 --> 01:26:52,279
But ringworm is a fungus,
so you want it dry.

1218
01:26:55,346 --> 01:26:57,380
And I'll see
if I can pick something up

1219
01:26:57,381 --> 01:26:59,212
at the drugstore
and bring it for him tomorrow.

1220
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:00,746
Yes, you bring.

1221
01:27:05,014 --> 01:27:06,412
Okay, next. Let's go.

1222
01:27:07,712 --> 01:27:09,846
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.

1223
01:27:13,945 --> 01:27:15,078
Take care for him.

1224
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:16,479
- See you next time.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1225
01:27:18,279 --> 01:27:20,078
So that's it?
We go home now?

1226
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:22,711
Now we go church pray Jesus.

1227
01:27:52,212 --> 01:27:54,944
You come back tomorrow,
pick me up 8:00.

1228
01:27:54,945 --> 01:27:56,811
Yeah, okay, I'll be here.

1229
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,176
Good morning,
Mr. Dusan.

1230
01:28:08,177 --> 01:28:09,810
We come clean for you.

1231
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:33,240
Answering telephones was not
dignified enough for you.

1232
01:28:33,243 --> 01:28:35,809
Now you progress
to cleaning toilets.

1233
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,605
I love you, Paul.

1234
01:28:37,608 --> 01:28:40,872
I really love you.
You're such a funny guy.

1235
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:42,207
Hilarious.

1236
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:46,108
Like I said,
you're too much a nice guy

1237
01:28:46,109 --> 01:28:48,640
and a little bit pathetic guy.

1238
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:50,640
It's just until
she gets a new foot.

1239
01:28:50,641 --> 01:28:53,238
- When will that be?
- I don't know. The doctor said

1240
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:54,774
a month, maybe six weeks.

1241
01:28:54,775 --> 01:28:57,140
- That's an eternity.
- I know!

1242
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:58,908
Meantime, she's stuck
with a peg leg,

1243
01:28:58,909 --> 01:29:01,173
which is almost as bad as
having nothing at all.

1244
01:29:01,176 --> 01:29:02,340
I mean, look at her!

1245
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:05,073
She's waddling around
like a goddamn pirate.

1246
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,671
Paul! You no talk
with Mr. Dusan.

1247
01:29:08,673 --> 01:29:10,774
You go upstair
with Veronica.

1248
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:14,006
- Paul!
- I heard you.

1249
01:29:14,007 --> 01:29:15,673
Don't worry, Paul.

1250
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:20,340
Dusan will save you.

1251
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:33,006
Wow.

1252
01:29:34,573 --> 01:29:36,972
Yeah, Miss Tran,
take everything.

1253
01:29:38,704 --> 01:29:41,604
Mr. Konrad and I are
leaving day after tomorrow

1254
01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:43,904
and don't know
when we'll be back.

1255
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:46,837
Okay, good. Thank you.

1256
01:29:46,838 --> 01:29:49,037
Paul, Mr. Dusan say
I take all the food.

1257
01:29:49,038 --> 01:29:51,037
You go find me big box.

1258
01:29:51,038 --> 01:29:52,305
In a minute.

1259
01:29:52,306 --> 01:29:55,006
First there's something
very important to discuss.

1260
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:58,171
Me?

1261
01:29:58,172 --> 01:30:00,438
This is the situation.

1262
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:02,502
I don't know exactly what,

1263
01:30:02,503 --> 01:30:04,569
but something big, very big,

1264
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:07,304
is happening
at the original small colony.

1265
01:30:07,305 --> 01:30:09,670
You know, the one in Norway.

1266
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:11,470
They want me
to go there right away

1267
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:14,104
with a very important
delivery.

1268
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:15,537
It's too complicated
to explain.

1269
01:30:15,538 --> 01:30:18,403
Top secret and very urgent,

1270
01:30:18,404 --> 01:30:23,769
but most important, they are
offering us very big money.

1271
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:25,036
Very big.

1272
01:30:25,037 --> 01:30:26,702
And that means

1273
01:30:26,703 --> 01:30:30,804
we need extra help to do this
quickly, make them happy

1274
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:33,536
and, I'm sorry to say, we need
the same excellent helper

1275
01:30:33,537 --> 01:30:35,569
who's currently helping you.

1276
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:37,036
Him.

1277
01:30:37,037 --> 01:30:38,368
That's right, Ngoc Lan.

1278
01:30:38,371 --> 01:30:40,970
I have to go with
these guys to Norway.

1279
01:30:43,302 --> 01:30:46,002
So you say

1280
01:30:46,003 --> 01:30:48,902
Paul go with you Norway?

1281
01:30:48,904 --> 01:30:50,902
That's the situation.

1282
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,703
- Emergency situation!
- And deeply humanitarian.

1283
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:57,768
I mean,
Ngoc Lan, I will

1284
01:30:57,770 --> 01:31:00,466
be able to help
when I get back 100%,

1285
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:02,335
and when you get
the new foot, and...

1286
01:31:02,337 --> 01:31:03,936
You leave Wednesday?

1287
01:31:04,335 --> 01:31:05,533
Yes.

1288
01:31:06,636 --> 01:31:08,502
And how long you go?

1289
01:31:11,636 --> 01:31:13,833
Ten days, maybe more.

1290
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,801
Okay. Yes, Norway.

1291
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:24,001
I go Norway, too.

1292
01:31:24,002 --> 01:31:26,265
No, no, no. Not you.

1293
01:31:26,268 --> 01:31:27,800
Only Paul.

1294
01:31:27,801 --> 01:31:30,734
I go Norway, too.
Paul, you help me on the trip.

1295
01:31:32,201 --> 01:31:33,399
But you're very busy here

1296
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,365
with humanitarian activities
on your own.

1297
01:31:36,368 --> 01:31:38,497
And your cleaning business!

1298
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,230
Veronica and other ladies
know every place.

1299
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:42,899
They do for me,
I pay them good.

1300
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,965
No problem I go.

1301
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,765
Norway colony people
invite me so many time,

1302
01:31:47,766 --> 01:31:49,230
but I never go.

1303
01:31:49,233 --> 01:31:51,632
Feel so, so guilty!

1304
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:54,500
They so nice people.

1305
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:56,465
What?

1306
01:31:56,466 --> 01:31:58,132
Who invited you?

1307
01:31:59,565 --> 01:32:03,166
When I hospital so long time
after TV box,

1308
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:05,363
people all over world

1309
01:32:05,365 --> 01:32:08,997
send me happy card,
flower, candy.

1310
01:32:08,998 --> 01:32:10,597
Make me feel good.

1311
01:32:11,131 --> 01:32:12,529
So many letter.

1312
01:32:12,532 --> 01:32:15,398
One letter very special
I never forget.

1313
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:17,865
From Jorgen Asbjornsen.

1314
01:32:19,398 --> 01:32:21,963
You got a letter
from Jorgen Asbjornsen?

1315
01:32:22,664 --> 01:32:25,462
Dr. Asbjornsen write me.

1316
01:32:25,465 --> 01:32:30,064
Say he feel so, so bad
I suffer for he fault.

1317
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:33,662
He say he painful.

1318
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,664
He never think
make small so bad for people.

1319
01:32:38,131 --> 01:32:41,497
Dr. Asbjornsen letter
make me feel so good,

1320
01:32:41,498 --> 01:32:42,996
I write letter, too.

1321
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:46,595
Say now first time
I happy be small.

1322
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:52,863
He say me make trip
go Norway any day.

1323
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,929
But I too busy.

1324
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:56,961
Always too busy.

1325
01:32:56,962 --> 01:33:00,929
Now Jesus give me special gift
go Norway.

1326
01:33:03,197 --> 01:33:06,796
Thank you, Mr. Dusan.
Thank you, Mr. Konrad.

1327
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:11,862
Yes. I go Norway, too.

1328
01:33:11,863 --> 01:33:13,728
So happy!

1329
01:33:13,729 --> 01:33:16,061
Thank you special time.

1330
01:35:16,523 --> 01:35:17,953
Paul, look.

1331
01:35:17,956 --> 01:35:21,155
This Jorgen Asbjornsen
and he wife.

1332
01:35:22,823 --> 01:35:25,889
Oh, my God.
Jorgen Asbjornsen?

1333
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:28,488
Hello.

1334
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:31,586
- It's just such an honor.
- Hello, hello.

1335
01:35:31,587 --> 01:35:32,854
See, Paul?

1336
01:35:33,389 --> 01:35:34,953
Jesus smile for me.

1337
01:35:34,954 --> 01:35:38,088
I say Paul I want visit Norway
only for meet you.

1338
01:35:38,622 --> 01:35:39,819
It's true.

1339
01:35:39,822 --> 01:35:42,154
- I'm Anne-Helene.
- Hello.

1340
01:35:42,155 --> 01:35:44,154
Please sit. Join us.

1341
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,487
Thank you.

1342
01:35:45,488 --> 01:35:47,252
We're watching
the world go by.

1343
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:49,554
Sounds great.

1344
01:35:49,555 --> 01:35:51,621
You have no idea
how terribly grief-stricken

1345
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:54,386
we were by Miss Tran's case.

1346
01:35:54,387 --> 01:35:58,188
Jorgen has lost so much sleep
over all the abuses.

1347
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,287
It's humbling, huh?

1348
01:36:11,354 --> 01:36:14,685
Nature is such
a patient sculptor.

1349
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:16,685
Grinding a tiny bit

1350
01:36:16,686 --> 01:36:20,118
each day, slowly, slowly,
for thousands of years,

1351
01:36:20,119 --> 01:36:25,154
to make such a supremely
beautiful thing.

1352
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,953
What a waste.

1353
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:34,087
What a dreadful waste.

1354
01:36:43,786 --> 01:36:45,585
You'll have to excuse Jorgen.

1355
01:36:45,587 --> 01:36:49,117
These past few days
has been especially hard.

1356
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:52,283
Such a big decision to make,
and so quickly.

1357
01:36:52,284 --> 01:36:55,184
Normally, when we visit the
colony, we like to spend

1358
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:58,884
a few days in Henningsvar,
but then the news came.

1359
01:36:59,685 --> 01:37:00,983
And...

1360
01:37:00,984 --> 01:37:04,783
Yeah, well, here we are,
suddenly imposing on you.

1361
01:37:04,784 --> 01:37:06,917
We scarcely
had the time to pack.

1362
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:10,550
I'm sorry, wait, what news?

1363
01:37:10,551 --> 01:37:13,149
Why, the methane release
in Antarctica.

1364
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:15,317
You must know
about the methane.

1365
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:17,615
Yeah.

1366
01:37:17,618 --> 01:37:19,416
That's not new, is it?
I mean...

1367
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:22,317
New or old,

1368
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:24,717
it's the end.

1369
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:28,384
It's the end of everything.

1370
01:37:30,382 --> 01:37:34,814
The world has already seen
five major extinctions,

1371
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:37,015
and now there will be another.

1372
01:37:37,016 --> 01:37:40,814
I didn't want to believe it,
none of us did,

1373
01:37:40,815 --> 01:37:44,980
but there we were in Helsinki,
big and small:

1374
01:37:44,983 --> 01:37:47,912
Climatologists,
bacteriologists,

1375
01:37:47,914 --> 01:37:51,715
demographers, physicists,
immunologists.

1376
01:37:51,716 --> 01:37:55,779
Twenty-six Nobel Prize winners
among us.

1377
01:37:55,782 --> 01:37:58,515
We built all the models,
did all the math

1378
01:37:58,516 --> 01:38:02,113
and our conclusion
was consistent.

1379
01:38:02,114 --> 01:38:06,645
Homo sapiens will soon vanish
from the Earth.

1380
01:38:06,648 --> 01:38:09,780
It is now an actuarial
certainty.

1381
01:38:10,646 --> 01:38:13,380
No matter
how the end will come,

1382
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:15,680
environmental disaster,

1383
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:18,712
pandemic disease,
unbreathable air,

1384
01:38:18,713 --> 01:38:20,180
impotable water,

1385
01:38:20,181 --> 01:38:22,845
not enough food,
nuclear winter,

1386
01:38:22,846 --> 01:38:25,913
some combination of them all,

1387
01:38:26,747 --> 01:38:28,880
relatively soon the Earth will

1388
01:38:28,881 --> 01:38:31,947
indeed purge itself
of human life

1389
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,980
and God knows
how many other species.

1390
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:38,813
Do you really mean extinction?

1391
01:38:38,814 --> 01:38:40,511
What about downsizing?

1392
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,644
Yeah, yeah,
too little too late.

1393
01:38:42,645 --> 01:38:45,676
Only 3% of the world
has miniaturized.

1394
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,846
There simply
isn't enough time.

1395
01:38:51,613 --> 01:38:55,644
Not a very successful species,
these Homo sapiens,

1396
01:38:55,645 --> 01:38:58,711
even with such
great intelligence.

1397
01:38:58,712 --> 01:39:01,778
Barely 200,000 years.

1398
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:04,411
Alligator has survived
200 million years

1399
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:06,978
with a brain
the size of a walnut.

1400
01:39:11,512 --> 01:39:12,743
People have
been predicting

1401
01:39:12,744 --> 01:39:15,444
the end of the world
for thousands of years.

1402
01:39:16,445 --> 01:39:18,445
Now it's really happening.

1403
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:23,310
I guess somebody
had to be right someday.

1404
01:39:24,677 --> 01:39:26,212
So sad.

1405
01:39:27,578 --> 01:39:29,043
Very sad.

1406
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:46,444
Okay, I go sleep now.
Good night, Paul.

1407
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:49,243
Good night, Ngoc Lan.

1408
01:39:53,643 --> 01:39:56,109
- You okay?
- I fine.

1409
01:39:56,110 --> 01:39:58,875
You know, maybe I should
take a look at your leg.

1410
01:39:58,877 --> 01:40:01,074
Okay. Yes, you look.

1411
01:40:05,676 --> 01:40:07,007
Ah, yep.

1412
01:40:07,342 --> 01:40:09,073
Wow.

1413
01:40:09,076 --> 01:40:12,076
That peg is really
making the skin chafe.

1414
01:40:12,609 --> 01:40:14,240
Okay.

1415
01:40:21,608 --> 01:40:22,641
You know,

1416
01:40:23,641 --> 01:40:26,041
if somebody had told me
10 years ago

1417
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:29,439
that one day I'd be
five inches tall and divorced

1418
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,671
helping a famous Vietnamese
dissident get a new foot

1419
01:40:32,673 --> 01:40:35,104
while cruising up a fjord
in Norway

1420
01:40:35,106 --> 01:40:36,573
discussing the end
of the world

1421
01:40:36,574 --> 01:40:38,108
with Jorgen Asbjornsen,

1422
01:40:39,141 --> 01:40:41,274
I'd have said he was crazy.

1423
01:41:16,605 --> 01:41:18,136
I'm sorry.

1424
01:41:18,139 --> 01:41:20,569
I'm sorry, I thought...

1425
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,171
Jesus, I'm such an idiot.

1426
01:41:22,605 --> 01:41:23,605
No.

1427
01:41:25,471 --> 01:41:28,005
Please. I want.

1428
01:42:05,070 --> 01:42:06,537
Good morning.

1429
01:42:08,802 --> 01:42:10,270
Good morning.

1430
01:42:13,802 --> 01:42:15,301
What's that sound?

1431
01:42:15,802 --> 01:42:17,269
A greeting.

1432
01:43:50,631 --> 01:43:54,529
Wow! That's it.
That's the original colony!

1433
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:57,395
What, and there's no net?
No walls?

1434
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:58,697
No, we've been lucky.

1435
01:43:58,698 --> 01:44:02,261
We are too close to the sea
for the mosquitoes.

1436
01:44:02,264 --> 01:44:04,962
And over the years
we realized that the birds,

1437
01:44:04,963 --> 01:44:07,130
they prefer the lemmings.

1438
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:09,863
But, yes, this is
where we started

1439
01:44:09,864 --> 01:44:11,396
many years ago.

1440
01:44:46,462 --> 01:44:49,060
George,
good to see you.

1441
01:44:49,061 --> 01:44:50,993
Good to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

1442
01:44:50,994 --> 01:44:52,261
No, no...

1443
01:44:52,262 --> 01:44:53,462
Jorgen!

1444
01:44:54,128 --> 01:44:55,725
Anne-Helene!

1445
01:44:55,728 --> 01:45:00,462
Oh, thank God you're here!
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1446
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:01,960
Oh!

1447
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,627
I love you so much!

1448
01:45:05,427 --> 01:45:07,828
I love you both so much.

1449
01:45:08,728 --> 01:45:10,091
Ever since the decision,

1450
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:12,127
I didn't feel right
without you here.

1451
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:14,060
And you know how I am
when I worry.

1452
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:16,027
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

1453
01:45:16,029 --> 01:45:18,292
Ask anyone here,
they tell you.

1454
01:45:18,293 --> 01:45:20,559
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

1455
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,960
but we need your advice.
Immediately.

1456
01:45:22,962 --> 01:45:24,692
Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

1457
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:25,591
Of course, darling.

1458
01:45:25,592 --> 01:45:27,926
You've got important
things to do.

1459
01:45:29,226 --> 01:45:32,189
Oh! Dusan, Dusan, Dusan!

1460
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:35,458
Bless you for
coming so quickly.

1461
01:45:37,793 --> 01:45:39,326
Solveig, my darling.

1462
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,189
I'm always happy
to help in difficult times,

1463
01:45:42,192 --> 01:45:43,457
in easy times, in happy times.

1464
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,692
It's always a pleasure
to come and visit you

1465
01:45:45,694 --> 01:45:47,457
and your lovely village.

1466
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:49,923
- It is lovely, isn't it?
- Oh.

1467
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:53,990
I can't bear to think
I won't see it again.

1468
01:45:53,993 --> 01:45:55,657
You know, I'm the one
who made

1469
01:45:55,658 --> 01:45:58,490
this colony possible
in the first place.

1470
01:45:58,493 --> 01:46:01,823
I've been coming
since I was just a baby.

1471
01:46:01,824 --> 01:46:03,958
I remember one time...

1472
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:07,591
Wait. I know you.

1473
01:46:07,592 --> 01:46:10,390
You were in
my dream last night!

1474
01:46:10,391 --> 01:46:13,122
You were a horse, or a pony.

1475
01:46:13,125 --> 01:46:15,055
Something very strong!

1476
01:46:15,057 --> 01:46:16,590
And I mounted you

1477
01:46:16,591 --> 01:46:20,988
and rode you through
a dangerous forest.

1478
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:23,855
- Okay.
- And here you are,

1479
01:46:23,858 --> 01:46:26,256
right before we leave.

1480
01:46:26,257 --> 01:46:28,654
Another miracle!

1481
01:46:28,655 --> 01:46:31,788
You are coming with us,
aren't you?

1482
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,989
Where are you going?

1483
01:46:34,922 --> 01:46:36,720
In there.

1484
01:46:36,722 --> 01:46:38,422
Would you like to see?

1485
01:46:50,355 --> 01:46:51,689
Where this go?

1486
01:46:52,256 --> 01:46:54,256
To the vault!

1487
01:46:54,989 --> 01:46:56,854
- The vault?
- Oh, yes.

1488
01:46:56,855 --> 01:46:58,020
We've been working on it

1489
01:46:58,021 --> 01:47:00,520
almost since
the very beginning.

1490
01:47:00,521 --> 01:47:03,188
When Jorgen made
his big discovery,

1491
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:06,252
I said, look, Jorgen,
you're a genius

1492
01:47:06,255 --> 01:47:08,488
and downsizing
is a genius idea,

1493
01:47:08,489 --> 01:47:10,587
no one is questioning that,

1494
01:47:10,588 --> 01:47:14,353
but what if people
don't accept it?

1495
01:47:14,354 --> 01:47:17,587
What if it doesn't
come out on time?

1496
01:47:17,588 --> 01:47:20,153
Anyway, this is what
they came up with.

1497
01:47:20,154 --> 01:47:22,787
On my suggestion.

1498
01:47:22,788 --> 01:47:24,353
Torvald, be a sweetheart

1499
01:47:24,354 --> 01:47:26,787
and give our friends
a little tour.

1500
01:47:27,587 --> 01:47:29,220
Oh, sure.

1501
01:47:29,221 --> 01:47:32,353
The tunnel leads
to a vault 1.6 kilometers

1502
01:47:32,354 --> 01:47:33,984
inside the Earth's lithosphere

1503
01:47:33,985 --> 01:47:37,917
and is encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625.

1504
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,252
In addition to maintaining

1505
01:47:39,253 --> 01:47:41,585
a broad spectrum
of biodiversity,

1506
01:47:41,587 --> 01:47:45,185
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods,

1507
01:47:45,186 --> 01:47:46,719
forests for lumber,

1508
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,350
livestock for animal
husbandry...

1509
01:47:49,351 --> 01:47:52,152
The residential areas
are spacious

1510
01:47:52,154 --> 01:47:53,752
and easily expandable

1511
01:47:53,753 --> 01:47:56,420
to provide for
future generations.

1512
01:47:57,418 --> 01:48:00,149
Wait, but...
That's not all underground.

1513
01:48:00,152 --> 01:48:01,417
Oh, yes.

1514
01:48:01,418 --> 01:48:04,484
Our new small size
makes it possible.

1515
01:48:04,485 --> 01:48:06,385
Otherwise we never
could have dreamed

1516
01:48:06,386 --> 01:48:08,585
of preserving
so much of the world

1517
01:48:08,587 --> 01:48:11,118
in a single safe place.

1518
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,649
This is brilliant!

1519
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,649
I mean, isn't this brilliant?
It's like Noah's Ark!

1520
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:18,350
Yes, exactly.

1521
01:48:18,351 --> 01:48:19,948
It's Noah's Ark.

1522
01:48:19,951 --> 01:48:23,149
So, what do you do for power?
Is it nuclear?

1523
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:25,417
No, no,
100% geothermal.

1524
01:48:25,418 --> 01:48:27,582
And we have interoperable
organic systems

1525
01:48:27,583 --> 01:48:30,216
to manage production
of artificial sunlight,

1526
01:48:30,217 --> 01:48:34,750
oxygen, CO2 elimination,
water purification, and so on.

1527
01:48:37,283 --> 01:48:39,881
And how long will you
stay down there?

1528
01:48:39,884 --> 01:48:41,881
Torvald, how long is it?

1529
01:48:41,884 --> 01:48:43,515
8,000 years?

1530
01:48:43,516 --> 01:48:45,015
Well,
something like that.

1531
01:48:45,016 --> 01:48:48,051
Just until the surface
environment stabilizes.

1532
01:48:51,315 --> 01:48:52,546
<i>It's not unprecedented</i>

1533
01:48:52,548 --> 01:48:54,483
<i>what we are doing here.</i>

1534
01:48:54,484 --> 01:48:56,716
Less than 100,000 years ago,

1535
01:48:56,717 --> 01:48:59,948
humans underwent
a near extinction.

1536
01:48:59,949 --> 01:49:02,015
Maybe 2,000 survived.

1537
01:49:02,016 --> 01:49:03,115
And from that handful

1538
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:05,747
came all of the billions
of people you see today.

1539
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:08,081
Rebooting the species.
It's nothing new.

1540
01:49:08,082 --> 01:49:09,115
Yeah, exactly.

1541
01:49:17,815 --> 01:49:19,814
My friends.

1542
01:49:19,815 --> 01:49:21,046
Many years ago,

1543
01:49:21,047 --> 01:49:24,447
when we discovered
cellular miniaturization,

1544
01:49:24,448 --> 01:49:27,345
the world which had
seemed so doomed

1545
01:49:27,347 --> 01:49:30,414
felt suddenly
so full of possibilities.

1546
01:49:31,081 --> 01:49:33,581
So, until very recently,

1547
01:49:33,582 --> 01:49:35,447
I maintained hope

1548
01:49:35,448 --> 01:49:38,313
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow

1549
01:49:38,314 --> 01:49:40,646
could remain simply that.

1550
01:49:41,081 --> 01:49:42,614
A plan.

1551
01:49:44,014 --> 01:49:45,079
But

1552
01:49:45,947 --> 01:49:48,078
history has spoken.

1553
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:52,545
And this is our final dinner
in the place we called home

1554
01:49:52,546 --> 01:49:54,546
for so many years.

1555
01:49:55,146 --> 01:49:59,444
Yes, we are sad to leave.

1556
01:49:59,445 --> 01:50:03,512
And terribly sad
for the reasons why.

1557
01:50:04,846 --> 01:50:06,479
But man

1558
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,613
is too beautiful,

1559
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,144
too improbable
a lifeform

1560
01:50:12,145 --> 01:50:16,145
to be allowed to disappear
forever from the cosmos.

1561
01:50:18,811 --> 01:50:19,944
Now then,

1562
01:50:21,546 --> 01:50:24,211
I would like to ask
the surviving members

1563
01:50:24,212 --> 01:50:26,679
of the original colony
to stand.

1564
01:50:39,311 --> 01:50:41,443
Ah, look at him.

1565
01:50:41,444 --> 01:50:43,243
Little Ronni.

1566
01:50:43,244 --> 01:50:44,978
How he has grown.

1567
01:50:50,078 --> 01:50:55,011
I ask you again, as I asked
you so many years ago.

1568
01:50:56,078 --> 01:50:57,943
Generations to come,

1569
01:50:57,944 --> 01:51:00,408
perhaps all of humanity
will thank you

1570
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:03,274
for your bravery
and commitment.

1571
01:51:03,275 --> 01:51:04,707
But you must ask yourself

1572
01:51:04,710 --> 01:51:07,841
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world,

1573
01:51:07,842 --> 01:51:10,841
for there will be
no turning back.

1574
01:51:12,643 --> 01:51:14,643
Are you ready?

1575
01:51:20,641 --> 01:51:23,041
Is everyone ready?

1576
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:32,743
We are ready!
We are ready! We are ready!

1577
01:52:11,574 --> 01:52:12,739
Paul!

1578
01:52:14,841 --> 01:52:16,203
Yeah.

1579
01:52:16,206 --> 01:52:17,939
Can you come down here?

1580
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,907
Where you go?
I look many place for you.

1581
01:52:27,105 --> 01:52:28,770
I was just here.

1582
01:52:28,773 --> 01:52:30,171
I talk with Mr. Dusan.

1583
01:52:30,172 --> 01:52:33,537
He say fat lady pay,
he ready go back.

1584
01:52:33,538 --> 01:52:34,871
I happy for that.

1585
01:52:34,872 --> 01:52:37,771
Too long time away from
<i>Señor</i> Cardenas and Mrs. Lopez.

1586
01:52:38,439 --> 01:52:40,703
Oh, I worry too much for them.

1587
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,569
Ngoc Lan, you can't just be

1588
01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:44,305
worried for
a few little people

1589
01:52:44,306 --> 01:52:46,372
thousands of miles away.

1590
01:52:46,373 --> 01:52:48,306
You have to look
at the big picture.

1591
01:52:49,372 --> 01:52:51,104
Why you say like this?

1592
01:52:51,105 --> 01:52:54,971
Well, because Mr. Cardenas
and Mrs. Lopez,

1593
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:57,703
they don't stand a chance.

1594
01:52:57,704 --> 01:52:59,435
None of us do.

1595
01:52:59,438 --> 01:53:01,038
It's over.

1596
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,069
You want go with them.

1597
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,238
And I want you
to come with me.

1598
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:10,234
You crazy man!

1599
01:53:10,237 --> 01:53:13,435
Always I know you stupid,
now I see you crazy, too!

1600
01:53:13,436 --> 01:53:15,935
How am I crazy?
You heard them.

1601
01:53:15,938 --> 01:53:18,435
This is the only chance for
the survival of our species.

1602
01:53:18,436 --> 01:53:19,702
That's huge!

1603
01:53:19,703 --> 01:53:21,167
You want to help people?

1604
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:24,203
These are the people
that you should be helping.

1605
01:53:24,204 --> 01:53:27,868
The future of humanity
is down that hole!

1606
01:53:27,869 --> 01:53:29,935
Who you help down there?

1607
01:53:29,936 --> 01:53:33,268
People here need help,
not down stupid hole.

1608
01:53:34,735 --> 01:53:36,576
Mr. Dusan! Mr. Konrad!

1609
01:53:36,837 --> 01:53:38,100
Talk to crazy Paul.

1610
01:53:38,103 --> 01:53:40,701
He want go down hole,
me go with him!

1611
01:53:40,703 --> 01:53:42,002
Paul, Paul, Paul.

1612
01:53:42,003 --> 01:53:44,868
Why you want to do
such a silly thing?

1613
01:53:44,869 --> 01:53:46,734
Dusan, these people
are actually trying

1614
01:53:46,735 --> 01:53:48,734
to do something
to save the human race.

1615
01:53:48,735 --> 01:53:50,501
I want to be a part of that.

1616
01:53:50,502 --> 01:53:51,935
Okay, fine. You want to help,

1617
01:53:51,936 --> 01:53:54,399
then do what I did,
give them a semen sample.

1618
01:53:54,402 --> 01:53:55,734
I did it, too.

1619
01:53:55,735 --> 01:53:57,899
A much more pleasant
way to help.

1620
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:59,867
If I'm not supposed to be
a part of this thing,

1621
01:53:59,868 --> 01:54:01,902
then what am I doing here?

1622
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:04,867
Why didn't I become a doctor?

1623
01:54:04,868 --> 01:54:07,765
Why did I downsize?
Why did my wife abandon me?

1624
01:54:07,768 --> 01:54:10,234
Dusan, how did you just happen
to be my neighbor?

1625
01:54:10,235 --> 01:54:12,432
And, Ngoc Lan,
why are you the only person

1626
01:54:12,435 --> 01:54:13,631
who survived that box,

1627
01:54:13,634 --> 01:54:14,734
and you just happen to be

1628
01:54:14,735 --> 01:54:16,832
cleaning Dusan's place
on that day?

1629
01:54:16,835 --> 01:54:18,067
And had you not lost your leg,

1630
01:54:18,069 --> 01:54:19,399
I wouldn't have
tried to help you,

1631
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,698
which, as usual,
I screwed up.

1632
01:54:21,699 --> 01:54:23,367
And why did I screw it up?

1633
01:54:23,368 --> 01:54:27,265
So that I could be here,
right at the exact moment

1634
01:54:27,266 --> 01:54:28,800
to go down into that tunnel.

1635
01:54:29,868 --> 01:54:33,796
I finally have a chance
to do something that matters!

1636
01:54:33,798 --> 01:54:35,863
Paul, come on,
now you talking crazy.

1637
01:54:35,865 --> 01:54:38,265
These people,
they're wonderful, but...

1638
01:54:38,266 --> 01:54:40,399
- It's like a cult.
- It's a cult!

1639
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,698
And the extinction,
it's not gonna happen

1640
01:54:42,699 --> 01:54:44,529
for, you know,
maybe a few hundred years.

1641
01:54:44,532 --> 01:54:46,730
Has nothing to do with you.
Forget it.

1642
01:54:46,733 --> 01:54:48,399
Besides, you think
they won't behave

1643
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:49,730
like people always behave?

1644
01:54:49,733 --> 01:54:50,962
They're all going to go insane

1645
01:54:50,965 --> 01:54:52,029
down there
and kill each other.

1646
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:54,931
They go extinct
long before we do.

1647
01:55:05,498 --> 01:55:06,595
Don't worry, darling.

1648
01:55:06,597 --> 01:55:07,831
He said it himself.

1649
01:55:07,832 --> 01:55:10,264
Nothing he ever wants
to do works out.

1650
01:55:47,463 --> 01:55:50,127
It's a beautiful day, huh?

1651
01:55:50,128 --> 01:55:51,862
I mean, knowing
this is the last time

1652
01:55:51,863 --> 01:55:54,394
I'll see the real sun,
it makes it so

1653
01:55:54,395 --> 01:55:55,862
vibrant.

1654
01:55:59,262 --> 01:56:03,662
I ask you question.
You say me true, okay?

1655
01:56:03,663 --> 01:56:04,862
Of course.

1656
01:56:04,863 --> 01:56:06,728
Other night on boat,

1657
01:56:06,729 --> 01:56:08,529
what kind of fuck
you give me?

1658
01:56:09,262 --> 01:56:10,426
What?

1659
01:56:10,427 --> 01:56:12,427
What kind of fuck you give me?

1660
01:56:13,395 --> 01:56:15,158
What kind? I... I don't...

1661
01:56:15,161 --> 01:56:17,828
American people,
eight kind of fuck.

1662
01:56:17,829 --> 01:56:21,094
Love fuck, hate fuck,
sex-only fuck,

1663
01:56:21,095 --> 01:56:23,725
break-up fuck, make-up fuck,
drunk fuck,

1664
01:56:23,728 --> 01:56:25,827
buddy fuck, pity fuck.

1665
01:56:25,828 --> 01:56:28,524
Okay, I have no idea
where you heard that, but...

1666
01:56:28,527 --> 01:56:29,926
Third host family.

1667
01:56:29,927 --> 01:56:32,326
Okay, that is just wrong.

1668
01:56:32,328 --> 01:56:37,725
There's a whole spectrum
of emotions and motivations.

1669
01:56:37,726 --> 01:56:40,059
And don't say "fuck."
It's vulgar.

1670
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:41,893
Say something else.
Like, you know,

1671
01:56:41,895 --> 01:56:43,890
"make love," or something.
I don't know.

1672
01:56:43,893 --> 01:56:46,091
So, was love fuck?

1673
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:51,092
Okay, what is this all about?

1674
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,323
You look for me,
you want help me,

1675
01:56:57,326 --> 01:56:58,890
you make fuck with me.

1676
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:01,158
Now you go down stupid hole.

1677
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:03,992
So I try to think

1678
01:57:03,993 --> 01:57:06,192
what kind of fuck you give me.

1679
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:09,925
I think maybe pity fuck.
For leg.

1680
01:57:09,926 --> 01:57:13,125
No. No. Ngoc Lan,

1681
01:57:13,127 --> 01:57:15,756
I care about you, deeply.

1682
01:57:15,759 --> 01:57:16,957
You are

1683
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:18,256
such an extraordinary person,

1684
01:57:18,257 --> 01:57:21,158
and I just admire you so much.

1685
01:57:21,824 --> 01:57:23,957
More than anything.

1686
01:57:23,958 --> 01:57:25,492
I want you to come with me.

1687
01:57:29,157 --> 01:57:31,556
People always say me I strong.

1688
01:57:33,423 --> 01:57:35,490
Okay, maybe Vietnam

1689
01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:39,154
I organize many protest,

1690
01:57:39,157 --> 01:57:43,154
survive two year prison,
punish me make small.

1691
01:57:43,157 --> 01:57:46,122
I only person survive TV box.

1692
01:57:46,123 --> 01:57:49,923
I walk around, no foot.
Take care for other people.

1693
01:57:50,557 --> 01:57:53,423
But I woman. Feeling.

1694
01:57:55,623 --> 01:57:58,623
I'm sorry. I really am.

1695
01:57:59,823 --> 01:58:03,886
It's so easy for me
to see who you are.

1696
01:58:03,889 --> 01:58:06,288
But if I don't do this,
who am I?

1697
01:58:06,957 --> 01:58:09,090
I mean, really, who am I?

1698
01:58:09,756 --> 01:58:11,622
You Paul Safranek!

1699
01:58:12,289 --> 01:58:13,956
You good man!

1700
01:58:19,588 --> 01:58:21,521
Look, Ngoc Lan, butterflies!

1701
02:00:07,083 --> 02:00:09,016
I guess this is it.

1702
02:00:10,416 --> 02:00:11,547
Konrad.

1703
02:00:12,217 --> 02:00:14,284
Very nice to have met you.

1704
02:00:14,817 --> 02:00:16,747
Pleasure was mine.

1705
02:00:16,748 --> 02:00:18,347
Good luck in there, Paul.

1706
02:00:29,583 --> 02:00:31,384
Take care of yourself.

1707
02:00:32,315 --> 02:00:33,382
I will.

1708
02:00:34,315 --> 02:00:35,315
You, too.

1709
02:00:36,149 --> 02:00:38,682
I will miss my funny neighbor.

1710
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:56,215
Your Bible.

1711
02:00:59,681 --> 02:01:01,748
But it's in Vietnamese.

1712
02:01:03,014 --> 02:01:04,747
Words not matter.

1713
02:01:06,081 --> 02:01:07,747
Remember me.

1714
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,613
You go away now.

1715
02:02:16,078 --> 02:02:17,344
Excuse me.

1716
02:02:17,345 --> 02:02:21,274
Hi. Uh, is it just me,
or are we walking uphill?

1717
02:02:21,277 --> 02:02:23,908
Yes. Prevents flooding.

1718
02:02:23,911 --> 02:02:26,645
- Tunde.
- Oh, hi. Paul.

1719
02:02:27,810 --> 02:02:29,242
It's just a few hours climb

1720
02:02:29,243 --> 02:02:31,341
before we begin
the descent to the vault.

1721
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:33,408
Well, how long
is the whole walk?

1722
02:02:33,409 --> 02:02:35,573
Eleven hours,
something like that.

1723
02:02:35,576 --> 02:02:38,176
See you down there.
Stay hydrated.

1724
02:03:34,207 --> 02:03:35,806
Wait!

1725
02:03:37,472 --> 02:03:38,538
No, wait.

1726
02:03:39,274 --> 02:03:41,738
Thank you so much.

1727
02:03:41,739 --> 02:03:44,537
- Wait, my bag. No, no, no.
- Leave it!

1728
02:03:44,539 --> 02:03:47,537
I told you nothing ever
works out for this guy.

1729
02:03:47,539 --> 02:03:49,872
It's going
to blow. Run!

1730
02:03:52,806 --> 02:03:53,806
Paul!

1731
02:03:55,006 --> 02:03:56,405
Ngoc Lan!

1732
02:04:04,538 --> 02:04:06,403
I was thinking
about what you were saying.

1733
02:04:06,404 --> 02:04:08,471
And I realized you were right.

1734
02:04:09,005 --> 02:04:10,738
I am Paul Safranek.

1735
02:04:11,471 --> 02:04:13,604
And what you were asking?

1736
02:04:15,005 --> 02:04:16,938
It was a love fuck.

1737
02:05:37,368 --> 02:05:38,966
And to think

1738
02:05:40,234 --> 02:05:42,701
one day, all of this...

1739
02:05:46,766 --> 02:05:48,832
Now maybe you
understand little bit

1740
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:51,833
how I feel
after survive TV box.

1741
02:05:57,701 --> 02:06:00,368
When you know
death come soon,

1742
02:06:01,399 --> 02:06:04,065
you look around things
more close.

1743
02:07:10,496 --> 02:07:12,694
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

1744
02:07:12,697 --> 02:07:15,627
I want go, too.
I want see Rosa new baby.

1745
02:07:15,630 --> 02:07:18,630
No, see the baby tomorrow.
It's pouring!

1746
02:07:21,929 --> 02:07:23,261
Hurry.

1747
02:07:23,262 --> 02:07:24,961
Don't forget,
we still need go see

1748
02:07:24,962 --> 02:07:27,426
Philippine man,
