克服了罪恶的命运
{\fs12}overcome with guilt by the fortune

17
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,540
用她已故的丈夫家族的积累财富
{\fs12}her late husband's family had amassed

18
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,399
即靠一战期间生产芥子气
{\fs12}producing mustard gas during World War I,

19
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,556
创办了我们的研究所
{\fs12}founded our institute

20
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:18,103
使得科学奇迹

21
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:20,369
反而可以用来帮助人类
{\fs12}could instead be used to help mankind.

22
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:22,324
在20世纪50年代

25
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:33,462

00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:39,174
以及对粮食和水源安全的破坏性影响
{\fs12}and the devastating impact on food and water security.

28
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,306
在许多年前 我们设想了众多解决方案
{\fs12}Among the many solutions we conceived so many years ago,

29
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:44,567
其中一个
{\fs12}one...

30
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,466
貌似雄心勃勃
{\fs12}which seemed then so ambitious, so

31
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:48,763
脱离我们的掌握
{\fs12}out of our grasp

32

46
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,838
五年前
{\fs12}Five years ago,

47
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:04,557
在研究所的前人研究的基础上
{\fs12}building on the research of our predecessors at the institute,

48
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,547
我和我的团队发现了一个过程
{\fs12}my team and I discovered a process

49
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,530
可以减少整体有机物质
{\fs12}by which all organic material can be reduced

50
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:14,461
基于细胞级的维度
{\fs12}at the cellular level by a ratio of approximately

51
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,985
比例约为2744:1
{\fs12}2,744 to one.

52
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,199
这一过程能将身高1.8米的人
{\fs12}Such a process converts a man of 1.8 meters

53
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,511
缩短到12.9厘米
{\fs12}to just 12.9 centimeters.

54
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,183
诸多的动植物群

00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:30,332
已经接受本过程的实践
{\fs12}were subjected in this process

56
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:34,573
除了一些鱼类和贝类
{\fs12}and with the exception of some fish and shellfish,

57
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,129
绝无任何副作用
{\fs12}absolutely no side effects were detected.

58
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,270
谢谢 关灯

{\fs12}as the very first humans to undergo cellular reduction.

63
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,588
这个过程短暂 无痛
{\fs12}The process is short and painless,

64
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,718
只有轻微的不适
{\fs12}with only the mild discomfort of removal

65
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:05,031
需要换牙 及其他修补术
{\fs12}and replacement of dental and other prosthetics.

66
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:08,348
受试者需置于浅镇静的处所
{\fs12}The subjects are placed under light sedation,

67
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,857
在短暂的休息之后
{\fs12}and after a brief rest,

68
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,884
一两个小时内 即可完全恢复
{\fs12}fully recover within an hour or two.

69
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,365
之后 我们的小城镇
{\fs12}Once completed, our little village,

70
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,639
大约7*11米见方
{\fs12}just seven meters by eleven meters,

71
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:28,490

73
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,061
并避免动物和昆虫
{\fs12}animals and insects.

74
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,080
我们开始一起生活

是所有的不可降解的废物
{\fs12}all of the uncompostable waste

79
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,973
是36个人 超过四年的结果
{\fs12}produced by 36 people over four years.

80
00:07:00,947 --> 00:07:02,517
在今天下午的会议上
{\fs12}In this afternoon's session,

{\fs12}we will outline our proposal for a two to three-hundred year transition

82
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,244
让世界从大变小
{\fs12}for the world to transform from big into small.

83
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:11,962

你饿了吗
{\fs12}You hungry?

98
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,013
我一小时前吃了
{\fs12}I ate about an hour ago.

99
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,958
我不知道你什么时候回来
{\fs12}I didn't know when you were coming.

100
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,640
你知道 我带吃的回来的
{\fs12}You knew I was bringing food.

101
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,376
我打电话给你 特别问过你
{\fs12}I called you and asked you specifically.

102
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,320
我刚吃了芝麻鸡 - 那你吃啊
{\fs12}I just had sesame chicken. -And then you go and eat.

103
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,697
我还是很饿
{\fs12}I'm still hungry.

104
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,771
有预谋的尖叫

105
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:47,505
然而 较少的人知道他的新书

我不明白
{\fs12}I don't get it.

113
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,533
为什么会有人想自虐
{\fs12}Why would anybody want to do that to himself?

114
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,225
他们可以把人缩小

115
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,358
飞到火星

116
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,637
却治不好我的纤维肌痛
{\fs12}and they can't cure my fibromyalgia?

117
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,888
尽是对于环境的大惊小怪
{\fs12}And all this fuss about the environment

118
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:24,270
哪怕世界 明天就要完蛋了

119
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:26,517
我很痛苦
{\fs12}I'm in pain.

120

我不能呼吸
{\fs12}I can't breathe.

121
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,408
反而不重要吗
{\fs12}Doesn't that matter?

122
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,849
很多人都很痛苦 妈妈
{\fs12}Lots of people are in pain, Mom.

128
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,760
正常还是
{\fs12}Is it usually or more like...

129
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,041
刺痛
{\fs12}tingling?

130
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:16,223
更像是刺痛 刺痛 好
{\fs12}More like tingling. -Tingling. Okay.

131
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,609
缩小术只是失控列车的技术
{\fs12}This downsizing thing is simply runaway train technology

132
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,671
具有破坏性的影响
{\fs12}that's having a devastating impact

133
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,359
对于我们的世界经济
{\fs12}on our world economy.

00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,790
我们已经损失了数十亿美元的消费支出

135

汽车、住房和国防

在社会的任何重大变革中
{\fs12}In any major transformation of society,

142
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,551
有严重的阵痛期吗
{\fs12}are there serious growing pains?

143
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,479
当然
{\fs12}Sure.

144
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,502
但以目前的质量和体积

地球人类生命不可持续

{\fs12}This family on my block just moved away to get small,

148
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,881

{\fs12}now their house is just sittin' there.

149
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,670
他们正在做的 是让每个人的价值观跳水
{\fs12}Makin' everybody's values take a dive is what they're doin'.

150
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:01,078

{\fs12}Just when I'm tryin' to refinance.

我头疼得厉害

我妻子说 即使不用药品 我也能让人入睡 所以
{\fs12}My wife says I put people to sleep even without the drugs, so.

183
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:19,140
很惊讶你还醒着
{\fs12}Surprised you're still awake.

184
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:21,226
他每周都要说两次这个笑话
{\fs12}He uses that joke like twice a week.

185
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,124

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,147
像是职业咨询吗

189
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,203
不 像理疗
{\fs12}Uh, no, it's just like physical therapy

190
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:32,047
但主要关注 工伤和康复
{\fs12}but focused on workplace injuries and rehab,

191
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,883
重复型创伤 下背部 诸如此类的
{\fs12}repetitive stress, lower back, that sort of thing.

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,727
很多肩膀问题
{\fs12}A lot of shoulder problems.

193
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:39,083
我在奥马哈牛排厂干内务
{\fs12}I-I'm in-house over at Omaha Steaks.

194
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,513
他做了很多文书工作 - 嗯
{\fs12}He does a lot of paperwork. -Yeah, well...

195
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
我有腕管综合症 不时的
{\fs12}I get a little carpal tunnel of my own from time to time.

196
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,622
那么

197
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,210
今日的医学早可覆盖你的病症
{\fs12}Medicine these days is all about covering your ass.

198
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,059
但你之前 不是在林肯市的医学预科吗
{\fs12}But weren't you pre-med down in Lincoln?

199
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,552

{\fs12}Good memory, yeah. I put in two years

200
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,083
我妈妈病得很重
{\fs12}uh, then my mom got real sick

201
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,309
所以我搬回奥马哈去照顾她
{\fs12}so I moved back to Omaha to take care of her.

202
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,467
事实上我想当外科医生
{\fs12}I wanted to be a surgeon, actually.

203
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,865
也许我们会一起工作
{\fs12}You know, we might've ended up working together.

204
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,448
你也许是我的麻醉师
{\fs12}I...you could've been my anesthesiologist.

205
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:05,972
怎么样 挺好
{\fs12}How 'bout that? -Yeah.

206
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,797
幸福之门

207
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:20,711
进入黑暗 寻找光明

208
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,079
天那 不会吧

是戴夫・约翰逊
{\fs12}It's Dave, Dave Johnson.

211

还有卡罗尔
{\fs12}And Carol!

212
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:44,722
我能帮忙吗
{\fs12}Can I have a hand?

213
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:46,254
我听说他要来了
{\fs12}I-I heard he was coming.

214
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,332
这样我倒不知道
{\fs12}I had no idea.

215
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:50,105
我从来没想过他会去变小
{\fs12}He never struck me as the kind of guy who'd go get small.

216
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,058
大家 嗨
{\fs12}Hey, everybody! -Hi!

223
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,902
杜松子酒 加奎宁水
{\fs12}A gin and tonic.

224
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,247
加酸橙
{\fs12}With lime.

225
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,559
加酸橙
{\fs12}With lime.

226
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,788
其实我们一开始没有此打算
{\fs12}Well, actually, we weren't planning on coming at all at first.

227
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,162
然后 我们收到各种电邮
{\fs12}But then, you know, we started getting all the e-mails.

228
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:32,718
再加上 我妹妹切除了肿块
{\fs12}Plus my sister was having a lump removed.

229
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,819
我是说 她很好 感谢上帝
{\fs12}I mean, she's-she's fine, thank God.

230
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,640
但我还是要见她
{\fs12}But I still needed to see her.

231
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:38,054
旅行怎么样
{\fs12}So, what's traveling like?

232
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,078
你们是怎么从新墨西哥来的
{\fs12}How'd you guys get up here from New Mexico?

233
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,721
天啊 太棒了
{\fs12}Oh, gosh, it's great.

234
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,635
航空公司越来越对小人友好了
{\fs12}Yeah, the airlines are getting more and more small-friendly.

235
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,581
所有的座位都是头等舱
{\fs12}All the seats are first-class...

236
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,046
在佛罗里达待了几年之后 我们搬到了维加斯
{\fs12}So after a couple of years in Florida, we moved out to Vegas.

237
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:49,867
然后
{\fs12}And that...

238
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:51,773
我记得那是我们最后一次谈话
{\fs12}Yeah, I think that's the last time we talked.

239
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,703
维加斯并非
{\fs12}Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't

240
00:16:53,728 --> 00:16:55,648
我的最佳选择 因为事实证明
{\fs12}such a good choice for me, as it turns out.

241
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,242
养成了真正的坏习惯
{\fs12}Got into some real bad habits.

242
00:16:57,281 --> 00:16:58,641
几乎是人生最低点
{\fs12}Pretty much hit rock bottom.

243
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,176
告诉你 其他女人会逃脱责任
{\fs12}Tell ya, any other woman would've run for the hills.

244
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:03,700
但卡罗尔 伙计 她是个圣人
{\fs12}Carol, man, she's a saint.

245
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,990
她无法摆脱我
{\fs12}She stuck with me.

246
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,046
但我真的要清理一切
{\fs12}But I really had to come clean about everything.

247
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,398
我是说一切
{\fs12}I-I mean everything.

248
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,148
绝大部分
{\fs12}You know...almost.

249
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,460
所以 决定...
{\fs12}So, the decision to...

250
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,967
问题来了
{\fs12}Well, that's the thing.

251
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,546
我们都需要改变
{\fs12}We both needed the change.

252
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,906
点击复位按钮 从头开始
{\fs12}Hit the reset button. Start all over.

253
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,657
而且 这种感觉真的很好
{\fs12}Well, and plus, it must feel good to know

254
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,948
因为你与众不同了
{\fs12}you're really making a difference.

255
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,127
你是指 那些拯救地球的废话吗
{\fs12}You mean all that crap about saving the planet?

256
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:24,181
是的
{\fs12}Yeah.

257
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,787
缩小是为了拯救自己
{\fs12}Downsizing is about saving yourself.

258
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,771
卸除所有的压力
{\fs12}I-It takes the pressure right off.

259
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:29,998
尤其是钱的压力
{\fs12}Especially money pressure.

260
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:33,795
我只是不像其他人那样有野心
{\fs12}I'm just not driven and ambitious like the rest of my family.

261

{\fs12}I'm still living in the same house I grew up in.

263
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,581

{\fs12}I mean, Audrey's dying for us to move

264
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,199
但我们真的资金很紧张
{\fs12}but we're really strapped.

265
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,487
我是说 妈的 我刚还清了助学贷款
{\fs12}I mean, shit, I just finished paying off my student loans.

266
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:48,538
嗯
{\fs12}Yeah, well...

267
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,609
如果你仔细考虑
{\fs12}Listen, if you ever start thinkin' about it seriously,

268
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:53,789
我的意见是
{\fs12}here's my two cents, uh...

269
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:56,612
外面冒出很多小型社区
{\fs12}There's a lot of small communities cropping up out there, but

270
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,620
你别瞎转悠
{\fs12}don't mess around.

277
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,210
我说这话 可不是为了赚取推荐信用
{\fs12}And hey, I'm not just saying all this for the referral credit.

278
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:13,038
只是告诉你一下
{\fs12}Just so you know.

279
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,600
我喜欢小卡罗尔 她做事很机智
{\fs12}I liked little Carol. She's got a lot on the ball.

280
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:20,545

她在吃意大利菜
{\fs12}She's taking Italian.

282
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:23,537
她从未如此健康
{\fs12}And she's never been fitter.

283
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:25,241
他们看起来很幸福

{\fs12}Hey, Saf, Audrey, it's Milo.

290
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:45,935
坏消息
{\fs12}Bad news.

291
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,943
你在第一国民银行的按揭申请 被弹回了
{\fs12}Your mortgage application at First National bounced back.

292
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:51,568
承销商不喜欢你的收入负债比
{\fs12}The underwriter didn't like the income to debt ratios--

293
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:52,952
有点过头了
{\fs12}they're a little excessive.

294
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,311
我不知道你是否愿意
{\fs12}I-I don't know if you can come up with

295
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:57,061
下调15%
{\fs12}another ten-fifteen percent down.

296
00:18:57,548 --> 00:18:59,351
如果你愿意 也许我们再少许添油加醋...
{\fs12}If you could, maybe goose it up a little bit...

297
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:02,621
我们去看看 立马决定是否合适
{\fs12}And then we'll be able to tell right away if it's for us or not.

298
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:04,860
所以别浪费时间
{\fs12}Yeah, so let's not waste a lot of time.

299
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:07,703
如果我们早点到圣达菲 还可以去按摩
{\fs12}Maybe if we get to Santa Fe early, we can get a massage.

300
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,165
听起来不错
{\fs12}Sounds good to me.

309
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:23,954
拜托 伙计们 你们比我大得多
{\fs12}Come on, guys, you're a heck of a lot bigger than I am.

310
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,611
声音大点 你们玩的开心吗
{\fs12}Make some noise! Are you havin' a good time?

311
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:28,456
是的
{\fs12}Yeah! -Yeah!

312
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,971
是的
{\fs12}Yeah! -Yeah!

313
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,792
像点样了
{\fs12}That's more like it.

314
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,017
觉得我的房子怎么样
{\fs12}So, what do you think of my place?

315
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:37,869
很漂亮吧
{\fs12}Pretty nifty, huh?

316
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,149
这就是我梦想之屋
{\fs12}It's the house of my dreams.

317
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,649
见鬼 我想说这是任何人的梦想之屋
{\fs12}Heck, I'd say this is the house of anybody's dreams.

318
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:45,339
像我这样的普通人 要工作20年
{\fs12}Why, an average guy like me would have to work twenty,

319
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:48,593
30 也许40年 才能买得起这样的房子
{\fs12}thirty, maybe forty years to afford a place like this,

320
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:49,570
如若的话
{\fs12}if ever.

321
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:52,559
敬请欣赏屋内
{\fs12}And just wait till you see what's inside.

322
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,094
杰夫
{\fs12}Jeff?

323
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,248
你别老是不告 而邀请客人来了
{\fs12}You've gotta stop inviting guests over without telling me.

324
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:10,374
对不起 劳拉 我只是
{\fs12}Oh, sorry, Laura. I was only--

325
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:14,452
我意思是 忙碌一天之后 我终于可以泡澡放松一下了
{\fs12}I mean, I finally just got in the tub to relax after such a busy day.

326
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:15,883
忙碌什么呢 甜心
{\fs12}Busy doing what, sweetheart?

327
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,414
无尽的事
{\fs12}Oh, no end of things.

328
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:19,944
首先 我上了网球课 然后按摩
{\fs12}First I took a tennis lesson and had a massage.

329
00:21:19,993 --> 00:21:20,688
好
{\fs12}Nice.

330
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,993
然后和姑娘们吃完美食午餐后
{\fs12}And then after a gourmet lunch with the girls,

331
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,581
情不自禁
{\fs12}well, we couldn't help ourselves

332
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,557
去市中心的Loget珠宝新店
{\fs12}so we popped into that new Loget's jewelry store downtown.

333
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,754
Loget啊 我得花多少钱啊
{\fs12}Uh-oh, Loget's. What's than gonna cost me?

334
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:35,131
杰夫 你闭嘴 不用你担心
{\fs12}Now, Jeff, you hush. I was really good.

335
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:38,116
不过是又一个钻石手镯而已
{\fs12}Just another diamond bracelet.

336
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:42,890
就一个钻石手镯吗 听起来不像你
{\fs12}Just a diamond bracelet? That doesn't sound like you.

337
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,863
你是对的 我不喜欢破坏全套
{\fs12}You're right, I don't like to break up a set.

338
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:49,544
我找到了匹配的钻石耳环
{\fs12}So, I got matching diamond earrings

339
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,817
还有一条匹配的钻石项链
{\fs12}and a matching diamond necklace.

340
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:55,070
完美匹配 白金底座
{\fs12}All conflict-free, and set in platinum.

341
00:21:55,234 --> 00:21:56,461
多少钱 劳拉
{\fs12}How much, Laura?

342
00:21:56,598 --> 00:21:59,035
但杰夫 那些看起来很适合我 你应该看到的
{\fs12}Oh, but Jeff, they look so good on me, and you should see--

343
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:00,457
多少钱 劳拉
{\fs12}How much, Laura?

344
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:03,098
嗯 杰夫 - 我问多少钱
{\fs12}Well, Jeff... -I said how much?

345
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:05,339
83美元
{\fs12}Eighty-three dollars.

346
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:08,018
83美元 你疯了吗
{\fs12}Eighty-three dollars? Are you crazy?

347
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:11,059
这几乎是我家整整两个月的食品预算
{\fs12}Why, that's practically our food budget for two whole months!

348
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:52,661
整合在一起 如果你清算你现在的家
{\fs12}Putting it all together, if you liquidate your current home,

349
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,551
汽车和其他资产
{\fs12}cars and other assets,

350
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,505
并购买摄政级的房地产
{\fs12}and purchase a Regency-level estate--

351
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:59,700
记住 这是一个1.2万平方英尺的等值房子
{\fs12}remember that's a 12,000 square foot equivalent home

352
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:04,545
位于1.5英亩的等值地段 基础价格为6.3万美元
{\fs12}on a 1.5 acre equivalent lot-- at a base price of $63,000.

353
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:06,498
可以叠加健康和健身套餐
{\fs12}Then the Health and Fitness package--

354
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:08,725
售价4500美元 你们会想要的
{\fs12}that's $4,500, you're gonna wanna get that.

355
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,984
含健身房、游泳池、桑拿、蒸汽房、热水浴缸和网球场
{\fs12}It's gym, pool, sauna, steam, hot tub, and a tennis court.

356
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,726
然后是两个成年人的医疗保健
{\fs12}Then the medical procedures for two adults.

357
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,304
售价1.5万美元
{\fs12}That's $15,000.

358
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:18,733
但保险是否涵盖上述所有呢
{\fs12}But does insurance cover any of that?

359
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,012
不 但在摄政级 有大额的折扣资格
{\fs12}No, but at the Regency level you qualify of a substantial discount.

360
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:25,006
别忘了 还有联邦税收抵免
{\fs12}And don't forget the federal tax credit.

361
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:25,974
对 对 - 对不对
{\fs12}Right, right. -Right?

362
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:28,630
那么 以你目前的债务
{\fs12}So, taking a look at your current debt,

363
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,272
退休金和其他积蓄
{\fs12}you retirement and your other savings,

364
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:35,419
你们的资产约为15.2万美元
{\fs12}you are at $152,000 in equity.

365
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,755
两位 这笔资产非常宽裕
{\fs12}People, that is a very comfortable number.

366
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,411
宽裕吗 听起来不太像
{\fs12}Comfortable? That doesn't sound like nearly enough.

367
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,512
是的 - 不
{\fs12}Yeah. -Well, no.

368
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:43,418
你们得看看这一栏 奥黛丽
{\fs12}See, you have to look at this column, Audrey.

369
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:44,630
等效价值
{\fs12}Equivalent value.

370
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,134
你们稳稳地位于蓝筹股区域内
{\fs12}You're solidly inside the Blue Chip zone.

371
00:23:47,165 --> 00:23:53,431
在悠闲乐园 你们的15.2万美元转化为1250万美元
{\fs12}In Leisureland your $152,000 translates to $12.5 million--

372
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,488
用于生活 用于享受
{\fs12}to live on, for life.

373
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,004
我是说 来吧
{\fs12}I mean, come on!

374
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,535
那么
{\fs12}Oh. -Well.

375
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,966
等等 既然这么好
{\fs12}Hold on, if this is such a good thing,

376
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,569
你怎么还没做呢
{\fs12}how come you haven't done it?

377
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:05,146
我会立马行动的
{\fs12}I would do it in a heartbeat

378
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:06,894
但我丈夫有髋关节置换术
{\fs12}but my husband had a hip replacement

379
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:08,324
所以他没有资格
{\fs12}so he's ineligible.

380
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,607
意下如何啊
{\fs12}So, what do you think?

381
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:12,834
摄政级是你们的首选吗
{\fs12}Would the Regency level be your first choice?

382
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:16,264
还是要再看看豪华点的
{\fs12}Or should should I show you something a little more deluxe?

383
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,853
亲爱的 你为什么不先去挑呢
{\fs12}Honey, why don't you just go ahead and pick.

384
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,275
我想你幸福
{\fs12}I just want you to be happy.

385
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:26,604
真是个好丈夫
{\fs12}That's a good husband.

386
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,251
来看看这个
{\fs12}Take a look at this.

387
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,822
热狗炉多少钱
{\fs12}Hey, how much for the hotdog cooker?

{\fs12}Sold.

391
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:41,720
跟上实习 别偷懒
{\fs12}Keep up with the exercises. Don't get lazy. Look.

392
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:43,577
我都帮你整理好了
{\fs12}I laminated it for you,

393
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:45,688
你没有理由不去做的
{\fs12}so you literally have no excuse not to do it.

394
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,102
好的 谢谢 保罗 多谢
{\fs12}Okay, thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

395
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:47,854
不客气
{\fs12}You bet.

396
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,424
也许有一天我们两口子会变小
{\fs12}Maybe someday me and my wife will get small

397
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,565
然后就来看你们
{\fs12}and we'll come down and see ya.

398
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,702
我很乐意 但现在...好吗
{\fs12}Well, I'd love that. But in the meantime...

399
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,007
好 - 好吧
{\fs12}Okay? -All right.

400
00:24:54,032 --> 00:24:55,976
每晚只有15分钟 好的
{\fs12}Just 15 minutes every night. -Okay.

401
00:24:56,002 --> 00:24:57,390
它会改变你的生活 - 谢谢 保罗
{\fs12}It'll change your life. -Thanks, Paul.

402
00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:58,375
回见 戴夫
{\fs12}See ya, Dave.

403
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,539
我们祝愿保罗・萨法耐克
{\fs12}We're here to wish Paul Safranek

404
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:02,906
告别现在 去悠闲乐园
{\fs12}farewell as he moves on to Leisureland.

405
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,828
我们希望他一切安好
{\fs12}And we wish him nothing but the best.

406
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:06,539
祝你和奥黛丽好运
{\fs12}Good luck to you and Audrey.

407
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,288
谢谢 鲍勃
{\fs12}Thanks, Bob.

408
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,046
谢谢 鲍勃
{\fs12}Thanks, Bob.

409
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,639
你们不考虑宝藏岛
{\fs12}And you guys didn't consider Treasure Island

410
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:19,641
在棕榈沙漠的那个吗
{\fs12}out in Palm Desert?

411
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,303
我们查过了但
{\fs12}Well, we checked it out, but

412
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:23,038
我是说 我立刻喜欢上了
{\fs12}I mean, I liked it all right.

413
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,273
但是奥黛丽认为 他们的便利设施有点吝啬
{\fs12}But Audrey thought they were a little stingy with the amenities.

414
00:25:25,337 --> 00:25:26,368
我是说 特别是考虑需要充值
{\fs12}I mean, especially given what they're charging

415
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:27,806
每月都要充值维护
{\fs12}in monthly maintenance.

416
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,384
然后我就转向保罗说 "好吧 你赢了"
{\fs12}And I just turned to Paul and said, "Okay, you win."

417
00:25:31,587 --> 00:25:32,634
我们决定了
{\fs12}Let's go for it.

418
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:34,759
我们会很想你的
{\fs12}We're just gonna miss you so much.

419
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,952
吉娜 我也会想你的
{\fs12}Oh, Gina, I'm gonna miss you too.

420
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,522
我们又不是要死了 好吗
{\fs12}Well, look, it's not like we're dying, okay?

421
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:41,859
我们只是在搬家
{\fs12}We're just relocating.

422
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:44,690
我们每年至少会回来一次 也许更多
{\fs12}And we'll be back at least once a year. Maybe more.

423
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:53,010
嗨 爸爸 甜心
{\fs12}Hi, Dad. -Sweetheart.

424
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:57,553
很抱歉 你妈没能来
{\fs12}Yeah, well, sorry your mom couldn't bring herself to come.

425
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,273
但她捎来了她的爱
{\fs12}But she sends her love

426
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,054
我们明天下午会在家里等你
{\fs12}and we're expecting you at the house tomorrow afternoon.

427
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:05,484
很高兴你能来 拉里 - 保罗
{\fs12}Glad you could make it, Larry. -Hey, Paul.

428
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:07,171
爸爸 喝点什么
{\fs12}What can I get you, Dad?

429
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:10,877
不如我稍后回来 你们先随便看看呢
{\fs12}Look, why don't I-- here, you guys visit. Um...?

430
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,312
啤酒 好的
{\fs12}Beer. -Yeah.

431
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,195
任何啤酒皆可 - 好的 就来
{\fs12}Just any beer. -That's great, okay, comin' up.

432
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,850
我希望妈妈不要那么辛苦
{\fs12}I wish Mom weren't taking it so hard.

433
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,077
你知道你妈的
{\fs12}Well, you know your mother.

434
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:24,397
坦率地说 我起初对此有点怀疑
{\fs12}Frankly, I was a little skeptical about it myself at first.

435
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:27,273
说 你还记得杰瑞・格罗斯吗
{\fs12}Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

436
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,633
那天我给他打了电话
{\fs12}Well, I called him the other day.

437
00:26:29,658 --> 00:26:31,610
他和贝芙 在那里退休了
{\fs12}He and Bev retired down there.

438
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,360
和你们一样 他们缩小了
{\fs12}Did the whole shrinking thing that you kids are doing.

439
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,439
他说他们相处得很好 从来没有的好
{\fs12}He says they're getting along just fine, never better.

440
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,283
他说他每天都觉得年轻
{\fs12}He says he feels younger every day

441
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,275
一美元买1000美元的东西
{\fs12}and that a dollar buys a thousand dollars worth of stuff.

442
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,569
当然 他们需要支付贝芙服用的所有药费
{\fs12}Of course they need that with all the medication Bev takes.

443
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,718
但是
{\fs12}But, uh... yeah.

444
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:50,497
我 我看到了吸引力
{\fs12}You know, I... I see the appeal.

445
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:53,576
因为犯罪为零 我一直劝你妈
{\fs12}Apparently there's zero crime, I keep telling your mother.

446
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:55,532
很安全的
{\fs12}It's very safe.

447
00:26:57,926 --> 00:26:59,244
对 我们很担心
{\fs12}Yeah, we worry.

448
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:04,442
我年轻时 我失去了...
{\fs12}When I was younger and, and uh, and then I-I lost the...

449
00:27:06,256 --> 00:27:08,428
你们几个要变小了 对吧
{\fs12}You guys are the ones getting small, right?

450
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,444
对 我们夫妻俩
{\fs12}Uh, that's right, my wife and I.

451
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,406
祝好运
{\fs12}Good for you.

452
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:19,472
无意冒犯 但
{\fs12}No offense, but um...

453
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:22,136
既然你们这么小
{\fs12}do you think if you're that small

454
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,159
拥有的权利 和我们其他人一样吗
{\fs12}you should still have all the same rights as the rest of us

455
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,722
正常尺寸的人群
{\fs12}normal-sized people?

456
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,487
我是说 例如投票权
{\fs12}I mean, like the right to vote?

457
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:30,855
为什么不呢
{\fs12}Why wouldn't we?

458
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:33,020
天啊 让我们看看
{\fs12}Oh, well, jeez, let's see, um...

459
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,761
你们购买的产品不大
{\fs12}You don't buy as many products,

460
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:36,270
所以没有付那么多的营业税
{\fs12}you're not paying as much sales tax,

461
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:38,558
你们部分人甚至不缴纳任何所得税
{\fs12}some of you aren't even paying any income tax.

462
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,802
我是说 你们并未真的
{\fs12}I mean, you're not really

463
00:27:39,848 --> 00:27:41,379
参与我们的经济 是吗
{\fs12}participating in our economy, are you?

464
00:27:41,404 --> 00:27:42,954
我是说 事实上你在消费我们
{\fs12}Hey. -I mean, in fact you're costing us

465
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,689
我们的金钱和工作
{\fs12}Hey. Hey! -money and jobs.

466
00:27:44,787 --> 00:27:45,728
够了
{\fs12}That's enough.

467
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:47,811
我们在这里玩得很开心
{\fs12}We're just having a good time here.

468
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,508
我只是问个简单的学术问题 好吗
{\fs12}Hey, I'm just askin' a simple academic question, all right?

469
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,626
我想你们 - 蒂姆
{\fs12}You know what, I think you guys -Hey, Tim, Tim...

470
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:53,876
最多应该有四分之一的投票权
{\fs12}should have a quarter of a vote at most.

471
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:55,274
这已经相当慷慨了 - 蒂姆
{\fs12}I mean, that's pretty generous. -Tim.

472
00:27:55,376 --> 00:27:56,282
坐吧 蒂姆
{\fs12}Take a seat, Tim.

473
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,657
你为什么不去散散步呢
{\fs12}Whoa, whoa, whoa! -Why don't you take a walk.

474
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,063
冷静点 大家伙
{\fs12}Cool your jets, big guy!

475
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,275
也许是八分之一的投票权
{\fs12}You know what, maybe an eighth of a vote, if that.

476
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,248
你什么都可以小一点 伙计
{\fs12}And you could use a little small, buddy.

477
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:04,461
坐下
{\fs12}Yeah, sit down.

478
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:11,839
我能来杯正常人的正常啤酒吗
{\fs12}Can I get a normal-sized beer for a normal-sized guy?

479
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,761
我一直在想 有没有忘了什么
{\fs12}I keep thinking I forgot something.

480
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,425
搬到城里来 是吗
{\fs12}Moving to town, are you?

481
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:01,708
怎么样啊
{\fs12}How's that?

482
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:04,747
我看你要搬去悠闲乐园了
{\fs12}I see you're moving to Leisureland.

483
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,216
你们像是一对很和善的年轻夫妇
{\fs12}You look like a nice young couple.

484
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:09,317
谢谢
{\fs12}Thanks.

485
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,598

{\fs12}Yeah, you know, uh, a little.

490
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,060
没必要
{\fs12}Don't be.

491
00:30:20,357 --> 00:30:22,740
这是你们做过的 最好的事
{\fs12}It's the best thing you'll ever do.

576
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,557
"我在做什么 "
{\fs12}"What am I doing?"

577

586
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:03,582
等等
{\fs12}Wait.

587
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:06,285
你不能把我留在这里
{\fs12}You're not leaving me here.

588
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,074
你不明白我的感受吗
{\fs12}Can't you understand how I feel?

591
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:14,485
但是
{\fs12}But then-

592
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,852
然后我意识到 我之所以这么做
{\fs12}then I realized I was just doing this

593
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,978
是因为我想让你开心
{\fs12}because I w-I was trying to make you happy and

594
00:41:18,915 --> 00:41:20,712
我应该多考虑一下自己
{\fs12}I should've been thinking more about myself.

考虑自己吗

考虑自己吗
{\fs12}Thinking about yourself?!

597
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,072
你都没问过我怎么样了
{\fs12}You know, you haven't even asked me how I am!

598
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:28,150
别嚷嚷
{\fs12}Don't yell.

599
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,836
别对我大吼大叫 否则我就挂了
{\fs12}Don't yell at me or I'll hang up.

{\fs12}Do you have any idea what I have been through today?

601
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:37,358
奥黛丽 如果你不马上回来
{\fs12}Audrey, if you don't come back here right now...

602
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:40,040
看到你们都这么小吗
{\fs12}And see you all small?

603
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,751
我已经够烦了
{\fs12}I'm upset enough already.

604
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,282
你很心烦吗

607
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:51,727
我们很抱歉听到
{\fs12}Well, we're sure sorry to hear

萨福耐克太太 今天没能来

萨法耐克
{\fs12}Safranek.

611
00:41:56,654 --> 00:41:59,121
先侦察一下 也不算错
{\fs12}Well, it's not a half-bad idea to scout things out

612
00:41:59,146 --> 00:42:00,879
把一切都准备好
{\fs12}get everything ready for her.

613
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:09,397
网挡住了很多紫外线

614
00:42:09,422 --> 00:42:11,296
但你还是要戴上帽子

如果供不应求

你总是可以分享

631
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:41,049
先生 这是你王国的钥匙

但有一件事 我要提醒你的是 乳制品
{\fs12}but one thing I should warn you about is the dairy--

635
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,654
你的胃需要一段时间
{\fs12}it takes a while for your stomach

636
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,911
适应牛奶和奶酪

小心热水
{\fs12}And be careful about the hot water.

是中央系统的 但是控制开关位置太高
{\fs12}It's on one central system and they got that cranked really high.

640
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:03,010
很惊讶 他们还没有起诉
{\fs12}Surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet.

641
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:04,823
别说是我说的
{\fs12}Oh, but you didn't hear that from me.

642
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:06,678
谢谢 马特
{\fs12}Thanks Matt.

643
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:08,762
你是个好人
{\fs12}You're a nice guy.

644
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:13,406
保罗
{\fs12}And Paul?

645
00:44:14,672 --> 00:44:16,196
谢谢你帮助地球
{\fs12}Thanks for helping the planet.

646
00:45:47,253 --> 00:45:48,252
萨法耐克
{\fs12}Safranek?

647
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,644
是我
{\fs12}That's me.

648
00:45:54,883 --> 00:45:55,758
OK
{\fs12}Okay!

649
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,010
现在看看美国
{\fs12}And now from the United States,

650
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:16,641
多年来 国土安全部

和移民归化局
{\fs12}and the Immigration and Naturalization Service

652
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:21,767
鉴于缩小人群的简单化

654

从非法移民到潜在的恐怖分子
{\fs12}from illegal immigrants to potential terrorists--

655
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:27,971
可以穿透美国边境
{\fs12}could penetrate U.S. borders.

656
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,494
上周在俄勒冈州尤金的发现
{\fs12}Last week's discovery in Eugene, Oregon

657
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:33,338

658
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:35,542
布莱恩・菲克勒 带我们去现场
{\fs12}Brian Fakler brings us up to date.

659
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,204
这建筑是全国各地
{\fs12}This Target is just one of

660
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,363
数以千计的大盒子商店之一
{\fs12}thousands of big-box stores around the country

661
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:42,841

662
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,200
大部分来自亚洲
{\fs12}most of it from Asia.

663
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:47,426
上周 尤金的工人打开一个可疑的电视盒
{\fs12}Last week, workers here in Eugene opened a suspicious TV box

664
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:51,014

{\fs12}and discovered 17 downsized stowaways from Vietnam,

665
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,835

两人在当地医院 几小时后死亡
{\fs12}two more dying hours later at a local hospital.

667

{\fs12}On Friday, the lone survivor, a woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,

668
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:03,351

被广泛认为是全国顶尖的缩小者医疗中心
{\fs12}widely considered the country's top medical center for the small.

670
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,867
医生被迫切除了部分被感染的腿部
{\fs12}Doctors were forced to amputate a portion of an infected leg,

671
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:12,998
今天她的情况 据称稳定
{\fs12}and today her condition is described as fair but stable.

672
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:16,000
根据国土安全部的声明
{\fs12}According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security,

673
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:17,654
全女士已被判入狱
{\fs12}Ms. Tran claims to have been jailed

674
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,100
因为她的政治和环境行动主义
{\fs12}for her political and environmental activism,

675
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:21,943
并违反她的意志
{\fs12}and was miniaturized against her will

676
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:23,749
将她关入越南人的监狱设施内
{\fs12}in a Vietnamese prison facility.

677
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,781
如果属实 这将加强人权团体的主张
{\fs12}If true, this would bolster claims by human rights groups

678
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:29,133
世界各地的专制政府...
{\fs12}that repressive governments around the world...

679
00:47:37,017 --> 00:47:40,417
一年后

680
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:43,185
需要重新检视安置条款吗
{\fs12}So, do we need to review any of the terms of the settlement?

681
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:44,316
不
{\fs12}No.

682
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,528
一切都很清楚
{\fs12}It's all pretty clear.

683
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:49,244
我倒希望你们能先缩小她
{\fs12}I really wish you'd taken her first offer.

684
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:50,845
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

685
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:51,948
好吧
{\fs12}All right, well.

686
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:54,816
退后一点 不想让你受伤
{\fs12}Just step back a little. Don't want you to get hurt.

687
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,646
请尽量大
{\fs12}As large as you can, please.

688
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,097
这里天气不错
{\fs12}Nice weather down here.

689
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,411
奥马哈 真的很冷了
{\fs12}Turned real cold back in Omaha.

690
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:29,794
寒风刺骨
{\fs12}Wind chill.

691
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:16,957
保罗
{\fs12}Hey, Paul.

692
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,675
谢了 伙计 你是对的
{\fs12}Thanks, man, you were right.

693
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,552
提高我的监视器 真的很管用
{\fs12}Raising my monitor really did the trick.

694
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:23,038
我脖子感觉好多了 胳膊再也没有刺痛了
{\fs12}My neck feels better, there's no more tingling in my arm.

695
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,734
我从来不曾联系过
{\fs12}I would've never made the connection.

696
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,798
太好了 我很高兴能帮上忙
{\fs12}That's great, I'm really glad I could help.

697
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:31,919
感谢致电"地之角"
{\fs12}Thank you for calling Land's End.

698
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:34,176
我叫保罗 今天我能为您效劳吗
{\fs12}My name is Paul, how can I help you today?

699
00:49:57,478 --> 00:49:58,877
你好 伙计
{\fs12}Ciao, bello.

700
00:49:59,822 --> 00:50:01,088
嗨 卡罗尔
{\fs12}Hi, Carol.

701
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:15,948
伙计
{\fs12}Hey, pal.

702
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,283
为什么要长脸
{\fs12}Why the long face? Huh?

703
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,714
看看周围 伙计 生活是美好的
{\fs12}Look around you, buddy. Life is good.

704
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,729
我犯了个错误 戴夫
{\fs12}I made a mistake, Dave.

705
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:27,096
我一生中最大的错误 应该留在原地
{\fs12}Biggest mistake of my life. Should've stayed where I was.

706
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,816
离婚会让人自尊受到损害
{\fs12}Look, I know divorce can put a dent in anyone's self-esteem.

707
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,488
奥黛丽对你的所作所为 很出格
{\fs12}And what Audrey did to you was beyond the pale.

708
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,675
我是说 我恨她
{\fs12}I mean, I hate her.

709
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:37,324
我几乎不认识她
{\fs12}I-I barely know her.

710
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:39,683
你可能不恨她 但我讨厌她的胆量
{\fs12}You may not hate her, but I hate her guts.

711
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:42,395
你得回复平静 就这样
{\fs12}You, you just gotta get back in the saddle, that's all.

712
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:44,590
也许有一天吧
{\fs12}Ah, maybe someday.

713
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:46,530
听我劝告
{\fs12}If you want my advice,

714
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:48,585
单身妈妈是必经之路
{\fs12}single moms is the way to go.

715
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:51,343
她们不想生孩子
{\fs12}Yeah, they got the whole kid thing out of their system,

716
00:50:51,368 --> 00:50:52,524
她们只想参加派对
{\fs12}and they just wanna party

717
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:53,594
我并不打算...
{\fs12}No, that's okay, I'm--

718
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:55,235
如果你不想建立感情
{\fs12}And if you don't want an emotional connection, which

719
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:57,182
可以理解 你只是
{\fs12}understandable, you just uh

720
00:50:57,252 --> 00:51:00,017
这里有各种各样的休闲方式
{\fs12}well, we have all sorts of ways you can have a good time down here.

721
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:01,330
没有附加条件
{\fs12}No strings attached.

722
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:03,706
刷旧信用卡就好 - 不用 我很好
{\fs12}Just put it on the old credit card. -No, I'm good.

723
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:05,417
真的 - 那好
{\fs12}Really. -Okay, yeah.

724
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,689
事实上 我开始约会了
{\fs12}In fact, I started seeing someone.

725
00:51:07,994 --> 00:51:08,963
是吗
{\fs12}Oh, yeah?

726
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:11,267
其实是单身妈妈
{\fs12}Single mom, actually.

727
00:51:12,021 --> 00:51:14,591
我说的吧 对你有好处
{\fs12}Mm-hmm, now we're talkin'. Good for you.

728
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:24,555
保罗 太好吃了
{\fs12}Paul, this is so good.

729
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,525
谢谢
{\fs12}Thanks.

730
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:29,844
食谱要求山萝卜 但
{\fs12}The recipe called for chervil, but

731
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:31,649
这里没有山萝卜
{\fs12}you can't get chervil here yet.

732
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,774
所以 我用了莳萝
{\fs12}So, I used dill. -Hm.

733
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,029
不管是什么 都超级美味
{\fs12}Well, whatever it is, it's super-yummy.

734
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,635
全都是小玩意
{\fs12}It's the little things, you know?

735
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:44,439
我是说除了没有鸟和昆虫
{\fs12}I mean, except for there being no birds or insects,

736
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:45,823
你会认为你是在正常的世界
{\fs12}you'd think you're in the normal world

737
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,214
然后有事发生
{\fs12}and then somethin' happens

738
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:48,879
于是意识到我们并非
{\fs12}and you realize we're not.

739
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:50,940
我并不是抱怨 用莳萝取代山萝卜
{\fs12}I mean, not that substituting dill for chervil

740
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:53,097
那根本不算什么 但你懂我意思
{\fs12}is that big a thing, but you know what I mean.

741
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:54,632
就像上个月
{\fs12}Like last month,

742
00:51:54,717 --> 00:51:56,857
我父母来看望乔纳和我
{\fs12}my parents came down to visit Jonah and me--

743
00:51:57,805 --> 00:51:59,555
我们是装在运输箱里的
{\fs12}and it's like this whole production

744
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:02,500
小玩意 于是乔纳被吓坏了
{\fs12}with the carrying boxes, and of course Jonah gets freaked out

745
00:52:02,525 --> 00:52:05,301
外婆外公这么大 很吓人
{\fs12}by Grandma and Grandpa being so huge and scary.

746
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,048
一天晚上 他们带我们去弗莱明家吃晚餐
{\fs12}One night they took us out for dinner at Fleming's,

747
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:09,647
真的很好
{\fs12}you know, real nice, -Mm-hmm.

748
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:12,983
乔纳坐在桌子上
{\fs12}and Jonah and are sitting on the table

749
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,518
坐在特殊的座位上
{\fs12}in those special seats.

750
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,214
巨人们一直盯着我们看
{\fs12}And the big people wouldn't stop staring at us.

751
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:20,608
另外 这家餐馆吹嘘受小人们欢迎的程度
{\fs12}Plus, the restaurant brags about how small people are welcome,

752
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:22,514
然后 他们得到了大量的小人顾客
{\fs12}and then they charge a huge minimum.

753
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:23,985
他们应该收取巨人们额外的费用
{\fs12}They should charge big people extra.

754
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:25,671
他们是拖累世界的人
{\fs12}They're the ones dragging down the world.

755
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:26,587
我知道
{\fs12}I know.

756
00:52:26,689 --> 00:52:28,337
巨人们看着我们 就像我们是怪胎
{\fs12}Big people look at us like we're freaks.

757
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:29,807
他们才是怪胎
{\fs12}They're the freaks.

758
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:33,267
听说过南极洲释放的气体吗
{\fs12}Oh, did you hear about all that gas being released in Antarctica?

759
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,330
来自于冰山 甲烷
{\fs12}From the ice? The methane?

760
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,995
最近我没怎么关注过新闻
{\fs12}Oh, I haven't really been following the news that much lately.

761
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:39,682
很显然这是个大事
{\fs12}Apparently it's a big deal.

762
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:42,017
科学家说 冰融化的越多
{\fs12}Scientists are saying the more the ice melts,

763
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:44,869
更多的甲烷会使冰融化
{\fs12}the more methane comes out making more ice melt.

764
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:47,714
很显然 我们已经超越了临界点
{\fs12}Apparently we're already way beyond the tipping--

765
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:52,797
是我楼上的邻居
{\fs12}It's my upstairs neighbor.

766
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:56,015
超级奇怪 我有几个月没有看到他了
{\fs12}Well, it's the strangest thing, I-there wasn't a peep for months

767
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,289
我甚至不认为他还住在这里
{\fs12}I don't even think he was here--

768
00:52:57,314 --> 00:52:59,522
然后突然间

你介意把音乐关了吗
{\fs12}You mind turning down the music?

776
00:53:19,912 --> 00:53:22,629
我想在这里安安静静地过一个晚上

794
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,545
那是一朵玫瑰吗
{\fs12}Is that a rose?

795
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:08,811
是的 - 一朵真正的玫瑰
{\fs12}Yeah. -A real rose?

796
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,128
你在哪里买的真玫瑰啊

00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:18,692
他们要价多少
{\fs12}How much they're charging for this?

799
00:54:19,294 --> 00:54:20,239
杜尚
{\fs12}Dusan!

{\fs12}Don't make big show like last time,

809
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:47,327
像疯子一样大喊大叫
{\fs12}yelling like crazy man.

810
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:50,235
我们是邻居 邻居是朋友
{\fs12}We're neighbors. Neighbors are friends.

811
00:54:50,314 --> 00:54:52,720
还有什么更好的 来参加派对吧
{\fs12}What's better even, come to the party.

{\fs12}Plus the cooking and all.

820
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,901
对不起 我不得不这么早离开 因为保姆
{\fs12}Sorry I have to leave so early, but you know, the sitter...

821
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:19,841
没关系
{\fs12}Yeah, yeah. No...

822
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:21,584
我曾经...
{\fs12}I was...

823
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,856
上一层
{\fs12}Up one floor.

824
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:27,528

{\fs12}What?

825
00:55:27,553 --> 00:55:28,370

{\fs12}Yeah, one more.

826
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:29,848
谢谢 - 谢谢
{\fs12}Gracias -Oh, gracias, tio.

827
00:55:35,408 --> 00:55:37,009
总之
{\fs12}Anyway, uh,

828
00:55:37,064 --> 00:55:40,134
我希望 星期日我们可以带乔纳来
{\fs12}I was hoping uh, Sunday we could bring Jonah.

829
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,588
我 我很想见见他
{\fs12}I... I'd love to meet him.

830
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,479
好的
{\fs12}Yeah...maybe.

831
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:02,138
有什么不对劲吗 没有
{\fs12}Something wrong? -No.

832
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:05,975
你是个好人 保罗
{\fs12}You're a wonderful guy, Paul.

833
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,514
我很喜欢和你在一起
{\fs12}And I really enjoy hanging out with you.

834
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:13,107
但我诚实来讲
{\fs12}But, if I'm honest about how I'm feeling,

835
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:16,341
我只是 可能....
{\fs12}I just-it might be uh-- it might be too soon for me.

836
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:17,522

00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:18,967
不 不 - 我明白了 没事的
{\fs12}No, no... -I get it. No, it's fine.

838
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:21,718
我是说 如果乔纳卷入的话
{\fs12}I just mean if we're bringing Jonah into it...

839
00:56:22,098 --> 00:56:23,426
晚上愉快
{\fs12}Have a nice night.

840
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:24,747
不 我
{\fs12}No, I...

841
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:26,364

{\fs12}A rose!

843
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:13,015
保罗
{\fs12}Paul!

844
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,043
你来了
{\fs12}You come.

845
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,641
还带了玫瑰
{\fs12}And you bring the rose.

846
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:21,055
这是和平的表示
{\fs12}It's a peace offering. -Oh.

847
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:22,788
大家 听着
{\fs12}Look, everyone.

848
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:24,632
这是保罗 我的邻居
{\fs12}This is Paul, my neighbor.

849
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:26,070
看看他给我带来了什么
{\fs12}And look at what he brings me.

850
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:27,929
一朵真玫瑰
{\fs12}A real fucking rose!

851
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:32,061
你认为这些忘恩负义的混蛋
{\fs12}You think any of these other ungrateful sons of bitches

852
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:33,928
会带东西给杜尚吗
{\fs12}think to bring something to Dusan?

853
00:57:33,976 --> 00:57:35,577
不 你是唯一一个
{\fs12}No. You're the only one.

854
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:36,702
我喜欢你
{\fs12}I like you.

855
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:41,310
但我说过 这只是个小派对
{\fs12}But, I know I said it's only little party,

856
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:43,607
但我只打了两三个电话 给非常亲密的朋友
{\fs12}but I make two, three phone calls to very close friends,

857
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:44,748
看看结果
{\fs12}look what happens.

858
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:45,987
每个人都来了
{\fs12}Everybody comes.

859
00:57:46,012 --> 00:57:49,964
10点后 在这该死的城市里 没有别的事可做了
{\fs12}There's nothing else to do in this fucking city after 10 o'clock.

860
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:52,707
现在 我不明白
{\fs12}Now, this I do not understand.

861
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:56,277
难道没有人上早班吗
{\fs12}It's not as if so many people have work in the morning.

862
00:57:56,311 --> 00:57:58,967
这是小人最糟糕的特质
{\fs12}You know, this is worst trait about small people--

863
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:00,513
他们很懒
{\fs12}they're lazy.

864
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:03,076
不是全部 但懒惰
{\fs12}Not all, not all. But lazy.

865
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,404
就像 这个懒鬼
{\fs12}Like...this lazy son of a bitch.

866
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,043
康拉德
{\fs12}Konrad!

867
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,621
你在说我什么
{\fs12}What's that you're saying about me?

868
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,293
你吹什么牛呢
{\fs12}What lies are you telling?

869
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:15,037
只是在小世界里 没有人愿意工作
{\fs12}Just that in small world no one wants to work.

870
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:16,287
你想怎么样
{\fs12}What did you expect?

871
00:58:16,443 --> 00:58:19,169
变小是件美妙的事
{\fs12}It's the wonderful thing about becoming small.

872
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:20,955
因为你马上就有钱了
{\fs12}Because you're immediately rich.

873
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,885
除非你很穷
{\fs12}Unless you're very poor.

874
00:58:23,096 --> 00:58:25,183
那你就是真的小了
{\fs12}Then you're just small.

875
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:27,659
康拉德是远洋船长
{\fs12}Konrad's a sea captain.

876
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:31,358
离他的船不超过十米
{\fs12}Never more than ten meters away from his boat.

877
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,155
我喜欢我的船
{\fs12}I do like my boat.

878
00:58:35,665 --> 00:58:37,032
她在那儿
{\fs12}There she is.

879
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:39,204
索尼娅 我的美人
{\fs12}Sonja, my beauty.

880
00:58:39,498 --> 00:58:43,555
你看 我是世代之家
{\fs12}You see, I'm from many generations.

881
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:46,688
我的祖父 我的父亲
{\fs12}All the way back to my grandfathers, my father--

882
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:47,985
全都是船长
{\fs12}all sea captains.

883
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:51,539
什么风把你吹来了 悠闲乐园
{\fs12}So, what brings you to Leisureland?

884
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:52,689
杜尚
{\fs12}Dusan.

885
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:55,389
他说服我变小的
{\fs12}He even convinced me to become small,

886
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:59,209
主要是为妇女和政党
{\fs12}mostly for the women and the parties.

887
00:58:59,395 --> 00:59:03,270
坦白地说我妻子有钱
{\fs12}And, frankly, my wife had all the money,

888
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,282
她走后 事情变得有点棘手
{\fs12}and after she left, things became a bit tricky.

889
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,087
我能理解
{\fs12}Oh, I can relate.

890
00:59:08,584 --> 00:59:12,084
变小很棒 你不觉得吗
{\fs12}It's quite wonderful to be small, don't you think?

891
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,537
我会说 各有优缺点
{\fs12}I'd say it has its pluses and minuses.

892
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:18,012
下周我会在塞舌尔
{\fs12}Next week I'll be in the Seychelles,

893
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:20,332
两周后我会
{\fs12}and two weeks after that, I'll be

894
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:23,499
和朋友去的的喀喀湖 航行一个月
{\fs12}sailing with friends for a month on Lake Titicaca.

895
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,922
能相信我从没去过的的喀喀湖吗
{\fs12}Can you believe I've never been to Lake Titicaca?

896
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,662
那船如何迁移呢
{\fs12}Well, how does the boat get from place to place?

897
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:31,178
我是说你不能航行
{\fs12}I mean, you can't sail it.

898
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,443
联邦快递 我亲爱的孩子
{\fs12}FedEx, my dear boy.

899
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:36,488

有我这样的令人兴奋的邻居
{\fs12}to have exciting neighbor such as me.

934
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:39,929
我从没参加过这样的派对
{\fs12}Well, I've never been to a party like that.

935
01:05:39,954 --> 01:05:41,845
好多欧洲人
{\fs12}I've nev-there were so many Europeans.

936
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:44,052
你知道 小罗尼在这里吗 我是说
{\fs12}Did you know little Ronni was here? I mean...

937

忠于他的民族历史
{\fs12}but... historic.

943
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,481
很明显他还住在原来的殖民地
{\fs12}Well, apparently he still lives in the original colony, you know,

944
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,989
在挪威 我一直想去看看
{\fs12}over in Norway. I've always wanted to see that.

945
01:06:07,161 --> 01:06:08,364

离开这个恶心的小公寓
{\fs12}get out of this disgusting little fucking apartment

958
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,836
去开阔眼界
{\fs12}and open your eyes.

959
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,594
别那么美国
{\fs12}Don't be so American.

你是个好人 保罗

昨晚你跳舞 你笑
{\fs12}Last night you dance, you laugh

963
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:47,885
但你内心却在哭泣
{\fs12}but inside you cry.

964
01:06:50,038 --> 01:06:51,749
你凭什么跟我这样说话
{\fs12}Who are you to talk to me that way?

965
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,147
我是杜尚・米尔科维奇 你的邻居
{\fs12}I'm Dusan Mirkovic, your neighbor.

966
01:06:55,187 --> 01:06:56,303
邻居是朋友
{\fs12}Neighbors are friends.

967
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:57,842
朋友告诉朋友真相
{\fs12}Friends tell friends the truth.

968
01:06:59,387 --> 01:07:01,816
好吧 也许有时候我有点混蛋
{\fs12}Okay, maybe sometimes I'm a little bit asshole,

969
01:07:01,842 --> 01:07:03,677
但世界需要混蛋
{\fs12}but the world needs assholes.

970
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:05,468
否则何处可发泄呢

再见 - 谢谢
{\fs12}Bye. -Thank you.

973
01:07:16,035 --> 01:07:17,809
当我想到巨人们变得微型
{\fs12}When I think of big people becoming small

974
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,630
出现了各种新的微型城市
{\fs12}Mm-mm. -all the new small cities

975
01:07:19,655 --> 01:07:22,006
在这个世界上 我瞅到的是机会
{\fs12}in the world, I see opportunity.

976
01:07:22,229 --> 01:07:24,792
我问我自己 杜尚
{\fs12}I ask myself, Dusan,

977
01:07:24,924 --> 01:07:27,463
为什么人们想要变得微型呢
{\fs12}why the people they want to become small?

978
01:07:27,612 --> 01:07:28,995
是改善环境吗
{\fs12}To help the environment?

979
01:07:29,073 --> 01:07:30,409
得了
{\fs12}Please.

980
01:07:30,434 --> 01:07:32,785
变得小 才能享受
{\fs12}The become small to have the things

981
01:07:32,811 --> 01:07:34,693
直到现在 只为富人的东西
{\fs12}which until now were only for the rich,

982
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:37,497
顺便一说 这是个天才概念
{\fs12}which, by the way, is the genius of the concept.

983
01:07:38,022 --> 01:07:42,279
所以我对我兄弟斯尔詹说...我们兄弟一起工作
{\fs12}So I say to my brother Srdjan-- I work with my brother.

984
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:43,814
他现在还是巨人
{\fs12}He's still big.

985
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:45,720
顺便 我的妻子也是
{\fs12}My wife, too, by the way.

986
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,043
我说
{\fs12}I say,

987
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:50,082
为什么不用非常特殊的物品
{\fs12}why not bring very special items,

988
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,809
奢侈品 提供给微型消费者呢
{\fs12}luxury items, to the small consumer?

989
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:56,638
没有人想过的东西
{\fs12}The-The things that nobody else is thinking to bring?

990
01:07:57,222 --> 01:07:58,237
比如
{\fs12}Such as?

991
01:07:58,628 --> 01:08:01,526
例如 古巴雪茄
{\fs12}Well, Cohiba Esplendido.

992
01:08:01,566 --> 01:08:03,816
古巴 世界上最好的雪茄
{\fs12}Cuba. Best cigar in the world.

993
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,051
你巨人时 付多少钱呢
{\fs12}How much you pay for this when you big?

994
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:08,168
四十五 五十美元
{\fs12}Forty-five, fifty dollars.

995
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,537
当你微型时 我卖给你这支雪茄
{\fs12}When you small, I sell you this cigar

996
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:12,076
一美元
{\fs12}for one dollar.

997
01:08:12,424 --> 01:08:16,713
用一支大雪茄 我们制作了大约2000支微型雪茄
{\fs12}And from this one Cohiba, we make about 2,000 cigars.

998
01:08:17,017 --> 01:08:20,345
好吧 也许它们不是古巴制造的
{\fs12}Okay, maybe they're not actually made in Cuba.

999
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:23,694
也许他们是由布亚诺瓦茨的微型阿尔巴尼亚人卷制的
{\fs12}Maybe they're rolled by little Albanians in Bujanovac

1000
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:24,781
但谁在乎呢
{\fs12}but who cares?

1001
01:08:24,827 --> 01:08:26,531
这只是其中之一
{\fs12}And this is just one thing.

都是合法的吗
{\fs12}Is all that legal?

1005
01:08:35,705 --> 01:08:38,713
宝贝 这是狂野西部
{\fs12}Baby, this is Wild West.

1006
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:41,021
谁有时间追逐一些

{\fs12}Anything, anytime.

1013
01:08:57,927 --> 01:08:59,201
失陪一下
{\fs12}Excuse me a minute.

1014
01:09:13,503 --> 01:09:14,550
你好
{\fs12}Hello?

1015
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:19,410

1283
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:51,875

{\fs12}It's a long story, we're sorting it out.

1284
01:25:51,908 --> 01:25:53,205

1287
01:26:08,885 --> 01:26:11,400
饿死了 谢谢
{\fs12}Ay, sí, chinita. Gracias.

1288
01:26:13,742 --> 01:26:15,602
上帝会报答你的
{\fs12}God will repay you.

1289
01:26:15,867 --> 01:26:17,508
你的肺怎么样
{\fs12}How's your lung?

1290
01:26:18,234 --> 01:26:20,039
你的肺怎么样
{\fs12}How's your lung?

1291
01:26:20,326 --> 01:26:22,701
我今天感觉好一点了
{\fs12}I feel a little better today.

1292
01:26:22,951 --> 01:26:24,076
谢谢
{\fs12}Gracias.

1293
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:25,397

{\fs12}Bueno.

1294
01:26:25,726 --> 01:26:28,022
好了 过来 这边
{\fs12}Okay, over here, this way.

1295
01:26:33,994 --> 01:26:35,416
很痛吧
{\fs12}Mucho dolor, verdad?

1296
01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:36,768
是的 很痛
{\fs12}Yes, it hurts a lot.

1297
01:26:36,803 --> 01:26:38,249
看起来真的很痛
{\fs12}Oh, it looks really painful.

1298
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:40,174
我给他洗澡和擦洗
{\fs12}I give him baths and scrub him

1299
01:26:40,309 --> 01:26:43,543
敷草药 但没有什么用
{\fs12}and put herbs, but nothing helps.

1300
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,497
我肯定那是癣
{\fs12}I bet that's ringworm

1301
01:26:46,522 --> 01:26:48,005
我不知道怎么用西班牙语说
{\fs12}which I don't know how to say in Spanish.

1302
01:26:48,044 --> 01:26:50,716
但癣是一种真菌 所以
{\fs12}But ringworm is a fungus, so

1303
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:52,091
必须保持干燥
{\fs12}you want it dry.

1304
01:26:52,146 --> 01:26:55,466
干燥 不要洗澡
{\fs12}Seco. Seco. No ba?o. No ba?o. No agua. No agua.

1305
01:26:56,528 --> 01:26:58,014
看看我能不能在药店买点东西
{\fs12}see if I can pick something up at the drugstore

1306
01:26:58,039 --> 01:26:59,256
明天给他带来

1307
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:00,419
是的 你带

1314
01:27:13,887 --> 01:27:14,934

{\fs12}Take care for him.

1315
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:16,645
下一次见 谢谢
{\fs12}See you next time. -Gracias.

1316
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,967
就这样了吧 现在回家吗
{\fs12}So that's it? We go home now?

1317
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:22,225
现在我们去教堂 祈祷上帝
{\fs12}Now we go church pray Jesus.

1321
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:09,677
早上好 杜尚先生 我们为你而来
{\fs12}Good morning, Mr. Dusan. We come clean for you.

1322
01:28:30,186 --> 01:28:33,381
接电话对你来说不够高贵
{\fs12}Answering telephones was not dignified enough for you.

1323
01:28:33,406 --> 01:28:35,780
现在你进步到打扫厕所了
{\fs12}Now you progress to cleaning toilets.

1324
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:37,498
我爱你 保罗
{\fs12}I love you, Paul.

1325

搞笑
{\fs12}Hilarious.

1327
01:28:42,307 --> 01:28:43,722
就像我说的
{\fs12}Like I said,

1328
01:28:43,747 --> 01:28:46,002
你是个好人
{\fs12}you're too much nice guy

1329
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:48,889
还有一点 可悲
{\fs12}and a little bit...pathetic guy.

1330
01:28:48,928 --> 01:28:50,647
直到她得到新脚为止
{\fs12}It's just until she gets a new foot.

1331
01:28:50,703 --> 01:28:52,359
那是什么时候 - 我不知道
{\fs12}When will that be. -I don't know.

1332
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:54,721
医生说一个月 也许六周
{\fs12}The doctor said a month, maybe six weeks.

1333
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:56,909
那就是永恒 - 我知道
{\fs12}Ah, that's an eternity. -I know.

1334
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:58,999
同时她被腿困住了
{\fs12}Meantime she's stuck with a peg leg,

1335
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:01,218
几乎和一无所有一样惨
{\fs12}which is almost as bad as having nothing at all.

1336
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:02,210
看看她
{\fs12}I mean, look at her,

1337
01:29:02,257 --> 01:29:04,413
她就像个该死的海盗一样 到处蹒跚
{\fs12}she's waddling around like a goddamned pirate!

1338
01:29:06,366 --> 01:29:08,741
保罗 你别跟杜尚先生拌嘴了
{\fs12}Paul! You no talk with Mr. Dusan!

1339
01:29:08,835 --> 01:29:10,585
你跟维罗尼卡上楼去
{\fs12}You go upstairs with Veronica!

1340
01:29:11,576 --> 01:29:13,380
保罗 - 我听到了
{\fs12}Paul! -I heard you.

1341
01:29:13,827 --> 01:29:15,460
别担心 保罗
{\fs12}Don't worry, Paul.

1342
01:29:18,217 --> 01:29:19,967
杜尚会救你的
{\fs12}Dusan will save you.

1343
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,792
陈小姐 把一切都拿走
{\fs12}Yeah, Miss Tran, take everything.

1344
01:29:38,804 --> 01:29:41,882
康拉德先生和我后天离开
{\fs12}Mr. Konrad and I are leaving day after tomorrow

1345
01:29:41,984 --> 01:29:44,124
不知道什么时候回来
{\fs12}and don't know when we'll be back.

1346
01:29:44,937 --> 01:29:46,906
好吧 谢谢
{\fs12}Okay good. Thank you.

1347

1348
01:29:48,986 --> 01:29:50,515

1351
01:29:56,935 --> 01:29:57,841

1352
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,209
情况就是这样

01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:02,545
我不知道到底是什么
{\fs12}I don't know exactly what,

绝密 非常紧急
{\fs12}Top secret and... very urgent.

1361

最重要的是 他们开价很高

巨额

1363
01:30:25,373 --> 01:30:28,145
这意味着我们需要额外的帮助

1440
01:35:49,537 --> 01:35:51,021
你不知道有多可怕
{\fs12}You have no idea how terribly

1441
01:35:51,047 --> 01:35:54,031
悲痛欲绝 我们造成了陈小姐的案例
{\fs12}grief-stricken we were by Miss Tran's case.

1442
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:58,112
乔根因为所有的滥用行为 夜不能寐
{\fs12}Jorgen has lost so much sleep over all the abuses.

1443
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:10,253
很惭愧吧
{\fs12}It's humbling, huh?

1444
01:36:11,167 --> 01:36:14,488
大自然是好耐心的雕塑家
{\fs12}Nature is such a patient sculptor.

1445
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:16,649
磨一小点
{\fs12}Grinding a tiny bit

1446
01:36:16,781 --> 01:36:20,766

1447
01:36:20,845 --> 01:36:24,751
造出了超级美丽的万物
{\fs12}make such a supremely beautiful thing.

1448
01:36:27,317 --> 01:36:28,629
真是浪费
{\fs12}What a waste.

1449

多么可怕的浪费

1450
01:36:43,554 --> 01:36:45,310
请原谅乔根

过去的几天尤其煎熬
{\fs12}These past few days has been especially hard.

{\fs12}Such a big decision to make and so quickly.

1453
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:54,336
通常当我们访问殖民地时
{\fs12}Normally when we visit the Colony,

1454
01:36:54,361 --> 01:36:56,935
我们喜欢在霍宁斯沃格呆几天
{\fs12}we like to spend a few days in Honningsv?g.

1455
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,532

突然赶来
{\fs12}suddenly imposing on you.

1458
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:06,559
我们几乎没有时间收拾行李
{\fs12}We scarcely had the time to pack.

1459
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:09,547
对不起 有什么消息
{\fs12}I'm sorry, w-what news?

1460
01:37:10,485 --> 01:37:12,500
甲烷释放
{\fs12}Why, the methane release.

1461
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:15,328
在南极 你必须懂得甲烷
{\fs12}In Antarctica. You must know about the methane.

1462
01:37:16,182 --> 01:37:17,112
是的
{\fs12}Yeah...

1463
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:20,120
这并不算新闻 不是吗
{\fs12}that's not-that's not new, is it? I mean--

1464
01:37:20,509 --> 01:37:22,017
新闻或旧闻

1465
01:37:22,908 --> 01:37:24,229
结束了

1466
01:37:25,638 --> 01:37:28,138
一切都结束了
{\fs12}It's the end of everything.

1467
01:37:30,466 --> 01:37:34,731
世界出现过五次大灭绝
{\fs12}The world has already seen five major extinctions,

1468
01:37:34,942 --> 01:37:36,591
现在会有另一个
{\fs12}and now there will be another.

1469
01:37:37,068 --> 01:37:39,154
我 我不想相信
{\fs12}I...I didn't want to believe it.

1470
01:37:39,248 --> 01:37:40,740
我们全都不相信 但
{\fs12}None of us did, but

1471

{\fs12}26 Nobel Prize winners among us.

1475

我们建立了所有的模型 做了所有的数学
{\fs12}We built all the models, did all the math,

1476
01:37:58,518 --> 01:38:01,213
所有的结论都是一致的
{\fs12}and all conclusion was consistent.

1477
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:05,319
智人很快就会从地球上消失
{\fs12}Homo Sapiens will soon vanish from the Earth.

1478
01:38:06,608 --> 01:38:09,413
具有精算的确定性
{\fs12}It is now an actuarial certainty.

1479
01:38:10,796 --> 01:38:13,031
不管结局会如何
{\fs12}No matter how the end will come--

核冬天 或其组合
{\fs12}nuclear winter, some combination of them all.

1485
01:38:26,653 --> 01:38:32,223
相对地 很快 地球将真正地清洗人类
{\fs12}Relatively soon the Earth will indeed purge itself of human life,

1486
01:38:33,115 --> 01:38:35,896
天知道还有多少物种
{\fs12}and God knows how many other species.

1487
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:40,310
真的意味着灭绝吗 那微型人呢
{\fs12}Do you really mean extinction? What about downsizing?

1488
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,264
是啊 太晚了
{\fs12}Yeah, yeah, too little too late.

1489
01:38:42,428 --> 01:38:45,506
世界上只有3% 的人微型化
{\fs12}Only three percent of the world has miniaturized.

1490
01:38:45,701 --> 01:38:47,936
根本没有足够的时间
{\fs12}There simply isn't enough time.

1491
01:38:51,576 --> 01:38:55,521
不是一个非常成功的物种 这些智人
{\fs12}Not a very successful species, these Homo Sapiens,

1492
01:38:55,685 --> 01:38:58,481
即使有这么大的智慧

仅仅20万年

1498
01:39:16,271 --> 01:39:18,060
现在真的发生了
{\fs12}And now it's really happening.

1499
01:39:20,684 --> 01:39:23,059
我想 未来一定有人会猜中的
{\fs12}I guess somebody had to be right someday.

1500
01:39:24,607 --> 01:39:25,724
很痛苦
{\fs12}So sad.

1501
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:28,670
极其痛苦
{\fs12}Very sad.

1502
01:39:43,073 --> 01:39:44,769

我很好
{\fs12}I fine.

1507
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:58,560
也许我该看看你的腿
{\fs12}You know, maybe I should take a look at your leg.

1508
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,630
好吧 你看
{\fs12}Okay, yes, you look.

1509
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:11,716
这种木钉真的使皮肤擦伤了

鸟儿 它们更喜欢旅鼠

01:44:52,512 --> 01:44:53,872
乔根
{\fs12}Jorgen!

1541
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,833
安妮-海琳
{\fs12}Anne-Helene!

1542
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:57,640
谢天谢地你来了
{\fs12}Oh, thank God you're here!

1543
01:44:57,665 --> 01:45:00,329
为什么没人告诉我
{\fs12}Why didn't anyone tell me?

1544
01:45:00,691 --> 01:45:03,956
我太爱你了
{\fs12}Oh, I love you so much.

1545
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:07,646
我很爱你们俩
{\fs12}I love you both so much.

1546
01:45:07,929 --> 01:45:10,076
自从这个决定之后
{\fs12}Oh, ever since the decision,

1547
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:12,179
没有你们在这里 我感觉不太好
{\fs12}I didn't feel right without you here.

1548
01:45:12,204 --> 01:45:14,267
你知道 当我担心时
{\fs12}And you know how I am when I worry.

1549
01:45:14,292 --> 01:45:16,235
我不能吃 我睡不着
{\fs12}I can't eat. I can't sleep.

1550
01:45:16,261 --> 01:45:18,463
随便问 他们都会告诉你的
{\fs12}Ask anyone here, they tell you.

1551
01:45:18,488 --> 01:45:20,639
抱歉打扰了 乔根
{\fs12}Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

1552
01:45:20,664 --> 01:45:22,882
但我们需要你的建议
{\fs12}but we need your advice immediately.

1553
01:45:22,907 --> 01:45:24,718
是的 对不起 索尔维格
{\fs12}Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

1554
01:45:24,743 --> 01:45:28,062
当然亲爱的 你有重要的事情要做
{\fs12}Of course, darling. You've got important things to do.

1555
01:45:29,216 --> 01:45:32,231
杜尚 杜尚 杜尚
{\fs12}Oh! Dusan, Dusan, Dusan!

1556
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:35,303
保佑你这么快赶来
{\fs12}Bless you for coming so quickly.

1557
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,912
索尔维格 亲爱的 我一直很乐意帮忙
{\fs12}Solveig, my darling, I'm always happy to help

1558
01:45:40,937 --> 01:45:43,780
困难时 容易时 快乐时
{\fs12}in difficult times, in easy times, in happy times.

1559
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:47,182
来拜访你和你可爱的村庄 总是愉快的
{\fs12}Is always a pleasure to come and visit you and your lovely village.

1560
01:45:47,265 --> 01:45:50,038
很可爱 不是吗
{\fs12}Oh, it is lovely, isn't it?

1561
01:45:50,173 --> 01:45:53,485
我不忍以为我再也看不到它了
{\fs12}I can't bear to think I won't see it again.

1562
01:45:53,939 --> 01:45:56,665
我是那个促成殖民地的人
{\fs12}You know, I'm the one who made this colony

1563
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:58,649
很可能是第一个人
{\fs12}possible in the first place.

1564
01:45:58,767 --> 01:46:01,524
我还是个孩子时 就来了
{\fs12}I've been coming since I was just a baby.

1565
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:03,845
我记得有一次
{\fs12}I remember one time--

1566
01:46:04,642 --> 01:46:07,244
等等 我认识你
{\fs12}Wait. I know you.

1567
01:46:07,681 --> 01:46:10,025
你昨晚在我梦里
{\fs12}You were in my dream last night.

1568
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:15,095
你是匹马或小马...很强壮的东西
{\fs12}You were a horse or a pony-- something very strong.

1569
01:46:15,244 --> 01:46:20,166
我骑着你 穿过危险的森林
{\fs12}And I mounted you and rode you through a dangerous forest.

1570
01:46:21,135 --> 01:46:23,799
好 - 而你真的来了
{\fs12}Okay. -And here you are.

1571
01:46:23,917 --> 01:46:25,612
就在我们离开之前
{\fs12}Right before we leave.

1572
01:46:26,245 --> 01:46:28,143
又一个奇迹
{\fs12}Another miracle.

1573
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:31,488
你要和我们一起去 是吗
{\fs12}You are coming with us, aren't you?

1574
01:46:31,893 --> 01:46:33,330
你们要去哪里
{\fs12}Where are you going?

1575
01:46:35,011 --> 01:46:36,120
去那里
{\fs12}In there.

1576
01:46:36,815 --> 01:46:38,300
你想看看吗
{\fs12}Would you like to see?

1577
01:46:50,559 --> 01:46:51,801
通往哪里
{\fs12}Where this go?

1578
01:46:52,293 --> 01:46:53,793
到金库
{\fs12}To the vault.

1579
01:46:54,918 --> 01:46:56,512
金库 - 是的
{\fs12}The vault? -Oh, yes.

1580
01:46:56,762 --> 01:47:00,113
我们几乎从一开始就在努力
{\fs12}We've been working on it almost since the very beginning.

1581
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:02,958
当乔根 有了他的大发现
{\fs12}When Jorgen made his big discovery,

1582
01:47:03,005 --> 01:47:05,950
我说 听着 乔根 你是个天才
{\fs12}I said, look, Jorgen, you're a genius,

1583
01:47:06,076 --> 01:47:10,521
缩小是个天才的主意 没有人质疑这一点
{\fs12}and downsizing is a genius idea. No one is questioning that.

1584
01:47:10,646 --> 01:47:14,256
但是如果人们不接受呢
{\fs12}But what if people don't accept it?

1585
01:47:14,318 --> 01:47:17,178
如果它不按时公诸于世怎么办
{\fs12}What if it doesn't come out on time?

1586
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:20,195
不管怎么说 这是他们想出的
{\fs12}Anyway, this is what they came up with.

1587
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:22,119
根据我的建议
{\fs12}On my suggestion.

1588
01:47:22,594 --> 01:47:26,734
托瓦尔 请带我们的朋友们 一次小小的旅行
{\fs12}Torvald, be a sweetheart and give our friends a little tour.

1589
01:47:27,445 --> 01:47:28,695
当然
{\fs12}Well, sure.

1590
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:30,959
隧道通向金库
{\fs12}The tunnel leads to a vault

1591
01:47:30,984 --> 01:47:34,258
地球岩石圈内部1.6 公里
{\fs12}1.6 kilometers inside the Earth's lithosphere

1592
01:47:34,308 --> 01:47:37,597
并被包裹在双层镍625中
{\fs12}and is encased in a double layer of Inconel 625.

1593
01:47:37,839 --> 01:47:41,582
除了维持广泛的生物多样性外
{\fs12}In addition to maintaining a broad spectrum of biodiversity,

1594
01:47:41,738 --> 01:47:45,410
金库里有种植食物的田地
{\fs12}the vault is equipped with fields for growing foods,

1595
01:47:45,435 --> 01:47:49,207
为了木材的森林 为了畜牧的畜牧业
{\fs12}forests for lumber, livestock for animal husbandry.

1596
01:47:49,312 --> 01:47:52,216
住区宽敞
{\fs12}The residential areas are spacious

1597
01:47:52,241 --> 01:47:55,874
为子孙后代提供 并易于扩展
{\fs12}and easily expandable to provide for future generations.

1598
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,059
等等 是不是全在地下啊
{\fs12}Wait, but that's not all underground?

1599
01:48:00,122 --> 01:48:01,059
是的
{\fs12}Oh, yes!

1600
01:48:01,106 --> 01:48:04,442
我们的微型人尺寸 使其成为可能
{\fs12}Our new small size makes it possible.

1601
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:07,397
否则 我们不可能把梦想保存
{\fs12}Otherwise we never could have dreamed of preserving

1602
01:48:07,423 --> 01:48:11,091
在一个如此多样性的安全地
{\fs12}so much of the world in a single safe place.

1603
01:48:11,348 --> 01:48:12,888
这太棒了
{\fs12}This is brilliant.

1604
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:17,021
棒吗 就像挪亚方舟
{\fs12}Isn't this brilliant? It's like- It's like Noah's Ark.

1605
01:48:17,270 --> 01:48:20,232
完全 就是挪亚方舟
{\fs12}Yes. exactly! It's Noah's Ark!

1606
01:48:20,342 --> 01:48:23,107
那么 能源是什么 是核动力吗
{\fs12}So, how-what do you do for power, is it nuclear?

1607
01:48:23,225 --> 01:48:25,420
不 不 100% 地热
{\fs12}No, no, 100% geothermal.

1608
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:27,720
我们有可互操作的有机系统
{\fs12}And we have interoperable organic systems

1609
01:48:27,745 --> 01:48:30,392
管理人造阳光下的生产
{\fs12}to manage production of artificial sunlight,

1610
01:48:30,478 --> 01:48:34,580
氧气、二氧化碳消除、净水等
{\fs12}oxygen, CO2 elimination, water purification, and so on.

1611
01:48:37,323 --> 01:48:39,417
要在下面呆多久
{\fs12}And how long will you stay down there?

1612
01:48:39,831 --> 01:48:43,479
托瓦尔 预计多久 8000年吗
{\fs12}Torvald, how long is it? 8,000 years?

1613
01:48:43,557 --> 01:48:45,174
差不多
{\fs12}Well, something like that.

1614
01:48:45,229 --> 01:48:48,104
直到地表环境稳定
{\fs12}Just until the surface environment stabilizes.

1615
01:48:51,414 --> 01:48:54,078
我们在这里做的 并不是史无前例的
{\fs12}It's not unprecedented what we are doing here.

1616
01:48:54,515 --> 01:48:56,804
不到10万年前
{\fs12}Less than a hundred thousand years ago

1617
01:48:56,929 --> 01:48:59,429
人类经历了近乎灭绝的境地
{\fs12}humans underwent a near-extinction.

1618
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:01,773
也许只有2000人生还了
{\fs12}Maybe 2,000 survived.

1619
01:49:01,914 --> 01:49:03,359
来自于一小撮
{\fs12}And from that handful

1620
01:49:03,391 --> 01:49:05,748
而你今天看到 有数十亿的人类
{\fs12}came all of the billions of people you see today.

1621
01:49:05,813 --> 01:49:08,133
重启物种 并不新鲜
{\fs12}Rebooting the species. It's nothing new.

1622
01:49:08,173 --> 01:49:09,641
没错
{\fs12}Yeah, exactly.

1623
01:49:17,782 --> 01:49:19,001
朋友们
{\fs12}My friends.

1624
01:49:19,798 --> 01:49:21,196
许多年前
{\fs12}Many years ago,

1625
01:49:21,322 --> 01:49:24,463
当我们发现细胞微型化时
{\fs12}when we discovered cellular miniaturization,

1626
01:49:24,628 --> 01:49:27,355
世界似乎注定
{\fs12}the world which had seemed so doomed

1627
01:49:27,452 --> 01:49:30,178
会突然充满了可能性
{\fs12}felt suddenly so full of possibilities.

1628
01:49:31,163 --> 01:49:35,326
所以 直到最近 我仍然希望
{\fs12}So, until very recently, I maintained hope

1629
01:49:35,444 --> 01:49:38,298
我们明天开始的应急计划
{\fs12}that the contingency plan we embark upon tomorrow

1630
01:49:38,346 --> 01:49:40,745
应保持简单
{\fs12}could remain simply that--

1631
01:49:41,135 --> 01:49:42,596
完全按计划
{\fs12}a plan.

1632
01:49:44,206 --> 01:49:45,335
但
{\fs12}But...

1633
01:49:45,916 --> 01:49:47,594
历史已经说过了
{\fs12}history has spoken.

1634
01:49:48,455 --> 01:49:52,697
这是我们最后的晚餐 在我们称之为家的地方
{\fs12}And this is our final dinner in the place we've called home

1635
01:49:52,776 --> 01:49:54,612
这么多年了
{\fs12}for so many years.

1636
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:58,380
是的 我们很难离开
{\fs12}Yes, we are sad to leave,

1637
01:49:59,566 --> 01:50:03,551
更非常可悲的 是背后的原因
{\fs12}and terribly sad for the reasons why.

1638
01:50:04,863 --> 01:50:08,504
但是人类太美了
{\fs12}But man is too beautiful,

1639
01:50:09,657 --> 01:50:12,506
这种生命形式
{\fs12}too improbable a life form

1640
01:50:12,531 --> 01:50:16,274
应不被允许从宇宙中永远消失
{\fs12}to be allowed to disappear forever from the cosmos.

1641
01:50:19,005 --> 01:50:20,263
现在
{\fs12}Now then,

1642
01:50:21,677 --> 01:50:24,833
我想请幸存的
{\fs12}I would like to ask the surviving members of the

1643
01:50:24,889 --> 01:50:27,264
原始殖民地成员起立
{\fs12}original colony to stand.

1644
01:50:39,214 --> 01:50:41,449
看看他
{\fs12}Ah, look at him.

1645
01:50:41,565 --> 01:50:43,206
小罗尼
{\fs12}Little Ronni.

1646
01:50:43,339 --> 01:50:45,582
他是如何成长的
{\fs12}How he has grown.

1647
01:50:50,373 --> 01:50:52,342
我再问一次
{\fs12}I ask you again

1648
01:50:52,475 --> 01:50:55,100
就像我多年前问你的那样
{\fs12}as I asked you so many years ago.

1649
01:50:56,144 --> 01:50:57,996
下一代的来临
{\fs12}Generations to come,

1650
01:50:58,176 --> 01:51:00,644
也许全人类都会感谢你
{\fs12}perhaps all of humanity will thank you

1651
01:51:00,669 --> 01:51:02,887
为你的勇敢和承诺
{\fs12}for your bravery and commitment.

1652
01:51:03,399 --> 01:51:04,836
但你必须扪心自问
{\fs12}But you must ask yourself

1653
01:51:04,861 --> 01:51:07,735
是否真的准备好进入新世界了
{\fs12}whether you are truly ready to enter a new world.

1654
01:51:08,016 --> 01:51:10,438
因为不会有回头路了
{\fs12}For there will be no turning back.

1655
01:51:12,548 --> 01:51:14,282
准备好了吗
{\fs12}Are you ready?

1656
01:51:15,367 --> 01:51:16,577
我准备好了
{\fs12}I am ready!

1657
01:51:16,937 --> 01:51:18,031
我准备好了
{\fs12}I am ready!

1658
01:51:18,296 --> 01:51:19,363
我准备好了 是的
{\fs12}I am ready! -Yes!

1659
01:51:19,886 --> 01:51:20,769
我准备好了
{\fs12}I am ready!

1660
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,668
大家都准备好了吗
{\fs12}Is everyone ready?

1661
01:51:28,616 --> 01:51:29,843
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We are ready!

1662
01:51:30,155 --> 01:51:31,344
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We are ready!

1663
01:51:31,803 --> 01:51:33,021
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We are ready!

1664
01:51:33,421 --> 01:51:34,616
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We are ready!

1665
01:51:35,226 --> 01:51:36,257
我们准备好了
{\fs12}We are ready!

1666
01:51:36,858 --> 01:51:37,944
我们准备好了

1723
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,629
如果你没有失去腿
{\fs12}And-And had you not lost your leg,

1724
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:20,730

{\fs12}I wouldn't have tried to help you, which, as usual,

1725
01:54:20,755 --> 01:54:21,848
我搞砸了

1729
01:54:29,945 --> 01:54:33,651
我终于有机会 做一些重要的事情
{\fs12}I finally have a chance to do something that matters.

{\fs12}Oh, Paul, come on, now you're talking crazy.

1731
01:54:35,964 --> 01:54:38,410
这些人很棒 但是
{\fs12}These people, they're wonderful, but--

1732
01:54:38,628 --> 01:54:39,769
就像是邪教
{\fs12}It's like a cult.

{\fs12}Besides, you think they won't behave like people always behave?

1737
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:52,333
他们会在那里发疯 然后自相残杀
{\fs12}They're all gonna go insane down there and kill each other.

1738
01:54:52,473 --> 01:54:54,426
他们会在我们之前就灭绝的
{\fs12}They'll go extinct long before we do.

1739
01:55:05,310 --> 01:55:08,067
别担心 亲爱的 他自己说的
{\fs12}Don't worry, darling. He said it himself.

1740
01:55:08,092 --> 01:55:10,146
他从来没有想过 要做什么事
{\fs12}Nothing he ever wants to do works out.

1741
01:55:47,749 --> 01:55:49,577
今天天气真好啊
{\fs12}It's a beautiful day, huh?
