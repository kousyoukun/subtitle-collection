-How about a rocket ship?
-[both laugh]

640

Well, maybe not a rocket ship.
My mama don't like me to fly.

641
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:23,203
But me, I've always

You just have to put on
one of these tails here,

789

I can't move in one of these.

And that is the point.

793

Mr. Allen agreed only as long

794
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,342
as there is no wiggling
of those hips.

795
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,078
I can't figure it out. My own
mother approves of what I do.

796
00:40:12,145 --> 00:40:13,680
Mmm.

797
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,549
You have read the papers,
my boy?

798
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,184
Yeah, I read the papers.

799
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,553
The papers say that I shot
my mother and smoke marijuana.

800
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,623
Your movement's
in the style of a Black man,

801
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,192
and you have broken
the segregation laws.

802
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,294
So let's follow the plan.
It's a good plan.

You do the <i>Allen Show,</i>

And we put this whole
unfortunate misstep behind us.

807
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,742
Now, do you want
to go into politics?

808

Is this the best we can do,
Admiral?

1379
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:20,879
Well, we took
the Hollywood phonies

01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:22,348
for every nickel they had

1381
01:11:22,415 --> 01:11:24,850
and now it is time
for us to pack up our tents

1382
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:26,885
and move on
to even greener pastures.

1383
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:28,621
We've seen "Elvis the Rebel,"

we've seen
"Elvis the Movie Star."

"Elvis the Family Entertainer."

What did you say?

1388
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:42,302
Listen, Jerry,
I don't need you to question me

1389
01:11:42,368 --> 01:11:45,672
about how I support my family
and every goddamn person here.

You understand me?

1391

If you don't like it,
you can go back to Memphis.

to put me in jail,

'cause of the way I was moving.

So they cut my hair,

they put me in uniform
and they sent me away.

That killed my mother.

[Parker] Hit me. Hit me.

1823
01:34:59,799 --> 01:35:04,337
Mr. Parker, Mr. Kohn
would like to see you.

1824
01:35:04,403 --> 01:35:06,872
Colonel Parker. Hit me.

1825

with new people.

1828

You've lost your meal ticket.

1829

to make things...

1831
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:30,663
Uncomfortable.

1832
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:33,899
Well, before the army, we found
no record of you at all.

1833
01:35:33,967 --> 01:35:36,569
No passport, no residency.

1834
01:35:36,636 --> 01:35:39,538
You were never a colonel.
Never a Tom.

1835
01:35:39,605 --> 01:35:41,440
You weren't even a Parker.

1836

-[brushing teeth]
-[Priscilla] I don't know why

the lawyers take care of it.

1839
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:56,023
[Elvis] I have to see him
in Vegas.

1840
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:58,491
He's in the hospital.
It's the right thing to do.

-[chatter on TV]

1844
01:36:03,262 --> 01:36:05,065
You know what he's like.
The second that
you're near him,

1845
01:36:05,132 --> 01:36:07,600
you'll be under ten feet
of snow before you know
what's happened.

1846
01:36:07,667 --> 01:36:10,904
[spits] My mind's made up.
Business is business.

1847
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:12,271
He and I are done.

1848
01:36:12,338 --> 01:36:14,041
But I owe it to him
to tell him to his face.

1849
01:36:14,107 --> 01:36:17,843
Well, just make sure he
doesn't clip your wings, honey.

1850
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:19,512
[spits] He won't!

1851
01:36:19,578 --> 01:36:22,115
I am gonna go
see him in Vegas.

1852
01:36:22,181 --> 01:36:26,886
I'm gonna look him in the eyes,
and I'm gonna tell him...

-[Priscilla] Watch my hair.

Oh. My boy.

Oh, my boy, I should have

Heart attack?
Colonel, you said your back--

My heart just stopped is all,
and I fell. It's--

01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:28,881
I put my back out.

[Diskin] There you go.

1879
01:37:32,785 --> 01:37:35,621
It was all the excitement about
the Christmas special, you see.

1880
01:37:35,688 --> 01:37:36,990
I should never have worried,

1881
01:37:37,057 --> 01:37:40,860
because you came through
like you always do.

1882
01:37:40,927 --> 01:37:45,464
Nobody can sell "show"
to an audience like you.

1883
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:47,934
I admit it. I was wrong.

1884
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:51,370
Colonel, I--

1885
01:37:52,338 --> 01:37:54,340
I wanted to tell you in person.

Um...

1887
01:37:57,276 --> 01:38:00,546
As far as business
is concerned...

1888
01:38:00,613 --> 01:38:02,983
I think we need to go
our separate ways.

1889
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,987
[slot machines

1890
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:09,923
Well, you may be right.

1891
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:12,658
Maybe it is time for me
to retire.

1892
01:38:12,725 --> 01:38:14,894
Oh, come on, Colonel,
quit snowin' me.

1893
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:16,328
You ain't retiring.

1894
01:38:16,395 --> 01:38:20,533
I will miss the circus. I will.

1895
01:38:20,599 --> 01:38:23,036
But I cannot keep up
with these young fellas,

1896
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:24,603
like your Mr. Hulett,

1897
01:38:24,670 --> 01:38:27,540
who wants to put together
a new show

1898
01:38:27,606 --> 01:38:30,309
for an international tour,

1899
01:38:30,376 --> 01:38:32,745
for you to play stadiums.

1900
01:38:32,812 --> 01:38:38,118
These international tours
are very, very expensive.

1901
01:38:38,185 --> 01:38:41,787
And the costs
cut into the artist's profits.

1902
01:38:41,854 --> 01:38:43,856
I worry that the financial risk

1903
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:46,993
would put a strain
on your daddy.

1904
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,561
But I cannot help but think,

1905
01:38:48,627 --> 01:38:50,563
as your former
technical advisor

1906
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:53,732
and as an old friend,
what if...

1907
01:38:53,799 --> 01:38:58,771
the next Elvis Presley show
did not cost you a red cent?

1908
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:06,779
I wonder if your daddy would
not like the sound of that.

1909
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:11,617
The brand-new
International Hotel.

1910
01:39:30,937 --> 01:39:33,672
[whistles]
It's a mighty big stage.

1911
01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:35,741
The biggest in Las Vegas.

1912
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,911
You could get lost
in a place like this.

1913
01:39:37,978 --> 01:39:40,813
My boy, you performed
that comeback special

1914
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,984
on a tiny square,
inside a studio,

1915
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:45,618
and the fans loved it.

1916
01:39:45,684 --> 01:39:47,120
In a room this size,

1917
01:39:47,187 --> 01:39:51,891
you could give them
the greatest show on earth.

1918
01:39:51,958 --> 01:39:55,694
Nothing less
than Elvis Presley.

1919
01:39:55,761 --> 01:39:58,932
I've been experimenting
with a new, big sound.

1920
01:39:58,999 --> 01:40:00,066
Good. Good, my boy.

1921
01:40:00,133 --> 01:40:02,202
Because you can fill up
this entire stage

1922
01:40:02,269 --> 01:40:05,171
with every musical idea
that is inside that head.

1923
01:40:06,339 --> 01:40:07,673
No, it would cost.

1924
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:10,076
[laughing]
Yes, that's the beauty of it.

1925
01:40:10,143 --> 01:40:12,012

[Elvis] Mmm-hmm.

1929
01:40:21,254 --> 01:40:23,856
...needs a major drawing card

1930
01:40:23,924 --> 01:40:27,726
to pull in all the rubes
and put it on the map.

1931
01:40:27,793 --> 01:40:30,596
So they will cover
all of the costs

1932

of putting together your show.

1933
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:34,533
And you just play here
for six weeks,

1934
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:36,468
and then off you go,

1935
01:40:36,535 --> 01:40:39,139
to tour around the world

1936
01:40:39,205 --> 01:40:43,310
with no financial risk
to Elvis Presley Enterprises.

1937
01:40:43,376 --> 01:40:44,777
None.
