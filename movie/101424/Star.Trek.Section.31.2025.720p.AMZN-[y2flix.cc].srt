166
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,991
You're heading up a team

Deltan sexy time charm.

standing in the back,
looking like he has thoughts.

Being authorized to arrest me

isn't the same

324
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,234
For example, I could be
intimidated by you right now.

325
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,270
I mean, after all,
you've murdered

326
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,804
so many people...
(chuckles nervously)

327
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,974
and you seem to be staring
right into my soul.

328
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,042
(exhales)

329
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,644
I could respond to that

330
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,079
or I could observe my feelings
right now,

331
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,681
lock it away
and do what I need to do.

332
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,485
- Or...
- Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

333
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:00,219
- QUASI: Yes.
- MELLE: Sometimes Quasi sees

334
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,155
- so many options
he gets brain-freeze.
- Thank you, Melle.

335
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,225
- Quasi, can we carry on, please?
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,261
Our target's name is Dada Noe.

337
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,996
Dubious moral compass.

338
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,733
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt
Colonies before he went rogue.

339
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,236
Since then, he's been
designing bioweapons on spec.

340
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,939
Noe's on his way to the <i>Baraam</i>
to sell his latest creation

341
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,608
to the Minosian High Council.

342
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,611
There are no formal hostilities
with the Minosian Sway,

343
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,413
but that could change
if they get their hands

344
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,880
on a superweapon.

345
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,749
GEORGIOU:
Do we know what
this bio superweapon is?

346
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,851
GARRETT:
No, but if Dada Noe is
selling it, it's bad.

347
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:35,455
So you're here to make sure
the sale never happens.

348
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,824
How?

349
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:40,292
Things went south
when you spotted us,

350
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,496
but the plan is still solid.

351
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,766
First, Alok was going to...

352
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,635
You can say it.

353
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:50,970
Connect.

354
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,105
- With you.
- (laughs)

355
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:56,008
- Welcome! Mmm.
- Yes.

356
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,677
(Georgiou squeals)

357
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,813
What a cute idea.

358
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,215
Once we had you
suitably distracted,

359
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,285
Quasi would do
the other thing Quasi does.

360
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,455
ALOK:
Okay, Quasi.

361
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,257
- If you would do the honors.
- Absolutely.

362
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,299
Let's get to work.

363
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,340
Welcome, Dada Noe.

364
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,577
ALOK:
This is where Fuzz comes in.

365

<i>FUZZ:

<i>For example, the inner workings
of body modifications.</i>

369
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,725
Oh, once I fly inside
Dada's body mod,

370
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,860
well, then it's time
to get to work.

371
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,196
So many circuits.

372
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,931
So many things
that could go wrong.

373
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,833
Competency crusader here
will talk me through

374
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,301
the tech on the implant.

375
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,471
And if I think we're putting
Dada Noe's life in danger

376
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,872
by tinkering with that implant,

377
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,408
I will unleash
the full weight of Starfleet

378
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,076
on this whole operation.

379
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,312
Oy, we're talking about a bloke
who's selling superweapons

380
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,313
to any third-rate terrorist
with a Latinum card.

381
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,149
GARRETT:
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

382
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:13,085
Starfleet does not do
assassinations.

383
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,755
Ay, don't get your
prime directives in a bunch.

384
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,124
You are not going to get
your hands dirty

385
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,259
and mess up your chances
of becoming captain.

386
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,794
I'm a top-tier science officer.

387
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,863

- (coughs): Tight-ass.

388

- So disrespectful.

389
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,867

sever that link...

390

Dada Noe and his pathogen
will be in custody

show up to the <i>Baraam.</i>

Speak.

It is for you, Majesty.

It is all...

528

00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,645
Before all this.

537
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:09,580
The curious boy.

538
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,351
The innocent girl.

539
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,587
I only remember
my failure, Majesty.

540
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,657
Don't lie to me.

541
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,429
We were the only ones
who could understand

542
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,931
the cost to stay alive.

543
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,668
We made a team.

544
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:33,172
We needed each other, didn't we?

545
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:37,108
What did we say
to carry each other through,

546
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,310
to survive together?

547
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,147
We are two...

548
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,813
(San's breath trembling)

549
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,550
SAN:
But one.

550
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,186
BOTH:
We are two but one.

551
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,355
If I said then,

552
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,856
"Let's run away,

553
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,391
"let's flee this competition

554
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,660
and everything
that binds us to Terra,"

555
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,029
what would you have said?

556
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,531
Hmm?

557
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,404
The timing of your question
is more poetic than you know.

558
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,776
I would have said yes.

559
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,050
Then.

560
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,821
But now?

561
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:29,228
You could have made something
beautiful with your reign.

562
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,963
Instead, you chose
to build this.

563
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,999
That means
that innocent girl I knew,

564
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,569
she has been...

565
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,471
(choking):
...murdered.

566
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,173
(retching loudly)

567
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:42,608

568
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,543

- (ragged breathing)

569
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,380
You took the same poison?

570
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:52,551
No! I forbid you to die!

571
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,587

572

580
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,301
Why aren't you
torturing answers out of me?

581
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,635
You're a tyrant.

582
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,003
A real one.

583
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,505
Torture wouldn't work.

584
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,940

about people like me?

585
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,442
Hmm?

586
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,647
You learned tyranny somewhere,
and you learned hard.

587
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:59,017
If you have to hide it,
that's a weakness.

588
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:04,088
And I can't have that
in a partner.

589
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,325
- We're not partners.
- No?

590
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,226
I've been very helpful.

591
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,028
You had a plan
that couldn't work.

592
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,330
I gave you a better one.

593
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,799
You gave me
a taste of the action,

594
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,701
knowing I'd want more.

595
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,837
You need me.

596
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,206
You chose me.

597
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,276
Why?

598
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,545
Whatever you believed
your mission was,

599
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,614
it's worse than you thought.

600
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:33,084
Billions of lives are at stake,
and time is short.

601
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,088
Tell me you,
and I will tell you me.

602
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,491
The only way this works
is if I know

603
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,795
exactly who I'm dealing with.

604
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,609
I'm not from this time, either.

605
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,079
I was born on Earth,
20th century.

606
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:04,650
You are 350 years old?

607
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,051
More or less.

608
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,587
I slept most of that time.

609
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,557
After my exile.

610
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,562
The Eugenics Wars.

611
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:22,734
Augments...

612
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,470
took my planet.

613
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,773
My home.

614
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,147
There was maybe ten of us
who fought.

615
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:39,718
Everyone I knew
either took a bullet or a blade.

616
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,953
But I gave some back.

617
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,457
She noticed me.

618
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,860
The Augment
who slaughtered my family.

619
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:54,933
They called her Giri the Marked.

620
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,901
She took me in.

621
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,105
Made me stronger than
any human should be.

622
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:01,640
She ripped me apart

623
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,242
and turned me into
another Augment for her army.

624
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,346
And I did terrible things.

625
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:12,751
All for a monster like you.

626
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,124
Because for tyrants,
there is only one choice:

627
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,560
murder.

628
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,163
You haven't killed me.

629
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,633
Yet.

630
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:38,710
I recognized the weapon because
I ordered it to be built.

631
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,481
Gather your people.

632
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,150
We're gonna need
every one of them.

- Yeah, I'm still not getting it.
- The Godsend is...

653
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,836
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

654
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,772
- It's Godsend. No apostrophe.
- Send.

655
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,440
The Godsend is here.

656
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,743
How? It's from another universe.

657
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,510
I don't know,
but that man had it.

658
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,312
The one that you think
is Dada Noe.

659
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,248
The one we know is Dada Noe.

660
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,383
No, he's not your Dada Noe.
He can't be.

661
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:29,353
He's from the Terran Empire,
and he brought the Godsend here.

662
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:32,658
That's the only way
he can know about it.

663
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,159
And since we have him
locked up tight,

664
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,961
- I'll interrogate him.
- GARRETT: No, no, no.

665
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,362
- We cannot trust
a single word this woman says.
- Yeah.

666
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:39,865
She cost us Melle.

667
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,800
She's the only one who knows
what we're dealing with.

668
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,769
Yeah, well, so she says,
little bro.

669
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,203
- Little?
- (sighs)

670
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,905
Scale-shamer!

671
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,640
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

672
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,308
Calm your boots.
What I'm saying is...

673
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,711
I will piss in your suit
until you go all rusty like!

674
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,380
...that she's the reason
this is all bollixed up.

675
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,348
She's the reason Melle's dead,
and she's the reason

676
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,650
we're in the ass end
of the galaxy.

677
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,018
ALOK:
Listen up.

678
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,790
Georgiou and I are
gonna go back to the ship.

679
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,225
Dada Noe is our only link
to the Godsend,

680
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,329
<i>so we're gonna have
a little chat with him.</i>

681
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,010
What?

682
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,077
ALOK:
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

683
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,847
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

684
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,748
Mother of the Fatherland.

685
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,050
Overlord of Vulcan.

686
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,519
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

687
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,088
Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

688
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,190
DADA NOE:
Cool.

689
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,491
That come with fries?

690
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:42,927
(laughing):
That was good, right?

691
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,294
(grunts)

692
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,164
(groans) Okay.

693
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,133
ALOK:
Every time you don't answer
her questions directly,

694
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:52,270
Her Majesty will punch you
in your face.

695
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,239
(sighs):
Fine.

696
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,141
I'm Dada.

697
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,308
Dada Noe. Just Dada, then Noe.

698
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,711
That's it. No in-betweens.

699
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,112
And I, uh...

700
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:06,517
I used to run a pathology lab
in the Watt Colonies.

701
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,289
(grunts, groans)

702
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,791
What the shit, man?!

703
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,895
You said that she was gonna be
doing the face punching!

704
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:20,431
So now we both have lied.
You are not that Dada.

705
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,867
(sighs)

706
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:24,235
You're what these people call
his Mirror.

707
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,039
You came here
from the Terran Empire,

708
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,474
and you brought the Godsend.

709
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,210
What's the Godsend?

710
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,511
(Georgiou exhales sharply)

711
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,947
My own war council
tried to depose me.

712
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:39,250
Do you know how I convinced
the field marshal to talk?

713
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,186
Hmm?

714
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,488
(whispering indistinctly)

715
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:47,993
(grunts nervously)

716
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,327
I was an administrator

717
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,229
at an Imperial weapons facility
on Terra.

718
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,597
Uh, yeah.

719
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:56,234
The Godsend was stored
at my facility.

720
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,038
Most thought it was a legend,
but I knew it was real.

721
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:02,741
So you tried to sell it.

722
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,174
DADA NOE:
Yeah, yeah.

723
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:07,779
I wanted to live here quietly
on its proceeds.

724
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,580
ALOK:
How did you get to our universe?

725
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,016
Hmm?

726
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15,553
There was an ion storm.

727
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,588
Two of them, actually.

728
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,125
And when they converged,
which they do like clockwork,

729
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,393
they ripped something open
on the fringes of the Empire--

730
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:28,099
an anomaly, they called it--
but it was a passageway

731
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,136
to get to this place
from the Terran Empire.

732
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,370
(laughing)

733
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,307
Comes out through
your Crescent Nebula.

734
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,609
Few know about it. For now.

735
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,479
But it'll open again
in four hours.

736
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:44,149
That's when I was supposed to be
meeting my buyer.

737
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,084
Are you aware of
what that weapon does?

738
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,619
The Terran Empire's burned
through its resources.

739
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,855
There's famine.

740
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:52,523
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

741
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,925
They need to find
a new territory

742
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,661
to conquer and strip-mine.

743
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:59,229
When they realize that
their superweapon is gone,

744
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,966
they're gonna find
that passageway--

745
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,667
you know they will--
and they'll come

746
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:06,304
and they'll burn everything
they touch and enslave the rest,

747
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:09,507
because that's
what the Empire does, Majesty.

748
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,178
(chuckles):
They learned well from you.

749
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,745
(Dada Noe laughing)

750
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,446
- (screams)
- ALOK: Who else wants it?

751
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,549
DADA NOE:
I-I don't know, man.

752
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,919
I got an offer.
The money was real.

753
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,154
Someone stole the Godsend
from us.

754
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:25,255
- Who was he?
- DADA NOE: No idea.

755
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,626
Whoever broke into my room,
whoever stole that weapon,

756
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,495
they know what they know
because they learned it

757
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,163
from one of you.

758
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,865
(Dada Noe groans)

759
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:39,603
(explosion)

760
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,673
(yelling, groaning)

761
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:54,452
ALOK (echoing):
Emergency transporter.

762
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,721
(explosions)

763
00:46:18,643 --> 00:46:22,881
(Dada Noe screaming, whimpering)

764
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:30,221
Well, this is great.

765
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,590
Oh, even better.

766
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,960
ZEPH:
Is that... is that the ship?
Is the ship gone?

767
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,261
I liked that ship.

768
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,096
What happened?

769
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,931
Sabotage.

770
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,534
What?

771
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,105
GEORGIOU:
Whoever stole the Godsend
had a partner.

772
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,607
It was someone here.

773
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,979
Which means one of us is a mole.

774
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,447
(gasps)

775
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,752
- Could be you.
- Could be you.

776
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,187
GEORGIOU:
If it were me,

777
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,423
I would have murdered
all of you already.

778
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,893
Look, boss, if there's a mole,
you know it's not me.

779
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:09,894
ZEPH:
(laughs) I mean, that sounds
pretty moley to me.

780
00:47:09,895 --> 00:47:11,462
- I don't know.
- (Quasi stammers)

781
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,231
QUASI:
We've been on
like ten ops together.

782
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,033
Yeah, and I still don't even
know what you look like, do I?

783
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,935
No one knows
what a Chameloid looks like.

784
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,904
- You might change
into anything you want.
- What about Fuzz, huh?

785
00:47:19,905 --> 00:47:21,940
- He exists on a whole other
scale than anybody else.
- Mm, deflecting?

786
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,409
My wife is about to lay
our first litter of egg sacs.

787
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,579
- No, I have 190,000 hatchlings
on the way...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

788
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,247
- ...and I want them to live.
- Well, look,

789
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,748
you could find
a motive for any of us.

790
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,485
Or it could be a combination
of any of you.

791
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,454
You know, like-like Zeph
and-and Fuzz or...

792
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,055
You are spinning out
without Melle.

793
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:39,724
You cannot land on a choice.

794
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,859
Maybe you're putting that in
my head because you're the mole.

795
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,461
Huh? How about Garrett?
She's new.

796
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:44,662
She doesn't care about us.

797
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,197
I'm Starfleet.

798
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:49,900
Whoa. Anyone else feel
that heroic breeze right there

799
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:51,302
ruffling her cape? (laughs)

800
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:53,604
GARRETT:
Okay, there's an old ship
out there,

801
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,940
an old garbage scow.

802
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,641
Yeah, I found it
when you were up there

803
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,242
interrogating metal head.

804
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,744
Must be years
since anyone flew it,

805
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,112
but I think we can work with it

806
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,814
to go after
whoever took the Godsend.

807
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,283
Mm. I dislike you less.

808
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,685

01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:05,893
(sighs)

1604
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:07,462
My better judgment has been

1605
01:31:07,563 --> 01:31:09,031
screaming at me
for two days now.

1606
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:14,401
It keeps saying that you lot
are gonna cost me my job.

1607
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,204
- We might.
- She might.

1608
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,405
CONTROL:
I told my judgment to shut up

1609
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,475
and take a nap.

1610
01:31:21,276 --> 01:31:23,111
'Cause we have work to do.

1611
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:27,683

1612
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:30,753
- Whew.
- QUASI: Wait.

1613
01:31:30,853 --> 01:31:32,655
Did you say Turkana
or say Jur-Jurnana?

1614
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,322
He thought "Your Mama IV."

1615
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,591
(laughs):
Oh, Your Mama IV.

1616
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:39,528
- GEORGIOU: No.
