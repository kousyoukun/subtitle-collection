命運如鑄劍之人 提前鍛造萬物 by- 埃斯庫羅斯

2
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:07,650
人類帝國

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,686
她回來了 她終於回到家了
She's back! She's home!

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,229
菲利帕回家了
Philippa came home!

5
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,107
兩年過去了
YOUNG GEORGIOU: Two years,

6
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:34,153
一切都和記憶中一模一樣
αnd everything looks exactly as I remember.

7
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,158
我以為再也見不到這里了
I never thought I would see this place again.

8
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,539
這一次我們有18個人
There were 18 of us this time.

9
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,377
從帝國各個角落被選中
Culled from every corner of the Empire

10
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,129
帶到地球參加比試
αnd brought to Terra for the contest.

11
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,633
他們說只有一個人能活到最後
We were told that only one of us would survive

12
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,885
熬過這些年
the years to come.

13
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,138
一個孩子…
One child.

14
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,894
…最純粹的帝國血脈
...the purest expression of the Terran identity.

15
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,023
他們讓我們自相殘殺
They pitted us against each other.

16
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,236
一個月又一個月 我們的人數不斷減少
And month by month, our numbers dwindled.

17
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,366
你...你贏了嗎
FATHER: Did...did you win?

18
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,743
結束了嗎
ls it over?

19
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,955
還剩下兩個人
Two of us still live.

20
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,588
桑和我
San and me.

21
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,884
我和桑
Me and San.

22
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,889
我們是二人
BOTH: We are two...

23
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,475
…卻如一人
...but one.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,519
永遠如此
BOTH: Forever.

25
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,232
比試期間”朋友”這個詞是被禁止的
The word "friend" was forbidden during the contest,

26
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,610
但無人時我們會悄悄對彼此說出這個詞
but we whispered it to each other when no one could hear.

27
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
桑和我聯手對抗
San and I combined our skills

28
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,451
總督和其他參賽者
αgainst the proctor and the other contestants.

29
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,120
但只能有一個人成為皇帝
But only one of you could be emperor.

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,541
還剩最後一個任務
One task remains.

31
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,920
誰先完成誰就能統治帝國
The first to complete it rules the Empire,

32
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,756
另一個人余生都將
and the other spends the rest of their life

33
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,924
侍奉新皇帝
in servitude to the new emperor.

34
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,218
你們要做什麼
What do you have to do?

35
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,069
對不起
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,071
你做了什麼
What did you do? !

37
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,076
”不允許與過去有任何牽絆
”No ties to the old life are permitted.

38
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,664
皇帝只能忠於職責
”An emperor can only be loyal to duty.

39
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,919
帝國因此而強大
"Thus does the Empire remain strong.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,379
帝國因此而強盛”
Thus does it grow. "

41
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,552
-媽媽 -菲利帕
Mom. Philippa.

42
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,769
你成功了 而你的對手失敗了
You succeeded where your competitor could not.

43
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
把他帶上來
Bring him here.

44
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,905
桑沒有力量通過最後的考驗
San did not have the strength to pass the final test.

45
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:51,493
此刻他的村莊正在燃燒 昭示著他的懦弱
Even now, his village burns as a testament to his cowardice.

46
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,582
我愛你
: llove you.

47
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,586
你贏了這場較量
TERRAN PROCTOR: You have won the contest.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,089
來領取你的勝利吧
Claim your victory.

49
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,274
桑 上前來
San, step forward.

50
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,820
你如今只為臣服於她而活
You live now only to serve at her heel.

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,378
跪拜吧 向掌控你生命的人
Kneel before the one who owns your life.

52
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,601
我們本為二者…
: We are two...

53
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,145
卻合為一體
But one.

54
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,607
但這一切已經結束了
Not anymore.

55
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,013
向喬治歐陛下致敬
TERRAN PROCTOR: AII hail Philippa Georgiou!

56
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
向帝王致敬
AlI hail the emperor!

57
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,352
致敬 致敬 致敬
CROWD: Hail! Hail! Hail!

58
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,646
致敬
Hail!

59
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,578
這里是指揮部
CONTROL: This is Control

60
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,539
向阿爾法小隊隊長發送優先級消息
with a priority message for Alpha Team Leader.

61
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,960
你的目標是菲利帕·喬治歐
Your subject is Emperor Philippa Georgiou,

62
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,629
特倫帝國的前任統治者
former ruler of the Terran Empire.

63
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,381
她來自一個平行宇宙
lt's in a parallel universe

64
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,800
那里的罪犯數量之多
with the most criminal population

65
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,177
史無前例
in recorded history.

66
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,681
即便在那里 喬治歐的暴行也是最令人發指的
Even there, Georgiou had the market cornered on atrocities.

67
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,312
2257年 她被帶到我們的宇宙
ln 2257, she was brought to our universe

68
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,105
加入了31區
αnd joined Section 31,

69
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,026
但幾年後我們失去了聯系
but after a few years, we lost contact.

70
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,988
最近 喬治歐用假身份出現
Recently, Georgiou was spotted using an alias

71
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,450
在聯邦空間外的邊境地帶
in the border territory outside Federation space,

72
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,537
我們正在那里追蹤黑市上的一個新威脅
where we're tracking a new threat on the black market.

73
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,790
這就是你們小隊的任務
This is where your team comes in.

74
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,752
聯邦條約禁止我們越過那條邊境線
Federation treaty forbids us from crossing over that border,

75
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,297
這意味著星際艦隊不能直接插手
which means Starfleet cannot get its hands dirty.

76
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,842
你和你的31區小隊將潛入 與喬治歐取得聯系
You and your 31 team will go in, make contact with Georgiou

77
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,180
幫助識別並消除這個威脅
to help identify and neutralize the threat.

78
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,974
但要記住…
But make no mistqke...

79
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,978
這條惡犬會咬人 小心你們的後背
this dog bites, so watch your backs.

80
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,482
你們有24小時完成任務
You have 24 hours to complete the mission.

81
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,526
開始行動吧
Get to work.

82
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,455
星際述肌: 31區
ed3000翻譯官 譯

83
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,392
星歷1292. 4

84
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,834
杜弗朗克夫人
VIRGIL: Madame du Franc?

85
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,212
蜜月套房發生了點小意外
Small incident in the honeymoon suite.

86
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,755
恐怕那位新娘在關鍵時刻
I'm afraid the bride molted

87
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,633
蛻皮了
just as things were coming to a climax.

88
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,302
維吉爾 說重點
GEORGIOU: Virgil, get to the point. -

89
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,931
我已派生化危機小組前去 並轉達了您的慰問
I sent a biohazard team and your condolences.

90
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,852
另外 有位客人希望能與您談談
Also, there's a customer hoping for α word with you.

91
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,523
他看起來很清醒 但卻令人著迷
He seems entirely sober but quite intoxicating.

92
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,574
杜弗朗克夫人願意見您
Mqdame Veronique du Franc will see you.

93
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,835
阿洛克·薩哈爾 見過杜弗朗克夫人
Alok Sahar, Madame Veronique du Franc.

94
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,089
杜弗朗克夫人通常需要預約才見客
Madame du Franc normally does business by appointment.

95
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,674
我想預約
I'd like to make an oppointment.

96
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
哦 這位先生想預約呢
Oh, the gentleman would like to make an appointment.

97
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,512
現在 現在 夫人
ALOK: Now. VIRGIL: Now, madame.

98
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,889
不可能 不可能
: lmpossible. : lmpossible.

99
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,354
嗯
GEORGIOU: Mmm.

100
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,277
嗯
Mmm.

101
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,570
再見 維吉爾
Au revoir, Virgil.

102
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,031
嗯哼
Mm- hmm.

103
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,047
這是違法的
ALOK: That is illegal.

104
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,633
而這能賺錢
And that makes money.

105
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,885
這是家正經場所
GEORGIOU: This is a reputable establishment.

106
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,429
我聽說不是
ALOK: Not what I heard.

107
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,806
不如去你辦公室談談 嗯？
- Why don't we discuss it in your office? - Hmm.

108
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,977
我為什麼要帶你去我的辦公室 阿洛克·薩哈爾？
Why would I take you to my office, Alok Sahar?

109
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,939
因為這需要親身體驗
Because it's α hands- on experience.

110
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,750
甜薊花
ALOK: Dulcet thistle.

111
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,669
甜薊花已經滅絕了
Dulcet thistle's extinct.

112
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,421
我有十二公斤這玩意
I've got α dozen keys of this stuff.

113
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,090
要來點嗎？
Have you partaken?

114
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,304
這會是我少有的第一次體驗之一
This would be one of my few first times.

115
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,389
勁很大
Packs a punch.

116
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,309
讓人愉悅的那種
- Ahappy punch. Mmm.

117
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,652
幹杯
Bottoms up.

118
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,404
為金錢 為你
- To money. To you.

119
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,411
嗯
GEORGIOU: Mmm.

120
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,630
現在 別裝了
Now, let's cut the shit.

121
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,634
31區來我的空間站做什麼?
What is Section 31 doing in my space station?

122
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,054
嗯？以為我認不出特工嗎？
Hmm? You think I don't know an agent when I see one?

123
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,014
你帶著六名特工
You're heading up a team of six operatives,

124
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,475
他們都在酒吧里
αnd they're dll over the bar.

125
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
那邊那個變形者
There's the Chameloid,

126
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,232
綠血的變種人
α green- blooded shape- shifter,

127
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,194
正試圖勾引一個德爾塔人
trying to muster sexy time with a Deltan,

128
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,904
一個活生生的誘餌
a walking honey trap

129
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,157
31區顯然在用她轉移注意力
31's obviously using αs a distraction.

130
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,120
但變形者是銀河系唯一
Except Chameloids are the only species in the galaxy

131
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,748
對德爾塔人魅力免疫的種族
immune to Deltan sexy time charm.

132
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,335
還有那邊那個全身高科技裝備的家夥
Then there's the guy with all the high- end mech,

133
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,464
站在後面一副若有所思的樣子
standing in the back, looking like he has thoughts.

134
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,467
機械生命不只是靠蠻力
Mech life, it ain't just about the brute force.

135
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,181
我猜 武器很重 智商很輕
GEORGIOU: I'mgonna say heavy on artillery, low on IQ.

136
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,225
真遺憾
I'm so sorry.

137
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,685
別忘了那個瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

138
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,355
笑得比台上的笑話還誇張
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

139
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,279
瓦肯人從不笑所以他要麼也是個蠢貨
And since Vulcans never laugh, he's either an idiot, too,

140
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,824
要麼是龐法導致精神失常
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

141
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,661
得了吧 這很好笑
Oh, come on. That was funny.

142
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,456
還有你安排的那個一本正經的人類…
GEORGIOU: And the very serious human you stuck him with.

143
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,207
收斂點吧
Reel it in anytime.

144
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,543
她屁股里的棍子插得太深了
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

145
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,545
都從嘴里冒出來了
it's coming out her mouth.

146
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,088
收斂點
Just reel it in.

147
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,093
那是
ALOK: That would be

148
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,180
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett. - Mmm.

149
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,098
星際艦隊
Starfleet.

150
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,769
歡樂的終結者
Where fun goes to die.

151
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,898
你們找到我花了夠久的
It took you long enough to find me.

152
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,026
我們知道你在巴拉姆
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

153
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,320
總有一天會對我們有用
would be valuable to us one day.

154
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,948
我現在可沒什麼動力
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

155
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,910
為別人效力
to anyone but myself.

156
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,924
那麼 我們是不是該開始談條件了？
So, is this where we start negotiating?

157
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,218
嗯 那要看情況
Hmm, that depends.

158
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,386
你知道我多久了
How long have you known about me?

159
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,139
從你接手前任店主開始
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

160
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,849
那人至今下落不明
who we still haven't found.

161
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,184
聽著
Well, all of.

162
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,311
-不是我幹的 -皇帝
That wasn't me. Emperor Georgiou,

163
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,813
我被授權逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

164
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,815
並抹除你的記憶
and wipe your mind clean. -

165
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,275
但我內心有個聲音
But then again, there's a part of me

166
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,694
想讓你繼續帶著這些記憶活著
that wants you to live with your memories.

167
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,280
那些大屠殺的記憶
The genocidal ones.

168
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,117
你有權逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

169
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,372
不代表你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

170
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,124
你真想讓31區 讓我
You really want Section 31 want me- -

171
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,960
一直追著你不放嗎
dogging you until the end of time?

172
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,379
無聊
: Boring.

173
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,715
過去總會追上你
The past always catches up with you.

174
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,884
不管你我是否承認
And as much as both of us

175
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,136
我這是在幫你
might hate it, I'm doing you α favor.

176
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,515
最後一個任務
One lqst mission.

177
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,642
聽著
Listen.

178
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,645
你相信命運嗎
Do you believe in fate?

179
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,355
我相信
Becouse I do.

180
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,691
你逃不過命運
You can't hide from it.

181
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,069
你在這里什麼都不是 喬治歐
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

182
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,200
我給你機會重返戰場
I'm giving you α chance to get back in.

183
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,245
參與銀河系級別的行動
In on the action on a galactic scale.

184
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,706
別再逃避了
Stop running from it.

185
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,085
做回真正的自己
Be who you are.

186
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,383
或者繼續在這當一輩子酒保
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

187
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,514
開始吧
Let's get on with it.

188
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,697
菲利帕·喬治歐 來見見我的團隊
ALOK: Philippα Georgiou, meet my team.

189
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,532
這是梅勒
This is Melle.

190
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,037
澤夫
Zeph.

191
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,289
你像個瑞士軍刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

192
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,208
等等
Uh, hold on.

193
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,877
我不知道那是什麼 但我不會
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

194
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,128
站在這被侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

195
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,588
我說的不是你
I'm not talking about you.

196
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,548
說的是你的戰甲
I'm talking αbout your suit.

197
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,551
你是新來的
ZEPH: Um, you're new,

198
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,595
我就說這一次
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

199
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,473
當你說起戰甲的時候
that when you are talking about the suit,

200
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,974
就是在說澤夫本人
you're talking about Zeph.

201
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,225
-噢 -澤夫患有
- Oh. QUASI: Zeph suffers from

202
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,894
所謂的機甲畸形癥
what we call mecha dysmorphia.

203
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
雖然我不知道那是什麼
ZEPH: And I may not know what that is,

204
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,314
但我也不會接受
but I'm also not gonna take that

205
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,982
你這麼說 誇西 我很生氣
from you, Quas, and personally I'm offended.

206
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,484
-你得知道... -這是事實
- I think you should know...- Well, it's accurate.

207
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,652
這不是診斷結果 你又不是醫生
It's not α diagnosis. You're not α doctor.

208
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,070
澤夫 澤夫 澤夫
ALOK: Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

209
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,404
-他知道 他都知道 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

210
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,447
他知道
He knows.

211
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,782
-他明白 他明白 -是的
He gets it. He gets it. Yes.

212
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,326
那個瓦肯人呢
Okay, what obout that Vulcan?

213
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,787
沒人告訴她嗎
Nobody told her?

214
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,790
這個 你說的這個
This? The thing you're talking to?

215
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,958
瓦肯人只是台機器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

216
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,919
我在里面
I'm inside.

217
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,046
操控著它
Driving.

218
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,140
我從後備載具里控制這具身體
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

219
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,018
用它進入一些狹小空間
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

220
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,187
嗨你好
Hi there.

221
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,231
我是弗茲
I'm Fuzz.

222
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,858
弗茲是納米族
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

223
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,360
很有趣的家夥
Real fun- loving guy.

224
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,736
你好
Hello.

225
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,947
除了他發起瘋來的時候
Except for when he's not.

226
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,699
那時他就失控 有暴力傾向
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

227
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,159
你說第一點就夠了 誇西
Well, you could've stopped αt the first thing, Quasi.

228
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,496
盜版瓦肯載具
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

229
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,250
黑市上一定有不少好東西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

230
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,960
納米族都愛撿破爛
QUASI: Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

231
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,920
31區第一次接觸他們
31 made first contact when

232
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,880
是在一艘廢棄飛船上發現了他們的寄生
we discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

233
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,882
-誇西 -糟了
Quasi. Oh, shit.

234
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,302
再說一遍寄生 誇西
: Say"infestαtion"one more time, Quasi.

235
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,389
說啊 叫我撿破爛的 你這團黑灰
Soy"scavenger, "you sack of amorphous soot!

236
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,182
我...說完我就後悔了
l- ls- - I heard it as soon as I said it.

237
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,559
我要揍你
I will kick your ass

238
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,561
揍到你連個形狀都凝聚不了
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

239
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,479
弗茲 弗茲 冷靜
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

240
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,148
我很冷靜
I am locked down.

241
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:39,404
我被困在這個巨大的機器瓦肯頭里
I'm trapped inside α giant robot Vulcan head.

242
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,824
還有誰比我更冷靜
No one is more locked down than me right now!

243
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,493
納米族的情緒波動很奇怪
Nanokins have o wonky emotional spectrum.

244
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,495
不不不不不不 我不會
No, no, no, no, no, no, Iwillnot

245
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,788
接受你的輕視 梅勒
be condescended to, Melle,

246
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,457
尤其是你 說實話…
particularly not by you, because honest.

247
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,542
我愛你 你太完美了
MELLE: Ilove you. You are everything.

248
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,252
-我這情緒你喜歡嗎 -弗茲
Does my spectrum work for you? - ZEPH: Fuzz.

249
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,755
-就是說 你覺得如何… -弗茲
- Imean, like, like, are you into it or...- Fuzz!

250
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,797
弗茲
Fuzz!

251
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,300
她在羞辱你 夥計
She's insulting you, pal.

252
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,010
我知道德爾塔人就這德行
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

253
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,220
但你也該有點自尊吧
but have a little self- respect, would you?

254
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,513
我們繼續嗎
Can we continue?

255
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,223
這位是瑞秋·加勒特中尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Gorrett.

256
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,684
她只為這次任務臨時加入31區
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

257
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,562
你得罪了誰才來黑ops的 中尉
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

258
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,983
星際艦隊是來確保我們守規矩的
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

259
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,360
星際艦隊是來保衛聯邦
GARRETT: Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

260
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,363
維護和平 防止謀殺發生的
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

261
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,908
-那你呢 -等一下
·And you? - One moment.

262
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,326
誇西進入我的視野
ALOK: Quasi came on my radar

263
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,870
是因為他證實了神經簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

264
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,665
神經簇只是理論上存在
Glioclusters are theoretical.

265
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,292
曾經是理論上存在
Formerly theoretical.

266
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,961
生命就是無數分支的可能性
Life is just branching possibilities.

267
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,130
你知道它們會以你想象不到的方式綻放
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

268
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,258
比如說 我現在可能會被你嚇到
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

269
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,302
畢竟 你殺過
I mean, after all, you've murdered

270
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,804
那麼多人…
so many people.

271
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,973
而你似乎正在洞穿我的靈魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

272
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,643
我可以對此做出回應
I could respond to that

273
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,102
或者我可以觀察當下的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

274
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,688
把它鎖起來 專注於該做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

275
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,483
或者…誇斯 選一個吧
- Or...- Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

276
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,235
好的 有時誇斯會看到
QUASI: Yes. - MELLE: Sometimes Quasi sees

277
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,154
太多選擇而大腦當機 謝謝你 梅勒
so many options he gets brain- freeze. - Thank you, Melle.

278
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,241
誇斯 我們繼續好嗎 嗯
- Quasi, can we carryon, please? - Mm- hmm.

279
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,285
我們的目標是達達·諾伊
Our target's name is Dqda Noe.

280
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,995
道德觀念成問題
Dubious moral compass.

281
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,748
他曾在瓦特殖民地經營一家病理實驗室 後來叛逃了
Ran α pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

282
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,252
從那以後 他一直在按需設計生物武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

283
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,963
諾伊正在前往巴拉姆 準備把他最新的作品
Noe's on his way to the Baraam to sell his latest creation

284
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,631
賣給米諾斯最高議會
to the Minosian High Council.

285
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,634
雖然我們與米諾斯勢力沒有正式敵對
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

286
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,427
但如果他們得到這種
but that could change if they get their hands

287
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,887
超級武器 情況就會改變
on a superweapon.

288
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,764
我們知道這種生物超級武器是什麼嗎
GEORGIOU: Dowe know what this bio superweapon is?

289
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,850
不知道 但既然是達達·諾伊在賣 肯定很糟
GARRETT: No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

290
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,478
所以你們要確保這筆交易不會發生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

291
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,856
怎麼做
How?

292
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,316
雖然你發現我們時計劃出了差錯
Things went south when you spotted us,

293
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,528
但計劃依然可行
but the plan is still solid.

294
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,781
首先 阿洛克要...
First, Alok was going to...

295
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,658
你可以說出來
You can soy it.

296
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,994
搭訕
Connect.

297
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,121
你
With you. -

298
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,999
歡迎光臨 嗯
Welcome! Mmm. Yes.

299
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,837
多可愛的想法
What o cute idea.

300
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,214
趁你被分散注意力時
Once we had you suitably distracted,

301
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,301
誇斯就能做他擅長的另一件事
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

302
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,469
好了 誇斯
ALOK: Okay, Quasi.

303
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,264
請開始吧 當然
- If you would do the honors. Absolutely.

304
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,315
讓我們開工吧
Let's get to work.

305
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,364
歡迎 達達·諾伊
Welcome, Dada Noe.

306
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,575
這就到了弗茲登場的時候
ALOK: This is where Fuzz comes in.

307
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,750
你不會相信我能鉆進多小的地方
FUZZ: You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

308
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,254
比如 體型改造裝置的內部結構
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

309
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,757
一旦我飛進達達的體型改造裝置
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

310
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,884
就該大顯身手了
well, then it's time to get to work.

311
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,219
那麼多電路
So many circuits.

312
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,930
那麼多可能出錯的地方
So many things that could go wrong.

313
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,849
這位能力至上主義者會指導我
Competency crusader here will talk me through

314
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,309
植入物的技術細節
the tech on the implant.

315
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,478
如果我覺得改動那個植入物會
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

316
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,896
危及達達·諾伊的生命
by tinkering with that implant,

317
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,440
我就會讓星際艦隊全面介入
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

318
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,108
這次行動
on this whole operotion.

319
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,319
拜托 我們說的可是個把超級武器賣給
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

320
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,321
任何有拉錫姆卡的三流恐怖分子的家夥
to any third- rate terrorist with a Lotinum card.

321
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,156
聽好了 廢品佬
GARRETT: Listen carefully, Junkyard.

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,117
星際艦隊不做暗殺
Starfleet does not do assassinotions.

323
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,787
得了 別把你的主要指令搞得一團亂
Ay, don't get your prime directives in α bunch.

324
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,122
你不會弄臟自己的手
You are not going to get your hands dirty

325
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,249
破壞自己成為艦長的機會
αnd mess up your chances of becoming captain.

326
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,793
我可是頂尖的科學官
I'm αtop- tier science officer.

327
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,878
蠻橫的家夥 死板鬼
Butt pretzel. - : Tight- ass.

328
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,755
真沒禮貌
So disrespectful.

329
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,882
等加勒特和弗茲切斷那個連接…
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link.

330
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,012
他就會被我們控制 我會在澤夫的幫助下
...he'll be under our control, and I'll take him down

331
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,432
制服他 嗯
with the help of Zeph. - Mm.

332
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,106
這才叫打擊 一個
That's what I callαhit. - One.

333
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,233
在買家到達巴拉姆之前
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

334
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,069
達達·諾伊和他的病原體就會被捕
before the buyers cqn even show up to the Baraam.

335
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,321
我們進去又出來
And we are in nd out.

336
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
嗯 不過…
Mm. Meh.

337
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,326
不過
OTHERS: Meh?

338
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,453
我有個更簡單的主意
I have o simpler idea.

339
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,013
歡迎 諾伊先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

340
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,807
很榮幸您光臨巴拉姆
We're honored to have you here at the Bqraam.

341
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,685
我是維羅妮克·杜弗朗克 這里的主人
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

342
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,687
我說過要準備好我的套房
I told them to have my suite ready.

343
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:23,896
當然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

344
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,232
讓我帶您去房間
May lescort you to your quarters?

345
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,692
來吧
Come.

346
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,029
我們有最精致的…
We have the most exquisite

347
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,613
我不敢相信你會相信這個反社會者
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

348
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,115
好吧 中尉
ALOK: Well, Lieutenant,

349
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,408
你得做該做的事
you got to do what you got to do,

350
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,534
而我對反社會者還挺熟悉的
αnd l'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

351
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,870
我說過不要帶我來
I said don't bring me.

352
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,374
希望您一路順風 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

353
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,669
你們的人確實把一切都安排得很妥當
Well, your people made everything easy.

354
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,297
這是我們的榮幸 到了
Our pleasure. Here we are.

355
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,972
真俗氣
So tacky.

356
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,725
不過這就是你的風格
But I guess that's what you're known for.

357
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,023
這是什麼
What's this?

358
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,399
這叫相位艙
It's called α phase pod.

359
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,027
我的一個客戶送給我的
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

360
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,446
我也給自己弄了一個
αnd I got one for myself, too.

361
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,707
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?

362
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,375
宇宙中的一切都以
Everything in the universe vibrates

363
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
特定的波長振動
- on αcertain wavelength. -

364
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,378
該死
Damn it.

365
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,882
把箱子還給我
Give me back my case.

366
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,383
不
No.

367
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,471
這要從你的安全押金里扣除
That's coming out of your security deposit.

368
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,390
相位艙會改變
The phase pod changes the wavelength

369
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,059
它們接觸物體的波長
of whatever they touch.

370
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,312
我與你相位不同 你也與我相位不同
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

371
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,525
但我與你的箱子相位相同
Iαm, however, in phase with your case.

372
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,238
我要把它帶走
And I will be taking it with me.

373
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:59,117
你不知道你惹上了什麼麻煩
You have no idea what you've started.

374
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,995
糟糕了
Whoopsie.

375
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,877
令人印象深刻
lmpressive.

376
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,462
你確定你是人類嗎
Are you sure you're human?

377
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,589
大多數時候是
Most days.

378
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,258
謝謝
Thank you.

379
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,002
把箱子給我
Give me the case.

380
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,368
你是誰
Who are you?

381
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,298
他往那邊跑了 那邊 那邊 那邊 那邊
He went that way. That way, that woy, that way, that way!

382
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,852
天啊 是外星人
Oh, aliens.

383
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,437
-赤身裸體的外星人 -快追 澤夫
- Nαked αliens. - ALOK: Go, Zeph, go.

384
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,709
他朝休息室去了 天哪 他們跑得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

385
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,461
梅勒 他朝你那邊去了
: Melle, he's coming to you.

386
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,215
天啊
Yikes.

387
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,976
沒事
No, it's okoy.

388
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,560
-我沒事 -梅勒 抓到他了嗎
- l'm all right. - Melle, you got him?

389
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,729
抓到了
Got him.

390
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,899
哇喔
Ooh- la- la!

391
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,609
天啊
Ay, amor.

392
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,366
這不可能
That's not possible.

393
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,909
我明明銷毀了它
I had that destroyed.

394
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,161
不 不
No. No!

395
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,665
這不可能
lt's not possible.

396
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,208
你認識那件武器
ALOK: You knew that weapon.

397
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,252
那是什麼
What is it?

398
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,755
那是什麼
What is it?

399
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,593
好吧 那就來硬的
Fine. The hard way.

400
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,420
永恒祈求者請求覲見
MAN: The Eternal Supplicant begs opproach.

401
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,797
準予覲見
You have my permission.

402
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,599
至高無上的陛下
AlI hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

403
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,933
祖國之母
Mother of the Fatherland,

404
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,102
-火山星的統治者 -什麼事
Overlord of Vulc- What is it?

405
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,105
已經完成了 陛下
lt is finished, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,818
我的工程師們呢
Where are my engineers?

407
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,699
他們…完工後就自盡了
: They...they took their own lives upon completion.

408
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,332
桑 你為誰而哭
Who is the tear for, San?

409
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,294
說
Speak.

410
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,506
為您而哭 陛下
lt is for you, Majesty.

411
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,550
這一切都是…
lt is oll

412
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,346
為了您
for you.

413
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,024
我問你 桑
I αsked you α question, San.

414
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,486
你為何為我哭泣
Why do you cry for me?

415
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,824
看著我
Look ot me.

416
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:03,499
你還記得我們是誰嗎
Do you remember who we were?

417
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,669
在這一切之前
Before oll this.

418
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,588
那個求知若渴的男孩
The curious boy.

419
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,383
那個天真無邪的女孩
The innocent girl.

420
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,594
我只記得我的失敗 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

421
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,681
別對我撒謊
Don't lie to me.

422
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,435
只有我們能理解
We were the only ones who could understand

423
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,939
活下去需要付出的代價
the cost to stay alive.

424
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,692
我們是一個團隊
We made o team.

425
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,195
我們互相需要 不是嗎
We needed each other, didn't we?

426
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,116
為了一起活下去
What did we say to carry each other through,

427
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,326
我們說過什麼
to survive together?

428
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,161
我們是二…
We are two.

429
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,582
為一體
SAN: But one.

430
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,209
我們是二為一體
BOTH: We are two but one.

431
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,378
如果那時我說
If I said then,

432
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,879
”讓我們逃走吧
"Let's run away,

433
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,423
逃離這場競爭
"let's flee this competition

434
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,676
逃離一切束縛我們的地球”
and everything that binds us to Terra, "

435
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,053
你會說什麼
what would you have said?

436
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,555
嗯
Hmm?

437
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,436
您這個問題的時機比您想象的更富詩意
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

438
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,774
那時的我會說好
I would have said yes.

439
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,074
那時
Then.

440
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,828
但現在呢
But now?

441
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:29,251
您本可以締造一個美好的統治
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

442
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,962
但您卻選擇建造這個
lnstead, you chose to build this.

443
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,007
這意味著我認識的那個
That means that innocent girl I knew,

444
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,593
天真無邪的女孩
she hqs been...

445
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,470
已經…死了
: ...murdered.

446
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,640
這是什麼
What is this?

447
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,559
你…
You......

448
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,395
你也服了同樣的毒
You took the same poison?

449
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,566
不 我不允許你死
No! I forbid you to die!

450
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,611
沒有人願意活在
No one wants to live

451
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,156
您的世界里 皇帝陛下
in your world, Emperor.

452
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,326
您是個暴君
You ore a monster!

453
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,940
這又是什麼好地方
GEORGIOU: And what delightful place is this?

454
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,358
安全屋
ALOK: A safe house.

455
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,236
但對你來說可能不太安全
But maybe not so safe for you.

456
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,654
你是31區的人
You are Section 31.

457
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,324
為什麼不用刑逼我說出答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

458
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,659
你是個暴君
You're a tyrant.

459
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,035
真正的暴君
A real one.

460
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,537
刑訊對你沒用
Torture wouldn't work.

461
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,957
你為什麼如此了解像我這樣的人
How do you know so much about people like me?

462
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,458
嗯
Hmm?

463
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,671
你也曾經歷過暴政 而且記憶深刻
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

464
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,049
如果你要隱藏這點 就是軟弱
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

465
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,096
而我的搭檔不能軟弱
And I can't have thot in o partner.

466
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,348
-我們不是搭檔 -不是嗎
- We're not partners. - No?

467
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,225
我幫了很大忙
I've been very helpful.

468
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,060
你的計劃本行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

469
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,353
我給了你更好的方案
I gave you α better one.

470
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,814
讓你嘗到了行動的滋味
You gave me a tqste of the action,

471
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,733
知道你會想要更多
knowing I'd want more.

472
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,861
你需要我
You need me.

473
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,238
你選擇了我
You chose me.

474
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,283
為什麼
Why?

475
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,577
不管你以為你的任務是什麼
Whatever you believed your mission was,

476
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,620
情況比你想象的更糟
it's worse than you thought.

477
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:33,083
數十億人命危在旦夕 時間緊迫
Blllions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

478
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,087
你說你的故事 我就說我的
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

479
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,506
這件事要成功 我必須
The only way this works is if I know

480
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,802
完全了解我在和誰打交道
exactly who I'm dealing with.

481
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,608
我也不是這個時代的人
I'm not from this time, either.

482
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,069
我生於20世紀的地球
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

483
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,656
你有350歲了
You are 350 years old?

484
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,074
差不多吧
More or less.

485
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,619
我沈睡了大部分時間
I slept most of that time.

486
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,580
在我被流放後
After my exile.

487
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,585
優生戰爭時期
The Eugenics Wars.

488
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,758
強化人…
Augments.

489
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,510
奪走了我的星球
took my planet.

490
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,805
我的家園
My home.

491
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,146
當時我們只有十來個人在戰鬥
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

492
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,733
我認識的人要麼中彈要麼被砍死
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

493
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,985
但我也殺了不少敵人
But I gave some back.

494
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,489
她注意到了我
She noticed me.

495
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,868
那個屠殺我家人的改造人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

496
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,957
他們稱她為”有印記的吉里”
They called her Giri the Morked.

497
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,917
她收留了我
She took me in.

498
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,128
讓我變得比常人更強大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

499
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,672
她把我撕碎
She ripped me opart

500
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,259
改造成她軍隊里的另一個改造人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

501
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,345
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

502
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,766
都是為了像你這樣的魔頭
AlI for a monster like you.

503
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:19,147
因為對暴君來說 只有一個選擇
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

504
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,567
殺戮
murder.

505
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,195
你還沒有殺我
You haven't killed me.

506
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,656
暫時沒有
Yet.

507
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:38,709
我認出了那件武器 因為是我下令制造的
I recognized the weapon because I ordered it to be built.

508
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,504
召集你的人
Gather your people.

509
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,173
我們需要所有人手
We're gonna need every one of them.

510
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,546
在我的宇宙里 總有人在密謀
GEORGIOU: In my universe, there were always plotters.

511
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,214
總有政變
Always a coup.

512
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:30,385
所以我打造了一件武器來消滅所有威脅
So I built a weapon to end all threots.

513
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,222
我稱它為天賜
I called it the Godsend.

514
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,934
它會引發連鎖反應
It triggers a chain reaction,

515
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,561
像病毒一樣在行星間傳播
like a virus passing between planets.

516
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,314
所經之處 盡成灰燼
Everything in its poth incinerates.

517
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,900
整個象限都會毀滅
An entire quadrant would be lost.

518
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,277
如果我的敵人設法殺死我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

519
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,447
就再無統治的土地
there would be nothing left to rule.

520
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,242
呃 打擾一下 問個問題
ZEPH: Yeah, hi. Quick question.

521
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,619
抱歉
Sorry.

522
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,579
對 就是 呃 就一個小問題
Yeah, no. Uh, justαqu it's just a quick one.

523
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,249
是天賜還是天譴？
Is it Godsend or God's End?

524
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,293
天賜還是天譴？
Godsend or God's End?

525
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,670
我聽不出你說的有什麼區別
I don't hearα difference in what you're saying.

526
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:08,090
真的嗎？真的嗎？天賜 天譴
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

527
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,384
-我還是聽不出來 -天賜是…
Yeah, I'm still not getting it. - The Godsend is...

528
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,843
等等 天賜 我現在聽出來了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

529
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,804
-是天賜 沒有譴字 -賜
lt's Godsend. No apostrophe. Send.

530
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,472
天賜就在這里
The Godsend is here.

531
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,766
怎麼可能？它來自另一個宇宙
How? lt's from another universe.

532
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,518
我不知道 但那個人有它
I don't know, but that man had it.

533
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,311
就是你認為是達達諾的人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

534
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,271
我們知道他就是達達諾
The one we know is Dada Noe.

535
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,400
不 他不是你們的達達諾 不可能是
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He cqn't be.

536
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,361
他來自帝聯 而且帶來了天賜
He's from the Terran Empire, and he brought the Godsend here.

537
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,656
這是他知道天賜的唯一原因
That's the only way he can know about it.

538
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,157
既然我們已經把他關起來了
And since we have him locked up tight,

539
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,993
-我來審問他 -不 不 不
- I'II interrogate him. GARRETT: No, no, no.

540
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,370
-我們不能相信這個女人說的任何話 -對
We cannot trust a single word this woman says. Yeah.

541
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,871
她害死了梅勒
She cost us Melle.

542
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,832
她是唯一知道我們在對付什麼的人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

543
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,792
是啊 這是她說的 小弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

544
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,210
小？
Little? -

545
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,920
歧視我們小個子！
Scale- shamer!

546
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,672
微生物比恐龍活得久！
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

547
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,340
冷靜點 我是說…
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

548
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,719
我要尿你一身 讓你生銹！
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

549
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,387
...她才是搞砸一切的原因
...that she's the reason this is dll bollixed up.

550
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,347
梅勒死是因為她 我們在銀河系屁股眼
She's the reason Melle's dead, and she's the reason

551
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
也是因為她
we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

552
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,017
都聽著
ALOK: Listen up.

553
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,813
我和喬治歐要回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

554
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,233
達達諾是我們找到天賜的唯一線索
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

555
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,319
所以我們要和他談談
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

556
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,042
怎麼了？
What?

557
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,085
她是菲利帕·喬治歐
ALOK: Her name is Philippα Georgiou,

558
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,879
至高無上的帝國陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

559
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,756
祖國之母
Mother of the Fatherland.

560
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,090
瓦肯的統治者
Overlord of Vulcan.

561
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,509
克林貢的主宰 安多星的女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Reginα Andor,

562
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,096
菲利帕·喬治歐·奧古斯都·雅波尼烏斯·森塔利烏斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus laponius Centarius.

563
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,222
厲害
DADA NOE: Cool.

564
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,515
還送薯條嗎？
That come with fries?

565
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,934
不錯吧？
: That was good, right?

566
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,188
好吧
Okay.

567
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,149
每次你不直接回答她的問題
ALOK: Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

568
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,277
陛下就會打你的臉
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

569
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,237
好吧
: Fine.

570
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,156
我是達達
I'm Doda.

571
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,325
達達諾 就是達達 然後是諾
Dadα Noe. just Dada, then Noe.

572
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,743
就這樣 中間沒別的
That's it. No in- betweens.

573
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,120
然後我...
And l, uh.

574
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,541
我以前在瓦特殖民地管理一個病理實驗室
I used to run α pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

575
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,799
搞什麼鬼啊？！
What the shit, man? !

576
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,927
你說她會打我臉的！
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

577
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,430
現在我們都說謊了 你不是那個達達
So now we both have lied. You are not that Doda.

578
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,267
你是他們所說的鏡像
You're what these people call his Mirror.

579
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,063
你來自帝聯
You came here from the Terran Empire,

580
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,482
帶來了天賜
and you brought the Godsend.

581
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,234
什麼是天賜？
What's the Godsend?

582
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,946
我的戰爭委員會想要廢黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

583
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,282
你知道我是怎麼讓元帥開口的嗎？
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

584
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,201
嗯？
Hmm?

585
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,334
我是帝國武器設施
I was an administrator

586
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,253
的一名行政官員
αt an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

587
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,629
嗯對
Uh, yeah.

588
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,258
天賜就存放在我的設施里
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

589
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,054
大多數人以為它只是個傳說 但我知道它是真的
Most thought it was a legend, but I knew it was real.

590
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,764
所以你想把它賣掉
So you tried to sell it.

591
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,182
對 對
DADA NOE: Yeah, yeah.

592
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,769
我想靠賣它的錢在這里安靜地生活
I wanted to Iive here quietly on its proceeds.

593
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,604
你是怎麼來到我們的宇宙的？
ALOK: How did you get to our universe?

594
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,022
嗯？
Hmm?

595
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,569
有一場離子風暴
There was an ion storm.

596
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,612
實際上是兩場
Two of them, actually.

597
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,157
當它們按規律匯聚時
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

598
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,410
在帝國邊緣撕開了什麼東西－
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire- -

599
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:28,123
他們稱之為異象 但其實是一條通道
αn anomaly, they called it- but it was a passageway

600
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,168
可以從帝聯到達這個地方
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

601
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,339
它通向你們的新月星雲
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

602
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,633
知道的人很少 暫時是這樣
Few know obout it. For now.

603
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,469
但它四小時後會再次打開
But it'll open again in four hours.

604
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,139
那時我本該和買家見面
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

605
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,099
你知道那武器會造成什麼後果嗎？
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

606
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,643
帝聯已經耗盡了資源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

607
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,853
到處都是饑荒
There's famine.

608
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,522
整個生態系統都在崩潰
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

609
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,941
他們需要找到新的領地
They need to find a new territory

610
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,693
來征服和掠奪
to conquer and strip- mine.

611
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,237
當他們發現超級武器不見了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

612
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,989
他們就會找到那條通道
they're gonna find that passageway- -

613
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,699
你知道他們一定會的
you know they will and they'll come

614
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,328
他們會燒毀一切 奴役幸存者
αnd they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

615
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,539
陛下 這就是帝國的作風
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

616
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,210
他們都是跟你學的
: They learned well from you.

617
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,463
還有誰想要它
ALOK: Who else wants it?

618
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,548
我不知道 老兄
DADA NOE: I- I don't know, man.

619
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,926
我收到了報價 錢是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

620
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,178
有人從我們這偷走了天賜武器
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

621
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,263
他是誰 不知道
- Who was he? - DADA NOE: No idea.

622
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,642
不管是誰闖入我的房間 偷走了武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

623
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,518
他們之所以知道這些
they know what they know because they learned it

624
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,187
是從你們中的某個人那學來的
from one of you.

625
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,459
緊急傳送器
ALOK: Emergency transporter.

626
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,245
好吧 這很棒
Well, this is great.

627
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,622
哦 更妙了
Oh, even better.

628
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,000
那是…那是飛船嗎 飛船不見了嗎
ZEPH: Is that...is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

629
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,293
我喜歡那艘船
I liked that ship.

630
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,128
發生什麼事了
What hoppened?

631
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,963
破壞行動
Sabotage.

632
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,551
什麼
What?

633
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,137
偷走天賜武器的人有個幫手
GEORGIOU: Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

634
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,639
就在這里
lt was someone here.

635
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,977
這意味著我們中間有個內鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

636
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,776
可能是你 也可能是你
Could be you. Could be you.

637
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,194
如果是我
GEORGIOU: If it were me,

638
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,447
你們早就都死了
I would have murdered all of you already.

639
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,907
老大 如果有內鬼 你知道不是我
Look, boss, if there's a mole, you know it's not me.

640
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,909
這話聽起來就像內鬼會說的
ZEPH: I meαn, that sounds pretty moley to me.

641
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,494
我不知道
- I don'tknow.

642
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,246
我們一起執行過十次任務了
QUASI: We've been on like ten ops together.

643
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,040
是啊 我連你長什麼樣都不知道
Yeah, andI still don't even know what you look like, do I?

644
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,958
沒人知道變形者的本來面目
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

645
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,919
你可以變成任何樣子 那弗茲呢
- You might change into anything you want. - What about Fuzz, huh?

646
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,963
他和我們完全不是一個量級的 轉移話題了
He exists on α whole other scale than anybody else. - Mm, deflecting?

647
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,425
我老婆快要產下我們的第一窩卵囊了
My wife is about to Iay our first litter of egg sacs.

648
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,595
不 我即將有19萬個幼崽 等等等等
No, Ihave190, 000 hatchlings on the way- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

649
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,263
我希望它們能活下來 聽著
...and I want them to live. Well, look,

650
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,765
你能給我們每個人都找到動機
you could find α motive for any of us.

651
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,517
也可能是我們中任意幾個人聯手
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

652
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,478
比如說澤夫和弗茲或者…
You know, like- like Zeph and- and Fuzz or...

653
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,063
沒有梅勒你就亂了分寸
You are spinning out without Melle.

654
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,731
你無法做出決定
You cannot land on a choice.

655
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,858
也許你說這話是因為你就是內鬼
Maybe you're putting that in my head because you're the mole.

656
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,485
嗯 加勒特怎麼樣 她是新人
Huh? How obout Garrett? She's new.

657
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,694
她根本不在意我們
She doesn't care obout us.

658
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,196
我是星際艦隊的人
I'm Starfleet.

659
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,908
哇 剛才有誰感覺到英雄氣息
Whoa. Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

660
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,326
吹動她的鬥篷了嗎
ruffling her cape?

661
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,620
好吧 那邊有艘舊船
GARRETT: Okαy, there's an old ship out there,

662
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,954
一艘廢棄的運輸船
αn old garbage scow.

663
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,664
是的 當你在上面
Yeah, Ifound it when you were up there

664
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,249
審問鐵頭的時候我發現的
interrogating metal head.

665
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,751
雖然多年沒人駕駛了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

666
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,127
但我覺得我們可以用它
but I think we can work with it

667
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,838
去追那個偷走天賜武器的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

668
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,299
嗯 我對你的厭惡減輕了
Mm. Idislike you less.

669
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,717
啊
Aw.

670
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,344
想讓人喜歡我 我會養條狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get α dog.

671
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,595
我喜歡秩序
I like order.

672
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,056
我喜歡可預測性和結局
I like prediction and conclusion.

673
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,268
那你找錯隊伍了 因為我們這有內鬼
Then you're on the wrong team because we've got mole,

674
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,437
被困在一個死寂的星球上
stranded on a dead planet,

675
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,147
無法與外界聯系
no communication with the outside,

676
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,026
不到四小時泰倫人就能得到天賜武器
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

677
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,028
他們可以在銀河系任何地方使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

678
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,865
說到這個奎斯 天線陣列怎麼樣
Speaking of which, Quas, what about the antenna array?

679
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,035
呃 這個…
Uh, well

680
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,080
它已經過時二十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

681
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,291
我們得讓它運轉起來 然後通知31部門即將發生的事
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

682
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,584
我們一起行動
We work together.

683
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,753
所有人都要保持在視線範圍內 好的
Everyone stoys in sight. - QUASI: Yeah.

684
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,755
就是…
just.

685
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,219
我們走吧
Let's go.

686
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,485
好吧 這個主意泡湯了
QUASI: Well, there goes that idea.

687
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,822
我們的小內鬼真是忙個不停
Our little mole has been really busy.

688
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,532
把所有線路都破壞了
Ripped up all the wiring.

689
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,409
分兩隊 我帶一隊進樹林
Two teams. I'll Iead one into the woods.

690
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,786
三個人去看看能否修好那艘破船
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

691
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,079
你和其他人留在這
You stay here with the others

692
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,664
試著修覆天線陣列
αnd try and fix the antenna array.

693
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,916
她憑什麼現在給我們下命令
Why is she giving us orders now?

694
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,376
因為我允許她這麼做
Because I'm Ietting her

695
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,086
而且我很確定她不是內鬼
αnd l'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

696
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,796
你不會押注在一匹叫”很確定”的馬上
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

697
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,842
奎斯 弗茲 你們馬上和喬治歐去檢查那艘船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

698
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,635
澤夫和加勒特留在這里和我一起
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

699
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,220
我們負責天線陣列
We'll take care of the antenna array.

700
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,139
呃 抱歉
Uh, I'm sorry.

701
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,640
我要和兩個想殺我的人
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

702
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,350
一起去樹林里
with two people who want to kill me?

703
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,686
保持在彼此視線範圍內 別死就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

704
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,104
好嗎
Okay?

705
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,856
好的 謝謝隊長
QUASI: Yep, thanks, Cap.

706
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,900
我是說 只有一半概率其中一個想殺我
I mean, just fifty- fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

707
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,235
然後25%... 奎斯 趕緊滾出去
and then 25‰Quas, just get your ass out there.

708
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,487
我也愛你 隊長
Ilove you, too, Cop.

709
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,447
好了 遵命
ALOK: AII righty. QUASI: Aye, aye.

710
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,959
這艘破船的內部線路
QUASI: The internal circuitry on this old scow

711
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,337
狀況還算不錯
is still in decent shape.

712
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,675
我看到的部件都能用
Everything I'm seeing should work.

713
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,847
所以這個我們在追的東西 天賜武器
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

714
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,975
你們的工程師有沒有裝保險裝置
your engineers, did they install a fail- safe?

715
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,144
我們能遠程禁用它嗎
Can we disable it remotely?

716
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,399
沒有失控保護 我不會允許這種東西
There is no fail- safe. I wouldn't allow it.

717
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,693
這很符合你的風格
How very on- brand for you.

718
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,111
我能再問一個問題嗎
Can I ask you one more question?

719
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,280
我就再問最後一個
I'mjust gonna ask you one more question.

720
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,824
你把神賜帶到這個世界上
So you brought the Godsend into the world

721
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,036
就為了消滅億萬生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

722
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,915
從沒覺得這有點 你懂的 過分嗎
Never thought that was a little, you know, much?

723
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,628
我下令銷毀了它
I ordered it destroyed.

724
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,799
有人藏起來了 你的人背叛了你
And someone hid it. Your own people betrayed you.

725
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,176
你的企業文化爛透了
Well, your corporate culture was straight- up shit.

726
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,387
而且你還沒回答我的問題
And you didn't answer my question.

727
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,889
漸近線線圈不見了
The asymptote coil is gone.

728
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,060
有人一定是為了鋱把它拆走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

729
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,105
找另一個這東西應該能飛
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

730
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,607
-貨艙里可能有 -不行
Mαybe the cargo hull. Huh. Oh, no, no.

731
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,443
所有人要在一起 明白嗎
Everyone stays together, all right?

732
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,280
這樣你就沒機會殺我們了
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

733
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,198
呃…
Uh.

734
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,117
我們去貨艙看看
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

735
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,910
你不來嗎
Aren't you coming?

736
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,913
來 我可太期待了
Yes. Icouldn't be more excited.

737
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,168
我當然可以幫你
ZEPH: Yeah, Icould help you down there, of course,

738
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,546
但是考慮到你知道 控制欲
but considering how, you know, control

739
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,548
是你性格的核心
is central to your entire identity

740
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,550
而我又不擅長這個
αnd the fact that I'm just not good atit,

741
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,094
我就站在這里 尊重我們的關系
I'mjust gonna stand here and honor our relationship

742
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,471
-什麼都不做 -很有幫助
by doing absolutely nothing. ALOK: Helpful.

743
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,181
這叫徹底的自我接納
It's called radical self- acceptance.

744
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,683
-你很開明嘛 -謝謝
Evolved of you. Well, thank you.

745
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,268
你能修好嗎
So, can you fix it?

746
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:49,230
我都不確定它是不是壞了 只是缺了個零件
I'm not even sure it's broken. lt's just missing a part.

747
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,524
你看 這些斷裂的線路看著嚇人
Look, this- this torn wiring Iooks dramatic,

748
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,443
但這設備有備用系統
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

749
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,944
有簡單的替代方案
There's an easy work- around.

750
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,531
但theta接口被人扯掉了
Except somebody ripped out the thetq junction.

751
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,283
除此之外 這東西應該能用
Other than that, this thing should work.

752
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,411
那也許內鬼拿著它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

753
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,460
-加勒特？ -嗯
Gαrrett? - Yeah.

754
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,753
澤夫
Zeph.

755
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,796
澤夫在哪
Where is Zeph?

756
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,306
澤夫 收到請回覆
Zeph, come in.

757
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,434
澤夫 聽到請回話
Zeph, do you copy?

758
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,943
澤夫
Zeph.

759
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,869
加勒特 是你弄的嗎
Garrett, was that you?

760
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,416
加勒特 那是什麼聲音
Garrett, what the hell was that?

761
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,460
有人啟動了天線陣列
GARRETT: Someone just αctivated the antenno array.

762
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,420
該死
Damn it.

763
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,798
發生什麼事了
What's happening?

764
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,300
加勒特 匯報情況
Garrett, sitrep.

765
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,636
這下有好戲看了
FUZZ: This is going to be good.

766
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,597
中尉 收到請回覆 完畢
ALOK: Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

767
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,815
安全
QUASI: Clear.

768
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,401
安全
GEORGIOU: Clear.

769
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,902
這里沒有
FUZZ: Nothing here.

770
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,446
怎麼可能有人用這個發送信號
How could someone have used this to send out α signal?

771
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,657
不可能 它缺了個零件
lmpossible. lt's missing a part.

772
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,034
而且被人打壞了
And someone shot it to hell.

773
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
我聽到有人在跑
GARRETT: I heard someone running.

774
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,038
澤夫一定是把theta接口裝回去了
Zeph must have put the thetq junction back in.

775
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,457
用完天線陣列後又打壞了它
Then shot it after he used the array.

776
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,338
他失蹤後一定是繞回來了
So he must hove circled back after he went AWOL.

777
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:41,676
澤夫來這個星球就是為了破壞我們的行動
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

778
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,553
現在我們被困在這里
And now that we're stranded,

779
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,180
他給他的同夥發了信息
he sent α message to whoever he's working with.

780
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,182
他會躲起來等援軍到了
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

781
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,934
然後就跑得無影無蹤
αnd then he's long gone.

782
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,520
那我們得先找到他
GEORGIOU: Then we need to find him first.

783
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,155
觀察手 收到請回覆
ALOK: Observer, do you copy?

784
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,824
突擊一號 我什麼時候沒收到過
GARRETT: Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

785
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,034
有意思 情況如何
That's funny. Status?

786
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,621
這里幹擾很大
GARRETT: I'm picking up a lot of interference,

787
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,415
但三錄儀顯示澤夫的生命特征
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

788
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,709
剛剛出現在這個區域 完畢
was just in this sector. Over.

789
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,755
收到 保持隱蔽 跟緊點
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

790
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,678
你效忠的軍閥吉里 她怎麼了
The warlord you served, Giri, what happened to her?

791
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,764
她死得跟活著一樣
She died like she lived.

792
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,891
你知道我什麼意思
By that, you know what I mean.

793
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,184
她很幸運
She was lucky.

794
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,269
沒被良心感染
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

795
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,687
-感染？-對
lnfected? - Yeah.

796
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,939
怪物就該是怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

797
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,193
有悔意的怪物毫無用處
A monster with regrets is useless.

798
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,778
所以你才躲在
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

799
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,613
那個鳥不生蛋的酒吧里
in α bar ot the ass end of nowhere.

800
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,032
也許這就是你為什麼要跟31部門合作
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

801
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,784
為了洗清自己
To wipe your slate clean.

802
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,328
像我們這樣的人總要付出代價
ALOK: There's always α price to pay for people like us.

803
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,330
你在這里就說明你也同意
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

804
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,207
原來你是這麼看我的
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

805
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,918
你覺得我是個有感情能被控制的怪物
You think I'm a monster who feels enough to be controlled

806
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,753
但還能幹臟活
but still do the real dirty work.

807
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,172
不我覺得你想要回神賜是因為你知道
No, I think you want the Godsend back because you know

808
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,799
這是你唯一的機會
it's your one chance to redeem yourself

809
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,425
彌補你的罪過
for all the shit you've done.

810
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,261
我要回神賜是因為它是我的
I want the Godsend bock because it's mine.

811
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,772
啊 澤夫的外骨骼在漏水
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is Ieaking.

812
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,655
對越來越多了
Yep, more.

813
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,161
這邊
GEORGIOU: This way.

814

格利普
Grip,

小兒麻痹 流行感冒
Polio, lnfluensina,

817
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,870
-牛痘… -你在說什麼
- Cowpox...- What are you saying?

818
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,789
我在給我的孩子們起名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

819
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,708
既然你們中有人要殺我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

820
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,295
我永遠見不到他們了 但至少我可以一一紀念他們
I'm never gonna meet them, but αt Ieast I can honor them

821
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,671
每一個
one by one.

822

00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,549
崔普2號
Trip 2,

824
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,720
扁桃體炎 克里米亞－剛果出血熱…
Tonsilyitis, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

825
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,555
你要把19萬個名字都哭訴出來嗎
Are you gonna sob out 190, 000 names?

826
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,724
你怎麼能這麼冷血無情
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

827
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,517
他可能記錄下發生的事了嗎
Might he have recorded what happened?

828
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,019
當然有
QUASI: Sure.

829
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,979
但影像可能和他一起消失了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

830
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,024
我們可以把三錄儀連接到他的外骨骼上
ALOK: We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

831
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,610
只要還有數據 就能知道兇手是誰
Whatever data is left, we'll know who did this.

832
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,487
你這是在懷疑我們所有人
QUASI: You say that like we're all suspects.

833
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,156
我們不是 好嗎
We're not. All right?

834
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,701
福茲、我和她當時都在駁船上
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened-

835
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,120
大家都在彼此的視線範圍內
everyone in sight of everyone else.

836
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,414
而且沒人離開過對吧
And nobody went anywhere, right?

837
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,458
-對 -嗯
Right. - GEORGIOU: Hmm.

838
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,631
這不是澤夫的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

839
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:10,551
黑發25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

840
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,234
這太瘋狂了
This is insane.

841
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,778
別亂動
Stop fidgeting.

842
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,404
我和澤夫一起待了一周
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

843
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,114
好吧 你喜歡機械性愛
Okay, so you're into mecha boom- boom.

844
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,241
很多人類都這樣 沒什麼好羞恥的
Lots of humans are. No shame.

845
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,286
嗯
Hmm.

846
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,209
這不可能
Well, that's impossible.

847
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,686
加勒特中尉
ALOK: Lieutenant Garrett,

848
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,647
為什麼你的指甲下有澤夫的血
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

849
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,445
加勒特中尉
GEORGIOU: Lieutenant Garrett,

850
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,323
在澤夫身上發現了你的痕跡
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

851
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,326
在你身上也發現了澤夫的痕跡
αnd evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

852
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,704
一點都不星際艦隊
Not very Starfleet.

853
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,455
我非常星際艦隊
Oh, Iam very Starfleet.

854
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,041
你知道我沒做這事
And you know I didn't do this.

855
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,628
你只是害怕任何有道德準則的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

856
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,921
嗯
Mm.

857
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,842
在那顆純潔的心底
And deep down in that pure little heart,

858
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,928
你其實是個混亂小妖精 對吧
you're αctuallyα chaos goblin, aren't you?

859
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,472
-我知道你有這潛質 天使 -別這麼叫我
- I know you have itin you, angel. - Don't call me that.

860
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,099
星際艦隊看出了你的本質
Starfleet sniffed you out

861
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,977
把你安排在最有用的位置
αnd put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

862
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:47,398
31區正是那些懂得變通規則的軍官該去的地方
Section 31 is just the place for officers who bend the rules,

863
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,651
從不違規 直到他們違規的那一刻
never quite break them until they do.

864
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,488
你在這里很合適
And you fit right in here.

865
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,995
你隨便折磨我
GARRETT: You can torture me all you want.

866
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,706
你永遠不能把我變成殺人兇手
You will never make me o murderer.

867
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,917
不
ALOK: No.

868
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,641
找到錄像了！
QUASI: We've got footage!

869
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,021
住手！
ZEPH: Stop!

870
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,856
住手！
Stop!

871
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,193
這是我的外骨骼
This is my suit.

872
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,528
我就是外骨骼！
I am the suit!

873
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,990
外骨骼就是我！
The suit is me!

874
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,533
等一下
One second.

875
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,665
我們是朋友啊 我們是朋友
We were your friends. We were your friends.

876
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,460
你不能殺我
You can't kill me. -

877
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,670
-澤夫 不要 -你不能殺…
QUASI: Zeph, no. You can't kill...

878
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,220
澤夫是自殺的？
QUASI: Zeph killed himself?

879
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,846
他為什麼要這麼做
Why would he do that?

880
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,268
抱歉讓你失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

881
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,522
這一切都說不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

882
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,940
對 一點都說不通
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

883
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,608
他為什麼要這麼做 呃...
Why would he do this? Uh.

884
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,568
-給我幾分鐘... -我們沒時間了
Give me a couple minutes to......- We don't have minutes.

885
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,904
那給我幾秒鐘
QUASI: Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

886
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,198
呃…
Uh.

887
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,242
-可能是你 -可能是你
Could be you. GEORGIOU: Could be you.

888
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,827
我甚至還不知道你長什麼樣
ZEPH: And I still don't even know what you look like.

889
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,578
你可以變成任何樣子
You could change into anything you want.

890
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,163
她是新來的她不在乎我們
QUASI: She's new. She doesn't care about us.

891
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,873
-我是星際艦隊的 -哇
I'm Starfleet. - Whoa.

892
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,250
說到外骨骼
ZEPH: When you are talking about the suit,

893
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,085
就是在說澤夫
you're talking about Zeph.

894
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,087
這不是福茲
FUZZ: This isn't Fuzz.

895
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,005
瓦肯人只是個機器 你知道的
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

896
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,549
我在里面
I'm inside.

897
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,134
歧視鱗片的人！
Scale- shamer!

898
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,761
你想不到我能鉆進多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

899
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:45,891
比如 身體改造的內部構造
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

900
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,393
有個自動駕駛
There's an autopilot.

901
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,979
這是唯一合理的解釋
That's the only thing that makes sense.

902
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,985
你把瓦肯機器設成了自動駕駛
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

903
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,198
難怪它的反應那麼奇怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

904
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,160
-你不來嗎 -來了
Aren't you coming? - Yes.

905
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,206
你鉆進了澤夫的外骨骼
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

906
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,125
一旦進去之後…
And once you were inside...

907
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,252
有人拆掉了西塔接頭
GARRETT: Somebody ripped out the theta junction.

908
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,212
加勒特 澤夫在哪
Garrett, where's Zeph?

909
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,675
然後你控制了澤夫的外骨骼
GEORGIOU: Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

910
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,887
當其他人出去找他的時候
While the others were out Iooking for him,

911
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,598
你讓他偷偷回到天線陣列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

912
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,058
發送了那些信息
αnd send those messages.

913
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,102
別對他們下手！
Don't do this to them!

914
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,479
我們曾是朋友啊
We were your friends.

915
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:35,107
然後你就毀掉了證據
GEORGIOU: Then you destroyed the evidence.

916
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,650
還殺了澤夫
And you killed Zeph.

917
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,654
然後把證據栽贓給了加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

918
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,493
舉起手來 費茲
Hands up, Fuzz.

919
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,872
真是見了鬼了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

920
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:59,673
你真要相信她說的話嗎 阿洛克？
Whoa. You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

921
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,592
奎斯 想想我們共同經歷的一切
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

922
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,389
我…我能先說一句話嗎？
C- Can Ijust say one thing first?

923
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,271
我還能控制澤夫的機甲
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

924
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,578
快點！
GARRETT: Come on!

925
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,085
”絕不拋棄任何船員”呢？
What happened to"no crew member Ieft behind"?

926
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,546
哦
Oh.

927
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,895
快點 快點！
ALOK: Come on, come on!

928
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,105
靠近點
Get us closer.

929
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,969
我接住你了 我接住你了
QUASI: Igot you. Igot you.

930
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:11,722
該死
Nice and easy. ALOK: Damn.

931
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,574
你一直在關注黑市對吧？
You keep tabs on the black market, hmm?

932
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,493
在那里聽說了上天之眼
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

933
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,869
你在意這個幹什麼？
Why do you care?

934
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,746
你殺了自己的家人
You killed your family.

935
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,540
再多幾十億人又算什麼？
What's a few billion more people, huh?

936
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,418
它在哪里？你在和誰合作？
Where is it? And who are you working with?

937
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,295
你就在他們身邊十步之遙
You took your crown while they died in agony

938
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,423
看著他們痛苦死去時奪取了王冠
not ten feet away.

939
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,385
你把唯一的朋友變成了奴隸
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

940
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,180
最後還厚顏無恥地對他施以仁慈？
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

941
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,268
你怎麼會知道這些？
How could you know that?

942
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:42,062
終於明白了吧
Glad you're catching on.

943
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,022
他騙了你 陛下
He played you, Emperor.

944
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,066
桑還活著
San's alive.

945
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,198
這不可能
lt's not possible.

946
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,785
這怎麼可能？
That's not possible. How?

947
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,455
他一點點服用那種毒藥
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

948
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,749
慢慢建立起了抗體
Teeny tiny doses over time.

949
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:07,379
小人物又贏了一局 陛下
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

950
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,299
他在哪里？！
Where is he? !

951
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,968
他會給你上一場好戲
He's gonna put on quite the show.

952
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,095
你制造了上天之眼
You built the Godsend.

953
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,972
這個怪物是你一手造就
You made this monster.

954
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,224
這都是你的錯
This is all you.

955
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,770
小心點 知道嗎？
Be careful, all right?

956
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,397
我說了小心點
I said be careful.

957
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,483
我還要靠這個活動呢
I have to get around in that.

958
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,364
你現在能買上百個這樣的了
SAN: You can afford α hundred of them now.

959
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,698
哦 太好了
FUZZ: Oh, great.

960
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,867
我只要一個能用的就行
I'd settle for one that works.

961
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,621
所以就是這個？
So that's it?

962
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,248
至高無上的上天之眼
The almighty Godsend.

963
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,624
等你當上皇帝後
When you're emperor,

964
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,337
最好給它換個不那麼讓人困惑的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

965
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,143
一旦通道打開
QUASI: Once that passageway opens up,

966
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,772
他就聯系地球人 他們就會過來
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

967
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,317
他們會在這里引爆它
They're detonating it here.

968
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,195
他就成了帝國的寵兒
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

969
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,073
他會把聯邦搞得一團混亂…
So he throws the Federotion into chaos.

970
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,200
星際艦隊會手忙腳亂
Starfleet will start scrambling.

971
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,994
正是入侵的好時機
Perfect time to invode.

972
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,582
你創造了這個東西
You gave birth to this thing.

973
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,711
我們做不到
- How do we stop it? - GEORGIOU: We don't.

974
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,213
我們被困在這里 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

975
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,549
天線被毀了 警告不了任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

976
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,050
這都是借囗
That is bullshit.

977
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,053
我做不到
You can do better than that. - l can't.

978
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,346
上天之眼就是我
The Godsend is me.

979
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,641
我永遠都戰勝不了自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

980
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:29,396
過去總會追上你
The past always catches up with you.

981
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,772
對吧？
Right?

982
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,779
但不代表它總能贏
ALOK: Doesn't mean it always wins.

983
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,908
每個安全屋我都有後備計劃
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

984
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,535
我們能讓那艘垃圾船啟動
We'll get that scow running.

985
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,872
老大 那垃圾船飛不起來
Boss, the scow won't fly.

986
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,749
沒有漸近線線圈不行
Not without an asymptote coil.

987
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,210
我們有一個
ALOK: We have one.

988
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,129
我們能追上桑
We'll catch up with San.

989
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,548
確保他聯系不上地球人
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

990
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,091
你拆了線圈
GARRETT: You ripped out the coil.

991
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,594
有內鬼在時不能告訴你們
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

992
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,432
混蛋
Asshole.

993
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,489
好了 奎斯 啟動它
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

994
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,663
還是只有一個脈沖
Stil just one pulse.

995
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,461
搞定了
And we're in business.

996
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,589
好了團隊 我們只剩不到30分鐘了
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

997
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,216
奎斯 設定航向新月星雲
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

998
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,427
這會很顛簸 很危險
AII right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

999
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,346
我猜桑的船上有武器吧
I'm assuming Sαn's ship will be armed.

1000
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,182
是啊 地球人的船都有武器
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

1001
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,559
他有質子炮 魚雷
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

1002
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,688
而我們只是艘垃圾船
αnd we are a garbage barge.

1003
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,231
你笑什麼？
Why are you laughing?

1004
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,274
因為情況不會更糟了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

1005
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,407
我們走
QUASI: Let's go.

1006
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,086
這東西在牽引光束中間飛行
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

1007
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,004
人們把垃圾丟進太空
People jettison their garbage into space,

1008
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,923
垃圾船就在牽引光束里飛行
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

1009
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,174
收集這些垃圾
αlong with the field.

1010
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,136
一旦牽引光束裝滿了
Once the tractor field is full,

1011
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,887
就把垃圾倒進星雲
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

1012
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,723
讓輻射把它們分解掉
where it disintegrates in the rodiation.

1013
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,641
我就說明這麼多
I just want to be clear.

1014
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,518
你是說我們最好的武器就是
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1015
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,353
一個收集垃圾的光束？
α beam for collecting garbage?

1016
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,730
-對 -太好了
Yes. Great.

1017
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,566
嘿抱怨可解決不了問題
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1018
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,361
-你去哪？-工程部
Where are you going? - Engineering.

1019
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,904
既然這是我們唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1020
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,906
我要把所有能量都轉到牽引光束上
I'II redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1021
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,033
這主意還不錯
That's actually a good plan.

1022
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,389
我們就位了
FUZZ: We're in position.

1023
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,475
通道馬上就會打開
The passagewoy will open soon.

1024
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,311
你知道這一切結束後我想要什麼嗎？
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1025
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,688
就是一個大空間
Just α big space, you know,

1026
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,483
讓我的幼蟲能隨意打洞和飛翔
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and.

1027
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,568
你想要什麼？
What do you want?

1028
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:25,530
我要喬治歐在失敗中煎熬
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1029
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,742
我知道你們是”永世宿敵
I get you guys are all"eternal nemesis,

1030
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,577
性感又邪惡的糾葛”之類的 但是…
sexy evil tension"and stuff, but...

1031
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,995
警報
SHIP COMPUTER: Alert.

1032
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,413
發現來襲艦船
lncoming vessel.

1033
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,333
檢測到碰撞軌道
Collision trajectory detected.

1034
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,627
果然她把船弄起來了
Of course she got it off the ground.

1035
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,006
我說我們該用魚雷
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1036
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,261
他們發現我們了
QUASI: They've picked us up.

1037
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,222
光子魚雷來襲
GARRETT: Photon torpedo incoming.

1038
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,557
-還有五秒四… -現在真該躲開！
Impact in five, fourReally want to take evqsive action right now!

1039
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:56,102
-三 二 一 -誇西保持航向 全力防護罩
...three, two, one. Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1040
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,401
她為什麼不改變航向？
Why isn't she changing course?

1041
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,028
我又不是算命的
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1042
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,158
牽引光束的能量夠用了嗎？
ALOK: Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1043
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,993
夠了 但我們承受不住再一次直接命中
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1044
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,830
魚雷來襲 五 四…
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1045
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,124
-穩住 馬上就到了…… -三 二 一
Keep it steady. We're almost there...three, two, one.

1046
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,835
就是現在
ALOK: Now.

1047
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,389
警報 導航控制暫停
SHIP COMPUTER: Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1048
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,141
他們想幹嘛 把我們拖垮？
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1049
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,646
她想阻止我回到帝國
SAN: She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1050
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,189
哦
Oh.

1051
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,194
大家覺得這情況如何？
How's everybody feeling αbout this?

1052
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,404
這是唯一的辦法
GEORGIOU: It's the only way.

1053
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,655
這能成功
This can work.

1054
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,532
輻射會削弱他們的防護罩
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1055
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,535
是啊 問題是輻射也會影響到我們
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1056
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:58,248
目標鎖定故障
SHIP COMPUTER: Target lock malfunction.

1057
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,001
無法鎖定魚雷 炮塔離線
Ican't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1058
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,502
桑？
San?

1059
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,755
桑
San.

1060
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,549
桑！
: San!

1061
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,018
輻射水平已達臨界值
SCOW COMPUTER: Rαdiation levels critical.

1062
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,229
防護罩已失效 重覆 防護罩已失效！
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1063
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,859
桑的呢？
And San's?

1064
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,694
他的只剩12% 而且還在快速下降
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1065
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:28,987
等離子體來襲！
QUASI: Plasma incoming!

1066
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,447
要是挨上這樣一下
We get caught with a burst like that,

1067
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,698
我們就完了
and we're done.

1068
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,034
這太混亂了 加勒特
This is chaos, Garrett.

1069
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,535
你知道你喜歡這樣 嗯？
You know you love it, hmm?

1070
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,414
也許該接受它 跟它親熱一下
Mqybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1071
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,458
這就是星際艦隊派你來這的原因
lt's why Starfleet put you here.

1072
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,293
混亂就是我的炮友
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1073
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,545
對 加勒特 讓我們玩個痛快
Yeαh, Garrett, let's get messy.

1074
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,505
-嗯？ -好啊
Hmm? - Okay.

1075
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,257
-交給你了 誇西 -嗯
You got this, Quas. Uh- huh.

1076
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,550
準備好了嗎？
You ready?

1077
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,093
桑的防護罩只剩4%了
GARRETT: Sαn's shields are at four percent.

1078
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,889
現在是2%
Two now.

1079
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,766
他的防護罩失效了
His shields are down.

1080
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,225
可以行動了
Good to go.

1081
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,807
菲利帕！
SAN: Philippa!

1082
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,773
這場較量只有
This contest only ends

1083
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:50,068
一方死去才會結束！
when one of us is dead!

1084
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:59,202
開始引爆程序
GODSEND COMPUTER: Detonation sequence activating.

1085
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,580
你看 我們納米人不需要聯邦
See, the Nanokins, we don't need the Federation.

1086
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,915
從來都不需要
We never have.

1087
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,460
在你們這些巨獸發現我們之前 我們就是統治者
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1088
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,338
等你們消失後 我們還會繼續統治
αnd we will rule again after you're gone.

1089
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,473
猜猜誰能在大爆炸中存活？
Guess who survives very Iarge explosions.

1090
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,978
非常小的生物
Very small things.

1091
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:28,064
現在失陪了 我要去切斷我們的船
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to cut our ship loose.

1092
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,275
抱歉如果你的朋友因此喪命
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1093
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,110
不 我開玩笑的
No, I'm joking.

1094
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,528
我等不及要殺了他們
I can't wait to kill them.

1095
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,406
再見了 你們這些大塊頭的廢物！
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1096
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,215
誰在駕駛那艘船？
Who's flying that?

1097
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:58,053
呃 根據傳感器顯示 只有一個微小的生命體
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life- form on board,

1098
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,888
而且正朝我們飛來
αnd it's heading right for us.

1099
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,476
鎖定導彈
Plot missile lock.

1100
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
我們只有垃圾 對 就只有垃圾
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1101
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:27,874
只剩一個
BOTH: But one.

1102
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,084
桑
YOUNG GEORGIOU: San.

1103
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,928
等待生物特征信號確認
GODSEND COMPUTER: Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1104
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:42,597
我鎖定了法茲的穿梭機
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1105
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,099
他正返回桑的船上
He's heading back to San's ship.

1106
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,518
-我們勉強跟上了 -別跟丟他
We're barely keeping up. - Stay on him.

1107
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,269
呃 我們沒有任何武器
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1108
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,896
我們有一船艙的垃圾
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1109
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,231
別讓那艘穿梭機跑了
Do not lose that shuttle.

1110
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,690
好的
Okay.

1111
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,198
我什麼都不是
SAN: I was nothing!

1112
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,034
那個男孩軟弱無能
That boy was soft, weak.

1113
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,122
但在你的壓迫下 這些年讓我成長到今天
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1114
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,125
帝國軍即將通過傳送門
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1115
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,292
我的帝國
My Empire!

1116
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,503
我們將以仁慈統治這個宇宙
And we will reign over this universe

1117
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:17,298
不像你那樣殘暴
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1118
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:22,929
沒有仁慈的獨裁者 聖
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1119
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,520
這是你教會我的
You taught me that.

1120
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,815
我們還能挽回
We can come back from this.

1121
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,654
重新開始
We can start over.

1122
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,629
我愛混亂
GARRETT: Oh, Ilove chaos.

1123
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,298
混亂才是我的菜
Chaos is my jam.

1124
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,383
我愛混亂 我愛混亂
I love chaos. I love chaos.

1125
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,969
加勒特 你在下面幹什麼
QUASI: Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1126
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,762
誇西 我可是受過訓練的星際艦隊軍官
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1127
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,973
我要活到當上艦長的那天
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1128
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,641
你得相信我 好嗎
You got to trust me, okay?

1129
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,977
你好啊
ODD VOICE: Hi there.

1130
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,687
真高興你找到我
I'm so glad you found me.

1131
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,022
你剛說什麼
What'd you just say?

1132
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,983
呃...呃…
GARRETT: Uh...uh...

1133
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,276
這是個玩具
lt's αtoy.

1134
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,153
看起來像是來自德羅姆星球的
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1135
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,614
我們一起玩點有趣的吧
Shall we do something fun together?

1136
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,699
哇 哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1137
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,784
你還好吧 星際艦隊
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1138
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,953
哇
: Whoa.

1139
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,749
來吧 來吧 來吧 來吧 好
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1140
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,835
我們不讓德羅姆科技進入聯邦
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1141
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,588
因為他們用特倫礦作為能源
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1142
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,798
你是要炸死我們對吧
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1143
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,051
最好祈禱這艘船的船體
You better hope that this ship's hull

1144
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,053
是用托莫海特加固的
is reinforced with Tomohite.

1145
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:13,248
我是個科學官
I am α science officer.

1146
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,000
科學就是可控的混亂
And science is just controlled chaos.

1147
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,670
混亂 混亂 混亂 混亂 混亂
Whoa, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos!

1148
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,433
啊 快點
Ah, come on.

1149
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,936
起來 你這笨機器人
Get up, you stupid robot.

1150
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,251
不 不
No. No.

1151
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,711
不
No!

1152
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,634
待在費茲的船前面 這樣我們就能打開貨艙
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship so we can open the payload bay.

1153
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,594
呃 對
Uh, yeah.

1154
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,430
關於這個
About that.

1155
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,057
誇西 馬上就要發生巨大爆炸了
Uh, thing is...Quasi, there's about to be α very large explosion.

1156
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,143
這控制台用的是我不認識的語言
This console's in α language I don't know.

1157
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,561
我能破譯一些
I can decipher some of it.

1158
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,979
我只需要把它分解成詞素
I just have to break it down to morphemes

1159
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,647
然後你知道的…巨大爆炸即將發生
αnd, you know...Large explosion impending.

1160
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,317
這兩個按鈕任一個都可能打開貨艙
Either of these two buttons could open the cargo bay.

1161
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,609
那就兩個都按
Okay, so push them both.

1162
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:24,819
這兩個按鈕任一個也可能
Either of these two buttons could also

1163
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,154
啟動自毀程序
initiate a self- destruct protocol.

1164
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,448
反正我們都要爆炸了
- We're gonnα blow up anyway. - Uh- huh.

1165
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,825
誇西 誇西 看著我
- Um, uh. Huh? - Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

1166
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,660
你只需要做個決定
You just need to make o call.

1167
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,120
你知道該怎麼做
You know what to do.

1168
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,747
好吧 好
Okoy. Okay.

1169
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,384
呃
Uh.

1170
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,846
我們可以永遠做朋友
We can be friends forever...

1171
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,058
想聽個有趣的事嗎
Do you want to hear something funny?

1172
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,976
我在自動駕駛
I'm on autopilot.

1173
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,070
見鬼了
What the hell?

1174
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,906
我們都要死了
DROOM DOLL: We're all gonna die.

1175
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,659
我們都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1176
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,080
不
No!

1177
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,917
和你在一起真是太美好了
lt's wonderful just to be with you.

1178
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,506
好耶

1179
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:10,758
成功
Yes!

1180
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,828
現在就死吧
Die now.

1181
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:43,082
去告訴你的家人你變了多少
Go tell your family how much you've changed.

1182
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,682

01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,046
永遠
Forever.

1204
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:22,473
離子風暴即將匯聚

1205

電腦 鎖定通道

目標鎖定確認
SHIP COMPUTER: Target lock confirmed.

1210
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,441
如果能回到過去
GEORGIOU: If you could go back,

1211
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,276
當你跪在吉里面前時
αnd you were kneeling in front of Giri,

1212
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,111
你會殺了她嗎
would you kill her?

1213
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,115
你願意終結所有的痛苦和煙霧
Would you put a stop to all the suffering and smoke forever,

1214
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,785
即使這意味著你必須死去
even if it meant that you had to die?

1215
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,294
會
Yes.

1216
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:38,299
很高興認識你 阿洛克·薩哈爾

1219
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,486
傳感器顯示他們啟動了脈沖引擎

1220
01:25:58,612 --> 01:25:59,862
什麼
What?

1221
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,489

好的好的好的好的
QUASI: Okay, okay, okoy, okay.

1224
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:08,704
風暴幹擾太強 我無法鎖定他們
The storm's interfering. I can't lock on to them.

1225
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,425
