1
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,340
命运如铸剑之人 提前锻造万物
-埃斯库罗斯

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,650
人类帝国

3
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,680
她回来了 她终于回到家了
She's back! She's home!

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,220
菲利帕回家了
Philippa came home!

5
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,100
两年过去了
Two years,

6
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,150
一切都和记忆中一模一样
and everything looks exactly as I remember.

7
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,150
我以为再也见不到这里了
I never thought I would see this place again.

8
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,530
这一次我们有18个人
There were 18 of us this time.

9
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,370
从帝国各个角落被选中
Culled from every corner of the Empire

10
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,120
带到地球参加比试
and brought to Terra for the contest.

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,630
他们说只有一个人能活到最后
We were told that only one of us would survive

12
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,880
熬过这些年
the years to come.

13
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,130
一个孩子…
One child.

14
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,890
…最纯粹的帝国血脉
...the purest expression of the Terran identity.

15
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,020
他们让我们自相残杀
They pitted us against each other.

16
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,230
一个月又一个月 我们的人数不断减少
And month by month, our numbers dwindled.

17
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,360
你...你赢了吗
Did...did you win?

18
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,740
结束了吗
ls it over?

19
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,950
还剩下两个人
Two of us still live.

20
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,580
桑和我
San and me.

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,880
我和桑
Me and San.

22
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,880
我们是二人
We are two...

23
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,470
…却如一人
...but one.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,510
永远如此
Forever.

25
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,230
比试期间”朋友”这个词是被禁止的
The word "friend" was forbidden during the contest,

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,610
但无人时我们会悄悄对彼此说出这个词
but we whispered it to each other when no one could hear.

27
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,860
桑和我联手对抗
San and I combined our skills

28
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,450
总督和其他参赛者
against the proctor and the other contestants.

29
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,120
但只能有一个人成为皇帝
But only one of you could be emperor.

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
还剩最后一个任务
One task remains.

31
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,920
谁先完成谁就能统治帝国
The first to complete it rules the Empire,

32
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,750
另一个人余生都将
and the other spends the rest of their life

33
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,920
侍奉新皇帝
in servitude to the new emperor.

34
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,210
你们要做什么
What do you have to do?

35
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,070
你做了什么
What did you do? !

37
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,070
不允许与过去有任何牵绊
No ties to the old life are permitted.

38
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,660
皇帝只能忠于职责
An emperor can only be loyal to duty.

39
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,910
帝国因此而强大
"Thus does the Empire remain strong.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,370
帝国因此而强盛”
Thus does it grow. "

41
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,550
-妈妈 -菲利帕
Mom. Philippa.

42
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,760
你成功了 而你的对手失败了
You succeeded where your competitor could not.

43
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,850
把他带上来
Bring him here.

44
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,900
桑没有力量通过最后的考验
San did not have the strength to pass the final test.

45
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,490
此刻他的村庄正在燃烧 昭示着他的懦弱
Even now, his village burns as a testament to his cowardice.

46
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,580
我爱你
I love you.

47
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,580
你赢了这场较量
You have won the contest.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
来领取你的胜利吧
Claim your victory.

49
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,270
桑 上前来
San, step forward.

50
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,820
你如今只为臣服于她而活
You live now only to serve at her heel.

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,370
跪拜吧 向掌控你生命的人
Kneel before the one who owns your life.

52
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,600
我们本为二者…
We are two...

53
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,140
却合为一体
But one.

54
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,600
但这一切已经结束了
Not anymore.

55
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,010
向乔治欧陛下致敬
AII hail Philippa Georgiou!

56
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,800
向帝王致敬
AlI hail the emperor!

57
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,350
致敬 致敬 致敬
Hail! Hail! Hail!

58
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,640
致敬
Hail!

59
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,570
这里是指挥部
This is Control

60
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,530
向阿尔法小队队长发送优先级消息
with a priority message for Alpha Team Leader.

61
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,960
你的目标是菲利帕 乔治欧
Your subject is Emperor Philippa Georgiou,

62
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,620
特伦帝国的前任统治者
former ruler of the Terran Empire.

63
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,380
她来自一个平行宇宙
lt's in a parallel universe

64
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,800
那里的罪犯数量之多
with the most criminal population

65
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,170
史无前例
in recorded history.

66
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,680
即便在那里 乔治欧的暴行也是最令人发指的
Even there, Georgiou had the market cornered on atrocities.

67
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,310
2257年 她被带到我们的宇宙
ln 2257, she was brought to our universe

68
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,100
加入了31区
and joined Section 31,

69
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,020
但几年后我们失去了联系
but after a few years, we lost contact.

70
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,980
最近 乔治欧用假身份出现
Recently, Georgiou was spotted using an alias

71
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,450
在联邦空间外的边境地带
in the border territory outside Federation space,

72
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,530
我们正在那里追踪黑市上的一个新威胁
where we're tracking a new threat on the black market.

73
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,790
这就是你们小队的任务
This is where your team comes in.

74
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,750
联邦条约禁止我们越过那条边境线
Federation treaty forbids us from crossing over that border,

75
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,290
这意味着星际舰队不能直接插手
which means Starfleet cannot get its hands dirty.

76
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,840
你和你的31区小队将潜入 与乔治欧取得联系
You and your 31 team will go in, make contact with Georgiou

77
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,180
帮助识别并消除这个威胁
to help identify and neutralize the threat.

78
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,970
但要记住…
But make no mistqke...

79
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,970
这条恶犬会咬人 小心你们的后背
this dog bites, so watch your backs.

80
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,480
你们有24小时完成任务
You have 24 hours to complete the mission.

81
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,520
开始行动吧
Get to work.

82
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,450
星际述肌: 31区

83
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,390
星历1292. 4

84
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,830
杜弗朗克夫人
Madame du Franc?

85
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,210
蜜月套房发生了点小意外
Small incident in the honeymoon suite.

86
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,750
恐怕那位新娘在关键时刻
I'm afraid the bride molted

87
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,630
蜕皮了
just as things were coming to a climax.

88
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,300
维吉尔 说重点
Virgil, get to the point. -

89
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,930
我已派生化危机小组前去 并转达了您的慰问
I sent a biohazard team and your condolences.

90
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,850
另外 有位客人希望能与您谈谈
Also, there's a customer hoping for a word with you.

91
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,520
他看起来很清醒 但却令人着迷
He seems entirely sober but quite intoxicating.

92
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,570
杜弗朗克夫人愿意见您
Mqdame Veronique du Franc will see you.

93
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,830
阿洛克 萨哈尔 见过杜弗朗克夫人
Alok Sahar, Madame Veronique du Franc.

94
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,080
杜弗朗克夫人通常需要预约才见客
Madame du Franc normally does business by appointment.

95
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,670
我想预约
I'd like to make an oppointment.

96
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,260
哦 这位先生想预约呢
Oh, the gentleman would like to make an appointment.

97
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,510
现在 现在 夫人
Now. Now, madam.

98
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,880
不可能 不可能
Impossible.Impossible.

99
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,570
再见 维吉尔
Au revoir, Virgil.

100
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,040
这是违法的
That is illegal.

101
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,630
而这能赚钱
And that makes money.

102
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,880
这是家正经场所
This is a reputable establishment.

103
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,420
我听说不是
Not what I heard.

104
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,800
不如去你办公室谈谈 嗯？
- Why don't we discuss it in your office? - umm.

105
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,970
我为什么要带你去我的办公室 阿洛克 萨哈尔？
Why would I take you to my office, Alok Sahar?

106
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,930
因为这需要亲身体验
Because it's a hands- on experience.

107
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,750
甜蓟花
Dulcet thistle.

108
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,660
甜蓟花已经灭绝了
Dulcet thistle's extinct.

109
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,420
我有十二公斤这玩意
I've got a dozen keys of this stuff.

110
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,090
要来点吗？
Have you partaken?

111
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,300
这会是我少有的第一次体验之一
This would be one of my few first times.

112
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,380
劲很大
Packs a punch.

113
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,300
让人愉悦的那种
- Ahappy punch. Mmm.

114
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,650
干杯
Bottoms up.

115
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,400
为金钱 为你
- To money. To you.

116
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,630
现在 别装了
Now, let's cut the shit.

117
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,630
31区来我的空间站做什么?
What is Section 31 doing in my space station?

118
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,050
嗯？以为我认不出特工吗？
umm? You think I don't know an agent when I see one?

119
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
你带着六名特工
You're heading up a team of six operatives,

120
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,470
他们都在酒吧里
and they're dll over the bar.

121
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
那边那个变形者
There's the Chameloid,

122
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,230
绿血的变种人
a green- blooded shape- shifter,

123
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,190
正试图勾引一个德尔塔人
trying to muster sexy time with a Deltan,

124
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,900
一个活生生的诱饵
a walking honey trap

125
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,150
31区显然在用她转移注意力
31's obviously using as a distraction.

126
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,120
但变形者是银河系唯一
Except Chameloids are the only species in the galaxy

127
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,740
对德尔塔人魅力免疫的种族
immune to Deltan sexy time charm.

128
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,330
还有那边那个全身高科技装备的家伙
Then there's the guy with all the high- end mech,

129
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,460
站在后面一副若有所思的样子
standing in the back, looking like he has thoughts.

130
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,460
机械生命不只是靠蛮力
Mech life, it ain't just about the brute force.

131
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,180
我猜 武器很重 智商很轻
I'mgonna say heavy on artillery, low on IQ.

132
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,220
真遗憾
I'm so sorry.

133
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,680
别忘了那个瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

134
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,350
笑得比台上的笑话还夸张
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

135
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,270
瓦肯人从不笑所以他要么也是个蠢货
And since Vulcans never laugh, he's either an idiot, too,

136
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,820
要么是庞法导致精神失常
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

137
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,660
得了吧 这很好笑
Oh, come on. That was funny.

138
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,450
还有你安排的那个一本正经的人类…
And the very serious human you stuck him with.

139
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,200
收敛点吧
Reel it in anytime.

140
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,540
她屁股里的棍子插得太深了
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

141
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
都从嘴里冒出来了
it's coming out her mouth.

142
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,080
收敛点
Just reel it in.

143
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,090
那是
That would be

144
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,180
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett.

145
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,090
星际舰队
Starfleet.

146
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,760
欢乐的终结者
Where fun goes to die.

147
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,890
你们找到我花了够久的
It took you long enough to find me.

148
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,020
我们知道你在巴拉姆
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

149
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,320
总有一天会对我们有用
would be valuable to us one day.

150
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,940
我现在可没什么动力
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

151
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,910
为别人效力
to anyone but myself.

152
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,920
那么 我们是不是该开始谈条件了？
So, is this where we start negotiating?

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,210
嗯 那要看情况
umm, that depends.

154
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,380
你知道我多久了
How long have you known about me?

155
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,130
从你接手前任店主开始
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

156
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,840
那人至今下落不明
who we still haven't found.

157
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,180
听着
Well, all of.

158
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,310
-不是我干的 -皇帝
That wasn't me. Emperor Georgiou,

159
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,810
我被授权逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

160
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,810
并抹除你的记忆
and wipe your mind clean. -

161
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,270
但我内心有个声音
But then again, there's a part of me

162
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,690
想让你继续带着这些记忆活着
that wants you to live with your memories.

163
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,280
那些大屠杀的记忆
The genocidal ones.

164
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,110
你有权逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

165
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,370
不代表你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

166
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,120
你真想让31区 让我
You really want Section 31 want me- -

167
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,960
一直追着你不放吗
dogging you until the end of time?

168
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
真无聊
Boring.

169
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,710
过去总会追上你
The past always catches up with you.

170
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,880
不管你我是否承认
And as much as both of us

171
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,130
我这是在帮你
might hate it, I'm doing you a favor.

172
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,510
最后一个任务
One lqst mission.

173
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,640
听着
Listen.

174
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,640
你相信命运吗
Do you believe in fate?

175
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,350
我相信
Becouse I do.

176
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,690
你逃不过命运
You can't hide from it.

177
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,060
你在这里什么都不是 乔治欧
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

178
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,200
我给你机会重返战场
I'm giving you a chance to get back in.

179
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
参与银河系级别的行动
In on the action on a galactic scale.

180
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,700
别再逃避了
Stop running from it.

181
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,080
做回真正的自己
Be who you are.

182
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,380
或者继续在这当一辈子酒保
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

183
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,510
开始吧
Let's get on with it.

184
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,690
菲利帕 乔治欧 来见见我的团队
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.

185
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,530
这是梅勒
This is Melle.

186
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,030
泽夫
Zeph.

187
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
你像个瑞士军刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

188
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,200
等等
Uh, hold on.

189
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,870
我不知道那是什么 但我不会
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

190
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,120
站在这被侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

191
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,580
我说的不是你
I'm not talking about you.

192
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,540
说的是你的战甲
I'm talking about your suit.

193
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,550
你是新来的
Um, you're new,

194
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,590
我就说这一次
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

195
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
当你说起战甲的时候
that when you are talking about the suit,

196
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,970
就是在说泽夫本人
you're talking about Zeph.

197
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,220
-噢 -泽夫患有
- Oh.  Zeph suffers from

198
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,890
所谓的机甲畸形症
what we call mecha dysmorphia.

199
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,890
虽然我不知道那是什么
And I may not know what that is,

200
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,310
但我也不会接受
but I'm also not gonna take that

201
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,980
你这么说 夸西 我很生气
from you, Quas, and personally I'm offended.

202
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,480
-你得知道... -这是事实
- I think you should know...- Well, it's accurate.

203
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,650
这不是诊断结果 你又不是医生
It's not a diagnosis. You're not a doctor.

204
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,070
泽夫 泽夫 泽夫
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

205
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,400
-他知道 他都知道 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

206
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
他知道
He knows.

207
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,780
-他明白 他明白 -是的
He gets it. He gets it. Yes.

208
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,320
那个瓦肯人呢
Okay, what obout that Vulcan?

209
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,780
没人告诉她吗
Nobody told her?

210
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,790
这个 你说的这个
This? The thing you're talking to?

211
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,950
瓦肯人只是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

212
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,910
我在里面
I'm inside.

213
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
操控着它
Driving.

214
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,140
我从后备载具里控制这具身体
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

215
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,010
用它进入一些狭小空间
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

216
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,180
嗨你好
Hi there.

217
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,230
我是弗兹
I'm Fuzz.

218
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,850
弗兹是纳米族
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

219
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,360
很有趣的家伙
Real fun- loving guy.

220
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,730
你好
Hello.

221
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,940
除了他发起疯来的时候
Except for when he's not.

222
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,690
那时他就失控 有暴力倾向
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

223
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,150
你说第一点就够了 夸西
Well, you could've stopped at the first thing, Quasi.

224
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,490
盗版瓦肯载具
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

225
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,250
黑市上一定有不少好东西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

226
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,960
纳米族都爱捡破烂
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

227
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,920
31区第一次接触他们
31 made first contact when

228
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,880
是在一艘废弃飞船上发现了他们的寄生
we discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

229
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,880
-夸西 -糟了
Quasi. Oh, shit.

230
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,300
再说一遍寄生 夸西
Say"infestation"one more time, Quasi.

231
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,380
说啊 叫我捡破烂的 你这团黑灰
Soy"scavenger, "you sack of amorphous soot!

232
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,180
我...说完我就后悔了
l- ls- - I heard it as soon as I said it.

233
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,550
我要揍你
I will kick your ass

234
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
揍到你连个形状都凝聚不了
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

235
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,470
弗兹 弗兹 冷静
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

236
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,140
我很冷静
I am locked down.

237
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,400
我被困在这个巨大的机器瓦肯头里
I'm trapped inside a giant robot Vulcan head.

238
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,820
还有谁比我更冷静
No one is more locked down than me right now!

239
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,490
纳米族的情绪波动很奇怪
Nanokins have o wonky emotional spectrum.

240
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,490
不 不 我不会
No, no, no, no, no, no, Iwillnot

241
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,780
接受你的轻视 梅勒
be condescended to, Melle,

242
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,450
尤其是你 说实话…
particularly not by you, because honest.

243
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,540
我爱你 你太完美了
Ilove you. You are everything.

244
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,250
-我这情绪你喜欢吗 -弗兹
Does my spectrum work for you? -  Fuzz.

245
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,750
-就是说 你觉得如何… -弗兹
- Imean, like, like, are you into it or...- Fuzz!

246
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,790
弗兹
Fuzz!

247
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,300
她在羞辱你 伙计
She's insulting you, pal.

248
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,010
我知道德尔塔人就这德行
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

249
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,220
但你也该有点自尊吧
but have a little self- respect, would you?

250
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,510
我们继续吗
Can we continue?

251
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,220
这位是瑞秋 加勒特中尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Gorrett.

252
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,680
她只为这次任务临时加入31区
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

253
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,560
你得罪了谁才来黑ops的 中尉
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

254
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,980
星际舰队是来确保我们守规矩的
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

255
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,360
星际舰队是来保卫联邦
Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

256
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,360
维护和平 防止谋杀发生的
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

257
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,900
-那你呢 -等一下
And you? - One moment.

258
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,320
夸西进入我的视野
Quasi came on my radar

259
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,870
是因为他证实了神经簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

260
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,660
神经簇只是理论上存在
Glioclusters are theoretical.

261
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,290
曾经是理论上存在
Formerly theoretical.

262
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,960
生命就是无数分支的可能性
Life is just branching possibilities.

263
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,130
你知道它们会以你想象不到的方式绽放
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

264
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,250
比如说 我现在可能会被你吓到
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

265
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,300
毕竟 你杀过
I mean, after all, you've murdered

266
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,800
那么多人…
so many people.

267
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,970
而你似乎正在洞穿我的灵魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

268
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,640
我可以对此做出回应
I could respond to that

269
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,100
或者我可以观察当下的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

270
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,680
把它锁起来 专注于该做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

271
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,480
或者…夸斯 选一个吧
- Or...- Quas. Pick one. umm?

272
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,230
好的 有时夸斯会看到
Yes. Sometimes Quasi sees

273
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,150
太多选择而大脑当机 谢谢你 梅勒
so many options he gets brain- freeze. - Thank you, Melle.

274
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
夸斯 我们继续好吗 嗯
- Quasi, can we carryon, please?

275
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,280
我们的目标是达达 诺伊
Our target's name is Dqda Noe.

276
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,990
道德观念成问题
Dubious moral compass.

277
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,740
他曾在瓦特殖民地经营一家病理实验室 后来叛逃了
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

278
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,250
从那以后 他一直在按需设计生物武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

279
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,960
诺伊正在前往巴拉姆 准备把他最新的作品
Noe's on his way to the Baraam to sell his latest creation

280
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,630
卖给米诺斯最高议会
to the Minosian High Council.

281
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,630
虽然我们与米诺斯势力没有正式敌对
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

282
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,420
但如果他们得到这种
but that could change if they get their hands

283
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,880
超级武器 情况就会改变
on a superweapon.

284
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,760
我们知道这种生物超级武器是什么吗
Dowe know what this bio superweapon is?

285
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,850
不知道 但既然是达达 诺伊在卖 肯定很糟
No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

286
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,470
所以你们要确保这笔交易不会发生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

287
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,850
怎么做
How?

288
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,310
虽然你发现我们时计划出了差错
Things went south when you spotted us,

289
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
但计划依然可行
but the plan is still solid.

290
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,780
首先 阿洛克要...
First, Alok was going to...

291
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,650
你可以说出来
You can soy it.

292
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,990
搭讪
Connect.

293
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
你
With you.

294
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,990
欢迎光临 嗯
Welcome! Yes.

295
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,830
多可爱的想法
What o cute idea.

296
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,210
趁你被分散注意力时
Once we had you suitably distracted,

297
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,300
夸斯就能做他擅长的另一件事
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

298
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,460
好了 夸斯
Okay, Quasi.

299
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,260
请开始吧 当然
If you would do the honors. Absolutely.

300
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,310
让我们开工吧
Let's get to work.

301
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
欢迎 达达 诺伊
Welcome, Dada Noe.

302
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,570
这就到了弗兹登场的时候
This is where Fuzz comes in.

303
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,750
你不会相信我能钻进多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

304
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,250
比如 体型改造装置的内部结构
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

305
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,750
一旦我飞进达达的体型改造装置
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

306
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
就该大显身手了
well, then it's time to get to work.

307
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,210
那么多电路
So many circuits.

308
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,930
那么多可能出错的地方
So many things that could go wrong.

309
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,840
这位能力至上主义者会指导我
Competency crusader here will talk me through

310
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,300
植入物的技术细节
the tech on the implant.

311
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,470
如果我觉得改动那个植入物会
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

312
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,890
危及达达 诺伊的生命
by tinkering with that implant,

313
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,440
我就会让星际舰队全面介入
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

314
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,100
这次行动
on this whole operotion.

315
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,310
拜托 我们说的可是个把超级武器卖给
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

316
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,320
任何有拉锡姆卡的三流恐怖分子的家伙
to any third- rate terrorist with a Lotinum card.

317
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,150
听好了 废品佬
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

318
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,110
星际舰队不做暗杀
Starfleet does not do assassinotions.

319
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,780
得了 别把你的主要指令搞得一团乱
Ay, don't get your prime directives in a bunch.

320
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,120
你不会弄脏自己的手
You are not going to get your hands dirty

321
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
破坏自己成为舰长的机会
and mess up your chances of becoming captain.

322
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,790
我可是顶尖的科学官
I'm atop- tier science officer.

323
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,870
蛮横的家伙 死板鬼
Butt pretzel. - : Tight- ass.

324
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,750
真没礼貌
So disrespectful.

325
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
等加勒特和弗兹切断那个连接…
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link.

326
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,010
他就会被我们控制 我会在泽夫的帮助下
...he'll be under our control, and I'll take him down

327
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,430
制服他 嗯
with the help of Zeph.

328
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,100
这才叫打击 一个
That's what I callahit. - One.

329
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,230
在买家到达巴拉姆之前
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

330
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,060
达达 诺伊和他的病原体就会被捕
before the buyers cqn even show up to the Baraam.

331
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,320
我们进去又出来
And we are in nd out.

332
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,940
嗯 不过…
Mm. Meh.

333
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
不过
Meh?

334
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
我有个更简单的主意
I have o simpler idea.

335
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,010
欢迎 诺伊先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

336
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,800
很荣幸您光临巴拉姆
We're honored to have you here at the Bqraam.

337
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,680
我是维罗妮克 杜弗朗克 这里的主人
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

338
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
我说过要准备好我的套房
I told them to have my suite ready.

339
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,890
当然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

340
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,230
让我带您去房间
May lescort you to your quarters?

341
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,690
来吧
Come.

342
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,020
我们有最精致的…
We have the most exquisite

343
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,610
我不敢相信你会相信这个反社会者
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

344
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,110
好吧 中尉
Well, Lieutenant,

345
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,400
你得做该做的事
you got to do what you got to do,

346
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,530
而我对反社会者还挺熟悉的
and l'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

347
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,870
我说过不要带我来
I said don't bring me.

348
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,370
希望您一路顺风 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

349
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,660
你们的人确实把一切都安排得很妥当
Well, your people made everything easy.

350
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,290
这是我们的荣幸 到了
Our pleasure. Here we are.

351
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,970
真俗气
So tacky.

352
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,720
不过这就是你的风格
But I guess that's what you're known for.

353
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,020
这是什么
What's this?

354
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,390
这叫相位舱
It's called a phase pod.

355
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,020
我的一个客户送给我的
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

356
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,440
我也给自己弄了一个
and I got one for myself, too.

357
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,700
你在干什么
What are you doing?

358
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,370
宇宙中的一切都以
Everything in the universe vibrates

359
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
特定的波长振动
- on acertain wavelength. -

360
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,370
该死
Damn it.

361
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,880
把箱子还给我
Give me back my case.

362
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,380
不
No.

363
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,470
这要从你的安全押金里扣除
That's coming out of your security deposit.

364
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,390
相位舱会改变
The phase pod changes the wavelength

365
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,050
它们接触物体的波长
of whatever they touch.

366
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,310
我与你相位不同 你也与我相位不同
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

367
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,520
但我与你的箱子相位相同
Iam, however, in phase with your case.

368
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,230
我要把它带走
And I will be taking it with me.

369
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,110
你不知道你惹上了什么麻烦
You have no idea what you've started.

370
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,990
糟糕了
Whoops

371
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,870
令人印象深刻
lmpressive.

372
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,460
你确定你是人类吗
Are you sure you're human?

373
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
大多数时候是
Most days.

374
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,250
谢谢
Thank you.

375
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,000
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

376
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,360
你是谁
Who are you?

377
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,290
他往那边跑了 那边 那边 那边 那边
He went that way. That way, that woy, that way, that way!

378
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,850
天啊 是外星人
Oh, aliens.

379
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,430
-赤身裸体的外星人 -快追 泽夫
- Naked aliens. -  Go, Zeph, go.

380
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,700
他朝休息室去了 天哪 他们跑得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

381
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,460
梅勒 他朝你那边去了
: Melle, he's coming to you.

382
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,210
天啊
Yikes.

383
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,970
没事
No, it's okoy.

384
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,560
-我没事 -梅勒 抓到他了吗
- l'm all right. - Melle, you got him?

385
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,720
抓到了
Got him.

386
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,890
哇喔
Ooh- la- la!

387
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,600
天啊
Ay, amor.

388
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,360
这不可能
That's not possible.

389
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,900
我明明销毁了它
I had that destroyed.

390
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,160
不 不
No. No!

391
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,660
这不可能
lt's not possible.

392
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,200
你认识那件武器
You knew that weapon.

393
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,250
那是什么
What is it?

394
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,750
那是什么
What is it?

395
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,590
好吧 那就来硬的
Fine. The hard way.

396
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,420
永恒祈求者请求觐见
The Eternal Supplicant begs opproach.

397
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,790
准予觐见
You have my permission.

398
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,590
至高无上的陛下
AlI hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

399
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,930
祖国之母

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,100
-火山星的统治者 -什么事

401
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,100
已经完成了 陛下
lt is finished, Your Majesty.

402
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,810
我的工程师们呢
Where are my engineers?

403
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,690
他们…完工后就自尽了
: They...they took their own lives upon completion.

404
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,330
桑 你为谁而哭
Who is the tear for, San?

405
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,290
说吧

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,020
我问你 桑
I asked you a question, San.

410
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,480
你为何为我哭泣
Why do you cry for me?

411
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,820
看着我
Look ot me.

412
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,490
你还记得我们是谁吗
Do you remember who we were?

413
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,660
在这一切之前
Before oll this.

414
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,580
那个求知若渴的男孩
The curious boy.

415
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,380
那个天真无邪的女孩
The innocent girl.

416
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,590
我只记得我的失败 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

417
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,680
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

418
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,430
只有我们能理解
We were the only ones who could understand

419
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,930
活下去需要付出的代价
the cost to stay alive.

420
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,690
我们是一个团队
We made o team.

421
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,190
我们互相需要 不是吗
We needed each other, didn't we?

422
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,110
为了一起活下去
What did we say to carry each other through,

423
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,320
我们说过什么
to survive together?

424
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,160
我们是二…
We are two.

425
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,580
为一体
But one.

426
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,200
我们是二为一体
We are two but one.

427
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,370
如果那时我说
If I said then,

428
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,870
”让我们逃走吧
"Let's run away,

429
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,420
逃离这场竞争
"let's flee this competition

430
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,670
逃离一切束缚我们的地球”
and everything that binds us to Terra, "

431
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,050
你会说什么
what would you have said?

432
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,430
您这个问题的时机比您想象的更富诗意
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

433
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,770
那时的我会说好
I would have said yes.

434
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,070
那时
Then.

435
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,820
但现在呢
But now?

436
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:29,250
您本可以缔造一个美好的统治
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

437
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,960
但您却选择建造这个
lnstead, you chose to build this.

438
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,000
这意味着我认识的那个
That means that innocent girl I knew,

439
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,590
天真无邪的女孩
she hqs been...

440
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,470
已经…死了
: ...murdered.

441
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,640
这是什么
What is this?

442
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,550
你…
You......

443
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,390
你也服了同样的毒
You took the same poison?

444
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,560
不 我不允许你死
No! I forbid you to die!

445
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,610
没有人愿意活在
No one wants to live

446
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,150
您的世界里 皇帝陛下
in your world, Emperor.

447
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,320
您是个暴君
You ore a monster!

448
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,940
这又是什么好地方
And what delightful place is this?

449
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,350
安全屋
A safe house.

450
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,230
但对你来说可能不太安全
But maybe not so safe for you.

451
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,650
你是31区的人
You are Section 31.

452
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,320
为什么不用刑逼我说出答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

453
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,650
你是个暴君
You're a tyrant.

454
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,030
真正的暴君
A real one.

455
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,530
刑讯对你没用
Torture wouldn't work.

456
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,950
你为什么如此了解像我这样的人
How do you know so much about people like me?

457
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,670
你也曾经历过暴政 而且记忆深刻
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

458
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,040
如果你要隐藏这点 就是软弱
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

459
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,090
而我的搭档不能软弱
And I can't have thot in o partner.

460
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,340
-我们不是搭档 -不是吗
- We're not partners. - No?

461
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,220
我帮了很大忙
I've been very helpful.

462
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,060
你的计划本行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

463
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,350
我给了你更好的方案
I gave you a better one.

464
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,810
让你尝到了行动的滋味
You gave me a tqste of the action,

465
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,730
知道你会想要更多
knowing I'd want more.

466
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,860
你需要我
You need me.

467
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,230
你选择了我
You chose me.

468
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,280
为什么
Why?

469
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,570
不管你以为你的任务是什么
Whatever you believed your mission was,

470
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,620
情况比你想象的更糟
it's worse than you thought.

471
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,080
数十亿人命危在旦夕 时间紧迫
Blllions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

472
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,080
你说你的故事 我就说我的
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

473
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,500
这件事要成功 我必须
The only way this works is if I know

474
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,800
完全了解我在和谁打交道
exactly who I'm dealing with.

475
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,600
我也不是这个时代的人
I'm not from this time, either.

476
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,060
我生于20世纪的地球
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

477
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,650
你有350岁了
You are 350 years old?

478
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,070
差不多吧
More or less.

479
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,610
我沉睡了大部分时间
I slept most of that time.

480
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,580
在我被流放后
After my exile.

481
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,580
优生战争时期
The Eugenics Wars.

482
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,750
强化人…
Augments.

483
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,510
夺走了我的星球
took my planet.

484
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
我的家园
My home.

485
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,140
当时我们只有十来个人在战斗
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

486
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,730
我认识的人要么中弹要么被砍死
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

487
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,980
但我也杀了不少敌人
But I gave some back.

488
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,480
她注意到了我
She noticed me.

489
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,860
那个屠杀我家人的改造人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

490
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,950
他们称她为”有印记的吉里”
They called her Giri the Morked.

491
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,910
她收留了我
She took me in.

492
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,120
让我变得比常人更强大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

493
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,670
她把我撕碎
She ripped me opart

494
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,250
改造成她军队里的另一个改造人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

495
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,340
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

496
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,760
都是为了像你这样的魔头
AlI for a monster like you.

497
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:19,140
因为对暴君来说 只有一个选择
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

498
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,560
杀戮
murder.

499
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,190
你还没有杀我
You haven't killed me.

500
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,650
暂时没有
Yet.

501
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,700
我认出了那件武器 因为是我下令制造的
I recognized the weapon because I ordered it to be built.

502
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
召集你的人
Gather your people.

503
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,170
我们需要所有人手
We're gonna need every one of them.

504
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,540
在我的宇宙里 总有人在密谋
In my universe, there were always plotters.

505
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,210
总有政变
Always a coup.

506
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,380
所以我打造了一件武器来消灭所有威胁
So I built a weapon to end all threots.

507
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,220
我称它为天赐
I called it the Godsend.

508
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,930
它会引发连锁反应
It triggers a chain reaction,

509
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,560
像病毒一样在行星间传播
like a virus passing between planets.

510
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,310
所经之处 尽成灰烬
Everything in its poth incinerates.

511
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,900
整个象限都会毁灭
An entire quadrant would be lost.

512
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,270
如果我的敌人设法杀死我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

513
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,440
就再无统治的土地
there would be nothing left to rule.

514
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,240
呃 打扰一下 问个问题
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

515
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,610
抱歉
Sorry.

516
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,570
对 就是 呃 就一个小问题
Yeah, no. Uh, justaqu it's just a quick one.

517
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,240
是天赐还是天谴？
Is it Godsend or God's End?

518
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,290
天赐还是天谴？
Godsend or God's End?

519
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,670
我听不出你说的有什么区别
I don't heara difference in what you're saying.

520
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,090
真的吗？真的吗？天赐 天谴
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

521
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,380
-我还是听不出来 -天赐是…
Yeah, I'm still not getting it. - The Godsend is...

522
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,840
等等 天赐 我现在听出来了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

523
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,800
-是天赐 没有谴字 -赐
lt's Godsend. No apostrophe. Send.

524
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,470
天赐就在这里
The Godsend is here.

525
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,760
怎么可能？它来自另一个宇宙
How? lt's from another universe.

526
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,510
我不知道 但那个人有它
I don't know, but that man had it.

527
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,310
就是你认为是达达诺的人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

528
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,270
我们知道他就是达达诺
The one we know is Dada Noe.

529
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,400
不 他不是你们的达达诺 不可能是
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He cqn't be.

530
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,360
他来自帝联 而且带来了天赐
He's from the Terran Empire, and he brought the Godsend here.

531
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,650
这是他知道天赐的唯一原因
That's the only way he can know about it.

532
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,150
既然我们已经把他关起来了
And since we have him locked up tight,

533
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,990
-我来审问他 -不 不 不
- I'II interrogate him. No, no, no.

534
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,370
-我们不能相信这个女人说的任何话 -对
We cannot trust a single word this woman says. Yeah.

535
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,870
她害死了梅勒
She cost us Melle.

536
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,830
她是唯一知道我们在对付什么的人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

537
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,790
是啊 这是她说的 小弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

538
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,210
小弟？
Little? -

539
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,920
歧视我们小个子！
Scale- shamer!

540
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,670
微生物可比恐龙活得久！
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

541
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,340
冷静点 我是说…
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

542
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,710
我要尿你一身 让你生锈！
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

543
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,380
...她才是搞砸一切的原因
...that she's the reason this is dll bollixed up.

544
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,340
梅勒死是因为她 我们在银河系屁股眼
She's the reason Melle's dead, and she's the reason

545
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,680
也是因为她
we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

546
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,010
都听着
Listen up.

547
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,810
我和乔治欧要回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

548
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,230
达达诺是我们找到天赐的唯一线索
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

549
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,310
所以我们要和他谈谈
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

550
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,040
怎么了？
What?

551
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,080
她是菲利帕 乔治欧
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

552
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,870
至高无上的帝国陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

553
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,750
祖国之母
Mother of the Fatherland.

554
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,090
瓦肯的统治者
Overlord of Vulcan.

555
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,500
克林贡的主宰 安多星的女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

556
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,090
菲利帕 乔治欧 奥古斯都 雅波尼乌斯 森塔利乌斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus laponius Centarius.

557
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,220
厉害
Cool.

558
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,510
还送薯条吗？
That come with fries?

559
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,930
不错吧？
: That was good, right?

560
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,180
好吧
Okay.

561
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,140
每次你不直接回答她的问题
Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

562
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,270
陛下就会打你的脸
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

563
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,230
好吧
: Fine.

564
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,150
我是达达
I'm Doda.

565
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,320
达达诺 就是达达 然后是诺
Dada Noe. just Dada, then Noe.

566
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,740
就这样 中间没别的
That's it. No in- betweens.

567
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,120
然后我...
And l, uh.

568
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,540
我以前在瓦特殖民地管理一个病理实验室
I used to run a pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

569
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,790
搞什么鬼啊？！
What the shit, man? !

570
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,920
你说她会打我脸的！
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

571
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,430
现在我们都说谎了 你不是那个达达
So now we both have lied. You are not that Doda.

572
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,260
你是他们所说的镜像
You're what these people call his Mirror.

573
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,060
你来自帝联
You came here from the Terran Empire,

574
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,480
带来了天赐
and you brought the Godsend.

575
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,230
什么是天赐？
What's the Godsend?

576
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,940
我的战争委员会想要废黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

577
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,280
你知道我是怎么让元帅开口的吗？
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

578
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,330
我是帝国武器设施
I was an administrator

579
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,250
的一名行政官员
at an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

580
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,620
嗯 对
Uh, yeah.

581
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,250
天赐就存放在我的设施里
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

582
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,050
大多数人以为它只是个传说 但我知道它是真的
Most thought it was a legend, but I knew it was real.

583
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,760
所以你想把它卖掉
So you tried to sell it.

584
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,180
对 对
Yeah, yeah.

585
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,760
我想靠卖它的钱在这里安静地生活
I wanted to Iive here quietly on its proceeds.

586
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,600
你是怎么来到我们的宇宙的？
How did you get to our universe?

587
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,560
有一场离子风暴
There was an ion storm.

588
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,610
实际上是两场
Two of them, actually.

589
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,150
当它们按规律汇聚时
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

590
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,410
在帝国边缘撕开了什么东西－
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire- -

591
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,120
他们称之为异象 但其实是一条通道
an anomaly, they called it- but it was a passageway

592
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,160
可以从帝联到达这个地方
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

593
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,330
它通向你们的新月星云
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

594
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,630
知道的人很少 暂时是这样
Few know obout it. For now.

595
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,460
但它四小时后会再次打开
But it'll open again in four hours.

596
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,130
那时我本该和买家见面
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

597
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,090
你知道那武器会造成什么后果吗？
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

598
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,640
帝联已经耗尽了资源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

599
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,850
到处都是饥荒
There's famine.

600
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,520
整个生态系统都在崩溃
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

601
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,940
他们需要找到新的领地
They need to find a new territory

602
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,690
来征服和掠夺
to conquer and strip- mine.

603
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,230
当他们发现超级武器不见了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

604
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,980
他们就会找到那条通道
they're gonna find that passageway- -

605
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,690
你知道他们一定会的
you know they will and they'll come

606
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,320
他们会烧毁一切 奴役幸存者
and they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

607
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,530
陛下 这就是帝国的作风
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

608
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,210
他们都是跟你学的
: They learned well from you.

609
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,460
还有谁想要它
Who else wants it?

610
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,540
我不知道 老兄
I- I don't know, man.

611
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,920
我收到了报价 钱是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

612
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,170
有人从我们这偷走了天赐武器
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

613
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,260
他是谁 不知道
- Who was he? -  No idea.

614
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,640
不管是谁闯入我的房间 偷走了武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

615
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,510
他们之所以知道这些
they know what they know because they learned it

616
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,180
是从你们中的某个人那学来的
from one of you.

617
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,450
紧急传送器
Emergency transporter.

618
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,240
好吧 这很棒
Well, this is great.

619
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,620
哦 更妙了
Oh, even better.

620
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,000
那是…那是飞船吗 飞船不见了吗
Is that...is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

621
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,290
我喜欢那艘船
I liked that ship.

622
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,120
发生什么事了
What hoppened?

623
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,960
破坏行动
Sabotage.

624
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,550
什么
What?

625
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,130
偷走天赐武器的人有个帮手
Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

626
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,630
就在这里
lt was someone here.

627
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,970
这意味着我们中间有个内鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

628
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,770
可能是你 也可能是你
Could be you. Could be you.

629
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,190
如果是我
If it were me,

630
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,440
你们早就都死了
I would have murdered all of you already.

631
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,900
老大 如果有内鬼 你知道不是我
Look, boss, if there's a mole, you know it's not me.

632
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,900
这话听起来就像内鬼会说的
I mean, that sounds pretty moley to me.

633
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,490
我不知道
- I don'tknow.

634
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,240
我们一起执行过十次任务了
We've been on like ten ops together.

635
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,040
是啊 我连你长什么样都不知道
Yeah, andI still don't even know what you look like, do I?

636
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,950
没人知道变形者的本来面目
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

637
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,910
你可以变成任何样子 那弗兹呢
- You might change into anything you want. - What about Fuzz, huh?

638
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,960
他和我们完全不是一个量级的 转移话题了
He exists on a whole other scale than anybody else. - Mm, deflecting?

639
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,420
我老婆快要产下我们的第一窝卵囊了
My wife is about to Iay our first litter of egg sacs.

640
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,590
不 我即将有19万个幼崽 等等等等
No, Ihave190, 000 hatchlings on the way- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,260
我希望它们能活下来 听着
...and I want them to live. Well, look,

642
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,760
你能给我们每个人都找到动机
you could find a motive for any of us.

643
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,510
也可能是我们中任意几个人联手
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

644
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,470
比如说泽夫和弗兹或者…
You know, like- like Zeph and- and Fuzz or...

645
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,060
没有梅勒你就乱了分寸
You are spinning out without Melle.

646
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,730
你无法做出决定
You cannot land on a choice.

647
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,850
也许你说这话是因为你就是内鬼
Maybe you're putting that in my head because you're the mole.

648
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,480
嗯 加勒特怎么样 她是新人
Huh? How obout Garrett? She's new.

649
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,690
她根本不在意我们
She doesn't care obout us.

650
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,190
我是星际舰队的人
I'm Starfleet.

651
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,900
哇 刚才有谁感觉到英雄气息
Whoa. Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

652
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,320
吹动她的斗篷了吗
ruffling her cape?

653
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,620
好吧 那边有艘旧船
Okay, there's an old ship out there,

654
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,950
一艘废弃的运输船
an old garbage scow.

655
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,660
是的 当你在上面
Yeah, Ifound it when you were up there

656
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,240
审问铁头的时候我发现的
interrogating metal head.

657
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,750
虽然多年没人驾驶了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

658
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,120
但我觉得我们可以用它
but I think we can work with it

659
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,830
去追那个偷走天赐武器的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

660
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,290
嗯 我对你的厌恶减轻了
Mm. Idislike you less.

661
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,340
想让人喜欢我 我会养条狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get a dog.

662
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,590
我喜欢秩序
I like order.

663
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,050
我喜欢可预测性和结局
I like prediction and conclusion.

664
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,260
那你找错队伍了 因为我们这有内鬼
Then you're on the wrong team because we've got mole,

665
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,430
被困在一个死寂的星球上
stranded on a dead planet,

666
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,140
无法与外界联系
no communication with the outside,

667
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,020
不到四小时泰伦人就能得到天赐武器
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

668
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,020
他们可以在银河系任何地方使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

669
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,860
说到这个奎斯 天线阵列怎么样
Speaking of which, Quas, what about the antenna array?

670
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,030
呃 这个…
Uh, well

671
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,080
它已经过时二十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

672
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,290
我们得让它运转起来 然后通知31部门即将发生的事
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

673
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,580
我们一起行动
We work together.

674
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,750
所有人都要保持在视线范围内 好的
Everyone stoys in sight. -  Yeah.

675
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,750
就是…
just.

676
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,210
我们走吧
Let's go.

677
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,480
好吧 这个主意泡汤了
Well, there goes that idea.

678
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,820
我们的小内鬼真是忙个不停
Our little mole has been really busy.

679
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,530
把所有线路都破坏了
Ripped up all the wiring.

680
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,400
分两队 我带一队进树林
Two teams. I'll Iead one into the woods.

681
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,780
三个人去看看能否修好那艘破船
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

682
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,070
你和其他人留在这
You stay here with the others

683
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,660
试着修复天线阵列
and try and fix the antenna array.

684
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,910
她凭什么现在给我们下命令
Why is she giving us orders now?

685
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,370
因为我允许她这么做
Because I'm Ietting her

686
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,080
而且我很确定她不是内鬼
and l'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

687
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,790
你不会押注在一匹叫“确定”的马上
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

688
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,840
奎斯 弗兹 你们马上和乔治欧去检查那艘船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

689
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,630
泽夫和加勒特留在这里和我一起
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

690
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,220
我们负责天线阵列
We'll take care of the antenna array.

691
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,130
呃 抱歉
Uh, I'm sorry.

692
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,640
我要和两个想杀我的人
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

693
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,350
一起去树林里
with two people who want to kill me?

694
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,680
保持在彼此视线范围内 别死就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

695
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,100
好吗
Okay?

696
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,850
好的 谢谢队长
Yep, thanks, Cap.

697
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,900
我是说 只有一半概率其中一个想杀我
I mean, just fifty- fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

698
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,230
然后百分之25 奎斯 赶紧滚出去
and then 25%, just get your ass out there.

699
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,480
我也爱你 队长
Ilove you, too, Cop.

700
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,440
好了 遵命
AII righty.  Aye, aye.

701
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,950
这艘破船的内部线路
The internal circuitry on this old scow

702
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,330
状况还算不错
is still in decent shape.

703
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,670
我看到的部件都能用
Everything I'm seeing should work.

704
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,840
所以这个我们在追的东西 天赐武器
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

705
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,970
你们的工程师有没有装保险装置
your engineers, did they install a fail- safe?

706
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,140
我们能远程禁用它吗
Can we disable it remotely?

707
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,390
没有失控保护 我不会允许这种东西
There is no fail- safe. I wouldn't allow it.

708
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,690
这很符合你的风格
How very on- brand for you.

709
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,110
我能再问一个问题吗
Can I ask you one more question?

710
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,280
我就再问最后一个
I'mjust gonna ask you one more question.

711
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,820
你把神赐带到这个世界上
So you brought the Godsend into the world

712
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,030
就为了消灭亿万生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

713
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,910
从没觉得这有点 你懂的 过分吗
Never thought that was a little, you know, much?

714
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,620
我下令销毁了它
I ordered it destroyed.

715
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,790
有人藏起来了 你的人背叛了你
And someone hid it. Your own people betrayed you.

716
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,170
你的企业文化烂透了
Well, your corporate culture was straight- up shit.

717
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,380
而且你还没回答我的问题
And you didn't answer my question.

718
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,880
渐近线线圈不见了
The asymptote coil is gone.

719
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,060
有人一定是为了铽把它拆走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

720
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,100
找另一个这东西应该能飞
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

721
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,600
-货舱里可能有 -不行
Maybe the cargo hull. Huh. Oh, no, no.

722
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,440
所有人要在一起 明白吗
Everyone stays together, all right?

723
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,280
这样你就没机会杀我们了
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

724
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,110
我们去货舱看看
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

725
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,910
你不来吗
Aren't you coming?

726
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,910
来 我可太期待了
Yes. Icouldn't be more excited.

727
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,160
我当然可以帮你
Yeah, Icould help you down there, of course,

728
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,540
但是考虑到你知道 控制欲
but considering how, you know, control

729
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,540
是你性格的核心
is central to your entire identity

730
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,550
而我又不擅长这个
and the fact that I'm just not good atit,

731
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,090
我就站在这里 尊重我们的关系
I'mjust gonna stand here and honor our relationship

732
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,470
-什么都不做 -很有帮助
by doing absolutely nothing.  Helpful.

733
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,180
这叫彻底的自我接纳
It's called radical self- acceptance.

734
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,680
-你很开明嘛 -谢谢
Evolved of you. Well, thank you.

735
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,260
你能修好吗
So, can you fix it?

736
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:49,230
我都不确定它是不是坏了 只是缺了个零件
I'm not even sure it's broken. lt's just missing a part.

737
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,520
你看 这些断裂的线路看着吓人
Look, this- this torn wiring Iooks dramatic,

738
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,440
但这设备有备用系统
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

739
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,940
有简单的替代方案
There's an easy work- around.

740
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,530
但TQ接口被人扯掉了
Except somebody ripped out the the tq junction.

741
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,280
除此之外 这东西应该能用
Other than that, this thing should work.

742
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,410
那也许内鬼拿着它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

743
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,460
-加勒特？ -嗯
Garrett? - Yeah.

744
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,750
泽夫
Zeph.

745
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,790
泽夫在哪
Where is Zeph?

746
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
泽夫 收到请回复
Zeph, come in.

747
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,430
泽夫 听到请回话
Zeph, do you copy?

748
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,940
泽夫
Zeph.

749
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,860
加勒特 是你弄的吗
Garrett, was that you?

750
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,410
加勒特 那是什么声音
Garrett, what the hell was that?

751
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,460
有人启动了天线阵列
Someone just activated the antenno array.

752
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,420
该死
Damn it.

753
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,790
发生什么事了
What's happening?

754
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,300
加勒特 汇报情况
Garrett, sitrep.

755
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,630
这下有好戏看了
This is going to be good.

756
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,590
中尉 收到请回复 完毕
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

757
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,810
安全
Clear.

758
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,400
安全
Clear.

759
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,900
这里没有
Nothing here.

760
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,440
怎么可能有人用这个发送信号
How could someone have used this to send out a signal?

761
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,650
不可能 它缺了个零件
lmpossible. lt's missing a part.

762
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,030
而且被人打坏了
And someone shot it to hell.

763
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
我听到有人在跑
I heard someone running.

764
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,030
泽夫一定是把theta接口装回去了
Zeph must have put the thetq junction back in.

765
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,450
用完天线阵列后又打坏了它
Then shot it after he used the array.

766
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,330
他失踪后一定是绕回来了
So he must hove circled back after he went AWOL.

767
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,670
泽夫来这个星球就是为了破坏我们的行动
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

768
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,550
现在我们被困在这里
And now that we're stranded,

769
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,180
他给他的同伙发了信息
he sent a message to whoever he's working with.

770
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,180
他会躲起来等援军到了
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

771
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,930
然后就跑得无影无踪
and then he's long gone.

772
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,520
那我们得先找到他
Then we need to find him first.

773
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,150
观察手 收到请回复
Observer, do you copy?

774
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,820
突击一号 我什么时候没收到过
Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

775
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,030
有意思 情况如何
That's funny. Status?

776
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,620
这里干扰很大
I'm picking up a lot of interference,

777
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,410
但三录仪显示泽夫的生命特征
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

778
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,700
刚刚出现在这个区域 完毕
was just in this sector. Over.

779
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,750
收到 保持隐蔽 跟紧点
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

780
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,670
你效忠的军阀吉里 她怎么了
The warlord you served, Giri, what happened to her?

781
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
她死得跟活着一样
She died like she lived.

782
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,890
你知道我什么意思
By that, you know what I mean.

783
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,180
她很幸运
She was lucky.

784
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,260
没被良心感染
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

785
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,680
-感染？-对
lnfected? - Yeah.

786
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,930
怪物就该是怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

787
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,190
有悔意的怪物毫无用处
A monster with regrets is useless.

788
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,770
所以你才躲在
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

789
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,610
那个鸟不生蛋的酒吧里
in a bar ot the ass end of nowhere.

790
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,030
也许这就是你为什么要跟31部门合作
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

791
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,780
为了洗清自己
To wipe your slate clean.

792
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,320
像我们这样的人总要付出代价
There's always a price to pay for people like us.

793
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,330
你在这里就说明你也同意
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

794
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,200
原来你是这么看我的
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

795
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,910
你觉得我是个有感情能被控制的怪物
You think I'm a monster who feels enough to be controlled

796
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,750
但还能干脏活
but still do the real dirty work.

797
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,170
不我觉得你想要回神赐是因为你知道
No, I think you want the Godsend back because you know

798
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,790
这是你唯一的机会
it's your one chance to redeem yourself

799
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,420
弥补你的罪过
for all the shit you've done.

800
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,260
我要回神赐是因为它是我的
I want the Godsend bock because it's mine.

801
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,770
啊 泽夫的外骨骼在漏水
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is Ieaking.

802
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,650
对越来越多了
Yep, more.

803
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,160
这边
This way.

804
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,570
布利普 克利普
Blip, Clip,

805
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,480
格利普
Grip,

806
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,820
小儿麻痹 流行感冒
Polio, lnfluensina,

807
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,870
-牛痘… -你在说什么
- Cowpox...- What are you saying?

808
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,780
我在给我的孩子们起名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

809
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,700
既然你们中有人要杀我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

810
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,290
我永远见不到他们了 但至少我可以一一纪念他们
I'm never gonna meet them, but at Ieast I can honor them

811
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,670
每一个
one by one.

812
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,170
崔普
Trip,

813
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,540
崔普2号
Trip 2,

814
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,720
扁桃体炎 克里米亚－刚果出血热…
Tonsilyitis, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

815
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,550
你要把19万个名字都哭诉出来吗
Are you gonna sob out 190, 000 names?

816
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,720
你怎么能这么冷血无情
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

817
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,510
他可能记录下发生的事了吗
Might he have recorded what happened?

818
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,010
当然有
Sure.

819
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,970
但影像可能和他一起消失了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

820
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,020
我们可以把三录仪连接到他的外骨骼上
We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

821
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,610
只要还有数据 就能知道凶手是谁
Whatever data is left, we'll know who did this.

822
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,480
你这是在怀疑我们所有人
You say that like we're all suspects.

823
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,150
我们不是 好吗
We're not. All right?

824
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,700
福兹、我和她当时都在驳船上
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened-

825
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,120
大家都在彼此的视线范围内
everyone in sight of everyone else.

826
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,410
而且没人离开过对吧
And nobody went anywhere, right?

827
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,450
-对 -嗯
Right. -  umm.

828
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,630
这不是泽夫的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

829
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:10,550
黑发25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

830
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,230
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

831
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,770
别乱动
Stop fidgeting.

832
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,400
我和泽夫一起待了一周
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

833
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,110
好吧 你喜欢机械性爱
Okay, so you're into mecha boom- boom.

834
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
很多人类都这样 没什么好羞耻的
Lots of humans are. No shame.

835
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,200
这不可能
Well, that's impossible.

836
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,680
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

837
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,640
为什么你的指甲下有泽夫的血
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

838
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,440
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett,

839
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:14,320
在泽夫身上发现了你的痕迹
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

840
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,320
在你身上也发现了泽夫的痕迹
and evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

841
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,700
一点都不星际舰队
Not very Starfleet.

842
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,450
我非常星际舰队
Oh, Iam very Starfleet.

843
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,040
你知道我没做这事
And you know I didn't do this.

844
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,620
你只是害怕任何有道德准则的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

845
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,840
在那颗纯洁的心底
And deep down in that pure little heart,

846
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,920
你其实是个混乱小妖精 对吧
you're actuallya chaos goblin, aren't you?

847
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,470
-我知道你有这潜质 天使 -别这么叫我
- I know you have itin you, angel. - Don't call me that.

848
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,090
星际舰队看出了你的本质
Starfleet sniffed you out

849
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,970
把你安排在最有用的位置
and put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

850
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,390
31区正是那些懂得变通规则的军官该去的地方
Section 31 is just the place for officers who bend the rules,

851
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,650
从不违规 直到他们违规的那一刻
never quite break them until they do.

852
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,480
你在这里很合适
And you fit right in here.

853
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,990
你随便折磨我
You can torture me all you want.

854
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,700
你永远不能把我变成杀人凶手
You will never make me o murderer.

855
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,910
不
No.

856
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,640
找到录像了！
We've got footage!

857
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,020
住手！
Stop!

858
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,850
住手！
Stop!

859
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,190
这是我的外骨骼
This is my suit.

860
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,520
我就是外骨骼！
I am the suit!

861
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,990
外骨骼就是我！
The suit is me!

862
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,530
等一下
One second.

863
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,660
我们是朋友啊 我们是朋友
We were your friends. We were your friends.

864
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,460
你不能杀我
You can't kill me. -

865
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,670
-泽夫 不要 -你不能杀…
Zeph, no. You can't kill...

866
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,220
泽夫是自杀的？
Zeph killed himself?

867
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,840
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

868
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,260
抱歉让你失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

869
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,520
这一切都说不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

870
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,940
对 一点都说不通
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

871
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,600
他为什么要这么做 呃...
Why would he do this? Uh.

872
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,560
-给我几分钟... -我们没时间了
Give me a couple minutes to......- We don't have minutes.

873
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,900
那给我几秒钟
Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

874
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,240
-可能是你 -可能是你
Could be you.  Could be you.

875
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,820
我甚至还不知道你长什么样
And I still don't even know what you look like.

876
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,570
你可以变成任何样子
You could change into anything you want.

877
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,160
她是新来的她不在乎我们
She's new. She doesn't care about us.

878
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,870
-我是星际舰队的 -哇
I'm Starfleet. - Whoa.

879
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,250
说到外骨骼
When you are talking about the suit,

880
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,080
就是在说泽夫
you're talking about Zeph.

881
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,080
这不是福兹
This isn't Fuzz.

882
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,000
瓦肯人只是个机器 你知道的
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

883
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,540
我在里面
I'm inside.

884
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,130
歧视鳞片的人！
Scale- shamer!

885
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,760
你想不到我能钻进多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

886
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,890
比如 身体改造的内部构造
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

887
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,390
有个自动驾驶
There's an autopilot.

888
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,970
这是唯一合理的解释
That's the only thing that makes sense.

889
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,980
你把瓦肯机器设成了自动驾驶
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

890
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,190
难怪它的反应那么奇怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

891
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,160
-你不来吗 -来了
Aren't you coming? - Yes.

892
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,200
你钻进了泽夫的外骨骼
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

893
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,120
一旦进去之后…
And once you were inside...

894
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,250
有人拆掉了西塔接头
Somebody ripped out the theta junction.

895
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,210
加勒特 泽夫在哪
Garrett, where's Zeph?

896
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,670
然后你控制了泽夫的外骨骼
Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

897
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,880
当其他人出去找他的时候
While the others were out Iooking for him,

898
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,590
你让他偷偷回到天线阵列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

899
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,050
发送了那些信息
and send those messages.

900
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,100
别对他们下手！
Don't do this to them!

901
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,470
我们曾是朋友啊
We were your friends.

902
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,100
然后你就毁掉了证据
Then you destroyed the evidence.

903
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,650
还杀了泽夫
And you killed Zeph.

904
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,650
然后把证据栽赃给了加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

905
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,490
举起手来 费兹
Hands up, Fuzz.

906
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,870
真是见了鬼了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

907
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,670
你真要相信她说的话吗 阿洛克？
Whoa. You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

908
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,590
奎斯 想想我们共同经历的一切
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

909
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,380
我…我能先说一句话吗？
C- Can Ijust say one thing first?

910
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,270
我还能控制泽夫的机甲
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

911
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,570
快点！
Come on!

912
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,080
“绝不抛弃任何船员”呢？
What happened to"no crew member Ieft behind"?

913
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,890
快点 快点！
Come on, come on!

914
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,100
靠近点
Get us closer.

915
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,960
我接住你了 我接住你了
Igot you. Igot you.

916
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,720
该死
Nice and easy.  Damn.

917
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,570
你一直在关注黑市对吧？
You keep tabs on the black market, umm?

918
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,490
在那里听说了上天之眼
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

919
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,860
你在意这个干什么？
Why do you care?

920
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,740
你杀了自己的家人
You killed your family.

921
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,540
再多几十亿人又算什么？
What's a few billion more people, huh?

922
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,410
它在哪里？你在和谁合作？
Where is it? And who are you working with?

923
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,290
你就在他们身边十步之遥
You took your crown while they died in agony

924
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,420
看着他们痛苦死去时夺取了王冠
not ten feet away.

925
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,380
你把唯一的朋友变成了奴隶
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

926
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,180
最后还厚颜无耻地对他施以仁慈？
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

927
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,260
你怎么会知道这些？
How could you know that?

928
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,060
终于明白了吧
Glad you're catching on.

929
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,020
他骗了你 陛下
He played you, Emperor.

930
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,060
桑还活着
San's alive.

931
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,190
这不可能
lt's not possible.

932
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,780
这怎么可能？
That's not possible. How?

933
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,450
他一点点服用那种毒药
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

934
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,740
慢慢建立起了抗体
Teeny tiny doses over time.

935
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,370
小人物又赢了一局 陛下
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

936
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,290
他在哪里？！
Where is he? !

937
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,960
他会给你上一场好戏
He's gonna put on quite the show.

938
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,090
你制造了上天之眼
You built the Godsend.

939
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,970
这个怪物是你一手造就
You made this monster.

940
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,220
这都是你的错
This is all you.

941
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,770
小心点 知道吗？
Be careful, all right?

942
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,390
我说了小心点
I said be careful.

943
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,480
我还要靠这个活动呢
I have to get around in that.

944
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,360
你现在能买上百个这样的了
You can afford a hundred of them now.

945
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,690
哦 太好了
Oh, great.

946
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,860
我只要一个能用的就行
I'd settle for one that works.

947
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,620
所以就是这个？
So that's it?

948
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,240
至高无上的上天之眼
The almighty Godsend.

949
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,620
等你当上皇帝后
When you're emperor,

950
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,330
最好给它换个不那么让人困惑的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

951
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,140
一旦通道打开
Once that passageway opens up,

952
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,770
他就联系地球人 他们就会过来
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

953
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,310
他们会在这里引爆它
They're detonating it here.

954
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,190
他就成了帝国的宠儿
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

955
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,070
他会把联邦搞得一团混乱…
So he throws the Federotion into chaos.

956
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,200
星际舰队会手忙脚乱
Starfleet will start scrambling.

957
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,990
正是入侵的好时机
Perfect time to invode.

958
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,580
你创造了这个东西
You gave birth to this thing.

959
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,710
我们做不到
- How do we stop it? -  We don't.

960
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:13,210
我们被困在这里 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

961
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,540
天线被毁了 警告不了任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

962
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,050
这都是借囗
That is bullshit.

963
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,050
我做不到
You can do better than that. - l can't.

964
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,340
上天之眼就是我
The Godsend is me.

965
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,640
我永远都战胜不了自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

966
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,390
过去总会追上你
The past always catches up with you.

967
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,770
对吧？
Right?

968
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,770
但不代表它总能赢
Doesn't mean it always wins.

969
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,900
每个安全屋我都有后备计划
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

970
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,530
我们能让那艘垃圾船启动
We'll get that scow running.

971
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,870
老大 那垃圾船飞不起来
Boss, the scow won't fly.

972
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,740
没有渐近线线圈不行
Not without an asymptote coil.

973
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,210
我们有一个
We have one.

974
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,120
我们能追上桑
We'll catch up with San.

975
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,540
确保他联系不上地球人
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

976
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,090
你拆了线圈
You ripped out the coil.

977
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,590
有内鬼在时不能告诉你们
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

978
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,430
混蛋
Asshole.

979
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,480
好了 奎斯 启动它
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

980
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,660
还是只有一个脉冲
Stil just one pulse.

981
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,460
搞定了
And we're in business.

982
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,580
好了团队 我们只剩不到30分钟了
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

983
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,210
奎斯 设定航向新月星云
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

984
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,420
这会很颠簸 很危险
AII right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

985
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,340
我猜桑的船上有武器吧
I'm assuming San's ship will be armed.

986
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:47,180
是啊 地球人的船都有武器
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

987
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,550
他有质子炮 鱼雷
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

988
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,680
而我们只是艘垃圾船
and we are a garbage barge.

989
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,230
你笑什么？
Why are you laughing?

990
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:56,270
因为情况不会更糟了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

991
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,400
我们走
Let's go.

992
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,080
这东西在牵引光束中间飞行
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

993
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,000
人们把垃圾丢进太空
People jettison their garbage into space,

994
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,920
垃圾船就在牵引光束里飞行
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

995
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,170
收集这些垃圾
along with the field.

996
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,130
一旦牵引光束装满了
Once the tractor field is full,

997
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,880
就把垃圾倒进星云
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

998
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,720
让辐射把它们分解掉
where it disintegrates in the rodiation.

999
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,640
我就说明这么多
I just want to be clear.

1000
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,510
你是说我们最好的武器就是
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1001
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,350
一个收集垃圾的光束？
a beam for collecting garbage?

1002
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,730
-对 -太好了
Yes. Great.

1003
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,560
嘿抱怨可解决不了问题
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1004
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,360
-你去哪？-工程部
Where are you going? - Engineering.

1005
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,900
既然这是我们唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1006
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,900
我要把所有能量都转到牵引光束上
I'II redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1007
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,030
这主意还不错
That's actually a good plan.

1008
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,380
我们就位了
We're in position.

1009
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,470
通道马上就会打开
The passagewoy will open soon.

1010
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,310
你知道这一切结束后我想要什么吗？
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1011
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,680
就是一个大空间
Just a big space, you know,

1012
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,480
让我的幼虫能随意打洞和飞翔
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and.

1013
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,560
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1014
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,530
我要乔治欧在失败中煎熬
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1015
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,740
我知道你们是”永世宿敌
I get you guys are all"eternal nemesis,

1016
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,570
性感又邪恶的纠葛”之类的 但是…
sexy evil tension"and stuff, but...

1017
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,990
警报
Alert.

1018
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,410
发现来袭舰船
lncoming vessel.

1019
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,330
检测到碰撞轨道
Collision trajectory detected.

1020
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,620
果然她把船弄起来了
Of course she got it off the ground.

1021
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,000
我说我们该用鱼雷
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1022
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,260
他们发现我们了
They've picked us up.

1023
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,220
光子鱼雷来袭
Photon torpedo incoming.

1024
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,550
-还有五秒四… -现在真该躲开！
Impact in five, fourReally want to take evqsive action right now!

1025
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,100
-三 二 一 -夸西保持航向 全力防护罩
...three, two, one. Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1026
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,400
她为什么不改变航向？
Why isn't she changing course?

1027
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,020
我又不是算命的
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1028
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,150
牵引光束的能量够用了吗？
Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1029
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,990
够了 但我们承受不住再一次直接命中
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1030
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:14,830
鱼雷来袭 五 四…
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1031
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:18,120
-稳住 马上就到了…… -三 二 一
Keep it steady. We're almost there...three, two, one.

1032
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,830
就是现在
Now.

1033
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,380
警报 导航控制暂停
Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1034
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,140
他们想干嘛 把我们拖垮？
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1035
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,640
她想阻止我回到帝国
She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1036
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,190
大家觉得这情况如何？
How's everybody feeling about this?

1037
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,400
这是唯一的办法
It's the only way.

1038
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,650
这能成功
This can work.

1039
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,530
辐射会削弱他们的防护罩
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1040
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:53,530
是啊 问题是辐射也会影响到我们
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1041
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,240
目标锁定故障
Target lock malfunction.

1042
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,000
无法锁定鱼雷 炮塔离线
Ican't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1043
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,500
桑？
San?

1044
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,750
桑
San.

1045
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,540
桑！
San!

1046
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,010
辐射水平已达临界值
Radiation levels critical.

1047
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,220
防护罩已失效 重复 防护罩已失效！
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1048
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,850
桑的呢？
And San's?

1049
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,690
他的只剩12% 而且还在快速下降
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1050
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,980
等离子体来袭！
Plasma incoming!

1051
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,440
要是挨上这样一下
We get caught with a burst like that,

1052
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,690
我们就完了
and we're done.

1053
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,030
这太混乱了 加勒特
This is chaos, Garrett.

1054
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,530
你知道你喜欢这样 嗯？
You know you love it, umm?

1055
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,410
也许该接受它 跟它亲热一下
Mqybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1056
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,450
这就是星际舰队派你来这的原因
lt's why Starfleet put you here.

1057
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,290
混乱就是我的炮友
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1058
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:45,540
对 加勒特 让我们玩个痛快
Yeah, Garrett, let's get messy.

1059
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,500
-嗯？ -好啊
umm? - Okay.

1060
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,250
-交给你了 夸西 -嗯
You got this, Quas. Uh- huh.

1061
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,550
准备好了吗？
You ready?

1062
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,090
桑的防护罩只剩4%了
San's shields are at four percent.

1063
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,880
现在是2%
Two now.

1064
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,760
他的防护罩失效了
His shields are down.

1065
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:59,220
可以行动了
Good to go.

1066
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,800
菲利帕！
Philippa!

1067
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,770
这场较量只有
This contest only ends

1068
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:50,060
一方死去才会结束！
when one of us is dead!

1069
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,200
开始引爆程序
Detonation sequence activating.

1070
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,580
你看 我们纳米人不需要联邦
See, the Nanokins, we don't need the Federation.

1071
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,910
从来都不需要
We never have.

1072
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,460
在你们这些巨兽发现我们之前 我们就是统治者
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1073
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,330
等你们消失后 我们还会继续统治
and we will rule again after you're gone.

1074
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,470
猜猜谁能在大爆炸中存活？
Guess who survives very Iarge explosions.

1075
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,970
非常小的生物
Very small things.

1076
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,060
现在失陪了 我要去切断我们的船
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to cut our ship loose.

1077
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,270
抱歉如果你的朋友因此丧命
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1078
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:32,110
不 我开玩笑的
No, I'm joking.

1079
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,520
我等不及要杀了他们
I can't wait to kill them.

1080
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,400
再见了 你们这些大块头的废物！
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1081
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,210
谁在驾驶那艘船？
Who's flying that?

1082
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,050
呃 根据传感器显示 只有一个微小的生命体
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life- form on board,

1083
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,880
而且正朝我们飞来
and it's heading right for us.

1084
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,470
锁定导弹
Plot missile lock.

1085
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
我们只有垃圾 对 就只有垃圾
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1086
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:27,870
只剩一个
But one.

1087
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,080
桑
San.

1088
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
等待生物特征信号确认
Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1089
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,590
我锁定了法兹的穿梭机
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1090
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,090
他正返回桑的船上
He's heading back to San's ship.

1091
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,510
-我们勉强跟上了 -别跟丢他
We're barely keeping up. - Stay on him.

1092
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,260
呃 我们没有任何武器
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1093
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:49,890
我们有一船舱的垃圾
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1094
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,230
别让那艘穿梭机跑了
Do not lose that shuttle.

1095
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:52,690
好的
Okay.

1096
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,190
我什么都不是
I was nothing!

1097
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,030
那个男孩软弱无能
That boy was soft, weak.

1098
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:07,120
但在你的压迫下 这些年让我成长到今天
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1099
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,120
帝国军即将通过传送门
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1100
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,290
我的帝国
My Empire!

1101
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,500
我们将以仁慈统治这个宇宙
And we will reign over this universe

1102
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,290
不像你那样残暴
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1103
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,920
没有仁慈的独裁者 圣
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1104
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,520
这是你教会我的
You taught me that.

1105
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,810
我们还能挽回
We can come back from this.

1106
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,650
重新开始
We can start over.

1107
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,620
我爱混乱
Oh, I love chaos.

1108
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,290
混乱才是我的菜
Chaos is my jam.

1109
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,380
我爱混乱 我爱混乱
I love chaos. I love chaos.

1110
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,960
加勒特 你在下面干什么
Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1111
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,760
夸西 我可是受过训练的星际舰队军官
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1112
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,970
我要活到当上舰长的那天
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1113
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,640
你得相信我 好吗
You got to trust me, okay?

1114
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,970
你好啊
Hi there.

1115
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,680
真高兴你找到我
I'm so glad you found me.

1116
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,020
你刚说什么
What'd you just say?

1117
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,270
这是个玩具
lt's atoy.

1118
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,150
看起来像是来自德罗姆星球的
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1119
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,610
我们一起玩点有趣的吧
Shall we do something fun together?

1120
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,690
哇 哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1121
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,780
你还好吧 星际舰队
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1122
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,740
来吧 来吧 好
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1123
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:35,830
我们不让德罗姆科技进入联邦
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1124
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,580
因为他们用特伦矿作为能源
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1125
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,790
你是要炸死我们对吧
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1126
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,050
最好祈祷这艘船的船体
You better hope that this ship's hull

1127
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,050
是用托莫海特加固的
is reinforced with Tomohite.

1128
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,240
我是个科学官
I am a science officer.

1129
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,000
科学就是可控的混乱
And science is just controlled chaos.

1130
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,670
混乱 混乱
Whoa, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos!

1131
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,430
啊 快点
Ah, come on.

1132
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,930
起来 你这笨机器人
Get up, you stupid robot.

1133
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,250
不 不
No. No.

1134
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,710
不
No!

1135
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,630
待在费兹的船前面 这样我们就能打开货舱
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship so we can open the payload bay.

1136
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,590
呃 对
Uh, yeah.

1137
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,430
关于这个
About that.

1138
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,050
夸西 马上就要发生巨大爆炸了
Uh, thing is...Quasi, there's about to be a very large explosion.

1139
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,140
这控制台用的是我不认识的语言
This console's in a language I don't know.

1140
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,560
我能破译一些
I can decipher some of it.

1141
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,970
我只需要把它分解成词素
I just have to break it down to morphemes

1142
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,640
然后你知道的…巨大爆炸即将发生
and, you know...Large explosion impending.

1143
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,310
这两个按钮任一个都可能打开货舱
Either of these two buttons could open the cargo bay.

1144
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,600
那就两个都按
Okay, so push them both.

1145
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,810
这两个按钮任一个也可能
Either of these two buttons could also

1146
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,150
启动自毁程序
initiate a self- destruct protocol.

1147
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,440
反正我们都要爆炸了
- We're gonna blow up anyway. - Uh- huh.

1148
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,820
夸西 夸西 看着我
- Um, uh. Huh? - Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

1149
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,660
你只需要做个决定
You just need to make o call.

1150
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,120
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

1151
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,740
好吧 好
Okoy. Okay.

1152
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,840
我们可以永远做朋友
We can be friends forever...

1153
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:37,050
想听个有趣的事吗
Do you want to hear something funny?

1154
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,970
我在自动驾驶
I'm on autopilot.

1155
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,070
见鬼了
What the hell?

1156
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,900
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1157
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:54,650
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1158
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,080

如果能回到过去
If you could go back,

1193
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,270
当你跪在吉里面前时
and you were kneeling in front of Giri,

1194
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,110
你会杀了她吗

1196

还行 不算太糟

他们给了我一个提议
They made me an offer.

1233
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:51,650
然后呢
And?

1234

我还在考虑

你呢
You?

你以为这样能瞒我
And how long did you think

1237
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:04,920
多久呢 嗯
you could fool me with this, umm?

1238
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:08,170
-什么露馅了 -嗯

你看着我时还是会紧张
You still get nervous when I look at you.

1240
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,680
呵 你好 船长

那你们肯定需要监管

1251
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:37,370
我随时可能把你们都杀了
