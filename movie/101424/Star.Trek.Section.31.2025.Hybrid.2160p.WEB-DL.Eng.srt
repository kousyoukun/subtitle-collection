1
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,680
She's back! She's home!

2
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,220
Philippa came home!

3
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,100
Two years,

4
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,150
and everything looks exactly as I remember.

5
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,150
I never thought I would see this place again.

6
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,530
There were 18 of us this time.

7
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,370
Culled from every corner of the Empire

8
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,120
and brought to Terra for the contest.

9
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,630
We were told that only one of us would survive

10
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,880
the years to come.

11
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,130
One child.

12
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,890
...the purest expression of the Terran identity.

13
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,020
They pitted us against each other.

14
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,230
And month by month, our numbers dwindled.

15
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,360
Did...did you win?

16
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,740
ls it over?

17
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,950
Two of us still live.

18
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,580
San and me.

19
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,880
Me and San.

20
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,880
We are two...

21
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,470
...but one.

22
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,510
Forever.

23
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,230
The word "friend" was forbidden during the contest,

24
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,610
but we whispered it to each other when no one could hear.

25
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,860
San and I combined our skills

26
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,450
against the proctor and the other contestants.

27
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,120
But only one of you could be emperor.

28
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
One task remains.

29
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,920
The first to complete it rules the Empire,

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,750
and the other spends the rest of their life

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,920
in servitude to the new emperor.

32
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,210
What do you have to do?

33
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,060
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,070
What did you do? !

35
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,070
No ties to the old life are permitted.

36
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,660
An emperor can only be loyal to duty.

37
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,910
"Thus does the Empire remain strong.

38
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,370
Thus does it grow. "

39
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,550
Mom. Philippa.

40
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,760
You succeeded where your competitor could not.

41
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,850
Bring him here.

42
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,900
San did not have the strength to pass the final test.

43
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,490
Even now, his village burns as a testament to his cowardice.

44
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,580
I love you.

45
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,580
You have won the contest.

46
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,080
Claim your victory.

47
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,270
San, step forward.

48
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,820
You live now only to serve at her heel.

49
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,370
Kneel before the one who owns your life.

50
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,600
We are two...

51
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,140
But one.

52
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,600
Not anymore.

53
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,010
AII hail Philippa Georgiou!

54
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,800
AlI hail the emperor!

55
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,350
Hail! Hail! Hail!

56
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,640
Hail!

57
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,570
This is Control

58
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,530
with a priority message for Alpha Team Leader.

59
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,960
Your subject is Emperor Philippa Georgiou,

60
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,620
former ruler of the Terran Empire.

61
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,380
lt's in a parallel universe

62
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,800
with the most criminal population

63
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,170
in recorded history.

64
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,680
Even there, Georgiou had the market cornered on atrocities.

65
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,310
ln 2257, she was brought to our universe

66
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,100
and joined Section 31,

67
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,020
but after a few years, we lost contact.

68
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,980
Recently, Georgiou was spotted using an alias

69
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,450
in the border territory outside Federation space,

70
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,530
where we're tracking a new threat on the black market.

71
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,790
This is where your team comes in.

72
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,750
Federation treaty forbids us from crossing over that border,

73
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,290
which means Starfleet cannot get its hands dirty.

74
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,840
You and your 31 team will go in, make contact with Georgiou

75
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,180
to help identify and neutralize the threat.

76
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,970
But make no mistqke...

77
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,970
this dog bites, so watch your backs.

78
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,480
You have 24 hours to complete the mission.

79
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,520
Get to work.

80
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,830
Madame du Franc?

81
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,210
Small incident in the honeymoon suite.

82
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm afraid the bride molted

83
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,630
just as things were coming to a climax.

84
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,300
Virgil, get to the point. -

85
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,930
I sent a biohazard team and your condolences.

86
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,850
Also, there's a customer hoping for a word with you.

87
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,520
He seems entirely sober but quite intoxicating.

88
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,570
Mqdame Veronique du Franc will see you.

89
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,830
Alok Sahar, Madame Veronique du Franc.

90
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,080
Madame du Franc normally does business by appointment.

91
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,670
I'd like to make an oppointment.

92
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,260
Oh, the gentleman would like to make an appointment.

93
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,510
Now. Now, madam.

94
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,880
Impossible.Impossible.

95
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,570
Au revoir, Virgil.

96
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,040
That is illegal.

97
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,630
And that makes money.

98
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,880
This is a reputable establishment.

99
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,420
Not what I heard.

100
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,800
- Why don't we discuss it in your office? - umm.

101
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,970
Why would I take you to my office, Alok Sahar?

102
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,930
Because it's a hands- on experience.

103
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,750
Dulcet thistle.

104
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,660
Dulcet thistle's extinct.

105
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,420
I've got a dozen keys of this stuff.

106
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,090
Have you partaken?

107
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,300
This would be one of my few first times.

108
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,380
Packs a punch.

109
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,300
- Ahappy punch. Mmm.

110
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,650
Bottoms up.

111
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,400
- To money. To you.

112
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,630
Now, let's cut the shit.

113
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,630
What is Section 31 doing in my space station?

114
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,050
umm? You think I don't know an agent when I see one?

115
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
You're heading up a team of six operatives,

116
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,470
and they're dll over the bar.

117
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
There's the Chameloid,

118
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,230
a green- blooded shape- shifter,

119
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,190
trying to muster sexy time with a Deltan,

120
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,900
a walking honey trap

121
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,150
31's obviously using as a distraction.

122
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,120
Except Chameloids are the only species in the galaxy

123
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,740
immune to Deltan sexy time charm.

124
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,330
Then there's the guy with all the high- end mech,

125
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,460
standing in the back, looking like he has thoughts.

126
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Mech life, it ain't just about the brute force.

127
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,180
I'mgonna say heavy on artillery, low on IQ.

128
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,220
I'm so sorry.

129
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,680
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

130
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,350
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

131
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,270
And since Vulcans never laugh, he's either an idiot, too,

132
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,820
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

133
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,660
Oh, come on. That was funny.

134
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,450
And the very serious human you stuck him with.

135
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,200
Reel it in anytime.

136
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,540
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

137
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
it's coming out her mouth.

138
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,080
Just reel it in.

139
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,090
That would be

140
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,180
Lieutenant Garrett.

141
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,090
Starfleet.

142
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,760
Where fun goes to die.

143
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,890
It took you long enough to find me.

144
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,020
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

145
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,320
would be valuable to us one day.

146
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,940
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

147
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,910
to anyone but myself.

148
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,920
So, is this where we start negotiating?

149
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,210
umm, that depends.

150
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,380
How long have you known about me?

151
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,130
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

152
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,840
who we still haven't found.

153
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,180
Well, all of.

154
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,310
That wasn't me. Emperor Georgiou,

155
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,810
I am authorized to arrest you

156
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,810
and wipe your mind clean. -

157
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,270
But then again, there's a part of me

158
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,690
that wants you to live with your memories.

159
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,280
The genocidal ones.

160
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,110
Being authorized to arrest me

161
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,370
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

162
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,120
You really want Section 31 want me- -

163
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,960
dogging you until the end of time?

164
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,370
Boring.

165
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,710
The past always catches up with you.

166
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,880
And as much as both of us

167
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,130
might hate it, I'm doing you a favor.

168
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,510
One lqst mission.

169
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,640
Listen.

170
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,640
Do you believe in fate?

171
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,350
Becouse I do.

172
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,690
You can't hide from it.

173
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,060
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

174
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm giving you a chance to get back in.

175
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
In on the action on a galactic scale.

176
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,700
Stop running from it.

177
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,080
Be who you are.

178
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,380
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

179
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,510
Let's get on with it.

180
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,690
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.

181
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,530
This is Melle.

182
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,030
Zeph.

183
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

184
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,200
Uh, hold on.

185
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,870
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

186
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,120
just stand here and get insulted.

187
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,580
I'm not talking about you.

188
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,540
I'm talking about your suit.

189
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,550
Um, you're new,

190
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,590
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

191
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,470
that when you are talking about the suit,

192
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,970
you're talking about Zeph.

193
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,220
- Oh.  Zeph suffers from

194
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,890
what we call mecha dysmorphia.

195
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,890
And I may not know what that is,

196
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,310
but I'm also not gonna take that

197
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,980
from you, Quas, and personally I'm offended.

198
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,480
- I think you should know...- Well, it's accurate.

199
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,650
It's not a diagnosis. You're not a doctor.

200
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,070
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

201
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,400
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

202
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
He knows.

203
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,780
He gets it. He gets it. Yes.

204
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,320
Okay, what obout that Vulcan?

205
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,780
Nobody told her?

206
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,790
This? The thing you're talking to?

207
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,950
The Vulcan's just a machine.

208
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,910
I'm inside.

209
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
Driving.

210
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,140
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

211
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,010
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

212
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,180
Hi there.

213
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,230
I'm Fuzz.

214
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,850
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

215
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,360
Real fun- loving guy.

216
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,730
Hello.

217
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,940
Except for when he's not.

218
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,690
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

219
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,150
Well, you could've stopped at the first thing, Quasi.

220
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,490
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

221
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,250
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

222
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,960
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

223
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,920
31 made first contact when

224
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,880
we discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

225
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,880
Quasi. Oh, shit.

226
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,300
Say"infestation"one more time, Quasi.

227
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,380
Soy"scavenger, "you sack of amorphous soot!

228
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,180
l- ls- - I heard it as soon as I said it.

229
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,550
I will kick your ass

230
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

231
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,470
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

232
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,140
I am locked down.

233
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm trapped inside a giant robot Vulcan head.

234
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,820
No one is more locked down than me right now!

235
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,490
Nanokins have o wonky emotional spectrum.

236
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,490
No, no, no, no, no, no, Iwillnot

237
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,780
be condescended to, Melle,

238
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,450
particularly not by you, because honest.

239
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,540
Ilove you. You are everything.

240
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,250
Does my spectrum work for you? -  Fuzz.

241
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,750
- Imean, like, like, are you into it or...- Fuzz!

242
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,790
Fuzz!

243
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,300
She's insulting you, pal.

244
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,010
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

245
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,220
but have a little self- respect, would you?

246
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,510
Can we continue?

247
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,220
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Gorrett.

248
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,680
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

249
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,560
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

250
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,980
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

251
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,360
Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

252
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,360
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

253
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,900
And you? - One moment.

254
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,320
Quasi came on my radar

255
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,870
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

256
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,660
Glioclusters are theoretical.

257
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,290
Formerly theoretical.

258
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,960
Life is just branching possibilities.

259
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,130
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

260
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,250
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

261
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,300
I mean, after all, you've murdered

262
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,800
so many people.

263
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,970
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

264
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,640
I could respond to that

265
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,100
or I could observe my feelings right now,

266
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,680
lock it away and do what I need to do.

267
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,480
- Or...- Quas. Pick one. umm?

268
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,230
Yes. Sometimes Quasi sees

269
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,150
so many options he gets brain- freeze. - Thank you, Melle.

270
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,240
- Quasi, can we carryon, please?

271
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,280
Our target's name is Dqda Noe.

272
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,990
Dubious moral compass.

273
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,740
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

274
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,250
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

275
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,960
Noe's on his way to the Baraam to sell his latest creation

276
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,630
to the Minosian High Council.

277
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,630
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

278
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,420
but that could change if they get their hands

279
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,880
on a superweapon.

280
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,760
Dowe know what this bio superweapon is?

281
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,850
No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

282
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,470
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

283
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,850
How?

284
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,310
Things went south when you spotted us,

285
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
but the plan is still solid.

286
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,780
First, Alok was going to...

287
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,650
You can soy it.

288
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,990
Connect.

289
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
With you.

290
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,990
Welcome! Yes.

291
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,830
What o cute idea.

292
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,210
Once we had you suitably distracted,

293
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,300
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

294
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,460
Okay, Quasi.

295
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,260
If you would do the honors. Absolutely.

296
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,310
Let's get to work.

297
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Welcome, Dada Noe.

298
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,570
This is where Fuzz comes in.

299
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,750
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

300
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,250
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

301
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,750
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

302
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
well, then it's time to get to work.

303
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,210
So many circuits.

304
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,930
So many things that could go wrong.

305
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,840
Competency crusader here will talk me through

306
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,300
the tech on the implant.

307
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,470
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

308
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,890
by tinkering with that implant,

309
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,440
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

310
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,100
on this whole operotion.

311
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,310
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

312
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,320
to any third- rate terrorist with a Lotinum card.

313
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,150
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

314
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,110
Starfleet does not do assassinotions.

315
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,780
Ay, don't get your prime directives in a bunch.

316
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,120
You are not going to get your hands dirty

317
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
and mess up your chances of becoming captain.

318
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,790
I'm atop- tier science officer.

319
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,870
Butt pretzel. - : Tight- ass.

320
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,750
So disrespectful.

321
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link.

322
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,010
...he'll be under our control, and I'll take him down

323
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,430
with the help of Zeph.

324
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,100
That's what I callahit. - One.

325
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,230
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

326
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,060
before the buyers cqn even show up to the Baraam.

327
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,320
And we are in nd out.

328
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,940
Mm. Meh.

329
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Meh?

330
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,450
I have o simpler idea.

331
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,010
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

332
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,800
We're honored to have you here at the Bqraam.

333
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,680
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

334
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
I told them to have my suite ready.

335
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,890
Mais oui, monsieur.

336
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,230
May lescort you to your quarters?

337
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,690
Come.

338
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,020
We have the most exquisite

339
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,610
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

340
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,110
Well, Lieutenant,

341
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,400
you got to do what you got to do,

342
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,530
and l'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

343
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,870
I said don't bring me.

344
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,370
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

345
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,660
Well, your people made everything easy.

346
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,290
Our pleasure. Here we are.

347
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,970
So tacky.

348
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,720
But I guess that's what you're known for.

349
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,020
What's this?

350
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,390
It's called a phase pod.

351
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,020
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

352
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,440
and I got one for myself, too.

353
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,700
What are you doing?

354
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,370
Everything in the universe vibrates

355
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
- on acertain wavelength. -

356
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,370
Damn it.

357
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,880
Give me back my case.

358
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,380
No.

359
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,470
That's coming out of your security deposit.

360
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,390
The phase pod changes the wavelength

361
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,050
of whatever they touch.

362
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,310
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

363
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,520
Iam, however, in phase with your case.

364
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,230
And I will be taking it with me.

365
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,110
You have no idea what you've started.

366
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,990
Whoops

367
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,870
lmpressive.

368
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,460
Are you sure you're human?

369
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Most days.

370
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,250
Thank you.

371
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,000
Give me the case.

372
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,360
Who are you?

373
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,290
He went that way. That way, that woy, that way, that way!

374
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,850
Oh, aliens.

375
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,430
- Naked aliens. -  Go, Zeph, go.

376
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,700
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

377
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,460
: Melle, he's coming to you.

378
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,210
Yikes.

379
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,970
No, it's okoy.

380
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,560
- l'm all right. - Melle, you got him?

381
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,720
Got him.

382
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,890
Ooh- la- la!

383
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,600
Ay, amor.

384
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,360
That's not possible.

385
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,900
I had that destroyed.

386
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,160
No. No!

387
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,660
lt's not possible.

388
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,200
You knew that weapon.

389
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,250
What is it?

390
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,750
What is it?

391
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,590
Fine. The hard way.

392
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,420
The Eternal Supplicant begs opproach.

393
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,790
You have my permission.

394
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,590
AlI hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

395
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,930
Mother of the Fatherland,

396
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,100
Overlord of Vulc- What is it?

397
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,100
lt is finished, Your Majesty.

398
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,810
Where are my engineers?

399
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:13,690
: They...they took their own lives upon completion.

400
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,330
Who is the tear for, San?

401
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,290
Speak.

402
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,500
lt is for you, Majesty.

403
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,550
lt is oll

404
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,340
for you.

405
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,020
I asked you a question, San.

406
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,480
Why do you cry for me?

407
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,820
Look ot me.

408
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,490
Do you remember who we were?

409
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,660
Before oll this.

410
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,580
The curious boy.

411
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,380
The innocent girl.

412
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,590
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

413
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,680
Don't lie to me.

414
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,430
We were the only ones who could understand

415
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,930
the cost to stay alive.

416
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,690
We made o team.

417
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,190
We needed each other, didn't we?

418
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,110
What did we say to carry each other through,

419
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,320
to survive together?

420
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,160
We are two.

421
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,580
But one.

422
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,200
We are two but one.

423
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,370
If I said then,

424
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,870
"Let's run away,

425
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,420
"let's flee this competition

426
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,670
and everything that binds us to Terra, "

427
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,050
what would you have said?

428
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,430
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

429
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,770
I would have said yes.

430
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,070
Then.

431
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,820
But now?

432
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:29,250
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

433
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,960
lnstead, you chose to build this.

434
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,000
That means that innocent girl I knew,

435
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,590
she hqs been...

436
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,470
: ...murdered.

437
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,640
What is this?

438
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,550
You......

439
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,390
You took the same poison?

440
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,560
No! I forbid you to die!

441
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,610
No one wants to live

442
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,150
in your world, Emperor.

443
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,320
You ore a monster!

444
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,940
And what delightful place is this?

445
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,350
A safe house.

446
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,230
But maybe not so safe for you.

447
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,650
You are Section 31.

448
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,320
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

449
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,650
You're a tyrant.

450
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,030
A real one.

451
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,530
Torture wouldn't work.

452
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,950
How do you know so much about people like me?

453
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,670
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

454
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,040
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

455
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,090
And I can't have thot in o partner.

456
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,340
- We're not partners. - No?

457
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,220
I've been very helpful.

458
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,060
You had a plan that couldn't work.

459
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,350
I gave you a better one.

460
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,810
You gave me a tqste of the action,

461
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,730
knowing I'd want more.

462
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,860
You need me.

463
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,230
You chose me.

464
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,280
Why?

465
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,570
Whatever you believed your mission was,

466
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,620
it's worse than you thought.

467
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,080
Blllions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

468
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,080
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

469
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,500
The only way this works is if I know

470
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,800
exactly who I'm dealing with.

471
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,600
I'm not from this time, either.

472
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,060
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

473
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,650
You are 350 years old?

474
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,070
More or less.

475
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,610
I slept most of that time.

476
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,580
After my exile.

477
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,580
The Eugenics Wars.

478
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,750
Augments.

479
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,510
took my planet.

480
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
My home.

481
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,140
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

482
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,730
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

483
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,980
But I gave some back.

484
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,480
She noticed me.

485
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,860
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

486
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,950
They called her Giri the Morked.

487
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,910
She took me in.

488
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,120
Made me stronger than any human should be.

489
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,670
She ripped me opart

490
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,250
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

491
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,340
And I did terrible things.

492
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,760
AlI for a monster like you.

493
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:19,140
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

494
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,560
murder.

495
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,190
You haven't killed me.

496
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,650
Yet.

497
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,700
I recognized the weapon because I ordered it to be built.

498
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Gather your people.

499
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,170
We're gonna need every one of them.

500
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,540
In my universe, there were always plotters.

501
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,210
Always a coup.

502
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,380
So I built a weapon to end all threots.

503
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,220
I called it the Godsend.

504
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,930
It triggers a chain reaction,

505
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,560
like a virus passing between planets.

506
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,310
Everything in its poth incinerates.

507
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,900
An entire quadrant would be lost.

508
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,270
If my enemies managed to kill me,

509
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,440
there would be nothing left to rule.

510
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,240
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

511
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,610
Sorry.

512
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,570
Yeah, no. Uh, justaqu it's just a quick one.

513
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,240
Is it Godsend or God's End?

514
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,290
Godsend or God's End?

515
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,670
I don't heara difference in what you're saying.

516
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:08,090
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

517
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,380
Yeah, I'm still not getting it. - The Godsend is...

518
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,840
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

519
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,800
lt's Godsend. No apostrophe. Send.

520
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,470
The Godsend is here.

521
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,760
How? lt's from another universe.

522
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,510
I don't know, but that man had it.

523
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,310
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

524
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,270
The one we know is Dada Noe.

525
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,400
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He cqn't be.

526
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,360
He's from the Terran Empire, and he brought the Godsend here.

527
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,650
That's the only way he can know about it.

528
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,150
And since we have him locked up tight,

529
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,990
- I'II interrogate him. No, no, no.

530
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,370
We cannot trust a single word this woman says. Yeah.

531
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,870
She cost us Melle.

532
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,830
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

533
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,790
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

534
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,210
Little? -

535
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,920
Scale- shamer!

536
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,670
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

537
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,340
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

538
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,710
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

539
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,380
...that she's the reason this is dll bollixed up.

540
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,340
She's the reason Melle's dead, and she's the reason

541
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,680
we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

542
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,010
Listen up.

543
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,810
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

544
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,230
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

545
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,310
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

546
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,040
What?

547
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,080
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

548
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,870
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

549
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,750
Mother of the Fatherland.

550
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,090
Overlord of Vulcan.

551
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,500
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

552
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,090
Philippa Georgiou Augustus laponius Centarius.

553
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,220
Cool.

554
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,510
That come with fries?

555
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,930
: That was good, right?

556
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,180
Okay.

557
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,140
Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

558
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,270
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

559
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,230
: Fine.

560
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,150
I'm Doda.

561
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,320
Dada Noe. just Dada, then Noe.

562
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,740
That's it. No in- betweens.

563
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,120
And l, uh.

564
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,540
I used to run a pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

565
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,790
What the shit, man? !

566
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,920
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

567
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,430
So now we both have lied. You are not that Doda.

568
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,260
You're what these people call his Mirror.

569
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,060
You came here from the Terran Empire,

570
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,480
and you brought the Godsend.

571
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,230
What's the Godsend?

572
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,940
My own war council tried to depose me.

573
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,280
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

574
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,330
I was an administrator

575
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,250
at an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

576
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,620
Uh, yeah.

577
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:56,250
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

578
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,050
Most thought it was a legend, but I knew it was real.

579
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,760
So you tried to sell it.

580
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,760
I wanted to Iive here quietly on its proceeds.

582
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,600
How did you get to our universe?

583
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,560
There was an ion storm.

584
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,610
Two of them, actually.

585
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,150
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

586
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,410
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire- -

587
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,120
an anomaly, they called it- but it was a passageway

588
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,160
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

589
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,330
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

590
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,630
Few know obout it. For now.

591
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,460
But it'll open again in four hours.

592
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,130
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

593
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,090
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

594
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,640
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

595
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,850
There's famine.

596
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,520
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

597
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,940
They need to find a new territory

598
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,690
to conquer and strip- mine.

599
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,230
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

600
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,980
they're gonna find that passageway- -

601
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,690
you know they will and they'll come

602
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,320
and they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

603
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,530
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

604
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,210
: They learned well from you.

605
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,460
Who else wants it?

606
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,540
I- I don't know, man.

607
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,920
I got an offer. The money was real.

608
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,170
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

609
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,260
- Who was he? -  No idea.

610
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,640
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

611
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,510
they know what they know because they learned it

612
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,180
from one of you.

613
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,450
Emergency transporter.

614
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,240
Well, this is great.

615
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,620
Oh, even better.

616
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,000
Is that...is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

617
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,290
I liked that ship.

618
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,120
What hoppened?

619
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,960
Sabotage.

620
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,550
What?

621
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,130
Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

622
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,630
lt was someone here.

623
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,970
Which means one of us is a mole.

624
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,770
Could be you. Could be you.

625
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,190
If it were me,

626
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,440
I would have murdered all of you already.

627
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,900
Look, boss, if there's a mole, you know it's not me.

628
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,900
I mean, that sounds pretty moley to me.

629
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,490
- I don'tknow.

630
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,240
We've been on like ten ops together.

631
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,040
Yeah, andI still don't even know what you look like, do I?

632
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,950
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

633
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,910
- You might change into anything you want. - What about Fuzz, huh?

634
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,960
He exists on a whole other scale than anybody else. - Mm, deflecting?

635
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,420
My wife is about to Iay our first litter of egg sacs.

636
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,590
No, Ihave190, 000 hatchlings on the way- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,260
...and I want them to live. Well, look,

638
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,760
you could find a motive for any of us.

639
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,510
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

640
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,470
You know, like- like Zeph and- and Fuzz or...

641
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,060
You are spinning out without Melle.

642
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,730
You cannot land on a choice.

643
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,850
Maybe you're putting that in my head because you're the mole.

644
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,480
Huh? How obout Garrett? She's new.

645
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,690
She doesn't care obout us.

646
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,190
I'm Starfleet.

647
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,900
Whoa. Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

648
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,320
ruffling her cape?

649
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,620
Okay, there's an old ship out there,

650
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,950
an old garbage scow.

651
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,660
Yeah, Ifound it when you were up there

652
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,240
interrogating metal head.

653
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,750
Must be years since anyone flew it,

654
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,120
but I think we can work with it

655
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:03,830
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

656
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,290
Mm. Idislike you less.

657
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,340
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get a dog.

658
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,590
I like order.

659
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:13,050
I like prediction and conclusion.

660
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,260
Then you're on the wrong team because we've got mole,

661
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,430
stranded on a dead planet,

662
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,140
no communication with the outside,

663
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,020
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

664
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,020
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

665
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,860
Speaking of which, Quas, what about the antenna array?

666
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,030
Uh, well

667
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,080
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

668
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,290
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

669
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,580
We work together.

670
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,750
Everyone stoys in sight. -  Yeah.

671
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,750
just.

672
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,210
Let's go.

673
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,480
Well, there goes that idea.

674
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,820
Our little mole has been really busy.

675
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,530
Ripped up all the wiring.

676
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,400
Two teams. I'll Iead one into the woods.

677
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:16,780
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

678
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,070
You stay here with the others

679
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,660
and try and fix the antenna array.

680
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,910
Why is she giving us orders now?

681
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,370
Because I'm Ietting her

682
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,080
and l'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

683
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,790
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

684
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,840
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

685
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,630
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

686
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,220
We'll take care of the antenna array.

687
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,130
Uh, I'm sorry.

688
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,640
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

689
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,350
with two people who want to kill me?

690
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:41,680
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

691
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,100
Okay?

692
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,850
Yep, thanks, Cap.

693
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,900
I mean, just fifty- fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

694
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,230
and then 25%, just get your ass out there.

695
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,480
Ilove you, too, Cop.

696
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,440
AII righty.  Aye, aye.

697
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,950
The internal circuitry on this old scow

698
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,330
is still in decent shape.

699
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:12,670
Everything I'm seeing should work.

700
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,840
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

701
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,970
your engineers, did they install a fail- safe?

702
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,140
Can we disable it remotely?

703
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,390
There is no fail- safe. I wouldn't allow it.

704
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,690
How very on- brand for you.

705
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,110
Can I ask you one more question?

706
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:34,280
I'mjust gonna ask you one more question.

707
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,820
So you brought the Godsend into the world

708
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,030
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

709
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,910
Never thought that was a little, you know, much?

710
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,620
I ordered it destroyed.

711
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,790
And someone hid it. Your own people betrayed you.

712
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,170
Well, your corporate culture was straight- up shit.

713
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,380
And you didn't answer my question.

714
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,880
The asymptote coil is gone.

715
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,060
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

716
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,100
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

717
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,600
Maybe the cargo hull. Huh. Oh, no, no.

718
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,440
Everyone stays together, all right?

719
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,280
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

720
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,110
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

721
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,910
Aren't you coming?

722
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,910
Yes. Icouldn't be more excited.

723
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,160
Yeah, Icould help you down there, of course,

724
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,540
but considering how, you know, control

725
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,540
is central to your entire identity

726
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,550
and the fact that I'm just not good atit,

727
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:38,090
I'mjust gonna stand here and honor our relationship

728
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,470
by doing absolutely nothing.  Helpful.

729
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,180
It's called radical self- acceptance.

730
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,680
Evolved of you. Well, thank you.

731
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,260
So, can you fix it?

732
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:49,230
I'm not even sure it's broken. lt's just missing a part.

733
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,520
Look, this- this torn wiring Iooks dramatic,

734
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,440
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

735
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,940
There's an easy work- around.

736
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,530
Except somebody ripped out the the tq junction.

737
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,280
Other than that, this thing should work.

738
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,410
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

739
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,460
Garrett? - Yeah.

740
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,750
Zeph.

741
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,790
Where is Zeph?

742
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
Zeph, come in.

743
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,430
Zeph, do you copy?

744
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,940
Zeph.

745
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,860
Garrett, was that you?

746
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,410
Garrett, what the hell was that?

747
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,460
Someone just activated the antenno array.

748
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,420
Damn it.

749
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,790
What's happening?

750
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,300
Garrett, sitrep.

751
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,630
This is going to be good.

752
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,590
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

753
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,810
Clear.

754
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,400
Clear.

755
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,900
Nothing here.

756
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,440
How could someone have used this to send out a signal?

757
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,650
lmpossible. lt's missing a part.

758
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,030
And someone shot it to hell.

759
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
I heard someone running.

760
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,030
Zeph must have put the thetq junction back in.

761
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,450
Then shot it after he used the array.

762
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,330
So he must hove circled back after he went AWOL.

763
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,670
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

764
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,550
And now that we're stranded,

765
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,180
he sent a message to whoever he's working with.

766
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,180
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

767
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,930
and then he's long gone.

768
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,520
Then we need to find him first.

769
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,150
Observer, do you copy?

770
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,820
Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

771
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,030
That's funny. Status?

772
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:10,620
I'm picking up a lot of interference,

773
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,410
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

774
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,700
was just in this sector. Over.

775
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,750
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

776
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,670
The warlord you served, Giri, what happened to her?

777
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
She died like she lived.

778
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,890
By that, you know what I mean.

779
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,180
She was lucky.

780
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,260
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

781
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,680
lnfected? - Yeah.

782
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,930
A monster can only be a monster.

783
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,190
A monster with regrets is useless.

784
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,770
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

785
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,610
in a bar ot the ass end of nowhere.

786
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,030
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

787
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,780
To wipe your slate clean.

788
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,320
There's always a price to pay for people like us.

789
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,330
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

790
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,200
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

791
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,910
You think I'm a monster who feels enough to be controlled

792
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,750
but still do the real dirty work.

793
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,170
No, I think you want the Godsend back because you know

794
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,790
it's your one chance to redeem yourself

795
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,420
for all the shit you've done.

796
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,260
I want the Godsend bock because it's mine.

797
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,770
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is Ieaking.

798
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,650
Yep, more.

799
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,160
This way.

800
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,570
Blip, Clip,

801
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,480
Grip,

802
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,820
Polio, lnfluensina,

803
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:13,870
- Cowpox...- What are you saying?

804
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,780
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

805
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,700
Since one of you is going to murder me,

806
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,290
I'm never gonna meet them, but at Ieast I can honor them

807
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:23,670
one by one.

808
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,170
Trip,

809
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,540
Trip 2,

810
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,720
Tonsilyitis, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

811
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,550
Are you gonna sob out 190, 000 names?

812
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,720
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

813
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,510
Might he have recorded what happened?

814
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,010
Sure.

815
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,970
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

816
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,020
We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

817
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,610
Whatever data is left, we'll know who did this.

818
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,480
You say that like we're all suspects.

819
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,150
We're not. All right?

820
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,700
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened-

821
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,120
everyone in sight of everyone else.

822
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,410
And nobody went anywhere, right?

823
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,450
Right. -  umm.

824
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,630
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

825
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:10,550
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

826
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,230
This is insane.

827
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,770
Stop fidgeting.

828
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,400
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

829
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,110
Okay, so you're into mecha boom- boom.

830
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
Lots of humans are. No shame.

831
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,200
Well, that's impossible.

832
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,680
Lieutenant Garrett,

833
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,640
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

834
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,440
Lieutenant Garrett,

835
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:14,320
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

836
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,320
and evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

837
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,700
Not very Starfleet.

838
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,450
Oh, Iam very Starfleet.

839
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,040
And you know I didn't do this.

840
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,620
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

841
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,840
And deep down in that pure little heart,

842
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,920
you're actuallya chaos goblin, aren't you?

843
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:38,470
- I know you have itin you, angel. - Don't call me that.

844
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,090
Starfleet sniffed you out

845
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,970
and put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

846
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:47,390
Section 31 is just the place for officers who bend the rules,

847
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,650
never quite break them until they do.

848
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,480
And you fit right in here.

849
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,990
You can torture me all you want.

850
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,700
You will never make me o murderer.

851
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,910
No.

852
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,640
We've got footage!

853
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,020
Stop!

854
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,850
Stop!

855
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,190
This is my suit.

856
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,520
I am the suit!

857
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,990
The suit is me!

858
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,530
One second.

859
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,660
We were your friends. We were your friends.

860
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,460
You can't kill me. -

861
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,670
Zeph, no. You can't kill...

862
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,220
Zeph killed himself?

863
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,840
Why would he do that?

864
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,260
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

865
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,520
Look, none of this is making any sense.

866
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,940
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

867
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,600
Why would he do this? Uh.

868
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,560
Give me a couple minutes to......- We don't have minutes.

869
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,900
Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

870
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,240
Could be you.  Could be you.

871
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,820
And I still don't even know what you look like.

872
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,570
You could change into anything you want.

873
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,160
She's new. She doesn't care about us.

874
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,870
I'm Starfleet. - Whoa.

875
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:29,250
When you are talking about the suit,

876
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,080
you're talking about Zeph.

877
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,080
This isn't Fuzz.

878
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,000
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

879
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,540
I'm inside.

880
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,130
Scale- shamer!

881
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,760
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

882
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,890
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

883
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:47,390
There's an autopilot.

884
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,970
That's the only thing that makes sense.

885
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,980
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

886
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,190
That's why its responses were so strange.

887
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:04,160
Aren't you coming? - Yes.

888
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,200
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

889
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,120
And once you were inside...

890
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,250
Somebody ripped out the theta junction.

891
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,210
Garrett, where's Zeph?

892
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,670
Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

893
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,880
While the others were out Iooking for him,

894
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,590
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

895
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,050
and send those messages.

896
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,100
Don't do this to them!

897
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,470
We were your friends.

898
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,100
Then you destroyed the evidence.

899
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,650
And you killed Zeph.

900
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,650
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

901
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,490
Hands up, Fuzz.

902
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,870
Oh, shite and ever shite.

903
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,670
Whoa. You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

904
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,590
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

905
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,380
C- Can Ijust say one thing first?

906
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,270
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

907
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,570
Come on!

908
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,080
What happened to"no crew member Ieft behind"?

909
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,890
Come on, come on!

910
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,100
Get us closer.

911
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,960
Igot you. Igot you.

912
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,720
Nice and easy.  Damn.

913
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,570
You keep tabs on the black market, umm?

914
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:14,490
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

915
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,860
Why do you care?

916
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,740
You killed your family.

917
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,540
What's a few billion more people, huh?

918
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:22,410
Where is it? And who are you working with?

919
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,290
You took your crown while they died in agony

920
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,420
not ten feet away.

921
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,380
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

922
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,180
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

923
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,260
How could you know that?

924
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:42,060
Glad you're catching on.

925
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,020
He played you, Emperor.

926
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,060
San's alive.

927
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,190
lt's not possible.

928
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:56,780
That's not possible. How?

929
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,450
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

930
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,740
Teeny tiny doses over time.

931
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,370
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

932
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,290
Where is he? !

933
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,960
He's gonna put on quite the show.

934
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,090
You built the Godsend.

935
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,970
You made this monster.

936
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,220
This is all you.

937
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,770
Be careful, all right?

938
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,390
I said be careful.

939
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,480
I have to get around in that.

940
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,360
You can afford a hundred of them now.

941
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,690
Oh, great.

942
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,860
I'd settle for one that works.

943
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,620
So that's it?

944
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,240
The almighty Godsend.

945
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,620
When you're emperor,

946
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,330
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

947
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,140
Once that passageway opens up,

948
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,770
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

949
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,310
They're detonating it here.

950
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,190
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

951
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,070
So he throws the Federotion into chaos.

952
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,200
Starfleet will start scrambling.

953
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,990
Perfect time to invode.

954
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,580
You gave birth to this thing.

955
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,710
- How do we stop it? -  We don't.

956
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:13,210
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

957
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,540
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

958
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,050
That is bullshit.

959
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,050
You can do better than that. - l can't.

960
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,340
The Godsend is me.

961
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,640
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

962
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,390
The past always catches up with you.

963
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,770
Right?

964
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,770
Doesn't mean it always wins.

965
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,900
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

966
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,530
We'll get that scow running.

967
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,870
Boss, the scow won't fly.

968
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,740
Not without an asymptote coil.

969
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,210
We have one.

970
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,120
We'll catch up with San.

971
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,540
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

972
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,090
You ripped out the coil.

973
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,590
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

974
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,430
Asshole.

975
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,480
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

976
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,660
Stil just one pulse.

977
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,460
And we're in business.

978
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:37,580
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

979
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,210
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

980
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:42,420
AII right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

981
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,340
I'm assuming San's ship will be armed.

982
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:47,180
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

983
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:49,550
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

984
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,680
and we are a garbage barge.

985
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,230
Why are you laughing?

986
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:56,270
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

987
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,400
Let's go.

988
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,080
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

989
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,000
People jettison their garbage into space,

990
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,920
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

991
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,170
along with the field.

992
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,130
Once the tractor field is full,

993
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,880
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

994
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,720
where it disintegrates in the rodiation.

995
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,640
I just want to be clear.

996
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,510
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

997
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,350
a beam for collecting garbage?

998
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,730
Yes. Great.

999
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,560
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1000
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,360
Where are you going? - Engineering.

1001
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,900
If that's our only weapon,

1002
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,900
I'II redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1003
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,030
That's actually a good plan.

1004
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,380
We're in position.

1005
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,470
The passagewoy will open soon.

1006
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,310
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1007
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,680
Just a big space, you know,

1008
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:19,480
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and.

1009
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,560
What do you want?

1010
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,530
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1011
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:28,740
I get you guys are all"eternal nemesis,

1012
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,570
sexy evil tension"and stuff, but...

1013
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,990
Alert.

1014
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,410
lncoming vessel.

1015
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,330
Collision trajectory detected.

1016
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,620
Of course she got it off the ground.

1017
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:43,000
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1018
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,260
They've picked us up.

1019
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,220
Photon torpedo incoming.

1020
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,550
Impact in five, fourReally want to take evqsive action right now!

1021
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,100
...three, two, one. Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1022
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,400
Why isn't she changing course?

1023
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,020
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1024
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:10,150
Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1025
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,990
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1026
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:14,830
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1027
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:18,120
Keep it steady. We're almost there...three, two, one.

1028
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,830
Now.

1029
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,380
Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1030
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,140
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1031
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,640
She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1032
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,190
How's everybody feeling about this?

1033
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,400
It's the only way.

1034
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,650
This can work.

1035
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,530
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1036
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:53,530
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1037
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,240
Target lock malfunction.

1038
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,000
Ican't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1039
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,500
San?

1040
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,750
San.

1041
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,540
San!

1042
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,010
Radiation levels critical.

1043
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,220
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1044
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,850
And San's?

1045
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,690
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1046
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,980
Plasma incoming!

1047
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,440
We get caught with a burst like that,

1048
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,690
and we're done.

1049
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:34,030
This is chaos, Garrett.

1050
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,530
You know you love it, umm?

1051
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,410
Mqybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1052
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,450
lt's why Starfleet put you here.

1053
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,290
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1054
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:45,540
Yeah, Garrett, let's get messy.

1055
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,500
umm? - Okay.

1056
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,250
You got this, Quas. Uh- huh.

1057
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,550
You ready?

1058
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,090
San's shields are at four percent.

1059
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,880
Two now.

1060
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,760
His shields are down.

1061
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:59,220
Good to go.

1062
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,800
Philippa!

1063
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:46,770
This contest only ends

1064
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:50,060
when one of us is dead!

1065
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:59,200
Detonation sequence activating.

1066
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:02,580
See, the Nanokins, we don't need the Federation.

1067
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,910
We never have.

1068
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,460
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1069
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,330
and we will rule again after you're gone.

1070
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,470
Guess who survives very Iarge explosions.

1071
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,970
Very small things.

1072
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,060
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to cut our ship loose.

1073
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,270
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1074
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:32,110
No, I'm joking.

1075
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,520
I can't wait to kill them.

1076
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,400
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1077
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,210
Who's flying that?

1078
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,050
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life- form on board,

1079
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,880
and it's heading right for us.

1080
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,470
Plot missile lock.

1081
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1082
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:27,870
But one.

1083
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,080
San.

1084
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1085
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,590
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1086
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,090
He's heading back to San's ship.

1087
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,510
We're barely keeping up. - Stay on him.

1088
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,260
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1089
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:49,890
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1090
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,230
Do not lose that shuttle.

1091
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:52,690
Okay.

1092
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,190
I was nothing!

1093
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,030
That boy was soft, weak.

1094
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:07,120
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1095
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:10,120
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1096
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,290
My Empire!

1097
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,500
And we will reign over this universe

1098
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,290
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1099
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:22,920
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1100
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,520
You taught me that.

1101
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,810
We can come back from this.

1102
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,650
We can start over.

1103
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,620
Oh, I love chaos.

1104
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,290
Chaos is my jam.

1105
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,380
I love chaos. I love chaos.

1106
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,960
Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1107
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,760
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1108
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,970
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1109
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,640
You got to trust me, okay?

1110
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,970
Hi there.

1111
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,680
I'm so glad you found me.

1112
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,020
What'd you just say?

1113
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,270
lt's atoy.

1114
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,150
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1115
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,610
Shall we do something fun together?

1116
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1117
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,780
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1118
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:32,740
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1119
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:35,830
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1120
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,580
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1121
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,790
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1122
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:43,050
You better hope that this ship's hull

1123
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:45,050
is reinforced with Tomohite.

1124
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,240
I am a science officer.

1125
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,000
And science is just controlled chaos.

1126
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,670
Whoa, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos!

1127
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,430
Ah, come on.

1128
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,930
Get up, you stupid robot.

1129
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,250
No. No.

1130
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:59,710
No!

1131
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,630
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship so we can open the payload bay.

1132
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,590
Uh, yeah.

1133
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,430
About that.

1134
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,050
Uh, thing is...Quasi, there's about to be a very large explosion.

1135
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,140
This console's in a language I don't know.

1136
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,560
I can decipher some of it.

1137
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,970
I just have to break it down to morphemes

1138
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,640
and, you know...Large explosion impending.

1139
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,310
Either of these two buttons could open the cargo bay.

1140
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,600
Okay, so push them both.

1141
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:24,810
Either of these two buttons could also

1142
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:26,150
initiate a self- destruct protocol.

1143
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,440
- We're gonna blow up anyway. - Uh- huh.

1144
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,820
- Um, uh. Huh? - Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

1145
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,660
You just need to make o call.

1146
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,120
You know what to do.

1147
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,740
Okoy. Okay.

1148
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,840
We can be friends forever...

1149
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:37,050
Do you want to hear something funny?

1150
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,970
I'm on autopilot.

1151
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,070
What the hell?

1152
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:51,900
We're all gonna die.

1153
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:54,650
We're all gonna die.

1154
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,080
No!

1155
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,910
lt's wonderful just to be with you.

1156
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,500
Whoo! - Whoa!

1157
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,750
Yes!

1158
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:38,820
Die now.

1159
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:43,080
Go tell your family how much you've changed.

1160
01:22:57,970 --> 01:22:59,680
San.

1161
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,310
No. No.

1162
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,520
No.

1163
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,190
San.

1164
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,480
San.

1165
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:14,860
This is not what I want.

1166
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,150
Please.

1167
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,990
: llove you. : llove you.

1168
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,830
San.

1169
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,200
San.

1170
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:26,250
I'm sorry.

1171
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,620
I'm so sorry.

1172
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:31,500
You- you- you were right.

1173
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,930
I still needed you.

1174
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,260
I alwoys needed.

1175
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,680
To show me who I am, even now.

1176
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,560
Now.

1177
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,570
M- M...My emperor.

1178
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,110
My love.

1179
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:04,330
No.

1180
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,870
We are one.

1181
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,040
Forever.

1182
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:22,470
Ion storm convergence imminent.

1183
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,650
Passageway is opening.

1184
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,130
Biosignature confirmed.

1185
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,880
Detonation in 60 seconds.

1186
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,050
Computer, target lock on the passogeway.

1187
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:08,310
Target lock confirmed.

1188
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:13,440
If you could go back,

1189
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,270
and you were kneeling in front of Giri,

1190
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,110
would you kill her?

1191
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:21,110
Would you put a stop to all the suffering and smoke forever,

1192
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:24,780
even if it meant that you had to die?

1193
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,290
Yes.

1194
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,290
Then I'm glad I knew you, Alok Sahar.

1195
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,300
Detonation in 30 seconds.

1196
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,980
Passageway is open.

1197
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:58,480
Sensors show they've activated impulse engines.

1198
01:25:58,610 --> 01:25:59,860
What?

1199
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,480
Yeah. You need to transport them back.

1200
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:02,740
Yeah. Okay. Now.

1201
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,490
Okay, okay, okoy, okay.

1202
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:08,700
The storm's interfering. I can't lock on to them.

1203
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,420
Detonation in ten seconds.

1204
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,010
Come on. Come on!

1205
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,300
They're running out of time.

1206
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,760
I'm trying.

1207
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,300
Detonation in five,

1208
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,370
Lieutenant Gorrett?

1209
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,790
Rachel?

1210
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:08,430
You all right?

1211
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:09,720
- l'mokay. umm? You here?

1212
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,220
Yeah. You're alive. All right.

1213
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,010
Yeah, Quasi got us out.

1214
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,640
There we go. There we are. -  Thank you.

1215
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:16,060
Oh, you did it.

1216
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,940
Oh, we won.

1217
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,190
Oh. Grow up.

1218
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:23,900
Perkiness is disgusting.

1219
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:26,070
Yeah.

1220
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,030
I hear you.

1221
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:31,990
lt's happening.

1222
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,490
The passageway's collapsing.

1223
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,810
There she is.

1224
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,480
How was your debrief?

1225
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,190
Oh, could've been worse.

1226
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,990
They made me an offer.

1227
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:51,650
And?

1228
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,780
l'm sitting on it. -

1229
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,870
You?

1230
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,160
And how long did you think

1231
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:04,920
you could fool me with this, umm?

1232
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:08,170
- What gave it away?

1233
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,170
You still get nervous when I look at you.

1234
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,680
Oh. Hey, C- Cap.

1235
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,180
Leave that poor man alone.

1236
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,680
Virgil.

1237
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,680
A round of elixirs for my friends.

1238
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:20,680
Pleasure, Madame du Franc. Mm- umm.

1239
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:23,350
Lieutenant Gorrett.

1240
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,690
They let you off the ship.

1241
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,400
lt's actually Lieutenant Commander Garrett now.

1242
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,980
Oh. - Thank you very much.

1243
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,530
And if this unit is gonna be a permanent detail,

1244
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:33,530
then you all definitely need oversight.

1245
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:37,370
I may slaughter you all at any moment.

1246
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,240
Is that adeal- breaker?

1247
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:42,080
Nah. Whatevs.

1248
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,540
It's not like you need a reason anyway.

1249
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,420
- lt's true. You'reabad bitch. -

1250
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,750
With the stare of death.  Oh, we get it.

1251
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,670
You're a terrifying, soulless murderer

1252
01:29:49,670 --> 01:29:51,550
who we can never truly trust.

1253
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:53,260
I love that for us.

1254
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:55,680
Somebody's got to keep things lively.

1255
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,930
Touche. -  Yes, touche. You make a point.

1256
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:01,020
To us.

1257
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:02,560
To us.

1258
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,560
This isn't poison, is it?

1259
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:09,230
And now that you have us all here,

1260
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,230
what next?

1261
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:11,400
Well, not quite all.

1262
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:14,400
Ladies and gent, stage left.

1263
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,990
You got to be kidding me.

1264
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,870
Oh, I'm not Fuzz.

1265
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:24,080
Section 31 bought

1266
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:27,250
two of these conveyances on the black market.

1267
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,880
Name's Wisp. I'm his wife.

1268
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,590
And I'm here for when we catch up with

1269
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,760
that lying, double- dealing son of a bitch.

1270
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,430
Uh, well, we blew up his ship, ma'am.

1271
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:38,640
- Uh, Mrs. Fuzz. Oh, honey.

1272
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,140
Little things sometimes survive big explosions.

1273
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,100
And when we find him, I have questions.

1274
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:48,150
- Now, what are we talking about? -  I'm glad you asked.

1275
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:50,060
I was just letting the team know.

1276
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,780
Control has a job for us.

1277
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:07,460
My better judgment has been

1278
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,040
screaming at me for two days now.

1279
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:14,420
It keeps saying that you lot are gonna cost me my job.

1280
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,220
- We might. - She might.

1281
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,430
I told my judgment to shut up

1282
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:20,470
and tqke a nap.

1283
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,140
Cause we have work to do.

1284
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,690
Hqs anybody been to Turkana IV?

1285
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,770
- Whew.  Wait.

1286
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,650
Did you say Turkana or say jur- jurnana?

1287
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,320
He thought"Your Mama IV. "

1288
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,610
Oh, Your Mama IV.

1289
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:39,530
No.
