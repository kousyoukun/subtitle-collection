00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:07,650
人类帝国

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,686
她回来了 她终于回到家了
She's back! She's home!

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,229
菲利帕回家了
Philippa came home!

5
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,107
两年过去了
YOUNG GEORGIOU: Two years,

6
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:34,153
一切都和记忆中一模一样
αnd everything looks exactly as I remember.

7
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,158
我以为再也见不到这里了
I never thought I would see this place again.

8
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,539
这一次我们有18个人
There were 18 of us this time.

9
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,377
从帝国各个角落被选中
Culled from every corner of the Empire

10
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,129
带到地球参加比试
αnd brought to Terra for the contest.

11
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,633
他们说只有一个人能活到最后
We were told that only one of us would survive

12
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,885
熬过这些年
the years to come.

13
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,138
一个孩子…
One child.

14
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,894
…最纯粹的帝国血脉
...the purest expression of the Terran identity.

15
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,023
他们让我们自相残杀
They pitted us against each other.

16
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,236
一个月又一个月 我们的人数不断减少
And month by month, our numbers dwindled.

17
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,366
你...你赢了吗
FATHER: Did...did you win?

18
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,743
结束了吗
ls it over?

19
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,955
还剩下两个人
Two of us still live.

20
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,588
桑和我
San and me.

21
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,884
我和桑
Me and San.

22
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,889
我们是二人
BOTH: We are two...

23
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,475
…却如一人
...but one.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,519
永远如此
BOTH: Forever.

25
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,232
比试期间”朋友”这个词是被禁止的
The word "friend" was forbidden during the contest,

26
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,610
但无人时我们会悄悄对彼此说出这个词
but we whispered it to each other when no one could hear.

27
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
桑和我联手对抗
San and I combined our skills

28
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,451
总督和其他参赛者
αgainst the proctor and the other contestants.

29
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,120
但只能有一个人成为皇帝
But only one of you could be emperor.

30
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,541
还剩最后一个任务
One task remains.

31
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,920
谁先完成谁就能统治帝国
The first to complete it rules the Empire,

32
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,756
另一个人余生都将
and the other spends the rest of their life

33
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,924
侍奉新皇帝
in servitude to the new emperor.

34
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,218
你们要做什么
What do you have to do?

35
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,069
对不起
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,071
你做了什么
What did you do? !

37
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,076
”不允许与过去有任何牵绊
”No ties to the old life are permitted.

38
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,664
皇帝只能忠于职责
”An emperor can only be loyal to duty.

39
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,919
帝国因此而强大
"Thus does the Empire remain strong.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,379
帝国因此而强盛”
Thus does it grow. "

41
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,552
-妈妈 -菲利帕
Mom. Philippa.

42
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,769
你成功了 而你的对手失败了
You succeeded where your competitor could not.

43
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,857
把他带上来
Bring him here.

44
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,905
桑没有力量通过最后的考验
San did not have the strength to pass the final test.

45
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:51,493
此刻他的村庄正在燃烧 昭示着他的懦弱
Even now, his village burns as a testament to his cowardice.

46
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,582
我爱你
: llove you.

47
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,586
你赢了这场较量
TERRAN PROCTOR: You have won the contest.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,089
来领取你的胜利吧
Claim your victory.

49
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,274
桑 上前来
San, step forward.

50
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,820
你如今只为臣服于她而活
You live now only to serve at her heel.

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,378
跪拜吧 向掌控你生命的人
Kneel before the one who owns your life.

52
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,601
我们本为二者…
: We are two...

53
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,145
却合为一体
But one.

54
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,607
但这一切已经结束了
Not anymore.

55
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,013
向乔治欧陛下致敬
TERRAN PROCTOR: AII hail Philippa Georgiou!

56
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,806
向帝王致敬
AlI hail the emperor!

57
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,352
致敬 致敬 致敬
CROWD: Hail! Hail! Hail!

58
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,646
致敬
Hail!

59
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,578
这里是指挥部
CONTROL: This is Control

60
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,539
向阿尔法小队队长发送优先级消息
with a priority message for Alpha Team Leader.

61
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,960
你的目标是菲利帕·乔治欧
Your subject is Emperor Philippa Georgiou,

62
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,629
特伦帝国的前任统治者
former ruler of the Terran Empire.

63
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,381
她来自一个平行宇宙
lt's in a parallel universe

64
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,800
那里的罪犯数量之多
with the most criminal population

65
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,177
史无前例
in recorded history.

66
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,681
即便在那里 乔治欧的暴行也是最令人发指的
Even there, Georgiou had the market cornered on atrocities.

67
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,312
2257年 她被带到我们的宇宙
ln 2257, she was brought to our universe

68
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,105
加入了31区
αnd joined Section 31,

69
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,026
但几年后我们失去了联系
but after a few years, we lost contact.

70
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,988
最近 乔治欧用假身份出现
Recently, Georgiou was spotted using an alias

71
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,450
在联邦空间外的边境地带
in the border territory outside Federation space,

72
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,537
我们正在那里追踪黑市上的一个新威胁
where we're tracking a new threat on the black market.

73
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,790
这就是你们小队的任务
This is where your team comes in.

74
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,752
联邦条约禁止我们越过那条边境线
Federation treaty forbids us from crossing over that border,

75
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,297
这意味着星际舰队不能直接插手
which means Starfleet cannot get its hands dirty.

76
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,842
你和你的31区小队将潜入 与乔治欧取得联系
You and your 31 team will go in, make contact with Georgiou

77
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:58,180
帮助识别并消除这个威胁
to help identify and neutralize the threat.

78
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,974
但要记住…
But make no mistqke...

79
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,978
这条恶犬会咬人 小心你们的后背
this dog bites, so watch your backs.

80
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,482
你们有24小时完成任务
You have 24 hours to complete the mission.

81
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,526
开始行动吧
Get to work.

82
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,455
星际述肌: 31区
ed3000翻译官 译

83
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,392
星历1292. 4

84
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,834
杜弗朗克夫人
VIRGIL: Madame du Franc?

85
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,212
蜜月套房发生了点小意外
Small incident in the honeymoon suite.

86
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,755
恐怕那位新娘在关键时刻
I'm afraid the bride molted

87
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,633
蜕皮了
just as things were coming to a climax.

88
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,302
维吉尔 说重点
GEORGIOU: Virgil, get to the point. -

89
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,931
我已派生化危机小组前去 并转达了您的慰问
I sent a biohazard team and your condolences.

90
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,852
另外 有位客人希望能与您谈谈
Also, there's a customer hoping for α word with you.

91
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,523
他看起来很清醒 但却令人着迷
He seems entirely sober but quite intoxicating.

92
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,574
杜弗朗克夫人愿意见您
Mqdame Veronique du Franc will see you.

93
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,835
阿洛克·萨哈尔 见过杜弗朗克夫人
Alok Sahar, Madame Veronique du Franc.

94
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,089
杜弗朗克夫人通常需要预约才见客
Madame du Franc normally does business by appointment.

95
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,674
我想预约
I'd like to make an oppointment.

96
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,260
哦 这位先生想预约呢
Oh, the gentleman would like to make an appointment.

97
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,512
现在 现在 夫人
ALOK: Now. VIRGIL: Now, madame.

98
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,889
不可能 不可能
: lmpossible. : lmpossible.

99
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,354
嗯
GEORGIOU: Mmm.

100
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,277
嗯
Mmm.

101
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,570
再见 维吉尔
Au revoir, Virgil.

102
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,031
嗯哼
Mm- hmm.

103
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,047
这是违法的
ALOK: That is illegal.

104
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,633
而这能赚钱
And that makes money.

105
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,885
这是家正经场所
GEORGIOU: This is a reputable establishment.

106
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,429
我听说不是
ALOK: Not what I heard.

107
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,806
不如去你办公室谈谈 嗯？
- Why don't we discuss it in your office? - Hmm.

108
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,977
我为什么要带你去我的办公室 阿洛克·萨哈尔？
Why would I take you to my office, Alok Sahar?

109
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,939
因为这需要亲身体验
Because it's α hands- on experience.

110
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,750
甜蓟花
ALOK: Dulcet thistle.

111
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,669
甜蓟花已经灭绝了
Dulcet thistle's extinct.

112
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,421
我有十二公斤这玩意
I've got α dozen keys of this stuff.

113
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,090
要来点吗？
Have you partaken?

114
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,304
这会是我少有的第一次体验之一
This would be one of my few first times.

115
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,389
劲很大
Packs a punch.

116
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,309
让人愉悦的那种
- Ahappy punch. Mmm.

117
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,652
干杯
Bottoms up.

118
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,404
为金钱 为你
- To money. To you.

119
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,411
嗯
GEORGIOU: Mmm.

120
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,630
现在 别装了
Now, let's cut the shit.

121
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,634
31区来我的空间站做什么?
What is Section 31 doing in my space station?

122
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,054
嗯？以为我认不出特工吗？
Hmm? You think I don't know an agent when I see one?

123
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,014
你带着六名特工
You're heading up a team of six operatives,

124
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,475
他们都在酒吧里
αnd they're dll over the bar.

125
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,521
那边那个变形者
There's the Chameloid,

126
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,232
绿血的变种人
α green- blooded shape- shifter,

127
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,194
正试图勾引一个德尔塔人
trying to muster sexy time with a Deltan,

128
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,904
一个活生生的诱饵
a walking honey trap

129
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,157
31区显然在用她转移注意力
31's obviously using αs a distraction.

130
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:13,120
但变形者是银河系唯一
Except Chameloids are the only species in the galaxy

131
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,748
对德尔塔人魅力免疫的种族
immune to Deltan sexy time charm.

132
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,335
还有那边那个全身高科技装备的家伙
Then there's the guy with all the high- end mech,

133
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,464
站在后面一副若有所思的样子
standing in the back, looking like he has thoughts.

134
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,467
机械生命不只是靠蛮力
Mech life, it ain't just about the brute force.

135
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,181
我猜 武器很重 智商很轻
GEORGIOU: I'mgonna say heavy on artillery, low on IQ.

136
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,225
真遗憾
I'm so sorry.

137
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,685
别忘了那个瓦肯人
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

138
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,355
笑得比台上的笑话还夸张
laughing way too hard at the stage banter.

139
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:47,279
瓦肯人从不笑所以他要么也是个蠢货
And since Vulcans never laugh, he's either an idiot, too,

140
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,824
要么是庞法导致精神失常
or lost his mind during pon farr and went insane.

141
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,661
得了吧 这很好笑
Oh, come on. That was funny.

142
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,456
还有你安排的那个一本正经的人类…
GEORGIOU: And the very serious human you stuck him with.

143
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,207
收敛点吧
Reel it in anytime.

144
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,543
她屁股里的棍子插得太深了
...she's got a stick so far up her backside,

145
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,545
都从嘴里冒出来了
it's coming out her mouth.

146
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,088
收敛点
Just reel it in.

147
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,093
那是
ALOK: That would be

148
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,180
加勒特中尉
Lieutenant Garrett. - Mmm.

149
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,098
星际舰队
Starfleet.

150
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,769
欢乐的终结者
Where fun goes to die.

151
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,898
你们找到我花了够久的
It took you long enough to find me.

152
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,026
我们知道你在巴拉姆
We knew that having you here on the Baraam

153
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,320
总有一天会对我们有用
would be valuable to us one day.

154
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,948
我现在可没什么动力
Well, I'm not feeling motivated to be valuable

155
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,910
为别人效力
to anyone but myself.

156
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,924
那么 我们是不是该开始谈条件了？
So, is this where we start negotiating?

157
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,218
嗯 那要看情况
Hmm, that depends.

158
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,386
你知道我多久了
How long have you known about me?

159
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,139
从你接手前任店主开始
Ever since you took over from the previous owner,

160
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,849
那人至今下落不明
who we still haven't found.

161
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,184
听着
Well, all of.

162
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,311
-不是我干的 -皇帝
That wasn't me. Emperor Georgiou,

163
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,813
我被授权逮捕你
I am authorized to arrest you

164
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,815
并抹除你的记忆
and wipe your mind clean. -

165
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,275
但我内心有个声音
But then again, there's a part of me

166
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,694
想让你继续带着这些记忆活着
that wants you to live with your memories.

167
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,280
那些大屠杀的记忆
The genocidal ones.

168
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,117
你有权逮捕我
Being authorized to arrest me

169
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,372
不代表你有能力逮捕我
isn't the same as being able to arrest me.

170
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,124
你真想让31区 让我
You really want Section 31 want me- -

171
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,960
一直追着你不放吗
dogging you until the end of time?

172
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,379
无聊
: Boring.

173
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,715
过去总会追上你
The past always catches up with you.

174
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,884
不管你我是否承认
And as much as both of us

175
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,136
我这是在帮你
might hate it, I'm doing you α favor.

176
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,515
最后一个任务
One lqst mission.

177
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,642
听着
Listen.

178
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,645
你相信命运吗
Do you believe in fate?

179
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,355
我相信
Becouse I do.

180
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,691
你逃不过命运
You can't hide from it.

181
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,069
你在这里什么都不是 乔治欧
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

182
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,200
我给你机会重返战场
I'm giving you α chance to get back in.

183
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,245
参与银河系级别的行动
In on the action on a galactic scale.

184
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,706
别再逃避了
Stop running from it.

185
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,085
做回真正的自己
Be who you are.

186
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,383
或者继续在这当一辈子酒保
Or stay and tend bar for eternity.

187
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,514
开始吧
Let's get on with it.

188
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,697
菲利帕·乔治欧 来见见我的团队
ALOK: Philippα Georgiou, meet my team.

189
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,532
这是梅勒
This is Melle.

190
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,037
泽夫
Zeph.

191
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,289
你像个瑞士军刀
You look like a Swiss Army knife.

192
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,208
等等
Uh, hold on.

193
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,877
我不知道那是什么 但我不会
I don't know what that means, but I'm not gonna

194
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,128
站在这被侮辱
just stand here and get insulted.

195
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,588
我说的不是你
I'm not talking about you.

196
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,548
说的是你的战甲
I'm talking αbout your suit.

197
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,551
你是新来的
ZEPH: Um, you're new,

198
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,595
我就说这一次
so I'm gonna just explain this one time

199
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,473
当你说起战甲的时候
that when you are talking about the suit,

200
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,974
就是在说泽夫本人
you're talking about Zeph.

201
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,225
-噢 -泽夫患有
- Oh. QUASI: Zeph suffers from

202
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,894
所谓的机甲畸形症
what we call mecha dysmorphia.

203
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,896
虽然我不知道那是什么
ZEPH: And I may not know what that is,

204
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,314
但我也不会接受
but I'm also not gonna take that

205
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,982
你这么说 夸西 我很生气
from you, Quas, and personally I'm offended.

206
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,484
-你得知道... -这是事实
- I think you should know...- Well, it's accurate.

207
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,652
这不是诊断结果 你又不是医生
It's not α diagnosis. You're not α doctor.

208
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,070
泽夫 泽夫 泽夫
ALOK: Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

209
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,404
-他知道 他都知道 -好吧
- He knows. He knows. He knows. - Okay, fine.

210
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,447
他知道
He knows.

211
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,782
-他明白 他明白 -是的
He gets it. He gets it. Yes.

212
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,326
那个瓦肯人呢
Okay, what obout that Vulcan?

213
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,787
没人告诉她吗
Nobody told her?

214
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,790
这个 你说的这个
This? The thing you're talking to?

215
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,958
瓦肯人只是台机器
The Vulcan's just a machine.

216
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,919
我在里面
I'm inside.

217
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,046
操控着它
Driving.

218
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,140
我从后备载具里控制这具身体
I control the body from a backup vehicle.

219
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,018
用它进入一些狭小空间
Yeah, something I use to get into tight spots.

220
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,187
嗨你好
Hi there.

221
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,231
我是弗兹
I'm Fuzz.

222
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,858
弗兹是纳米族
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

223
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,360
很有趣的家伙
Real fun- loving guy.

224
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,736
你好
Hello.

225
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,947
除了他发起疯来的时候
Except for when he's not.

226
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,699
那时他就失控 有暴力倾向
Then he's deranged with an anger management problem.

227
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,159
你说第一点就够了 夸西
Well, you could've stopped αt the first thing, Quasi.

228
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,496
盗版瓦肯载具
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

229
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,250
黑市上一定有不少好东西
You must see cool stuff on the black market.

230
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,960
纳米族都爱捡破烂
QUASI: Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

231
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,920
31区第一次接触他们
31 made first contact when

232
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,880
是在一艘废弃飞船上发现了他们的寄生
we discovered an infestation on a derelict ship.

233
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,882
-夸西 -糟了
Quasi. Oh, shit.

234
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,302
再说一遍寄生 夸西
: Say"infestαtion"one more time, Quasi.

235
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,389
说啊 叫我捡破烂的 你这团黑灰
Soy"scavenger, "you sack of amorphous soot!

236
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,182
我...说完我就后悔了
l- ls- - I heard it as soon as I said it.

237
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,559
我要揍你
I will kick your ass

238
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,561
揍到你连个形状都凝聚不了
until you cannot form a solid mass of...

239
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,479
弗兹 弗兹 冷静
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

240
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,148
我很冷静
I am locked down.

241
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:39,404
我被困在这个巨大的机器瓦肯头里
I'm trapped inside α giant robot Vulcan head.

242
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,824
还有谁比我更冷静
No one is more locked down than me right now!

243
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,493
纳米族的情绪波动很奇怪
Nanokins have o wonky emotional spectrum.

244
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,495
不不不不不不 我不会
No, no, no, no, no, no, Iwillnot

245
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,788
接受你的轻视 梅勒
be condescended to, Melle,

246
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,457
尤其是你 说实话…
particularly not by you, because honest.

247
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,542
我爱你 你太完美了
MELLE: Ilove you. You are everything.

248
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,252
-我这情绪你喜欢吗 -弗兹
Does my spectrum work for you? - ZEPH: Fuzz.

249
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,755
-就是说 你觉得如何… -弗兹
- Imean, like, like, are you into it or...- Fuzz!

250
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,797
弗兹
Fuzz!

251
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,300
她在羞辱你 伙计
She's insulting you, pal.

252
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,010
我知道德尔塔人就这德行
I know Deltans are gonna do their Deltan thing,

253
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,220
但你也该有点自尊吧
but have a little self- respect, would you?

254
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,513
我们继续吗
Can we continue?

255
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,223
这位是瑞秋·加勒特中尉
And that's Lieutenant Rachel Gorrett.

256
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,684
她只为这次任务临时加入31区
She is detailed to Section 31 for this one mission only.

257
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,562
你得罪了谁才来黑ops的 中尉
Who did you piss off to get stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

258
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,983
星际舰队是来确保我们守规矩的
Starfleet is here to make sure we color inside the lines.

259
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,360
星际舰队是来保卫联邦
GARRETT: Starfleet is here to defend the Federation,

260
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,363
维护和平 防止谋杀发生的
keep the peace and make sure no one commits murder.

261
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,908
-那你呢 -等一下
·And you? - One moment.

262
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,326
夸西进入我的视野
ALOK: Quasi came on my radar

263
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,870
是因为他证实了神经簇的存在
when he proved the existence of glioclusters.

264
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,665
神经簇只是理论上存在
Glioclusters are theoretical.

265
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,292
曾经是理论上存在
Formerly theoretical.

266
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,961
生命就是无数分支的可能性
Life is just branching possibilities.

267
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,130
你知道它们会以你想象不到的方式绽放
You know, they bloom and blossom any way you can imagine.

268
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,258
比如说 我现在可能会被你吓到
For example, I could be intimidated by you right now.

269
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,302
毕竟 你杀过
I mean, after all, you've murdered

270
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,804
那么多人…
so many people.

271
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,973
而你似乎正在洞穿我的灵魂
and you seem to be staring right into my soul.

272
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,643
我可以对此做出回应
I could respond to that

273
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,102
或者我可以观察当下的感受
or I could observe my feelings right now,

274
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,688
把它锁起来 专注于该做的事
lock it away and do what I need to do.

275
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,483
或者…夸斯 选一个吧
- Or...- Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

276
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,235
好的 有时夸斯会看到
QUASI: Yes. - MELLE: Sometimes Quasi sees

277
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,154
太多选择而大脑当机 谢谢你 梅勒
so many options he gets brain- freeze. - Thank you, Melle.

278
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,241
夸斯 我们继续好吗 嗯
- Quasi, can we carryon, please? - Mm- hmm.

279
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,285
我们的目标是达达·诺伊
Our target's name is Dqda Noe.

280
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,995
道德观念成问题
Dubious moral compass.

281
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,748
他曾在瓦特殖民地经营一家病理实验室 后来叛逃了
Ran α pathology lab on the Watt Colonies before he went rogue.

282
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,252
从那以后 他一直在按需设计生物武器
Since then, he's been designing bioweapons on spec.

283
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,963
诺伊正在前往巴拉姆 准备把他最新的作品
Noe's on his way to the Baraam to sell his latest creation

284
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,631
卖给米诺斯最高议会
to the Minosian High Council.

285
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,634
虽然我们与米诺斯势力没有正式敌对
There are no formal hostilities with the Minosian Sway,

286
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,427
但如果他们得到这种
but that could change if they get their hands

287
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,887
超级武器 情况就会改变
on a superweapon.

288
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,764
我们知道这种生物超级武器是什么吗
GEORGIOU: Dowe know what this bio superweapon is?

289
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,850
不知道 但既然是达达·诺伊在卖 肯定很糟
GARRETT: No, but if Dada Noe is selling it, it's bad.

290
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,478
所以你们要确保这笔交易不会发生
So you're here to make sure the sale never happens.

291
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,856
怎么做
How?

292
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,316
虽然你发现我们时计划出了差错
Things went south when you spotted us,

293
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,528
但计划依然可行
but the plan is still solid.

294
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,781
首先 阿洛克要...
First, Alok was going to...

295
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,658
你可以说出来
You can soy it.

296
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,994
搭讪
Connect.

297
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,121
你
With you. -

298
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,999
欢迎光临 嗯
Welcome! Mmm. Yes.

299
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,837
多可爱的想法
What o cute idea.

300
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,214
趁你被分散注意力时
Once we had you suitably distracted,

301
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,301
夸斯就能做他擅长的另一件事
Quasi would do the other thing Quasi does.

302
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,469
好了 夸斯
ALOK: Okay, Quasi.

303
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,264
请开始吧 当然
- If you would do the honors. Absolutely.

304
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,315
让我们开工吧
Let's get to work.

305
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,364
欢迎 达达·诺伊
Welcome, Dada Noe.

306
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,575
这就到了弗兹登场的时候
ALOK: This is where Fuzz comes in.

307
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,750
你不会相信我能钻进多小的地方
FUZZ: You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

308
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,254
比如 体型改造装置的内部结构
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

309
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,757
一旦我飞进达达的体型改造装置
Oh, once I fly inside Dada's body mod,

310
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,884
就该大显身手了
well, then it's time to get to work.

311
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,219
那么多电路
So many circuits.

312
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,930
那么多可能出错的地方
So many things that could go wrong.

313
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,849
这位能力至上主义者会指导我
Competency crusader here will talk me through

314
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,309
植入物的技术细节
the tech on the implant.

315
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,478
如果我觉得改动那个植入物会
And if I think we're putting Dada Noe's life in danger

316
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,896
危及达达·诺伊的生命
by tinkering with that implant,

317
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,440
我就会让星际舰队全面介入
I will unleash the full weight of Starfleet

318
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,108
这次行动
on this whole operotion.

319
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,319
拜托 我们说的可是个把超级武器卖给
Oy, we're talking about a bloke who's selling superweapons

320
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,321
任何有拉锡姆卡的三流恐怖分子的家伙
to any third- rate terrorist with a Lotinum card.

321
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,156
听好了 废品佬
GARRETT: Listen carefully, Junkyard.

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,117
星际舰队不做暗杀
Starfleet does not do assassinotions.

323
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,787
得了 别把你的主要指令搞得一团乱
Ay, don't get your prime directives in α bunch.

324
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,122
你不会弄脏自己的手
You are not going to get your hands dirty

325
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,249
破坏自己成为舰长的机会
αnd mess up your chances of becoming captain.

326
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,793
我可是顶尖的科学官
I'm αtop- tier science officer.

327
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,878
蛮横的家伙 死板鬼
Butt pretzel. - : Tight- ass.

328
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,755
真没礼貌
So disrespectful.

329
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,882
等加勒特和弗兹切断那个连接…
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz sever that link.

330
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,012
他就会被我们控制 我会在泽夫的帮助下
...he'll be under our control, and I'll take him down

331
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,432
制服他 嗯
with the help of Zeph. - Mm.

332
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,106
这才叫打击 一个
That's what I callαhit. - One.

333
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,233
在买家到达巴拉姆之前
Dada Noe and his pathogen will be in custody

334
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,069
达达·诺伊和他的病原体就会被捕
before the buyers cqn even show up to the Baraam.

335
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,321
我们进去又出来
And we are in nd out.

336
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
嗯 不过…
Mm. Meh.

337
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,326
不过
OTHERS: Meh?

338
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,453
我有个更简单的主意
I have o simpler idea.

339
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:15,013
欢迎 诺伊先生
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

340
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,807
很荣幸您光临巴拉姆
We're honored to have you here at the Bqraam.

341
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,685
我是维罗妮克·杜弗朗克 这里的主人
I am Veronique du Franc, the proprietor.

342
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,687
我说过要准备好我的套房
I told them to have my suite ready.

343
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:23,896
当然 先生
Mais oui, monsieur.

344
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,232
让我带您去房间
May lescort you to your quarters?

345
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,692
来吧
Come.

346
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,029
我们有最精致的…
We have the most exquisite

347
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,613
我不敢相信你会相信这个反社会者
I can't believe you're trusting this sociopath.

348
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,115
好吧 中尉
ALOK: Well, Lieutenant,

349
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,408
你得做该做的事
you got to do what you got to do,

350
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,534
而我对反社会者还挺熟悉的
αnd l'm kind of familiar with sociopaths.

351
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,870
我说过不要带我来
I said don't bring me.

352
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,374
希望您一路顺风 先生
I trust your trip was without incident, monsieur.

353
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,669
你们的人确实把一切都安排得很妥当
Well, your people made everything easy.

354
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,297
这是我们的荣幸 到了
Our pleasure. Here we are.

355
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,972
真俗气
So tacky.

356
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,725
不过这就是你的风格
But I guess that's what you're known for.

357
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,023
这是什么
What's this?

358
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,399
这叫相位舱
It's called α phase pod.

359
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,027
我的一个客户送给我的
A client of mine gave it to me as a gift,

360
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,446
我也给自己弄了一个
αnd I got one for myself, too.

361
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,707
你在干什么
What are you doing?

362
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,375
宇宙中的一切都以
Everything in the universe vibrates

363
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,960
特定的波长振动
- on αcertain wavelength. -

364
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,378
该死
Damn it.

365
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,882
把箱子还给我
Give me back my case.

366
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,383
不
No.

367
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,471
这要从你的安全押金里扣除
That's coming out of your security deposit.

368
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,390
相位舱会改变
The phase pod changes the wavelength

369
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,059
它们接触物体的波长
of whatever they touch.

370
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,312
我与你相位不同 你也与我相位不同
I am out of phase with you, and you're out of phase with me.

371
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,525
但我与你的箱子相位相同
Iαm, however, in phase with your case.

372
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,238
我要把它带走
And I will be taking it with me.

373
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:59,117
你不知道你惹上了什么麻烦
You have no idea what you've started.

374
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,995
糟糕了
Whoopsie.

375
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,877
令人印象深刻
lmpressive.

376
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,462
你确定你是人类吗
Are you sure you're human?

377
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,589
大多数时候是
Most days.

378
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,258
谢谢
Thank you.

379
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,002
把箱子给我
Give me the case.

380
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,368
你是谁
Who are you?

381
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,298
他往那边跑了 那边 那边 那边 那边
He went that way. That way, that woy, that way, that way!

382
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,852
天啊 是外星人
Oh, aliens.

383
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,437
-赤身裸体的外星人 -快追 泽夫
- Nαked αliens. - ALOK: Go, Zeph, go.

384
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,709
他朝休息室去了 天哪 他们跑得真快
He's headed to the lounge. Man, they're moving fast.

385
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,461
梅勒 他朝你那边去了
: Melle, he's coming to you.

386
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,215
天啊
Yikes.

387
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,976
没事
No, it's okoy.

388
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,560
-我没事 -梅勒 抓到他了吗
- l'm all right. - Melle, you got him?

389
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,729
抓到了
Got him.

390
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,899
哇喔
Ooh- la- la!

391
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,609
天啊
Ay, amor.

392
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,366
这不可能
That's not possible.

393
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,909
我明明销毁了它
I had that destroyed.

394
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,161
不 不
No. No!

395
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,665
这不可能
lt's not possible.

396
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,208
你认识那件武器
ALOK: You knew that weapon.

397
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,252
那是什么
What is it?

398
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,755
那是什么
What is it?

399
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,593
好吧 那就来硬的
Fine. The hard way.

400
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,420
永恒祈求者请求觐见
MAN: The Eternal Supplicant begs opproach.

401
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,797
准予觐见
You have my permission.

402
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,599
至高无上的陛下
AlI hail Her Most Imperial Majesty,

403
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:57,933
祖国之母
Mother of the Fatherland,

404
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,102
-火山星的统治者 -什么事
Overlord of Vulc- What is it?

405
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,105
已经完成了 陛下
lt is finished, Your Majesty.

406
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,818
我的工程师们呢
Where are my engineers?

407
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,699
他们…完工后就自尽了
: They...they took their own lives upon completion.

408
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,332
桑 你为谁而哭
Who is the tear for, San?

409
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,294
说
Speak.

410
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,506
为您而哭 陛下
lt is for you, Majesty.

411
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,550
这一切都是…
lt is oll

412
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,346
为了您
for you.

413
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,024
我问你 桑
I αsked you α question, San.

414
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,486
你为何为我哭泣
Why do you cry for me?

415
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,824
看着我
Look ot me.

416
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:03,499
你还记得我们是谁吗
Do you remember who we were?

417
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,669
在这一切之前
Before oll this.

418
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,588
那个求知若渴的男孩
The curious boy.

419
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,383
那个天真无邪的女孩
The innocent girl.

420
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,594
我只记得我的失败 陛下
I only remember my failure, Majesty.

421
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,681
别对我撒谎
Don't lie to me.

422
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,435
只有我们能理解
We were the only ones who could understand

423
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,939
活下去需要付出的代价
the cost to stay alive.

424
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,692
我们是一个团队
We made o team.

425
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:33,195
我们互相需要 不是吗
We needed each other, didn't we?

426
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,116
为了一起活下去
What did we say to carry each other through,

427
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,326
我们说过什么
to survive together?

428
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,161
我们是二…
We are two.

429
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,582
为一体
SAN: But one.

430
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,209
我们是二为一体
BOTH: We are two but one.

431
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,378
如果那时我说
If I said then,

432
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,879
”让我们逃走吧
"Let's run away,

433
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,423
逃离这场竞争
"let's flee this competition

434
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,676
逃离一切束缚我们的地球”
and everything that binds us to Terra, "

435
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:58,053
你会说什么
what would you have said?

436
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,555
嗯
Hmm?

437
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,436
您这个问题的时机比您想象的更富诗意
The timing of your question is more poetic than you know.

438
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,774
那时的我会说好
I would have said yes.

439
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,074
那时
Then.

440
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,828
但现在呢
But now?

441
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:29,251
您本可以缔造一个美好的统治
You could have made something beautiful with your reign.

442
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,962
但您却选择建造这个
lnstead, you chose to build this.

443
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,007
这意味着我认识的那个
That means that innocent girl I knew,

444
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,593
天真无邪的女孩
she hqs been...

445
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,470
已经…死了
: ...murdered.

446
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,640
这是什么
What is this?

447
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,559
你…
You......

448
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,395
你也服了同样的毒
You took the same poison?

449
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,566
不 我不允许你死
No! I forbid you to die!

450
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,611
没有人愿意活在
No one wants to live

451
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,156
您的世界里 皇帝陛下
in your world, Emperor.

452
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,326
您是个暴君
You ore a monster!

453
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,940
这又是什么好地方
GEORGIOU: And what delightful place is this?

454
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,358
安全屋
ALOK: A safe house.

455
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,236
但对你来说可能不太安全
But maybe not so safe for you.

456
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,654
你是31区的人
You are Section 31.

457
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,324
为什么不用刑逼我说出答案
Why aren't you torturing answers out of me?

458
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,659
你是个暴君
You're a tyrant.

459
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,035
真正的暴君
A real one.

460
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,537
刑讯对你没用
Torture wouldn't work.

461
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,957
你为什么如此了解像我这样的人
How do you know so much about people like me?

462
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,458
嗯
Hmm?

463
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:55,671
你也曾经历过暴政 而且记忆深刻
You learned tyranny somewhere, and you learned hard.

464
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:59,049
如果你要隐藏这点 就是软弱
If you have to hide it, that's a weakness.

465
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,096
而我的搭档不能软弱
And I can't have thot in o partner.

466
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,348
-我们不是搭档 -不是吗
- We're not partners. - No?

467
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,225
我帮了很大忙
I've been very helpful.

468
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,060
你的计划本行不通
You had a plan that couldn't work.

469
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,353
我给了你更好的方案
I gave you α better one.

470
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,814
让你尝到了行动的滋味
You gave me a tqste of the action,

471
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,733
知道你会想要更多
knowing I'd want more.

472
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,861
你需要我
You need me.

473
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,238
你选择了我
You chose me.

474
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,283
为什么
Why?

475
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,577
不管你以为你的任务是什么
Whatever you believed your mission was,

476
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,620
情况比你想象的更糟
it's worse than you thought.

477
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:33,083
数十亿人命危在旦夕 时间紧迫
Blllions of lives are at stake, and time is short.

478
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:37,087
你说你的故事 我就说我的
Tell me you, and I will tell you me.

479
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,506
这件事要成功 我必须
The only way this works is if I know

480
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,802
完全了解我在和谁打交道
exactly who I'm dealing with.

481
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,608
我也不是这个时代的人
I'm not from this time, either.

482
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,069
我生于20世纪的地球
I was born on Earth, 20th century.

483
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,656
你有350岁了
You are 350 years old?

484
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,074
差不多吧
More or less.

485
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,619
我沉睡了大部分时间
I slept most of that time.

486
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,580
在我被流放后
After my exile.

487
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,585
优生战争时期
The Eugenics Wars.

488
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,758
强化人…
Augments.

489
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,510
夺走了我的星球
took my planet.

490
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,805
我的家园
My home.

491
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,146
当时我们只有十来个人在战斗
There was maybe ten of us who fought.

492
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,733
我认识的人要么中弹要么被砍死
Everyone I knew either took a bullet or a blade.

493
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,985
但我也杀了不少敌人
But I gave some back.

494
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,489
她注意到了我
She noticed me.

495
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,868
那个屠杀我家人的改造人
The Augment who slaughtered my family.

496
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,957
他们称她为”有印记的吉里”
They called her Giri the Morked.

497
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,917
她收留了我
She took me in.

498
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,128
让我变得比常人更强大
Made me stronger than any human should be.

499
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,672
她把我撕碎
She ripped me opart

500
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:05,259
改造成她军队里的另一个改造人
and turned me into another Augment for her army.

501
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,345
我做了很多可怕的事
And I did terrible things.

502
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,766
都是为了像你这样的魔头
AlI for a monster like you.

503
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:19,147
因为对暴君来说 只有一个选择
Because for tyrants, there is only one choice:

504
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,567
杀戮
murder.

505
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,195
你还没有杀我
You haven't killed me.

506
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,656
暂时没有
Yet.

507
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:38,709
我认出了那件武器 因为是我下令制造的
I recognized the weapon because I ordered it to be built.

508
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,504
召集你的人
Gather your people.

509
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,173
我们需要所有人手
We're gonna need every one of them.

510
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,546
在我的宇宙里 总有人在密谋
GEORGIOU: In my universe, there were always plotters.

511
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,214
总有政变
Always a coup.

512
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:30,385
所以我打造了一件武器来消灭所有威胁
So I built a weapon to end all threots.

513
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,222
我称它为天赐
I called it the Godsend.

514
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,934
它会引发连锁反应
It triggers a chain reaction,

515
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,561
像病毒一样在行星间传播
like a virus passing between planets.

516
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,314
所经之处 尽成灰烬
Everything in its poth incinerates.

517
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,900
整个象限都会毁灭
An entire quadrant would be lost.

518
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,277
如果我的敌人设法杀死我
If my enemies managed to kill me,

519
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,447
就再无统治的土地
there would be nothing left to rule.

520
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,242
呃 打扰一下 问个问题
ZEPH: Yeah, hi. Quick question.

521
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,619
抱歉
Sorry.

522
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,579
对 就是 呃 就一个小问题
Yeah, no. Uh, justαqu it's just a quick one.

523
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,249
是天赐还是天谴？
Is it Godsend or God's End?

524
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,293
天赐还是天谴？
Godsend or God's End?

525
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:04,670
我听不出你说的有什么区别
I don't hearα difference in what you're saying.

526
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:08,090
真的吗？真的吗？天赐 天谴
Really? Really? Godsend. God's End.

527
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,384
-我还是听不出来 -天赐是…
Yeah, I'm still not getting it. - The Godsend is...

528
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,843
等等 天赐 我现在听出来了
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

529
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,804
-是天赐 没有谴字 -赐
lt's Godsend. No apostrophe. Send.

530
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,472
天赐就在这里
The Godsend is here.

531
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,766
怎么可能？它来自另一个宇宙
How? lt's from another universe.

532
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,518
我不知道 但那个人有它
I don't know, but that man had it.

533
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,311
就是你认为是达达诺的人
The one that you think is Dada Noe.

534
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,271
我们知道他就是达达诺
The one we know is Dada Noe.

535
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,400
不 他不是你们的达达诺 不可能是
No, he's not your Dada Noe. He cqn't be.

536
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,361
他来自帝联 而且带来了天赐
He's from the Terran Empire, and he brought the Godsend here.

537
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,656
这是他知道天赐的唯一原因
That's the only way he can know about it.

538
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,157
既然我们已经把他关起来了
And since we have him locked up tight,

539
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,993
-我来审问他 -不 不 不
- I'II interrogate him. GARRETT: No, no, no.

540
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,370
-我们不能相信这个女人说的任何话 -对
We cannot trust a single word this woman says. Yeah.

541
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,871
她害死了梅勒
She cost us Melle.

542
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,832
她是唯一知道我们在对付什么的人
She's the only one who knows what we're dealing with.

543
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,792
是啊 这是她说的 小弟
Yeah, well, so she says, little bro.

544
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,210
小？
Little? -

545
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,920
歧视我们小个子！
Scale- shamer!

546
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,672
微生物比恐龙活得久！
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

547
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,340
冷静点 我是说…
Calm your boots. What I'm saying is...

548
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,719
我要尿你一身 让你生锈！
I will piss in your suit until you go all rusty like!

549
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,387
...她才是搞砸一切的原因
...that she's the reason this is dll bollixed up.

550
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,347
梅勒死是因为她 我们在银河系屁股眼
She's the reason Melle's dead, and she's the reason

551
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
也是因为她
we're in the ass end of the galaxy.

552
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,017
都听着
ALOK: Listen up.

553
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,813
我和乔治欧要回船上去
Georgiou and I are gonna go back to the ship.

554
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,233
达达诺是我们找到天赐的唯一线索
Dada Noe is our only link to the Godsend,

555
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,319
所以我们要和他谈谈
so we're gonna have a little chat with him.

556
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,042
怎么了？
What?

557
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,085
她是菲利帕·乔治欧
ALOK: Her name is Philippα Georgiou,

558
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,879
至高无上的帝国陛下
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

559
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,756
祖国之母
Mother of the Fatherland.

560
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,090
瓦肯的统治者
Overlord of Vulcan.

561
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,509
克林贡的主宰 安多星的女王
Dominus of Qo'noS, Reginα Andor,

562
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,096
菲利帕·乔治欧·奥古斯都·雅波尼乌斯·森塔利乌斯
Philippa Georgiou Augustus laponius Centarius.

563
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,222
厉害
DADA NOE: Cool.

564
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,515
还送薯条吗？
That come with fries?

565
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,934
不错吧？
: That was good, right?

566
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,188
好吧
Okay.

567
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,149
每次你不直接回答她的问题
ALOK: Every time you don't answer her questions directly,

568
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,277
陛下就会打你的脸
Her Majesty will punch you in your face.

569
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,237
好吧
: Fine.

570
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,156
我是达达
I'm Doda.

571
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,325
达达诺 就是达达 然后是诺
Dadα Noe. just Dada, then Noe.

572
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,743
就这样 中间没别的
That's it. No in- betweens.

573
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,120
然后我...
And l, uh.

574
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,541
我以前在瓦特殖民地管理一个病理实验室
I used to run α pathology lab in the Watt Colonies.

575
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,799
搞什么鬼啊？！
What the shit, man? !

576
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,927
你说她会打我脸的！
You said that she was gonna be doing the face punching!

577
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,430
现在我们都说谎了 你不是那个达达
So now we both have lied. You are not that Doda.

578
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,267
你是他们所说的镜像
You're what these people call his Mirror.

579
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,063
你来自帝联
You came here from the Terran Empire,

580
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,482
带来了天赐
and you brought the Godsend.

581
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,234
什么是天赐？
What's the Godsend?

582
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,946
我的战争委员会想要废黜我
My own war council tried to depose me.

583
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:39,282
你知道我是怎么让元帅开口的吗？
Do you know how I convinced the field marshal to talk?

584
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,201
嗯？
Hmm?

585
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,334
我是帝国武器设施
I was an administrator

586
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,253
的一名行政官员
αt an Imperial weapons facility on Terra.

587
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,629
嗯对
Uh, yeah.

588
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,258
天赐就存放在我的设施里
The Godsend was stored at my facility.

589
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,054
大多数人以为它只是个传说 但我知道它是真的
Most thought it was a legend, but I knew it was real.

590
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,764
所以你想把它卖掉
So you tried to sell it.

591
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,182
对 对
DADA NOE: Yeah, yeah.

592
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,769
我想靠卖它的钱在这里安静地生活
I wanted to Iive here quietly on its proceeds.

593
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,604
你是怎么来到我们的宇宙的？
ALOK: How did you get to our universe?

594
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,022
嗯？
Hmm?

595
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,569
有一场离子风暴
There was an ion storm.

596
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,612
实际上是两场
Two of them, actually.

597
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,157
当它们按规律汇聚时
And when they converged, which they do like clockwork,

598
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,410
在帝国边缘撕开了什么东西－
they ripped something open on the fringes of the Empire- -

599
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:28,123
他们称之为异象 但其实是一条通道
αn anomaly, they called it- but it was a passageway

600
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,168
可以从帝联到达这个地方
to get to this place from the Terran Empire.

601
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,339
它通向你们的新月星云
Comes out through your Crescent Nebula.

602
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,633
知道的人很少 暂时是这样
Few know obout it. For now.

603
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,469
但它四小时后会再次打开
But it'll open again in four hours.

604
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,139
那时我本该和买家见面
That's when I was supposed to be meeting my buyer.

605
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,099
你知道那武器会造成什么后果吗？
Are you aware of what that weapon does?

606
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,643
帝联已经耗尽了资源
The Terran Empire's burned through its resources.

607
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:49,853
到处都是饥荒
There's famine.

608
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,522
整个生态系统都在崩溃
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

609
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,941
他们需要找到新的领地
They need to find a new territory

610
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,693
来征服和掠夺
to conquer and strip- mine.

611
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,237
当他们发现超级武器不见了
When they realize that their superweapon is gone,

612
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,989
他们就会找到那条通道
they're gonna find that passageway- -

613
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,699
你知道他们一定会的
you know they will and they'll come

614
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,328
他们会烧毁一切 奴役幸存者
αnd they'll burn everything they touch and enslave the rest,

615
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,539
陛下 这就是帝国的作风
because that's what the Empire does, Majesty.

616
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,210
他们都是跟你学的
: They learned well from you.

617
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,463
还有谁想要它
ALOK: Who else wants it?

618
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,548
我不知道 老兄
DADA NOE: I- I don't know, man.

619
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,926
我收到了报价 钱是真的
I got an offer. The money was real.

620
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,178
有人从我们这偷走了天赐武器
Someone stole the Godsend from us.

621
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,263
他是谁 不知道
- Who was he? - DADA NOE: No idea.

622
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,642
不管是谁闯入我的房间 偷走了武器
Whoever broke into my room, whoever stole that weapon,

623
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,518
他们之所以知道这些
they know what they know because they learned it

624
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:32,187
是从你们中的某个人那学来的
from one of you.

625
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,459
紧急传送器
ALOK: Emergency transporter.

626
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,245
好吧 这很棒
Well, this is great.

627
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,622
哦 更妙了
Oh, even better.

628
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:35,000
那是…那是飞船吗 飞船不见了吗
ZEPH: Is that...is that the ship? Is the ship gone?

629
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,293
我喜欢那艘船
I liked that ship.

630
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,128
发生什么事了
What hoppened?

631
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,963
破坏行动
Sabotage.

632
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,551
什么
What?

633
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,137
偷走天赐武器的人有个帮手
GEORGIOU: Whoever stole the Godsend had a partner.

634
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,639
就在这里
lt was someone here.

635
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,977
这意味着我们中间有个内鬼
Which means one of us is a mole.

636
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,776
可能是你 也可能是你
Could be you. Could be you.

637
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,194
如果是我
GEORGIOU: If it were me,

638
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,447
你们早就都死了
I would have murdered all of you already.

639
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,907
老大 如果有内鬼 你知道不是我
Look, boss, if there's a mole, you know it's not me.

640
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,909
这话听起来就像内鬼会说的
ZEPH: I meαn, that sounds pretty moley to me.

641
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,494
我不知道
- I don'tknow.

642
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,246
我们一起执行过十次任务了
QUASI: We've been on like ten ops together.

643
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,040
是啊 我连你长什么样都不知道
Yeah, andI still don't even know what you look like, do I?

644
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,958
没人知道变形者的本来面目
No one knows what a Chameloid looks like.

645
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,919
你可以变成任何样子 那弗兹呢
- You might change into anything you want. - What about Fuzz, huh?

646
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,963
他和我们完全不是一个量级的 转移话题了
He exists on α whole other scale than anybody else. - Mm, deflecting?

647
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:25,425
我老婆快要产下我们的第一窝卵囊了
My wife is about to Iay our first litter of egg sacs.

648
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,595
不 我即将有19万个幼崽 等等等等
No, Ihave190, 000 hatchlings on the way- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

649
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,263
我希望它们能活下来 听着
...and I want them to live. Well, look,

650
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,765
你能给我们每个人都找到动机
you could find α motive for any of us.

651
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,517
也可能是我们中任意几个人联手
Or it could be a combination of any of you.

652
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,478
比如说泽夫和弗兹或者…
You know, like- like Zeph and- and Fuzz or...

653
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,063
没有梅勒你就乱了分寸
You are spinning out without Melle.

654
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,731
你无法做出决定
You cannot land on a choice.

655
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,858
也许你说这话是因为你就是内鬼
Maybe you're putting that in my head because you're the mole.

656
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,485
嗯 加勒特怎么样 她是新人
Huh? How obout Garrett? She's new.

657
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,694
她根本不在意我们
She doesn't care obout us.

658
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,196
我是星际舰队的人
I'm Starfleet.

659
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,908
哇 刚才有谁感觉到英雄气息
Whoa. Anyone else feel that heroic breeze right there

660
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,326
吹动她的斗篷了吗
ruffling her cape?

661
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,620
好吧 那边有艘旧船
GARRETT: Okαy, there's an old ship out there,

662
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,954
一艘废弃的运输船
αn old garbage scow.

663
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,664
是的 当你在上面
Yeah, Ifound it when you were up there

664
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,249
审问铁头的时候我发现的
interrogating metal head.

665
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,751
虽然多年没人驾驶了
Must be years since anyone flew it,

666
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,127
但我觉得我们可以用它
but I think we can work with it

667
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,838
去追那个偷走天赐武器的人
to go after whoever took the Godsend.

668
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,299
嗯 我对你的厌恶减轻了
Mm. Idislike you less.

669
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,717
啊
Aw.

670
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,344
想让人喜欢我 我会养条狗
If I wanted someone to like me, I'd get α dog.

671
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,595
我喜欢秩序
I like order.

672
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,056
我喜欢可预测性和结局
I like prediction and conclusion.

673
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,268
那你找错队伍了 因为我们这有内鬼
Then you're on the wrong team because we've got mole,

674
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,437
被困在一个死寂的星球上
stranded on a dead planet,

675
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,147
无法与外界联系
no communication with the outside,

676
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,026
不到四小时泰伦人就能得到天赐武器
and less than four hours before the Terrans get the Godsend

677
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,028
他们可以在银河系任何地方使用它
and use it anywhere in the galaxy.

678
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:30,865
说到这个奎斯 天线阵列怎么样
Speaking of which, Quas, what about the antenna array?

679
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,035
呃 这个…
Uh, well

680
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,080
它已经过时二十年了
Well, it's a couple decades out of date.

681
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,291
我们得让它运转起来 然后通知31部门即将发生的事
We get it up and running, then we tell 31 what's coming.

682
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,584
我们一起行动
We work together.

683
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,753
所有人都要保持在视线范围内 好的
Everyone stoys in sight. - QUASI: Yeah.

684
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,755
就是…
just.

685
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,219
我们走吧
Let's go.

686
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,485
好吧 这个主意泡汤了
QUASI: Well, there goes that idea.

687
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,822
我们的小内鬼真是忙个不停
Our little mole has been really busy.

688
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,532
把所有线路都破坏了
Ripped up all the wiring.

689
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,409
分两队 我带一队进树林
Two teams. I'll Iead one into the woods.

690
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,786
三个人去看看能否修好那艘破船
Three to see if we can salvage that scow.

691
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,079
你和其他人留在这
You stay here with the others

692
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,664
试着修复天线阵列
αnd try and fix the antenna array.

693
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,916
她凭什么现在给我们下命令
Why is she giving us orders now?

694
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,376
因为我允许她这么做
Because I'm Ietting her

695
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,086
而且我很确定她不是内鬼
αnd l'm pretty certain she's not the mole.

696
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:26,796
你不会押注在一匹叫”很确定”的马上
You wouldn't bet on a horse named Pretty Certain.

697
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,842
奎斯 弗兹 你们马上和乔治欧去检查那艘船
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow right away with Georgiou.

698
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,635
泽夫和加勒特留在这里和我一起
Zeph and Garrett, you stay here with me.

699
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,220
我们负责天线阵列
We'll take care of the antenna array.

700
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,139
呃 抱歉
Uh, I'm sorry.

701
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,640
我要和两个想杀我的人
I'm supposed to go out into the woods

702
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,350
一起去树林里
with two people who want to kill me?

703
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,686
保持在彼此视线范围内 别死就行
Just stay in sight of each other and don't get dead.

704
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,104
好吗
Okay?

705
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,856
好的 谢谢队长
QUASI: Yep, thanks, Cap.

706
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,900
我是说 只有一半概率其中一个想杀我
I mean, just fifty- fifty shot one of them wants to kill me,

707
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,235
然后25%... 奎斯 赶紧滚出去
and then 25‰Quas, just get your ass out there.

708
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,487
我也爱你 队长
Ilove you, too, Cop.

709
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,447
好了 遵命
ALOK: AII righty. QUASI: Aye, aye.

710
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,959
这艘破船的内部线路
QUASI: The internal circuitry on this old scow

711
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,337
状况还算不错
is still in decent shape.

712
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,675
我看到的部件都能用
Everything I'm seeing should work.

713
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:17,847
所以这个我们在追的东西 天赐武器
So this thing we're chasing, the Godsend,

714
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,975
你们的工程师有没有装保险装置
your engineers, did they install a fail- safe?

715
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,144
我们能远程禁用它吗
Can we disable it remotely?

716
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,399
没有失控保护 我不会允许这种东西
There is no fail- safe. I wouldn't allow it.

717
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,693
这很符合你的风格
How very on- brand for you.

718
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,111
我能再问一个问题吗
Can I ask you one more question?

719
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,280
我就再问最后一个
I'mjust gonna ask you one more question.

720
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,824
你把神赐带到这个世界上
So you brought the Godsend into the world

721
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,036
就为了消灭亿万生命
to vaporize quadrillions of lives.

722
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:43,915
从没觉得这有点 你懂的 过分吗
Never thought that was a little, you know, much?

723
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,628
我下令销毁了它
I ordered it destroyed.

724
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:52,799
有人藏起来了 你的人背叛了你
And someone hid it. Your own people betrayed you.

725
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,176
你的企业文化烂透了
Well, your corporate culture was straight- up shit.

726
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,387
而且你还没回答我的问题
And you didn't answer my question.

727
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,889
渐近线线圈不见了
The asymptote coil is gone.

728
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:04,060
有人一定是为了铽把它拆走了
Someone must have scavenged it for the terbium.

729
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,105
找另一个这东西应该能飞
Well, find another one, this thing should fly.

730
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,607
-货舱里可能有 -不行
Mαybe the cargo hull. Huh. Oh, no, no.

731
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,443
所有人要在一起 明白吗
Everyone stays together, all right?

732
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,280
这样你就没机会杀我们了
Limits the possibilities of you killing us.

733
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,198
呃…
Uh.

734
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,117
我们去货舱看看
Let's go to the cargo hold, please.

735
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,910
你不来吗
Aren't you coming?

736
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,913
来 我可太期待了
Yes. Icouldn't be more excited.

737
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,168
我当然可以帮你
ZEPH: Yeah, Icould help you down there, of course,

738
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,546
但是考虑到你知道 控制欲
but considering how, you know, control

739
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,548
是你性格的核心
is central to your entire identity

740
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,550
而我又不擅长这个
αnd the fact that I'm just not good atit,

741
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,094
我就站在这里 尊重我们的关系
I'mjust gonna stand here and honor our relationship

742
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,471
-什么都不做 -很有帮助
by doing absolutely nothing. ALOK: Helpful.

743
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,181
这叫彻底的自我接纳
It's called radical self- acceptance.

744
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,683
-你很开明嘛 -谢谢
Evolved of you. Well, thank you.

745
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,268
你能修好吗
So, can you fix it?

746
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:49,230
我都不确定它是不是坏了 只是缺了个零件
I'm not even sure it's broken. lt's just missing a part.

747
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,524
你看 这些断裂的线路看着吓人
Look, this- this torn wiring Iooks dramatic,

748
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,443
但这设备有备用系统
but this equipment has redundancy built in.

749
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,944
有简单的替代方案
There's an easy work- around.

750
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,531
但theta接口被人扯掉了
Except somebody ripped out the thetq junction.

751
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,283
除此之外 这东西应该能用
Other than that, this thing should work.

752
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,411
那也许内鬼拿着它
Okay, well, maybe our mole has it.

753
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,460
-加勒特？ -嗯
Gαrrett? - Yeah.

754
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,753
泽夫
Zeph.

755
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,796
泽夫在哪
Where is Zeph?

756
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,306
泽夫 收到请回复
Zeph, come in.

757
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,434
泽夫 听到请回话
Zeph, do you copy?

758
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,943
泽夫
Zeph.

759
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,869
加勒特 是你弄的吗
Garrett, was that you?

760
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,416
加勒特 那是什么声音
Garrett, what the hell was that?

761
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,460
有人启动了天线阵列
GARRETT: Someone just αctivated the antenno array.

762
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,420
该死
Damn it.

763
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,798
发生什么事了
What's happening?

764
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,300
加勒特 汇报情况
Garrett, sitrep.

765
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,636
这下有好戏看了
FUZZ: This is going to be good.

766
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,597
中尉 收到请回复 完毕
ALOK: Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

767
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,815
安全
QUASI: Clear.

768
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,401
安全
GEORGIOU: Clear.

769
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,902
这里没有
FUZZ: Nothing here.

770
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,446
怎么可能有人用这个发送信号
How could someone have used this to send out α signal?

771
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,657
不可能 它缺了个零件
lmpossible. lt's missing a part.

772
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,034
而且被人打坏了
And someone shot it to hell.

773
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
我听到有人在跑
GARRETT: I heard someone running.

774
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,038
泽夫一定是把theta接口装回去了
Zeph must have put the thetq junction back in.

775
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,457
用完天线阵列后又打坏了它
Then shot it after he used the array.

776
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,338
他失踪后一定是绕回来了
So he must hove circled back after he went AWOL.

777
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:41,676
泽夫来这个星球就是为了破坏我们的行动
Zeph came down to this planet to sabotage us.

778
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,553
现在我们被困在这里
And now that we're stranded,

779
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,180
他给他的同伙发了信息
he sent α message to whoever he's working with.

780
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,182
他会躲起来等援军到了
And he'll lay low until his ride gets here,

781
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,934
然后就跑得无影无踪
αnd then he's long gone.

782
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,520
那我们得先找到他
GEORGIOU: Then we need to find him first.

783
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:02,155
观察手 收到请回复
ALOK: Observer, do you copy?

784
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,824
突击一号 我什么时候没收到过
GARRETT: Please, Raider One, when do I not copy?

785
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:07,034
有意思 情况如何
That's funny. Status?

786
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,621
这里干扰很大
GARRETT: I'm picking up a lot of interference,

787
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,415
但三录仪显示泽夫的生命特征
but the tricorder shows Zeph's biosignature

788
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,709
刚刚出现在这个区域 完毕
was just in this sector. Over.

789
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,755
收到 保持隐蔽 跟紧点
Copy. Stay low and tight, people.

790
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,678
你效忠的军阀吉里 她怎么了
The warlord you served, Giri, what happened to her?

791
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,764
她死得跟活着一样
She died like she lived.

792
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,891
你知道我什么意思
By that, you know what I mean.

793
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,184
她很幸运
She was lucky.

794
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,269
没被良心感染
She wasn't infected with a conscience.

795
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,687
-感染？-对
lnfected? - Yeah.

796
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,939
怪物就该是怪物
A monster can only be a monster.

797
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:40,193
有悔意的怪物毫无用处
A monster with regrets is useless.

798
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,778
所以你才躲在
Mm. So that's why you were hiding

799
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,613
那个鸟不生蛋的酒吧里
in α bar ot the ass end of nowhere.

800
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,032
也许这就是你为什么要跟31部门合作
Maybe it's why you're working with 31.

801
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,784
为了洗清自己
To wipe your slate clean.

802
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,328
像我们这样的人总要付出代价
ALOK: There's always α price to pay for people like us.

803
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,330
你在这里就说明你也同意
You wouldn't be here if you didn't agree.

804
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,207
原来你是这么看我的
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

805
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,918
你觉得我是个有感情能被控制的怪物
You think I'm a monster who feels enough to be controlled

806
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,753
但还能干脏活
but still do the real dirty work.

807
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,172
不我觉得你想要回神赐是因为你知道
No, I think you want the Godsend back because you know

808
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,799
这是你唯一的机会
it's your one chance to redeem yourself

809
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,425
弥补你的罪过
for all the shit you've done.

810
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,261
我要回神赐是因为它是我的
I want the Godsend bock because it's mine.

811
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,772
啊 泽夫的外骨骼在漏水
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton is Ieaking.

812
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,655
对越来越多了
Yep, more.

813
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,161
这边
GEORGIOU: This way.

814
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,571
布利普 克利普
Blip, Clip,

格利普
Grip,

00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,826
小儿麻痹 流行感冒
Polio, lnfluensina,

817
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,870
-牛痘… -你在说什么
- Cowpox...- What are you saying?

818
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,789
我在给我的孩子们起名字
I'm reciting the names of me hatchlings.

819
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,708
既然你们中有人要杀我
Since one of you is going to murder me,

820
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,295
我永远见不到他们了 但至少我可以一一纪念他们
I'm never gonna meet them, but αt Ieast I can honor them

821
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,671
每一个
one by one.

822
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,172
崔普
Trip,

823
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,549
崔普2号
Trip 2,

824
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,720
扁桃体炎 克里米亚－刚果出血热…
Tonsilyitis, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever...

825
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,555
你要把19万个名字都哭诉出来吗
Are you gonna sob out 190, 000 names?

826
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,724
你怎么能这么冷血无情
How can you be so cold and insensitive?

827
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,517
他可能记录下发生的事了吗
Might he have recorded what happened?

828
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,019
当然有
QUASI: Sure.

829
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,979
但影像可能和他一起消失了
Except the footage was probably murdered along with him.

830
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,024
我们可以把三录仪连接到他的外骨骼上
ALOK: We could connect one of the tricorders to his suit.

831
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,610
只要还有数据 就能知道凶手是谁
Whatever data is left, we'll know who did this.

832
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,487
你这是在怀疑我们所有人
QUASI: You say that like we're all suspects.

833
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,156
我们不是 好吗
We're not. All right?

834
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:53,701
福兹、我和她当时都在驳船上
Fuzz, me and her were in the scow when all this happened-

835
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,120
大家都在彼此的视线范围内
everyone in sight of everyone else.

836
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,414
而且没人离开过对吧
And nobody went anywhere, right?

837
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,458
-对 -嗯
Right. - GEORGIOU: Hmm.

838
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,631
这不是泽夫的
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

839
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:10,551
黑发25厘米
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

840
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,234
这太疯狂了
This is insane.

841
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,778
别乱动
Stop fidgeting.

842
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,404
我和泽夫一起待了一周
I've been in close quarters with Zeph for a week.

843
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,114
好吧 你喜欢机械性爱
Okay, so you're into mecha boom- boom.

844
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,241
很多人类都这样 没什么好羞耻的
Lots of humans are. No shame.

845
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,286
嗯
Hmm.

846
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,209
这不可能
Well, that's impossible.

847
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,686
加勒特中尉
ALOK: Lieutenant Garrett,

848
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,647
为什么你的指甲下有泽夫的血
why is Zeph's blood underneath your fingernails?

849
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,445
加勒特中尉
GEORGIOU: Lieutenant Garrett,

850
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,323
在泽夫身上发现了你的痕迹
evidence from you was found on Zeph's body,

851
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,326
在你身上也发现了泽夫的痕迹
αnd evidence from Zeph's body was found on you.

852
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,704
一点都不星际舰队
Not very Starfleet.

853
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,455
我非常星际舰队
Oh, Iam very Starfleet.

854
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,041
你知道我没做这事
And you know I didn't do this.

855
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,628
你只是害怕任何有道德准则的人
You are just terrified of anyone with a moral compass.

856
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,921
嗯
Mm.

857
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,842
在那颗纯洁的心底
And deep down in that pure little heart,

858
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,928
你其实是个混乱小妖精 对吧
you're αctuallyα chaos goblin, aren't you?

859
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,472
-我知道你有这潜质 天使 -别这么叫我
- I know you have itin you, angel. - Don't call me that.

860
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:40,099
星际舰队看出了你的本质
Starfleet sniffed you out

861
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,977
把你安排在最有用的位置
αnd put you in a place where you'd be most useful.

862
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:47,398
31区正是那些懂得变通规则的军官该去的地方
Section 31 is just the place for officers who bend the rules,

863
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,651
从不违规 直到他们违规的那一刻
never quite break them until they do.

864
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,488
你在这里很合适
And you fit right in here.

865
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,995
你随便折磨我
GARRETT: You can torture me all you want.

866
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,706
你永远不能把我变成杀人凶手
You will never make me o murderer.

867
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,917
不
ALOK: No.

868
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,641
找到录像了！
QUASI: We've got footage!

869
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,021
住手！
ZEPH: Stop!

870
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,856
住手！
Stop!

871
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,193
这是我的外骨骼
This is my suit.

872
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,528
我就是外骨骼！
I am the suit!

873
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,990
外骨骼就是我！
The suit is me!

874
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,533
等一下
One second.

875
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,665
我们是朋友啊 我们是朋友
We were your friends. We were your friends.

876
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:49,460
你不能杀我
You can't kill me. -

877
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,670
-泽夫 不要 -你不能杀…
QUASI: Zeph, no. You can't kill...

878
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,220
泽夫是自杀的？
QUASI: Zeph killed himself?

879
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,846
他为什么要这么做
Why would he do that?

880
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,268
抱歉让你失望了 陛下
Sorry to disappoint you, Your Majesty.

881
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,522
这一切都说不通
Look, none of this is making any sense.

882
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,940
对 一点都说不通
No, none of it makes a lick of sense.

883
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,608
他为什么要这么做 呃...
Why would he do this? Uh.

884
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,568
-给我几分钟... -我们没时间了
Give me a couple minutes to......- We don't have minutes.

885
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,904
那给我几秒钟
QUASI: Well, then give me a couple seconds, then.

886
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,198
呃…
Uh.

887
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,242
-可能是你 -可能是你
Could be you. GEORGIOU: Could be you.

888
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,827
我甚至还不知道你长什么样
ZEPH: And I still don't even know what you look like.

889
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,578
你可以变成任何样子
You could change into anything you want.

890
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,163
她是新来的她不在乎我们
QUASI: She's new. She doesn't care about us.

891
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,873
-我是星际舰队的 -哇
I'm Starfleet. - Whoa.

892
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,250
说到外骨骼
ZEPH: When you are talking about the suit,

893
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,085
就是在说泽夫
you're talking about Zeph.

894
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,087
这不是福兹
FUZZ: This isn't Fuzz.

895
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,005
瓦肯人只是个机器 你知道的
The Vulcan's just a machine, you know.

896
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,549
我在里面
I'm inside.

897
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,134
歧视鳞片的人！
Scale- shamer!

898
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,761
你想不到我能钻进多小的地方
You wouldn't believe the tiny spots I can get into.

899
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:45,891
比如 身体改造的内部构造
For example, the inner workings of body modifications.

900
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,393
有个自动驾驶
There's an autopilot.

901
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,979
这是唯一合理的解释
That's the only thing that makes sense.

902
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,985
你把瓦肯机器设成了自动驾驶
You set the Vulcan machine on autopilot.

903
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,198
难怪它的反应那么奇怪
That's why its responses were so strange.

904
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,160
-你不来吗 -来了
Aren't you coming? - Yes.

905
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,206
你钻进了泽夫的外骨骼
You flew into Zeph's exoskeleton.

906
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,125
一旦进去之后…
And once you were inside...

907
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,252
有人拆掉了西塔接头
GARRETT: Somebody ripped out the theta junction.

908
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,212
加勒特 泽夫在哪
Garrett, where's Zeph?

909
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,675
然后你控制了泽夫的外骨骼
GEORGIOU: Then you took control of Zeph's suit.

910
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,887
当其他人出去找他的时候
While the others were out Iooking for him,

911
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,598
你让他偷偷回到天线阵列
you made him sneak back into the antenna array

912
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,058
发送了那些信息
αnd send those messages.

913
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,102
别对他们下手！
Don't do this to them!

914
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:32,479
我们曾是朋友啊
We were your friends.

915
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:35,107
然后你就毁掉了证据
GEORGIOU: Then you destroyed the evidence.

916
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,650
还杀了泽夫
And you killed Zeph.

917
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,654
然后把证据栽赃给了加勒特
And then you planted the evidence on Garrett here.

918
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,493
举起手来 费兹
Hands up, Fuzz.

919
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,872
真是见了鬼了
Oh, shite and ever shite.

920
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:59,673
你真要相信她说的话吗 阿洛克？
Whoa. You're honestly gonna believe what she says, Alok?

921
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,592
奎斯 想想我们共同经历的一切
Quasi, after everything we've been through?

922
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,389
我…我能先说一句话吗？
C- Can Ijust say one thing first?

923
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,271
我还能控制泽夫的机甲
I'm still hacked into Zeph's exoskeleton.

924
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,578
快点！
GARRETT: Come on!

925
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,085
”绝不抛弃任何船员”呢？
What happened to"no crew member Ieft behind"?

926
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,546
哦
Oh.

927
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,895
快点 快点！
ALOK: Come on, come on!

928
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,105
靠近点
Get us closer.

929
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,969
我接住你了 我接住你了
QUASI: Igot you. Igot you.

930
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:11,722
该死
Nice and easy. ALOK: Damn.

931
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,574
你一直在关注黑市对吧？
You keep tabs on the black market, hmm?

932
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,493
在那里听说了上天之眼
And that's where you heard about the Godsend.

933
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,869
你在意这个干什么？
Why do you care?

934
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,746
你杀了自己的家人
You killed your family.

935
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,540
再多几十亿人又算什么？
What's a few billion more people, huh?

936
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,418
它在哪里？你在和谁合作？
Where is it? And who are you working with?

937
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:25,295
你就在他们身边十步之遥
You took your crown while they died in agony

938
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,423
看着他们痛苦死去时夺取了王冠
not ten feet away.

939
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:31,385
你把唯一的朋友变成了奴隶
You condemned your only friend to slavery,

940
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,180
最后还厚颜无耻地对他施以仁慈？
and then you had the balls to offer him kindness at the end?

941
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,268
你怎么会知道这些？
How could you know that?

942
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:42,062
终于明白了吧
Glad you're catching on.

943
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:44,022
他骗了你 陛下
He played you, Emperor.

944
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,066
桑还活着
San's alive.

945
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,198
这不可能
lt's not possible.

946
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,785
这怎么可能？
That's not possible. How?

947
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,455
他一点点服用那种毒药
He built up an immunity from that poison, you know.

948
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,749
慢慢建立起了抗体
Teeny tiny doses over time.

949
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:07,379
小人物又赢了一局 陛下
Once again, small shite for the win, mama.

950
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,299
他在哪里？！
Where is he? !

951
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,968
他会给你上一场好戏
He's gonna put on quite the show.

952
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,095
你制造了上天之眼
You built the Godsend.

953
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,972
这个怪物是你一手造就
You made this monster.

954
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,224
这都是你的错
This is all you.

955
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,770
小心点 知道吗？
Be careful, all right?

956
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,397
我说了小心点
I said be careful.

957
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,483
我还要靠这个活动呢
I have to get around in that.

958
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,364
你现在能买上百个这样的了
SAN: You can afford α hundred of them now.

959
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:16,698
哦 太好了
FUZZ: Oh, great.

960
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,867
我只要一个能用的就行
I'd settle for one that works.

961
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,621
所以就是这个？
So that's it?

962
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,248
至高无上的上天之眼
The almighty Godsend.

963
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,624
等你当上皇帝后
When you're emperor,

964
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,337
最好给它换个不那么让人困惑的名字
maybe start by naming it something less confusing.

965
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,143
一旦通道打开
QUASI: Once that passageway opens up,

966
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,772
他就联系地球人 他们就会过来
he contacts the Terrans, they come through.

967
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,317
他们会在这里引爆它
They're detonating it here.

968
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,195
他就成了帝国的宠儿
And he'd be the darling of the Empire.

969
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,073
他会把联邦搞得一团混乱…
So he throws the Federotion into chaos.

970
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,200
星际舰队会手忙脚乱
Starfleet will start scrambling.

971
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,994
正是入侵的好时机
Perfect time to invode.

972
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,582
你创造了这个东西
You gave birth to this thing.

973
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,711
我们做不到
- How do we stop it? - GEORGIOU: We don't.

974
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:13,213
我们被困在这里 追不上他
We're trapped here, so we can't follow him.

975
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,549
天线被毁了 警告不了任何人
The antenna's destroyed, so we can't warn anybody.

976
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,050
这都是借囗
That is bullshit.

977
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,053
我做不到
You can do better than that. - l can't.

978
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,346
上天之眼就是我
The Godsend is me.

979
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:24,641
我永远都战胜不了自己
I'm the only one I could never defeat.

980
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:29,396
过去总会追上你
The past always catches up with you.

981
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,772
对吧？
Right?

982
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,779
但不代表它总能赢
ALOK: Doesn't mean it always wins.

983
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,908
每个安全屋我都有后备计划
Every safe house, I have a backup plan.

984
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:43,535
我们能让那艘垃圾船启动
We'll get that scow running.

985
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,872
老大 那垃圾船飞不起来
Boss, the scow won't fly.

986
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,749
没有渐近线线圈不行
Not without an asymptote coil.

987
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,210
我们有一个
ALOK: We have one.

988
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,129
我们能追上桑
We'll catch up with San.

989
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,548
确保他联系不上地球人
We'll make sure he can't contact the Terrans.

990
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:58,091
你拆了线圈
GARRETT: You ripped out the coil.

991
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,594
有内鬼在时不能告诉你们
Couldn't tell you while a mole was still running around.

992
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:05,432
混蛋
Asshole.

993
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,489
好了 奎斯 启动它
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

994
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:27,663
还是只有一个脉冲
Stil just one pulse.

995
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,461
搞定了
And we're in business.

996
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,589
好了团队 我们只剩不到30分钟了
Okay, team, we have less than 30 minutes.

997
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,216
奎斯 设定航向新月星云
Quas, set a course for the Crescent Nebula.

998
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,427
这会很颠簸 很危险
AII right, this is gonna be bumpy and bad.

999
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,346
我猜桑的船上有武器吧
I'm assuming Sαn's ship will be armed.

1000
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,182
是啊 地球人的船都有武器
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

1001
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,559
他有质子炮 鱼雷
He'll have proton cannons, torpedoes,

1002
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,688
而我们只是艘垃圾船
αnd we are a garbage barge.

1003
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,231
你笑什么？
Why are you laughing?

1004
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,274
因为情况不会更糟了
Because I can't imagine things getting much worse.

1005
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,407
我们走
QUASI: Let's go.

1006
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:16,086
这东西在牵引光束中间飞行
So, this thing flies around in the middle of a tractor field.

1007
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,004
人们把垃圾丢进太空
People jettison their garbage into space,

1008
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,923
垃圾船就在牵引光束里飞行
and the scow flies around and drags the trash

1009
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,174
收集这些垃圾
αlong with the field.

1010
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,136
一旦牵引光束装满了
Once the tractor field is full,

1011
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,887
就把垃圾倒进星云
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

1012
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,723
让辐射把它们分解掉
where it disintegrates in the rodiation.

1013
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,641
我就说明这么多
I just want to be clear.

1014
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,518
你是说我们最好的武器就是
You're saying that our best potential weapon is

1015
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,353
一个收集垃圾的光束？
α beam for collecting garbage?

1016
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,730
-对 -太好了
Yes. Great.

1017
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,566
嘿抱怨可解决不了问题
Hey, being judgy never helped anything.

1018
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,361
-你去哪？-工程部
Where are you going? - Engineering.

1019
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:42,904
既然这是我们唯一的武器
If that's our only weapon,

1020
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,906
我要把所有能量都转到牵引光束上
I'II redirect all power to the tractor beams.

1021
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,033
这主意还不错
That's actually a good plan.

1022
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,389
我们就位了
FUZZ: We're in position.

1023
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,475
通道马上就会打开
The passagewoy will open soon.

1024
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,311
你知道这一切结束后我想要什么吗？
Do you know what I want when this is all over?

1025
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,688
就是一个大空间
Just α big space, you know,

1026
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,483
让我的幼虫能随意打洞和飞翔
for me hatchlings to tunnel and fly around and.

1027
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,568
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1028
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:25,530
我要乔治欧在失败中煎熬
I want Philippa Georgiou to marinate in her own defeat.

1029
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,742
我知道你们是”永世宿敌
I get you guys are all"eternal nemesis,

1030
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,577
性感又邪恶的纠葛”之类的 但是…
sexy evil tension"and stuff, but...

1031
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,995
警报
SHIP COMPUTER: Alert.

1032
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,413
发现来袭舰船
lncoming vessel.

1033
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,333
检测到碰撞轨道
Collision trajectory detected.

1034
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,627
果然她把船弄起来了
Of course she got it off the ground.

1035
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,006
我说我们该用鱼雷
I say we should use the torpedoes.

1036
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,261
他们发现我们了
QUASI: They've picked us up.

1037
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,222
光子鱼雷来袭
GARRETT: Photon torpedo incoming.

1038
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:52,557
-还有五秒四… -现在真该躲开！
Impact in five, fourReally want to take evqsive action right now!

1039
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:56,102
-三 二 一 -夸西保持航向 全力防护罩
...three, two, one. Quas, hold the course. Put everything in our shields.

1040
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,401
她为什么不改变航向？
Why isn't she changing course?

1041
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,028
我又不是算命的
Do I look like a fortune teller?

1042
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,158
牵引光束的能量够用了吗？
ALOK: Do we have enough juice to drag them with the tractor beam yet?

1043
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,993
够了 但我们承受不住再一次直接命中
Yeah, but we can't take another direct hit.

1044
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,830
鱼雷来袭 五 四…
Incoming torpedo in five, four...

1045
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:18,124
-稳住 马上就到了…… -三 二 一
Keep it steady. We're almost there...three, two, one.

1046
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,835
就是现在
ALOK: Now.

1047
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,389
警报 导航控制暂停
SHIP COMPUTER: Alert. Navigation control suspended.

1048
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:35,141
他们想干嘛 把我们拖垮？
What are they gonna do, drag us to death?

1049
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:39,646
她想阻止我回到帝国
SAN: She's trying to stop me from reaching the Empire.

1050
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,189
哦
Oh.

1051
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,194
大家觉得这情况如何？
How's everybody feeling αbout this?

1052
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,404
这是唯一的办法
GEORGIOU: It's the only way.

1053
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,655
这能成功
This can work.

1054
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,532
辐射会削弱他们的防护罩
The radiation will wear down their shields.

1055
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,535
是啊 问题是辐射也会影响到我们
Yeah, the thing is, the radiation hits us, too.

1056
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:58,248
目标锁定故障
SHIP COMPUTER: Target lock malfunction.

1057
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,001
无法锁定鱼雷 炮塔离线
Ican't get torpedo lock. Cannons offline.

1058
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,502
桑？
San?

1059
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,755
桑
San.

1060
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,549
桑！
: San!

1061
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,018
辐射水平已达临界值
SCOW COMPUTER: Rαdiation levels critical.

1062
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:21,229
防护罩已失效 重复 防护罩已失效！
Shields are down. I repeat, shields are down!

1063
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,859
桑的呢？
And San's?

1064
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,694
他的只剩12% 而且还在快速下降
His are at 12% and falling fast.

1065
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:28,987
等离子体来袭！
QUASI: Plasma incoming!

1066
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,447
要是挨上这样一下
We get caught with a burst like that,

1067
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,698
我们就完了
and we're done.

1068
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,034
这太混乱了 加勒特
This is chaos, Garrett.

1069
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,535
你知道你喜欢这样 嗯？
You know you love it, hmm?

1070
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:39,414
也许该接受它 跟它亲热一下
Mqybe let it in, make out with it a little.

1071
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,458
这就是星际舰队派你来这的原因
lt's why Starfleet put you here.

1072
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,293
混乱就是我的炮友
Chaos is my friend with benefits.

1073
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,545
对 加勒特 让我们玩个痛快
Yeαh, Garrett, let's get messy.

1074
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,505
-嗯？ -好啊
Hmm? - Okay.

1075
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,257
-交给你了 夸西 -嗯
You got this, Quas. Uh- huh.

1076
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,550
准备好了吗？
You ready?

1077
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,093
桑的防护罩只剩4%了
GARRETT: Sαn's shields are at four percent.

1078
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,889
现在是2%
Two now.

1079
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,766
他的防护罩失效了
His shields are down.

1080
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,225
可以行动了
Good to go.

1081
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,807
菲利帕！
SAN: Philippa!

1082
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,773
这场较量只有
This contest only ends

1083
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:50,068
一方死去才会结束！
when one of us is dead!

1084
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:59,202
开始引爆程序
GODSEND COMPUTER: Detonation sequence activating.

1085
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,580
你看 我们纳米人不需要联邦
See, the Nanokins, we don't need the Federation.

1086
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:03,915
从来都不需要
We never have.

1087
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,460
在你们这些巨兽发现我们之前 我们就是统治者
We ruled before you behemoths found us,

1088
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,338
等你们消失后 我们还会继续统治
αnd we will rule again after you're gone.

1089
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,473
猜猜谁能在大爆炸中存活？
Guess who survives very Iarge explosions.

1090
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:24,978
非常小的生物
Very small things.

1091
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:28,064
现在失陪了 我要去切断我们的船
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to cut our ship loose.

1092
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,275
抱歉如果你的朋友因此丧命
Sorry if your friends die in the process.

1093
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,110
不 我开玩笑的
No, I'm joking.

1094
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,528
我等不及要杀了他们
I can't wait to kill them.

1095
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:36,406
再见了 你们这些大块头的废物！
So long, you big lumps of shite!

1096
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,215
谁在驾驶那艘船？
Who's flying that?

1097
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:58,053
呃 根据传感器显示 只有一个微小的生命体
Uh, according to the sensors, one tiny life- form on board,

1098
01:15:58,179 --> 01:15:59,888
而且正朝我们飞来
αnd it's heading right for us.

1099
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,476
锁定导弹
Plot missile lock.

1100
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
我们只有垃圾 对 就只有垃圾
We have trash, all right? Just trash.

1101
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:27,874
只剩一个
BOTH: But one.

1102
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,084
桑
YOUNG GEORGIOU: San.

1103
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,928
等待生物特征信号确认
GODSEND COMPUTER: Awaiting biosignature confirmation.

1104
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:42,597
我锁定了法兹的穿梭机
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

1105
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,099
他正返回桑的船上
He's heading back to San's ship.

1106
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,518
-我们勉强跟上了 -别跟丢他
We're barely keeping up. - Stay on him.

1107
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,269
呃 我们没有任何武器
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

1108
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,896
我们有一船舱的垃圾
We have a payload bay full of trash.

1109
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,231
别让那艘穿梭机跑了
Do not lose that shuttle.

1110
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,690
好的
Okay.

1111
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,198
我什么都不是
SAN: I was nothing!

1112
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,034
那个男孩软弱无能
That boy was soft, weak.

1113
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,122
但在你的压迫下 这些年让我成长到今天
But all those years under your heel taught me who I am now.

1114
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,125
帝国军即将通过传送门
The Empire's coming through that portal.

1115
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,292
我的帝国
My Empire!

1116
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,503
我们将以仁慈统治这个宇宙
And we will reign over this universe

1117
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:17,298
不像你那样残暴
with righteous mercy, not like you!

1118
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:22,929
没有仁慈的独裁者 圣
There are no benevolent dictators, San.

1119
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:30,520
这是你教会我的
You taught me that.

1120
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,815
我们还能挽回
We can come back from this.

1121
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,654
重新开始
We can start over.

1122
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,629
我爱混乱
GARRETT: Oh, Ilove chaos.

1123
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,298
混乱才是我的菜
Chaos is my jam.

1124
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,383
我爱混乱 我爱混乱
I love chaos. I love chaos.

1125
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,969
加勒特 你在下面干什么
QUASI: Garrett, what the hell are you doing down there?

1126
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,762
夸西 我可是受过训练的星际舰队军官
Quasi, I am a trained Starfleet officer

1127
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,973
我要活到当上舰长的那天
who fully intends on living long enough to be captain one day.

1128
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,641
你得相信我 好吗
You got to trust me, okay?

1129
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,977
你好啊
ODD VOICE: Hi there.

1130
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,687
真高兴你找到我
I'm so glad you found me.

1131
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,022
你刚说什么
What'd you just say?

1132
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,983
呃...呃…
GARRETT: Uh...uh...

1133
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,276
这是个玩具
lt's αtoy.

1134
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,153
看起来像是来自德罗姆星球的
Looks like it came from a Droom planet.

1135
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,614
我们一起玩点有趣的吧
Shall we do something fun together?

1136
01:18:22,615 --> 01:18:24,699
哇 哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1137
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:26,784
你还好吧 星际舰队
You okay down there, Starfleet?

1138
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,953
哇
: Whoa.

1139
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,749
来吧 来吧 来吧 来吧 好
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yes.

1140
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:35,835
我们不让德罗姆科技进入联邦
Oh, we do not let Droom tech into the Federation

1141
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,588
因为他们用特伦矿作为能源
because they use Terrenium as a power source.

1142
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,798
你是要炸死我们对吧
Oh, you're gonna blow us up, aren't you?

1143
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,051
最好祈祷这艘船的船体
You better hope that this ship's hull

1144
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,053
是用托莫海特加固的
is reinforced with Tomohite.

1145
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:13,248
我是个科学官
I am α science officer.

1146
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,000
科学就是可控的混乱
And science is just controlled chaos.

1147
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,670
混乱 混乱 混乱 混乱 混乱
Whoa, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos!

1148
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,433
啊 快点
Ah, come on.

1149
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,936
起来 你这笨机器人
Get up, you stupid robot.

1150
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,251
不 不
No. No.

1151
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,711
不
No!

1152
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,634
待在费兹的船前面 这样我们就能打开货舱
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship so we can open the payload bay.

1153
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,594
呃 对
Uh, yeah.

1154
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,430
关于这个
About that.

1155
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,057
夸西 马上就要发生巨大爆炸了
Uh, thing is...Quasi, there's about to be α very large explosion.

1156
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,143
这控制台用的是我不认识的语言
This console's in α language I don't know.

1157
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,561
我能破译一些
I can decipher some of it.

1158
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,979
我只需要把它分解成词素
I just have to break it down to morphemes

1159
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,647
然后你知道的…巨大爆炸即将发生
αnd, you know...Large explosion impending.

1160
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,317
这两个按钮任一个都可能打开货舱
Either of these two buttons could open the cargo bay.

1161
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,609
那就两个都按
Okay, so push them both.

1162
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:24,819
这两个按钮任一个也可能
Either of these two buttons could also

1163
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,154
启动自毁程序
initiate a self- destruct protocol.

1164
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,448
反正我们都要爆炸了
- We're gonnα blow up anyway. - Uh- huh.

1165
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,825
夸西 夸西 看着我
- Um, uh. Huh? - Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

1166
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,660
你只需要做个决定
You just need to make o call.

1167
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,120
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

1168
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,747
好吧 好
Okoy. Okay.

1169
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,384
呃
Uh.

1170
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,846
我们可以永远做朋友
We can be friends forever...

1171
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,058
想听个有趣的事吗
Do you want to hear something funny?

1172
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,976
我在自动驾驶
I'm on autopilot.

1173
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,070
见鬼了
What the hell?

1174
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,906
我们都要死了
DROOM DOLL: We're all gonna die.

1175
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,659
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1176
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,080
不
No!

1177
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,917
和你在一起真是太美好了

1178
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,506
好耶

现在就死吧
Die now.

1181
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:43,082
去告诉你的家人你变了多少
Go tell your family how much you've changed.

1182
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,682

Forever.

1204
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:22,473
离子风暴即将汇聚

如果能回到过去
GEORGIOU: If you could go back,

1211
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,276
当你跪在吉里面前时
αnd you were kneeling in front of Giri,

1212
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,111
你会杀了她吗

你愿意终结所有的痛苦和烟雾

1219
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,486

1220
01:25:58,612 --> 01:25:59,862

噢 成熟点
GEORGIOU: Oh. Grow up.

1242
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:23,904
过度兴奋真让人恶心
Perkiness is disgusting.

1243
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,073
是啊
