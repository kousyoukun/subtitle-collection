1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,434
(Man) It's the Ripper! Come on!

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,476
(Angry shouting)

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,835
It's the Ripper! Come on!

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,831
(Shouting)

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,876
(Man) There he goes!

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,838
(Man) He's gone in a house!
(2nd man) Now we've got him!

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,876
(Commotion outside)

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,476
There was another murder.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,869
They're looking for Jack the Ripper.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,995
It's you!

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,117
It's you they're looking for!

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,555
(Screams)

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,796
(Cries)

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,714
Anna... Anna...

15
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,913
It's very cold here, Granny.

16
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,355
It's lonely. Very lonely.

17
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,389
'It's so cold, Granny. So cold.'

18
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,995
Mary, dear,
listen carefully to Granny.

19
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,198
Is there no one with you in the
spirit world to play with, dear?

20
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,639
Is there no one at all?.

21
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,480
(Mary) 'It's very lonely, Granny.'

22
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,279
(Granny) Well, look around you, dear.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,555
Is there no one at all with you?

24
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,949
There must be someone with you.

25
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,038
Oh, I don't think
you're trying, dear.

26
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,076
Look behind you.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,956
(Mary) 'Yes.'

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,795
(Granny) Who is it, dear?
See who it is.

29
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,509
Look hard for Granny, dear, please.

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,558
(Mary) 'I-It's a little girl like me.

31
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,596
'A little girl.'

32
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,955
(Granny) Ask her her name, dear.

33
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,190
Find out her name.

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,271
Not her spirit name, dear.

35
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,831
We wouldn't know her spirit name
down here, would we?

36
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,036
She says her name's Claudia.

37
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,076
(Woman sobs)

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,312
She's very nice but her dress,
it's all wet.

39
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,670
It's Claudia! Claudia, my baby.

40
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,436
(Sobs)

41
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,317
Claudia, can you hear Mama?

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,117
(Mary) 'Claudia,
speak to Mama, please.'

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,232
I hear voices, strange voices,

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,153
but I can't make out
what they're saying.

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,233
What is happening? I don't
understand the foreign language.

46
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,232
Italian? Is it Italian?

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,355
La poverina.

48
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,911
I see a boat. There's been
an accident. Is that what I see?

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,839
I see a boat and I see water.
Lots of water.

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,439
- A lake...
- Claudia, can you hear me?

51
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,114
Speak to me. Please.

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,355
Is Claudia happy, Mary?

53
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,671
Ask the little girl,
is she happy, dear?

54
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,270
It's Granny, dear.

55
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,033
Ask the little girl, is she happy?

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,076
(Woman sobs)

57
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,116
Can you hear me, Mary?

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,959
You must try, dear,
or Granny will get very annoyed.

59
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,069
It's no use. We've lost contact
with the spirit world.

60
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,116
Oh, please try.

61
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,594
If the spirits won't cooperate,

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,910
there's nothing we can do this end.

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,116
(Woman whimpers)

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,156
According to the stars,

65
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,074
the spirits should be
very auspicious next Wednesday,

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,310
if you'd like to try again.

67
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,791
I can spare a little time about 8:30
if you'd like to pass by then.

68
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,348
Mrs Golding,
as a student of the occult

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,399
I've never witnessed such close
contact with the spirit world.

70
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,516
A truly amazing talent, madam.

71
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,558
A very natural talent, Mr Dysart.

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,355
Very natural talent, madam.

73
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,113
- I'll do all I can to help.
- Thank you. We're very grateful.

74
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,112
- Thank you.
- Till Wednesday, then.

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,636
This was your first visit
to a medium, then, Mr Pritchard?

76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,472
Yes, it is.

77
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,915
The young have no interest
in spirits.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,719
There are so few people
they know who are dead.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,791
As one gets older, one finds

80
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,429
that death separates us
more and more from loved ones.

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,114
I wager you find that true,
Dr Pritchard?

82
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,156
Yes, Mrs Golding.

83
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,516
- Ow! Get off!
- My dear young lady!

84
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,433
- What are you doing, girl?.
- Did I hurt you?

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,750
Yes, you did, sir...

86
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,358
I mean, no,
of course you didn't, sir.

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,510
What are you doing down here?

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,195
She loves to listen
to the spirit voices. Run along now.

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,512
I told her, she mustn't loiter
down here when I've got customers...

90
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,512
Guests... She doesn't listen
to a word I say.

91
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,116
Your child, Mrs Golding?

92
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,839
I took her in from an orphanage
some years ago,

93
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,434
out of the goodness of my heart.

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,197
Her mother was done in, I fear.
She's a trifle touched, I'm afraid.

95
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,317
God knows what happened to her father
if she ever had one.

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,516
But one has to do all one can

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,752
for the poor creatures of this world.
Don't you agree, Dr Pritchard?

98
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,796
Yes, Mrs Golding. One must.

99
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,356
Good night, gentlemen. Good night.

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,479
For a music hall turn,
it was entertaining.

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,518
Music hall turn? Criminal deception.

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,875
That poor woman
was driven to hysteria.

103
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,033
Mrs Golding's a bloodsucker making
money out of human grief.

104
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,510
A letter or two in the press
should put her and her like

105
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,670
out of business for good.

106
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,473
Sorry, my boy. I can't expect you
to be interested in my pet causes.

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,393
- Home now, Pleasants, if you please.
- Home?

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,472
- Tonight's my stag party.
- So soon?

109
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,348
Laura arrives tomorrow,
the wedding's only six days away.

110
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,070
- How these things catch up on one.
- I wouldn't phrase it that way.

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,869
We'll talk later. You take
the carriage. I might walk home.

112
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,428
Run along to your club, my boy.

113
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,876
- Good night.
- Have a good time.

114
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,190
(Pleasants) Right, giddy-up now!

115
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,318
Like a cab, sir? I can run down
the Strand and get you one, sir.

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,073
Very well. I'll wait here.

117
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,358
Oh, it's like selling
my own flesh and blood.

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,831
I'll never forgive myself.
The poor little dear is only 17.

119
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,388
Oh, come now. It's bound to happen.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,153
Sooner than later
if I'm any judge of the girl.

121
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,118
You will be kind to her.
She is an innocent girl.

122
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,430
She'd better be at that price.

123
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,956
If I wasn't desperate for money,
I'd never allow this.

124
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,996
Of course not.

125
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,752
(Knock on door)

126
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,030
Hello, my dear.

127
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Don't be frightened, my dear.

128
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,837
Surely your aunt told you I was
going to pay you a visit tonight?

129
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,876
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,040
Shall we close this, my dear?

131
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,393
Makes things more cosy, hmm?

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,230
(Clock chiming and dog barking)

133
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,116
Oh, come on!

134
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,918
I've brought you
a little present, Anna.

135
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,996
Look.

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,959
There, now.
What do you think of that, eh?

137
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,395
I'll wager you've never had anything
as pretty as that before, have you?

138
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,233
It's all precious stones, you know.

139
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,356
How do you like it?

140
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,396
It's all yours, you know.

141
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,471
I say, girl, are you all right?

142
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,915
What's the trouble, eh?

143
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,920
Look, damn it,
what are you playing at?

144
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,116
Is this some sort of trick?

145
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,035
Come on. You're not dealing with some
rustic on his first night in London.

146
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,469
Get up!
Come on, you little bitch! Get up!

147
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,757
- Get up!
- Stop it! Stop it, Mr Dysart.

148
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,195
She's only a poor, innocent girl.

149
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,273
Look, you old bitch, you're
not putting me off with this game.

150
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,669
There, there, Anna. It's all right.

151
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,355
It happens to all of us.
Mr Dysart didn't mean to hurt you.

152
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,433
Oldest trick there is. I expect
you've sold her as a virgin before.

153
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,592
- Never!
- Well, I'll have my way with her

154
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,671
or I'll have my money back...

155
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,638
Stop it! Stop it, Mr Dysart!

156
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,114
All right, then. There's your money.

157
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,952
Good grief, woman!
Have you no sense of values?!

158
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,953
There, there, dear.
It's all right now.

159
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,831
(Ripper's voice) 'Anna...'

160
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,478
Look what you've done...!

161
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,236
(Screaming)

162
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,516
Mrs Golding?

163
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,836
(Groans)

164
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,236
(Children shouting)

165
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,113
Go on! Clear off.
Get off out of it! Buzz off!

166
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,275
Right, now. Come on. Out you come.

167
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,430
(Squabbling)

168
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,759
One fact is abundantly clear,
gentlemen -

169
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,879
whoever impaled that woman
possessed immense strength.

170
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,795
In going through your individual
statements, however,

171
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,110
I've found details that do not...

172
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,760
shall we say,
provide a clear picture.

173
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,152
Inspector, I have a number of
urgent appointments in the Commons.

174
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,518
Mr Dysart, I shall endeavour not
to keep you longer than necessary.

175
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,990
Now, then... Mr and Mrs Wilson.

176
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,799
You were the first
to leave Mrs Golding's house,

177
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,954
once the so-called chat
with the spirit world was concluded.

178
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,192
- That is correct.
- You came out of the house,

179
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,397
got into the carriage
and were driven away.

180
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,155
- Did you see anyone leave after you?
- No, Inspector.

181
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,549
Are you absolutely certain?

182
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,189
My wife was upset. I didn't notice
much beyond that fact.

183
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,078
Then, Dr Pritchard,
you left with your son.

184
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,199
My son took our carriage to his club,
as I told you in my statement.

185
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,953
I sent a boy to the Strand
to fetch me a cab.

186
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,316
When the cab was arriving,
I heard the scream.

187
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,312
And when did you leave the house,
Mr Dysart?

188
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,512
Shortly after the Pritchards.
The door was hardly closed.

189
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,830
- I told you all this.
- Then, Dr Pritchard,

190
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,151
you must have seen
Mr Dysart leave the house.

191
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,109
- No, I did not.
- But you were across the street.

192
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,795
Perhaps, Mr Pritchard,
you noticed Mr Dysart?

193
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,836
I'm afraid not.

194
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,718
I hope you realise
what you're suggesting.

195
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,031
Perhaps you can explain
why you were not seen leaving

196
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,680
by Dr and Mr Pritchard
who were 20 feet away?

197
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,069
I, er...

198
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,116
Inspector, it occurs to me that if
Mr Dysart left two minutes after us,

199
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,395
it's possible we didn't see him

200
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,517
because we were on the far side
of our carriage.

201
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,276
Yes, Dr Pritchard. That is
a possibility that occurred to me.

202
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,272
It is a possible explanation.

203
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,638
Of course. How stupid of me.
I remember the carriage now.

204
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,870
It slipped my mind.

205
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,596
Will you stand up, Mr Dysart?

206
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,912
Dr Pritchard,
you are the only witness I have.

207
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,639
I ask you
to observe Mr Dysart with care.

208
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,109
Could Mr Dysart possibly be the man

209
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,919
you saw leave Mrs Golding
after she screamed?

210
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,993
It was dark. Could you possibly
be mistaken, Doctor?

211
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,353
Think, please, before you answer.

212
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,236
No, I don't think it was Mr Dysart,
Inspector. It was a much larger man.

213
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,475
I'm afraid the villain of this piece
seems to have escaped you, Inspector.

214
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,516
(Train whistle)

215
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,876
(Guard shouting)

216
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,028
She got herself lost, Mr Michael.
I knew it.

217
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,156
Poor, poor girl.

218
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,676
Mrs Bryant, I'd be obliged
if you didn't use that expression.

219
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,036
There's nothing poor about Laura.
There she is!

220
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,838
(Guard) Come on,
ladies and gentlemen!

221
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,234
I'm waiting for my fiancé.
He should be here in a moment.

222
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,713
Laura?

223
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,756
Michael!

224
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,956
Oh, my love, at last!

225
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,989
Oh, it's been a year and four days,
and the four days were the longest.

226
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,356
It'll never happen again,
I promise you.

227
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,557
- Welcome home, Miss Laura.
- Oh, Nanny Bryant.

228
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,359
Now I now I'm really home at last.

229
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,878
My father couldn't make it,
due to "pressure of business".

230
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,349
Your poor father. He works too hard.

231
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,274
Things have changed. He's now
a follower of this man Freud.

232
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,669
He calls himself a psychoanalyst.

233
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,877
Now, now, you two.
You're not married yet.

234
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,953
Mrs Bryant has orders to keep us
in sight until we're married.

235
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,996
I'm to stay at my club.

236
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,319
- The carriage, Miss Laura.
- It's Pleasants!

237
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,039
How nice to hear your voice again.

238
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,989
Drive slowly, so that Michael can
relate to me all that is happening.

239
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,516
(Man coughing)

240
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,396
We questioned her, Doctor,
but she's no memory of the murder.

241
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,436
None at all?.

242
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,556
A complete withdrawal?.

243
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,596
I see.

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,353
Get us out of here! We're starving!

245
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,356
(Women shouting)

246
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,716
We're not certain it wasn't
too much for the girl's mind.

247
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,109
With Ms Golding gone,
who'll look after her?

248
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,397
It'll be the streets for her,
like so many others.

249
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,756
Come in, dearie, why don't you?
Come and see how royalty live.

250
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,796
Only half a crown.

251
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,599
Perhaps as a doctor,
I may be able to help.

252
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,796
She'd be grateful, Doctor.

253
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,156
Want me to put on a show
for the doc, Inspector?

254
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,153
- Come for Little Miss Muffet?
- Come along, you lot.

255
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,196
Move away there.

256
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,159
(Officer) Dirty bitches
have taken her clothes, Inspector.

257
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,196
(Shouting and jeering)

258
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,592
Right. That's enough.
Let the gentleman through. Stop that!

259
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,195
Don't you do that to me.
You'll get your turn. Watch it!

260
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,159
- (Woman) What have I said?
- (Shouting and jeering)

261
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,992
Anna?

262
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,556
Do you remember me, Anna?

263
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,430
Yes, sir. I remember you.

264
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,277
Hey, what about one of us, then, eh?

265
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,033
Belt up, you lot!
Not so much of it, you hear?

266
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,310
Do you know where we're going, Anna?

267
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,356
I don't know, sir.

268
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,034
We're going to my home.

269
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,875
I'm going to look after you
from now on. Would you like that?

270
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,919
No, you'll be quite safe.
There'll be no more seances...

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,036
with you playing the ghost.

272
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,829
No more gentlemen calling on you
in the middle of the night.

273
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,595
- You'll lead a very different life.
- Will I work in the kitchens?

274
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,148
No, Anna. No.

275
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,437
I have a perfectly fine, cook,
housekeeper and a maid.

276
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,548
All you will have to do is to learn
to become one of the family.

277
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,636
- Family, sir?
- Yes.

278
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,632
(Boy) Muffins! Muffins!

279
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,710
(Driver) We're here, sir.

280
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,190
Here we are. We're home.
This is where I live.

281
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,436
(Driver) Thank you, sir.

282
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,796
Do you approve?

283
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,314
Oh, yes, sir! It's beautiful!

284
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,356
Well, let's go in.

285
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,356
This will be your room, Anna.

286
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,875
This used to be my wife's room.

287
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,679
She died a long time ago.

288
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,469
But from now on,
it will known as Anna's room.

289
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,074
Dolly, help Miss Anna
in any way that you can.

290
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,116
(Dolly) Yes, sir.

291
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,591
(Dr Pritchard)
Well, Anna. Are you pleased?

292
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,393
Well, I...see from that that you are.

293
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,673
Dolly, the first thing to do
is get Miss Anna bathed and dressed.

294
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,149
Yes, sir. I'll get the bath ready.

295
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,357
Perhaps you could find something
from my wife's wardrobe

296
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,000
suitable for Miss Anna
to wear for dinner.

297
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,790
Yes, sir. There's the pink dress.
Miss Anna will look lovely in that.

298
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,836
Yes...

299
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,071
Well... Dolly seems to know
where everything is,

300
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,869
so don't hesitate to ask her
for anything that you may want.

301
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,714
Don't you worry, sir.
You'll never recognise her, sir.

302
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,670
Come on, Miss Anna.

303
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,433
(Michael) Pleasants,
bring the luggage.

304
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,795
(Pleasants) Yes, Mr Michael.

305
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,997
(Laura) Oh, Michael,
it's so good to be back.

306
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,756
Three steps down...

307
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,515
Oh, and here's the umbrella stand...

308
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,559
Oh! Here's your knobbly old stick,
do you remember that?

309
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,635
Oh, it's that horrible old clock.
I remember that, too.

310
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,676
We broke it.

311
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,990
And study door...

312
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,036
(Laughs) And the mirror,

313
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,430
which no longer holds any interest
for me at all.

314
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,596
And the table, the chair...

315
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,717
and the Chinese vase...
and now the stairs...

316
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,110
- Laura...
- Oh, Michael, you've moved.

317
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,236
You've got the wrong man, Laura.

318
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,153
Dr Pritchard.
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

319
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,518
How are you, Laura?
I hope you had a pleasant voyage.

320
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,593
- In the guest room, Pleasants.
- Isn't Laura having Mother's room?

321
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,558
I'm afraid not.
We already have a guest.

322
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,111
- May I ask what guest, Father?
- Oh, I can learn a room in minutes.

323
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,317
It's no problem.
I'm only here for a few days.

324
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,470
It's that girl from Mrs Golding's.

325
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,553
They were keeping her in the cells
amongst...very dubious company.

326
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,154
I've said
that she may stay here with us.

327
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,231
You've brought her here?!

328
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,072
Anna?

329
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,271
Anna?

330
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,828
Would you come down a moment,
my dear?

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,833
This is my son Michael.
You remember him?

332
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,559
- How do you do, sir?
- Welcome to our home, Anna.

333
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,317
- Thank you, sir.
- This is my fiancée Laura.

334
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,955
- Hello, Anna.
- Laura is blind, my dear.

335
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,474
- Miss Laura...
- Oh, don't be worried.

336
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,155
It's just a nuisance.
I see with my hands.

337
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,599
Dolly, take Miss Anna
to have her bath.

338
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,514
Come along, Miss Anna.
I've got the water ready.

339
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,752
And I must get back to work.
See you at dinner later, Laura.

340
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,316
Call Mrs Bryant and get her
to show Laura to her room.

341
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,230
What a kind man he is.

342
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,313
I've been expecting you.

343
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,076
Doctor, I've no idea why you saw fit
to save me from great embarrassment

344
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,390
but I'm much obliged to you, sir.

345
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,436
It was a misunderstanding -

346
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,910
one which could have ruined
my parliamentary career.

347
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,516
Yes, Mr Dysart. Being hanged could
have ruined your neck, as well.

348
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,353
I don't wish to slight
your contribution

349
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,908
but it wouldn't have gone that far.

350
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,754
Really? Mr Dysart, either you
or Anna killed Mrs Golding.

351
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,990
Oh, come now!

352
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,596
Surely you don't think
a respectable Member of Parliament

353
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,875
goes about murdering people.

354
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,350
If you even suspected I was guilty,
why did you lie to save me?

355
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,635
Because it suited my purpose.

356
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,234
My knowledge
of certain mental diseases

357
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,311
leads me to suspect one of you.

358
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,718
- I could be wrong.
- I saw it. She was possessed.

359
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,998
Her whole body was contorted.
Her hands...

360
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,072
- They weren't her hands.
- Really? Whose were they?

361
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,913
How should I know? She was possessed.

362
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,029
If she wasn't,
how could she manage, a frail girl,

363
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,475
to drive the poker through
flesh and bone

364
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,552
plus an inch and a half oak door?

365
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,029
The hysteria accompanying certain
disorders

366
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,076
can produce extraordinary strength.

367
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,550
- That's one explanation.
- The other being that I did it?

368
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,790
A possibility.

369
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,556
I don't understand. If you thought
I committed a crime that brutal,

370
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,438
we'd hardly be discussing it
about your home.

371
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,478
- Anna is upstairs at this moment.
- She's what?!

372
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,350
I intend to study her. To do that,
she must remain in my care.

373
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,672
Damn it, she's a possessed being,
as savage as any beast.

374
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,869
Listen to me. Since time began,
men have been murdering one another.

375
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,793
When it happens,
we hunt the murderer down

376
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,270
and use the law
to murder him in return.

377
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,478
We've tortured him,
burned him alive, disembowelled him,

378
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,996
though nowadays we're more humane -
we simply hang him.

379
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,517
And all this time, we have never
once tried to understand him,

380
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,556
to find out why.

381
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,189
Why one human being
murders another human being.

382
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,239
So we go on having murders
and murdering in revenge.

383
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,595
Only the graveyard worms are richer.

384
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,274
- But she was possessed...
- Nonsense!

385
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,069
I believe the girl is suffering
from a disorder of the mind,

386
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,789
possibly brought on by some
terrifying experience in childhood.

387
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,555
Maybe it was congenital,
but it has divided her mind.

388
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,394
There's an Austrian doctor
called Freud who studied this.

389
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,436
It's called schizophrenia.

390
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,910
He also used a new science
called psychoanalysis

391
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,312
to explore the mind
and its disorders, to find out why.

392
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,153
This is the technique
I would like to use with Anna

393
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,992
but I need your help.

394
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,158
Now perhaps you can understand
my behaviour at the police station.

395
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,994
I want you to use your position
to find out about her past -

396
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,435
her family,
where she lived, everything.

397
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,389
The slightest detail could be vital
to understanding her condition.

398
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,836
- What if she murders somebody else?
- She won't.

399
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,071
Even if she did, to understand
the psychology of murder

400
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,515
would be worth the risk.

401
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,315
And if I refuse?

402
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,675
I might just remember
who it was I saw

403
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,069
leaving the house after the murder.

404
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,953
With greater accuracy this time.

405
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,635
You'd better go the way you came.

406
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,118
(Giggling)

407
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,839
One thing you've got to learn
around here

408
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,152
is to affect what Dr Pritchard
calls a happy countenance,

409
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,950
which means he likes to see people
with smiles on their faces, he does.

410
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,591
Not that he's one for smiles and
giggles himself, know what I mean?

411
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,638
- Not like us.
- I wasn't crying because I was sad,

412
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,711
I was crying because I was happy.

413
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,237
- It's such a beautiful room.
- I know you were, Miss Anna. Oh!

414
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,836
Oh, it's all right.
It's only Dr Pritchard.

415
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:31,550
Anna, at my age, one treats modesty
as an affectation of the ugly.

416
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,756
It'll fit Miss Anna a treat, sir.

417
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,434
See how this goes with the dress.

418
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,795
Oh, sir. It's lovely!

419
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,919
We'll be at the restaurant
within the hour,

420
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,673
as soon as I can leave the embassy.

421
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,719
I've left you the carriage.
Pleasants will see you to the door.

422
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,552
Dolly.

423
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,759
Don't let her out of your sight
until she's in the carriage.

424
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,832
She's had a disturbing day.
She needs company.

425
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,071
All right, sir. Oh, Miss Anna.

426
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,596
You're going to look
like a proper princess tonight.

427
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,910
You just wait and see.

428
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,956
( # Waltz)

429
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,550
- Here.
- Ooh!

430
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,758
Ooh, it's a tight fit.
Goodness, look at the time.

431
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,830
(Music ends, applause)

432
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,879
Oh, darling, your holding me like
this is ruining our reputations,

433
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,916
but I could do it all night.

434
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,436
- Then we shall.
- When we're married, please.

435
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,354
But now there's no more music,
and your father's waiting.

436
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,590
Oh, Father...

437
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,876
(Music resumes)

438
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,476
Oh, it's so hot.

439
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,673
- Let's go back and dance.
- No. My feet hurt. I'm sitting down.

440
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,751
- I'm so hot.
- To your right.

441
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,670
Ah! That's better.

442
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,159
The dancing's made me thirsty. Oh!

443
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,992
Oh, my goodness.

444
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,911
It's all right.

445
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,995
I must leave. I'm worried about Anna.
She should have arrived by now.

446
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,789
- We shan't be late.
- Mrs Bryant will look after you.

447
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,348
Thank you, Dr Pritchard.

448
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,637
I'm sorry. Something seems to have
spoilt the evening for your father.

449
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,676
But not for me.

450
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,829
Oh, Dolly. It's so beautiful.

451
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,798
I'm afraid to move
for fear I'll wake up.

452
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,189
You're not asleep, Miss Anna.

453
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,475
Here. Take a look at the back.

454
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,075
Do you have to all me "Miss"?
I'd much prefer us to be friends.

455
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,516
No, that would never do.
You can't have the likes of me

456
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,194
talking to a lady
on such familiar terms.

457
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,035
- But I'm not a real lady yet.
- Wait till you see yourself in this.

458
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,317
Oh, Miss Anna,
you're going to look lovely tonight.

459
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,960
Everybody's
going to be looking at you.

460
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,999
You're going to be the belle
of the ball, you just wait and see.

461
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,030
There. It'll look lovely
on that dress.

462
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,196
There now.

463
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,636
Oh, Miss Anna, do you like it?

464
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,188
Oh, you do like it. I knew you would.

465
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,437
Miss Anna, you look just like
a little doll,

466
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,080
all done up to meet the queen.

467
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,357
I'll kiss you now, then,
before you become a lady.

468
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,355
(Ripper's voice) 'Anna...'

469
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,670
(Blood-curdling scream)

470
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,431
Pleasants, go to the restaurant and
tell Mr Michael that you're waiting.

471
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,432
- I'll take a cab if I need one.
- Very good, sir.

472
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,032
Anna...

473
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,071
Anna?

474
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,956
Give it to me, Anna.

475
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,996
Give it to me.

476
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,470
I will keep it for you.

477
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,916
Stay here.

478
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,670
Stay here.

479
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,152
Dolly?

480
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,233
Anna...

481
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,276
Come with me.

482
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,035
(Animals squeaking)

483
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,396
What am I doing here?

484
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,076
- We should be at the restaurant.
- It's all right.

485
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,277
It's very late. You've had long day.

486
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,435
You're becoming very sleepy.

487
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,954
Yes, I am. Very sleepy.

488
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,757
- Has anything happened?
- Nothing, my dear.

489
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,308
You dozed off and had a bad dream.

490
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,830
(Nanny) Oh, Dr Pritchard...

491
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,038
You came back and found me asleep.

492
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,759
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

493
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,310
- Ah, this is what I was looking for.
- Dr Pritchard.

494
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,155
It's all right, Mrs Bryant. Laura's
capable of putting herself to bed.

495
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,233
You must get your sleep, considering
the heavy time ahead of us.

496
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,834
Oh, yes. The wedding arrangements.

497
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,390
That Dolly promised to wake me up
when you came in, sir.

498
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,630
Where has the girl gone?

499
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,952
I'm afraid we've lost our Dolly,
Mrs Bryant.

500
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,996
As Anna and I were leaving,

501
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,753
a man brought a message
from Dolly's mother.

502
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:31,675
I never knew she had one. I'd never
heard her speak of her mother.

503
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,354
Apparently, her mother's gravely ill.

504
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,718
There was nothing I could do but send
her off to give what help she could.

505
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,839
- She was terribly upset.
- That kind of girl does come and go.

506
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,673
All young girls today lack character.

507
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,435
(Tuts) It's a fact.
Can I get you anything, Doctor?

508
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,080
No, thank you.
I just came back for this.

509
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,312
I shall be here when Laura returns,
so there's no need to stay up.

510
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,119
If you're certain
that I won't be needed,

511
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,192
I think I will take a little rest.

512
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,352
- I'll call if I need you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

513
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,908
It's time you were up, Miss Anna.

514
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,631
Come, now, Miss Anna,
it's way past noon.

515
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,077
If you don't get up, it'll be too
late to bother getting up at all.

516
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,549
- Oh, this is disgraceful.
- Mrs Bryant.

517
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,470
Let her sleep.
I gave her a sedative last night.

518
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,475
I want you to keep an eye on her.
I don't want her to leave the house.

519
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,516
Is she not well, Doctor?

520
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,150
- It isn't contagious, is it?
- No, Mrs Bryant.

521
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,518
It's just that she needs rest
and care, that's all.

522
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,990
Whatever you say, Doctor.

523
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,792
(Chimes)

524
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,956
There you are, Pritchard.

525
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,830
Your message suggested, as well
as hysteria, that you've had success.

526
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,876
Doctor, being a scientist,

527
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,714
you'll find nothing I say
about possession believable.

528
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,270
So you've found someone
to say it for you?

529
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,432
As you know,
our dear Queen Victoria herself...

530
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,911
Really, Dysart, the beliefs of that
dear lady have no interest for me.

531
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,709
- What have you found out about Anna?
- Nothing whatsoever.

532
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,918
I've checked newspapers,
police files, all without success.

533
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,879
However, I have contacted
a certain personage.

534
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,315
The Royal Medium, Madame Bullard.

535
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,119
Please, Dysart, not a seance.

536
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,557
Madame Bullard has kindly consented
to give you an interview tomorrow.

537
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,155
I advise you to go. You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

538
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,073
I know very well
what I'm dealing with.

539
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,109
Unless you keep that appointment
tomorrow, I'm going to the police.

540
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,192
Now, Anna,
we're going on a voyage, you and I,

541
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,716
back in time
to when you were a very little girl.

542
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,236
I want you to try and remember
as far back as you can. Back in time.

543
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,275
Try and search in your mind for that
time when you were very, very small.

544
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,274
Do you remember you mother, Anna?
What was she like?

545
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,869
She wore a silk dress...
with a frill around the bottom.

546
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,916
Mm-hm...

547
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,037
There was a fire in the grate,
and it was warm.

548
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,396
'Sometimes...'

549
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,436
(Pritchard) 'Sometimes?'

550
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,873
(Tinkling)

551
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,916
(Pritchard) 'Sometimes?'

552
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,028
(Anna) 'Sometimes I'd sit on her lap
by the fire. Sometimes on the rug.'

553
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,395
- There were bars.
- Where?

554
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,553
Around my bed.
There were bars around my bed.

555
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,394
There were bars around my bed.

556
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,956
And it got very cold.
The fire died away very slowly.

557
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,228
It got very, very cold.

558
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,716
My mother kept...

559
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,155
kept lying there so still...

560
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,316
for a long time...

561
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,316
staring at me.

562
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,157
- Yes, Anna. Go on.
- (Laughter and voices)

563
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,676
Rest, Anna.

564
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,910
Rest a moment.

565
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,148
- I can't let you go.
- We'll be all right.

566
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,038
Oh, Doctor.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you,

567
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,999
but Mr Michael and Miss Laura,
they're being very rebellious.

568
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,116
We're only going out to dinner.

569
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,115
I can hardly chaperone them and look
after Miss Anna and yourself as well.

570
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,670
I'm only a singular person.

571
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,752
Yes, you're quite right.
Go with them to dinner.

572
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,037
Anna and I can manage.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

573
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,270
(Laura) Hurry up, Nanny.

574
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,431
Anna?

575
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,116
Anna!

576
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,193
(Chattering and shouting)

577
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,670
- What are you doing?
- Get out of here!

578
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,309
You're a bit young for this game.
Get off home!

579
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,790
'Ere you. What are you doin'? Go on!

580
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,835
Hello, there. You lost yourself,
have you, my dear?

581
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,434
You're a bit young
for this game, aren't you?

582
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,557
Them old bags
up there'll have your hair off

583
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,596
if they catch you on their beat.

584
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,274
Let's look at you. Nice little thing.

585
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,512
Anna?

586
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,352
Anna?

587
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,236
(Men arguing)

588
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,753
Anna?

589
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,957
When I started,
it was a different kettle of fish.

590
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,636
Every girl for herself. None of this
business of having your territory.

591
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,999
Ooh, there was lovely houses in them
days, all crystal and silk hangings,

592
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,198
and lovely gentlemen to tip you
a guinea just for luck.

593
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,236
Beautiful, it was.

594
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,153
Anna?

595
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,320
Come on, dearie. Come on!

596
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,994
- (Dog barking)
- Anna.

597
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,709
(Laughs) No,
it's all too regulated now, dear,

598
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,759
what with the police on you
and the price of gin what it is,

599
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,354
and how even so-called
nice ladies act!

600
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,389
You can't tell the professionals
from the amateurs! Just a minute.

601
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,235
Oh, now... Bloody key.
Oh, there we are.

602
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,709
Now, watch your step, dear.

603
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,552
(Laughs)

604
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,479
Now. There. That's it.

605
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,755
There you are. Wait there, dear.

606
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,711
Nice little thing, she is.

607
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,792
There. That's put some light
on the subject.

608
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,156
Now, a pretty young girl
like yourself,

609
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,310
you've got to start out right.

610
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,712
And the right way isn't by tramping
up and down on some street

611
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,951
what's already being solicited on.

612
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,835
Now, I'll just take a little drop
of this, dear...for my throat.

613
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,232
(Burps)

614
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,314
No, you see, that's what could have
put all those girls in such a temper.

615
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,997
But don't you worry, dear.
Long Liz is gonna look after you.

616
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,073
Anna?

617
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,356
(Pritchard) Anna?

618
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,079
I'm looking for a girl, this tall,
in a cloak. Have you seen her?

619
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,709
- I've seen many girls pass.
- Have you seen this one?

620
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,873
- Round by the Crown and Trumpet.
- Crown and Trumpet?

621
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,474
- Anna!
- If it's a real woman you want...

622
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,317
No, even though the good days
is gone for all of us,

623
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,914
there's still good pickings
to be made.

624
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,312
Especially for the likes of you...
at your age.

625
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,755
You're quite a pretty little thing.

626
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,195
'Ere. Stand up, m'dear.

627
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,714
Let's have a little look
at you, then.

628
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,756
Come on, then.

629
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,674
Oh, you're a bit modest there
for most gentlemen's taste,

630
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,718
but not to worry,
they'll get plumper in time,

631
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,234
and a few little tricks I know.

632
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,517
Oh, poor little thing,
shivering with the cold?

633
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,591
It's a wonder you didn't freeze.

634
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,910
(Ripper's voice) 'Anna...'

635
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,831
(Blood-curdling scream)

636
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,790
Time you and I...

637
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,873
Oh, my God! (Screams)

638
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,510
I'm looking for a girl
wearing a cloak. Have you seen her?

639
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,637
- I'll pay you well.
- That must be the new one.

640
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,156
Yeah, we saw her. She'll remember us
us, too. Right little grabber.

641
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,232
I shouldn't have thought
she was enough woman for you.

642
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,357
- Where is she?
- Where's that money?

643
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,238
- Liz took her back to her place.
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,233
- Who's Liz? Where does she live?
- Liz likes the little girls.

645
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,788
- Where does she live?
- Not so bloody hard!

646
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,634
Hands off me! Don't squeeze the fruit
unless you're buying it.

647
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,316
- Tell me where to find this Liz!
- Blimey! There she is now!

648
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,356
(Screaming)

649
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,033
(Man) Who the bloody hell done this?

650
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,714
(2nd man) Somebody get the police!

651
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,476
Anna?

652
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,716
(Hoof beats)

653
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,392
(Driver) Cab?

654
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,436
(Whistle blows in distance)

655
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,476
(Crowd shouting)

656
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,393
(Man) You bastard! We'll have you!
Over this way.

657
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,596
(2nd man) Hey, you! Stop!

658
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,798
That bloke's all right. He was
with us when we found Long Liz.

659
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,390
(Vicar) 'In sickness
and in health...'

660
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,630
(Laura) In sickness and in health...

661
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,156
- For better and for worse...
- For better and for worse...

662
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,109
- Till death us do part...
- Till death us do part...

663
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,555
And even then,
I plight thee my troth.

664
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,349
And even then,
I plight thee my troth.

665
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,671
If anyone here assembled
knows just cause

666
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,479
why this couple should not be
joined in holy wedlock,

667
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,519
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

668
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,954
- I know of one very just cause, sir.
- What?

669
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,319
If you go any further, they'll be
properly married at their rehearsal.

670
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,551
Quite right, Doctor.
It's true, you know.

671
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,633
Once when I was a very young curate,
I got so carried away

672
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,075
that I prematurely
spliced the couple

673
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,355
right on the spot.

674
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,353
- When do we rehearse the kissing?
- I was wondering the same thing.

675
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,798
Laura, I believe you'd like a
little practice finding the register?

676
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,351
- Yes, please.
- The rest of you may stand easy

677
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,034
while we sort out
the stroll to the vestry.

678
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:32,316
Step up now.
That's it... That's good.

679
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,393
Why are you crying, Anna?

680
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,994
Because it's all so beautiful.

681
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,071
They look so lovely and happy.

682
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,720
I don't know what I'll do
at the real wedding.

683
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,356
Come, Anna.

684
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,991
- Dr Pritchard, do you think...?
- Anna...

685
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,152
I want you to think of me
as a friend, to trust me.

686
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,356
Would it help if you called me John?

687
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,069
- Oh, no, sir. I couldn't.
- Well, I won't have "sir",

688
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,232
and Dr Pritchard
sounds much too formal.

689
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,790
- Dr John.
- Hmm. All right.

690
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,190
- You were going to ask something?
- Yes, I was wondering...

691
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,033
"Even then, I plight thee my troth."

692
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,079
Do you think we know each other
in that other world, Dr John?

693
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,948
- What do you mean?
- Well, at Mrs Golding's sometimes,

694
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,600
I know I was only pretending...

695
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,353
but sometimes I got into their world.

696
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,350
They were so mad, so full of hate...

697
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,311
unhappy.

698
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,473
- Last night...
- That was just a bad dream, Anna.

699
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,189
- I told you, a bad dream.
- No.

700
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,953
No, I felt them
coming to me so clearly.

701
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,716
Anna, there are no such things
as spirits. This is nonsense.

702
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,759
- I want you to meet a certain lady.
- Is she a doctor, too?

703
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,832
No, she's not a doctor. Trust me.

704
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,234
Anna...

705
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,154
Anna... Trust me.

706
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,196
(Knock at door)

707
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,236
(Door opens)

708
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,912
A gentleman and young lady
to see you, madame.

709
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,912
- They gave no name.
- Ask them to come in, Maude.

710
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,956
They are expected.

711
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,996
(Clock chimes)

712
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,196
Do come in.

713
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,436
And be seated.

714
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,555
This is Miss Anna.

715
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,598
Hello, my dear. Sit here, won't you?

716
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,912
- What a pretty dress you have on.
- Thank you, madame.

717
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,915
- I hear you have lost your past.
- It's facts I need, madame.

718
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,232
- I can only tell you what I see.
- What the crystal ball reveals?

719
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,477
Sir, I do not really understand
the process myself,

720
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,394
but I use no apparatus,
unless I can call myself apparatus.

721
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,632
No crystal ball, not even tea leaves.

722
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,030
Sorry if I disappoint you.
Shall I proceed?

723
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,756
Oh, what a very pretty little face
you have, my dear.

724
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,798
Don't be alarmed.
Nothing I do will harm you.

725
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,440
I've often helped people
to find their past,

726
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,308
an sometimes it can be
such a very pleasant exper...

727
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,234
There is a violence in this girl.
I felt it. Quite sudden.

728
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:23,438
It's still there now.
Something horribly violent.

729
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,159
Something to do
with someone close to her.

730
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,508
I see a room, firelight,

731
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,830
a red carpet...

732
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,559
a bed and a child.

733
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,154
A little girl is in the bed.

734
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:46,633
There is a woman, her mother,
and a man, her fa...

735
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,029
Yes. Her father.

736
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,078
He's well-dressed, well-spoken.

737
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,116
A nobleman.

738
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,158
His clothes are years ago.

739
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,957
There's blood on his clothes.
He is a man who murders.

740
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,316
The little girl...it is Anna.

741
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,997
She's alone. There is a woman
on the floor, lying there, still.

742
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,076
Blood.

743
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,679
The man has murdered
the mother of his child.

744
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,228
And that child...

745
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,278
That child is Anna.

746
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,158
Who is this man?

747
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,789
Berner Street... Berner Street.

748
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,075
Why, it's...

749
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,630
Oh, my God!

750
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,676
He's the Ripper!

751
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,190
Who was it?

752
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,749
Who was this man? I must know!

753
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,156
I can't tell you.

754
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,950
But I warn you, the violence
of that man is still in this girl.

755
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,033
She is what I would call possessed.

756
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,156
Poor child!

757
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,155
There, there. It's all right.
Don't be frightened.

758
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,435
You're all right now.

759
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,750
Poor child.

760
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,396
(Ripper's voice) 'Anna...'

761
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,393
Come along, Anna.
It's time for us to go.

762
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,759
Madam...

763
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,473
Anna!

764
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,112
Anna!

765
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,316
Why?

766
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,356
Why?!

767
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,792
(Driver) Giddy-up.

768
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,836
Come in.

769
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,359
- What the devil do you want?
- What did Madame Bullard say?

770
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,998
Nothing.

771
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,675
A lot of mumbo jumbo about
Jack the Ripper being her father.

772
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,716
- I knew it!
- He's been dead years.

773
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,679
- That explains it.
- Rubbish. It's not a fact.

774
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,069
- If Madame Bullard...
- She's a fake!

775
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,913
Dysart, I'm beginning
to make progress.

776
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,072
I'm discovering the causes
of her actions. I will cure her.

777
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,390
You can't cure Jack the Ripper!

778
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,790
- That's who she is!
- Listen to me, Dysart!

779
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,871
Listen to me.

780
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,633
Let me show you
what I've discovered.

781
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,511
Come, Anna.

782
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,476
Now, lie down, Anna.

783
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,359
Now you're feeling very tired, Anna.

784
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,396
Sleep.

785
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,556
Sleep.

786
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,190
Sleep.

787
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,031
Her condition is induced by nothing
more than a flickering light.

788
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,395
Do you remember where this began?

789
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,517
She used to hide behind a grille
at Mrs Golding's.

790
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,309
The firelight flickering through
the grille set up a conditioning,

791
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,598
which she associated
with this spirit world nonsense.

792
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,071
She's an emotional, sensitive girl.
In reaction against the terrors

793
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,709
of the world she grew up in,
her mind went into revolt.

794
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,349
It sought every opportunity
available to forget,

795
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,639
to escape into a safer world,
where no one could intrude...

796
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,075
or inflict pain...

797
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,035
or lust.

798
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:07,557
While the light flickered,
Anna felt safe.

799
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,791
She felt needed and useful.
So, in moments of stress,

800
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,997
her mind seized on any similar
pattern to escape.

801
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,399
You may be right, but she's
a murderer, a murderer's daughter.

802
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,436
You can't escape that.

803
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,672
- Murder must be punished.
- Please, let me prove my theory.

804
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,993
Anna?

805
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,232
Anna?

806
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,077
Anna, I want you to open your eyes
and look at something.

807
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,550
Can you see it, Anna?

808
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,312
Yes.

809
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,356
I remember.

810
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,674
I thought it was lost.

811
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,878
Now, look at it again, Anna.

812
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,675
Thank you, Anna.

813
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,070
Now I want you to close your eyes
and sleep again.

814
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,316
Rest, Anna... Rest...

815
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,392
You're very tired.

816
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,630
- She's perfectly safe in that state.
- How can a murderer be safe?!

817
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,029
What sets her off?
Why does she kill?.

818
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,159
I haven't discovered what triggers
her violence but when I do...

819
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,993
Don't you see? I'm near a discovery

820
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,755
that could change conceptions
of crime - and punishment.

821
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,877
Yes, all very interesting, I'm sure.

822
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,669
But it doesn't solve the problem,
which is still one of morality.

823
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,675
The girl brutally murdered a woman,
possibly more, and she is unpunished.

824
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,673
Is that all you can think of? I'm
about to find out why she has to kill

825
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,672
and all you can think of is revenge.
I can cure her.

826
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,069
The only cure for her trouble

827
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,072
is a length of good,
stout rope about her neck.

828
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,392
It was always the answer. I must
have been mad to listen to you.

829
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,948
Fear has made me neglect my duty.

830
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,636
And I think, Pritchard,
any revised testimony you give

831
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,076
about seeing me that night
will be a waste of your breath,

832
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,311
once it's out you're harbouring
a murderer.

833
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,272
As a public servant,
I intend to expose this menace.

834
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,555
Good day to you, sir.

835
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,756
Anna, my dear...

836
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,630
I failed.

837
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,950
I failed you and I failed myself.

838
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,716
Forgive me, Anna.

839
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,594
(Ripper's voice) 'Anna...

840
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,318
'Anna...'

841
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,356
(Blood-curdling scream)

842
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,872
No! Anna!

843
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,916
(Squelch)

844
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,356
(Groans)

845
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,916
Anna!

846
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,991
The alterations
to the dress will take hours.

847
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:24,390
- I can't possibly go with you.
- We'll go alone.

848
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,916
Go alone?!
You can't be seen out together,

849
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,072
two days before your wedding,
unchaperoned.

850
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,116
Ah, there's your solution.

851
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,431
- Where are you off to?
- Anna, you're just in time

852
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,274
to save not only our reputation
in society but honour, as well.

853
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,238
Don't get too tired, Miss Laura.

854
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,279
- See she doesn't, Mr Michael.
- (Michael) She'll be all right.

855
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,918
Goodbye.

856
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,556
(Groans)

857
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,352
(Wails)

858
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,636
(Sword clattering)

859
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,913
Dr Pritchard, is that you?

860
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,668
Yes, Mrs Bryant. Is Michael with you?

861
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:22,673
He and Miss Laura have gone
to his office in the city, Doctor,

862
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,716
but it's all right, sir.

863
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,998
Anna's with them as chaperone.
I wouldn't let them go alone.

864
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,356
I'll just go off
and get your tea ready, Doctor.

865
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:26,395
Take the stairs on the left
for the Whispering Gallery, madam.

866
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,471
Thank you.

867
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,829
Do you know
there are 258 steps up here?

868
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,878
My father used to bring me
when I was a little girl.

869
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,030
I used to so look forward to it.

870
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,475
He'd sit on one side, 100 feet away,

871
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,630
and I'd sit on the other side.

872
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:47,555
He'd whisper a line of poetry, and
I'd whisper the next if I knew it.

873
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,555
That way, I learnt to speak poetry
before I could even read.

874
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,074
(Gasps for breath)

875
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,515
Anna, give me your hand.

876
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,788
I'm longing for you to see this.

877
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,030
It's really beautiful.

878
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,954
We shall be just under the dome
when we reach the top.

879
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,994
(Driver) Whoa, there.
We're here, sir.

880
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,397
- You all right, sir?
- Get Mr Michael, quickly.

881
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,436
Right away, sir.

882
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,353
(Vendor) Paper! Paper!
Read all about it!

883
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,228
Latest edition! Paper! Paper!

884
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,476
- Anna, Laura, where are they?
- St Paul's.

885
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,677
- Get in. We must get there quickly.
- What's the matter?

886
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,116
- St Paul's, quickly.
- (Driver) Giddap!

887
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,832
Ah.

888
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,751
(Exhales)

889
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,276
Oh, I'm exhausted
after all those stairs.

890
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,672
Anna, why don't you go over
to the rail?. Look down.

891
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,194
I knew you'd like it.
Now, go over to the other side,

892
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:12,068
and sit down and listen
to what I'm going to whisper to you.

893
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,116
Go on, Anna.

894
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,157
Are you there yet, Anna? Anna?

895
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:52,989
(Whispered echo)
Are you there yet, Anna? Anna?

896
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,036
Are you there yet?

897
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,236
- Anna?
- (Echo) Anna?

898
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,276
(Whispers) Dr John, help me.

899
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,440
In her trance...

900
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,069
any kiss would bring back
the horror...

901
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,831
of the last image...of her father.

902
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,590
Then...he would possess her.

903
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,829
He would make her kill.

904
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,270
I was wrong.

905
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,476
I made a terrible mistake.

906
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,120
We must get to Laura
before anything happens.

907
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,668
Anna, what are you saying?
I can't hear you.

908
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,434
(Echo) Anna, what are you saying?
I can't hear you.

909
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,069
(Ripper's voice)
'We finished him off, my dear.'

910
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,515
Dr John?

911
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,670
'He's dead and gone,

912
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:51,320
'along with all the others.'

913
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,355
Anna, is there someone with you?

914
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,954
(Echo) Anna,
is there someone with you?

915
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,076
Help me!

916
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,833
(Ripper) 'The dead can't help, Anna.

917
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,070
'Neither can the living.'

918
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,873
Help me!

919
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,597
Anna, what's the matter? (Echoes)

920
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,433
(Ripper) 'The dead can't help, Anna.'

921
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,994
It's perfectly safe.
You can't fall. You stay there.

922
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,833
I'm coming round to you.

923
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,876
Don't be frightened.

924
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,790
Have two young ladies just gone up?

925
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,836
A little while back, yes, sir.

926
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,390
- Go ahead. I can't make it.
- We're about to close.

927
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,392
I'm coming, Anna. Anna?

928
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,710
(Ripper) 'Anna...'

929
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,237
Anna? Anna, where are you?

930
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,031
Anna?

931
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,910
They were not all dreams.

932
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,874
Not all dreams.

933
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,238
(Ripper) 'What are dreams,
and what's real, Anna?

934
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,470
'I've never known.

935
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,711
- 'What does it matter?'
- They were not all dreams!

936
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,116
Dr John!

937
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,556
Dr John!

938
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,915
Oh, Dr John, help me!

939
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,759
(Shouts) Anna!

940
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,989
Laura!

941
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,034
Anna, dear, whatever is the matter?
You're trembling like a leaf.

942
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,079
Don't be frightened.
Just don't look down.

943
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,311
Hold on to me,
and I'll lead you back.

944
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,836
Laura!

945
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,513
Anna?

946
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,878
(Ripper) 'Whose darkness
do we meet in, Laura?

947
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,670
'Your darkness or mine? (Laughs)'

948
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:40,556
(Pritchard) Anna, come to me!

949
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,593
Anna, come to me!

950
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,278
Anna...come to me.

951
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,434
Come to me!

952
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,353
Laura.

953
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,954
It's all right.
It's all right, darling.

954
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,838
Come to me!

955
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,112
Dr John!

956
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,516
(Whispers) Anna...
