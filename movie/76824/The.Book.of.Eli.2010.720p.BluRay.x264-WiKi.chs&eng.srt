00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,322
不错，不错
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,004
你饿吗？
You hungry?

4
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,174
你得过来才能吃到 别装着不感兴趣
You know, you gotta come get it. Don't play hard to get.

5
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,802
你会喜欢的
You'll like it.

6
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,175
是猫肉
It's cat.

7
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,975
给你
There you go.

8
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,975
我不知道...
I don't know what...

9
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,143
留点给早饭
Leave room for breakfast.

10
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,840
电量不足

11
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,158
喂，你好？
Hello?

12
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,538
你好

13
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,807
求你了，别伤害我
Please. Don't hurt me.

14
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,475
想要什么都可以拿走
Here, take anything you want.

15
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,229
你想要吃的吗？拿着
You want some food? Take it.

16
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,318
- 我不会伤害你 - 是吗？
- I'm not gonna hurt you. - Yeah?

17
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,521
上次那个人也这么说的
That's what the last guy said.

18
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,701
你能帮我码？ 轮子掉下来了
Could... Could you help me? The wheel came off.

19
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,241
我修不好了
I can't fix it.

20
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,038
也许我行，但我不行
Maybe if I... If I could, but I can't.

21
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,081
没有肥皂的唯一好处
You know, the only good thing about no soap

22
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,793
是你可以从很远就能闻到强盗的味道
is that you can smell hijackers a mile off.

23
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,338
你不得了阿！
I am impressed!

24
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:33,806
这个人10米以外就闻到了我们！
This man smelled us from 30 feet away!

25
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,971
操！
Damn!

26
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,103
说的是我们很臭吗？
What's that say about our hygiene?

27
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,232
你背包里面是什么？
What you got there in that pack?

28
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,736
什么包？
What pack?

29
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,231
他有枪
He got a gun.

30
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,867
妈的，没装子弹
Shit, it ain't loaded.

31
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,700
他们这些人都不装子弹
They never are.

32
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,328
没错吧，老头
Ain't that right, old man?

33
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,961
打开包，把东西都倒出来 好好地，慢慢地
Open the pack and tip it out on the road, nice and slow.

34
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,256
没办法这么做
Can't do that.

35
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,764
把他妈的包放下 放在地上
Take off the fucking pack and put it on the ground.

36
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,137
不然要你的命！
Or die!

37
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,184
你在听我说吗？
Are you listening to me?

38
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,982
我现在在听
I am now.

39
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,859
- 好 - 你在听我说吗？
- Good. - You listening to me?

40
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,032
- 是的 - 很好
- Yeah. - Good.

41
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,656
你手再碰我 就别想再拿回去了
Put that hand on me again, you won't get it back.

42
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,287
你们相信这个该死的家伙吗？
Do you believe this fucking guy?

43
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,085
好吧，你想来硬的
All right, you wanna do it the hard way.

44
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,595
你怎么做到的？
How'd you do that?

45
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,056
他把我的手砍掉了！
He just cut my hand off!

46
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,940
你们都站在那儿干什么？ 吻他！
What are you standing around for? Kiss him!

47
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,851
他说什么？
What did he say?

48
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,483
他吓坏了
He's in shock.

49
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,108
我想他是想说“杀了他”
I think he meant "Kill him."

50
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,024
我感觉不到我的手，我的手！
I can't feel my hand. My hand.

51
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,364
我告诉过你你拿不回去了
I told you you weren't gonna get that back.

52
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,034
是的，你说过
Yeah, you did.

53
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,873
你是谁？
Who are you?

54
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,093
你的水在哪?
Where's your water?

55
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,172
他们没有水 他们本来想拿你的
They don't have none. They were gonna take yours.

56
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,134
然后吃了你，真的
And then eat you. It's true.

57
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,977
水在车里
It's in the cart.

58
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,931
你不拿走吗？
You're not taking it?

59

00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,149
我们会找到你的书
And we'll get you your book.

142
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,742
这一点，我毫不环疑
Of that I have no doubt.

143
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,337
你派出去找书的人连字都不识
You're sending guys out who can't even read to look for one book.

144
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,082
难怪他们找不到什么
Well, no wonder they never find anything.

145
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,089
是的，我手上只有这些人
Yeah, I use the tools I have at hand.

146
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,546
除非你愿意跟他们一起去？
Unless you'd like to go with them?

147
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,262
怎么处理这些？
What about these?

148
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,722
烧了
Burn them.

149
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,852
街对面的那个地方 他们有水吗？
This place across the street, they got any water?

150
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,274
有，如果你付钱的话
Yeah, if you can pay for it.

151
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,034
这个
Here.

152
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,411
你闻闻
Smell this.

153
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,670
一个手下找到的
One of the road crews found it.

154
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,878
谁知道呢？
Who knows?

155
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,723
也许这是地球上最后一瓶洗发水了
It may be the last shampoo on the planet.

156
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,562
并且是你的
And it's yours.

157
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,356
他们找到你的书了吗？
Did they find your book?

158
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,191
没有
No.

159
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,318
外来的？
Outlander?

160
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,079
让我看看手
Let me see.

161
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,165
- 好的，想喝什么？ - 水
- All right, what'll it be? - Water.

162
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,748
那是好东西
That's the good stuff.

163
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,801
我需要使用自己的配量供应 所以不便宜
I've gotta eat into my own ration to sell it, so it don't come cheap.

164
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,715
好的
Right.

165
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,142
再加一倍
Get you maybe halfway.

166
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,586
索拉娜！
Solara!

167
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,168
拿着把它装满
Take this and get it filled.

168
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,431
等等，你需要这个
Wait. You need this.

169
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,442
你能让一下吗？
Can you please move?

170
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,406
谢谢
Thank you.

171
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,177
那是我的猫
That was my cat.

172
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,844
很漂亮
Fine specimen.

173
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,980
我看见你把它打到吧台下
I saw you knock him off the bar.

174
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,854
不，我只是把它吓走 我并没有真正打它
No. I kind of shooed him, I didn't really knock him.

175
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,310
你吓唬我的猫
You raised your hand at him.

176
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,361
不会再发生了，我向你保证
Won't happen again, I promise you.

177
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,114
嘿，马兹，再来一杯如何？
Hey, Martz, how about another drink?

178
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,285
那只猫在这里两年了
That cat's been coming in here for two years.

179
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,415
它比你更有权力待在这儿
It's got more right to be here than you.

180
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,243
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

181
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,872
真可借，因为你已经...
Well, that's too bad, 'cause you got...

182
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,464
我知道你是谁
I know who you are.

183
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,973
路上残害无辜旅客的凶手
Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.

184
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,400
你会为你所做的一切付出代价的 你知道吗？
You are gonna be held to account for the things you've done, do you know that?

185
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,403
知道吗？
Do you?

186
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,232
好了
It's okay.

187
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,369
我会拿着我的东西离开这里
I'm gonna grab my things and I'm gonna walk out of here.

188
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,826
- 好的 - 好吗，兄弟？
- All right. - All right, brother?

189
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,252
好的
Yeah.

190
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,291
好
Yeah.

191
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,338
“土必为你的缘故受咒诅
"Cursed be the ground for our sake.

192
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:13,512
“地必给你长出荆棘和疾黍
"Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us.

193
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,635
“因为你本生于土 土归土
"For out of the ground, we were taken. For the dust, we are.

194
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,685
“尘归尘”
"And to the dust, we shall return."

195
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,920
住手！
Stop!

196
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,765
拜托
Please.

197
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,561
瑞德吉！
Redridge!

198
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,567
瑞德吉
Redridge.

199
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,420
你是谁？
And who are you?

200
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,673
无名之辈
Nobody.

201
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,419
我不相信
I doubt that.

202
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,473
你在我酒吧里杀的人 他们才是无名之辈
The men you killed in my bar, now, they were nobody.

203
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,135
- 但你却是个大人物 - 他的手没抖
- But you, now. - He ain't got the shakes.

204
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,687
- 他不是食人族 - 很好
- He ain't one of them. - Good.

205
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,271
这是一个文明的地方 我们不吃人类
This is a civilized town. We don't eat humans.

206
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,273
大灾难之前的人我们见的不多 现在不是了
We don't see too many people from before. Not anymore.

207
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,989
- 你读书吗？ - 每天
- Do you read? - Every day.

208
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,618
很好，对你好，我也是
All right. Well, good for you. Me, too.

209
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,915
很滑稽
You know, it's funny.

210
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:10,792
像你我这样老的人，我们是未来
As old as we are, people like you and me, we're the future.

211
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,960
你想从我这得到什么？
What do you want with me?

212
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,459
直奔王题！
Straight to the point!

213
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,259
我喜欢！
I like that!

214
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,682
你不仅仅受过教育
You're not just educated.

215
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,648
我没见过像你这样身手不凡的
I never saw anyone handle themselves the way you did.

216
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,399
我不知道你从哪里学到的 但我肯定我能用上你
I don't know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it.

217
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,403
这个小地方，只是一个开始
This little town, just the beginning.

218
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,576
我准备扩建它
I'm about to expand.

219
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,995
我需要高手的帮助 我需要像你这样的人
I need expert help. I could use someone like you.

220
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,541
谢谢，但我不感兴趣
Thank you, but I'm really not interested.

221
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,953
为我工作的人生活得 比任何行者想像的都好
Well, the people who work for me live better than any walker ever dreamed.

222
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,663
问问瑞德吉，问问这些年轻人，谁都行
Ask Redridge here. Ask the boys, anyone.

223
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,792
真正的床，热乎的饭菜，女人
Real beds, hot food, women.

224
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,504
干净的水
Clean water.

225
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,716
你可能会过得更糟，朋友
You could do a lot worse, my friend.

226
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,594
谢谢
Thank you,

227
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,765
但我需要去一个地方
but I got somewhere I need to be.

228
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,145
哪里？
Where?

229
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,439
西边
West.

230
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,775
西边什么都没有
There is nothing west.

231
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,822
有人告诉我不是这样
I've been told different.

232
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,194
谁？
By who?

233
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,039
告诉你
Tell you what.

234
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,041
在这儿过夜，感受一下当地的款待 看看你喜不喜欢
Stay the night. Try a little local hospitality, see how you like it.

235
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,543
我们早上再聊
We'll talk again in the morning.

236
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,168
听我一句，行者，你别无选择
Word of advice, Walker. It's not a choice.

237
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,470
总会有选择
It's always a choice.

238
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,637
有人会整晚待在你房外
There'll be someone outside your room all night

239
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,393
如果你需要什么
if you need anything.

240
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,065
我不需要任何东西
I don't need anything.

241
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,272
说不准
You never know.

242
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,869
这是给你的 是洗漱的水和一些吃的
This is for you. It's some water for washing and some food.

243
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,873
还有点特别的藏品 是这里王人的敬意
Little special reserve, too, compliments of the house.

244
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,002
我需要你接着这个或说点什么 这样我才能找到你
I need you to take this or say something so I can find you.

245
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,358
- 谢谢 - 不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

246
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,233
- 你还需要点什么吗？ - 不，我很好，谢谢
- Can I get you anything else? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.

247
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,316
你是在战争中失明的 还是因为之后的太阳？
Did you get blinded in the war or by the sun after?

248
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,578
我生来就这样
I was born this way.

249
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,532
我想可能是我幸运 因为在它发生的时候
I think probably I'm lucky, because I was already used to being like this

250
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,662
我就已经习惯这样了
by the time it happened.

251
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,919
是的，谢谢你的食物
Right, well, thank you for the food.

252
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,039
不客气
You're welcome.

253
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,009
我喜欢你的香水
I like your perfume.

254
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,432
不过是洗发水
It's just shampoo,

255
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,177
但是谢谢
but thank you.

256
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,181
晚安
Good night.

257
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,625
我认为他早上是不会改王意的
I don't think he's gonna change his mind by the morning.

258
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,503
他不会留下的
He's not gonna stay.

259
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,052
他跟别人不同
He's different than the others.

260
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,103
你不能像使唤别人那样 使唤他
You're not gonna be able to make him do what you want him to do.

261
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,106
谁说我要出马？
Who said anything about me?

262
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,482
我会派索拉娜去
I'll send Solara.

263
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,495
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

264
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,699
是更好地利用她的时候了
It's about time I got better use out of her.

265
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,161
不要
Don't.

266
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,413
拜托
Please.

267
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,589
求求你，不要 求求你
Please, don't. Please. Please.

268
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,925
求求你！
Please!

269
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,523
我能进来吗？
Can I come in?

270
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,735
等一下
Give me a minute.

271
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,668
已经有人拿来吃的和水
Somebody already came with food and water.

272
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,126
我需要的都有了
I got everything I need.

273
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,470
你确定吗？
Are you sure about that?

274
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,388
这里真的很亮
It's really bright in here.

275
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,224
我是索拉娜
I'm Solara.

276
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,059
是的，你刚在楼下装满了我的水壶
Right. You filled my canteen downstairs.

277
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,979
是的，你是那个行者，对吗
Yeah. You're the walker, right?

278
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,239
是
Right.

279
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,367
别担心钱 是记在这酒吧的账上的
If you're worried about paying, it's on the house.

280
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,073
付什么钱？
Paying for what?

281
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,161
你为什么不坐下来？
Why don't you take a seat?

282
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,255
不
No.

283
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,181
不，我不能走，我不能 如果我走了，他会伤害我妈妈
No, I can't go. I can't. If I do, he'll hurt my mom.

284
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,184
- 谁？ - 卡内基
- Who? - Carnegie.

285
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,399
他是你爸爸？
He's your father?

286
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,188
不，但我们都是属于他的
No. No, but we belong to him just the same.

287
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,524
我会睡在地板上
Look, I'll sleep on the floor.

288
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,238
明天告诉他 你过得很愉快
Tomorrow you can tell him you had a good time.

289
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,071
我向你保证我不会惹麻烦的
I promise you I will be no trouble.

290
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,204
求求你？
Please?

291
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,761
马走到象四
Knight to bishop four.

292
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,304
该你了
Your move.

293
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,946
你多大？
So, how old are you?

294
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,319
什么？
Excuse me?

295
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,246
我只是以前没见过多少 你这个年龄的人路过这里
It's just that I haven't really seen too many people your age come through here before.

296
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,539
自末日
Well, it's been

297
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,209
已经有30个冬天了
30 winters since the flash.

298
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,293
我真的记不清了
I really don't remember.

299
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,840
你记得那时什么样吗？ 我是说以前的世界
Do you remember what it was like? I mean, in the world before.

300
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,175
是的
Yeah.

301
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,768
那是什么样子？
Well, what was it like?

302
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,312
人们除了必需的，还拥有很多
People had more than they needed.

303
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:20,618
我们不知道哪些是珍贵的 哪些不是
We had no idea what was precious, what wasn't.

304
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,335
我们扔掉的那些东西 现在人们却要争得你死我活
We threw away things people kill each other for now.

305
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,463
- 真的？ - 是的
- Really? - Yeah.

306
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,092
你有本书
You have a book.

307
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,296
- 我可以看一下吗？ - 不，不可以
- Can I see it? - No, you cannot.

308
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,597
- 我只是想看看 - 不，我说过不行
- I just, I just wanna look at it. - No. I said no.

309
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,300
听着，我甚至不识字！ 拜托，让我看看
Listen, I can't even read! Come on, please, let me just see it.

310
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,058
你至于吗？只是本书！
What is with you? lt is just a book!

311
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,889
这不仅仅是一本书
It's not just a book.

312
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,059
- 什么意思这不只是一本书？ - 听着
- What do you mean, it's not just a book? - Look.

313
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:57,648
不要再问有关书的问题了，好吗 不要再问问题，好吧？
No more questions about the book, all right? No more questions. All right?

314
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,091
既然你在这儿，我有个问题问你
I got a question for you, since you're here.

315
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,935
我或许会回答，或许不
Well, maybe I'll answer it and maybe I won't.

316
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,730
你从哪里弄到水？
Where do you get your water?

317
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,058
不能告诉你
Can't tell you that.

318
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,270
- 你不能告诉我还是你不知道？ - 我知道
- You can't tell me or you don't know? - Oh, I know.

319
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:43,152
但是如果你不告诉我这本书 我就不告诉你水的事
But if you're not talking about the book, I'm not talking about the water.

320
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,827
你真有办法
You're something else, you know.

321
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,621
好吧，我问你另外一个问题
All right, I got another question for you.

322
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,327
好
Right.

323
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,629
你饿吗？
You hungry?

324
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,707
这儿有很多吃的
There's a lot of food there,

325
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,834
我吃不了
more than I can eat.

326
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,386
告诉你
Tell you what.

327
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,887
我们可以一起分享 就像过去老人那样
We can share it, you know, like old people used to.

328
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,012
好
Okay.

329
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,222
好吗？
Okay?

330
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,570
等等，等下，坐下
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Sit.

331
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,989
坐下
Sit.

332
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,903
这是给你的
This'll be for you.

333
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,075
把手给我
Give me your hands.

334
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,583
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

335
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,911
相信我，把手给我
Trust me. Give me your hands.

336
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,917
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

337
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,842
亲爱的主，感谢你赐给我们食物
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.

338
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,391
感谢你赐给我们温暖的床
We thank you for a warm bed

339
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,346
以及在寒冷的夜晚 我们头顶的这顶屋檐
and a roof over our head on cold nights such as this.

340
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,140
这些已经久违了
It's been too long.

341
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,066
这是从你书里来的吗？
Is this from your book?

342
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,775
别打乱，闭上你的眼睛
Don't interrupt. Close your eyes.

343
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:08,035
我们感谢你在这样艰难的时间里
We thank you for the gift of companionship

344
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,454
赐给我们友谊
in hard times like these.

345
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,699
阿门
Amen.

346
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,837
现在可以吃了吗？
Now we eat?

347
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,628
可以了
Now we eat.

348
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,157
早上好，索拉娜
Good morning, Solara.

349
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,665
昨晚如何？你睡得好吗？
How was your night? Did you sleep well?

350
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,417
我按你说的做了
I did like you said.

351
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,916
你当然会按照我说的去做
Of course you did what I said.

352
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,344
但是有用吗？他会留下吗？
But did it work? Is he staying?

353
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,348
我们没聊太多
We didn't do much talking.

354
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,510
索拉娜，亲爱的，吃点东西
Solara, honey, eat something.

355
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,019
妈，把你的手给我
Mom, give me your hand.

356
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,357
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

357
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,526
妈，相信我
Mom, trust me.

358
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,446
亲爱的主
Dear Lord.

359
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,458
我们感谢你赐予的食物
We thank you for our food.

360
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,752
感谢你赐给我母亲
Thank you for my mother.

361
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,418
感谢你赐给我们屋顶 以及我们的新朋友
Thank you for the roof over our heads and our new friends.

362
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,463
还有...
And...

363
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,892
我想目前就这么多
Well, I guess that's all for now.

364
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,898
阿门
Amen.

365
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,782
这是你要记住的词，阿门
That's the word you're looking for. Amen.

366
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,944
这是结尾
That's how you stop.

367
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,162
你说你们没聊什么
You said you didn't talk much.

368
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,466
那他读了什么没有？
But did he do any reading?

369
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,426
- 我在问你问题 - 比尔，别
- I asked you a question. - Bill, don't.

370
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,098
你，闭上你的嘴
You. Shut your mouth.

371
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,023
住手！
Stop!

372
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,779
你在伤害你的母亲，索拉娜
You're hurting your mother, Solara.

373
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,906
他说过他每天都阅读的，是吗？
He said he read every day. Did he?

374
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,365
住手！
Stop it!

375
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,373
你妈妈希望你告诉我
Your mother would like you to tell me.

376
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,950
我不知道！
I don't know!

377
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,540
我不知道！
I don't know!

378
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,965
是的，好的！是的，他在读书
Yes, okay! Yes, yes, he was reading.

379
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,881
- 他读什么样的书？ - 我不知道！
- What kind of book was he reading? - I don't know!

380
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,307
- 我不知道！是一本旧皮革的老书 - 还有呢？
- I don't know! An old leather one! - And?

381
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,393
我不知道 封面上有些东西
I don't know, it had some kind of thing on the front of it!

382
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,725
- 展示给我看 - 你得放了她
- Show me. - I need you to let her go!

383
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,276
展示给我看！
Show me!

384
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,036
瑞德吉！
Redridge!

385
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,173
妈的！他昨晚整晚都在这儿
Shit! He was here the whole night.

386
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,678
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

387
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,678
我不知...
I don't... I don't...

388
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,396
- 我只想让你务必知道... - 我明白
- I just wanna make sure that you know that... - I understand.

389
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,102
里面没有酸 是沼泽水
...there's no acid in there. That's swamp water.

390
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,108
没关系 把它们拔下来，拔下来
It doesn't matter. Just take these off. Take them off.

391
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,611
- 好的，让我，好的，只是 - 把它们拔下来
- All right. Well, let me, all right, just... - Take them off.

392
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,284
- 嘿！ - 好了，可以了，线拆下来了
- Hey! - All right. You got it, coming off.

393
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,406
- 谢谢 - 拿下来
- Thank you. - Coming off.

394
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,283
告诉他们是我让你干的，好吗
You can tell them I made you do it, all right?

395
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,363
好的
All right.

396
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,541
- 说一遍 - 你让我干的
- Say it. - You made me do it.

397
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,771
那个家伙上堂了吗？ 我想它没装子弹
Is that thing loaded? I don't think it's loaded.

398
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,943
只有一个办法能知道
One way to find out.

399
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,820
我需要那本书
Look, I need that book.

400
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,576
我需要那本书，还有你
I mean, I want the book and you,

401
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,909
但是你让我选的话 我会杀了你，拿那本书
but if you make me choose, I'll kill you, I'll take the book.

402
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,830
为什么？你为什么想要书？
Why? Why do you want it?

403
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,008
它陪伴着我长大
I grew up with it.

404
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,419
我知道它的力量
I know its power.

405
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,590
如果你阅读它，你就会有力量
And if you read it, then so do you.

406
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,427
这就是为什么战争后 他们把《圣经》都烧了
That's why they burned them all after the war.

407
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,018
只要活着就是一种信仰行为
Just staying alive is an act of faith.

408
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,395
建造这座城是一种更大的信仰行为
Building this town is an even bigger act of faith,

409
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,728
但是他们不理解
but they don't understand that,

410
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,938
没人明白
none of them.

411
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,951
我没有合适的词句帮助他们 但是这本书有
And I don't have the right words to help them, but the book does.

412
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,327
我承认
Now, I admit

413
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,000
有些事我不得不做
that I've had to do things,

414
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,671
很多我讨厌的事，比如说建这座城 我承认
many, many things, that I hate, to build this. I confess that.

415
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,708
但是如果我们有了那本书
But if we have that book,

416
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,551
我就没必要这样
I wouldn't have to.

417
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,551
想象一下
Now imagine.

418
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,223
如果有正确的词句传播我们的信念 想象一下，会有多么的不同
Imagine how different, how righteous this little world could be

419
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,645
我们的小世界将会有多少正义
if we had the right words for our faith.

420
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,394
人们会真正地明白 他们为什么在这儿，他们在做什么
The people would truly understand why they're here and what they're doing

421
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,477
他们不会再需要任何不良的动机
and they wouldn't need any of the uglier motivations.

422
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,864
藏着那本书是不对的 应该和大家一起分享
It's not right to keep that book hidden away. It's meant to be shared with others.

423
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,990
它应该被四处传播
It's meant to be spread.

424
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,367
这难道不是你想要的？
lsn't that what you want?

425
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,494
正是我内心所想
With all of my heart and soul.

426
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,495
我一直都相信
I always believed that

427
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:37,675
我要找到这本书该归属的地方 一个需要它的地方
I'd find a place where this book belonged, where it was needed.

428
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,430
但是我还没有找到
But I haven't found it yet.

429
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,770
我喜欢这个人
I love this guy.

430
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,478
我喜欢这个人
I love this guy.

431
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,360
朝他开枪
Shoot him, please.

432
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,717
你们都站在那里干什么？
What are you standing around for?

433
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,728
杀了他，该死的！杀了他！
Take him out, God damn it! Take him out!

434
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,309
我不喜欢被跟踪
I don't like being followed.

435
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,770
我想和你一起去
I wanna come with you!

436
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,476
不，你不行
No, you don't.

437
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,527
我讨厌这里
I hate it here.

438
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:49,275
- 那就改变它 - 我妈妈认为我跟你一起会更安全
- Then change it. - My mother thinks I'll be safer with you.

439
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,583
我会带你去我们取水的地方
I'll take you to where we get our water.

440
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,251
你能拿多少就拿多少
You can have all that you can carry.

441
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,672
我的意思是，我们能拿多少
I mean, all that we can carry.

442
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,268
卡内基知道北边的另外两处泉水
Carnegie knows about two more springs up north.

443
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,816
他说他会建造更多的城镇
He says he's gonna build more towns.

444
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,320
他是怎么知道这个的？
How'd he know about this one?

445
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,569
他小的时候来过这里
He'd been here when he was young.

446
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,493
在末日之前
In the world before.

447
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,034
我想其他知道这里的人都死了
I guess everyone else who knew about it died.

448
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,584
我们最好快点
We really better hurry.

449
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,926
我想我把太阳镜忘在里面了 你帮我去拿，我在这儿放哨
I think I left my glasses inside. Just take a look for me. I'll look out here.

450
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,002
好的
Okay.

451
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,390
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

452
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,107
你这个骗子
You are such a liar!

453
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,108
我不是骗子
I'm not a liar.

454
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,986
你说过如果你拿到水 我就可以跟你走
You said I could come with you if you got your water!

455
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,489
我没说过，是你说的
I didn't say that. You said that.

456
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,488
另外，路上不安全
Besides, the road's no place for you.

457
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,248
比你想象的糟得多
It's much worse than you think.

458
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,702
再见，索拉娜 很高兴认识你，我是诚心的
Goodbye, Solara. It's nice knowing you, I mean that.

459
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,958
- 嘿 - 什么？
- Hey. - Yeah?

460
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,048
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

461
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,558
你那他妈的脏手洗过了吗？
Have you washed your filthy fucking hands?

462
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,359
两遍，用肥皂洗的
Twice. With your soap.

463
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,900
叫一队人，我们跟在他后面
Put a crew together. We're going after him.

464
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,451
为了那本他妈的书
For a fucking book.

465
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,029
那不是本他妈的书！
It's not a fucking book!

466
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,657
是武器！
It's a weapon!

467
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,792
一件可以让心灵和思想 不再软弱和绝望的武器！
A weapon aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate!

468
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,215
它能让我们控制他们！
It will give us control of them!

469
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:17,174
如果我们要控制更多的城 我们必须拿到它！
If we wanna rule more than one small fucking town, we have to have it!

470
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,435
人们会聚集到这里 我们让他们做什么，他们都会做
People will come from all over, they'll do exactly what I tell them

471
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,013
如果我们说的话是这本书里的
if the words are from the book.

472
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:33,526
以前就发生过 以后还会发生的
It's happened before, and it'll happen again.

473
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,482
我们只需要那本书
All we need is that book.

474
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,923
我想要索拉娜
Then I want Solara.

475
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,173
你在跟我讨价还价吗？
Are you bargaining with me?

476
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,260
我们是在这儿做交易吗？
Is this a deal we're making here?

477
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,393
我们失去了很多人手
We lost a lot of men.

478
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,067
你现在更需要我
You need me more than ever.

479
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:15,231
你说那本书值得为之付出努力 那我相信你
Now, you say that book's worth the trouble. Well, I believe you,

480
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,652
但作为交换，我要索拉娜
but I want Solara for it.

481
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,300
为什么不？
Why not? Why not?

482
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,095
让我们离开这该死的地方
Let's get the fuck out of here.

483
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:46,937
待在这儿，这不关你的事 待在这儿，这不关你的事
Stay on the path. It's not your concern. Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

484
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,089
我们应该走哪条路？
Which way are we headed?

485
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,841
西边的
West.

486
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,503
喂，你好？
Hello?

487
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,673
可以帮帮我吗？
Can anyone help me?

488
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,472
嘿，有人在吗？
Hello? Is anybody there?

489
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,608
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

490
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,608
是的，我很好，你走吧，我会没事的
Yes. I'm fine. You go along. I'll be okay.

491
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,945
- 不，这里，让我帮帮你 - 不用了，谢谢，我真的很好
- No, no, here, let me just help you. - No, really, please. I'm fine. Really.

492
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,371
我需要一个男的来帮我不是你 你走吧
I need a man to help, not you. You just go along.

493
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,504
- 没关系，几分钟就可以了 - 不，没关系
- It's okay, it'll just take a minute. - No! It's fine. Please.

494
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,364
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

495
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,997
放开我！
Get off me!

496
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,081
谢谢！
Thank you!

497
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,669
那边
Over there.

498
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,634
怎么了？
What's wrong?

499
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,174
你听见了？
You hear that?

500
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,809
听见什么？
Hear what?

501
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,353
别动，别动！
Don't move. Don't move.

502
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,284
这里，把弓丝拿下来
Here. Take the wire off of that.

503
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,415
绕到线轴上
Spool it up.

504
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,915
- 那是什么？ - 晚餐
- What is that? - Dinner.

505
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,275
感觉好像有什么在保佑他
It's like he's protected somehow,

506
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,109
好像没人可以伤害他
like there's nothing that can touch him.

507
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,029
他只是一个他妈的人
He's just a fucking man.

508
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,371
如果你射他一枪 他会像其他人一样倒下
You put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other.

509
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,960
还是热的
Still warm.

510
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,713
刚死没几个小时
No more than a few hours dead.

511
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,017
他不可能走远
He can't be far.

512
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,106
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

513
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:13,740
索拉娜
Solara.

514
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,577
你确定你还想要她？
Are you sure you still want her?

515
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,712
天快黑了，我们晚上跟踪不了他们 他们会看到我们的
It's gonna be dark soon. We can't track them at night, they'll see us coming.

516
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,086
或许越过了他们，却还不知道
We could drive right past them and never know it.

517
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,250
他是对的
He's right.

518
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,595
他们会走累的，他们需要休息
They're on foot, tired. They'll have to sleep.

519
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,853
我们明天再上路 中午之前就会抓到他们
We'll make up the ground tomorrow. We'll have them before morning's out.

520
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,439
最好万无一失
That better be a guarantee.

521
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,664
你真的每天都读同一本书吗？
Do you really read the same book every day?

522
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,210
无一例外
Without fail.

523
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,084
你会读点儿给我听吗？
Will you read some to me?

524
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,012
可以吗
Please?

525
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,554
“耶和华是我的牧者

- 是你写的吗？ - 是的
- Did you write that? - Yes, I did.

真的？
Really?

536
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,977
不，不是
No, no. No.

537
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,363
它很久以前就有了 比你我来到这个世上都早
No, that was around a long time before you and I got here, that's for sure.

538
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,493
你说它不是普通的书，是什么意思？
What did you mean when you said it's not just any book?

539
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,254
它是唯一的
It's the only one.

540

真的？
Really?

战争后，人们开始

01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:47,222
寻找并销毁大火中幸存的书
to find and destroy any that the fires didn't get already.

543
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,477
有人说这是导致战争的原因
Some people said this was the reason for the war in the first place.

544
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,648
无论如何，这是唯一保存下来的一本了
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.

545
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,815
你是怎么拿到它的？
How'd you get it?

他们说战争
They said that the war

01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:27,551
你很幸运在这样的洞里或地下藏起来
You were lucky to hole up and hide in a place like this or underground.

553
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,309
大多数的人就没那么幸运了
Most people weren't lucky.

554
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,816
一年以后，我们从地下出来
So, a year later, we started coming out,

555
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,571
人们徘徊着
and people wandered around.

556
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:46,528
我不知道要做什么 只想找个地方活下来
I, not knowing what I was gonna do, trying to find a place to survive.

557
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,539
一天我听到了一个声音
One day, I heard a voice.

558
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,790
很难解释，但它听起来像
It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

559
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,747
好像从我内心深处发出来的
Like it was coming from inside of me.

560
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,878
但我可以听到它 就好像我听到你跟我说话这样清楚
But I could hear it as clear as I can hear you talking to me now.

561
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,387
那个声音说了什么？
What did this voice say?

562
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,264
它指引我
It led me

563
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,723
去一个地方，我找到了这本书
to a place where I found the book

564
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,266
埋在一些碎石下面
buried under some rubble.

565
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:21,024
那个声音告诉我把这本书带到西方
The voice told me to carry the book out west.

566
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:26,155
告诉我有条路会指引我
Told me that a path would be laid out for me,

567
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,830
我会被带到一个 使这本书会安全的地方
that I'd be led to a place where the book was safe.

568
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,752
它告诉我，会有人保佑我
Told me that I'd be protected

569
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:41,340
任何人或事都阻碍不了我前进
against anyone or anything that stood in my path.

570
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,926
我从那时起就一直在走
I've been walking ever since.

571
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:52,268
你这么做的原因就是 因为你听到的一个声音告诉你的？
And you did all that because a voice in your head told you to?

572
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,437
是的
Yes, I did.

573
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,060
我清楚当时我听到了什么
I know what I heard.

574
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,225
我也清楚现在我所听到的
I know what I hear.

575
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,568
我知道我没疯
I know I'm not crazy.

576
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,444
我知道没有他的保佑，我永远不会成功
And I know I would've never made it without help.

577
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:09,323
- 那是什么？ - 太多问题了
- What's that? - One question too many.

578
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,906
睡觉吧 我们早上要很早上路
Go to bed, we got an early start in the morning.

579
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,660
嘿
Hey.

580
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:04,798
嘿
Hey.

581
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,515
凯马特-你好，我叫艾利

582
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,928
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

583
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,806
- 抱歉，我以为你在睡觉 - 我没睡
- I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping. - I wasn't sleeping.

584
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,641
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

585
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,814
我只是想看看那本书
I just wanted to see the book.

586
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,863
除了我谁也不能碰它，你明白吗？
Nobody touches it but me, you understand me?

587
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,069
你听明白了吗？
Do you understand me?

588
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,867
- 是的.我明白 - 好的.去睡觉
- Yes, I understand. - Good. Go to sleep.

589
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,751
你说过你不认识字 它对你没有用
You said you don't know how to read anyway. It's no use to you.

590
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:45,922
是的
Yeah.

591
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,379
那教我读
So teach me.

592
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,777
等等！停！
Hold up. Hold up! Stop!

593
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,956
你说你已经走了30年了，是吗？
You know, you say you've been walking for 30 years, right?

594
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,249
是的
Right.

595
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,376
你想过你可能迷路了吗？
Have you ever thought that maybe you were lost?

596
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,578
没有
Nope.

597
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,005
你怎么知道你走的方向是正确的？
Well, how do you know that you're walking in the right direction?

598
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,549
“我们行事为人，是凭着信心 不是凭着眼见”
"We walk by faith, not by sight."

599
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,801
那是什么意思？
What does that mean?

600
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:34,506
是你知道它是正确的 尽管还没有被证明
It means that you know something, even if you don't know something.

601
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,680
这完全说不通
That doesn't make any sense.

602
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,724
没必要说得通，这是信仰 是信仰
Doesn't have to make sense, it's faith. It's faith.

603
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,804
在一片漆黑里，这是光亮的花朵
It's the flower of light in the field of darkness

604
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,355
给了我前进的力量，你明白吗？
that's giving me the strength to carry on. You understand?

605
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,682
这是书里的？
Is that from your book?

606
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,736
不，是强尼卡什在福尔松监狱的演唱
No, it's Johnny Cash live at Folsom Prison.

607
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,528
什么？
What?

608
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,510
- 你认为有人住在那里吗？ - 不知道
- Do you think anyone lives there? - I don't know.

609
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,967
也许那儿有水
Maybe there's water.

610
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,400
待在我后面
Stay behind me.

611
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:36,485
禁止擅自闯入

612
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,111
这有点奇怪
This is weird.

613
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,689
你们是谁？
Who are you?

614
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,196
我们只是过路的 不是坏人
We're travelers, that's all. Don't mean any harm.

615
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,123
禁止擅自闯入！你没看到标志吗？
No trespassing! Haven't you read the sign?

616
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,456
对不起，我没看到
We're very sorry. I didn't see it.

617
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,128
你在这儿干什么？
What's your business?

618
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,295
- 是... - 没事！
- We were just... - No business!

619
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,797
只是，我们非常抱歉 如果你们允许，我们这就离开
Just... We're very sorry, and if you let us, we'll be on our way.

620
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,880
乔治，看他们 其中一个只是个小姑娘
George, look at them. One of them is just a girl.

621
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,888
是的，老生常谈 我已经听过无数遍了
Yeah. It's an old story, I've heard it a hundred times before.

622
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,389
我们最近很少有访客来 乔治有点疑神疑鬼
We get so few visitors these days. George is suspicious of everybody.

623
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,396
我是玛莎，你们想喝点茶吗？
I'm Martha. Would you care for some tea?

624
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,031
来点音乐如何？旋律很放松
How about some music? It's so soothing.

625
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,957
乔治！
George!

626
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,431
你觉得怎么样？很好听，请喝
How do you like it? It's nice. Please.

627
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,117
一好喝吗？ - 很好，味道很浓郁
- Is that good? - Good, good. That's... Taste is rich.

628
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,546
你们两个能互相依赖活到现在，真了不起
It's amazing that you two have survived out here all by yourselves.

629
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,874
乔治是一个能工巧匠
Well, now, George is something of a handyman.

630
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:02,547
他为这个地方干了很多活 使这里更安全
He did a lot of work on this place, making it safe.

631
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,258
我们也许老了，但我们适应性很强
We may be old, but we're resilient.

632
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,928
我们遇到很多人 想从我们这儿抢走这个地方
We've known more than a few who've tried to take this place from us.

633
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,184
- 没错吧，乔治？ 是的，我们遇到过
- Haven't we, George? - Yes, we have.

634
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,891
- 是的 - 我给你们看点东西，过来
- Right. - I wanna show you something. Come on.

635
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,227
乔治，别！现在不行!
George, no! Not now!

636
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,479
过来!
Come on!

637
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,359
- 这些是... - 坟墓？当然
- Are these... - Graves? Sure.

638
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,823
不埋葬他们很不文明
Be uncivilized not to bury them.

639
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,327
另外，这对土地有好处
Besides, it's good for the soil.

640
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,785
快进来，我想我可能会 给你们做点三明治
Come on back inside. I think I might be able to rustle you up some sandwiches.

641
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,166
谢谢，非常感谢
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

642
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,793
- 得走了 - 他们把这些人都杀了
- We gotta go now. - They killed all these people.

643
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,465
不只杀了他们，还吃了他们
They didn't just kill them, they ate them.

644
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,464
- 她的手，她的手在抖 - 太多人肉了，我们走
- Her hands... Her hands were shaking. - Too much human meat. Let's go.

645
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,846
我找到了些肉，我想你们饿了
I found some meat. I hope you're hungry.

646
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,553
没有，谢谢
Nope. No, thank you.

647
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,431
我们得走了
Well, we... We gotta be going.

648
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,729
- 这么快？ - 是的，很抱歉
- So soon? - Yeah, I'm afraid so.

649
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,432
- 你确定你不留下？ - 我肯定，非常肯定
- Are you sure you won't stay? - I'm sure, I'm very sure.

650
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,313
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

651
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,273
索拉娜，你拿着这个 把门打开
Solara, you take this. Open the door for us, please.

652
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,480
- 索拉娜，说感谢你的茶 - 感谢你的茶
- Solara, say thank you for the tea. - Thank you for the tea.

653
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,780
非常感谢你的茶
Thank you so much for the tea.

654
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,286
回到里面去
Go back inside.

655
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,291
乔治，怎么了？
George, what's wrong?

656
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,794
一群武装的强盗
Whole company of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong!

657
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,420
他们把他们引到这里
And they led them straight to us.

658
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,844
- 我刚摆好瓷器 - 去他妈的瓷器！
- I just set out the good china. - Fuck the china!

659
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,137
你还有其他武器吗？
Have you got any more weapons?

660
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,931
武器？给你看看我的武器
Weapons? I'll show you some weapons.

661
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,687
- 你会开枪吗？ - 当然
- Can you shoot a gun? - Of course.

662
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,856
快！快！
Come on, come on!

663
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,151
我们知道你们在里面！
We know you're in there!

664
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,855
出来没人会受伤！
Come on out and nobody needs to get hurt!

665
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,486
我会放你一马！
I'll make it easy!

666
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,577
把索拉娜和书交出来！
Send out Solara with the book!

667
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,584
- 我们怎么办？ - 我知道我他妈的在干什么！
- What are we gonna do? - I know what the fuck I'm doing!

668
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,461
- 等等 - 我只想要这两样，书和姑娘！
- Wait, wait, wait. - That's all I want, the book and the girl!

669
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,126
他们不会出来
They ain't coming out.

670
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,623
该死！趴下！大家趴下！
Shit! Get down! Everybody, get down!

671
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,765
嘿！你听到的那个声音
Hey! You know that voice you heard?

672
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,811
它有没有告诉你这件事？
Did it say anything about this?

673
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,311
我们会活着出去的，我们俩个！
We'll get out alive, both of us!

674
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,975
那我们昵？
What about us?

675
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,519
没提到你们！
Didn't mention you!

676
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,946
停止开火！
Cease fire!

677
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,198
停止开火！
Cease fire!

678
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,878
玛莎？玛莎？
Martha? Martha?

679
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:32,010
玛莎！玛莎！
Martha! Martha!

680
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,266
- 玛莎 - 到边上去！到那边！
- Martha. - Go in on the side! Over on the side!

681
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,813
你们这帮混蛋！
You bastards!

682
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,604
- 在房子的侧面！ - 你们他妈的这帮混蛋！
- The side of the house! - You fucking bastards!

683
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,364
- 别开枪！别开枪！ - 他们在干什么？
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire! - What are they doing?

684
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,115
没有好事
Nothing good.

685
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,687
书在哪儿？
Where's the book?

686
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,158
看看他的包
Check his pack.

687
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,299
不在这儿
It ain't here.

688
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:45,940
这是你最后的机会 不交出书，我就把你埋在这儿
This is your last chance. You give it up or I swear I'll bury you out here.

689
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,319
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

690
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,450
我们再试试
Let's try this again.

691
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,126
- 卡内基！ - 什么？
- Carnegie! - What?

692
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,799
书在哪儿？
Now, where's the book?

693
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,060
把书给他吧，拜托
Give him the book, please.

694
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,521
别告诉他
Don't tell him.

695
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,784
在房子里，电视机后面
It's in the house, back of the TV.

696
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,587
检查电视机！
Go check the TV!

697
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,501
什么？
The what?

698
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,677
你他妈的在开什么玩笑！你，去！
You're fucking shitting me. You, go! Go!

699
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,258
无论求什么，只要信，就必得着
Ask, and you shall receive.

700
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,632
上帝是好人，是吗？
God is good, is he not?

701
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,643
一直是
All the time.

702
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,639
不是一直
Not all the time.

703
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,921
不！不！
No! No!

704
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,756
你现在明白了？
You see?

705
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,681
我怎么告诉你的？
What did I tell you?

706
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,309
他只是个人
He's just a man.

707
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,815
不！把他放了！
No! Leave him alone!

708
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,117
求求你，住手！
Please, stop!

709
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,827
你的保护神在哪?
Where's your protection now?

710
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,305
为我祈祷
Pray for me.

711
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,896
可以吗？
Okay?

712
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:02,021
我认真的
I mean it.

713
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,315
不！
No!

714
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,487
狗屎！
Shit!

715
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,407
回去！
Go back!

716
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,040
快！快！
Come on! Come on!

717
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,687
我们剩的油刚刚可以回去 你想去追她吗？
We barely got enough fuel to make it back. You wanna go after her?

718
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,144
不
No.

719
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:50,893
- 你要往哪儿走？ - 我要去西边，必须去西边
- Where are you going? - I'm going west. Gotta go west.

720
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,695
嘿！
Hey!

721
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,030
来
Here.

722
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,556
对不起
I'm sorry.

723
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,558
对不起什么？
For what?

724
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,473
- 这，这都是我的错 - 不，不是的
- This. This is all my fault. - No, it's not.

725
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:30,807
不，是我的错，如果我不跟着你 这些就不会发生了
No, it is. If I didn't come with you, none of this would've happened.

726
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,393
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

727
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,814
我做了必须要做的事
I did what I had to do.

728
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:41,367
我认为任何事情都不能使你放弃那本书
I didn't think anything could make you give up that book.

729
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,911
我以为它太重要了
I thought it was too important.

730
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,585
这么多年，我背着它 每天阅读
All the years I've been carrying it and reading it every day.

731
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,336
我只痴迷于想保护它
I got so caught up with keeping it safe,

732
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,716
我忘了靠从中学到的去生活
I forgot to live by what I learned from it.

733
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,760
是的，那是什么？
Yeah, and what's that?

734
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:04,928
只是...
Just...

735
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,390
帮助他人要多于帮助自己
Do for others more than you do for yourself.

736
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,311
这是我从中学到的
That's what I got from it, anyway.

737
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,447
你闻到7吗？
You smell that?

738
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,328
- 什么？ - 空气中的味道？
- What? - In the air?

739
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,663
盐？
Salt?

740
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,870
我们靠近大海了
We're getting close to the ocean.

741
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:19,775
到了
That's it.

742
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,469
把机械师叫来！
Get the Engineer!

743
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:28,233
别再靠近！
That's far enough!

744
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,616
你们在这里干什么？
What's your business here?

745
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,657
我叫艾利
My name is Eli!

746
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,407
我有一本英王詹姆士版的圣经
I have a King James Bible in my possession.

747
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:39,991
待在那里！
Remain where you are!

748
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:44,170
别试图有什么动作 否则就开枪！
Don't attempt to make any sudden moves, or you will be fired upon!

749
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:04,432
小心！小心！
Be careful with it. Be careful.

750
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,857
小心
Careful with it.

751
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,452
他们没有武器
They're clean.

752
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,590
我们做这件事已经很久了
We've been doing this for a long time now.

753
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,095
- 感觉像一座博物馆 - 不是，比博物馆更好
- Feels like a museum. - No, it's much more than that.

754
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,344
这里是我们重新开始的地方
This is where we're going to start again.

755
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:41,849
我们有一个印刷机 它很快就可以工作了
We've got a printing press. It'll be operational quite soon.

756
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:45,352
我们准备教导人们 让他们了解那个失去的世界
We're going to teach people about the world they lost.

757
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,650
帮助他们重建
Help them start to rebuild it.

758
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:52,151
我是指，你看，莎士比亚 大百科全书，只少了几卷
I mean, look. Shakespeare. Britannica, missing only a few volumes.

759
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:56,151
这是一整套莫扎特和瓦格纳的唱片
There's a whole series of beautiful Mozart and Wagner records

760
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,486
还保存得很好
in still very pristine condition.

761
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:01,288
但就是没有圣经，不过现在有了
But never a Bible. Well, not until now.

762
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:05,122
我能问一下它是什么状况？
Well, may I ask what condition it's in?

763
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,295
它很破旧了
It's beat up,

764
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:11,123
但还能用
but it will do the job.

765
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,881
- 我可以看一下吗？ - 是的，可以
- Do you think I could see it? - Yes, you may.

766
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,142
- 好了，打开了 - 你打开了吗？
- That's it. It's open. - You there?

767
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,303
你有什么要写的吗？
Do you have anything to write on?

768
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,352
可以给我们一些纸吗？
Could you get us some writing paper, please?

769
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,603
很多纸
And a lot of it.

770
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,812
很多很多
A whole lot of it.

771
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,227
难以置信
It can't be.

772
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:14,854
这...
It...

773
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,577
这不可能！
It's impossible!

774
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,701
这不可能！
It can't be!

775
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,371
仔细点记下
Pay close attention and write down

776
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,882
我说的每一句话
everything I say

777
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,007
我说的每个字
exactly as I say it.

778
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,768
“摩西的第一卷书

797
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,039
在外面
Out there.

她自己选的

799
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,417
我试图把她带回来，她拒绝了
I tried to bring her back. She refused.

她拒绝后你做了什么？

- 读！ - 你对我女儿做了什么？
- Read it! - What did you do to my daughter?

803
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:16,081
你准备好就可以开始了
You can start anytime.

804
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:25,928

太久了，我不记得了
It's been so long, I don't remember.

806
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:41,569
- 你必须记得 - 必须？是吗？
- You have to. - I have to? Really?

807
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:44,234
不，你必须记得，拜托
No, no, no, no. You have to. Please.

808
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,152
你的腿
Your leg.

809
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:52,495
它已经不疼了
It doesn't hurt anymore.

810
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,741
我能闻到
I can smell it.

811
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,013
你为了那本书这么努力
You worked so hard for that book.

812
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:17,264
你牺牲了这么多人
You sacrificed so much, so many men.

813
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,771
现在连保护你的人都没了
More than you could spare.

814
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:27,774
以前那些怕你的人 连你的名字都不敢说
Now all those people who were too scared to even say your name,

815
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,116
他们现在就在楼下，正在破坏酒吧呢 你知道吗？
they're downstairs, tearing up the bar right now. Did you know that?

816
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:35,323
没有人去阻止他们
And there's no one there to stop them.

817
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:38,455
而你却病了
And you're feverish.

818
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:44,882
我想象不出那种感受 梦寐以求的书就在眼前
I can't imagine what it must feel like to have what you want so close

819
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,632
- 而你却无从解读它 - 闭嘴！
- and it might as well be a million miles away. - Stop it!

820
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,924
你要离开我吗？
Are you leaving me?

821
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:57,853
克劳迪娅？
Claudia?

822
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:01,682
克劳迪娅？
Claudia?

823
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,521
克劳迪娅！
Claudia!

824
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,132
走开！
Get away! Get away!
