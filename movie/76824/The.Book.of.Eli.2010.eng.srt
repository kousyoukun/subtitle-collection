1
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,577
Nice.

2
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,329
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,008
You hungry?

4
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,178
You know, you gotta come get
it. Don't play hard to get.

5
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,805
You'll like it.

6
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,183
It's cat.

7
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,978
There you go.

8
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,982
I don't know what...

9
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,154
Leave room for breakfast.

10
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,847

11
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,169
Hello?

12
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,549

13
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,811
Please. Don't hurt me.

14
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,479
Here, take anything you want.

15
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,233
You want some food? Take it.

16
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,321
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Yeah?

17
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,532
That's what the last guy said.

18
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,705
Could... Could you help
me? The wheel came off.

19
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,249
I can't fix it.

20
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:16,045
Maybe if I... If I could, but I can't.

21
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,092
You know, the only good thing about no soap

22
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,804
is that you can smell hijackers a mile off.

23
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,349
I am impressed!

24
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:33,813
This man smelled us from 30 feet away!

25
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,982
Damn!

26
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,110
What's that say about our hygiene?

27
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,239
What you got there in that pack?

28
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,741
What pack?

29
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,243
He got a gun.

30
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,871
Shit, it ain't loaded.

31
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,707
They never are.

32
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,335
Ain't that right, old man?

33
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,968
Open the pack and tip it out
on the road, nice and slow.

34
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,263
Can't do that.

35
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,771
Take off the fucking pack
and put it on the ground.

36
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,148
Or die!

37
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,196
Are you listening to me?

38
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,989
I am now.

39
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,867
- Good.
- You listening to me?

40
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,036
- Yeah.
- Good.

41
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,663
Put that hand on me again,
you won't get it back.

42
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,295
Do you believe this fucking guy?

43
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,090
All right, you wanna do it the hard way.

44
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,599
How'd you do that?

45
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,060
He just cut my hand off!

46
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,944
What are you standing around for? Kiss him!

47
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,863
What did he say?

48
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,490
He's in shock.

49
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,120
I think he meant "Kill him."

50
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,027
I can't feel my hand. My hand.

51
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,367
I told you you weren't gonna get that back.

52
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,042
Yeah, you did.

53
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,885
Who are you?

54
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,097
Where's your water?

55
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,183
They don't have none. They
were gonna take yours.

56
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,144
And then eat you. It's true.

57
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,985
It's in the cart.

58
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,934
You're not taking it?

59
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,771
- Where are you going?
- West.

60
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,190
- Can I come with you?
- No.

61
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,610
But...

62
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,393
We'll find shelter for tonight.

63
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,270
My legs still hurt.

64
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,565
God.

65
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,828
No! No!

66
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,122
- Nice shot!
- Mike! No!

67
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,753
- No!
- We got her.

68
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,756
Honey? Come here!

69
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,676
No, no.

70
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,304
- Please, don't. Please, God, no!
- Stay on the path.

71
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,807
- Stop!
- Hey, guys.

72
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,936
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

73
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,729
No!

74
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,314
Come on!

75
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:55,027
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

76
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,315
- I don't know you.
- I know, I'm not from around here.

77
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,817
No shit you're not from around here.

78
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,194
- All right, I don't want any trouble.
- Oh, yeah.

79
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,739
Okay.

80
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,244
I'm just a customer. Okay?

81
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,912
Okay.

82
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,543
I'm sorry, I gotta see the hands.

83
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,879
I'm not one of them.

84
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,923
Okay.

85
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,843
I'm gonna take something out of my pack.

86
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,596
- Take your finger off the trigger.
- Yeah.

87
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,483
Sweet! That's a Fathom 900, man.

88
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,860
Is it?

89
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,862
I haven't seen one of those since the '90s.

90
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,363
Yeah, I got it back east.

91
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,865
- Still work?
- Yeah. Yeah. Just need it charged.

92
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,286
Can you do that for me?
Give me a... I got cables.

93
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,372
I don't need the cables. I can put a
trickle charger on it, though, for you.

94
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,665
Good.

95
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,376
I mean, if you got the coin.

96
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,295
Yes, sir.

97
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,550
Yes, I do. I got something...

98
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,513
- Okay.
- It's American-made.

99
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,765
Oh, yeah. I got a whole bunch of these.

100
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,975
- Do you?
- Yeah.

101
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,768
How about ChapStick? You got any ChapStick?

102
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,939
No ChapStick, no. I got
cat oil. Fresh cat oil.

103
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,400
- No, no.
- It's good, it's good for the...

104
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,152
- No, no.
- Works the same way.

105
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,571
What about toys? You got any toys?

106
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,115
No, I don't play... Oh, I got...

107
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,412
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- We do chicken right.

108
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,748
- Eh, finger lickin' good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

109
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,666
All right, all right, all right.

110
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,419
All right, now this, with these.

111
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,254
Absolutely, those are yours.

112
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,715
Okay. Give me a couple of hours.

113
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,216
- Charge it up for you.
- Thank you.

114
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,886
You can wait over there across
the street, at the Orpheum.

115
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,679
No, I'll wait here.

116
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,682
- Bar is about ready to open.
- I'll wait here.

117
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,310
You don't trust me, do you?

118
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,524
- I'll wait here.
- All right.

119
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,559

120
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,106
Carnegie.

121
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,444
One of the road crews just pulled into
town. They've got something for you.

122
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,279
Books?

123
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,948
Whole bag of them.

124
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,577
Tell them I wanna see them right now.

125
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,419
- Stay.
- No problem.

126
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,629
Come on, let's go.

127
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,801
We did good.

128
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,399
The one you want, it ain't there?

129
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,944
No.

130
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,406
I just don't understand.
That's a shitload of books.

131
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,159
You don't have to understand.

132
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,997
I understand. Leave that to
me and we can be friends.

133
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,500
I have faith in you. You'll find it.

134
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,465
Wait. I got this, too.

135
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,432
Now, this is a treat.

136
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,604
- That's shampoo.
- Yeah?

137
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,565
Go get slammed.

138
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,193
Get some pussy.

139
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,238
Everything on me, as much as
you and your boys can stand.

140
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,824
Then go back on the road.

141
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,160
And we'll get you your book.

142
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,746
Of that I have no doubt.

143
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,340
You're sending guys out who can't
even read to look for one book.

144
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,094
Well, no wonder they never find anything.

145
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,097
Yeah, I use the tools I have at hand.

146
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,557
Unless you'd like to go with them?

147
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,273
What about these?

148
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,733
Burn them.

149
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,863
This place across the
street, they got any water?

150
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,285
Yeah, if you can pay for it.

151
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,042
Here.

152
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,419
Smell this.

153
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,678
One of the road crews found it.

154
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,889
Who knows?

155
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,727
It may be the last shampoo on the planet.

156
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,566
And it's yours.

157
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,364
Did they find your book?

158
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,202
No.

159
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,330
Outlander?

160
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,082
Let me see.

161
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,172
- All right, what'll it be?
- Water.

162
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,760
That's the good stuff.

163
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,804
I've gotta eat into my own ration
to sell it, so it don't come cheap.

164
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,723
Right.

165
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,149
Get you maybe halfway.

166
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,590
Solara!

167
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,179
Take this and get it filled.

168
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,435
Wait. You need this.

169
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,454
Can you please move?

170
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,418
Thank you.

171
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,184
That was my cat.

172
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,856
Fine specimen.

173
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,984
I saw you knock him off the bar.

174
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,862
No. I kind of shooed him,
I didn't really knock him.

175
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,322
You raised your hand at him.

176
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,365
Won't happen again, I promise you.

177
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,118
Hey, Martz, how about another drink?

178
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,289
That cat's been coming in here for two years.

179
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,418
It's got more right to be here than you.

180
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,254
I don't want any trouble.

181
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,884
Well, that's too bad, 'cause you got...

182
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,476
I know who you are.

183
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,980
Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.

184
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,403
You are gonna be held to account for the
things you've done, do you know that?

185
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,406
Do you?

186
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,243
It's okay.

187
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,376
I'm gonna grab my things and
I'm gonna walk out of here.

188
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,837
- All right.
- All right, brother?

189
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,255
Yeah.

190
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,299

191
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,341
"Cursed be the ground for our sake.

192
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:13,515
"Both thorns and thistles it
shall bring forth for us.

193
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,646
"For out of the ground, we were
taken. For the dust, we are.

194
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,693
"And to the dust, we shall return."

195
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,931
Stop!

196
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,768
Please.

197
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,573
Redridge!

198
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,575
Redridge.

199
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,424
And who are you?

200
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,676
Nobody.

201
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,430
I doubt that.

202
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,476
The men you killed in my
bar, now, they were nobody.

203
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,146
- But you, now.
- He ain't got the shakes.

204
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,690
- He ain't one of them.
- Good.

205
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,278
This is a civilized town.
We don't eat humans.

206
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,283
We don't see too many people
from before. Not anymore.

207
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,996
- Do you read?
- Every day.

208
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,625
All right. Well, good for you. Me, too.

209
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,919
You know, it's funny.

210
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:10,799
As old as we are, people like
you and me, we're the future.

211
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,968
What do you want with me?

212
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,470
Straight to the point!

213
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,765
I like that!

214
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,267

215
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,690
You're not just educated.

216
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,652
I never saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did.

217
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:35,407
I don't know where you learned it,
but I sure as hell could use it.

218
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,411
This little town, just the beginning.

219
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,579
I'm about to expand.

220
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,999
I need expert help. I
could use someone like you.

221
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,544
Thank you, but I'm really not interested.

222
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,964
Well, the people who work for me live
better than any walker ever dreamed.

223
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,675
Ask Redridge here. Ask the boys, anyone.

224
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,803
Real beds, hot food, women.

225
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,516
Clean water.

226
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,728
You could do a lot worse, my friend.

227
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,606
Thank you,

228
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,776
but I got somewhere I need to be.

229
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,153
Where?

230
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,447
West.

231
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,782
There is nothing west.

232
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,826
I've been told different.

233
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,202
By who?

234
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,043
Tell you what.

235
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:33,048
Stay the night. Try a little local
hospitality, see how you like it.

236
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,550
We'll talk again in the morning.

237
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,179
Word of advice, Walker. It's not a choice.

238
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,475
It's always a choice.

239
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,649
There'll be someone outside
your room all night

240
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,400
if you need anything.

241
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,069
I don't need anything.

242
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,279
You never know.

243
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,876
This is for you. It's some
water for washing and some food.

244
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,880
Little special reserve, too,
compliments of the house.

245
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,013
I need you to take this or say
something so I can find you.

246
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,362
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

247
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,240
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

248
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,326
Did you get blinded in the
war or by the sun after?

249
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,582
I was born this way.

250
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,543
I think probably I'm lucky, because I
was already used to being like this

251
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,670
by the time it happened.

252
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,923
Right, well, thank you for the food.

253
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,050
You're welcome.

254
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,013
I like your perfume.

255
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,436
It's just shampoo,

256
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,189
but thank you.

257
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,193
Good night.

258
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,637
I don't think he's gonna change
his mind by the morning.

259
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,515
He's not gonna stay.

260
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,063
He's different than the others.

261
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,109
You're not gonna be able to make
him do what you want him to do.

262
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,113
Who said anything about me?

263
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,493
I'll send Solara.

264
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,499
You can't do that.

265
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,710
It's about time I got better use out of her.

266
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,172
Don't.

267
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,424
Please.

268
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,596
Please, don't. Please. Please.

269
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,933
Please!

270
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,530
Can I come in?

271
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,742
Give me a minute.

272
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,671
Somebody already came with food and water.

273
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,134
I got everything I need.

274
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,473
Are you sure about that?

275
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,396
It's really bright in here.

276
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,232
I'm Solara.

277
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:05,069
Right. You filled my canteen downstairs.

278
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,990
Yeah. You're the walker, right?

279
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,242
Right.

280
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:18,374
If you're worried about
paying, it's on the house.

281
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,084
Paying for what?

282
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,172
Why don't you take a seat?

283
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
No.

284
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,189
No, I can't go. I can't. If
I do, he'll hurt my mom.

285
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,192
- Who?
- Carnegie.

286
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,403
He's your father?

287
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,199
No. No, but we belong to him just the same.

288
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,535
Look, I'll sleep on the floor.

289
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,245
Tomorrow you can tell him
you had a good time.

290
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,082
I promise you I will be no trouble.

291
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,212
Please?

292
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,764
Knight to bishop four.

293
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,315
Your move.

294
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,950
So, how old are you?

295
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,327
Excuse me?

296
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,249
It's just that I haven't really seen too many
people your age come through here before.

297
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,543
Well, it's been

298
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,216
30 winters since the flash.

299
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,304
I really don't remember.

300
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:00,852
Do you remember what it was like?
I mean, in the world before.

301
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
Yeah.

302
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,775
Well, what was it like?

303
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,323
People had more than they needed.

304
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:20,621
We had no idea what was
precious, what wasn't.

305
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:29,338
We threw away things people
kill each other for now.

306
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,468
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,096
You have a book.

308
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,307
- Can I see it?
- No, you cannot.

309
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,601
- I just, I just wanna look at it.
- No. I said no.

310
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,312
Listen, I can't even read! Come
on, please, let me just see it.

311
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,065
What is with you? It is just a book!

312
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,901
It's not just a book.

313
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,070
- What do you mean, it's not just a book?
- Look.

314
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:57,658
No more questions about the book, all
right? No more questions. All right?

315
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,103
I got a question for you, since you're here.

316
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,939
Well, maybe I'll answer it and maybe I won't.

317
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,734
Where do you get your water?

318
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,070
Can't tell you that.

319
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,281
- You can't tell me or you don't know?
- Oh, I know.

320
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:43,162
But if you're not talking about the
book, I'm not talking about the water.

321
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,835
You're something else, you know.

322
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,629
All right, I got another question for you.

323
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,339
Right.

324
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,633
You hungry?

325
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,718
There's a lot of food there,

326
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,846
more than I can eat.

327
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,390
Tell you what.

328
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,894
We can share it, you know,
like old people used to.

329
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,023
Okay.

330
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,233
Okay?

331
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,574
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Sit.

332
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,994
Sit.

333
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,914
This'll be for you.

334
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,083
Give me your hands.

335
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,587
What are you doing?

336
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,922
Trust me. Give me your hands.

337
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,928
Close your eyes.

338
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,850
Dear Lord, we thank you for this meal.

339
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,395
We thank you for a warm bed

340
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,357
and a roof over our head on
cold nights such as this.

341
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,152
It's been too long.

342
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,070
Is this from your book?

343
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,782
Don't interrupt. Close your eyes.

344
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:08,039
We thank you for the gift of companionship

345
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,458
in hard times like these.

346
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,710
Amen.

347
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,841
Now we eat?

348
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,636
Now we eat.

349
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,168
Good morning, Solara.

350
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,673
How was your night? Did you sleep well?

351
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,424
I did like you said.

352
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,927
Of course you did what I said.

353
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,348
But did it work? Is he staying?

354
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,351
We didn't do much talking.

355
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,521
Solara, honey, eat something.

356
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,026
Mom, give me your hand.

357
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,364
Close your eyes.

358
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,533
Mom, trust me.

359
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,457
Dear Lord.

360
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,461
We thank you for our food.

361
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,756
Thank you for my mother.

362
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,429
Thank you for the roof over
our heads and our new friends.

363
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,474
And...

364
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,899
Well, I guess that's all for now.

365
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,901
Amen.

366
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,785
That's the word you're looking for. Amen.

367
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,956
That's how you stop.

368
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,174
You said you didn't talk much.

369
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,470
But did he do any reading?

370
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,433
- I asked you a question.
- Bill, don't.

371
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,102
You. Shut your mouth.

372
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,031
Stop!

373
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,784
You're hurting your mother, Solara.

374
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,913
He said he read every day. Did he?

375
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,374
Stop it!

376
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,377
Your mother would like you to tell me.

377
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,961
I don't know!

378
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,547

379
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,972
Yes, okay! Yes, yes, he was reading.

380
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,892
- What kind of book was he reading?
- I don't know!

381
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,311
- I don't know! An old leather one!
- And?

382
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,400
I don't know, it had some kind
of thing on the front of it!

383
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,736
- Show me.
- I need you to let her go!

384
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,279
Show me!

385
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,044
Redridge!

386
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,184
Shit! He was here the whole night.

387
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,686
Where is he?

388
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,689
I don't... I don't...

389
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,404
- I just wanna make sure that you know that...
- I understand.

390
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,114
...there's no acid in
there. That's swamp water.

391
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,116
It doesn't matter. Just take
these off. Take them off.

392
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,618
- All right. Well, let me, all right, just...
- Take them off.

393
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,288
- Hey!
- All right. You got it, coming off.

394
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,414
- Thank you.
- Coming off.

395
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,291
You can tell them I made
you do it, all right?

396
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,375
All right.

397
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,544
- Say it.
- You made me do it.

398
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:52,781
Is that thing loaded? I
don't think it's loaded.

399
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:54,950
One way to find out.

400
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,828
Look, I need that book.

401
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,583
I mean, I want the book and you,

402
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,921
but if you make me choose, I'll
kill you, I'll take the book.

403
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,841
Why? Why do you want it?

404
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,012
I grew up with it.

405
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,431
I know its power.

406
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,601
And if you read it, then so do you.

407
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,438
That's why they burned
them all after the war.

408
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,026
Just staying alive is an act of faith.

409
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,403
Building this town is an
even bigger act of faith,

410
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,739
but they don't understand that,

411
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,950
none of them.

412
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,955
And I don't have the right words
to help them, but the book does.

413
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,334
Now, I admit

414
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,003
that I've had to do things,

415
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,674
many, many things, that I hate,
to build this. I confess that.

416
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,719
But if we have that book,

417
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,556
I wouldn't have to.

418
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,558
Now imagine.

419
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,230
Imagine how different, how righteous
this little world could be

420
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,649
if we had the right words for our faith.

421
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,402
The people would truly understand why
they're here and what they're doing

422
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,488
and they wouldn't need any
of the uglier motivations.

423
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,870
It's not right to keep that book hidden
away. It's meant to be shared with others.

424
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,998
It's meant to be spread.

425
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,375
Isn't that what you want?

426
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,502
With all of my heart and soul.

427
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,506
I always believed that

428
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:37,678
I'd find a place where this book
belonged, where it was needed.

429
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,434
But I haven't found it yet.

430
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,774
I love this guy.

431
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,489

432
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,371
Shoot him, please.

433
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,728
What are you standing around for?

434
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,732
Take him out, God damn it! Take him out!

435
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,317
I don't like being followed.

436
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,778
I wanna come with you!

437
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,488
No, you don't.

438
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,531
I hate it here.

439
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:49,286
- Then change it.
- My mother thinks I'll be safer with you.

440
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,586
I'll take you to where we get our water.

441
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,255
You can have all that you can carry.

442
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,683
I mean, all that we can carry.

443
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,275
Carnegie knows about two
more springs up north.

444
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,819
He says he's gonna build more towns.

445
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,323
How'd he know about this one?

446
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,576
He'd been here when he was young.

447
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,497
In the world before.

448
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,042
I guess everyone else who knew about it died.

449
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,588
We really better hurry.

450
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,930
I think I left my glasses inside. Just
take a look for me. I'll look out here.

451
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,014
Okay.

452
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,398
What are you doing?

453
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,111
You are such a liar!

454
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,116
I'm not a liar.

455
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,994
You said I could come with
you if you got your water!

456
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,496
I didn't say that. You said that.

457
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,499
Besides, the road's no place for you.

458
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,252
It's much worse than you think.

459
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,714
Goodbye, Solara. It's nice
knowing you, I mean that.

460
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,966
- Hey.
- Yeah?

461
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,051
Fuck you!

462
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,569
Have you washed your filthy fucking hands?

463
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,363
Twice. With your soap.

464
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,912
Put a crew together. We're going after him.

465
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,455
For a fucking book.

466
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,041
It's not a fucking book!

467
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,668
It's a weapon!

468
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,799
A weapon aimed right at the hearts and
minds of the weak and the desperate!

469
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,218
It will give us control of them!

470
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:17,184
If we wanna rule more than one small
fucking town, we have to have it!

471
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:21,438
People will come from all over,
they'll do exactly what I tell them

472
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:25,025
if the words are from the book.

473
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:33,533
It's happened before, and it'll happen again.

474
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,494
All we need is that book.

475
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,927
Then I want Solara.

476
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:59,184
Are you bargaining with me?

477
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,271
Is this a deal we're making here?

478
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,401
We lost a lot of men.

479
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,070
You need me more than ever.

480
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:15,242
Now, you say that book's worth
the trouble. Well, I believe you,

481
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,663
but I want Solara for it.

482
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:35,303
Why not? Why not?

483
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,099
Let's get the fuck out of here.

484
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:46,940
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.
Stay on the path. It's not your concern.

485
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,093
Which way are we headed?

486
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:16,845
West.

487
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,511
Hello?

488
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,680
Can anyone help me?

489
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,476
Hello? Is anybody there?

490
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,612
Are you okay?

491
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,619
Yes. I'm fine. You go along. I'll be okay.

492
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,957
- No, no, here, let me just help you.
- No, really, please. I'm fine. Really.

493
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:31,378
I need a man to help, not
you. You just go along.

494
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,507
- It's okay, it'll just take a minute.
- No! It's fine. Please.

495
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,368
Help! Help!

496
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,001
Get off me!

497
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,092
Thank you!

498
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,673
Over there.

499
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,641
What's wrong?

500
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,185
You hear that?

501
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,813
Hear what?

502
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,361
Don't move. Don't move.

503
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,296
Here. Take the wire off of that.

504
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,423
Spool it up.

505
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,926
- What is that?
- Dinner.

506
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,282
It's like he's protected somehow,

507
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,119
like there's nothing that can touch him.

508
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,040
He's just a fucking man.

509
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,379
You put a bullet in him,
he'll go down like any other.

510
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,968
Still warm.

511
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,724
No more than a few hours dead.

512
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,021
He can't be far.

513
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,114
Son of a bitch!

514
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:13,743
Solara.

515
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,580
Are you sure you still want her?

516
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,714
It's gonna be dark soon. We can't track
them at night, they'll see us coming.

517
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,093
We could drive right past
them and never know it.

518
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,262
He's right.

519
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,598
They're on foot, tired.
They'll have to sleep.

520
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,856
We'll make up the ground tomorrow.
We'll have them before morning's out.

521
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,443
That better be a guarantee.

522
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,671
Do you really read the same book every day?

523
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,214
Without fail.

524
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,095
Will you read some to me?

525
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,016
Please?

526
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,565
"The Lord is my shepherd.

527
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,234
"I shall not want.

528
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,324
"He makes me to lie down in green pastures.

529
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,244
"Leads me beside the still waters.

530
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,039
"He restores my soul.

531
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:47,378
"He leadeth me in the path of
righteousness, for his name's sake.

532
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,928
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death

533
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:59,182
"I will fear no evil, for thou art with me."

534
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,102
- That's beautiful.
- You like that?

535
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,231
- Did you write that?
- Yes, I did.

536
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,274
Really?

537
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,985
No, no. No.

538
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,366
No, that was around a long time before
you and I got here, that's for sure.

539
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,500
What did you mean when you
said it's not just any book?

540
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,262
It's the only one.

541
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:40,807
Really?

542
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,351
After the war, people made it their business

543
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:47,230
to find and destroy any that
the fires didn't get already.

544
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:51,484
Some people said this was the reason
for the war in the first place.

545
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:55,655
Anyway, it's the only one that survived.

546
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,827
How'd you get it?

547
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,376
They said that the war

548
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,297
tore a hole in the sky, you've
probably heard the stories.

549
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,506
Yeah.

550
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,051
Tore a hole in the sky, sun came down

551
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,096
and burned everything.

552
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,557
Everything and everybody.

553
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:27,562
You were lucky to hole up and hide
in a place like this or underground.

554
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,317
Most people weren't lucky.

555
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:38,823
So, a year later, we started coming out,

556
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,575
and people wandered around.

557
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:46,539
I, not knowing what I was gonna do,
trying to find a place to survive.

558
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,543
One day, I heard a voice.

559
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,797
It's hard to explain, but it was like it...

560
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,759
Like it was coming from inside of me.

561
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,889
But I could hear it as clear as
I can hear you talking to me now.

562
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,391
What did this voice say?

563
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,268
It led me

564
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,730
to a place where I found the book

565
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,274
buried under some rubble.

566
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:21,032
The voice told me to carry the book out west.

567
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:26,162
Told me that a path would be laid out for me,

568
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,833
that I'd be led to a place
where the book was safe.

569
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,756
Told me that I'd be protected

570
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:41,344
against anyone or anything
that stood in my path.

571
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,933
I've been walking ever since.

572
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:52,271
And you did all that because a
voice in your head told you to?

573
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,440
Yes, I did.

574
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,068
I know what I heard.

575
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:59,237
I know what I hear.

576
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,572
I know I'm not crazy.

577
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,451
And I know I would've
never made it without help.

578
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:09,330
- What's that?
- One question too many.

579
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,917
Go to bed, we got an early
start in the morning.

580
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,664
Hey.

581
01:11:03,718 --> 01:11:04,802

582
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,518

583
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,939
What are you doing?

584
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,817
- I'm sorry, I thought you were sleeping.
- I wasn't sleeping.

585
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,652
What are you doing?

586
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,821
I just wanted to see the book.

587
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,866
Nobody touches it but me, you understand me?

588
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,076
Do you understand me?

589
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,871
- Yes, I understand.
- Good. Go to sleep.

590
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:44,759
You said you don't know how to
read anyway. It's no use to you.

591
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:45,927
Yeah.

592
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,387
So teach me.

593
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,785
Hold up. Hold up! Stop!

594
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,960
You know, you say you've been
walking for 30 years, right?

595
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,253
Right.

596
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,380
Have you ever thought
that maybe you were lost?

597
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,589
Nope.

598
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,008
Well, how do you know that you're
walking in the right direction?

599
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,553
"We walk by faith, not by sight."

600
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,805
What does that mean?

601
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:34,517
It means that you know something,
even if you don't know something.

602
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,685
That doesn't make any sense.

603
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,728
Doesn't have to make sense,
it's faith. It's faith.

604
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,815
It's the flower of light
in the field of darkness

605
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,359
that's giving me the strength
to carry on. You understand?

606
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,694
Is that from your book?

607
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,739
No, it's Johnny Cash live at Folsom Prison.

608
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,533
What?

609
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:16,517
- Do you think anyone lives there?
- I don't know.

610
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,979
Maybe there's water.

611
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,407
Stay behind me.

612
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:36,495

613
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,122
This is weird.

614
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,700
Who are you?

615
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:21,207
We're travelers, that's
all. Don't mean any harm.

616
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,126
No trespassing! Haven't you read the sign?

617
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,463
We're very sorry. I didn't see it.

618
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,131
What's your business?

619
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,299
- We were just...
- No business!

620
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,804
Just... We're very sorry, and if
you let us, we'll be on our way.

621
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:38,891
George, look at them. One
of them is just a girl.

622
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,895
Yeah. It's an old story, I've
heard it a hundred times before.

623
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:47,400
We get so few visitors these days.
George is suspicious of everybody.

624
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,404
I'm Martha. Would you care for some tea?

625
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,042
How about some music? It's so soothing.

626
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:06,961
George!

627
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:30,443
How do you like it? It's nice. Please.

628
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:45,124
- Is that good?
- Good, good. That's... Taste is rich.

629
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,549
It's amazing that you two have
survived out here all by yourselves.

630
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,886
Well, now, George is something of a handyman.

631
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:02,558
He did a lot of work on
this place, making it safe.

632
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,269
We may be old, but we're resilient.

633
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,939
We've known more than a few who've
tried to take this place from us.

634
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:11,192
- Haven't we, George?
- Yes, we have.

635
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,903
- Right.
- I wanna show you something. Come on.

636
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,238
George, no! Not now!

637
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,491
Come on!

638
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,370
- Are these...
- Graves? Sure.

639
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,831
Be uncivilized not to bury them.

640
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,334
Besides, it's good for the soil.

641
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,797
Come on back inside. I think I might be
able to rustle you up some sandwiches.

642
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,174
Well, thank you, thank you very much.

643
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,801
- We gotta go now.
- They killed all these people.

644
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,469
They didn't just kill them, they ate them.

645
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,472
- Her hands... Her hands were shaking.
- Too much human meat. Let's go.

646
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,850
I found some meat. I hope you're hungry.

647
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,560
Nope. No, thank you.

648
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:49,438
Well, we... We gotta be going.

649
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,732
- So soon?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

650
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,443
- Are you sure you won't stay?
- I'm sure, I'm very sure.

651
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,320
Put the gun down.

652
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,280
Solara, you take this. Open
the door for us, please.

653
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,491
- Solara, say thank you for the tea.
- Thank you for the tea.

654
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,784
Thank you so much for the tea.

655
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,293
Go back inside.

656
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,298
George, what's wrong?

657
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,801
Whole company of armed
degenerates, that's what's wrong!

658
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,427
And they led them straight to us.

659
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,848
- I just set out the good china.
- Fuck the china!

660
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,141
Have you got any more weapons?

661
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,935
Weapons? I'll show you some weapons.

662
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,691
- Can you shoot a gun?
- Of course.

663
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,861
Come on, come on!

664
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,155
We know you're in there!

665
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,867
Come on out and nobody needs to get hurt!

666
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:49,498
I'll make it easy!

667
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,585
Send out Solara with the book!

668
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,588
- What are we gonna do?
- I know what the fuck I'm doing!

669
01:17:55,671 --> 01:18:00,467
- Wait, wait, wait.
- That's all I want, the book and the girl!

670
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,138
They ain't coming out.

671
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,626
Shit! Get down! Everybody, get down!

672
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,772
Hey! You know that voice you heard?

673
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,815
Did it say anything about this?

674
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,318
We'll get out alive, both of us!

675
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:00,986
What about us?

676
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,530
Didn't mention you!

677
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,958
Cease fire!

678
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,210

679
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,889
Martha? Martha?

680
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:32,017
Martha! Martha!

681
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,274
- Martha.
- Go in on the side! Over on the side!

682
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,817
You bastards!

683
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,612
- The side of the house!
- You fucking bastards!

684
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,371
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- What are they doing?

685
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,123
Nothing good.

686
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,698
Where's the book?

687
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:18,165
Check his pack.

688
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,310
It ain't here.

689
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:45,943
This is your last chance. You give it
up or I swear I'll bury you out here.

690
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,330
Son of a bitch.

691
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,457
Let's try this again.

692
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,131
- Carnegie!
- What?

693
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,811
Now, where's the book?

694
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,068
Give him the book, please.

695
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,533
Don't tell him.

696
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,795
It's in the house, back of the TV.

697
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,591
Go check the TV!

698
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:52,509
The what?

699
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,680
You're fucking shitting me. You, go! Go!

700
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,261
Ask, and you shall receive.

701
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,644
God is good, is he not?

702
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,647
All the time.

703
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,651
Not all the time.

704
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,929
No! No!

705
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,767
You see?

706
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,688
What did I tell you?

707
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:17,321
He's just a man.

708
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,827
No! Leave him alone!

709
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,121
Please, stop!

710
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,838
Where's your protection now?

711
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,313
Pray for me.

712
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,901
Okay?

713
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,032
I mean it.

714
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,319
No!

715
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,495
Shit!

716
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,415
Go back!

717
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:19,044
Come on! Come on!

718
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,691
We barely got enough fuel to make
it back. You wanna go after her?

719
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,151
No.

720
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:50,904
- Where are you going?
- I'm going west. Gotta go west.

721
01:30:53,615 --> 01:30:54,699
Hey!

722
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,041
Here.

723
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,559
I'm sorry.

724
01:31:22,102 --> 01:31:23,561
For what?

725
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,481
- This. This is all my fault.
- No, it's not.

726
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:30,819
No, it is. If I didn't come with
you, none of this would've happened.

727
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,405
It's not your fault.

728
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,826
I did what I had to do.

729
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:41,371
I didn't think anything could
make you give up that book.

730
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,915
I thought it was too important.

731
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,588
All the years I've been carrying
it and reading it every day.

732
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,343
I got so caught up with keeping it safe,

733
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,723
I forgot to live by what I learned from it.

734
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,767
Yeah, and what's that?

735
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:04,936
Just...

736
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,401
Do for others more than you do for yourself.

737
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,322
That's what I got from it, anyway.

738
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,454
You smell that?

739
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,332
- What?
- In the air?

740
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:08,666
Salt?

741
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:15,882
We're getting close to the ocean.

742
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:16,234
That's it.

743
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:19,779

744
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,480
Get the Engineer!

745
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:28,241
That's far enough!

746
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:31,619
What's your business here?

747
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,664
My name is Eli!

748
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,418
I have a King James Bible in my possession.

749
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,003
Remain where you are!

750
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:44,173
Don't attempt to make any sudden
moves, or you will be fired upon!

751
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:04,444
Be careful with it. Be careful.

752
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:12,869
Careful with it.

753
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,464
They're clean.

754
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,593
We've been doing this for a long time now.

755
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,098
- Feels like a museum.
- No, it's much more than that.

756
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,352
This is where we're going to start again.

757
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:41,856
We've got a printing press.
It'll be operational quite soon.

758
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:45,360
We're going to teach people
about the world they lost.

759
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,653
Help them start to rebuild it.

760
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:52,158
I mean, look. Shakespeare. Britannica,
missing only a few volumes.

761
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:56,162
There's a whole series of
beautiful Mozart and Wagner records

762
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,498
in still very pristine condition.

763
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:01,292
But never a Bible. Well, not until now.

764
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:05,129
Well, may I ask what condition it's in?

765
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:08,299
It's beat up,

766
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:11,135
but it will do the job.

767
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,889
- Do you think I could see it?
- Yes, you may.

768
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,149
- That's it. It's open.
- You there?

769
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,310
Do you have anything to write on?

770
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:04,355
Could you get us some writing paper, please?

771
01:39:05,022 --> 01:39:06,607
And a lot of it.

772
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:09,819
A whole lot of it.

773
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,238
It can't be.

774
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:14,866
It...

775
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:21,581
It's impossible!

776
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:24,709
It can't be!

777
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:31,382
Pay close attention and write down

778
01:39:33,176 --> 01:39:34,886
everything I say

779
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:39,015
exactly as I say it.

780
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:45,771
"The first book of Moses.

781
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,526

"And there was light."

798
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:24,996
Where is Solara?

799
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,042
Out there.

800
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:32,503
Her choice.

801
01:41:33,629 --> 01:41:37,425
I tried to bring her back. She refused.

802
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,098
What did you do when she refused?

803
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:52,606
- Read it.
- What did you do to my daughter?

804
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:55,901
- Read it!
- What did you do to my daughter?

805
01:42:14,045 --> 01:42:16,088
You can start anytime.

806
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:25,931
I'm sorry.

807
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:31,228
It's been so long, I don't remember.

808
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:41,572
- You have to.
- I have to? Really?

809
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:44,241
No, no, no, no. You have to. Please.

810
01:42:47,912 --> 01:42:49,163
Your leg.

811
01:42:50,539 --> 01:42:52,500
It doesn't hurt anymore.

812
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,753
I can smell it.

813
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,020
You worked so hard for that book.

814
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:17,274
You sacrificed so much, so many men.

815
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,779
More than you could spare.

816
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:27,785
Now all those people who were
too scared to even say your name,

817
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,123
they're downstairs, tearing up the
bar right now. Did you know that?

818
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:35,334
And there's no one there to stop them.

819
01:43:36,669 --> 01:43:38,462
And you're feverish.

820
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:44,885
I can't imagine what it must feel
like to have what you want so close

821
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:48,639
- and it might as well be a million miles away.
- Stop it!

822
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,936
Are you leaving me?

823
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:57,857
Claudia?

824
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:01,694

825
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,532
Claudia!

826
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,144
Get away! Get away!

827
01:44:35,227 --> 01:44:36,228
It's mine!

828
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,767
Dear Lord,

829
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:59,937
thank you for giving me the
strength and the conviction

830
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,815
to complete the task you entrusted to me.

831
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:26,589

832
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:33,387
Thank you for guiding me, straight and
true, through the many obstacles in my path,

833
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,059

834
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,688
and for keeping me resolute
when all around seemed lost.

835
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:47,818
Thank you for your protection and
for your many signs along the way.

836
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:53,908
Thank you for any good that I may have
done. I'm so sorry about the bad.

837
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:59,246
You don't have to leave, you know.
You're very welcome to stay here.

838
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,458
- You'll be perfectly safe.
- Thank you,

839
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:06,503
but this is something that I have to do.

840
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:12,843
Where will you go?

841
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:15,220
Home.

842
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:23,729
Thank you for the friend I made.

843
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:27,107
Please watch over her as
you've watched over me.

844
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:51,382
Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.

845
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,801
I'm so very tired,

846
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,262
but I go now to my rest, at peace,

847
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:02,017
knowing that I have done right
with my time on this earth.

848
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:07,856

849
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:12,987
I fought the good fight.

850
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:15,572
I finished the race.

851
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,661
I kept the faith.
