1
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,298
Brrr.

2
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:56,304
Ah, hello dear!

3
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,599
Oh it's a nasty night isn't it?

4
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:01,935
Here.

5
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,772
Here, you are, go
and get yourself a little nip.

6
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:07,941
Thank you Miss, thank you.

7
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,443
Same to you, really!

8
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:13,381
Mary Clark.

9
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,916
Yes Mary we know all about that.

10
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,488
But I still want to know why you

11
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,543
hit him with the bottle?

12
00:04:14,794 --> 00:04:17,755
Like I said, he insulted me!

13
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,508
Come Nelly you've been insulted before.

14
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,386
That's hardly the point officer.

15
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,389
Anyway he wouldn't pay me what he owed me!

16
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,742
Ah that's better, now we're
getting nearer the facts.

17
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,018
He insulted me.

18
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,372
- Oh good evening sir!
- Is Inspector O'Neill in?

19
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,857
Yes sir, should I tell him you're...

20
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:37,484
Ooh, a Mr. Tuff.

21
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,361
That Nelly was the
Assistant Commissioner

22
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,281
from Scotland Yard, not that
it's any of your business!

23
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,450
It's his if he's come to put a rocket

24
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,869
under you fat backside!

25
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,748
Another of them Ripper jobs last night!

26
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,375
Or haven't you read about it?

27
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,669
You've had all the extra
men you've asked for!

28
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:59,172
The rest of London is
practically naked of policemen,

29
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:01,341
and still you're no nearer
to making an arrest!

30
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,801
I've made plenty of
arrests here, dozens of them.

31
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:06,012
Every lunatic and
sensation seeker in London

32
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:07,904
has given himself up as Jack the Ripper.

33
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:10,558
Stop using that stupid name!

34
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,559
I didn't Christen him sir,

35
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,104
but the one who did knew
what he was talking about.

36
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,916
Have you ever seen any of his victims?

37
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,858
No, a body's a body isn't it?

38
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,861
What's the point of
romanticizing these crimes?

39
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:23,506
Do you know that they've asked another

40
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,548
question in the house today?

41
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:25,758
- So I heard.
- Home secretary's

42
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:26,991
practically out of his mind!

43
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:28,923
"What's been done," they keep asking him!

44
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:30,245
He's run out of replies!

45
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,417
- He has my deepest sympathy.
- There's no cause

46
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:33,748
to be flippant O'Neill!

47
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,184
I am not being flippant sir,

48
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,919
and I'm going to tell you something else.

49
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,421
Do you know how long it
is since I've been home?

50
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:41,756
Four days.

51
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:44,425
Do you know how much sleep
I've had in the past 48 hours?

52
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,970
Six hours, all here on this chair!

53
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:48,864
I've got every man working in this station

54
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,307
every hour God created, most
of them are ready to drop

55
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,852
but they go on just like I
do because it's their job!

56
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:56,904
Despite the fact that
every ignorant layabout

57
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,707
from here to Westminster and back thinks

58
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:02,151
they're lazy and incompetent
and they ought to be dismissed!

59
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:04,046
You must pardon me if
I don't feel sympathy

60
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,422
for the home secretary just because

61
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,115
he's embarrassed in the house!

62
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:08,616
Yes.

63
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:09,951
Yes, of course.

64
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,288
Well, what's the next move?

65
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,266
Every line of investigation
will be followed

66
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,330
to its logical conclusion.

67
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,601
That's what you said last time.

68
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,794
And I shall very likely
way it next time too.

69
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,338
Come in!

70
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,630
What is it?
- Sorry sir,

71
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,192
but that's a man in the
bar at The Red Goose

72
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,634
asking questions about the Ripper.

73
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:30,638
The governor thinks the crowd
might start getting ideas.

74
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,991
The crowd at the Red Goose always

75
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,891
have ideas of some sort or another.

76
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,202
Well I suppose I better go down and see

77
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,270
what it's all about, all right Sergeant.

78
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,355
You'll excuse me sir.

79
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:41,327
But remember inspector, the police force

80
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,401
are in particularly bad
order at the moment.

81
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,653
We're all relying on you
to do something about it.

82
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,006
I shall continue to do my best sir.

83
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,591
I'm sure you will,
there's a good fellow!

84
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:49,657
No off you go.

85
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,036
This man might be the Ripper himself, eh?

86
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,204
He might sir, he might.

87
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,082
We know what you're about mister!

88
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,054
Don't give us that stuff!
- All I asked was

89
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,769
if anyone had actually seen the Ripper.

90
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,880
We heard what you said, we're not deaf.

91
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,052
We want to know why you
asked it, that's what.

92
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,193
- I'm interested, that's why.
- We know you're interested,

93
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,094
mister, how interested?

94
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,447
- Oh I'm sorry...
- It wouldn't be that

95
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,222
you're interested to see if anyone's seen

96
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:14,514
your face, are you?

97
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,018
Now you don't think that...

98
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,103
Come now gentlemen, I just arrived

99
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,980
from America this morning.

100
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,357
That's what you say.

101
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,691
Can you prove it?

102
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:25,263
Why should I have to prove it?

103
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:27,695
- Let's give it to him.
- Hold on a minute boys,

104
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,322
this gent ain't done no harm!

105
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:30,948
You keep out of this!

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,868
Well come on what you waiting for?

107
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:49,592
Well come on, they said

108
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:51,386
the Ripper was a foreigner!

109
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,688
Now Mr. Jack the Ripper,

110
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,648
what have you got to say for yourself?

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,984
We'll soon make him talk won't we boys?

112
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,787
All right my friend, let's see how

113
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,997
you like your belly slit open!

114
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,710
Stop that!

115
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:27,880
Let him go Charlie!

116
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:28,798
You too Tom!

117
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,674
Well he's been asking all sorts of

118
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,343
questions Mr. O'Neill,
questions about the Ripper!

119
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,697
Since when did you take
the law into your own hands?

120
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,401
With all due respect to you Mr. O'Neill,

121
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,991
but the police haven't
been much help have they?

122
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,183
That's still no excuse!

123
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,075
Now get out of here all of you, come on,

124
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:42,520
take him with you!

125
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,812
Come on, move!

126
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,609
Your listening to him
makes you a bad as he is!

127
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:50,945
Now get a move on.

128
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,780
Come on, hurry it up!

129
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,993
Nice piece of work mister,

130
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,619
the way you handled 'em I mean.

131
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,289
Nasty rough men they are.

132
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,750
There, that's right, better now sir?

133
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,251
Yes, thank you.

134
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,089
Give it back Snaky.

135
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,633
- Give what back?
- He's a friend of mine.

136
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,525
Oh on my life Mr. O'Neill I never knew

137
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,597
he was a mate of yours...
- Give it back!

138
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,352
Here you are governor.

139
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,247
I never knew you was a
mate of Mr. O'Neill's,

140
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:26,271
I swear I never.

141
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,982
I, I wouldn't have done it.

142
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:46,042
- Oh!
- Drink?

143
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,710
- Whisky.
- Two whiskies please.

144
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:49,253
- Well?
- Well what?

145
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,756
It never quits, I visit
America, you drag me out of

146
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,692
a fight in New York,
you've come to London,

147
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,156
and favor returned.
- All part of the

148
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,278
metropolitan police service?

149
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:57,571
- When did you arrive?
- This morning.

150
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,138
Well why didn't you come and see me?

151
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,931
I thought I'd have a look around at

152
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:02,117
the scene of the crime,
get a little local color.

153
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,976
You nearly became
part of the local color!

154
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:05,603
Bright red.
- Thanks.

155
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:07,615
Oh and uh, thanks for
your help, young lady.

156
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,898
Oh that's all right sir.

157
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,417
Hello Helen, how's your mother?

158
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,241
Oh she's much better
thank you, Mr. O'Neill.

159
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,276
Good

160
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:15,695
Nice kid.

161
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:18,783
You know I'm almost glad I came.

162
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,244
You'll excuse me asking,
but why did you come?

163
00:10:21,536 --> 00:10:23,162
Your letter just said you were writing.

164
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:25,057
Believe it or not the
New York Police Department

165
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,582
have given me a vacation.

166
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:28,754
Oh you've chose a good
time to come to London.

167
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,877
So it seems.

168
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:31,212
You want any help?

169
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:32,922
What about your vacation?

170
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,757
Well, a change is as good as a rest.

171
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,729
Anyway in New York we don't have a Ripper.

172
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,344
Are you serious?

173
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,305
Yeah, do you mind if I tag along?

174
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,117
By all means, you can't do any harm.

175
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:45,393
Why that settles that.

176
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:46,685
Where do we start?

177
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:47,955
First I suggest you come home and have

178
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:49,480
some supper with me.

179
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:52,376
After supper you can go
around to the station,

180
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,026
start reading up what we know to date.

181
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:58,281
Get some of that local color
you were talking about.

182
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,761
Since when can a
policeman afford to travel

183
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,043
3000 miles on a vacation?

184
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,753
Something I didn't tell you Ned.

185
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:13,671
The department are paying.

186
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:15,083
- Oh.
- They're interested in

187
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:16,976
this Ripper business
in so far as it effects

188
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,926
the local populace, general reactions,

189
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,762
attitude towards the police,
mob violence, stuff like that.

190
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,265
Well see for yourself,
look up the street.

191
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,951
Before this Ripper business started you

192
00:11:25,975 --> 00:11:27,393
could hardly move along here.

193
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:30,021
Stalls, barrel organs, people
spilling out of the pubs,

194
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:31,814
it was a happy place.

195
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,400
Not particularly moral but happy.

196
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,694
Take these men that attacked you in there.

197
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:38,922
One of 'em is a blacksmith,
another a shop assistant,

198
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:40,156
I know them well.

199
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,032
Apart from the one with the knife

200
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:42,909
they're just ordinary people.

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,887
Yeah, they didn't seem much
like ordinary people to me!

202
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,305
That's what the Ripper has done to them.

203
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,207
- Now you mean to tell me...
- And no jokes, please!

204
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,126
You'll learn, come on.

205
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:57,715
Leave me alone,

206
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:01,135
leave me alone!

207
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,888
The next time you come
in here and can't pay,

208
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,182
I'll have you fixed proper!

209
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:10,478
Ah none of that, none
of that, off with you.

210
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,398
Hey, you!

211
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,690
You're late.

212
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:17,818
I'm sorry sir, I lost my way.

213
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,946
First day, late.

214
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:23,282
I don't know what some of you
girls think this place is!

215
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,867
Go on, get inside!

216
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,413
Good evening Mr. O'Neill, and you too sir!

217
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,183
- Who was that?
- Just a drunkard sir,

218
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:31,749
we get 'em all the time.

219
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,460
- The girl, the girl!
- Oh, the girl,

220
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,754
oh oh, she's new, started today.

221
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,565
Just make sure nothing happens to her

222
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:39,909
like happened to the Turner girl.

223
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,134
Look Mr. O'Neill, I
should be responsible

224
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,595
for what happens to my
employees in their spare time?

225
00:12:44,887 --> 00:12:46,323
It's no good pleading innocence with me

226
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:47,556
about the Turner girl.

227
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,267
She came to me the day before
she jumped into the river.

228
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,162
I told her to go back to
her family in the country,

229
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:54,772
but she thought she knew better.

230
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,857
I'm gonna keep an eye on this new girl,

231
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,460
so help me if anything happens to her

232
00:12:58,484 --> 00:12:59,962
I'll come back here
and break every bottle,

233
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:03,364
glass mirror and chair
over your filthy head!

234
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:07,368
Come on Sam.

235
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Thank you Miss.

236
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,452
Good night.
- Good evening Hodges.

237
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:23,175
Good evening Miss.

238
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,653
Do you know where my guardian is?

239
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:25,904
Well Dr. Chambers is
supposed to be operating

240
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,389
about now Miss, would you like
me to tell him you're here?

241
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,683
Oh don't bother, I don't
want to interrupt him.

242
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,494
I'll wait for him in the almoner's office.

243
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,813
Very well Miss, if I see
him I'll tell him you're here.

244
00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:37,857
Hodges have you seen Dr. Tranter?

245
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:38,816
Good evening Dr. Urquhart!

246
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:40,588
I thought he was operating right now?

247
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,016
Well he's supposed to be but
we can't find him anywhere.

248
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,673
Perhaps he went on an outside case?

249
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:45,882
Must be a very important
one to take him away

250
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,742
when he should be in the theater.

251
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,834
What are you doing here?
- I came to meet him.

252
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,537
And I want to see Mrs. Bolton.

253
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:53,622
Maybe I'll see you later.

254
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:55,594
Well, if you find him, will you tell him

255
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,185
I'm waiting in the almoner's office?

256
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,209
Of course.

257
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,233
Hello my dear, you shouldn't
be about as late as this!

258
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,778
Nonsense Mrs. Bolton.

259
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,213
If I'm to take over your duties

260
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,437
I shall be a great deal later.

261
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,699
If you take over my duties.

262
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,911
I still don't think Dr.
Tranter will allow it.

263
00:14:32,203 --> 00:14:34,371
I'm of age now, I can
make up my own mind.

264
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:37,458
Indeed you can my dear, indeed you can!

265
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,376
How about a nice cup of tea?

266
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:41,212
Thank you.

267
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,255
- May I go Master?
- Yes.

268
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:44,691
You'll be all right
walking home by yourself?

269
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,300
Oh of course, it's only a little way!

270
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:48,153
All right dear,
goodnight, see you tomorrow!

271
00:14:48,177 --> 00:14:49,303
Goodnight sir!

272
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:10,031
It's you!

273
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,116
What do you want?

274
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,761
You hit me on the head
with a bottle tonight!

275
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:14,545
Well it was no more
than what you deserved!

276
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:16,598
Now get out of me way or
I'll call the governor,

277
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:18,165
he's in the bar room!

278
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,828
Mary Clark.

279
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,955
Mary Clark.

280
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:00,958
No that's not me name, I'm sorry.

281
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:05,004
Where can if find her?

282
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,389
Any sign of Dr. Tranter yet?

283
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:07,523
No sir.

284
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:16,116
Cover those instruments
in front of a patient.

285
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,793
Nothing to be frightened of Kitty.

286
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,485
Dr. Tranter is a very good surgeon.

287
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:31,674
You won't feel a thing.

288
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:34,510
Sorry I'm late.

289
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,428
Outside case.

290
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,681
All ready here?
- Yes sir.

291
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,266
Let me see that.

292
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:45,980
Knowles isn't it?
- Yes sir.

293
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,732
Right now let's see what
we can do for you, shall we?

294
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,192
Thank you nurse.

295
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,863
Now breathe deeply, deeply.

296
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:06,000
That's right, breathe deeply.

297
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,585
Now don't fight, relax, relax.

298
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,547
That's right, now breathe deeply.

299
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,132
Now count with me.

300
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:14,758
One.
- One.

301
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,050
- Two.
- Two.

302
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,637
- Three.
- Three.

303
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:20,472
- Four.
- Four.

304
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:21,974
- Five.
- Five...

305
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,559
Six.

306
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:28,272
Six.

307
00:18:36,864 --> 00:18:37,864
Scalpel.

308
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,125
Cut deeply John, that's the
secret of surgery these days.

309
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,417
Cut deeply.

310
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:55,382
♪ When underneath

311
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:59,303
♪ Isn't it a pity that the likes of her

312
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,595
Eh...

313
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:05,642
Hello, what have we got here then?

314
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,271
You'll catch cold
sleeping out here old boy.

315
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:12,941
Oh, or is it old girl?

316
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:15,944
Yes it is a girly.

317
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,740
Not old girl neither.

318
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:23,994
Hey daxxy, what you doing
sleeping in the?

319
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:26,372
Now why don't you go home eh?

320
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:29,708
Easing the load on her,

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,668
I'll give you a hand, eh!

322
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Oh!

323
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:39,927
My god, the
Ripper, he's done her in!

324
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:43,097
The Ripper, he's done another of 'em!

325
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:46,100
Help, help, the Ripper!

326
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:50,896
He's done it again,
help, help please help!

327
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,316
He's done it again!

328
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:55,752
- Well shut the window!
- Help!

329
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,087
How many times do I have to
repeat I must have the windows

330
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:57,653
- Help!
- Shut when I'm operating?

331
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:58,945
The Ripper!

332
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:00,715
- Shut it this instant!
- He's done it again!

333
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,408
Help, help, men, help!

334
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,417
Ghost,

335
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
ain't she?

336
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,216
It was me what found her!

337
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:20,868
- Was it?
- Yes, just laying there!

338
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,428
I thought she was sleeping!

339
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,264
Run along now you!

340
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:28,475
Bloody marvelous, I was
right half an hour after.

341
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:29,893
It's crazy!

342
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,665
Yeah, why don't we have protection?

343
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:34,314
There's Mr. O'Neill now.

344
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:38,803
What'll you do about that O'Neill?

345
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:40,696
Keep back!

346
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,701
Always like this?

347
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:46,993
Always.

348
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,583
Do you know her?
- And very much sir.

349
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,335
The barmaid at the Red Goose.

350
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,027
- Poor kid.
- They're all poor kids.

351
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,369
What's the verdict Inspector,

352
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,966
natural causes?

353
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,136
Pity Jack didn't rip
off a copper, eh O'Neill?

354
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,846
You call the wagon?

355
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,973
Hey, you
can't come through here.

356
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:10,851
That's all right constable.

357
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:12,143
Evening Sir David.

358
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:13,496
O'Neill have you no control over

359
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,771
these kind of jobs?

360
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,031
Mutilation.

361
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,949
Admirable diagnosis.

362
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,329
And who might this be?

363
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:32,331
Uh, Mr. Lowry sir, he's from America.

364
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,743
That would account for it.

365
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:34,541
Have the body taken to the hospital,

366
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,153
I'll do a post mortem right away.

367
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:37,653
I've already sent for the wagon.

368
00:21:37,711 --> 00:21:39,689
Heavens man, let's get this
thing out of the gutters!

369
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,353
Carry her, it's only a few hundred yards,

370
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,174
and be quick about it!

371
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,301
- That told 'em!
- It's about time somebody

372
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:46,220
started giving a few orders around here!

373
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:49,306
Go home, break
it up, break it up!

374
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:51,118
Who was the distinguished gentleman?

375
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,851
Sir David Rogers, Governor of the

376
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:55,604
Mercy Hospital for Women,
it's just around the corner.

377
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:57,022
Sociable is he?

378
00:21:57,314 --> 00:22:00,609
He's all right, his bark
is worse than his bite.

379
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,654
He's performed the majority of
post mortems on these girls.

380
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:05,948
It's easy to understand
why he's short tempered.

381
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,823
I'll get Sir David to look at her

382
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:09,034
next time he comes in,
she'll be all right.

383
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,086
Oh incidentally, Anne
called for you earlier.

384
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,968
She's downstairs in the almoner's office.

385
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:14,247
Huh.

386
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,500
Oh Louis,

387
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,512
if you're taking those
things away to clean,

388
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:21,463
clean and hone this for me will you?

389
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,882
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

390
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:26,301
A boil lancing, rather nasty.

391
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:27,177
- With that?
- It was the only one

392
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:28,595
I had with me.

393
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:29,989
A little like cutting a fingernail with

394
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:31,765
a pair of garden shears.

395
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:35,602
These are the patient's records.

396
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,974
We keep them for a year,
then if they haven't been...

397
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,166
Ah Mrs. Bolton, there's a
body coming into the morgue.

398
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,126
I'm going to do a post mortem,
let them know will you?

399
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,277
Yes Sir David.

400
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:47,906
Well good evening, who are you?

401
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,658
Anne Ford, sir.

402
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,135
I'm doctor...
- Of course, you're

403
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,286
Tranter's ward, aren't you?

404
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:53,662
How silly of me.

405
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,914
Well what you doing messing
about with this stuff?

406
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:58,625
Well Mrs. Bolton's going
on holiday shortly sir,

407
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:00,395
and I'm taking over her duties as Almoner

408
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:01,753
while she's away.
- That's right,

409
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:02,754
I'd forgotten.

410
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,965
Admirable, admirable.

411
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:07,337
Evening Tranter, I've just
been talking to your ward.

412
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,595
Delighted she's going
to be the new almoner.

413
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:13,140
Pretty face is just what this place needs.

414
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:17,579
I was going to tell you as soon as

415
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:18,603
everything was arranged.

416
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:22,024
We'll talk about that later, come along.

417
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:27,694
Sir David's here sir, he
wants you in the morgue.

418
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:29,990
- What on earth for?
- They're bringing in a body.

419
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:31,783
- What sort of body?
- A dead one.

420
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,511
I know that, but why should Sir David

421
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:34,745
want to see it tonight?

422
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:37,205
It's a Ripper job sir.

423
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,497
Oh, I see.

424
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,503
Oh, Sir David's doing a post mortem.

425
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:44,795
So I understand.

426
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,774
Come along my dear.
- Here they come now sir!

427
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,118
Well open them up, I want to
get away before they arrive.

428
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,486
Well, do you think that very wise sir?

429
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,738
I mean, they get a little nasty

430
00:23:51,762 --> 00:23:53,082
when something like this happens.

431
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,474
I'm perfectly capable of
looking after myself Urquhart.

432
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,225
I wish you goodnight.

433
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,519
Goodnight sir.

434
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:03,857
- Good evening Dr. Tranter.
- Oh good evening Inspector.

435
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:07,361
Who is it this time, another
little drab from the streets?

436
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,505
Even if it was, what
difference would it make?

437
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:10,529
Ah the police force

438
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,407
are recruiting colonials now Inspector?

439
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:14,242
Ah, this is Mr. Lowry sir.

440
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:15,869
Sam, Dr. Tranter.

441
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,245
Mr. Lowry's an American.

442
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,164
I fail to see the distinction.

443
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,333
We had a war a way back, remember?

444
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,627
A revolution Mr. Lowry, not a war.

445
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,799
Now if you'll excuse me please?

446
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,164
You're not going to try and
get through that crowd sir?

447
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:44,588
- Well of course I am.
- I wouldn't,

448
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:47,234
especially with the young lady.

449
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:48,526
Come along.

450
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:00,497
Get out of the way.

451
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:04,084
You heard what I said, get out of the way!

452
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,736
I'll teach you to respect betters!

453
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:12,384
Let's get him out of there!

454
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:22,018
Grab the girl Sam!

455
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,159
Thank you mister...

456
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,036
Lowry, Sam Lowry.

457
00:25:40,328 --> 00:25:42,289
I'm indebted, Anne Ford.

458
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:43,915
Pleased to meet you.

459
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,542
I'm most grateful to you sir.

460
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,594
Come along my dear,
we'll go out by the back.

461
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,444
Sir David is doing the post mortem,

462
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:57,429
we'd like to be present,
is that all right?

463
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:01,016
Of course you can, will
you come this way please?

464
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:02,517
Hey Ned!

465
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,730
We're gonna fix you!

466
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:10,817
Don't worry, they'll
quiet them down, come on.

467
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,865
There he is!

468
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:21,703
He's the Ripper!

469
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,676
I'll smack you!

470
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,509
I'm sorry Anne, but you saw
what happened here tonight.

471
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,607
That sort of job's not for you.

472
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:51,441
Don't you understand,

473
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,276
this is the sort of work I want to do!

474
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,111
It's no place for a woman.

475
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:57,113
Mrs. Bolton's a woman.

476
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:58,907
Mrs. Bolton's different.

477
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,868
She's only different
because she's not your ward.

478
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,330
I'm of age now, I feel I have
certain responsibilities.

479
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:06,641
The emancipation of womanhood

480
00:27:06,665 --> 00:27:08,124
that I've heard so much about.

481
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,710
So you've been bitten by this disease too.

482
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:12,295
Call it what you like,

483
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:15,841
but this is the work I want to do.

484
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,051
I'd sooner have done
it with your blessing.

485
00:27:18,343 --> 00:27:20,804
I've always tried to act in
the best way possible for you.

486
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:22,416
But as you've said, you've of age

487
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,683
and a determined young woman.

488
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:28,562
Go ahead Anne, take the job,
do the work if it pleases you.

489
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:30,730
But not with my blessing.

490
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:37,153
Well so much for that.

491
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:39,948
Get rid of those Urquhart.
- Yes sir.

492
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,782
You interested in the findings

493
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:42,284
of the post mortem, gentlemen?

494
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:43,976
No, not unless they're different.

495
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:45,829
They're not, bruises on the neck,

496
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:48,081
deep seated multiple abdominal incisions,

497
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:49,851
and as before inflicted by someone who

498
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,376
knew what he was doing.

499
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:52,854
Excuse me Sir David, how do you mean,

500
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,129
knew what he was doing?

501
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,506
Hasn't the inspector told you young man?

502
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,384
These wounds are not the
savage slashings of a maniac,

503
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:01,596
they're careful, well
defined abdominal incisions

504
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,431
that show a good knowledge
of anatomy and surgery.

505
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:06,892
- You mean a doctor?
- Doctor, nurse, student,

506
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:09,686
any one of a number of professions.

507
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,865
What's the trouble Louis?

508
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:08,036
All right Louis I'll look after her now.

509
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:13,792
Under the circumstances,

510
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:16,086
there is no verdict I can give other than

511
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:19,422
murder by a person, or persons unknown.

512
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:23,885
However, before I adjourn this court,

513
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,177
I would like to say this.

514
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:27,764
And it is not my opinion alone.

515
00:29:28,056 --> 00:29:29,856
Public confidence in the
police has never been

516
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:32,143
as low as it is today!

517
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,396
In their complete inability to apprehend

518
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:38,358
the perpetrator of these ghastly crimes,

519
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,652
they are showing themselves
to be incompetent,

520
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:42,570
inadequate, and inept!

521
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,242
Court is adjourned!

522
00:29:48,326 --> 00:29:50,412
Incompetent, inadequate and inept.

523
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:52,122
Oh the papers are gonna love this!

524
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:54,058
- Shoeshine miser, shoeshine?
- No sonny, go away!

525
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,393
What do you think about
the coroners report?

526
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,936
- What about a statement sir?
- Gentlemen you heard

527
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,320
what the coroner said, didn't you?

528
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:08,555
Anne.

529
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:10,432
- Oh Mr. Lowry.
- Miss Ford.

530
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:11,724
How nice.

531
00:30:11,975 --> 00:30:13,095
May I share your carriage?

532
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:15,645
Certainly, when I get one.

533
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:18,398
Maybe we'll stand a better
chance up the street a little.

534
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,858
All right then.

535
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,653
You've uh, been to the inquest?

536
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:25,065
Of course, why do you ask?

537
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:27,490
I thought, uh, oh it doesn't matter.

538
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,010
You thought what does a girl like me

539
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,286
doing being interested in such things.

540
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:33,830
You're as bad as my uncle.

541
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:36,362
It's a social problem as well
as a criminal one you know.

542
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,917
- Oh how come?
- It's a matter of

543
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:39,419
class difference.

544
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,756
If it happened to some
old duchess in Mayfair,

545
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:43,673
there'd be such an outcry something

546
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:47,010
would have to be done
about it, and done quickly.

547
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,404
Because these are poor people,

548
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,388
and not particularly respectable,

549
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,265
the general reaction from the...

550
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:53,757
The right side of the fence?

551
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,101
That's it.

552
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:56,662
General reaction is they're probably

553
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:58,563
not getting much more than they deserve.

554
00:30:58,855 --> 00:30:59,898
Oh yes ma'am.

555
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,108
You're making fun of me.

556
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,902
Believe me I'm not.

557
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:11,493
And how are your
investigations going Mr. Lowry?

558
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,145
Has the well trained American mind

559
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:15,622
brought new light to bear on the subject?

560
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:17,665
Now you're making fun of me.

561
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:19,643
Seriously though the most
difficult thing I've found

562
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:21,711
is getting to know the
people and the place.

563
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,797
London isn't just one city, a hundred,

564
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:25,799
and each section is completely different.

565
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:29,511
What I need is a competent
guide to show me around.

566
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,679
One who knows both sides of the tracks,

567
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:33,098
and is accepted.

568
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:35,183
You think this may help?

569
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:37,310
Oh indeed I do.

570
00:31:37,602 --> 00:31:41,022
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone, would you?

571
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:44,067
Well I suppose I could...

572
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,319
I'll take you around Mr.
Lowry, how would that be?

573
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,403
That would be just fine.

574
00:31:47,695 --> 00:31:48,964
When can we start?
- When would you

575
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,199
like to start?
- This evening.

576
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:53,743
Come for me at my house at eight.

577
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:55,245
27 Brooklyn Square.

578
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:56,788
That'll be just fine.

579
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,120
Are you just going to sit,

580
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,375
or are you going somewhere?

581
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:04,420
No, I'm not going anywhere.

582
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:05,964
How 'bout you?

583
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,067
Oh, will you ask him to
take me to the hospital?

584
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:11,636
Certainly, oh and, thanks
for the ride Miss Ford.

585
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:13,263
Until this evening.

586
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,101
Mercy Hospital for Women,
Whitechapel please.

587
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:19,602
Mr. Lowry?

588
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,163
I would have been extremely disappointed

589
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:22,867
if you hadn't managed
to fabricate a reason

590
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:25,024
for wanting to see me again.

591
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:33,950
Tell him I'll be right down

592
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:36,327
will you?
- Tell who?

593
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,079
Oh Uncle.

594
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:40,171
I thought it was Perkins
announcing my escort.

595
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:41,815
Who's the lucky man this evening?

596
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,918
That American policeman, Mr. Lowry.

597
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,290
Remember we met him that
awful night at the hospital?

598
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:47,589
You're going out with him?

599
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,466
- Yes.
- I wish you wouldn't.

600
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,927
- Why on earth not?
- But he seems so,

601
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:54,345
so brash.

602
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,806
Uncle, just because he has an accent and

603
00:32:57,098 --> 00:32:58,701
didn't go to Eaton?
- I still wish you wouldn't

604
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:00,351
go out with him.

605
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:01,996
I'm perfectly capable of taking care

606
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,689
of myself you know.
- Yes I know that but it's,

607
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,083
it's just the idea I don't like

608
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,751
the idea of you going
about with a policeman.

609
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:09,527
What is it?

610
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,446
There's a Mr. Lowry downstairs Miss.

611
00:33:11,738 --> 00:33:13,573
Oh tell him
I'll be down in a moment.

612
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:14,908
Where is he taking you?

613
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,327
To where, to a concert.

614
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:19,495
Chamber music, very dull.

615
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:22,916
Goodnight darling.

616
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,208
Goodnight.

617
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:52,070
Waiter, waiter!

618
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:53,362
Table please!

619
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:09,337
Ah, Mr.!

620
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,214
Good of you sir, good evening!

621
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:18,304
Oh no, no, this will do just fine.

622
00:34:18,596 --> 00:34:19,596
- Waiter!
- Yes sir?

623
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:20,764
Champagne!

624
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:27,814
Well, side of
the tracks you finally see.

625
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:31,753
Do you see something?

626
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:33,254
That lean girl.

627
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:36,841
The one on the end.

628
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:44,390
O'Neill warned.

629
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,225
Glad somebody does.

630
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,799
See we're not the only ones that

631
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:52,357
crossed the tracks this way.

632
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,900
Good evening My Lord!

633
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:19,592
Wait a minute, who's that?

634
00:36:19,884 --> 00:36:21,386
That one on the end?

635
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:30,978
Send her up.

636
00:36:58,423 --> 00:36:59,590
Say, you two!

637
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:01,717
Upstairs, 10 minutes.

638
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:03,009
All right who is it?

639
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:04,614
Sopwith, he's got a friend with him.

640
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:05,804
Show her what to do.

641
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:07,432
- Oh not her!
- Why not?

642
00:37:07,723 --> 00:37:08,923
She's only been here a week!

643
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:11,394
Well it's time she
started earning her living!

644
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:13,205
You don't mind having a
drink with a couple of

645
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,981
special customers do you my dear?

646
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:18,609
- I don't think so.
- No of course not!

647
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:20,778
10 minutes.
- Come on luv.

648
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:27,493
Yeah come on, you're on!

649
00:37:55,354 --> 00:37:59,317
♪ And I'll not ask for wine

650
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,044
It can't be long now old boy.

651
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:19,962
Just give them time to change,

652
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:22,882
into something appropriate.

653
00:38:26,928 --> 00:38:28,763
- Got any gin luv?
- Why?

654
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:31,098
To paint my toenails
with, what do you think?

655
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,390
- Yes I have.
- Well?

656
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:34,598
I'm gonna keep it, you
don't know what it cost me.

657
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:37,188
I've a very good idea darling.

658
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,640
What have you got over there?

659
00:38:38,689 --> 00:38:40,329
- Mentholated spirits.
- Oh you are a mean

660
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,651

661
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:44,529
Why don't you buy some of your own?

662
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,156
Watch out Maggie she's after you booze.

663
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:49,248
- Am I all right?

- There we are.
- My my, don't we look lovely.

666
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:55,373
Now if they make a joke laugh,

667
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:56,945
even if you don't understand it.

668
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,252
Keep smiling like you're
having a wonderful time.

669
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:01,879
I can't imagine why a
lord should want to meet me.

670
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:04,091
I don't know what to say!
- You don't have to say

671
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:05,925
anything deary, just watch Maggie,

672
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:07,343
she'll show you what to do.

673
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,971
Play your cards right and
you might end up a duchess!

674
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:11,615
Why don't you button your mouth?

675
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,974
Oh listen to the lady!

676
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,506
Don't take any notice of her.

677
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,480
Since when have you
become so high and mighty?

678
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:18,322
Since his lordship
gave up sluts like you!

679
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:19,479
Why you cow!

680
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:32,243
Very nice, very nice indeed!

681
00:39:33,911 --> 00:39:36,747
Now take these with you, room four.

682
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,734
Have you been at the bottle again?

683
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:41,085
Oh go to hell!

684
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,063
Come on you lot, you're
all on in five minutes!

685
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:44,463
Go away, we know!

686
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,729
Buddy, we brought some extra ammunition!

687
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,762
Maggie, you're looking enchanting!

688
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:54,682
I'm Margaret and this
is Hazel, she's new!

689
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,393
Oh, fascinating,
now come over here my dear!

690
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:59,395
Come on luv he's not gonna bite you!

691
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,063
I wouldn't bank on that my dear!

692
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,691
Go on dear, do like the gentlemen!

693
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:04,983
Sit down!

694
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,614
A glass of champagne?

695
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:11,907
No thank you sir, I don't drink!

696
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,285
- She is new!
- Of course she drinks!

697
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,887
If the young lady doesn't want to drink

698
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:16,996
she doesn't have to!

699
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:20,499
I like a girl that, knows her own mind!

700
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,792
Thank you sir.

701
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,045
You don't have to call me sir my dear.

702
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:26,839
Tom's the name.
- But I don't know you.

703
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,383
Oh she's a card this one, always joking!

704
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:32,053
Call him Tom!

705
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:33,846
All right, Tom.

706
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:37,933
Are you quite sure you
won't have one my dear?

707
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:41,395
All right then, perhaps just this once.

708
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:43,981
Oh are you sure my dear?

709
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,776
I don't want you to do anything

710
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:49,111
that you don't want to do.

711
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,821
Oh I'd like too.

712
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:52,698
We'll take ours in the other room!

713
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,952
Have fun children!

714
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,539
Where have they gone?

715
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:02,311
They thought we'd like to be alone.

716
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:04,460
What for I thought
we were having a party?

717
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:08,798
And we are, a private,
intimate party, just you and I!

718
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,174
Oh well, I don't even...

719
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:12,218
Now come on, finish up
your bubbly.

720
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,222
Won't do any harm, you like it don't you?

721
00:41:16,514 --> 00:41:18,391
Drink it up lass, right to the bottom,

722
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:21,435
come on now, that's it.

723
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:24,021
There it wasn't so bad was it?

724
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,524
Yeah yeah, you like me don't you?

725
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:28,609
You seem very kind.

726
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,737
Seeings how you like me...

727
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:33,389
What about giving me a
little kiss?

728
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,447
I shall do nothing!

729
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,784
Just one little mmm...

730
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:43,082
Oh champagne, he poured
champagne all over!

731
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:45,626
Oh, look at me!

732
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:48,337
Come come darling this way!

733
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,758
I think I better be going!

734
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,136
- Come here!
- Oh I must go!

735
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:56,947
Not what about the kiss
you're gonna give me!

736
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:58,097
Leave me alone!

737
00:41:58,389 --> 00:41:59,389
Let me go!

738
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:04,478
I like a girl with a little spirit!

739
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,605
Look what you've done!

740
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:10,276
You've ruined my dress!
- Take it off then!

741
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:12,444
Ah!

742
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,322
You little...

743
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,329
What are you doing here?

744
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:25,082
That man, he tore my dress!

745
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:27,209
Well, don't be so stupid girl!

746
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,588
What do you think you went up there for?

747
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:34,300
Hey come back here you little fool!

748
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:36,552
Well don't just stand there, go after her!

749
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:40,014
We don't want no trouble with the police!

750
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:43,893
Miss, come back!

751
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,773
That man,

752
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,357
is he after you?

753
00:42:50,649 --> 00:42:51,692
Down here!

754
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:54,069
Miss, come back!

755
00:43:15,424 --> 00:43:17,885
Thank you, thank you so much!

756
00:43:20,387 --> 00:43:22,765
Are you Mary Clark?

757
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,416
Help!

758
00:44:10,855 --> 00:44:13,899
Do you like
policeman for one evening?

759
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:15,191
Fine.

760
00:44:18,904 --> 00:44:19,905
The Ripper!

761
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,617
The Ripper's done it again!

762
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:38,381
Lowry!

763
00:44:39,216 --> 00:44:40,443
I thought you'd have an explanation for

764
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,307
bringing my ward to an
establishment like this?

765
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:44,184
- I brought him.
- I find that hard to believe,

766
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:45,931
however luckily I happened to see you!

767
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:48,100
Come along my dear, I'll take you home.

768
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:50,185
- You'd better go.
- Well if you say so.

769
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:51,705
I assume you're off to join the morbid

770
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:54,940
and the sensation seekers
at the scene of the crime.

771
00:44:55,232 --> 00:44:55,816
I've had a most pleasant evening,

772
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:57,348
thank you very much, goodnight.

773
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,611
- Goodnight.
- Sir.

774
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:00,297
I don't approve of Mr. Lowry any more

775
00:45:00,321 --> 00:45:01,721
than I approve of places like this.

776
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:03,133
- Well why are you here?
- Since you must know

777
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:04,837
I didn't believe your story of the concert

778
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:08,203
and I followed you, now, shall we go home?

779
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:27,253
Has anyone sent for a doctor?

780
00:45:27,473 --> 00:45:30,392
- Undertaker more like it!
- A wagon's been sent for.

781
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:31,745
- Inspector O'Neill?
- Yeah he's been

782
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:32,353
sent for too sir.

783
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:33,187
Why ain't O'Neill here,

784
00:45:33,479 --> 00:45:34,839
then it might never have happened!

785
00:45:34,939 --> 00:45:35,999
He's never here when he's wanted!

786
00:45:36,023 --> 00:45:37,125
- Ain't safe no more!
- Come on why don't you

787
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:40,319
go home, huh?
- Yeah get rid of them all!

788
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,335
- It's him!
- He's the Ripper!

789
00:45:56,627 --> 00:45:58,147
- Hold on to him!
- Look at that knife!

790
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:00,130
That's what he did her with!

791
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:02,967
You're the Ripper aren't ya!

792
00:46:03,258 --> 00:46:04,802
He's dumb, can't talk!

793
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,845
You're right!

794
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:08,263
Let's get him!

795
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:34,038
Come on!

796
00:47:24,548 --> 00:47:25,548
Grab him!

797
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:32,014
Now, let's see how you like it!

798
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:35,683
Now...

799
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,355
Oh, me arm!

800
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:41,833
You broke it!
- It'll be your head

801
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:43,293
next time, now get out of here before

802
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:44,693
I forget that I'm a policeman!

803
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:47,196
Move, go on, home all of you!

804
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:49,781
Come on men!

805
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:55,287
I went to see the home
secretary personally!

806
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,581
He was delighted, delighted!

807
00:47:57,873 --> 00:47:59,601
There'll be a promotion
in this for you O'Neill!

808
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,210
I'm not making any promises though,

809
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:03,378
but there's every chance!

810
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,689
What do you think of that eh?

811
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:06,633
- Oh, very gratifying sir.
- I thought you'd feel

812
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:11,136
that way, now, I think we'll
keep the fiend here tonight.

813
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:12,781
Have to organize well
of course the crowd will

814
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:14,473
probably try to rob us of our prey.

815
00:48:14,765 --> 00:48:16,618
And then tomorrow morning
we'll move him, and...

816
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:18,352
Can't move him sir.

817
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:19,853
Can't?

818
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:21,480
Why not?
- He hasn't been charged

819
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:22,772
with anything.

820
00:48:24,525 --> 00:48:25,565
You're joking of course.

821
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:28,362
I put Benz into protective
custody sir, nothing more.

822
00:48:28,654 --> 00:48:32,074
Well go down to his cell
and charge him, right away!

823
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:35,244
- With what?
- Murder, multiple murder!

824
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:37,538
He is Jack the Ripper!
- Is he?

825
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:38,539
What do you mean is he, of course he is,

826
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:39,991
you locked him up didn't you?

827
00:48:40,165 --> 00:48:41,542
Protective custody I said sir.

828
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:42,834
I'm sorry sir these

829
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:46,004
reporters are
breaking the door down!

830
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:48,016
- Get rid of them Sergeant!
- Well they want

831
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:51,135
a statement sir!
- Do as I say, this instant!

832
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,345
Come on, get out!

833
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:54,221
What's going to happen to him?

834
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:55,740
- Has he been charged?
- What does Inspector O'Neill

835
00:48:55,764 --> 00:48:56,431
think his charges are?

836
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:57,391
Can O'Neill make a statement?

837
00:48:57,683 --> 00:48:59,661
Gentlemen please, you've all
heard the official statement,

838
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:00,845
I'm afraid I can't add to it!

839
00:49:01,061 --> 00:49:02,301
Louis Benz an employee at the

840
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:04,434
Mercy Hospital for Women
has been taken into custody.

841
00:49:04,565 --> 00:49:05,274
Now what sort of a statement is that?

842
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:06,751
- That's right!
- The official sort,

843
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:07,794
and that's all you're gonna get!

844
00:49:07,818 --> 00:49:09,018
- Where's O'Neill?
- Aren't you

845
00:49:09,153 --> 00:49:10,338
Sir David Roberts?
- Benz works at your hospital,

846
00:49:10,362 --> 00:49:11,422
what do you think about this affair?

847
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:13,133
- Do you think Benz did it?
- Is O'Neill in here?

848
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:14,533
Yes sir but
you can't go in there!

849
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:15,951
Ah!

850
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:17,345
O'Neill what's this I hear about

851
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:18,449
Louis Benz being locked up?

852
00:49:18,579 --> 00:49:19,288
- That's right sir.
- What do you

853
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,122
mean that's right?

854
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:21,414
Release him immediately!

855
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:22,856
- For what may I ask?
- Who are you?

856
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,435
This is Assistant Commissioner Hodges

857
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:25,669
of Scotland Yard, Sir David.

858
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,880
Ah good, I bet you
can talk some sense into

859
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:29,423
this mutton-headed policeman.

860
00:49:29,715 --> 00:49:31,035
Tell him to release Benz at once!

861
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,801
I shall do no such thing!

862
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:34,779
Who do you think you are,
barging in here like this,

863
00:49:34,803 --> 00:49:36,889
giving me instructions?
- Never mind who I am,

864
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,515
do as I tell you!

865
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:40,392
You realize of course that this Benz

866
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:41,685
is Jack the Ripper!

867
00:49:41,977 --> 00:49:43,562
Balderdash!

868
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:45,898
Whose idea is that, yours O'Neill?

869
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,359
- Eh, no sir.
- Yours then I suppose?

870
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:51,291
Really Mr. Assistant Commissioner I think

871
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,714
the Metropolitan Police Force is staffed

872
00:49:52,738 --> 00:49:53,738
by a bunch of half-wits!

873
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:55,709
And none so half-witted
as those at the top!

874
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:57,741
What put that damn fool
idea into your head anyway?

875
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:00,787
Benz was carrying a bag
full of surgical instruments!

876
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,708
Oh was he now, well of
course that makes a difference.

877
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,170
What do you suppose these are, toothpicks?

878
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:09,838
Go on arrest me!

879
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,941
While you're at it try locking
up the rest of my staff,

880
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:13,217
Tranter, Urquhart all of us,

881
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:14,218
there's not one Jack the Ripper,

882
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:15,589
there's half a dozen of us!

883
00:50:15,636 --> 00:50:17,012
We take it in turns!

884
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,515
Louis Benz is in protective custody.

885
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:22,017
He hasn't yet been charged.

886
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,727
I, we thought it was

887
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:26,021
the only safe place for him.

888
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:28,193
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?

889
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:30,025
I'm still not saying
he isn't the Ripper!

890
00:50:30,317 --> 00:50:31,944
Then you're still being asinine!

891
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,172
And I'm going to see the home
secretary and tell him so!

892
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:35,196
Goodnight sir!

893
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:41,995
Shall I go downstairs
now sir and charge Benz?

894
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:46,667
Nnn, no, no O'Neill,
we'll leave it for a while.

895
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,378
Well if you'll pardon
me sir, I have work to do.

896
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:50,963
What's that?

897
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:55,008
I'm going to try and
find Jack the Ripper.

898
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Come on Sam.

899
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,805
My life Mr. O'Neill, how was I to know

900
00:51:00,097 --> 00:51:00,806
the poor little thing was going to

901
00:51:01,098 --> 00:51:02,766
get herself carved up by the Ripper?

902
00:51:03,058 --> 00:51:04,559
You can't blame me for that, can you?

903
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:06,246
What was it that sent her running out

904
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,521
into the night on her own?

905
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:09,415
I can't blame you for
that either I suppose?

906
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,439
- Well I...
- Well?

907
00:51:10,691 --> 00:51:12,484
I've got to make a living Mr. O'Neill!

908
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,028
The legitimate side of the
business don't pay nothing!

909
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,322
People come in here, they buy half a beer

910
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:18,774
and they sit all the evening!

911
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:20,701
I've got to make a living!

912
00:51:20,993 --> 00:51:22,828
The suit, now mind the suit Mr. O'Neill!

913
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,997
Listen you, it so happens that I've got

914
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:27,666
something else that's
taking up all of my time,

915
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,644
but as soon as I clear
it up you better start

916
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:31,308
looking for a new way of making a living,

917
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:33,356
because I'm gonna close
this place up so tight

918
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,091
it won't see daylight for 20 years!

919
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:40,637
Flaming busy body,

920
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,848
I hope the Ripper carves him up!

921
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,140
I came long here sir,

922
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:46,391
and just there was where
I saw the courting couple,

923
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:47,144
and then I went on to...

924
00:51:47,436 --> 00:51:47,978
Courting couple in this door?

925
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,789
Yes that's right sir,
and then I went on...

926
00:51:49,813 --> 00:51:51,373
That's where you discovered the body.

927
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:53,525
Oh no sir, down here...

928
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:56,236
Hey wait a minute,
you're right Mr. O'Neill!

929
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:58,280
You're dead right!

930
00:51:58,572 --> 00:51:59,892
So he wasn't caught in after all!

931
00:52:00,157 --> 00:52:01,717
The Ripper Harry, you saw the Ripper!

932
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:02,825
Oh god!

933
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:04,220
Harry what did this man look like?

934
00:52:04,244 --> 00:52:05,370
Well I don't know sir,

935
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:07,247
I didn't really look at him actually.

936
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:09,624
Hey wait a minute, if he was the Ripper,

937
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:10,584
I heard him talk!

938
00:52:10,876 --> 00:52:11,996
- Talk?
- What was he saying?

939
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,325
Well I just passed by still
looking for the young lady,

940
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:16,673
and him say, is your name,

941
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:18,245
is your name something or other.

942
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,719
Well what Harry, is your name what?

943
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,889
Mary, Mary it was, Mary something.

944
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:26,808
- Think man think!
- I am thinking sir.

945
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,810
Mary, Mary, Mary Clark!

946
00:52:30,812 --> 00:52:34,399
That was it, is your name Mary Clark!

947
00:52:34,691 --> 00:52:35,859
Mary Clark.

948
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:37,151
Ring any bells then?

949
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:38,362
Not right off.

950
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:39,756
All right Harry you can go now,

951
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,382
not a word of this to
anyone, do you understand?

952
00:52:41,406 --> 00:52:42,566
Yes sir, if you say so sir!

953
00:52:42,657 --> 00:52:43,367
- I say so!
- That's so you

954
00:52:43,658 --> 00:52:44,201
don't forget huh?

955
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:46,661
Oh thanks Mr. Lowry,
goodnight, goodnight sir!

956
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:47,954
Goodnight.

957
00:52:48,246 --> 00:52:50,415
Mary Clark, I wonder who she is?

958
00:52:50,707 --> 00:52:51,934
Wherever she is the
Ripper's looking for her

959
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,078
but he hasn't found her yet.

960
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:55,021
That doesn't explain why
these other young girls

961
00:52:55,045 --> 00:52:56,045
have been butchered.

962
00:52:56,129 --> 00:52:57,857
Why, they could identify
him couldn't they?

963
00:52:57,881 --> 00:53:02,260
Yeah, let's hope for her
sake we find her first.

964
00:53:02,552 --> 00:53:05,180
Kitty you're not well enough yet.

965
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,142
Anne you speak to her.

966
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,103
Won't do any good.

967
00:53:11,395 --> 00:53:14,189
Just a few more days,
until you're really strong.

968
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:16,024
No thank you it's all the same.

969
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:17,609
I want to go home.

970
00:53:22,614 --> 00:53:26,076
All right Kitty, but I want
you to promise me something.

971
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:27,494
- What?
- That you'll let me

972
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:29,162
come and visit you.

973
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:31,956
Morning.

974
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,107
- Morning sir.
- Urquhart you'll have

975
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:36,854
to get someone else to
assist in the theater.

976
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:38,398
Those idiots have still
got Benz locked up.

977
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:40,757
- Yes.
- Hello dear, you one of mine?

978
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:42,384
Oh, Dr. Tranter's case sir.

979
00:53:42,676 --> 00:53:43,876
She's asking to be discharged.

980
00:53:43,927 --> 00:53:46,012
I told her I do not
consider her fit enough.

981
00:53:46,304 --> 00:53:47,806
Hmm, what does Dr. Tranter say?

982
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:50,392
He says we can't hold
her against her will.

983
00:53:50,684 --> 00:53:51,226
Afraid he's right.

984
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:53,478
If she insists on leaving
we can't stop her.

985
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,998
But I must say I think you're
being very foolish young lady.

986
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:57,702
The doctor here knows what's best for you.

987
00:53:57,941 --> 00:53:59,484
I still want to go home sir.

988
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:01,486
All right Urquhart, sign the discharge.

989
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:02,797
- Yes sir.
- Don't forget about

990
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:03,840
the theater assistant will you?

991
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:04,864
No sir.

992
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,591
I think this is him.

993
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,260
Your name's Clark, isn't it?

994
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:26,928
- Yeah.
- I'm Inspector O'Neill

995
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Good luck!

996
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:31,141
Lord help me governor, I'm!

997
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,119
This fellow said to me
did I want to make me self

998
00:54:33,143 --> 00:54:35,645
a couple of quid and I said
no, not if it ain't honest!

999
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:36,980
Anyway I wasn't there!

1000
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:39,375
Records show that you have
a daughter Mary, Mary Clark.

1001
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:41,401
Even if I had'a been there I wouldn't...

1002
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:42,986
What Mary?

1003
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:45,030
What's my
poor little baby daughter

1004
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:46,323
got to do with all this?

1005
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:47,675
If you have a daughter Mary...

1006
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:50,118
Yeah and a sweeter,
kinder girl never lived!

1007
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,037
She depends on my you know, I'm her only

1008
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:55,499
means of support, if you locks
me up she'll starve to death!

1009
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:56,851
We're not gonna lock you up Clark,

1010
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,252
we just want to find
out about your daughter.

1011
00:54:59,544 --> 00:55:00,544
- Honest?
- That's all.

1012
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:02,475
It's not about the
Houston Road job then,

1013
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:03,691
the one where I wasn't there?

1014
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:05,315
No we just want to find your daughter.

1015
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,552
Ooh, I can't help you I'm afraid.

1016
00:55:07,844 --> 00:55:08,553
What's that supposed to mean?

1017
00:55:08,845 --> 00:55:10,615
Why I aint seen the
little snot for 10 years!

1018
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,283
- You just said...
- Ah that's flannel guv,

1019
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:13,547
just flannel!
- You have no idea

1020
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,920
where she is?
- And I forgot I had

1021
00:55:15,143 --> 00:55:16,996
a daughter till that other
fellow come looking for her!

1022
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,860
- What other fellow?
- I don't know who he was,

1023
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:21,900
about four months ago,
posh feller he was too!

1024
00:55:22,192 --> 00:55:22,859
What'd he look like?

1025
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:25,031
I didn't see him properly
because it was dark,

1026
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,989
but he was a posh fella, here,

1027
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:29,681
he was carrying a little black bag.

1028
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:19,358
Well, so much for that fool idea

1029
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:21,084
of Louis Benz being the Ripper.

1030
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:22,752
I've already released him.

1031
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:24,129
About time too.

1032
00:56:24,421 --> 00:56:26,256
Take that Urquhart.
- Right sir.

1033
00:56:26,548 --> 00:56:30,885
The whole idea was a
lot of nonsense anyway.

1034
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:32,846
- Pawn ticket.
- No name.

1035
00:56:33,138 --> 00:56:34,598
Here, here we are.

1036
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:38,977
Grace Merchant.

1037
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,743
- Hello Kitty.
- Hello Miss.

1038
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,329
- May I come in?
- If you want to.

1039
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,205
Well of course I want to.

1040
00:56:59,497 --> 00:57:02,042
You said I could come and visit you.

1041
00:57:02,334 --> 00:57:03,418
What'd you come out for?

1042
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,710
To see how you were.

1043
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:06,880
Oh I'm all right thank you.

1044
00:57:07,172 --> 00:57:08,532
Well then, do you need anything?

1045
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:09,799
No thank you.

1046
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:12,802
Oh, lovely flowers.

1047
00:57:14,846 --> 00:57:16,931
Is this your young man?

1048
00:57:17,223 --> 00:57:19,684
- Leave it alone.
- I'm sorry, I,

1049
00:57:19,976 --> 00:57:22,395
I didn't mean to upset you.

1050
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,271
I shouldn't have behaved like that

1051
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:24,923
it was very rude of me, I'm sorry.

1052
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,566
That's all right.

1053
00:57:29,152 --> 00:57:31,237
It was my young man.

1054
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:33,448
We were gonna be married.

1055
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:38,620
He found out about, well
my life before I met him.

1056
00:57:38,912 --> 00:57:40,789
The men I've been with.

1057
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,201
Don't think you'd understand

1058
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:44,376
like for a girl like me.

1059
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,878
I'm not much good, never was.

1060
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:49,923
Then I met him.

1061
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:52,509
He was very kind.

1062
00:57:53,968 --> 00:57:55,512
He said he loved me.

1063
00:57:57,138 --> 00:57:59,182
I wanted to tell him all about myself,

1064
00:57:59,474 --> 00:58:00,475
and what I was.

1065
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:05,146
But somehow each time I
was going to I put it off.

1066
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:07,857
And then one day, he found out,

1067
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:12,112
and the next day they found
his body in the river.

1068
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:15,031
Kitty!

1069
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:16,866
Oh how dreadful!

1070
00:58:17,158 --> 00:58:18,535
I-I'm so sorry!
- I'll be all right

1071
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:19,827
in a moment.

1072
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:24,040
I'm sorry, can I get you
something, a cup of tea...

1073
00:58:24,332 --> 00:58:26,793
You stay there, I'll get it.

1074
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:52,736
Kitty, when was the last time
you had something to eat?

1075
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:54,946
Yesterday evening,
but I'll be all right.

1076
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:57,358
I'm going out later to see
a woman I know about a job.

1077
00:58:57,574 --> 00:58:59,409
But you won't get paid
for at least a week,

1078
00:58:59,701 --> 00:59:01,619
in the meantime you've got to eat.

1079
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:03,711
Look I'll put you down
on the parish register.

1080
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:05,391
That way you can get
food from the hospital.

1081
00:59:05,415 --> 00:59:06,434
I don't want any charity.

1082
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:07,500
Now don't be so silly.

1083
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:09,112
You've been ill, if you don't eat

1084
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:11,212
you'll find yourself back in the hospital.

1085
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,506
It's cheaper for us to keep you out.

1086
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:15,067
Oh have you got a birth certificate?

1087
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:16,468
Yes, what you want it for?

1088
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,680
Well I have to have it
for the parish register.

1089
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Oh.

1090
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:22,139
Fine.

1091
00:59:23,725 --> 00:59:25,643
I'll call around later this evening,

1092
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:27,103
bring you a hamper.

1093
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:29,275
Oh I don't want you to
go to any trouble Miss.

1094
00:59:29,355 --> 00:59:30,899
Oh it's no trouble.

1095
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:34,109
Good.

1096
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,033
Thank you Miss, you're very kind.

1097
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:42,494
See you later this evening.

1098
01:02:32,121 --> 01:02:33,581
Oh!

1099
01:02:33,873 --> 01:02:34,415
I thought it was you.

1100
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:36,852
I've been following you, you
shouldn't have tried to hide!

1101
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:38,378
Now then, what's going on here?

1102
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,670
How did you two get in?

1103
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:42,173
- The gate was open.
- Oh was it now?

1104
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:43,758
We'll have to see about that.

1105
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,635
And I'll ask you both to leave!

1106
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:46,927
- Of course.
- But...

1107
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:48,721
We'll leave at once.

1108
01:02:58,523 --> 01:02:59,523
Anne!

1109
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:02,360
What's the matter?

1110
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:04,332
I, I saw you come from
Kitty Knowles' place

1111
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:05,113
and I tried to catch up with you,

1112
01:03:05,405 --> 01:03:07,115
but you were going so fast.

1113
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:09,158
I, I was frightened.

1114
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,450
Frightened?

1115
01:03:10,702 --> 01:03:11,744
What on earth...

1116
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:18,334
Oh no, wait a minute,
you didn't think that I,

1117
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:20,253
that I... !

1118
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:23,047
Oh Anne!

1119
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:25,466
Oh come on, I'll walk back to the

1120
01:03:25,758 --> 01:03:29,762
hospital with you!

1121
01:03:30,054 --> 01:03:31,472
Give me the clips.

1122
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,308
You put that one there.

1123
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,978
Not there idiot, there, and hurry!

1124
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:46,988
It's no good Benz, leave her alone.

1125
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,823
Let her die in peace.

1126
01:03:50,366 --> 01:03:54,162
Just looking in to see
if everything's all right.

1127
01:03:54,454 --> 01:03:56,539
What's the matter Louis?

1128
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:59,500
What's that, let me have a look!

1129
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:02,837
It's no good sir, she's going to die.

1130
01:04:04,338 --> 01:04:06,619
Nonsense, no one dies while
their heart's still beating!

1131
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:07,901
We must hurry, get that clip out,

1132
01:04:07,925 --> 01:04:08,634
it's tangling the blood vessel!

1133
01:04:08,926 --> 01:04:12,889
Louis, I want swabs, clips,
sterilizing pan, quickly!

1134
01:04:43,294 --> 01:04:45,004
Hello dear.

1135
01:04:45,296 --> 01:04:47,006
What's the matter?

1136
01:04:47,298 --> 01:04:49,217
I feel a bit tired, I'm going home.

1137
01:04:49,509 --> 01:04:50,009
Are you ready?

1138
01:04:50,301 --> 01:04:52,095
Oh, I have some work to do first.

1139
01:04:52,386 --> 01:04:55,306
Anyway Mr. Lowry's calling for me later.

1140
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:57,598
Kitty Knowles, isn't that
the girl I operated on?

1141
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,185
- Yes.
- Mary Clark.

1142
01:05:00,353 --> 01:05:02,897
It's on her birth certificate.

1143
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:06,776
Well if you're not
coming home I'll get along.

1144
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:09,320
Well, she'll be all right, eh Tranter?

1145
01:05:09,612 --> 01:05:10,672
Yes sir I think she will.

1146
01:05:10,696 --> 01:05:12,031
Of course she will.

1147
01:05:12,323 --> 01:05:13,533
- Sir David?
- What is it?

1148
01:05:13,825 --> 01:05:17,245
I, I'd like you to
accept my resignation.

1149
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:18,830
Uncle!

1150
01:05:19,122 --> 01:05:20,414
Resignation?

1151
01:05:20,706 --> 01:05:21,791
What are you talking about?

1152
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,501
Well you saw what happened here.

1153
01:05:23,793 --> 01:05:24,418
If you hadn't arrived when you did,

1154
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,962
that girl would have died.

1155
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:28,174
Even Louis Benz knew when
I was making a mistake.

1156
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:30,067
Good heavens man, that's
no reason to resign!

1157
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:31,342
I think it is.

1158
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,636
I feel I've come to the
end of my work here.

1159
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:35,096
Nonsense!

1160
01:05:35,388 --> 01:05:36,931
You've been over working, that's all.

1161
01:05:37,223 --> 01:05:38,307
You need a rest.

1162
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:40,726
Look, why not take a couple of weeks off?

1163
01:05:41,018 --> 01:05:42,338
Then if you still want to resign,

1164
01:05:42,478 --> 01:05:44,063
we can talk about it again.

1165
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:46,023
- Very well sir.
- I'll walk to the

1166
01:05:46,315 --> 01:05:47,358
gates with you.

1167
01:05:49,026 --> 01:05:50,528
And Tranter, you'll never come

1168
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,989
to the end of your work
here, remember that.

1169
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:54,907
Thank you sir, goodnight.

1170
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,993
- Goodnight.
- Excuse me.

1171
01:06:06,252 --> 01:06:10,047
But Uncle, because of one small error?

1172
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:11,799
I've told you why.

1173
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:13,235
I feel I've accomplished everything

1174
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:15,761
that I set out to do
in this part of London.

1175
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:17,388
There's no more for me.

1176
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,390
Sir David's suggestion was right.

1177
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:21,225
Take two weeks rest.

1178
01:06:21,517 --> 01:06:23,436
Goodnight my dear.

1179
01:06:23,728 --> 01:06:25,229
And don't be too late home.

1180
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:27,356
I'll be all right.

1181
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,837
Hello Hodges.

1182
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:34,339
Miss Anne still here?

1183
01:07:34,423 --> 01:07:34,966
She had to go out sir,

1184
01:07:35,258 --> 01:07:36,944
took a hamper of food
to that Kitty Knowles.

1185
01:07:36,968 --> 01:07:38,088
She said would you wait sir.

1186
01:07:38,261 --> 01:07:39,261
Thanks.

1187
01:08:39,196 --> 01:08:40,196
Kitty?

1188
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:42,907
Kitty?

1189
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,972
Mary Clark.

1190
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:06,264
Here!

1191
01:09:07,058 --> 01:09:09,727
Why you're...
- No matter who I am.

1192
01:09:10,644 --> 01:09:12,563
And you knew my son rather well.

1193
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:13,855
Your son?

1194
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:17,360
Oh you're Paul's father!

1195
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:19,362
I was.

1196
01:09:19,653 --> 01:09:22,823
- What do you want?
- I want my son.

1197
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,242
But he'd dead isn't he?

1198
01:09:25,534 --> 01:09:27,119
You killed him.

1199
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,788
- I killed him?
- As surely as if

1200
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,874
you'd plant a knife into his heart.

1201
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,377
He was gonna be a surgeon you know,

1202
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:37,004
a brilliant surgeon, a genius.

1203
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:40,341
But you turned his mind,

1204
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:42,468
even drove my boy to suicide!

1205
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:43,760
No I loved him!

1206
01:09:43,886 --> 01:09:46,555
How dare you speak of love!

1207
01:09:46,847 --> 01:09:48,474
You defile the word!

1208
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:51,018
Like some foul, malignant
virus you and your kind

1209
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,728
contaminate the gutter you inhabit!

1210
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,271
The very air you breathe!

1211
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:55,564
No one is safe!

1212
01:09:55,856 --> 01:09:58,442
I've been sweeping the
streets looking for you

1213
01:09:58,734 --> 01:10:01,987
Mary Clark, scouring the pavements,

1214
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:03,697
so young men may be safe!

1215
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:06,075
Young men like, like, Paul.

1216
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:09,537
Paul, Paul!

1217
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:10,829
You're ill!

1218
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:15,584
Yes I know.

1219
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,423
A virus, I must kill the virus,

1220
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:23,384
I must kill it before it's too late!

1221
01:10:23,676 --> 01:10:25,177
Destroy it, now Mary!

1222
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Anne!

1223
01:12:00,231 --> 01:12:01,231
Anne!

1224
01:12:06,487 --> 01:12:07,487
Anne!

1225
01:12:08,781 --> 01:12:10,221
Did you see, did you see who it was?

1226
01:12:10,366 --> 01:12:12,826
No!

1227
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,583
Mary!

1228
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,884
All right, all right, all right

1229
01:12:29,176 --> 01:12:31,845
all right, what's all this noise about?

1230
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:33,257
Come on you idiot open up!

1231
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:35,683
Of course!

1232
01:12:35,975 --> 01:12:36,975
Why what's happened?

1233
01:12:37,142 --> 01:12:38,936
You're covered in blood!

1234
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:45,109
Are you all right?

1235
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:25,131
O'Neill will be here in a minute.

1236
01:13:25,232 --> 01:13:26,232
You know what to do.

1237
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:27,526
Yes I think so.

1238
01:14:00,517 --> 01:14:02,811
Good evening Sir David.

1239
01:14:03,103 --> 01:14:05,022
Yeah, what do you want?

1240
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:07,691
- Working late aren't you?
- Obviously.

1241
01:14:07,983 --> 01:14:09,318
What are you doing here?

1242
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,171
Oh I have reason to believe the Ripper

1243
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:12,395
is somewhere in this hospital.

1244
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:13,655
Nonsense.

1245
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:16,116
The porter's just been attacked.

1246
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:17,117
Why should that lead you to believe

1247
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:19,078
the Ripper's in the building?

1248
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:20,079
I was under the impression he confined

1249
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:21,371
his attacks to women.

1250
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:23,142
Well there has been another killing,

1251
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:27,086
only this time he was
forced to leave in a hurry.

1252
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:29,755
He left this behind.

1253
01:14:30,047 --> 01:14:33,133
Well, just like my bag, eh Mr. Lowry?

1254
01:14:35,678 --> 01:14:37,388
Now if you don't mind I have work to do!

1255
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,682
Good evening Sir David.

1256
01:14:39,973 --> 01:14:41,653
Look here Inspector, this is a mortuary,

1257
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:42,809
not a public art gallery!

1258
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:45,220
I'm sorry sir but I came
to see you about the porter.

1259
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:47,022
Mr. Lowry's already informed me!

1260
01:14:47,314 --> 01:14:48,982
The porter was murdered by some ruffian.

1261
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:51,902
I didn't say he'd
been murdered Sir David.

1262
01:14:52,194 --> 01:14:53,946
I said he'd been attacked.

1263
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:56,657
Well you uh, you implied it then.

1264
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:58,909
He's been taken to
the operating theater.

1265
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:00,641
Dr. Urquhart thinks he can be saved,

1266
01:15:00,703 --> 01:15:03,288
he'd like you to operate.

1267
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,583
Well that's, that's quite impossible!

1268
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:07,995
Well can't you see I'm busy,

1269
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:10,379
I've got to finish this post mortem!

1270
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:12,511
I think you'd better
come to the theater sir.

1271
01:15:12,589 --> 01:15:14,383
Are you telling me what to do Inspector?

1272
01:15:14,675 --> 01:15:16,009
Yes sir I am.

1273
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:18,679
It is impertinence, gross impertinence!

1274
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:21,473
Possibly, but we want
to save this man's life.

1275
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:25,310
You're a doctor, surely
that's your wish too.

1276
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:30,149
Very well, I'll see what I can do.

1277
01:15:31,608 --> 01:15:33,569
Thank you sir.

1278
01:16:27,873 --> 01:16:29,208
Sir David please!

1279
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:37,132
This hospital's becoming
like Piccadilly Circus!

1280
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:39,593
If I see this man I must see him alone.

1281
01:16:39,885 --> 01:16:43,180
Is that clear?
- Perfectly clear Sir David.

1282
01:16:43,472 --> 01:16:45,057
How is he Dr. Urquhart?

1283
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,986
He's regaining consciousness slowly.

1284
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,200
It's all right Hodges,

1285
01:17:03,492 --> 01:17:06,411
Sir David's here to look after you now.

1286
01:17:32,563 --> 01:17:34,857
, ground floor!

1287
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:42,155
Around the front!

1288
01:18:28,368 --> 01:18:29,470
Why we didn't take him to the morgue

1289
01:18:29,494 --> 01:18:30,913
in the first place beats me!

1290
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:34,625
Poor Alfred, even I
could see he was dead.

1291
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:10,494
Turn it off!

1292
01:19:10,786 --> 01:19:11,786
Turn it off!

1293
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:17,084
Turn it off!

1294
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:18,376
Turn it off!

1295
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:20,378
Turn it off!

1296
01:19:22,047 --> 01:19:23,047
Turn it off!

1297
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:57,499
But you don't know, not for sure.

1298
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,376
Oh we know, we can't prove it.

1299
01:19:59,668 --> 01:20:01,336
And we'll never be able to prove it.

1300
01:20:01,628 --> 01:20:03,422
The most infamous
murderer since Bluebeard,

1301
01:20:03,714 --> 01:20:07,259
and the files will always
be marked, unsolved.

1302
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:08,677
Well goodnight.

1303
01:20:10,262 --> 01:20:12,222
Goodnight you two.
