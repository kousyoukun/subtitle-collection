1
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,350
Did she?

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,790
Didn't she?

3
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,710
Who's to blame?

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,480
I was an orphan.

5
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,510
Ambrose took me in.

6
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,150
He was my cousin...

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,680
but I loved him like a father.

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,510
Yes! Another!

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,710
They said, "the boy needs a mother..."

10
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,360
but the only women allowed in the house were the dogs.

11
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,270
Good girl. Good girl.

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,190
I came back from school.

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
Here, give me that.

14
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,030
What had I learned?

15
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,190
I didn't like books.

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,950
I didn't like cities.

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,270
I didn't like clever talk.

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,270
I liked it...

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,630
here.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,390
But Ambrose fell ill.

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,560
The doctors sent him off...

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,190
Go.

23
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,830
...for the sunshine.

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,280
How I missed him.

25
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,870
Every letter I shared

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,550
with my godfather and his daughter.

27
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
I've got a letter from Ambrose.

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,270
Just arrived.

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,630
Then, that summer, his letters mentioned...

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,230
Boots!

31
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,870
"My cousin, and so your cousin too,

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,600
Rachel, a widow, very good company,

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,830
who has kindly taken it upon herself

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,230
to show me all the glories of Florence.

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,750
She lives out here in the sunshine,

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,190
but is as English as you or I..."

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,110
She must be extremely charming

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,550
for Ambrose to have noticed her.

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,630
What do you mean?

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,230
Oh, I've never heard of him

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,110
admiring a woman before.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,470
Oh, she's right. Your cousin never had much need for women.

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,150
Why should he?

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
He had me.

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,190
How old is she?

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Doesn't say.

47
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,270
And by the autumn...

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,510
"Such wonderful news.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,430
Rachel and I are to marry!

50
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,030
She's agreed.

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,470
Such happiness to be so blessed.

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,110
I'm certain the moment you set eyes on her,

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,230
you'll understand.

54
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,470
She is radiant, she is good,

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,710
and she is the kindest companion."

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,910
She'll have everything turned upside down in no time.

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,870
Shan't know where we bloody are from one minute to the next.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Have you thought about the future?

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,150
Well, a home of your own?

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,740
Why on Earth should I do that?

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,630
Well,

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,070
The position's changed somewhat, hasn't it?

63
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,190
When are you expecting them?

64
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,950
No doubt in his great happiness,

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,520
he'll have forgotten all about us.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,670
Poor Philip. Are you being orphaned all over again?

67
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,830
Preposterous comment.

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,310
It's good that he's happy, isn't it?

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,230
Well, that's the whole point, surely.

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,710
- Point of what?  - Getting married.

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,230
I'm sure there'll be a letter soon.

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,590
"I have written to you several times,

73
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,950
but she watches me like a hawk

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,270
and there is no one I can trust

75
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,230
to take my letters to the mail.

76
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,310
She is away from the house today.

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,030
That's why I am able to write this.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,350
For weeks, I have been ill:

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,190
fevers, terrible headaches.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,780
I am sick of the sight of the sun.

81
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,670
As for the doctors, I don't trust any of them.

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,950
The new one, recommended by that snake Rainaldi,

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,030
is a cut-throat, I am sure."

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,550
Who's Rainaldi?

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,360
No clue.

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,840
May I see?

87
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,110
Was he drunk, do you think?

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,510
- Drunk?  - When he wrote the letter.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,510
Never.

90
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,750
Look.

91
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,870
"She has done for me at last.

92
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,590
Rachel, my torment.

93
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,110
For god's sake, come quickly."

94
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,790
Hello?

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,760
Good boy.

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,270
You must be Philip.

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,390
I've been expecting you.

98
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,870
How do you know who I am?

99
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,470
I am sure I'm not the first to notice

100
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,280
the remarkable resemblance to your cousin.

101
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,270
Please, come in. I'm nearly finished.

102
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,280
- Where is he?  - Where is he?

103
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,750
Surely, my dear fellow, you know...

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,550
he's dead.

105
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,110
Where's the woman?

106
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,670
- The woman?  - She...

107
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,750
The Rachel woman. Where is she?

108
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,550
- Gone.  - Where?

109
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,910
I have no clue. It's the truth.

110
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,710
How did he die?

111
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,870
It was a tumor, in the head. Here.

112
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
The doctors are in no doubt. It affected his brain.

113
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,150
- How?  - Oh.

114
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,790
Shouting.

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,630
Violence. Terrible distrust.

116
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,630
The doctors are all idiots, and I of course,

117
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,310
the worst idiot of all.

118
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,870
Things are thrown, glasses smashed.

119
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,150
His wife pushed up against the wall

120
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,630
and held by the throat.

121
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,510
She wants this place let. Even sold.

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,950
Your cousin Rachel, Mr. Ashley,

123
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,390
is a woman of very strong... impulse

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,270
and passion.

125
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,790
Very strong.

126
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,750
Do you understand?

127
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,750
Where are his things?

128
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,710
His clothes, his books...

129
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,390
The day after the funeral, she was gone.

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,960
Unbelievable bitch.

131
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,670
I said how much I was looking forward to seeing her.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,710
My name is Rainaldi.

133
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,550
I am your cousin's lawyer and advisor,

134
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,510
and I hope friend.

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,670
Prego.

136
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,510
A copy of the certificate of death.

137
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,470
A copy has already been sent to you in England

138
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,390
and another one to the trustee of Ambrose's will,

139
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,830
your godfather, Signor Kendall.

140
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,110
- You know all about me.  - Of course.

141
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,870
There are some remarkable things to see here.

142
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,360
Really?

143
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,510
Churches, paintings and so on.

144
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,320
- But, then again...  - What?

145
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,470
Oh, you strike me as someone perhaps more interested

146
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,150
in beer and foxes than the Rinascimento.

147
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,910
And why not?

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,390
I believe nothing of what you've told me.

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,550
I believe had I been here,

150
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,230
my cousin would still be alive.

151
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,830
And I believe that whatever it cost him

152
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,430
in pain and suffering before he died,

153
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,310
I will return in full measure

154
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,390
upon the woman that caused it.

155
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,670
He was a good man, Master Philip.

156
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,550
- May he rest in peace.  - Thank you, guy.

157
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,070
- God rest his soul.  - Right.

158
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,070
Come on, Jericho, give me that damn thing.

159
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,790
You always did scythe like a girl.

160
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,230
More beef, Master Philip?

161
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,360
Master Philip?

162
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,790
You're the master now, Master Philip.

163
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,470
You're the master.

164
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,110
It's the same will I drew up 10 years ago.

165
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,590
No provision has been made for a wife.

166
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,670
- Are you sure?  - Quite sure.

167
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
I've examined it carefully

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,190
and the accompanying letter from Signor Rainaldi.

169
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,630
There's no mention anywhere of any claim

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,430
on the part of Mrs. Ashley.

171
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,110
I'm amazed.

172
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,750
Why?

173
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,630
We know perfectly well she drove him to his death.

174
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,310
We know nothing of the sort.

175
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,630
If that's the way you're going to talk about your cousin's widow,

176
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,230
then frankly, I don't want to listen.

177
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,430
You have been extremely fortunate.

178
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,910
The entire estate will fall to you on your next birthday, as per Ambrose's wishes.

179
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,990
Surely you don't believe all this nonsense about the tumor?

180
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,750
Here is the death certificate

181
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,430
with an account of the post mortem.

182
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,870
And what possible motive could she have?

183
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,670
With nothing to gain from his death?

184
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,110
So, yes, why wouldn't I believe?

185
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,110
Ambrose wasn't my father...

186
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,230
but he was like a father.

187
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,270
In fact, better than most fathers.

188
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,510
We all miss him.

189
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,110
I miss him.

190
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,550
But you should know that the new Master Ashley

191
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,280
plans to carry on much the same as the old.

192
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,020
She's in England.

193
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,120
She's here.

194
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
I wouldn't worry.

195
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,400
She'll take one look at the place

196
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,030
and get straight back into her carriage.

197
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,430
Good.

198
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,870
Look at it. The dust.

199
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,870
She can dust it herself if it bothers her.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,550
And the smell.

201
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,310
Has every dog in the county taken a shit in here?

202
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,430
Possibly.

203
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,710
Where are you going to put her?

204
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,150
- Ambrose's room?  - No.

205
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,310
I shall take Ambrose's room.

206
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,110
She can have the blue room.

207
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,830
Really?

208
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,950
Is it watertight?

209
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,990
Should suit her perfectly.

210
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,470
What are you going to do with her?

211
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,680
Confront her.

212
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,270
Of course, she'll try and bluster her way out of it

213
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,510
- or faint...  - Mmm. Swoon, theatrically.

214
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,870
Have hysterics... isn't that what one expects of Italians?

215
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,390
Well, she's only half Italian.

216
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,310
All that macaroni. She'll probably be too fat

217
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,960
to get up the stairs.

218
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,590
I want justice for Ambrose.

219
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,390
I think you're nervous.

220
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,590
Not at all.

221
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,550
- Would you like me to stay?  - What do you mean?

222
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,590
I mean, to be here?

223
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,710
What time are you expecting her?

224
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,470
I think I can manage.

225
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,790
You really are nervous, aren't you?

226
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,470
I just want to be on my own for...

227
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,510
- I'm sorry.  - No, no, no. Not at all.

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,560
- I quite understand.  - No, I am sorry.

229
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,550
And thank you...

230
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,030
for everything...

231
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,710
for the flowers and offering to stay.

232
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,630
Of course.

233
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,150
Good luck.

234
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,070
And try not to throttle her before dinner.

235
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,590
Make sure she waits for her dinner.

236
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,510
Make sure she holds her hunger

237
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,430
until the master of the house is back.

238
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,870
- Clear?  - Clear as day.

239
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,070
Good. Make sure of it.

240
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,710
- She's here.  - Well? No luggage?

241
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,910
Master Ambrose's things have all been put in your old room.

242
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,510
- Where is she now?  - In her room.

243
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,110
In her room. In her room.

244
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,080
Says she's tired and would you excuse her for dinner.

245
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,550
Where the devil are the dogs?

246
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,190
I think they followed her upstairs.

247
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,510
What was she like, for god's sake?

248
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,470
Couldn't say, sir.

249
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,350
Good god, man. Is she fat, thin?

250
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,950
Tall, short? Does she have a wooden leg?

251
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,040
A mustache?

252
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,990
Has she got a wart on her nose?

253
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,270
I don't know anything about that, sir.

254
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,710
The madam has sent word

255
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,150
that should you wish to pay your compliments,

256
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,700
when you have dined,

257
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,620
she would be pleased to receive you, sir.

258
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,110
Thank you, Seecombe.

259
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,750
That's it, Seecombe, thank you.

260
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,880
Come in.

261
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,560
Ambrose...

262
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,310
I am very sorry.

263
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,030
I didn't expect you to be quite so like your cousin.

264
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,990
Won't you sit down for a moment?

265
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,350
Would you like some tea?

266
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,270
Very well, if you wish.

267
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,510
Is this a smart thing to do?

268
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,670
Where you come from?

269
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,310
It's just a cup of tea.

270
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,270
I'm surprised they knew how to do this.

271
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,310
Oh, the... the butter's, erm, melting.

272
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,950
You've got... You'd better lick your fingers.

273
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,540
Smoke if you'd like.

274
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,910
Seecombe will think it very wrong.

275
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,150
He'll smell it in the morning.

276
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,590
Well, then, I'll open the window

277
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,950
before I go to bed.

278
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,350
The rain will come in and spoil the new carpet.

279
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,470
How pernickety you are.

280
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,510
I thought you lot worried about things like that.

281
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,710
- You lot?  - Women.

282
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,470
Only when they have nothing else to worry about.

283
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
Nobody seems to have been in here

284
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,790
since someone called Great Aunt Phoebe...

285
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,470
Who fell in love with a curate who didn't love her back.

286
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,070
She went away to Tonbridge Wells

287
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,310
to mend her broken heart.

288
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,790
Did Ambrose never tell you the story?

289
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,100
No, no, he never did.

290
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,230
She took a chill that lasted 20 years

291
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,910
and then she fell in love again

292
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,190
at first sight with another curate.

293
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,430
Thank heavens this one loved her back.

294
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,950
Yes. Thank heavens.

295
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,110
She died on her wedding night.

296
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,710
Oh, god. Of what?

297
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,230
Of shock, I think.

298
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,070
I think you just made that up.

299
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,190
I did nothing of the sort. Ask Seecombe.

300
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,350
Perhaps tomorrow I could borrow a horse and have a look around.

301
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,070
Such an odd feeling, driving up to the house,

302
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,800
Seecombe standing by the door to welcome me.

303
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,640
I've done it so many times in my imagination.

304
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,110
The clock struck the hour as we drove up.

305
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,470
I even seemed to recognize the sound of the bell.

306
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,510
There...

307
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,030
- You're tired.  - I'm not tired.

308
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,230
- You're half-asleep.  - No, I'm not tired.

309
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,540
I'm really not.

310
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,510
Will you please stop being so polite

311
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,710
and get up and go to bed.

312
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,870
Of course. Of course.

313
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,150
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

314
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
I, er...

315
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,950
- Sorry. I...  - Good night!

316
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,070
Yes...

317
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,950
Peter Welch.

318
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,960
Peter Welch.

319
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,950
- Morning.  - Morning.

320
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,350
That's Bawden's meadow.

321
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,390
Then Kemp's creek.

322
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,910
Er, Beef park.

323
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,750
Beacon Hill.

324
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,390
That's impossible.

325
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,710
And then in the distance with the plow on it,

326
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,390
that's the West Hill and beyond it the East Hill.

327
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,790
What else do you think we talked about?

328
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,590
Clearly I have no idea.

329
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,750
All this was his passion.

330
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,670
So I made it my passion too.

331
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,790
Everyone will be gawping at you.

332
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,630
Then I shall just gawp back.

333
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,550
We're just here.

334
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,150
...The faculties of his mind

335
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,800
are put into busy exercise

336
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,630
in the steady direction of one great and engrossing interest.

337
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,310
His attention is recalled from the many revelries...

338
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,190
...into which he might otherwise have wandered.

339
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,990
And the powers of his body are forced away from an indolence...

340
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,790
That was the easy bit.

341
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,830
I was afraid that might be the case.

342
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,470
Beautiful sermon.

343
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,670
And on that day, as twilight falls, the plowmen of the village,

344
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,670
they draw their great plow from door to door

345
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,430
and they beg a free drink,

346
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,670
and this is a great big plow

347
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,390
drawn by a handsome brace of oxen.

348
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,470
- My goodness.  - It's really...

349
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,750
It's most, most arresting.

350
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,270
- Beautiful.  - Brava.

351
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,870
So very...

352
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,630
Yes.

353
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,390
Un angelo passa...

354
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,080
Say again.

355
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,590
An angel... passes.

356
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,950
Now, who will join me

357
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,910
in drinking this delicious port wine?

358
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,830
Oh, unless, of course,

359
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,430
the men wish to retire to the next room

360
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,740
while we smoke our pipes.

361
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,990
Thank you so much for such a wonderful day.

362
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,950
Louise, thank you so much for the flowers.

363
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,230
- The beautiful flowers!  - You're very welcome!

364
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,910
Thank you! Thank you!

365
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,560
You had better hurry up and marry your Louise

366
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,430
before she gets snapped up by someone else.

367
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,750
She isn't my Louise.

368
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,190
Really? Her father seems to have other ideas.

369
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,790
Why does everyone always assume that Louise and I will marry?

370
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,150
Lift your feet.

371
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,260
Sorry.

372
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,110
She finds you very beautiful.

373
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,710
Does she now?

374
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,910
As do the Pascoe girls.

375
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,750
How terribly flattering.

376
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,470
The vicar does not agree.

377
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,310
Oh, dear.

378
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,270
- But he finds you feminine.  - Lift your feet.

379
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,150
"Extremely feminine" were his exact words.

380
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,070
I wonder in what way.

381
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,670
I suppose in a way that's different to Mrs. Pascoe.

382
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,480
Mmm. And how would you define it?

383
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,470
- Define what?  - The difference.

384
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,390
Our femininity:

385
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,710
Mrs. Pascoe's and mine.

386
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,560
God knows.

387
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,270
All I know is... I like looking at you...

388
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,000
and I don't like looking at Mrs. Pascoe.

389
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,910
All this nonsense about staying at Pelyn.

390
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,220
What's wrong with staying here?

391
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,310
I'll stay until Seecombe gets fed up with me.

392
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,350
Seecombe? See...

393
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,350
Seecombe has nothing to do with it.

394
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,030
Or I run out of money.

395
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,310
And am forced to give Italian lessons to the bored wives of the gentry.

396
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,660
No, no, no.

397
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,390
Only spinsters teach. Everybody knows that.

398
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,390
And then only when no one will support them.

399
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,880
- And what about widows?  - Widows?

400
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,840
Oh, well, widows remarry as fast as they can.

401
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,870
And if they can't do that, they just...

402
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,150
pawn their wedding rings.

403
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,470
Well...

404
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,790
I think I would prefer to give Italian lessons.

405
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,830
Good night, Philip.

406
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,310
Idiot.

407
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,470
Idiot, idiot.

408
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,590
What shall we give her?

409
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,950
Think of a figure that you consider fair and reasonable.

410
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,550
- Very well.  - Have you done it?

411
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,860
- I have.  - It's in your head?

412
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,710
- It is.  - Double it.

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,750
If we're going to do this, we have to do it properly.

414
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,270
How Ambrose would have done it.

415
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,070
As you wish.

416
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,150
- Write the letter.  - Now?

417
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,910
Oh! Were we expecting you today?

418
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,190
- I've just, uh...  - Will you take something?

419
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,910
I'm... but thanks.

420
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,270
Did he give you coffee?

421
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,910
Glad to see you've cheered up.

422
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,950
What do you mean?

423
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,390
Yesterday. You seemed all down in the dumps.

424
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm amazed you noticed.

425
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,110
We all did. I'm surprised the Pascoe girls

426
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,420
didn't remark on it. Thank you.

427
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,430
Well, the Pascoe girls were probably far too busy

428
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,710
remarking on something else.

429
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,350
What?

430
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,590
How easy it must be for a woman like your cousin Rachel

431
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,910
to twist you around her little finger.

432
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,260
Get on.

433
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,190
- Where is she?  - In the kitchen.

434
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,630
- Doing what?  - Hard to tell.

435
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,910
I do hope you don't mind.

436
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,860
Not at all.

437
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,190
- What is it?  - Tisana.

438
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,990
It's Italian tea,

439
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,470
infusions made from these herbs.

440
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,550
Here, try.

441
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,590
Try.

442
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,750
It's, um, disgusting.

443
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,840
It's good for you. It's good for the health.

444
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,600
Where have you been?

445
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,670
Out and about.

446
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,990
You made him write this!

447
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,990
What? What do you...

448
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,560
I did nothing of the sort.

449
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,360
If you had set out to humiliate me, Philip,

450
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,510
you really couldn't have got off to a better start!

451
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,750
- Why?  - Why?

452
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,430
Because now it looks as if I came begging to you!

453
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,070
But you haven't. You didn't.

454
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,830
Can't you let me be a person in my own right?

455
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,670
A woman who's making her way in the world as she wishes to.

456
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,670
Don't you see that if I had wanted your money,

457
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,030
I would have asked you for it?

458
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,910
Don't you understand it was just... It was a...

459
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,350
It was a joke about the Italian lessons.

460
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,430
- It wasn't a joke.  - Well, what if it wasn't?

461
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,750
Is there something so terribly shameful about that?

462
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,030
Yes! Yes!

463
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,390
You're Ambrose's wife.

464
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,190
I, his heir, will not permit it.

465
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,470
Do you understand? I simply...

466
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,520
I simply will not permit it. Do you understand?

467
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,470
God!

468
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,790
You'd better take something up to her.

469
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,400
Philip.

470
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,510
Did I wake you?

471
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,560
No.

472
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,590
Thank you for the note.

473
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,310
I was foul.

474
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,600
I'm sorry.

475
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,310
I would much rather you hit me than to hear you cry.

476
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,230
My mother...

477
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,510
died before I can remember.

478
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,630
I've never seen a woman cry.

479
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,830
I shall accept the allowance...

480
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,470
gratefully,

481
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,830
but I should leave.

482
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,510
- To go where?  - It doesn't matter where.

483
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,670
I thought you liked being here.

484
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,110
- Were you just being polite?  - Don't be a fool.

485
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,430
If Ambrose hadn't been such an idiot, this place would have been your home.

486
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,080
I think I'm the idiot.

487
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,990
I thought coming here would bring him back to life.

488
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,470
I don't know why you came.

489
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,830
I don't know anything about you.

490
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,080
All I know is that I like it now you're here...

491
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,310
...and I don't want you to go.

492
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,710
Is that complicated?

493
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,150
Very.

494
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,790
If you want to go, then go.

495
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,390
It'll cause a lot of talk, but...

496
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,590
Well, I would have thought it would cause a lot more talk

497
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,900
if I stayed.

498
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,910
I'll have to talk to your godfather.

499
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,510
It's no concern of his.

500
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,270
There is only one issue

501
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,230
and that's whether you want to stay or not.

502
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,390
How can you ask me that? You know the answer to that.

503
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,750
No, I don't know. Of course I don't know.

504
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,710
I don't know... That's the point.

505
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,990
So you'll stay?

506
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,550
- At least for a little while?  - I'll stay.

507
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,790
Yes, for a little while.

508
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,990
- Then I'll say good night.  - Good night.

509
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,150
- And I hope you'll sleep.  - You too.

510
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,270
And not be angry with me.

511
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,430
I wasn't angry with you, Philip.

512
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,510
Come here.

513
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,390
Bend down.

514
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,070
Now go to bed like a good boy. Go. Go.

515
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,350
- She's ready.  - Yes, I can see.

516
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,070
Er, anything more for the mail?

517
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,070
Yes.

518
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,030
In fact, why don't you leave that with me, Wellington?

519
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,630
- We can drop it off on our way.  - Very good, sir.

520
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,750
Hurry up.

521
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,830
This is a tisana made with fennel and rose hips.

522
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,950
All together...

523
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,030
it's going to make you better.

524
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,950
They'll think you're a witch.

525
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,190
Or worse, they'll call for you in the middle of the night

526
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,390
to deliver babies.

527
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Hmm, there's a tisana for that too.

528
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,710
See. Witch.

529
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,440
Why should women suffer in childbirth?

530
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,670
Is it simply their destiny to do so?

531
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,590
- I've never thought about it.  - No, of course you haven't.

532
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,670
You know nothing about women.

533
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,310
I do hope I haven't said anything to hurt you.

534
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,070
Nothing.

535
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,350
Then what is it, Philip? Please tell me.

536
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,510
Please.

537
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,230
You need to read inside the envelope itself.

538
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,790
"She has done for me at last.

539
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,550
Rachel, my torment.

540
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,030
Please come quickly."

541
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,710
How you have hated me.

542
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,880
Yes.

543
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,440
That's no use.

544
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,990
You're not the woman I hated.

545
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,670
If you don't want them, Philip,

546
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,550
do you think we might let the people

547
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,510
who live on the estate, who loved him,

548
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,710
have his clothes?

549
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,630
That's an excellent idea.

550
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,270
What do we do with it all?

551
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,350
I don't know.

552
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,590
Do you think you could wear any of it?

553
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,470
No.

554
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,470
I feel it is as if we've just opened up his coffin.

555
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,630
And we're staring down at him.

556
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,960
Rachel?

557
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,710
It's all right. Don't cry.

558
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,940
Don't cry. It's all right.

559
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,310
It's all right. It's all right.

560
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,630
- I don't want her to know.  - Sir?

561
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,230
About the tree.

562
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,080
- I want it to be a surprise.  - Very good.

563
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,590
Not like that, you fucking prick-wit!

564
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,040
It's all crooked!

565
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,630
- Sorry, sir.  - Not at all.

566
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,310
Where is she, by the way?

567
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,760
In her room.

568
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,390
It looks like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

569
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,510
Get it straightened up.

570
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,590
All right, come in.

571
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh, it's you! No, don't look.

572
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,830
Go away. Go.

573
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,950
I need something special, Mr. Couch.

574
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,430
Aren't they beautiful?

575
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,470
I've never seen anything quite like it.

576
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,350
It's the finest piece in the whole collection.

577
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,430
No question of it.

578
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,990
No one's worn them for 25 years.

579
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,510
Not since your mother's wedding.

580
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,080
Well... I want it now.

581
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,350
Is that prudent? What if it should be lost or mislaid?

582
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,510
It won't be lost, Mr. Couch.

583
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,190
And if you're worried about what my godfather might say,

584
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,390
please rest assured that he wholly approves.

585
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,830
Nevertheless, as your family lawyer for all these years,

586
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,510
I would have preferred Mr. Kendall to have been present.

587
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,510
As I say, he's away.

588
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,070
- John.  - Sir?

589
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,720
Take this to the mistress, if you will.

590
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,990
Very good, sir.

591
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,510
Thank you.

592
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,270
Thank you.

593
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,310
Good evening.

594
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,860
Good evening.

595
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,350
It's so beautiful.

596
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,200
There were three ravens on a tree

597
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,060
Hey, down down, hey, down.

598
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,040
The first one says "What's this I see?"

599
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,590
There lies a dead man in yon lea.

600
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,230
Hey, down down, down.

601
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,390
We'll sit all on his old breastbone.

602
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,910
Hey, down down, hey, down.

603
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,960
We'll sit all on his old breastbone.

604
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,750
Timothy.

605
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,590
Geoffrey.

606
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,030
Reverend Pascoe.

607
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,470
It is. Oh, it is.

608
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,750
Thank you for our gifts.

609
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,110
Thank Mrs. Ashley.

610
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,150
I will do.

611
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,390
Happy Christmas!

612
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,500
Bye, Belinda, Mary

613
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
- Bye-bye. Good luck tomorrow.  - Thank you.

614
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,720
- Where are the others?  - Upstairs, I think.

615
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,550
Actually I'm glad of this chance to have a quiet word.

616
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,110
Yes?

617
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,760
I've had some news from the bank.

618
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,190
Oh, yes.

619
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,740
Some rather disturbing news, in fact.

620
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,910
Your cousin is already severely overdrawn on her account.

621
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,110
I can only think she's been sending money out of the country.

622
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,660
To who?

623
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,840
Nonsense. No, no.

624
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,670
She's just generous.

625
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,190
Tonight, for example, you saw...

626
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,470
A gift for every family in the room.

627
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,230
That won't account for an overdraft of this magnitude.

628
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,590
Then there's all this... The fabrics, the curtains...

629
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,030
Again, I hardly think shop...

630
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,950
Shh. You simply just must increase the allowance.

631
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,270
- Increase?  - Yes.

632
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,070
Cover the overdraft.

633
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,310
I've been doing a little asking around.

634
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,710
Did you know that the duel in which her first husband died

635
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,550
was fought over one of her lovers?

636
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,630
I don't believe that.

637
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,200
They were notorious,

638
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,870
both him and her,

639
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,190
for unbridled extravagance

640
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,590
and apparently... limitless...

641
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,000
appetite.

642
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,830
Do you understand?

643
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,310
Do you?

644
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,430
I never thought you'd fall so low

645
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,950
as to listen to gossip of that sort.

646
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,590
You had no right to take that necklace.

647
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,590
It's mine and it's from the estate.

648
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,750
The estate is not yet yours, as you well know.

649
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,550
What of it? It will be soon.

650
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,350
I must ask you to desire her to return the collar.

651
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,790
Really?

652
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,510
Well, that's the last thing in the world I intend to do.

653
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,830
Then I must do it for you.

654
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,230
And I'll be damned if you will.

655
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,390
Here.

656
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,590
Louise explained.

657
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,110
It was quite right that you ask for their return.

658
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,870
- No.  - Please, Philip.

659
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,590
It was a great honor to wear them on such a special evening. Thank you.

660
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,950
I want you to wear them every night.

661
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,590
Do you need wrapping for them?

662
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,110
No, thank you.

663
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,510
Ah. There.

664
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,990
- You'll regret this.  - Be quiet.

665
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,190
You're a fool.

666
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,990
Thank you for a delightful

667
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,230
and successful evening, Philip.

668
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,460
Let's hope the dancing doesn't keep you awake all night.

669
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,750
Oh, yes.

670
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,670
May I wish you both a very Happy Christmas?

671
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,830
Oh, and you too. Merry, Merry Christmas.

672
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,510
- Happy Christmas.  - Happy Christmas, Louise.

673
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,990
- Good night, Philip.  - Happy Christmas, Philip.

674
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,710
Good night.

675
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,830
- Thank you again.  - Oh, thank you so much.

676
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,320
Such a memorable evening.

677
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,670
The snow's still falling.

678
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,710
Keep warm. Don't get wet.

679
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,670
- Merry Christmas!  - Happy Christmas.

680
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,790
Happy Christmas!

681
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,910
I wanted you to wear it...

682
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,680
to have it.

683
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,590
- Hush.  - Everything is ruined.

684
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,470
My mother wore those pearls on her wedding day...

685
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,510
and my grandmother...

686
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,510
and her mother before her.

687
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,350
That's why I was so proud and happy to wear them.

688
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,270
Had I been married here and not in Italy,

689
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,790
I should have worn them too.

690
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,990
Don't be sad.

691
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,870
Happy Christmas, dear, dear Philip.

692
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,710
We must go back to the party

693
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,430
because the guests are waiting for you.

694
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,470
Happy Christmas, Philip.

695
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,390
By rights, the jewels are yours anyway.

696
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,990
Not just the jewels, everything.

697
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,400
I'm sure there must be a will.

698
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,350
- There was.  - Ah-ha.

699
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,910
But it was never signed.

700
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,390
Do you have it? Can I see it?

701
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,070
He leaves you everything.

702
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,990
But it's not signed.

703
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,950
So? It's his handwriting.

704
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,910
January.

705
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,110
Do you know why he chose January to make his will?

706
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,710
And then chose not to sign it?

707
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,920
I lost a child.

708
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,600
- Something else died, too.  - What?

709
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,870
Hope? I don't know.

710
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,990
His belief in me, in us.

711
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,350
It made him ill.

712
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,710
I'd never felt so alone.

713
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,030
One day, I woke up and I found myself...

714
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,630
living with a stranger...

715
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,870
who hated me...

716
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,350
and wanted to hurt me.

717
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,910
There is no bitter feeling in this house.

718
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,590
You belong here now.

719
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,310
Just as he did.

720
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,460
Thank you.

721
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,510
There doesn't appear to be any proviso should Mrs. Ashley marry again.

722
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,590
That's not likely to happen.

723
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,790
But the point should be covered, should it not?

724
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,240
If you insist.

725
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,400
In case of marriage, her property should revert to you.

726
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,910
Unless, presumably, you predecease her?

727
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,430
Er, yes, yes. Very well.

728
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,350
You are a stickler for these things, aren't you, Mr. Couch?

729
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,430
Well, that's my job, Master Ashley... to stickle.

730
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,870
And you would like this to be ready

731
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,350
and drawn up in legal form by your 25th birthday?

732
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,550
Yes, on the day that the property falls to me.

733
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,960
Absolutely.

734
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,960
You're doing a very generous thing, if I may say so.

735
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,390
Giving everything away the very moment it becomes yours.

736
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,190
Generous, one might say, to the point of...

737
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,230
Rashness?

738
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,310
Will you do as I ask?

739
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,830
Well?

740
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,150
Oh, Philip.

741
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,870
We have a guest.

742
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,310
- What a surprise.  - Such a charming house.

743
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,800
I hope you don't mind, your cousin

744
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,590
has been giving me the grand tour.

745
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,590
And much grander than I had been led to believe.

746
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,140
Benito Casteluccio had brought you an enormous bunch of flowers.

747
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,110
- Cosimo was furious.  - So angry.

748
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,830
I came to wish you good night.

749
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,430
I wish you the same.

750
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,830
He's a very old friend...

751
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,430
and we had a lot to talk about.

752
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,910
Of course.

753
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,840
Well?

754
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,880
Who exactly is Benito Casteluccio?

755
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,040
And why did he bring you flowers?

756
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,900
He was old and very fat...

757
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,030
and his breath smelled of cigars.

758
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,510
I'm sorry. You've been so good.

759
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,110
He's leaving in the morning.

760
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,670
It's excellent, Mr. Couch.

761
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,350
Quite excellent.

762
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,310
Everything's as we discussed.

763
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,190
And you're quite determined

764
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,070
that this is what you want to do,

765
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,510
Master Ashley?

766
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,390
Quite determined?

767
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,310
There is another thing, Mr. Couch, if you don't mind?

768
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,640
- All of them, Master Ashley?  - All of them, Mr. Couch.

769
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,550
Does she have any knowledge of this?

770
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,190
None whatsoever.

771
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,940
And you're quite determined on this course?

772
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,260
Quite.

773
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,390
You're completely infatuated with your cousin, are you not?

774
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,470
I'm just doing what I believe is right.

775
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,830
You realize you could lose everything?

776
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,140
I'm willing to take that risk.

777
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,430
Unless she marries.

778
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,980
- For a third time.  - That's unlikely.

779
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,270
I don't suppose you've thought of asking her yourself?

780
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,710
Why, have you?

781
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,590
Very well.

782
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,990
Let's, er...

783
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,830
- If you, erm...  - Yes.

784
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,910
- Just here.  - Mmm-hmm.

785
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,590
Thank you.

786
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,910
There.

787
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,790
Thank you.

788
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,310
Thank you for your affection for me and for Ambrose.

789
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,200
And your good guardianship over the years.

790
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,760
Guardianship which ends tomorrow.

791
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,480
Tonight, in fact at midnight.

792
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,590
Then happy birthday, Philip,

793
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,510
tonight, at midnight.

794
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,510
I don't suppose you want to see Louise?

795
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,470
- Is she here?  - Yes, I think so.

796
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,630
- I think I should...  - No.

797
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,070
Why don't you ride over tomorrow?

798
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,800
The two of you? Drink my health?

799
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,510
Morning, Joshua!

800
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,030
Master Ashley!

801
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,710
Master Ashley!

802
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,350
I'm all right! I'm all right!

803
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,600
There, boy.

804
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,500
You're lucky the whole cliff didn't fall down on top of you.

805
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,310
- Good boy. There we go.  - I was miles away.

806
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,630
There we go. Hey, steady now.

807
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,630
Thank you. Thank you.

808
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,070
- It's all right.  - Don't you want this one?

809
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,710
Take on a hedge, did we, sir?

810
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,590
Cliff path.

811
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,670
Gorran Head. Damn path fell into the sea beneath me.

812
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,710
Yes. Full moon, spring tide.

813
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,910
Damn near went in after it.

814
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,260
Rachel.

815
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,150
Rachel.

816
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,030
- What is it?  - I've got something for you.

817
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,870
I'm asleep.

818
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,150
Philip.

819
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,360
What are you doing?

820
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,830
You're going to break your neck.

821
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,430
You'll break your neck.

822
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,950
It's all right. I made it.

823
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,990
I'm a little old for Juliet, don't you think?

824
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,670
This...

825
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,510
I want you to read later.

826
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,680
But this...

827
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,720
I want you to have now.

828
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,440
You've gone... You've gone completely mad.

829
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,750
Look, I'm 25. I can do whatever I want.

830
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,030
Wear this.

831
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,110
There's only one thing I want...

832
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,270
er, but I won't ask for it.

833
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,390
- Why not?  - Because you'd slap my face.

834
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,030
Tell me.

835
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,550
I know... I...

836
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:17,750
I know now what I lack.

837
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,510
- Do you?  - Yes.

838
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,740
Are you sure?

839
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,620
I'm sure.

840
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,800
Happy birthday.

841
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,350
John!

842
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:37,950
- John.  - Sir?

843
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,710
- I want a picnic packed.  - Yes, sir.

844
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,110
- Picnic for two, bottle of wine.  - Very good, sir.

845
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,390
Wellington!

846
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,070
Wellington!

847
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,870
- Where is it?  - What, sir?

848
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,070
The carriage.

849
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,190
Don't you know? Er, mistress took it, sir.

850
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,110
Where'd they go?

851
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,630
No idea. Town?

852
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,270
It's a lovely day for your birthday, Master Ashley.

853
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,790
Yes, it is.

854
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,430
A lovely day.

855
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,470
Where have you been?

856
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,230
I've been waiting all morning. Where...

857
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,600
- Do you want some?  - No, thank you.

858
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,270
- Where have you been?  - I've been to Pelyn to see your godfather.

859
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,070
What for?

860
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,990
Well, the wording of your document was a little obscure

861
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,830
and I wanted to be absolutely sure that I knew what it meant.

862
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,270
And is it clear now?

863
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,760
Quite clear.

864
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,860
Put up your veil.

865
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,150
I know your godfather disapproves of me,

866
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,790
but he was very sweet.

867
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,070
We even made a plan to meet up in London.

868
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,880
You don't still intend to go to London, do you?

869
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,360
Why ever not?

870
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,910
Oh, how pretty it is.

871
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,310
- Sit for a moment.  - I'm not tired.

872
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,390
Just for a moment.

873
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,550
I've been sitting in that carriage for hours.

874
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,790
So have I,

875
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,510
sitting like an idiot at the front door waiting for you to come back.

876
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,080
There.

877
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,120
This was my plan...

878
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,950
which you have spoilt...

879
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,470
by lunching with the dull old Kendalls.

880
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,070
I rather thought it might be.

881
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,430
Let me get up.

882
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,550
Here.

883
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,960
Thank you.

884
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,240
If I'd known I was coming into a fortune,

885
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,960
I would have given you a considerably larger pearl.

886
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,670
It's lovely. Thank you.

887
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,430
Shall we go?

888
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,870
Mistress's compliments.

889
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,510
What is it?

890
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,910
Twig soup.

891
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,710
Special brew, she says. Birthday brew.

892
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,990
Says you've got to drink the lot.

893
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,430
And then he proceeded

894
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,840
to dance around the house,

895
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,990
up and down the stairs, up and down,

896
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,270
and, really,

897
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,630
it was the oddest jig you've ever seen.

898
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,840
Philip.

899
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,510
- Philip?  - Philip. Philip.

900
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,230
To you.

901
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:34,590
Long life and happiness.

902
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,830
- To Philip.  - To you.

903
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,140
I, er...

904
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,950
I too have a toast to make, erm, tonight.

905
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,830
Since this morning I have been...

906
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,590
the happiest of men.

907
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,070
And I want you, my godfather,

908
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,950
and you, dear, dear Louise,

909
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,870
to drink to my happiness.

910
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,910
And the reason for such happiness...

911
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,110
the woman to be my wife.

912
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,710
Rachel.

913
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,910
My darling.

914
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,710
Have you gone out of your mind?

915
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,990
Of course not.

916
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,950
Please.

917
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,310
I think that the birthday excitement has gone to Philip's head,

918
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,230
and I think that we should retire to the next room.

919
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,990
I have known shame in my life.

920
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,720
Terrible shame...

921
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,230
but this is the worst.

922
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,830
You weren't ashamed last night.

923
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,630
You weren't ashamed this afternoon.

924
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,150
Ashamed of what?

925
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,560
Of... of...

926
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,230
Why should I be ashamed of that?

927
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,950
You asked me... You asked me what it was that I lacked,

928
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,870
and I said the only thing that I lacked...

929
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,470
Oh, my god.

930
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,110
Was...

931
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,630
Was...

932
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,270
Was you.

933
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,190
No. Oh, god.

934
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,470
- Didn't you enjoy it?  - Well, didn't you?

935
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,550
You know I did.

936
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,870
Good. I wanted you to enjoy it.

937
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,990
- I wanted to thank you.  - For what?

938
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,750
For what? For everything.

939
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,710
For... For being so kind to me,

940
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,470
for the jewels.

941
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,670
What did you... did you...

942
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,430
Did you think you had bought me?

943
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,110
Wait. Wait. Please, please, please.

944
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,660
- Kiss me, please.  - Let go of my arm.

945
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,160
Kiss me, please. Just kiss me.

946
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,230
- Let go of my arm.  - Kiss me.

947
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,830
- Kiss me, please.  - Let go of me.

948
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,430
I've been worried about you for so long.

949
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,790
Since before Christmas.

950
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,070
You know nothing about her.

951
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,470
Or is it you who know nothing?

952
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,510
It's no use.

953
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,430
I'm fond of you and you of me,

954
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,070
but if we keep on talking,

955
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,830
we'll end up hating each other.

956
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,790
Do you love her so very much?

957
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,710
Don't think I don't know how much of a fool I must appear to you.

958
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,950
I asked her to marry me.

959
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,950
I shall continue to ask her.

960
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,510
When exactly did you ask her?

961
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,350
The moment I came of age. Yesterday.

962
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,240
- My god, yesterday.  - What did she say?

963
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,040
I thought she said yes, but...

964
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,190
In fact, she meant no.

965
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,790
Was this before or after she read the document?

966
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,950
Before. She read it the morning after.

967
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,550
And wasted no time in driving over to see us.

968
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,390
She said she didn't fully understand it.

969
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,310
Well, she understood it pretty damn well by the time she left.

970
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,230
We stood on the steps in the sunshine

971
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,830
waiting for her carriage

972
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,830
and my father said to her,

973
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,990
"The marriage clause may strike you as a little hard.

974
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,150
You must remain a widow if you want to keep your fortune."

975
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,670
And what did she... What did she say?

976
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,990
She just smiled and put on her gloves

977
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,910
and said, "That suits me very well."

978
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,110
That clause is to protect the estate.

979
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,030
If she were my wife... of course it wouldn't apply.

980
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,950
No. No, you're wrong.

981
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,870
If she marries you, or anyone else,

982
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,990
then everything, the house, everything, reverts to you.

983
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,510
But I'd share everything with her,

984
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,590
every penny.

985
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,030
She knows that.

986
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,590
A wife can't send money out of the country.

987
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,550
A wife would have to live here,

988
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,950
in England, with her husband.

989
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,630
- The peg moves forward.  - Moves forward two points.

990
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,190
- And play.  - Oh, don't we say "muggins"?

991
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,840
- Muggins. Muggins. Muggins.  - Muggins.

992
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,190
Hello, Philip.

993
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,190
I invited Mary Pascoe to stay in the house with me,

994
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,230
as my companion.

995
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,270
I do hope you approve.

996
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,820
Do you play? It's cribbage.

997
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,080
- Can I speak to you?  - Yes.

998
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,880
- I can teach you if you like.  - Alone.

999
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,630
Well, anything you want to say can be said in front of Mary.

1000
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,760
I don't want to be in the way. Let me go into my room.

1001
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,030
Leave the door open, Mary, so you may hear me if I need you.

1002
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,110
Yes, certainly, Mrs. Ashley.

1003
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,750
- Don't do that.  - Do what?

1004
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,870
Don't close the door.

1005
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,030
After last night, I cannot be alone with you.

1006
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,310
Please don't do this.

1007
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,310
I don't feel safe with you.

1008
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,230
I beg you.

1009
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,750
Goodness me. If I were you,

1010
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,270
I would get Dr. Smalls to have a look at that.

1011
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,590
Thank god.

1012
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,120
You're back.

1013
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,860
There.

1014
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,990
- Rachel...  - Don't speak.

1015
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,640
Here.

1016
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,150
How long was I out?

1017
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,630
Five days.

1018
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:08,910
And the Pascoe girl?

1019
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,750
Sent packing.

1020
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,310
Keep still. Keep still.

1021
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,240
Glad to see

1022
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,910
Wellington's cutting back the laburnum.

1023
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,550
What's that?

1024
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,350
Well, if a horse gets a mouthful of that,

1025
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,430
it would kill them.

1026
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,790
Oh, yes. You had one in Italy.

1027
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,510
Did I?

1028
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,670
By the fountain in a pot. Do you remember?

1029
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,950
Did I?

1030
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,620
Well, I can't be expected to remember everything.

1031
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,710
Here.

1032
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,150
Drink.

1033
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,510
Where do you go?

1034
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,310
Where?

1035
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,590
Are you worried I'll tire the horses?

1036
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,230
No. No.

1037
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,950
I'm worried you're about to leave.

1038
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,640
Are you leaving me?

1039
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,910
You should have left me to die.

1040
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,270
Don't.

1041
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,230
Soon none of this will seem quite so bad.

1042
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,990
You belong here.

1043
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,350
In a little while you'll be strong again

1044
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,710
and everything will be just as it was before I came.

1045
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,270
You are at the beginning of everything.

1046
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,990
A boy.

1047
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,830
How can I live with a boy?

1048
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,350
However lovely.

1049
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,830
Hmm?

1050
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,990
A glorious puppy...

1051
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,920
wandering around, miserable and wet-nosed,

1052
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,110
looking for its mother.

1053
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,870
Drink.

1054
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,520
Drink.

1055
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,390
"She's going through all the money like water,

1056
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,790
grasping, greedy for everything,

1057
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,230
but clever too, cunning.

1058
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:59,750
It's a disease. She can't help herself.

1059
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,300
She'll take every single penny.

1060
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,910
She'll ruin me.

1061
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,230
She'll ruin us. She'll ruin everything."

1062
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,230
What is that?

1063
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:16,510
Nothing.

1064
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,030
What was it?

1065
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,510
Nothing. It was...

1066
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,070
Why is he here?

1067
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,910
- Because I asked him.  - Why?

1068
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,430
Why not? I needed advice.

1069
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,470
- What for?  - Not your business.

1070
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,430
How long have you been lying to me?

1071
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,590
You hate him.

1072
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:10,030
If I'd told you he was here, it would have made you sick again.

1073
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,310
Send him away. Send him away!

1074
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,270
- Why don't I bring him here?  - Are you mad?

1075
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,950
He can stay here as my protector.

1076
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,710
- He can stay in my bedroom.  - You wouldn't dare.

1077
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,950
Why not? Why not?

1078
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,350
Why shouldn't I have a life of my own

1079
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,950
and make a life for myself and do as I please?

1080
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:34,030
This house is mine, after all, isn't it?

1081
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,270
- Isn't it mine?  - God!

1082
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:41,710
Get away from me. Stay away from me!

1083
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,990
Or I will call the servants. You stay away.

1084
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,390
Do you want to be shamed in front of the servants?

1085
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,150
Do you?

1086
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:07,230
Go on.

1087
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,710
Call for them.

1088
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,470
For all of them.

1089
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,750
Go on.

1090
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,830
Tell them what's happened here between us.

1091
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:23,920
All of it.

1092
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:31,430
Put an end to it.

1093
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,110
I'm too tired.

1094
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,600
I'm too tired to fight.

1095
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:48,870
I can't do this again.

1096
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,110
I can't.

1097
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,960
All of this.

1098
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:07,310
Even... Even the hands at my throat.

1099
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,150
I can't.

1100
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:17,230
I can't do it all again.

1101
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,270
I was very grateful

1102
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:44,110
for Master Ambrose's coat, Master Ashley,

1103
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,520
very grateful.

1104
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,750
And I had never put it on before yesterday.

1105
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,430
It's too good for me, I thought.

1106
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:53,430
I was very grateful for it, Master Ashley, very grateful.

1107
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,550
And I put my hand in the pocket

1108
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:57,430
and there it was, Master Ashley, sir,

1109
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,740
there it was.

1110
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,830
Still sealed. Still sealed.

1111
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,080
"You are the only person

1112
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,480
in the world I can trust.

1113
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,550
Drop everything. Come out to me.

1114
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,630
Only come straightaway.

1115
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,190
I fear for my life.

1116
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,030
The headaches, the sickness, the fever,

1117
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,990
suddenly I understand.

1118
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,030
The bitter potions, poisoning me.

1119
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,350
All this time she's been poisoning me."

1120
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,070
I've been a fool.

1121
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,110
In Florence,

1122
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,550
I used to brew the tisana in the salotto

1123
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,550
and then let it stand for a while.

1124
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,590
And then we would go out into the little courtyard,

1125
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:44,030
if it wasn't too hot, and sit,

1126
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,310
and I would turn on the fountain

1127
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,630
and we would sip the tisana.

1128
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,620
Ambrose would sit there for hours.

1129
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,200
Here.

1130
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,870
Oh, no, not that one. That's Philip's.

1131
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,990
Thank you.

1132
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,750
- Here.  - No, thank you.

1133
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,230
Oh, but this is a special batch.

1134
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,470
I've made it double strength.

1135
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,470
Well, then, you drink it for me.

1136
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,310
What do you think?

1137
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,670
Hmm.

1138
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:22,160
It's, erm...

1139
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,070
It's very interesting.

1140
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,150
I think it might take me a while to fall in love with it.

1141
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,830
Who'll come riding with me?

1142
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,950
Oh, we could take the carriage,

1143
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,260
if you prefer.

1144
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,310
You go.

1145
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,430
Louise and I have some business to discuss.

1146
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,110
You do?

1147
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,350
What a waste, on a day like this.

1148
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,190
Very well. I shall go on my own.

1149
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,750
I won't be long. Finish your tea.

1150
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,350
Where are you off to?

1151
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:23,310
I don't know. Up Barton Hill, perhaps,

1152
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,720
or into the woods.

1153
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:27,190
Do you think the bluebells are still there?

1154
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,110
The bluebells are long gone, I'm afraid.

1155
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,150
- You might try the cliff path.  - Yes, that's an idea.

1156
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,750
There are seal pups this time of year off Gorran Head.

1157
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,190
You're looking better.

1158
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,780
You look...

1159
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:48,910
beautiful.

1160
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,110
I'm sorry.

1161
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,910
What are we looking for?

1162
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,950
Laburnum seeds, letters. I don't know.

1163
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,710
She poisoned Ambrose and now she's poisoning me.

1164
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,020
Don't you see?

1165
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,510
It's Couch. It's the lawyer.

1166
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,030
"We thank you for the return of the jewels,

1167
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:32,470
which according to your instruction will remain with us

1168
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,390
until your heir, Philip Ashley, may take possession of them."

1169
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,750
Oh, so...

1170
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,390
So she's giving them back.

1171
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,990
The jewelry, she's giving it back.

1172
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,630
Keep looking.

1173
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:50,230
Philip, I don't know what we're looking for anymore.

1174
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,960
- Shouldn't we just...  - Keep looking, please!

1175
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,160
Here, it's in Italian. It's Rainaldi, it must be.

1176
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,670
Is it him?

1177
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,510
It's signed Enrico. Is that right?

1178
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:09,820
Yes, that's him, yes.

1179
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,350
Well, translate it for me, please.

1180
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,660
"Dearest Rachel,

1181
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:13,950
on second thoughts,

1182
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,440
if you really cannot bring yourself

1183
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,950
to leave the boy behind,

1184
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:21,110
bring him with you.

1185
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,270
I still don't think it's a good idea,

1186
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,270
but, then again, Italy and some sunshine

1187
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,950
may be the making of him."

1188
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,470
Is that it?

1189
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,560
Philip, inquiries were made. My father...

1190
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,630
What inquiries?

1191
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,110
In matters of the heart, it seems that...

1192
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:55,830
Enrico Rainaldi is more Greek than he is Italian.

1193
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,630
He likes boys, Philip.

1194
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,470
Wellington!

1195
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,310
- I'll get a saddle!  - Damn the saddle!

1196
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,150
Who's to blame?

1197
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,470
I was an orphan.

1198
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,790
Ambrose took me in.

1199
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:42,630
He was my cousin,

1200
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,990
but I loved him like a father.

1201
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,790
Now I'm a father.

1202
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:55,110
What can I teach them?

1203
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,910
What can I tell them?

1204
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:02,430
Headaches blind me.

1205
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,320
Was she?

1206
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,360
Did she?

1207
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,030
Didn't she?

1208
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,950
Rachel, my torment.
