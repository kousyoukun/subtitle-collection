2
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,660
Bells will ring
at the New York Stock Exchange

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,445
for another day, on this March 18th.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,329
Okay, here we go. Are you listening?

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,580
Are you paying attention out there?

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,500
Good. Because it's about to get complicated,

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,922
so I'm gonna start out slow
and make it nice and simple for you.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,364
You don't have a clue where your money is.

9
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,060
See, once upon a time,

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,100
you could walk into your bank,
and they'd open a vault

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,362
and point to a gold brick.

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,540
Not anymore.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,420
Your money, that thing that
you bust your ass for,

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,060
it's nothing more
than a few photons of energy

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,960
traveling through a massive
network of fiber optic cables.

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,900
Why'd we do it?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,207
We did it to make it go faster.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,206
Because your money better be fast.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,564
Faster than the other guy's.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,740
But if you want faster markets
with faster trades,

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,161
faster profits, faster everything,

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,084
sometimes you're gonna blow a tire.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,580
And that is exactly what happened yesterday

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,127
at 1:07 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,380
After heavy after-hours trading,
Ibis's stock price took an historic $67...

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,687
...run by high-frequency
trading pioneer Walt Camby,

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,580
disclosed that an algorithm managing
its portfolio suddenly went haywire.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,500
The trading algorithm seems to have
experienced an unexplained anomaly.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,020
A glitch.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,020
Shares of Ibis Clear Capital
getting killed this morning.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,620
...net loss of over $800 million.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,460
- It has gone haywire.
- An algorithm...

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,540
- ...glitch...
- ...a glitch...

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,900
- ...glitch!
- A glitch.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,460
Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday,

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,420
but if you've been paying attention to me
for the past 16 months,

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,490
Walt Camby has made you a lot of money.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,605
But if you were late to the party,
I'm not going to sugarcoat it,

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,969
you got your ass smacked yesterday.

40
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,369
But this is only the first round.
Because this, my friend, is an opportunity.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,524
So here's what you're gonna do.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,300
You're gonna stop whining,
and you're gonna get back in the ring

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,129
because this stock is coming back.

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,244
You know what that means?

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,410
Let's go throw some punches.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,404
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,780
What do you mean he's ordained?

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,850
No, on a plane, Lee. A plane.

49
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
All right. That makes more sense.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,780
Wait, Walt Camby's on a plane?

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,645
Can you pick up the pace, please?
It's like dealing with my grandmother.

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,761
Come on, I'm not having a conversation
with you through the goddamn door.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,300
All right, I'll leave it open next time.

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,700
Wait, now, why the hell would Walt cancel?
He called me from Geneva yesterday.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,180
I don't know. He's on a plane.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,340
And how are we
just finding out about it now?

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,441
That is a great question.

58
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,300
You can ask him
the next time you talk to him.

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,220
Here. First one's a yes. Second one's a no.

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,980
Third one's just a signature.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,740
- Ten minutes, Mr. Gates.
- All right.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,860
- Thanks, Gen.
- Yep.

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,660
The fill-in's name is Diane Lester.
They're setting up her remote feed now.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,940
- Who the hell is Diane Lester?
- She is the Chief Communications Officer.

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,042
She wrote all the talking points anyway,
so should be fine.

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,700
When am I getting
the revisions for the opening?

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,660
We're making some changes on it.
Anybody seen Ron?

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,460
Might I get those before the show
or after the show?

69
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,700
You know the drill.
You just point the camera in my direction,

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,801
and we'll figure it out together.

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,500
It always sounds so simple
and yet so moronic.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,100
All right. Look out, fellas. Here we come.

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,900
Edgar Rosenthal's office called.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,740
- He can't make dinner tonight.
- Thank Christ.

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,740
Dinner at the nursing home with my nan
is more exciting than dinner with that guy.

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,220
This is the 7th reschedule.
So can I just move it to the TBD list?

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,060
Wait a minute, it's the 7th time
he's rescheduled on me?

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes, that's correct.

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,330
That's ridiculous.
I'm calling him on his cell.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,900
Well, his office said that he's in a meeting.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,844
- Hey, Freddy, nice call on the yen yesterday.
- Eat a dick, Lee.

82
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,980
Lee, this is Diane Lester.

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,500
Alan, can you bring the boom in
for me, please?

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,700
Ed! It's Lee Iacocca.

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,820
Listen, I changed my mind
on this whole retirement thing.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,082
Turns out I want your job after all.

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,606
Yeah, it's Gates.

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,288
Okay. All right, I'll talk to you later.

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,980
All right.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,500
So no dinner.

91
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,365
Lee. Follow the noise. Diane Lester.

92
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,940
- Memo of talking points.
- Hello? Hello?

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,180
You guys at Ibis can't do anything
right these days, can you?

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,620
Look, I'm really sorry to put you
in this situation, Lee.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,060
I fit was something we could control,
believe me, we would.

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,860
I'm not the enemy here, Diane.
I'm friendly fire.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,500
We know that.
If you read my talking points...

98
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,780
Guy's a billionaire. He owns how many jets?

99
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,620
- ...Walt has already addressed the glitch...
- Five minutes!

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,460
'Cause commercial flights, they get delayed,

101
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,608
but private ones,
they get to do whatever the hell they want.

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,220
- Ron! Where's Ron?
- I'm not sure. But here's a list of dinners...

103
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,740
We'll be with you in less than five, Diane.

104
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,500
Look at that. I wouldn't invite
any of those people to an audit.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,620
Ron!

106
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,460
Ron. There you are.
Is that my Canadian commodities data?

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,940
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

108
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,500
Sorry, I just ran all the way back
from the Village.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,300
I had a meeting with Tony Biscano
at Licem Pharmaceutical.

110
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,640
Lee, I'll be in your ear.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,082
He gave me this.

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,082
- What is it?
- It's erectile cream.

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,500
Tony Biscano of Licem
gave you erectile cream?

114
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,580
Yeah.

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,740
I guess I wasn't aware of the exact nature
of your relationship.

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,180
They've been testing this thing
for over a year

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,940
and the approval from the FDA
finally came in last night.

118
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,060
They're sending out a press release...

119
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,340
- And it works?
- Apparently, yeah. Pretty damn well.

120
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,140
- Have you tried it?
- I just got it, 30 minutes ago.

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,340
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- You want me to...

122
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,966
We're on in five minutes, aren't we?
Put it on!

123
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,620
Mr. Gates, you need this.
Don't forget your talking points.

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,609
Yeah, yeah. Put it on my desk.

125
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,380
Okay, where is Diane Lester?

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,687
She's all checked in on remote six.

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,180
Who writes this shit?

128
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,860
- Is the graphics package loaded?
- Last one is just coming in.

129
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,100
Great.

130
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,100
We are still working off the rehearsal script
for the opening, guys.

131
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,340
But he didn't even stick
to the rehearsal script at rehearsal.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,020
- So, about dinner... Did you...
- Okay, you wore me down.

133
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,220
I'm sorry?

134
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,060
I'll go to dinner with you.
We'll go to Scalinatella's, let's say 9:30?

135
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,020
I still have a boyfriend, Lee.
Just like I did yesterday.

136
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,380
Yeah, he's still a bartender in Hoboken,
like he was yesterday.

137
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,700
- Will this work, boss?
- This is a stuffed parrot.

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,220
I said I wanted a live pigeon.

139
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,300
Patty, God damn it.

140
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,540
We don't have a live pigeon.

141
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,460
- Admit it. You're gonna miss this.
- You can't find a live pigeon?

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm sure there are plenty of
emotionally stunted 7-year-olds

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,180
hosting TV shows across the street.
Thank you.

144
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,100
Cover yourself...
Roll with yourself in breadcrumbs

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,260
and bring a fucking bird up here.

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,580
Jim, can you punch Diane
up on the preview for me, please?

147
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,900
Sure. There she is.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,180
Patty? Patty?

149
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,409
- Hi, Diane, can you hear me?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,900
Lee has read the talking points, right?

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,180
Because I'm in a tough position here,

152
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,300
and I just want to make sure
that he sticks to the script.

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,420
He will. You know us, Diane.
We don't do "gotcha" journalism here.

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,807
Hell, we don't do journalism, period.

155
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,924
Scream one is up.

156
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,683
Check. Check. Check.

157
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,260
Money... Money... Money Monster.

158
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,521
About time.

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,081
All right, I'm ready.

160
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,100
So, here's a novel idea.

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,044
How about you just pick up
some takeout on your way home.

162
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,900
God, stop. I'm getting depressed.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,731
Get into your most comfortable
pair of pajamas.

164
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,540
No, no, no. This isn't really
a Friday night for you, is it? Can't be.

165
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,700
Curl right up in front of the TV?

166
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,647
It's 'cause the idea of television and
pajamas and takeout, good God, it's like...

167
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,260
You get a pool cue, and I want you to
sharpen it down to a fine point.

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,011
And I want you to shove it
straight through my eye.

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,300
- Hold on a sec, Lee.
- Right into my brain.

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,060
You're killing me here, Lenny.
Check your mark, please.

171
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,300
You know what?
I drifted and I forgot to lock.

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,561
Balls.

173
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,900
That's it.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,322
I would rather you do that
than sitting at home in my underwear

175
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,082
watching "Suck-My-QVC."

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,340
Look at the new guy.

177
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,220
Where's Leroy? Finally canned his ass.

178
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,321
One minute to air.

179
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,980
One minute. Clear the stage, please.

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,420
Patty, honest answer.

181
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,660
How many nights a week
do you eat dinner in your pajamas?

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,820
Like, on average, over the course
of my life? Or just since James left?

183
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,180
Listen, listen.

184
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,660
Because I haven't eaten dinner alone
since the '90s. That's hand to God.

185
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,460
Well, that's just awful.
That just makes me feel sorry for you.

186
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,940
Why do you feel sorry for me?

187
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,089
Hang on, Patty. Just one second.
Ron, you walking hard or what?

188
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,860
This stuff is incredible.

189
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,700
I'm talking zero to 60 in,
like, 20 seconds flat.

190
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,020
Good, so it's a buy, then.

191
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,540
All right. Put it away and find me
a better lead for next week's show.

192
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,620
Put it away?

193
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,780
- Lee, necklace.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

194
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,860
Thirty seconds till air. Thirty seconds.

195
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,180
Where's my hat?

196
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,660
Can we turn down the contrast
on her a little bit, please?

197
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,761
Sure.

198
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,540
- How's that?
- That's better. Thank you.

199
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,801
- Fifteen seconds.
- Okay.

200
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,247
Here we go. Good luck, everybody.

201
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,762
- Open on VT 16.
- Ten, nine...

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,962
- Coming out of the opening to camera 3.
- ...eight, seven...

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,380
Six,

204
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,540
five,

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,580
four,

206
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,380
three, two,

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,448
- one.
- Track rollup.

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,725
Here he is,
the wizard of Wall Street himself, Lee Gates.

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,285
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

210
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,480
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

211
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,460
At the welcome mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash

212
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,881
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'...

213
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,646
Thank you very much.
The name is Lee Gates.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,700
The show is Money Monster,

215
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,006
the day is Friday,

216
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,500
and the Dow has dropped a seismic
seven points this morning.

217
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
- Ready scream one.
- So what does that mean for the market...

218
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,647
Should you...

219
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,460
Ready cheer three.

220
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,925
- ...or should you...
- Roll.

221
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,780
And the answer is,
who cares about the Dow?

222
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,340
It's a measly 30 companies.

223
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,841
So why do you people
keep paying attention to it?

224
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,540
Probably because
our network insists on tracking it.

225
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,980
- Right here at the bottom of the screen...
- Not sticking to the script.

226
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,460
...in large font all day.

227
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,140
- Why does he keep talking?
- And why do they do that?

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,780
Sacajawea, Lee.

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,660
Because you people keep paying
so much attention to it.

230
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,020
Sacajawea.

231
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,168
- And the circle just keeps on turning.
- Shut up.

232
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,140
Thank you.

233
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,686
So let's try to ignore it.
Let's try to ignore it for one day.

234
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,322
One day, and talk about the thing
that everybody else is talking about.

235
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,180
Ibis Clear Capital is down another quarter
to $8.40,

236
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,931
but rather than grabbing the third rail

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,020
and losing control of our bowels,

238
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,460
we here at Money Monster like to go...

239
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,300
Straight to the Source!

240
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,481
Straight to the source.

241
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,980
As it turns out, Walt Camby is
35,000 feet in the air right now,

242
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,811
but we have somebody
far prettier right here at sea level.

243
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,540
It's his right-hand gal, Diane...

244
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,180
- It's Lester.
- Lester.

245
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,780
Is gonna be on the show
in a little while to explain

246
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,660
not only what went wrong last week,

247
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,420
but, more importantly,
what they're gonna do to fix it.

248
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,841
But first,
let's talk market Movers and Shakers.

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,340
Jim, cue clip package two and three
in case he skips one.

250
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,500
Two and three?

251
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,762
You're wondering,
"Should I sell? Should I unload?"

252
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,180
You know what I'm gonna say to you.

253
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,281
Roll balls.

254
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,285
Grow some balls, man! Man up!

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,180
Good one.

256
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,090
Man up! Lenny, let me hear you say it.

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,201
Lenny, let me hear it.

258
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,060
Look at these numbers. See these?

259
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,180
These are the stock prices
over the last three months.

260
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,580
See these drops?

261
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,700
Get used to it. It's just the way
the market works these days.

262
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,420
Look at this. $3.50 here.
Almost five bucks there.

263
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,140
If you panicked here, you would have sold...

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,980
- Who's that guy?
- Who's what guy?

265
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,321
- ...you whiners, you chickens.
- Camera 2.

266
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,860
You know what I'm gonna tell you to do.

267
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,645
Mark, can you pan over?
Do you see that guy?

268
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,540
We're talking about 89% return. Even the
Teamsters get excited about these numbers.

269
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,007
Somebody didn't tell me something.

270
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,491
Looks like a delivery guy.

271
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,780
Say it. I'm not gonna move until you say it.

272
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,540
- Balls.
- Balls!

273
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,220
There it is! Just under the wire.

274
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,041
All right. Now, for the rest of you,
you know what that means.

275
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,580
It's time for today's
"Can't Miss Stock Tip of the Millennium."

276
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,140
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium.

277
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,900
Telecommunications.
Forget the top-rated stocks.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,660
Well, here he comes.

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,242
Okay, Mark, stay with this guy.
I don't know who he is.

280
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,380
Alan, there's no chance he's miked,
so just boom him in.

281
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,481
Let's see what happens.

282
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,180
Hopefully you've been listening
to our little birdy.

283
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,100
Where's that stupid parrot?

284
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,201
You got a delivery?

285
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,124
- Don't move.
- What the hell?

286
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,691
Is this a union thing?

287
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,121
Jesus!

288
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,611
Cut the feed.

289
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,846
Turn those cameras back on!

290
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,288
- Turn those cameras back on!
- Jesus Christ!

291
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,486
Whoever's in there,
turn those cameras back on, right now!

292
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,460
- I can't. Once I turn them off...
- You're lying!

293
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,860
Turn the cameras back on
or I'm gonna shoot him in his head!

294
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,980
Turn the cameras on, Patty! Turn them on!

295
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,100
Patty?

296
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,167
Patty!

297
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,580
All right, I'm gonna count to three,

298
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,125
- then I swear to God...
- Do something!

299
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,340
- ...I'm pulling this trigger. One...
- Patty!

300
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,771
Patty, what do you want me to do?

301
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,245
- Turn them on, Patty!
- Two...

302
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,845
- Patty!
- Three!

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,729
- What do you want me to do?
- Put it up.

304
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,925
Are we live?

305
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,044
Yeah, we're live.

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,540
All right, turn the cameras off again

307
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,140
I'm gonna shoot him in his head.
You hear me?

308
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,300
Everybody understands.

309
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,940
- Don't try any tricks with the monitors.
- Call security.

310
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,140
I got the whole broadcast here on my phone.

311
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,722
If I see anything other than us,
I'm gonna shoot him in his head, all right?

312
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,180
- Do you understand me?
- Everybody understands you.

313
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,140
Everybody understands.
We stay on the air. All right.

314
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,368
- We're staying on the air.
- Good.

315
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,481
Good.

316
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,740
No, wait.

317
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,887
He's not picking up.

318
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,260
- Okay.
- Pick a box.

319
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,580
What do you mean?

320
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,500
- I said, "Pick a box."
- What happens if I pick the wrong box?

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,660
I said pick one!

322
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,180
- I'm not picking a fucking box!
- Did he say "fucking" on air?

323
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,180
Are you fucking kidding?
Call fucking security!

324
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,660
Hi, there's a guy with a gun in studio 3.

325
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,500
It sounds like a real cute stunt today.

326
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,420
Would you turn on the goddamn TV?
It's not a stunt this time.

327
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,000
- I need help. Help me, help me.
- Jesus!

328
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,860
Stupid son of a bitch.

329
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,964
Pick a goddamn box, Lee. Come on!

330
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,211
Come on, Lee.

331
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,451
Do it!

332
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,805
That's right. Open it up.

333
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,291
Jesus Christ.

334
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,720
Now, pick it up.

335
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,406
Yep. Take it out.

336
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,324
- Now put it on.
- How do I know it won't blow up?

337
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,442
'Cause I have the detonator. All right?

338
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,164
If my thumb comes off this trigger,
then we all explode.

339
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,007
- What if your thumb gets tired?
- You better hope it doesn't.

340
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,651
Now put it on.

341
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,440
Quickly!

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,980
- Okay, listen up, everybody.
- Put it on.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,244
If you're not manning a camera
or a boom, get out right now.

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,980
Stop what you're doing.

345
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,580
If you're not core-one control room,
get going.

346
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,900
Don't look up. Just go.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,161
Right now.

348
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,205
Button it up.

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,167
Good.

350
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,971
Sit down.

351
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,170
Something's wrong.

352
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,820
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe, Lee.

353
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,380
I can't catch my breath.

354
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,980
Just stay calm. Don't panic. You can breathe.

355
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,100
I'm having a heart attack.

356
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,043
- Do I look stupid to you?
- You are not having a heart attack.

357
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,961
- Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

358
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,380
- Just breathe.
- Oh, God.

359
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,700
Patty, I'm gonna fucking die.

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,380
- No, you're not.
- You're not gonna die, dipshit. Not yet.

361
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,131
- Fuck you! I'm having a fucking heart attack.
- You're not having a heart attack.

362
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,460
- You're having a panic attack.
- How do you know?

363
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,564
'Cause it happens to me all the time.
Here, drink some water.

364
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,970
That's not water.

365
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,562
Lee, I want you to hear my voice.
I'm right here.

366
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,411
Just keep breathing.

367
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,540
Shots have been fired at FNN

368
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,900
- on the set of Money Monster with Lee Gates.
- Bring it here.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,020
An intruder found his way into the studio...

370
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,681
Turn on FNN, Money Monster.
Lee Gates has been taken hostage.

371
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,401
Shit.

372
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,250
- Shut those doors!
- Okay. Okay.

373
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,250
I see you.

374
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,780
Hey! Get out of there!
Nobody goes in the booth, all right?

375
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,420
Nobody's leaving from here on out.

376
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,820
Anybody tries anything stupid,

377
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,524
and I start shooting.

378
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,808
All right? I'm in charge.

379
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,166
You! Stay still. Stop fucking moving.

380
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,140
I got something I wanna say.

381
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,980
- Patty, what do you want me to do?
- Wanna make sure I get time to say it.

382
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,127
Follow him.

383
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,561
All right.

384
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,042
I want everyone to know something.

385
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,562
I might be the one with the gun here,

386
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,724
but I'm not the real criminal.
It's people like these guys!

387
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,169
They're stealing everything from us
and they're getting away with it, too.

388
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,801
Nobody's asking how. Nobody's asking why.

389
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,481
I didn't steal anything from you.

390
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,889
Be quiet, Lee.

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,321
You got to open your eyes out there.

392
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,641
It's not like the government's no help.

393
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,900
How they just look the other way,
since after they're done stealing our money,

394
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,685
they barely even have to pay any taxes on it!

395
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,847
I'm telling you, it's rigged.
The whole goddamn thing.

396
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,140
They're stealing
the country out from under us.

397
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,660
Not the Muslims. Not the Chinese. Them.

398
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,685
- Let me ask you this...
- Shut up, Lee! Shut the fuck up!

399
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,921
Shut up!

400
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,620
I came here to talk! Shut up for two minutes.

401
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,721
All right. Okay.

402
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,444
Jesus Christ.

403
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,884
It's all fixed.

404
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,602
They like how the math adds up,
so they got to keep rewriting the equation.

405
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,140
Which means, the one time you finally
get a little extra money,

406
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,481
you try and be smart about it,
you turn on the TV.

407
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,044
That's how they fucking take it.

408
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,644
They take it so fast
they don't even have to explain it!

409
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,963
They literally own the airwaves.

410
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,966
They literally control the information.
But not today.

411
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,484
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything, Lee.

412
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,700
This has everything to do
with the both of you.

413
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,326
That's why I'm here. Don't you understand?

414
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,370
Two boxes.

415
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,644
Two assholes.

416
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,620
Two?

417
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,881
Two.

418
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,607
You didn't just come here for me.

419
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,571
This is about Ibis.

420
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,980
- Goddamn right, this is about Ibis.
- Okay, I get it.

421
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,300
Turn that camera off.

422
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,606
Turn the camera off.

423
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,860
You lost a lot of money.

424
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,740
You went on TV. You said it was safe.

425
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,444
Four weeks ago. You stood right there.

426
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,001
This is what you did. "Let's get into this."

427
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,300
- "Ibis! Safer than a savings account!"
- I didn't say that.

428
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,140
"Home run after home run... Walt Camby!"

429
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,380
- I didn't do that!
- Don't fucking lie, Lee! That's what you said.

430
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,100
I did recommend it, but I never said
it was safer than a savings account.

431
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,420
You want to bet? Come on, let's bet.

432
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,740
You said it was safer
than my savings account.

433
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,683
- I would never say it.
- Come on. Let's bet.

434
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,580
March the 6th, it was
Stock Pick of the Millennium. March the 6th.

435
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,260
I make a stock pick every single day.
That's a fucking joke.

436
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,180
You got the tapes back there, right?

437
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,220
Fuck off.

438
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,300
Find it.

439
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,449
- March the 6th show.
- We do five shows a week.

440
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,561
Find them!

441
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,371
How many people are inside?

442
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,724
A floor manager, a sound engineer,

443
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,281
and three cameramen on the main floor.

444
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,820
And the director, Patty Fenn.

445
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,820
And five tech guys
in the enclosed control room.

446
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay, ESU will be here momentarily.

447
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,780
So, we're gonna need
schematics on the building.

448
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,180
Catwalks, exits, entrances,
the whole shebang.

449
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,281
Got it.

450
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,926
Vasquez?

451
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,060
If that's Semtex, it's enough
for a fireball 50-feet from center.

452
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,924
I got a line to the control room yet?

453
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,100
Evacuate the rest of the building.
Once it's swept, nobody in or out.

454
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,690
Come on. Let's go.

455
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,060
Shuttle, shuttle, shuttle.

456
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,020
Diversify, diversify, diversify.

457
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,282
Freeze. There it is. Okay, we've got it.

458
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,649
- Roll it, Jim.
- Rolling.

459
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,402
There it is! That's it.
Let's settle this right now.

460
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,620
The name is Lee Gates.
The show is Money Monster.

461
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,540
The day is Friday, March 6th.
Let's get right to it.

462
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,580
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium!

463
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,968
Let's see what old
lucky one-arm has for us today.

464
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,900
Ibis Clear Capital.

465
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,526
I know, I've talked this one up before,
but what can I tell you?

466
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,485
I'm in love.

467
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,100
This is Ibis's stock
since it went public 11 months ago.

468
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,568
Look at those curves. So voluptuous.

469
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,529
So full-figured!

470
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,324
I'm genuinely attracted to it.

471
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,700
Not sexually so much,

472
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,060
although after half a dozen vodka tonics I
could talk myself into pretty much anything.

473
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,529
No. I am in love with this intellectually.

474
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,420
Because Ibis is run
by a man named Walt Camby.

475
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,420
Walt was one of the first guys
to tap into the true market potential

476
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,100
of high-frequency trading.

477
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,060
Look at this.
Home run after home run after home run.

478
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,820
And now he has finally gone public.

479
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,820
Folks, there isn't a better bet out there.
Not bonds, not IRAs,

480
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,300
not your savings account.

481
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,721
None of them are as safe as Walt Camby.

482
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,365
Cut it, Jim.

483
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,700
Patty, put the numbers back up there.
Give me another fix.

484
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,660
Come on.
Oh, my God, I'm going weak in the knees.

485
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,762
- I was exaggerating to make a point.
- You lost a bet, Lee.

486
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,860
I made a bad call.
How much are you into Ibis for?

487
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,291
Sixty grand.

488
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,820
Sixty grand? This is about sixty grand?

489
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,700
Pocket change to you, right?

490
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,484
Yeah, it kind of is. Okay, look.

491
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,500
You give me five minutes,
and I can get you 60 grand in cash here,

492
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,620
and I can make you whole.

493
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,961
- That won't make me whole.
- All right. What's a number that will?

494
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,284
$800 million.

495
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,500
It's gonna take me a little longer
to get $800 million here, pal.

496
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,500
That's how much went
fucking poof into thin air, you dumb shit.

497
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,580
So that's what you owe us. 'Cause I'm not
the only one watching your show.

498
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,700
I'm not the only shareholder
who got screwed over here.

499
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,020
You're the only shareholder here with a gun.

500
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,620
You think you're fucking funny, Lee?
Is this funny to you?

501
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,085
Lee, don't provoke him.

502
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,643
You must think I'm so stupid.

503
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,687
Trying to fucking buy me off.

504
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,130
I'm not stupid, Lee.

505
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,483
I walked in here knowing there was only
one way this show was gonna end.

506
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,564
I came in here knowing I'm not walking out.

507
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,520
Sit down.

508
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,300
Sit down.

509
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,740
Where the hell is ESU?
And where's my negotiator?

510
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,444
Negotiator's two minutes out.

511
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,740
- Patty Fenn.
- This is Captain Marcus Powell.

512
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,780
The network confirmed
you can stay live on the air.

513
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,860
Just keep stalling him.

514
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,060
What do you mean "keep stalling"?

515
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,220
Tell him to say whatever it is this guy
wants to hear until we put a plan in place,

516
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,940
whatever it takes to keep him
from setting off that bomb.

517
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,060
Jesus.

518
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,207
Fuck off.

519
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,682
Lee? You have to keep stalling.

520
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,740
Just keep talking to him.

521
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,526
You're good at that. So just keep talking.

522
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,485
Talk.

523
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,202
Listen, I get it. What happened at Ibis is...
It's a disaster, there's no other word for it.

524
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,540
I can promise you that Walt Camby

525
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,371
is as sick about this as anybody else.

526
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,649
Yeah? Is that what he told you
from his private fucking jet?

527
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,207
Listen, if anybody is gonna
bounce back from it,

528
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,420
it's Walt and Ibis.
This was an isolated incident.

529
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,851
- What's this?
- It's completely unrelated...

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,884
What is this? Who wrote this?

531
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,169
- Somebody from my office.
- "Diane Lester."

532
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,860
You see? This is what I'm talking about.
That's your problem.

533
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,380
You just sit there
behind their little fucking desk,

534
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,980
like their little fucking puppet,
buying into their bullshit,

535
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,140
instead of trying to figure out
what really happened.

536
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,100
You know what happened.
It was a computer glitch.

537
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,980
A glitch! A glitch!
It was a fucking glitch! A glitch!

538
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,320
Shut up about the glitch!

539
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,041
All right?

540
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,004
What the hell does that even mean?

541
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,884
You see, you don't even know.
I'm not stupid, Lee. I told you.

542
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,860
People just at home accepting this shit,
they're the stupid ones,

543
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,500
because somehow these clowns

544
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,340
lost $800 million overnight.

545
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,965
Overnight.

546
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,560
And nobody's even actually explained how.

547
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,565
How is something like that even possible?

548
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,445
How is that even fair?

549
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,251
How's that fair?

550
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,407
It's not a rhetorical question.
I want a fucking answer.

551
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,700
What do you want from me, man?

552
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,020
I don't run Ibis. I'm just a guy on TV.

553
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,980
No, no. Do not do that, Lee. Do not do that.

554
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,809
You don't get to pass the buck today, Lee.

555
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,728
Not today. Not with me.

556
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,380
So, what do we know about him so far?

557
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,643
Name's Kyle Budwell.
No wants, no warrants, no priors.

558
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,860
We sent a patrol to his residence
to locate family.

559
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,883
They won't find anyone. The guy's a loner.

560
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,340
Hundred bucks says this poor shithead
either lives by himself or with his mother.

561
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,380
The real losers tend to stay home
with their mommies.

562
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,326
But, hey, do your thing.
But watch and see, the guy's a loner.

563
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,500
Yes?

564
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,300
Can you patch this line directly into
the studio PA system for us, please, Patty?

565
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,562
- We have a negotiator here.
- Okay.

566
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,002
Charlie? Patch this line
into the PA system, please. Right now.

567
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,060
It's all about...
It's high-frequency trading. It can...

568
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,003
Let us know when we're on.

569
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,170
Can he hear me?

570
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,060
This is Oscar Nelson.
I'm a veteran negotiator with the NYPD.

571
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,128
No. I don't want to talk to no cops.

572
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,860
Don't think of me as a cop.

573
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,564
Hey, what'd I just say? No cops!

574
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,500
Cut the line! Cut it.

575
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,620
I can handle it myself.

576
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,700
Anybody comes on that mike,

577
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,926
you gonna put a bullet in his head.
You hear me?

578
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,220
- Cut the line. Cut it.
- Cut the line, Charlie. Right now.

579
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,209
Do not cut this...

580
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,540
Two people I came here to talk to.
Him and Walt fucking Camby.

581
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,220
All right, well, then let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

582
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,060
All right, so let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

583
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,100
Right. Exactly. Throw him under the bus.

584
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,220
Look, he was supposed to be here today.
He didn't show up.

585
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,940
It's his company. It's his crash.
So let's see what he has to say.

586
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,041
Right. Yes.

587
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,620
- What happened to the Ibis feed?
- I have no idea.

588
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,820
God damn it.

589
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,980
All right, find me Bree.

590
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,460
Have her call Diane Lester
back on the phone.

591
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,900
I want her back up on that screen.

592
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,100
And find out everything and anything
you can about Ibis Clear Capital.

593
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,620
- Got it.
- Yes, what is it?

594
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,100
I want the PA system available
in case we need to speak to him again.

595
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,460
Right.
Because it worked so well the first time.

596
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,380
Look, just make sure you answer this phone.

597
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,006
We'll be right downstairs
exploring means of extraction.

598
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,201
I have Patty Fenn from Money Monster
on line three.

599
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,300
Marta, when is he landing?

600
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,140
I don't even know which plane he's on,
so I've no way of tracking him.

601
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,500
He took the G-V to Geneva on Tuesday,

602
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
but then he sent that to Hong Kong
to pick up Harvey Bergan.

603
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,126
Last location I have for the Learjet
was Sao Paulo on Monday.

604
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,660
Monday? That's four days ago.

605
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,660
You know how he is with his planes.
When he's in the air, he's off the grid.

606
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,780
Are you telling me that until he lands,
whenever the hell that may be, that he's...

607
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,500
He's completely unreachable.
Which makes this one big clusterfuck.

608
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,820
I have Patty Fenn on hold.
What should I tell her?

609
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,921
She'll call back.

610
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,287
Come on.

611
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,180
Diane Lester's office
is giving me the runaround.

612
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,220
Okay, Bree.

613
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,620
Dave, I need an address for Ibis, ASAP.

614
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,180
And, Bree, try Dan Issa at the SEC.

615
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,620
They've got to be
sniffing around this train wreck already.

616
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,500
Keep stalling, Lee. We're on it.

617
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,700
Lenny, can you come around on this guy?
I'm losing him in a little shadow.

618
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,201
- You kidding me?
- Just move in.

619
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,485
What the hell are you doing?

620
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,900
Director wanted a better angle on your face.

621
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,161
There's kind of a...

622
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,320
A little shadow.

623
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,121
"A little shadow"?

624
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,085
Patty, "A little shadow"?

625
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,620
He could have killed you
much easier off camera, Lee.

626
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,900
There's a reason
he's interrupted you on live TV.

627
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,220
Look, give me a break, guy.
I'm just trying to do my job.

628
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,163
They tell me to move in, I move in.

629
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,323
All right, where do you want to go?

630
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,140
Well, if you went over there,
it would be good.

631
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,740
- Here?
- Yeah.

632
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,700
See, I'm directing a show back here,
which means you're hosting one up there.

633
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,802
So start hosting.

634
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,961
Okay, first things first.

635
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,780
- What's your name?
- Don't worry about my name.

636
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,860
You're on TV. Trust me.

637
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,930
They're gonna know your Little League
batting average by the time this is through.

638
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,020
His name is Kyle Budwell.
The cops already tracked down his info.

639
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,249
Doesn't even have to be your real name.
Just give me anything I can call you.

640
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,363
Fine. Call me Kyle.

641
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,884
Okay, Kyle.

642
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,726
Got the address.

643
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,620
All right, that's midtown.
Listen, Ibis is ducking our calls.

644
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,580
I say we send somebody there
in person instead.

645
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,140
- All right.
- Alan, see if you can put a mike on this guy.

646
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,700
Lee, talk him through this.
I don't want him spooked.

647
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,540
- Kyle, listen.
- Yeah.

648
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,380
This is Alan. He's our sound guy.

649
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,404
He wants to put a microphone on you,
so you can... No, it's okay. It's okay.

650
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,563
You want people
to be able to hear you, right?

651
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,740
- Why, they couldn't hear me before?
- They could... This will be better.

652
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,620
We're tracking down Ron now.
I'm gonna put him on the air with you.

653
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,780
- Kyle.
- Yeah?

654
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,140
I'm gonna send one of my guys
over to Ibis's office

655
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,447
and see if they can
get some answers in person.

656
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,491
We've got a producer.
This kid's name is Ron.

657
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,844
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

658
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,380
- Christ!
- Oh, my God!

659
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,340
Ron! This stuff really works!

660
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,860
- What's the stock trading at?
- $4.25.

661
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,961
Christ!

662
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,620
Shit, shit, shit. Shit. My phone.

663
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,020
- No, it's okay. I need a break, anyway.
- Hold on.

664
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,485
- Yeah?
- Hang on, Ron.

665
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,246
Hey, Charlie.

666
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,220
Hi, Ron.
I'm gonna put you on the air with Lee.

667
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,460
Lee, you've got Ron. Patching Ron in.

668
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,580
What do you mean
you're putting me on the air?

669
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,660
You're going on the air?

670
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,842
Who is that? Where are you?

671
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,289
I'm in my office with Arlene.

672
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,851
Who'd you just tell my name to?

673
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,765
Is that Arlene from Product Placement?

674
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,260
Get off my jeans.

675
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,044
I thought you said the building was cleared.

676
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,885
It was. We walked every floor.

677
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,645
So, what's up, Lee?

678
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,500
Hey, are you coming back?

679
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,900
Where are you right now?

680
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,020
I've just been going through tapes
for tomorrow,

681
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,580
but everything looks good,
so I think we should be in good shape, so...

682
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,842
Holy shit! That guy has a gun!

683
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,406
Imagine my surprise.

684
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,020
Now, do us a favor and get your ass
down to Ibis Clear Capital,

685
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,326
would you, please?

686
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,540
Okay.

687
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,900
I like when he has the strippers on.

688
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,001
Right. Right. Sure.

689
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,380
- Don't be a schmuck, Ron. Get moving.
- Is this for real?

690
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,780
Hey, turn it up, will you?

691
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,260
There's a van and a crew
waiting downstairs for you.

692
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,761
Let's go. Come on. Move.
You should be downstairs already. Let's go!

693
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,725
What's taking them so long?

694
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,042
It's midday traffic. What are you gonna do?

695
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,531
Got it.

696
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,283
So the home address is outdated.

697
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,460
The family that's in there now
bought it six months ago

698
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,770
from the estate of one Clara Budwell,
a 62-years-old deceased woman.

699
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,380
Mama's boy. What'd I tell you?

700
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,700
We tracked down the escrow company.

701
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,700
They confirmed all the money from the sale
went to her son. Guess how much?

702
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,780
Sixty grand.

703
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,980
It's a good thing you didn't bet me, pal,
since he fits the profile to a fucking T.

704
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,700
There has to be a current address
with the escrow company.

705
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,801
Somewhere they sent the check to.

706
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,763
- There is, but we need a subpoena to get it.
- Captain.

707
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,620
Get somebody down to the courthouse, ASAP.

708
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,643
Judge Reiner. He'll expedite.

709
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,761
All right.

710
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,300
We can try to gain access
through catwalks here

711
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,020
or a crawlspace here, and get them out
through the hatch in the control room here.

712
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,090
First, we save the hostages.
Second, we take out the psycho.

713
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,844
Okay, we're here.
Just give us a minute to get set up.

714
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,980
- We've got Ron. I'm putting him up.
- Okay, here we go.

715
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,540
We've got Ron Sprecher
reporting from outside...

716
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,500
As if this month couldn't get any worse.

717
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,660
Ron, Ron, can you hear us?

718
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,700
I'm here outside Ibis Clear Capital,
where their CEO...

719
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,380
Security, there's a man down there
with a camera crew.

720
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,740
Make sure he doesn't get in the building
under any circumstances.

721
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,365
What did Teterboro say, Marta?

722
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,300
I gave them the tail numbers
of both of these planes,

723
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,845
no communication with either.

724
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,420
Okay, I'm gonna down there
and try and buy us some time.

725
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,460
I mean, obviously,
this guy just wants some answers.

726
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,500
So do we.

727
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,900
If we knew how we lost $800 million,
we wouldn't have lost $800 million.

728
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,401
I get that, Avery,
but we still have to say something.

729
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,300
Come on. You know Walt. He's an open book.
I know if he was here...

730
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,500
But he's not here, Diane. He's not here.

731
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,980
Okay, we can't just lock ourselves away here
and do nothing and hope it disappears.

732
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,286
We are a publicly-traded company.

733
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,340
We've got shareholders.
We've got a board of directors

734
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,808
and we've got a CEO, even though
we don't know where he is right now.

735
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,700
So, look,
I'm happy to have this conversation again

736
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,804
when Walt lands,
but until then, it's not our call to make.

737
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,140
So, he's got the stage all locked up.
These are the exits, front and rear.

738
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,380
Now, the problem is,

739
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,380
this guy's got complete range of vision
throughout the entire studio.

740
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,060
So our only chance for a clean shot

741
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,860
is from these catwalks above the stage.

742
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,900
We're putting a man in position there
as we speak.

743
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,060
What about the bomb?

744
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,401
This is definitely a dead man's switch
here in his hand,

745
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,966
which means, if you take him out
without disarming the bomb first...

746
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,140
Got the warrant, got an address.
Sending a patrol there now.

747
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,241
Great.

748
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,580
You see this bulge right here?
That's the wireless receiver.

749
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,060
Now, Captain, if we can destroy that,

750
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,527
then the dead man's switch
is just another fucking switch.

751
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,604
Except, in order to destroy it,
we got to what, shoot Gates?

752
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,365
That's where this guy slipped up.

753
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,740
If he wanted to ensure a kill shot,

754
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,940
he should've put the receiver here,
right over the poor bastard's heart.

755
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,361
But instead, he put it down here
next to his left kidney.

756
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,420
If the bullet's on target, we get to him
quick enough to avoid too much blood loss,

757
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,260
there's a good chance, Captain,
he could survive it.

758
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,460
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,860
Are you proposing
we shoot the star of a TV show

760
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,440
live, on air, in front of millions of people?

761
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,780
Yeah.

762
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,300
I need you to talk to somebody
from Ibis Clear Capital.

763
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,820
I need to talk... You wanna touch me?

764
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,220
- Don't put your hands on me.
- Andre? It's okay.

765
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,940
- That's, that's...
- Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.

766
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,620
Do you have an earpiece
so I can hear everyone?

767
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,780
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay, good.

768
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,980
- Come on.
- All right.

769
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,660
We're gonna talk to Diane Lester.
She's the PR lady. She's the...

770
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,740
CCO.

771
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,780
...Chief Communications Officer at Ibis.
Diane?

772
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,020
Okay, get ready to put her on screen two.
We're gonna put her on screen two.

773
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,180
We're ready when you are.

774
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,611
And go, Jim.

775
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,530
- Here she comes.
- All right.

776
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,020
First, let me start off by saying

777
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,740
on behalf of everyone here at Ibis,

778
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,700
we are prepared to do whatever we can
to get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.

779
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,580
Now, I understand that
you've offered to compensate him

780
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,409
for his losses personally, Lee.

781
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,241
Well, we are absolutely willing to do
the same if it helps put an end to all this.

782
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,860
All right, you walk away now,
double your money.

783
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,485
She knows my last name.

784
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,646
Everybody in the five boroughs
knows your last name by now, Kyle.

785
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,540
No, it's too late for your money, lady.

786
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,460
All I want from you is an answer.
I just wanna know what really happened?

787
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,801
Goddamn it!

788
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,810
Well, the truth is

789
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,180
we don't know.

790
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,250
We don't know why the algo
suddenly went haywire.

791
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,300
And we don't know why the fail-safes
built to prevent...

792
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,006
God, I really hope she has more to say
than "We don't know."

793
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,820
We just don't know.

794
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,740
Are you kidding?
This is all she's got? Are you kidding me?

795
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,444
Sacajawea.

796
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,180
Fine.

797
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,204
Are you watching this?
This is getting out of control.

798
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,780
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get
after this idiot blows himself up

799
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,700
is going to be unbelievable.

800
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,620
You thought it was bad before?
It's about to get 100 times more intense.

801
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,220
Look, don't worry, okay? We can handle it.
Gates is an idiot.

802
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,210
Just stay the course, okay?
I'm working Mambo night and day.

803
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,689
I would like to point out
that this affected all of us.

804
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,020
All our board, our managers,
including myself.

805
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,860
Our pensions were depleted overnight.

806
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,420
- Diane.
- Our savings gutted just like yours.

807
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,740
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

808
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,220
Are you trying to make me feel sorry for you?

809
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,380
Is that really what's happening right now?

810
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,260
- No, I just...
- That's exactly what's happening.

811
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,771
I understand you want specifics.

812
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,540
Yeah. So why doesn't
she give him some specifics?

813
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,100
We know this was
a completely isolated incident.

814
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,850
It's what we call a black swan.

815
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,131
It's impossible to predict,
but it's impossible to replicate.

816
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,780
"Black swan"?

817
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,940
That's her memo.

818
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,610
She's reading from her memo.

819
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,740
Diane. Diane.
We both read your talking points.

820
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,460
He doesn't want some PR spin about
what's gonna go right next year.

821
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,420
He wants an explanation
for what went wrong last week.

822
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,521
Yeah.

823
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,300
Right, I understand.
And we believe in complete transparency.

824
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,820
That's why we disclosed...

825
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,820
Where are your quants, Diane?
Where are your quants?

826
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,100
- That's good. Go with that. Get an answer.
- I'm sorry?

827
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,260
- Yeah.
- The quants you used.

828
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,980
The guy who actually designed
the algorithm that crashed.

829
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,900
Where is he? Is he in that
building right there behind you?

830
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,700
'Cause I think
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

831
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,460
No, these are our administrative offices.
Our quants aren't...

832
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,660
Okay, then where is he? Is he in Mumbai?

833
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,940
Russia? Yeah, he's in Russia.
They're all in Russia.

834
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,980
I'm not sure.

835
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,260
But if you'd like to talk to someone,
then I can make that happen.

836
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,540
No, I don't want to talk to
some low-level schlub, God damn it.

837
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,300
I want an explanation from you!

838
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,540
And if you can't give me one,
then I want to talk to Walt Camby.

839
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,801
No, I'm sorry,

840
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,331
- but Walt is on a plane right now.
- God damn...

841
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,460
Shit-fucking assholes.

842
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,180
I'm getting so tired of this same old
bullshit over and over again, Lee.

843
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,940
- Wait.
- Don't tell me to wait!

844
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,980
What happened?

845
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,020
He just shot out your monitor on the stage

846
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,580
because you're giving him
the same corporate bullshit!

847
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,820
I'm not.

848
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,020
You have to understand
how delicate of a situation this is.

849
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,580
I'm sitting 80-feet from a bomb!
Don't talk to me about delicate situations!

850
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,160
You have got to wake up
and do the math here,

851
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,123
because it is not adding up to me, either.

852
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,765
Why is that so goddamn hard?

853
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,980
Sorry, what do you mean?

854
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,820
I mean, you better ask some real questions

855
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,020
and get some real answers,
and hurry the fuck up!

856
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,620
I want what happened to make sense!

857
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,740
Do not talk to him like that.
Do not tell him things.

858
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,980
- Right now!
- Don't do anything stupid.

859
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,100
Let me get you some answers.

860
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,900
You need to bargain for more time. All right?

861
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,140
- Trade something.
- Give me 10 more minutes.

862
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,820
Bargain with him.

863
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,604
Kyle, look.

864
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,803
You give me something,
I give you something. Okay?

865
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,246
That's how this works.

866
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,687
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

867
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,331
Come on.

868
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,924
Give me a chance.

869
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,489
Let me figure this out.

870
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,128
- Fine, you got 10 minutes.
- Okay. All right.

871
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,167
Now what?

872
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,763
I made myself extraordinarily clear
that you were not to go on camera.

873
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,420
I am curious.
Who actually did design that algo?

874
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,980
Why don't we call him together?

875
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,020
Now, you listen to me, Diane. You're a CCO.

876
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,340
And that is all you are and that is nothing.

877
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,660
I've seen a dozen girls like you come and go.

878
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,820
- Really? Girls like me?
- Yeah!

879
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,980
I don't have to stand here
and listen to this.

880
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,260
- Well, you're fired, Diane!
- You can't fire me. I don't report to you.

881
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,443
It's not our job to bail out this psychopath!
Do not walk away from me!

882
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,284
I don't report to you, Avery.

883
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,500
Ryan, get me a list of every quant that's
been on our payroll since we went public.

884
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,500
Walt's G-V radioed Teterboro.
Twenty minutes out.

885
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,570
Have a car waiting downstairs for me.
And get me that list.

886
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,888
This is Eagle One in first position.
Proceeding to two.

887
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,380
Bree, I asked for Dan Issa from the SEC.

888
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,540
I called twice and left word both times.

889
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,641
All right, get me Ron.

890
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,060
Ron, I need you to go down
to the SEC's offices on Vesey Street.

891
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,700
Find Dan Issa. Do not take no for an answer.
You have nine minutes.

892
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,780
Nine minutes?

893
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,724
- Vesey Street's over a mile away.
- Then you better start running now.

894
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,540
Hey, Dave, can you pull up a stock
price graphic for Ibis for me, please?

895
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,140
- Okay. I'll need a second.
- Okay, then put their logo up on the nine-by.

896
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,287
Okay.

897
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,740
Lee? How many people do you think
are tuned into us right now at this moment?

898
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,660
Millions probably? Tens of millions?

899
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,820
That's tens of millions of investors,

900
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,129
all with their fingers
on their E-trade accounts.

901
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,700
Kyle, you bought Ibis at what, $75 a share?

902
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,122
- Yeah. So?
- What if we can get it back there?

903
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,684
How many times I gotta tell you,
it's too late for your money.

904
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,045
You're not the only shareholder
that got screwed over.

905
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,740
You came here because you had something
that you wanted to say.

906
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,340
You want people
to finally listen to you, right?

907
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,441
Yeah.

908
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,180
Well, now they can.

909
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,601
- Logo's ready.
- Put it up on the big screen.

910
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,940
All right, Lee. Go to work.

911
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,122
Watch what we can do.

912
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,220
I want to talk to everybody out there.

913
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,620
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

914
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,780
And here's what I want you to do.

915
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,700
I want you to go to your computer

916
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,940
and I want you to buy Ibis stock.

917
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,620
I'm gonna be upfront with you.

918
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,620
I don't want you to do it
because you're gonna make money.

919
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,290
I want you to do it

920
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,883
because it'll save my life.

921
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,325
This is ballsy.

922
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,300
The old Money Monster bump.

923
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,620
The old Money Monster bump
on a massive scale.

924
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,300
- Where's my stock price?
- Just got it up.

925
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,700
It's simple math. Value comes from demand.

926
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,900
So if every single one of you
buys a few shares,

927
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,820
then we can get the price
of this sucker up in no time.

928
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,649
And here's the crazy part.

929
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,380
If we do it and everybody invests
just a little bit of money,

930
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,660
the price starts to go up.

931
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,940
And then the algorithms... They start to
take notice, and they start to buy it.

932
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,220
Give it to me on the big screen.

933
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,260
If you can fool them,
then the sky's the limit!

934
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,140
Which means that together we can turn
a bad investment into a good one

935
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,340
by sheer force of will.

936
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,660
Nice.

937
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,580
So, as of right now,

938
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,620
I am moving Ibis from a sell to a buy.

939
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,660
He's gonna call a triple.
Ready triple. Roll it.

940
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,841
...and make it a rare...

941
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,242
...Triple Buy!

942
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,045
Come on. Come on.

943
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,647
Come on, you son of a bitch.

944
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,300
Come on, guys.

945
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,926
We're human beings, we're not computers.

946
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,300
We have a conscience.

947
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,180
Refresh, refresh.

948
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,780
- There it is.
- Yeah.

949
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,803
$8.48.

950
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,041
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

951
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,380
We take care of each other.

952
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,766
It's embedded in our DNA.

953
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,887
Not because an equation tells us to,
but because we feel it in here.

954
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,167
And right now, I need your help.

955
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,100
This looks promising.

956
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,531
We can do the right thing.

957
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,860
But we have to do it together.

958
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,928
Come on. Refresh, refresh.

959
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,540
So, I'm talking to every one of you.

960
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,008
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

961
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,900
I want you to dig as deep as you can

962
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,891
and I want you to ask yourself,
what is a life worth to you?

963
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,404
What's my life worth?

964
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,366
I guess that answers that question, huh?

965
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,362
Detective, one coming in.

966
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,180
Ma'am. Excuse me.

967
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,620
Ma'am. NYPD. You live here?

968
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,220
Yeah. What's the problem?

969
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,368
What's your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

970
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,690
Why? Where is he?

971
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,100
Where have you been all day?
If you don't mind me asking.

972
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,580
I work in a glass box underground
for eight hours a day.

973
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,700
So could you please just tell me
what the hell is going on here,

974
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,060
because you're really
starting to freak me out.

975
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,420
I'm gonna ask again.

976
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,921
What is your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

977
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,282
Why don't you take a wild guess.

978
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,327
Powell.

979
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,242
Okay, I'll clear a path.

980
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,406
I should've taken that bet after all,
you sack of shit.

981
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,447
This is really impressive, Lee.

982
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,527
I mean, talk about market influence.

983
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,728
Do you want to know
why that shit didn't work, asshole?

984
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,060
Because even you don't buy
your own bullshit.

985
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,528
You believe in money.
You don't believe in people.

986
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,047
Lee, they tracked down his girlfriend.

987
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,620
They don't believe in you, either.

988
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,420
His pregnant girlfriend.

989
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,603
- You got to be fucking joking.
- No, no joke, Lee.

990
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,140
Quant.

991
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,460
Quantitative analytics.

992
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,642
Look, I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

993
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,649
Does anybody there speak English?

994
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,300
Fuck.

995
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,900
I need the other number
for the guy in Moscow.

996
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,004
Yeah, but he gave me another name.
This one's based out of Seoul.

997
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,846
God damn it. Goodloe.

998
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,521
- Shit.
- I've got it.

999
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,811
Go get me a phone number.
I'm gonna find a translator.

1000
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,460
Amy! Amy! Amy!

1001
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,404
Bring your security pass and come with me.

1002
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,410
Hurts, doesn't it?

1003
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,767
Got your fancy education.

1004
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,606
Got your millions in the bank.

1005
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,809
Think you got it all made.

1006
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,084
You're not such a hot shit right now, huh?

1007
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,162
You want to sit here
and take stock of our lives, Kyle?

1008
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,128
How about we compare scores?

1009
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,780
How about we do that?

1010
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,247
Touchscreen. Shit, the touchscreen.

1011
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,207
All right. We got Kyle and we got Lee.

1012
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,060
Let's start with the obvious. Money.

1013
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,003
I got some. You don't, I gather.

1014
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,770
So, that's a point for me.

1015
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,487
Where you going with this, Lee?

1016
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,620
But then there's family.

1017
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,200
I'm divorced three times.
What about you? You got a wife?

1018
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,940
Girlfriend, then?

1019
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,201
Sacajawea, Lee.

1020
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,120
You got a girlfriend? That's nice.
The magic of young love.

1021
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,940
I think we can both agree
that's a point for you,

1022
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,540
since the first number on my speed-dial
is an escort service.

1023
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,180
- You don't know anything about me.
- I don't need to know about you!

1024
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,580
I know about me.
Seven years, three years, 14 months.

1025
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,540
The marriages, they get shorter
and they get shorter,

1026
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,802
but settlements, they get larger and larger.

1027
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,940
Lee?

1028
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,610
Look at me, Lee.

1029
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,284
Sacajawea.

1030
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,780
Hey, Kyle, you see her?

1031
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,726
That's Patty, my director,
and she wants me to shut up.

1032
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,700
Well, now, she's sick of me, too.

1033
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,044
And that's why she took a job
across the street and didn't tell me.

1034
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,325
People talk.

1035
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,740
They all leave sooner or later, Kyle.
That's just how it works.

1036
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,684
So trust me, that's gonna be a point for you.

1037
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,806
What about kids?

1038
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,331
You got a kid?

1039
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,089
One on the way, maybe?

1040
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,780
Yeah? She's expecting. It's a blessing.

1041
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,020
I have one myself.

1042
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,340
She must be six or seven. I have no idea.

1043
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,965
I send a check.

1044
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,860
Mazel tov on the bundle of joy.

1045
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,660
I think we can both agree
that's another fucking point for you.

1046
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,220
So, now, look at this.

1047
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,460
Kyle. Oh, my God.
We just got started and you're already ahead.

1048
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,380
Just... Just stay wide, Jim.

1049
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,767
So let me ask you something, Kyle.

1050
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,380
What about your life is so much shittier
than the rest of ours

1051
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,528
that you get to throw in the towel early?

1052
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,970
I want to know.

1053
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,540
You got a decent job.
You got two hands and two feet.

1054
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,768
You got a goddamn kid on the way!

1055
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,540
So before you blow me to kingdom come,
I want you to answer one question.

1056
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,644
What makes you such a giant fucking failure
compared to everybody else?

1057
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,420
You really gonna stand there
in your $1,000 suit

1058
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,124
and compare scores with me?

1059
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,340
My honest job pays me $14 an hour,
you cocksucker.

1060
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,204
So let's start there.

1061
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,289
You know how far $14 an hour
gets you here in New York?

1062
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,926
You know how much of that is left
after I pay my rent and all my fucking bills?

1063
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,900
I keep paddling as hard as I can
just to stay above water.

1064
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,260
It takes everything I got!

1065
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,860
And that's before the kid gets here.

1066
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,460
How the hell am I gonna supposed to
support him?

1067
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,660
How am I gonna take care of him?

1068
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,740
You'll take great care of him.

1069
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,180
He gets to grow up being the kid
whose old man blew himself up on live TV.

1070
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,940
- God damn it, Lee.
- He's the goddamn Father of the Year!

1071
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,980
Don't you fucking say
another word about my son

1072
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,220
or I'll end this right fucking now.
You hear me?

1073
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,820
- All right.
- You hear me?

1074
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,380
You want your brains splattered
all over downtown, Lee, huh?

1075
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,970
Mr. Budwell!

1076
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,525
Mr. Budwell.

1077
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,760
Yeah?

1078
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,169
Mr. Budwell, please stand by.

1079
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,841
Stand by for what?

1080
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,405
Stand by for what?

1081
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,123
Hi, Molly. I'm Marcus Powell. Come with me.

1082
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,409
You think I don't know what you're doing?

1083
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,500
I know what you're doing!

1084
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,140
Lee, we're gonna put his girlfriend
onscreen so you can talk to her.

1085
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,260
It's all a big stall.

1086
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,100
And you're gonna keep
your mouth shut until then.

1087
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,420
You hear me?
Sitting up there, trying to figure out

1088
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,966
how to keep me
from pulling this fucking trigger.

1089
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,220
Well, this stupid fuck's
gonna make me shoot him in his head,

1090
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,060
and there's nothing
you can do about it, lady!

1091
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,460
Just remember our only goal
is to get him to put the weapon down.

1092
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,620
Jerking me around all fucking day.

1093
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,370
Okay, Matty, go ahead.

1094
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,091
- Okay.
- Get in there.

1095
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,900
Your 10 minutes were up a long time ago.
Hey. Hey!

1096
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,620
You fucking crazy?
What the fuck are you doing?

1097
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,166
Kyle? Are you there?

1098
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,300
Okay, circle around, circle around
so you get that girl on camera.

1099
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,700
- Kyle? Kyle?
- Molly.

1100
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,100
- Can he see me?
- Yeah, I can see you.

1101
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,565
- Yeah, he can see you.
- Yeah.

1102
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,740
- He's not... Kyle. Kyle?
- Molly.

1103
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,126
Yeah, Molly, where are you?

1104
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,083
- Are you here? Where is she?
- Kyle?

1105
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,060
- Is she outside?
- Can he hear me?

1106
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,366
- Molly?
- Kyle.

1107
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,161
Yeah?

1108
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,370
What are you doing here?

1109
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,980
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

1110
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,209
Kyle, what are you doing here?

1111
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,820
Why... I thought you were working today.

1112
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,921
God.

1113
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,320
You are the dumbest son of a bitch
on the planet, you know that?

1114
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,500
They told me about the money, Kyle.

1115
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,020
You are so fucking stupid.

1116
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,940
That was everything we had.

1117
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,060
That was every last cent.

1118
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,140
You are such a fucking failure, Kyle,
you know that?

1119
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,900
You have always been such a fucking failure.

1120
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,780
- You sat down in the basement all night...
- Molly, just...

1121
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,940
...reading your fucking books, thinking you
are some kind of a smart guy, but you aren't.

1122
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,220
You fucking aren't.
And now you go and you do this?

1123
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,700
You blow all your mother's money
like some kind of a halfwit

1124
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,620
and then you come in here
with a fucking bomb?

1125
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,700
Turn it off, for Christ's sake!

1126
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,260
You hardly even know
how to use a screwdriver!

1127
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,044
That is how useless you are
around the house!

1128
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,740
And now you're going
and you're building fucking bombs?

1129
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,888
Since when did you become
such a man all of a sudden?

1130
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,970
But you're not a man.

1131
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,060
- You're a bitch. That's what you are.
- Turn it off.

1132
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,260
You hear me, Kyle? You are a bitch.

1133
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,001
You cry when we fuck, you pasty little bitch!

1134
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,380
Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!

1135
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,300
- Don't you fucking touch her. Hey!
- I am seven months' pregnant!

1136
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,220
And fuck you, too, Kyle!

1137
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,060
This is all your fucking fault!

1138
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,780
Why don't you just get it over with

1139
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,660
and shoot yourself in the head already,
you chickenshit!

1140
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,685
Come on. Just pull the fucking trigger!
Pull the fucking...

1141
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,401
Hey.

1142
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,727
Kyle.

1143
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,802
Back off, guys. Back off a little bit.
Give us some room. Little bit.

1144
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,050
She's gone. You take a deep breath.

1145
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,445
You keep your finger on that button.

1146
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,369
You hear me, Kyle?

1147
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,660
- Give me some sign that you're hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you.

1148
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,000
Okay.

1149
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,041
Okay, here we go.

1150
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,720
Let's take a seat.

1151
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,801
Come on.

1152
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,651
Come on. That's it.

1153
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,006
Hey.

1154
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,762
It's hard to believe
you're the calm one in the relationship.

1155
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,561
All right.

1156
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,923
It's okay, Kyle.
We've all been there, believe me.

1157
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,649
Just take a minute.

1158
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,660
You take your time.

1159
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,603
Nobody's going anywhere.

1160
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,764
Is that him again? Is that the quant?

1161
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,580
Translate this exactly, Amy, all right?
Tell him I need to ask him some questions

1162
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,650
and if he doesn't talk to me,
then people are going to die.

1163
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,340
Fine. Put her on.

1164
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,488
- Put her on.
- Alright.

1165
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,780
You speak English?

1166
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,460
Listen, lady,
I'm not getting mixed up in all this.

1167
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,900
I was hired to design a program.
My job was about data.

1168
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,180
It was about math.
It was about theoreticals. That's it.

1169
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,060
Yes, but this glitch was still a result
of a program you designed.

1170
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,820
Wrong. It's user error.

1171
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,540
They're only calling it a glitch because
nobody understands how the algo works.

1172
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,540
And if nobody can understand the math,

1173
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,780
then nobody has to explain the money.

1174
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,660
Well, that's why I'm calling you.
I want to understand.

1175
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,841
Fine.

1176
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,540
Algorithms make patterns,
they don't break them.

1177
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,540
And this algo was designed
to move in and out

1178
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,980
of hundreds of positions
in fractions of seconds.

1179
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,060
Right.

1180
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,900
What it wasn't designed to do
is consume large amounts of capital,

1181
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,100
accumulate leveraged positions or...

1182
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,060
Or hold a portfolio
for any extended period of time.

1183
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,180
Wait. What does that mean?

1184
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,060
It means

1185
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,500
there is no way that this algorithm

1186
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,860
could lose $800 million in one afternoon.

1187
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,681
It is literally a mathematical impossibility.

1188
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,420
So whatever went wrong,
whatever investment went haywire,

1189
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,820
it's not the computer's fault.

1190
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,130
There's human fingerprints all over this.

1191
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,849
Whose fingerprints?

1192
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:30,300
Like I said,
I don't want to get involved in this.

1193
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,100
Is there anything you can give me?

1194
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,340
Do the math.

1195
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,240
You can't find your boss,
and he can't find $800 million.

1196
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,122
Where did you say he was coming from?

1197
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,565
What a mess, huh?

1198
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,900
I take it you've heard by now?

1199
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,540
Yeah.

1200
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,211
Goodloe started calling me
the second I turned my phone back on.

1201
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,860
He and I had a disagreement over strategy.

1202
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,803
So I heard.

1203
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,940
You did good.

1204
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,442
I'm proud of you... Whatever Goodloe says.

1205
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,928
Here, I got you some chocolate.

1206
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,370
From Switzerland.

1207
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,249
Hey, I'll take those
and put them in the back for you.

1208
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,764
That's cold.

1209
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,660
Amy, can you sit up front, please?

1210
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,489
And don't say a fucking word.

1211
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,140
She's right. She's fucking right.
She's fucking right.

1212
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,607
She's fucking right!

1213
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,162
God damn it! Jesus.

1214
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,180
God, why do you always do this?

1215
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,860
This isn't good, Lee.

1216
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,100
You're so stupid, Kyle.

1217
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,771
You're so stupid, you stupid pussy.

1218
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,500
She's fucking right.

1219
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,700
Now what?

1220
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,380
What the fuck am I fucking doing?

1221
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,811
Shit!

1222
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,808
Do not...

1223
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,720
I'll do it.

1224
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,220
You got to fucking do it.

1225
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,767
I got to fucking do it.
You stupid piece of fucking shit.

1226
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,140
What the fuck am I fucking doing?
I've got to do this.

1227
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,241
Kyle.

1228
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,647
What am I gonna do? Shoot you?

1229
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,920
I don't want to shoot you, Kyle.
I don't want you to die.

1230
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,844
What chance do I have now?

1231
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,460
There's still a way out of this.
I know there's still a way out.

1232
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,660
Tell me one reason
why I shouldn't put this gun in my mouth

1233
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,380
and pull the fucking trigger.

1234
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,448
Kyle, look at me.

1235
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,580
Hey.

1236
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,330
You made a mistake.

1237
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,042
That doesn't mean your life is over.

1238
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,420
What you need is a plan.

1239
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,260
No way any plan's gonna
help me through this.

1240
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,940
That's 'cause you're not thinking straight.

1241
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,725
I'm willing to help you if you'll let me.

1242
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,580
Step one.

1243
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,140
This gun and this vest
is not helping anything.

1244
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,300
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Signals get crossed. Things get chaotic.

1245
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,260
Innocent people get hurt.
It happens all the time.

1246
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,046
If I let any of these guys go then I'm dead.

1247
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,011
Jesus.

1248
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,561
Jesus.

1249
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,700
All right.

1250
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,245
We'll find another way.

1251
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,166
You got to give me some space.
I need to rethink this.

1252
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,886
Is Fox 2 in position? Make your move.

1253
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,300
A plan, Kyle.

1254
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,084
That's all we need.

1255
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,500
We just got unobstructed access,
north side studio.

1256
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,060
Repeat. Unobstructed access on the north.

1257
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,700
- Go with him. Extraction only, though.
- Sir.

1258
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,723
Do you understand?
Extraction only right now.

1259
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,762
Listen, I agree with you.
We need to get ahead of this one.

1260
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,442
And we're all about transparency, after all.

1261
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,140
I'm the CEO, so I'm the one
who needs to make the statement.

1262
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,260
We just need to make sure it's on our terms,
not on theirs.

1263
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,980
We're all set up at Federal Hall.

1264
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,060
We have the run of the place,
we have security onsite,

1265
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,650
and no one knows you'll be going there.

1266
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,046
We're going in.

1267
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,060
We got company.

1268
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,685
Three, show me.

1269
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,447
Okay, as long as it's controlled.

1270
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,380
Give an exclusive to somebody you trust.

1271
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,660
I know just the person to call.

1272
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,000
That's my girl.

1273
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,251
All right, Lenny?

1274
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,528
I want you to push in.
Block as much of his view as you can.

1275
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,361
Lee?

1276
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,524
Do not make a move.

1277
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,900
If he turns around,

1278
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,650
we are all gonna die.

1279
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,607
Go.

1280
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,460
All right, Lenny.

1281
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,210
You're the last manned camera.

1282
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,087
Balls.

1283
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,401
Patty Fenn.

1284
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,420
Patty, Diane Lester.

1285
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,780
You better have something for me, Diane,
and I mean, right the fuck now.

1286
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,460
It's good to hear your voice, too.

1287
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,980
I'm calling you to let you know
the information I gave you

1288
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,460
might have been incorrect.

1289
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,289
What the hell does that mean? "Incorrect"?

1290
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,300
Walt is going to make a statement after all.

1291
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,500
We're in the car
en route to Federal Hall right now.

1292
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,020
We'll be about 20 minutes away.

1293
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,980
Twenty minutes? We need help right now!

1294
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,140
I'm trying to help you,
if you'll just listen.

1295
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,740
I'm going to send you a text
explaining what I need from you.

1296
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,020
So just keep a lid on it.

1297
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,442
Because I'm giving you this exclusively.
Don't screw it up.

1298
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,605
Reporters.

1299
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,131
Hello? Diane?

1300
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,660
Okay, everybody.
We're gonna begin evacuation one at a time.

1301
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,842
You first. Follow me to the crawlspace.

1302
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,620
We're ready and in position.
Give me the green light, we go.

1303
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,700
If we take out the receiver on Gates' chest,
what's his chance of survival?

1304
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,980
80% that he makes it.

1305
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,460
Okay.
What's the chance the bullet's on target?

1306
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,140
- If it's a clean shot, 100%.
- 100%. Come on, let's be realistic here.

1307
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,820
I am being. Listen, 80% sounds about right
to us, to an officer.

1308
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:33,980
80%.

1309
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,540
So we got an 80% chance of an 80% chance.
Yeah, that's some shit math.

1310
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,122
Benson, let me know
when the control room is ready to evacuate.

1311
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,860
Now we're talking.

1312
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,220
Okay, guys,

1313
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,860
how do we find out what Walt Camby's jet
was doing in South Africa?

1314
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,100
- We could try the FAA.
- No, they won't help us.

1315
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:03,500
What about the hacker guy
from the Citi security breach segment?

1316
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,365
- The guy with the Yoda voice.
- Yes! Yes! Find him. Quickly.

1317
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,042
Watch your head. Step here.

1318
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,043
Bree, where the hell is Ron Sprecher?
And has he gotten to the SEC yet?

1319
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,580
I will check,
but I need to tell you something first.

1320
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,060
Okay, hold on. Just a second.

1321
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,860
Lee, Walt Camby has landed.

1322
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,291
He's on his way to Federal Hall.

1323
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,740
He'll be there in less than 20 minutes.

1324
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,980
And get this. He wasn't in Geneva yesterday.
He was in South Africa.

1325
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,060
So he lied to you. He lied to us.

1326
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,900
He's been lying this whole time.
That means you've been lying, too, Lee.

1327
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,447
To everybody that's been watching. To Kyle.

1328
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,281
Oh, my God.

1329
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,689
Where'd everybody go?

1330
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,441
Where'd they go?

1331
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,740
God damn it!

1332
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,420
I knew this would happen.

1333
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,620
- Let's go. Who's next?
- Charlie, in the sound booth.

1334
01:05:58,720 --> 01:05:59,700
How stupid am I?

1335
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,100
Okay. Quick as you can.

1336
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,440
Get those hackers working.

1337
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,570
It's all your fault, Lee. You so stupid.

1338
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,690
This is Dave.

1339
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,086
I got your email, Dave.

1340
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,124
Help you, we will.

1341
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,700
This is Eagle One. Target is in position.

1342
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,040
Bunch of crooks.

1343
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,580
Camby's never coming here.
We have to figure out a way, Kyle.

1344
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,820
Patty, I really need to tell you something.

1345
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,500
Okay, hold on, just a second, Bree.

1346
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,568
No! Damn it! You need to hear this.

1347
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,340
Okay. What is it?

1348
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,920
Don't stop. Don't panic. Stay low.

1349
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,100
I'm so fucked!

1350
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,300
- Eagle, Do you have a clean shot?
- I'm yellow. Yellow.

1351
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,811
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1352
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,180
They're going to shoot Lee.
I heard every word. I was five-feet away.

1353
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,100
Let's go. This isn't voluntary.

1354
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,725
- Grab whatever you can grab.
- Jim. Take Jim.

1355
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,965
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

1356
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,008
I can't catch a fucking break.

1357
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,180
I'm never getting out of here. Fuck!

1358
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,260
Lee.

1359
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,442
- Just one time. One fucking time.
- They're making us leave.

1360
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,642
- Don't stop. It's gonna be fine.
- I'm good. Get Patty.

1361
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,660
Look at me.

1362
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,380
Don't look up. Look at me.

1363
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,451
There is a sniper on the catwalk
at your one o'clock.

1364
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,730
Where'd they fucking go?

1365
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,420
He's about to lose it, Benson.

1366
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,000
- Hold on. I got one lagging.
- Benson, hurry the hell up!

1367
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,487
There is a receiver on your vest.

1368
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,810
- Two seconds, I pull out my cuffs.
- Don't look down.

1369
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,460
If he shoots it out, it disables the trigger.

1370
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,766
Get out of there, right now!

1371
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,860
Come on!

1372
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,860
- You got a shot?
- Are you green or red?

1373
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,325
- Green.
- Take the shot!

1374
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,450
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Fuck!

1375
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,051
The button!

1376
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,140
- Are you all right?
- What the fuck?

1377
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,527
They're shooting at me, not you!
God damn it!

1378
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,100
Just keep your finger on the button.

1379
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,406
Lee, can you hear me?

1380
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,340
What is this? You been talking to the cops
this whole time?

1381
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,726
That's Patty.

1382
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,840
Listen to me!

1383
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,124
She found Walt Camby.

1384
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,500
I'm gonna take you to him.
But you got to trust me.

1385
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,045
I got a plan.

1386
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,562
Listen, you got to block my vest.

1387
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,521
Go.

1388
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,769
- Hey, wait. What are we doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1389
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,885
Give me the mike.

1390
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,300
Are you setting me up?

1391
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,370
You want some answers?
We're gonna get some answers.

1392
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,780
Lenny, you coming?

1393
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,211
We're coming out!

1394
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,420
Lenny.

1395
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,567
You mind?

1396
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,521
Balls.

1397
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,404
Holy shit.

1398
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,248
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't like elevators.

1399
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,051
Come on, Lenny.

1400
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,090
Lenny, where are you?

1401
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,780
What did I ever do to deserve
such a loyal goddamn crew, Lenny?

1402
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,405
- Not much.
- That's right.

1403
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,842
I need a satellite van and an audio package
downstairs in two minutes.

1404
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,140
Lenny, where are you?

1405
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,940
Jim, where's my feed with Lenny?
I need it right now.

1406
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,087
Come on, Lenny.

1407
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,140
Patty tells us to stay, we stay.

1408
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,605
Okay, Lenny's up! He's live.

1409
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,122
Yeah, Patty. It's always Patty.

1410
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:54,330
My first day on the job she told me
I had a penis where my brain should be.

1411
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,363
She's right. She's always right.

1412
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,980
She stayed here longer
than she should have.

1413
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,081
I know that.

1414
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,046
The truth is I don't know what I'd do
without her at this point.

1415
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,651
But if she was standing right here,
right now, I couldn't admit that.

1416
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,363
But luckily it's just you in front of me,
Lenny. You and your...

1417
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,289
Your warm eyes and your gentle soul.

1418
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,364
All right, get the fuck out of here.

1419
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,847
- I got a signal.
- Okay, are we live?

1420
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,220
Time to find Diane Lester. Let's go.

1421
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,607
- If you're still with us, here we go.
- Come on.

1422
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,930
- We're going that way, Lenny. That way.
- Okay.

1423
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,686
- Captain.
- No.

1424
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,329
We're on the move. Clear a path.

1425
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,180
- That van comes with us!
- Clear the sat van.

1426
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,660
What are these people doing here?

1427
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,260
Now they've left the building.

1428
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,780
They are taking to the streets.

1429
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,886
Kyle Budwell and host Lee Gates
seem to be working together at this point.

1430
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,201
Hello?

1431
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,420
We're on our way to you now,
but we need something more.

1432
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,860
We've figured out where,
we need to find out why.

1433
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,420
He's been lying about everything.

1434
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,220
Keep him away from the news
until we figure out the connection.

1435
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,970
I understand.

1436
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,340
Here. You should put your suit on.

1437
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,500
I'll come back up for you
once they're all set up.

1438
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,840
Thanks.

1439
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,807
Jim, throw the feed into my sat van.

1440
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,020
You stay with Lenny on foot.
We're gonna go nat sound from his camera.

1441
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,122
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

1442
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,331
Patty! I just left the SEC.
I've been trying to call you.

1443
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,441
Yeah, Ron, listen.

1444
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,780
- Yeah, they got nothing over here.
- What?

1445
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,121
Ibis's algorithm trades in dark pools,

1446
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,420
so all their transactions are concealed.

1447
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,940
The one thing I was able to find out was,
on the day of the crash,

1448
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,740
Ibis's transaction volume

1449
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,780
dropped by nearly 90%.

1450
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,120
What does that mean?

1451
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,125
I don't know.

1452
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,700
How far away are you?

1453
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,580
I'm on... Where am I? I'm on Vesey Street.

1454
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,300
Bring me what you have, Ron.
I'll meet you at the corner of Pearl and Pine.

1455
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,500
Start running. I'll see you in three minutes.

1456
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,940
What, three minutes? That's a half-mile away!
I can't run a half-mile in three...

1457
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,041
Hello?

1458
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,300
What are you folks doing?

1459
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,580
He's not O.J.!
Get off the street! That's a bomb!

1460
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,180
Bombs explode.

1461
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,860
You don't want to be near them
when they do.

1462
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,500
Frank Ross,
reporting from the eye in the sky.

1463
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,100
He is safely hovering above them.

1464
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,940
It's a rather distressing scene
down here, honestly.

1465
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,020
New Yorkers flocking to the melee
despite repeated police warnings

1466
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,460
to stay clear of the path of a man
with a bomb strapped to his chest.

1467
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,860
Apparently, a lot of people
sharing the feelings

1468
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,540
of gunman Kyle Budwell this moment.

1469
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,980
They are lining the streets,
they're cheering him on, as if to say,

1470
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,684
"Hey, Ibis, show us the money."

1471
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,220
They're a bunch of crooks!
Blow 'em all to hell!

1472
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,606
Get off me, man! Come on!

1473
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,980
Stay close.
Don't let them get a shot at the vest.

1474
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,163
Now might be a good time
to tell you something about that vest then.

1475
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,340
There's not actually any Semtex in there.
It's just clay. Blocks of clay.

1476
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,420
What?

1477
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,842
Yeah, I wanted to get your attention,
not blow up a goddamn building.

1478
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,683
Stand down. Easy.

1479
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,100
Well, they think it's real.

1480
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,100
So whatever you do, don't take your finger
off that goddamn trigger.

1481
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,780
We're in this together, you dumb shit.

1482
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,700
The drama featuring
host Lee Gates and Kyle Budwell.

1483
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,620
Wow, this is getting crazy!

1484
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,940
Look at all these people!

1485
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,883
My phone is blowing up on this.

1486
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,340
If Kyle makes it out of this thing,
we got to get him on the show.

1487
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,365
And the next time I have a bad day,
I'm gonna come in, "Glitch!"

1488
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,460
Diane, why would Ibis's trading volume
suddenly drop 90%?

1489
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,700
90%?

1490
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,140
No, that's not possible.
Ibis's algorithms trade continuously.

1491
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,891
Somebody would have had to have
taken the computers offline.

1492
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,087
They would have...

1493
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,363
Human fingerprints.

1494
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,085
Walt.

1495
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,540
If Walt took that $800 million
away from the algorithm,

1496
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,140
what did he do with it?

1497
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,527
I have his phone. Shit.

1498
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,300
He's deleted all his emails.

1499
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,620
Try texts.

1500
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,700
Goodloe.

1501
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,980
Mambo... Mambo...

1502
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,060
He and the COO keep mentioning
"Mambo" over and over again.

1503
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,180
"Mambo"?

1504
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,700
Mambo, like the dance?

1505
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,580
- "Mambo"?
- Keep it clear. Back it up, back it up!

1506
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,284
Hey! Hey!

1507
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,180
Get out of the way! Hey!

1508
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,361
Get out of the way!

1509
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,460
Patty!

1510
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,005
- We're on it, Diane.
- Stop. Stop. Stop. Patty.

1511
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,380
Get this earpiece to Lee.
He needs to hear me.

1512
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,100
Great. But how exactly
am I supposed to get this to him?

1513
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,044
I don't know, Ron. You're a producer.
Produce your way up there!

1514
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,611
I'm not getting anything on the terminal.
I'm gonna do a web search.

1515
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,049
Okay, I'm getting...

1516
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,940
"Mambo Pizza Place..."

1517
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,180
"Mambo Italiano..." I'm not finding anything.

1518
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,500
"Mambo Snakes."

1519
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,700
"Mamba" snakes. That's not it.

1520
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,780
Try "Mambo South Africa."
Try anything South African.

1521
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,881
Got it. One sec.

1522
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,321
Holy shit.

1523
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,962
It's not a program. It's a goddamn person.

1524
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,086
Remember Zuccotti Park!

1525
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,086
Occupy Wall Street!

1526
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,242
Hey, Lee! Lee!

1527
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,001
Hey!

1528
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,407
Lee!

1529
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,287
Lee!

1530
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,083
Do it, man! Come on. Blow this mother up!

1531
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,721
Lee! Lee, hey! Lee! Your earpiece!

1532
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,846
- Shit.
- Ron!

1533
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,165
Do not shoot!

1534
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,851
Do not shoot!

1535
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,726
Lee, can you hear me?

1536
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,940
Camera mike's down.
He's not gonna be able to respond.

1537
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,408
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stay where you are!

1538
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,401
Lee?

1539
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,448
Lee, are you there?
If you can hear me, put your hand in the air.

1540
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,965
Okay. I can see you, but I can't get to you.

1541
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,883
What am I gonna do?

1542
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,844
We either keep going or we stop.
It's up to you.

1543
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,860
ESU, forward.

1544
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,740
First window we get,
we're taking the assailant down.

1545
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,921
Move them back.

1546
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,123
- Stay down.
- Stay behind the car.

1547
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,780
Diane, are you still there?

1548
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,860
Yeah, I'm here.

1549
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,803
Okay. We are on Mambo.

1550
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,700
Our van can't get any closer.

1551
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,220
So keep Walt there.

1552
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,164
Do not let him run before Lee can get to you.

1553
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,660
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

1554
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,921
All right. Get on it, Dave.

1555
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,610
Print out everything you can
on this miners' strike.

1556
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,849
- I'm gonna need that, too.
- Okay.

1557
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,041
Lee?

1558
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,524
You can hear me now.

1559
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,329
Which is good.

1560
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,260
I have a lot to explain,

1561
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,523
and I need you to listen
very carefully for once.

1562
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,605
We're approaching Federal Hall.

1563
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,722
Jesus. Is that live?

1564
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,965
It is now.

1565
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,020
Did you get all that?
And that's before we start digging.

1566
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,169
- Ibis is a pig in a prom dress, Lee.
- Got it.

1567
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,820
We are trying to find the proof right now.

1568
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,660
See if you can get those hacker guys.
Find out what they've come up with.

1569
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,140
Now, Lee,
we're making a pretty big leap here.

1570
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,700
So if Walt's gonna hang himself,
you're gonna have to hand him that rope.

1571
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,327
I'll just point the camera in your direction,
and we'll figure it out together.

1572
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,643
Hey. Get ready for a show.

1573
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,900
Well, these guys are certainly behaving

1574
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,380
like they've got an appointment
with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO.

1575
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,780
Which begs the question
on everyone's mind,

1576
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,689
where is Walt Camby?

1577
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,780
As a curious crowd assembles
outside Federal Hall,

1578
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,260
the missing piece of the puzzle...

1579
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,486
I trusted you.

1580
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,608
Yeah, well, I trusted you, too.

1581
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,168
So I guess that means we're both wrong.

1582
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,485
What did you do, Diane?
I mean, you know me.

1583
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,460
You know me better than my wife.

1584
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,688
- You know me better than anybody.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1585
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,260
I have no idea what you think I did.

1586
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,885
Save it for the cameras, Walt.

1587
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,620
An eyewitness in the crowd
may just have the answer.

1588
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,860
Walt Camby?

1589
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,180
He's inside. He just went up those stairs
and through those doors.

1590
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,260
- You saw him?
- That's right.

1591
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,300
Guess there's nowhere to run now, huh?

1592
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,370
This story does seem to be coming
to some sort of head down here.

1593
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,780
- Hey there, big shot.
- Hey.

1594
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,420
- Ready for that interview now?
- Hey.

1595
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,500
Hey.

1596
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,648
You're just in time for the show.

1597
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,980
How was Geneva?

1598
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,540
- It was fine.
- Yeah, I hear it's lovely this time of year.

1599
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,005
Can we get him a chair?

1600
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,090
Sam, give him a chair.

1601
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,540
The Iceland guys just came through
with all the facial recognition data.

1602
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,500
This footage goes back months.

1603
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,100
Everywhere he's traveled.
There's way too much stuff.

1604
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,340
Okay, well, just focus on the last 48 hours.
And cue up the video package.

1605
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,580
Can we get everybody outta here?
Young lady, please, exit the building.

1606
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,060
Wait a second, why does she get to leave?

1607
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,820
This might be able to help
with your investigation.

1608
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,540
This is all her fault.

1609
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,980
Go ahead, Diane, walk away.

1610
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,740
You're the only reason we're stuck here
with this psycho.

1611
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,260
You wanted transparency, Walt?
Well, here's your chance.

1612
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,361
Let's go.

1613
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,441
Everybody hates you.

1614
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,129
Okay, now look, everything is fine.

1615
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,300
So why don't we just put the weapons down,
and let's just talk about it.

1616
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,449
No, I... I think we can talk
with the weapons up. Right, guys?

1617
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,726
- This is Money Monster, coming to you live.
- Back off.

1618
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,100
We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.

1619
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,700
So, Walt,
now that we have you here in person,

1620
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,280
we can finally ask the $800 million question.

1621
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,885
What happened at Ibis, Walt?

1622
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,641
As we've been saying since day one,
this was an isolated computer glitch.

1623
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,700
Goddamn it!

1624
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,540
- Glitch!
- He doesn't really like that word.

1625
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,180
I fuckin' hate that word!

1626
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,500
Not the glitch.

1627
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,380
- Cue up video one.
- I fucking hate that word.

1628
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,403
And then line the rest of 'em up on my mark.

1629
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,322
You tried to convince us it's all too
complicated for us to understand.

1630
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,888
But it's not that complicated at all, is it?

1631
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:51,120
It's actually the oldest story
in the book. Fraud.

1632
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,060
You took money out of your fund
and you invested it here.

1633
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,321
Go.

1634
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,368
Right here in platinum mines in South Africa.
Does that sound familiar?

1635
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,780
I don't have our portfolio in front of me.
I can't exactly...

1636
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,500
You really need your portfolio
to know where you put $800 million?

1637
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,500
I don't put that much money anywhere.

1638
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,860
The algorithms control our day-to-day...

1639
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,060
But that's not how high-frequency trading
is supposed to work, is it?

1640
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,260
They don't just put that much money
in one place

1641
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,249
and just leave it there, do they?

1642
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,926
It wasn't the algos pullin' the strings,
it was you.

1643
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,100
The miners' union strike here
outside Johannesburg is on its second week.

1644
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,380
You. You bought and paid
for a two-week strike.

1645
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,084
Come on. This is ridiculous.

1646
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,521
Go.

1647
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,780
The strike had caused
the mining company's stock to drop.

1648
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,884
You buy low, you get the strike to stop,
you sell high.

1649
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,201
That's the plan.

1650
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,450
You make one big bribe to the right guy,
line your own pockets,

1651
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,686
and no one'll be the wiser.

1652
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,140
You're making accusations
that have no basis in reality.

1653
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,287
Video three on my mark.

1654
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,020
- All right, all right, all right. One...
- Get it together.

1655
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,340
- Okay, it's there. Got it.
- It's defamation, okay?

1656
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,620
And there are laws about that.

1657
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,620
Go on, Walt.
Tell me about all the laws I'm breaking.

1658
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,300
Ready when you are, Lee. On your mark.

1659
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,460
Look, I'll give you this.

1660
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,060
There really was a glitch in your system.
It just wasn't the computer.

1661
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,780
It was this guy. Moshe Mambo.

1662
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,006
We must say no!

1663
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,660
We must say no to their businesses!
We must say no to their bribes!

1664
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,684
You tried to bribe the one guy
that couldn't be bought.

1665
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,406
All they care about is money!

1666
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:21,244
If it takes two years, if it takes 20 years,

1667
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,100
we will stay here and strike
until our voices are heard.

1668
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,247
Pause.

1669
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,482
There. Right there. That's your glitch.

1670
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,660
Because that's what sent
the mining company's stock plummeting,

1671
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,286
which sent
your secret $800 million investment

1672
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,731
right into the toilet.

1673
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,683
Want me to keep goin'?

1674
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,660
- Patty. You gotta see this.
- You made people a lot of money, Walt.

1675
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,060
You just needed to wreck industries and
destroy economies all over the world to do it.

1676
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,289
Okay. Get that ready right now. Lee?

1677
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,100
You're gonna say everything I say.

1678
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,201
This is insane.

1679
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,700
I don't know the first thing
about some South African workers' strike.

1680
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,041
I've never even heard of this Mambo.

1681
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,300
- Really? Never?
- Really? Never?

1682
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,100
Well, what were you two arguing about
this morning?

1683
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,965
Then what were you two arguing about
this morning

1684
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,980
at 8:02 a.m., local time?

1685
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,380
Or maybe they're speaking Swahili
in Geneva these days.

1686
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,450
They don't speak Swahili
in South Africa, either.

1687
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,340
And this wasn't the first time
you did it, either.

1688
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,046
This was just the first time
it didn't work out.

1689
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,164
You feel that, Walt?

1690
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:29,366
That sticky heat
risin' up the back of your neck?

1691
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,324
That flop sweat?

1692
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,005
That's fear.

1693
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,642
Greed you're already acquainted with.

1694
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,291
That's all a great story, Lee.
I'm actually sorry the real one's so boring.

1695
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,860
But the truth is,
our computational systems are far too...

1696
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,380
You know, forget it. Just shoot him.

1697
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,323
Actually, I got a better idea.

1698
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,489
Up. Up, up, up.

1699
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,447
Take the vest off. Put it on him.

1700
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,860
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

1701
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,300
Hold on.
That's just gonna make things worse.

1702
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,164
I already told you, back off.

1703
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,601
Fuckin' cops.

1704
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,524
- Lenny.
- All right.

1705
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,649
- Now? Okay.
- Just right here.

1706
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:06,380
Listen, I'm gonna do you a solid.
And trust me on this.

1707
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,209
Don't turn your back on anybody.

1708
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,207
You're a thief, Walt.

1709
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,100
And a crook.

1710
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,770
And I want to hear you admit it.

1711
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,980
I didn't steal a dime,

1712
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,540
- and we didn't do anything illegal.
- Bullshit!

1713
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,740
- You manipulated stock prices.
- You don't care what I'm gonna say.

1714
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,940
- You bribed people.
- You need someone to blame.

1715
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,860
- You broke the law.
- You've already decided it's gonna be me.

1716
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,203
What law?
Name one law you can prove I broke.

1717
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,409
No, don't look at him.
He can't prove it, either.

1718
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,126
This is just business.
And this is how business is done.

1719
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,851
- That doesn't make it right.
- Please.

1720
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,570
Tell that to the Chinese.

1721
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,940
Tell that to the Russians.
'Cause if it's not us, it's gonna be them.

1722
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,087
Hell, it already is.

1723
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,660
You see, that's the irony about all this.

1724
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,603
You only came after me
'cause I lost you money.

1725
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,540
Nobody was asking questions
when everybody was makin' a profit.

1726
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,484
You just gobbled up every dollar of stock
you could afford.

1727
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,900
As long as we kept paying you 18% ROI
every year,

1728
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,460
then you could keep bragging to your friends
about what a genius you are.

1729
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,420
But, hey, you're not a genius,

1730
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,620
you're a stockholder.

1731
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,900
I told you what I want.

1732
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,980
Yeah, I get it. You want a profit.
That's what everybody wants.

1733
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,940
- No, that's not what I want.
- Listen, just give us some time.

1734
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,020
We're gonna make every single dime...

1735
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,380
I want to hear you admit it,
you son of a bitch!

1736
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,481
I think he just did.

1737
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,604
No, I want to hear him say that he lied,
that what he did was wrong.

1738
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:16,140
Wrong? What does that even mean, wrong?

1739
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,980
You got three seconds till I blow your ass
outta this goddamn building.

1740
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,140
- Three.
- What's wrong with makin' a profit?

1741
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,060
- What's wrong with being faster...
- Two!

1742
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,620
What's wrong with betting big?
Winning isn't wrong...

1743
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,085
- One!
- Fine!

1744
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,726
It was wrong.

1745
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,450
- It was wrong.
- Oh, my...

1746
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,166
It was wrong.

1747
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,725
It was wrong.

1748
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,409
That's all I wanted to hear, man.

1749
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:44,971
- Did you hear that?
- Nice.

1750
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,681
Kyle, don't.

1751
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,131
Kyle, don't.

1752
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,444
- Kyle, don't!
- No! Fuck! Don't!

1753
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,380
- God! Kyle, no!
- Stand down!

1754
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,811
- Goddamn it!
- I said stand down!

1755
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,140
- Get his gun!
- I said stand down!

1756
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,340
- Hey!
- Call an ambulance!

1757
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,060
- Shots fired. Repeat, we've got shots fired.
- Oh, my God.

1758
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,561
What are you doin' to him?
Get him an ambulance!

1759
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,100
Get him an ambulance!
Get him an ambulance!

1760
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,580
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get off! What are you...

1761
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,380
- Room is secure!
- He can't breathe!

1762
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,323
- Hey!
- What are you doin' to him?

1763
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,844
Get him an ambulance!

1764
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,485
Hey, Kyle, you hang in there, buddy!

1765
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,166
Kyle!

1766
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,720
You hang in there, buddy.

1767
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,340
- You're good to go, pal.
- Yeah.

1768
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,441
You're all set.

1769
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,847
That kid's a nutcase.

1770
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,891
You son of a bitch.

1771
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,280
Hey, all right.

1772
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,641
- Just sit down.
- You see that? He just assaulted me.

1773
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,060
Call a cop.

1774
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,161
You got a pulse?

1775
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,046
You got anything?

1776
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,241
No, sir.

1777
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,683
Oh, my God.

1778
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,249
They shot him. Did you see that?

1779
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,045
Clear for the coroner.

1780
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,245
Copy that.

1781
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,690
This is Powell. He's been taken out.

1782
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,844
Called at 3:58 p.m.

1783
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,809
Clear it. Studio has control.

1784
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,700
Excuse me, sir. A quick question.

1785
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,962
You had the chance to leave.
Why did you stay?

1786
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,700
I was just... I was just doin' my job.

1787
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,485
You know, I don't quit
until the director tells me to.

1788
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,020
Your name is?

1789
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:55,380
My name is Lenny Libatino. It's...
it's L-E-N-N-Y, not... Not the I-E.

1790
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,970
When did you know you were in danger?

1791
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,620
I think right from the gunshot, you know,

1792
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,008
but, like I said, I was more interested
in keeping him in the frame.

1793
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,060
Maybe I should have got hair and makeup
for Lenny, huh?

1794
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,891
Host Lee Gates is recuperating
in a downtown hospital,

1795
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:14,087
along with wounded producer Ron Sprecher.
He is expected to make a full recovery.

1796
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,481
How's Ron?

1797
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,290
He's out of surgery, he's in recovery.
He's gonna be fine.

1798
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,686
Good.

1799
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,164
- What do you got there?
- Dinner.

1800
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,007
I heard you had an opening in your schedule.

1801
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,620
So this is a Friday night for you, huh?

1802
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:33,846
Yep.

1803
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,529
...thanks to this single individual.
Back to you, Sherry.

1804
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,460
The gunman's name is Kyle Budwell,

1805
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,700
24 years old, a parcel truck driver
from Queens, New York.

1806
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,140
Further details about him are still unknown
at this hour, as are concrete motives.

1807
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,940
But it's been reported
that personal financial troubles,

1808
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,980
coupled with his mother's death
six months ago,

1809
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,980
could have been contributing factors.

1810
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,084
And regulators are saying,
"Not so fast, Walt Camby."

1811
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,940
The SEC just announced
that Ibis Clear Capital

1812
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:03,362
is facing a Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act investigation.

1813
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:08,248
Violations of that act
can carry heavy criminal and civil penalties.

1814
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,820
Meanwhile, Vines of Ibis's CEO Walt Camby

1815
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,420
have quickly become an online phenomenon,

1816
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,411
variations of which have already racked up
over 10 million views online.

1817
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,250
No! No! Fuck!

1818
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,324
No! No! Fuck!

1819
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:25,140
No! No! Fuck!

1820
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:26,844
Sherry Benedict, thank you for that report.

1821
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,020
We'll come back to you later in the day
as more information emerges.

1822
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:32,180
So what the hell kind of show
are we gonna do next week?

1823
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,725
Things aren't all bad
for the Money Monster host,

1824
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,460
as viewership of Money Monster,
which had recently slid in the ratings,

1825
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,723
skyrocketed after word
of the hostage crisis spread.

1826
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,609
Lee Gates may owe that gunman
a debt of thanks.

1827
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,980
Well, it may have been an eventful afternoon

1828
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,140
outside the actual Stock Exchange,

1829
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:53,460
but it was a rather pedestrian day inside.
The Dow was down nine points, less than...

1830
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,780
NASDAQ dropped 13 points,
thanks to a shaky morning in the tech sector.

1831
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,220
Wall Street is a casino.
They're gambling with your money.

1832
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:05,060
Your company was called "a great vampire
