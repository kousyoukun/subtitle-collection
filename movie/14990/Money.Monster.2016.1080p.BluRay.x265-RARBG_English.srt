1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,736
Bells will ring
at the New York Stock Exchange

2
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,433
for another day, on this March 18th.

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,237
Okay, here we go. Are you listening?

4
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,231
Are you paying attention out there?

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,433
Good.
Because it's about to get complicated,

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,671
so I'm gonna start out slow
and make it nice and simple for you.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,351
You don't have a clue where your money is.

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,874
See, once upon a time,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,111
you could walk into your bank,
and they'd open a vault

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,350
and point to a gold brick.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,432
Not anymore.

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,398
Your money, that thing that
you bust your ass for...

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,074
It's nothing more
than a few photons of energy

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,948
traveling through a massive
network of fiber optic cables.

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,713
Why'd we do it?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,309
We did it to make it go faster.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,598
Because your money better be fast.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,511
Faster than the other guy's.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,754
But if you want faster markets
with faster trades,

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,149
faster profits, faster everything,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,956
sometimes you're gonna blow a tire.

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,508
And that is exactly what happened yesterday

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,910
at 1:07 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,270
After heavy after-hours trading,
Ibis's stock price took an historic $67...

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,510
...run by high-frequency
trading pioneer Walt Camby,

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,309
disclosed that an algorithm managing
its portfolio suddenly went haywire.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,437
The trading algorithm seems to have
experienced an unexplained anomaly.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,953
A glitch.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,918
Shares of Ibis Clear Capital
getting killed this morning.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,434
...net loss of over $800 million.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,120
- It has gone haywire.
- An algorithm...

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,336
- ...glitch...
- ...a glitch...

33
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,839
- ...glitch!
- A glitch.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,480
Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday,

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,233
but if you've been paying attention to me
for the past 16 months,

36
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,397
Walt Camby has made you a lot of money.

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,433
But if you were late to the party,
I'm not going to sugarcoat it,

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,832
you got your ass smacked yesterday.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,993
But this is only the first round.
Because this, my friend, is an opportunity.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,390
So here's what you're gonna do.

41
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,156
You're gonna stop whining,
and you're gonna get back in the ring

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,071
because this stock is coming back.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,072
You know what that means?

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,198
Let's go throw some punches.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,232
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,720
What do you mean he's ordained?

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,718
No, on a plane, Lee. A plane.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,231
All right.
That makes more sense.

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,391
Wait, Walt Camby's on a plane?

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,073
Can you pick up the pace, please?

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,056
It's like dealing with my grandmother.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,595
Come on, I'm not having a conversation
with you through the goddamn door.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,153
All right, I'll leave it open next time.

54
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,518
Wait, now, why the hell would Walt cancel?
He called me from Geneva yesterday.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,033
I don't know. He's on a plane.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,190
And how are we just
finding out about it now?

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
That is a great question.

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
You can ask him
the next time you talk to him.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,073
Here.
First one's a yes. Second one's a no.

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,832
- Mmm-hmm.
- Third one's just a signature.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,600
- Ten minutes, Mr. Gates.
- All right.

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,398
- Thanks, Gen.
- Yep.

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,519
The fill-in's name is Diane Lester.
They're setting up her remote feed now.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,797
- Who the hell is Diane Lester?
- She is the Chief Communications Officer.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,936
She wrote all the talking points anyway,
so should be fine.

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,616
When am I getting
the revisions for the opening?

67
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,790
Ah, we're making some changes on it.
Anybody seen Ron?

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,496
Might I get those before the show
or after the show?

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,456
You know the drill.
You just point the camera in my direction,

70
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,576
and we'll figure it out together.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,919
It always sounds so simple

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,456
and yet so moronic.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,976
All right. Look out,
fellas. Here we come.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,760
- Edgar Rosenthal's office called.
- Mmm-hmm.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,616
- He can't make dinner tonight.
- Thank Christ.

76
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,656
Dinner at the nursing home with my nan
is more exciting than dinner with that guy.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,136
This is the 7th reschedule.
So can I just move it to the TBD list?

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,976
Wait a minute, it's the 7th time
he's rescheduled on me?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,228
Yes, that's correct.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,216
That's ridiculous. I'm
calling him on his cell.

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,816
Well, his office said
that he's in a meeting.

82
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,673
- Hey, Freddy, nice call on the yen yesterday.
- Eat a dick, Lee.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,352
Domo arigato!

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,670
Lee, this is Diane Lester.

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,416
Alan, can you bring
the boom in for me, please?

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,431
Ed! It's Lee Iacocca.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,656
Listen, I changed my mind
on this whole retirement thing.

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,875
Turns out I want your job after all.

89
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,353
Yeah, it's Gates.

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,109
Okay. All right, I'll talk to you later.

91
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
All right.

92
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,199
So no dinner.

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,193
Lee.
Follow the noise. Diane Lester.

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,829
- Memo of, uh, talking points.
- Hello? Hello?

95
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,096
You guys at Ibis can't do anything
right these days, can you?

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,429
Look, I'm really sorry to put
you in this situation, Lee.

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,856
If it was something we could control,
believe me, we would.

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,713
I'm not the enemy here, Diane.
I'm friendly fire.

99
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
We know that.
If you read my talking points...

100
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,696
Guy's a billionaire.
He owns how many jets?

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,816
- ...Walt has already addressed the glitch...
- Five minutes!

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,456
'Cause commercial flights,
they get delayed,

103
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,696
but private ones,
they get to do whatever the hell they want.

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,315
- Ron! Where's Ron?
- I'm not sure. But here's a list of dinners...

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,675
We'll be with you in less than five, Diane.

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,354
Look at that. I wouldn't invite
any of those people to an audit.

107
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,475
Ron!

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,313
Ron. There you are.
Is that my Canadian commodities data?

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,118
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
- Mmm.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,555
Sorry, I just ran all the way
back from the Village.

111
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,030
I had a meeting with Tony Biscano
at Licem Pharmaceutical.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,519
Lee, I'll be in your ear.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,308
He gave me this.

114
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,916
- What is it?
- It's erectile cream.

115
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,356
Tony Biscano of Licem
gave you erectile cream?

116
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Yeah.

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,656
I guess I wasn't aware of the exact nature
of your relationship.

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,096
They've been testing this thing
for over a year

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,816
and the approval from the FDA
finally came in last night.

120
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,056
- Mmm-hmm.
- They're sending out a press release...

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,160
- And it works?
- Apparently, yeah. Pretty damn well.

122
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,016
- Have you tried it?
- I just got it, 30 minutes ago.

123
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,270
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- You want me to...

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,920
We're on in five minutes, aren't we?
Put it on!

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,416
Uh, Mr. Gates, you need this.
Don't forget your talking points.

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,431
Oh, yeah, yeah. Put it on my desk.

127
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,236
Okay, where is Diane Lester?

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,515
She's all checked in on remote six.

129
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,033
Who writes this shit?

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,776
- Is the graphics package loaded?
- Last one is just coming in.

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,949
Great.

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,113
We are still working off the rehearsal
script for the opening, guys.

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,256
But he didn't even stick
to the rehearsal script at rehearsal.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,776
- So, about dinner... Did you...
- Okay, you wore me down.

135
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,835
I'm sorry?

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,708
I'll go to dinner with you.
We'll go to Scalinatella's, let's say 9:30?

137
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,040
I still have a boyfriend, Lee.
Just like I did yesterday.

138
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,416
Yeah, he's still a bartender in Hoboken,
like he was yesterday.

139
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,736
- Will this work, boss?
- This is a stuffed parrot.

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,936
I said I wanted a live pigeon.

141
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,154
Patty, God damn it.

142
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,656
We don't have a live pigeon.

143
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,216
- Admit it. You're gonna miss this.
- You can't find a live pigeon?

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,550
I'm sure there are plenty of
emotionally stunted 7-year-olds

145
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,995
hosting TV shows across the street.
Thank you.

146
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Cover yourself...
Roll with yourself in breadcrumbs

147
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,216
and bring a fucking bird up here.

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,496
Jim, can you punch Diane
up on the preview for me, please?

149
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,748
Sure. There she is.

150
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,989
Patty? Patty?

151
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,231
- Hi, Diane, can you hear me?
- Uh, Yes. Yes, I can.

152
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,751
Lee has read the talking points, right?

153
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,096
Because I'm in a tough position here,

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,216
and I just want to make sure
that he sticks to the script.

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,233
He will. You know us, Diane.
We don't do "gotcha" journalism here.

156
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,629
Hell, we don't do journalism, period.

157
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,837
Scream one is up.

158
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,511
Check. Check. Check.

159
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,116
Money... Money... Money Monster.

160
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,349
About time.

161
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,960
All right, I'm ready.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,016
So, here's a novel idea.

163
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,873
How about you just pick up
some takeout on your way home.

164
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,792
Oh, God, stop. I'm getting depressed.

165
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,713
Get into your most comfortable
pair of pajamas.

166
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,355
Oh, no, no, no. This isn't really
a Friday night for you, is it? Can't be.

167
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,556
- Curl right up in front of the TV?
- Oh...

168
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,475
It's 'cause the idea of television and
pajamas and takeout, good God, it's like...

169
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,032
You get a pool cue, and I want you to
sharpen it down to a fine point.

170
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,793
And I want you to shove it
straight through my eye.

171
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,156
- Hold on a sec, Lee.
- Right into my brain.

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,376
You're killing me here, Lenny.

173
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,936
Check your mark, please.

174
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,158
You know what?
I drifted and I forgot to lock.

175
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,389
Balls.

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
That's it.

177
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,156
I would rather you do that
than sitting at home in my underwear

178
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,911
watching "Suck-My-QVC."

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Oh!

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,158
Look at the new guy.

181
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,800
Where's Leroy? Finally canned his ass.

182
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,256
One minute to air.

183
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,838
One minute. Clear the stage, please.

184
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,273
Patty, honest answer.

185
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,576
How many nights a week
do you eat dinner in your pajamas?

186
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,680
Like, on average, over the course
of my life? Or just since James left?

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,034
Listen, listen.

188
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,510
Because I haven't eaten dinner alone
since the '90s. That's hand to God.

189
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,319
Well, that's just awful.
That just makes me feel sorry for you.

190
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,799
Why do you feel sorry for me?

191
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,111
Hang on, Patty. Just one second.
Ron, you walking hard or what?

192
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,714
Oh, uh, this stuff is incredible.

193
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,519
I'm talking zero to 60 in,
like, 20 seconds flat.

194
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,868
Good, so it's a buy, then.

195
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,456
All right. Put it away and find me
a better lead for next week's show.

196
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Put it away?

197
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,616
- Lee, necklace.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

198
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,976
30 seconds to air. 30 seconds.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,035
Where's my hat?

200
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,509
Can we turn down the contrast
on her a little bit, please?

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Sure.

202
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,456
- How's that?
- That's better. Thank you.

203
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,680
- Fifteen seconds.
- Okay.

204
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,030
Here we go. Good luck, everybody.

205
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,591
- Open on VT 16.
- Ten, nine...

206
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,136
- Coming out of the opening to camera 3.
- ...eight, seven...

207
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,354
Six,

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
five,

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,515
four,

210
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,158
three, two,

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,754
- one.
- Track rollup.

212
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,833
Here he is, the wizard
of Wall Street himself, Lee Gates.

213
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,113
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

214
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,472
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

215
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,272
At the welcome mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,669
My money ain't funny
and it keep comin'...

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,468
Thank you very much.
The name is Lee Gates.

218
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,552
The show is Money Monster,

219
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,834
the day is Friday,

220
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,435
and the Dow has dropped a seismic
seven points this morning.

221
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,496
- Ready scream one.
- So what does that mean for the market...

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,669
Should you...

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,269
Ready cheer three.

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,679
- ...or should you...
- Roll.

225
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,591
And the answer is,
who cares about the Dow?

226
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,199
It's a measly 30 companies.

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,669
So why do you people
keep paying attention to it?

228
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,176
Well, probably because
our network insists on tracking it.

229
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,016
- Right here at the bottom of the screen...
- Not sticking to the script.

230
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
...in large font all day.

231
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,176
- Why does he keep talking?
- And why do they do that?

232
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,553
Sacajawea, Lee.

233
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,473
Because you people keep paying
so much attention to it.

234
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,789
Sacajawea.

235
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,349
- And the circle just keeps on turning.
- Shut up.

236
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,834
Thank you.

237
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,680
So let's try to ignore it.
Let's try to ignore it for one day.

238
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,275
One day, and talk about the thing
that everybody else is talking about.

239
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,036
Ibis Clear Capital is down another quarter
to $8.40,

240
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,032
but rather than grabbing the third rail

241
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,958
and losing control of our bowels,

242
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,474
we here at Money Monster like to go...

243
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,200
Straight to the Source!

244
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,376
Straight to the source.

245
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,836
As it turns out, Walt Camby is
35,000 feet in the air right now,

246
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,593
but we have somebody
far prettier right here at sea level.

247
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,353
It's his right-hand gal, Diane...

248
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,118
- It's Lester.
- Lester.

249
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,634
Is gonna be on the show
in a little while to explain

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,836
not only what went wrong last week,

251
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,356
but, more importantly,
what they're gonna do to fix it.

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,556
But first,
let's talk market Movers and Shakers.

253
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,198
Jim, cueclip package two and three
in case he skips one.

254
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,349
Two and three?

255
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,480
You're wondering,
"Should I sell? Should I unload?"

256
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,096
You know what I'm gonna say to you.

257
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,155
Roll balls.

258
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,113
Grow some balls, man! Man up!

259
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,754
Good one.

260
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,793
Man up! Lenny, let me hear you say it.

261
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,349
Lenny, let me hear it.

262
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,873
Look at these numbers. See these?

263
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,080
These are the stock prices
over the last three months.

264
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,394
See these drops?

265
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,616
Get used to it.
It's just the way the market works these days.

266
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,234
Look at this. $3.50 here.
Almost five bucks there.

267
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,056
If you panicked here,
you would have sold...

268
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,833
- Who's that guy?
- Who's what guy?

269
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,115
- ...you whiners, you chickens.
- Camera 2.

270
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,776
You know what I'm gonna tell you to do.

271
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,473
Mark, can you pan over?
Do you see that guy?

272
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,638
We're talking about 89% return.

273
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,456
Even the Teamsters get excited
about these numbers.

274
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,789
Somebody didn't tell me something.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,319
Looks like a delivery guy.

276
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,473
Say it. I'm not gonna
move until you say it.

277
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,391
- Balls.
- Balls!

278
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,072
There it is! Just under the wire.

279
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,869
All right. Now, for the rest of you,
you know what that means.

280
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,390
It's time for today's
"Can't Miss Stock Tip of the Millennium."

281
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,056
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium.

282
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,149
Telecommunications.

283
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,816
Forget the top-rated stocks.

284
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,592
Well, here he comes.

285
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay, Mark, stay with this guy.
I don't know who he is.

286
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,232
Alan, there's no chance he's miked,
so just boom him in.

287
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Let's see what happens.

288
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,080
Hopefully you've been listening
to our little birdy.

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,031
Where's that stupid parrot?

290
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,439
You got a delivery?

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,838
- Don't move.
- What the hell?

292
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,519
Is this a union thing?

293
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,955
Oh, Jesus!

294
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,439
Cut the feed.

295
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,873
Turn those cameras back on!

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,275
- Turn those cameras back on!
- Jesus Christ!

297
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,320
Whoever's in there,
turn those cameras back on, right now!

298
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,456
- I can't. Once I turn them off...
- You're lying!

299
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,776
Turn the cameras back on
or I'm gonna shoot him in his head!

300
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,756
Turn the cameras on, Patty! Turn them on!

301
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Patty?

302
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,955
Patty!

303
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,480
All right, I'm gonna count to three,

304
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,016
- then I swear to God...
- Do something!

305
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,216
- ...I'm pulling this trigger. One...
- Patty!

306
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,560
Patty, what do you want me to do?

307
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,039
- Turn them on, Patty!
- Two...

308
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,673
- Patty!
- Three!

309
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,637
- What do you want me to do?
- Put it up.

310
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,719
Are we live?

311
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,872
Yeah, we're live.

312
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,456
All right, turn the cameras off again

313
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,056
I'm gonna shoot him in his head.
You hear me?

314
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,149
Everybody understands.

315
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,856
- Don't try any tricks with the monitors.
- Call security.

316
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,996
I got the whole broadcast here on my phone.

317
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,595
If I see anything other than us,
I'm gonna shoot him in his head, all right?

318
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,096
- Do you understand me?
- Everybody understands you.

319
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,496
Everybody understands.

320
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,999
We stay on the air. All right.

321
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,230
- We're staying on the air.
- Good.

322
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,275
Good.

323
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
No, wait.

324
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,720
He's not picking up.

325
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
- Okay.
- Pick a box.

326
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
What do you mean?

327
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,416
- I said, "Pick a box."
- What happens if I pick the wrong box?

328
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,509
I said pick one!

329
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,080
- I'm not picking a fucking box!
- Did he say "fucking" on air?

330
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,076
Are you fucking kidding?
Call fucking security!

331
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,509
Hi, there's a guy with a gun in studio 3.

332
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,352
It sounds like a real cute stunt today.

333
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Would you turn on the goddamn TV?
It's not a stunt this time.

334
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,828
- I need help. Help me, help me.
- Jesus!

335
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,776
Stupid son of a bitch.

336
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,792
Pick a goddamn box, Lee. Come on!

337
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,039
Come on, Lee.

338
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,279
Do it!

339
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,633
That's right. Open it up.

340
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,119
Jesus Christ.

341
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,554
Now, pick it up.

342
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,234
Yep. Take it out.

343
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,153
- Now put it on.
- How do I know it won't blow up?

344
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,350
'Cause I have the detonator. All right?

345
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,997
If my thumb comes off this trigger,
then we all explode.

346
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,920
- What if your thumb gets tired?
- You better hope it doesn't.

347
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,479
Now put it on.

348
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,268
Quickly!

349
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,896
- Okay, listen up, everybody.
- Put it on.

350
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,072
If you're not manning a camera
or a boom, get out right now.

351
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,833
Stop what you're doing.

352
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,549
If you're not core-one control room,
get going.

353
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,756
Don't look up. Just go.

354
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,989
Right now.

355
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,999
Button it up.

356
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,989
Good.

357
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,754
Sit down.

358
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,999
Something's wrong.

359
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,752
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe, Lee.

360
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,239
I can't catch my breath.

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,835
Just stay calm. Don't panic.
You can breathe.

362
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,960
I'm having a heart attack.

363
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,456
- Do I look stupid to you?
- You are not having a heart attack.

364
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,789
- Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

365
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,189
- Just breathe.
- Oh, God.

366
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,056
- Patty, I'm gonna fucking die.
- No, you're not.

367
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,416
You're not gonna die, dipshit.
Not yet.

368
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,376
- Fuck you! I'm having a fucking heart attack.
- You're not having a heart attack.

369
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,656
- You're having a panic attack.
- How do you know?

370
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,399
'Cause it happens to me all the time.
Here, drink some water.

371
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,799
That's not water.

372
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,390
Lee, I want you to hear my voice.
I'm right here.

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,233
Just keep breathing.

374
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,391
Shots have been fired at FNN

375
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,816
- on the set of Money Monster with Lee Gates.
- Bring it here.

376
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,876
An intruder found his
way into the studio...

377
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,475
Turn on FNN, Money Monster.
Lee Gates has been taken hostage.

378
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,229
Shit.

379
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,072
- Shut those doors!
- Okay. Okay.

380
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,079
I see you.

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,634
Hey! Get out of there!
Nobody goes in the booth, all right?

382
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,320
Nobody's leaving from here on out.

383
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,669
Anybody tries anything stupid,

384
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,352
and I start shooting.

385
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,636
All right? I'm in charge.

386
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,960
You! Stay still. Stop fucking moving.

387
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,958
I got something I wanna say.

388
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,416
Patty, what do you want me to do?

389
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,896
Wanna make sure I get time to say it.

390
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,955
Follow him.

391
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
All right.

392
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,870
I want everyone to know something.

393
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,395
I might be the one with the gun here,

394
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,552
but I'm not the real criminal.
It's people like these guys!

395
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,952
They're stealing everything from us
and they're getting away with it, too.

396
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,629
Nobody's asking how. Nobody's asking why.

397
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,310
- I didn't steal anything from you.
- Shh!

398
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,711
Be quiet, Lee.

399
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,149
You got to open your eyes out there.

400
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,470
It's not like the government's no help.

401
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,751
How they just look the other way,
since after they're done stealing our money,

402
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,479
they barely even have
to pay any taxes on it!

403
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,755
I'm telling you, it's rigged.
The whole goddamn thing.

404
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,071
They're stealing
the country out from under us.

405
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,437
Not the Muslims. Not the Chinese. Them.

406
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,593
- Let me ask you this...
- Shut up, Lee! Shut the fuck up!

407
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Shut up!

408
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,388
I came here to talk!
Shut up for two minutes.

409
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
All right. Okay.

410
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,272
Jesus Christ.

411
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,678
It's all fixed.

412
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,435
They like how the math adds up,
so they got to keep rewriting the equation.

413
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,040
Which means, the one time you finally
get a little extra money,

414
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,310
you try and be smart about it,
you turn on the TV.

415
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,989
Boom.

416
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,872
That's how they fucking take it.

417
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,472
They take it so fast
they don't even have to explain it!

418
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,791
They literally own the airwaves.

419
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,794
They literally control the information.
But not today.

420
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,313
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything, Lee.

421
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,550
This has everything to do
with the both of you.

422
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,154
That's why I'm here. Don't you understand?

423
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,232
Two boxes.

424
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,472
Two assholes.

425
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Two?

426
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,675
Two.

427
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,435
You didn't just come here for me.

428
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,399
This is about Ibis.

429
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
- Goddamn right, this is about Ibis.
- Okay, I get it.

430
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,148
Turn that camera off.

431
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,389
Turn the camera off.

432
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,719
You lost a lot of money.

433
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,597
You went on TV. You said it was safe.

434
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,238
Four weeks ago. You stood right there.

435
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,960
This is what you did. "Let's get into this."

436
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,118
- "Oh, Ibis! Safer than a savings account!"
- I didn't say that.

437
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,949
"Home run after home run...
Oh, Walt Camby!"

438
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,296
- I didn't do that!
- Don't fucking lie, Lee! That's what you said.

439
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,016
I did recommend it, but I never said
it was safer than a savings account.

440
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,336
You want to bet? Come on, let's bet.

441
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,656
You said it was safer
than my savings account.

442
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,511
- I would never say it.
- Come on. Let's bet.

443
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,496
March the 6th, it was the Stock
Pick of the Millennium. March the 6th.

444
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,114
I make a stock pick every single day.
That's a fucking joke.

445
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,031
You got the tapes back there, right?

446
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Fuck off.

447
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Find it.

448
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,277
- March the 6th show.
- We do five shows a week.

449
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Find them!

450
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,199
How many people are inside?

451
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,552
A floor manager, a sound engineer,

452
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,110
and three cameramen on the main floor.

453
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,679
And the director, Patty Fenn.

454
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,672
And five tech guys
in the enclosed control room.

455
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,637
Okay, ESU will be here momentarily.

456
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,631
So, we're gonna need
schematics on the building.

457
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,995
Catwalks, exits, entrances,
the whole shebang.

458
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Got it.

459
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,754
Vasquez?

460
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,912
If that's Semtex,
it's enough for a fireball 50-feet from center.

461
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,718
I got a line to the control room yet?

462
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,958
Evacuate the rest of the building.
Once it's swept, nobody in or out.

463
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,519
Come on. Let's go.

464
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,909
Shuttle, shuttle, shuttle.

465
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,877
Diversify, diversify, diversify.

466
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,110
Freeze. There it is. Okay, we've got it.

467
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,437
- Roll it, Jim.
- Rolling.

468
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,034
There it is! That's it.

469
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,240
Let's settle this right now.

470
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,438
At the welcome mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash

471
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,433
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

472
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Whoo!

473
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,478
The name is Lee Gates.
The show is Money Monster.

474
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,393
The day is Friday, March 6th.
Let's get right to it.

475
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,496
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium!

476
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,796
Let's see what old
lucky one-arm has for us today.

477
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,714
Ibis Clear Capital.

478
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,360
I know, I've talked this one up before,
but what can I tell you?

479
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,313
I'm in love.

480
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,958
This is Ibis's stock
since it went public 11 months ago.

481
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,350
Look at those curves. So voluptuous.

482
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,312
So full-figured!

483
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,152
I'm genuinely attracted to it.

484
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,554
Not sexually so much,

485
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,976
although after half a dozen vodka tonics
I could talk myself into pretty much anything.

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,357
No. I am in love with this intellectually.

487
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,272
Because Ibis is run
by a man named Walt Camby.

488
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,272
Walt was one of the first guys
to tap into the true market potential

489
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,920
of high-frequency trading.

490
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,918
Look at this.
Home run after home run after home run.

491
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,639
And now he has finally gone public.

492
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,633
Folks, there isn't a better bet out there.
Not bonds, not IRAs,

493
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,216
not your savings account.

494
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,515
None of them are as safe as Walt Camby.

495
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,193
Cut it, Jim.

496
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,616
Patty, put the numbers back up there.
Give me another fix.

497
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,560
Come on.
Oh, my God, I'm going weak in the knees.

498
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,896
- I was exaggerating to make a point.
- You lost a bet, Lee.

499
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,718
I made a bad call.
How much are you into Ibis for?

500
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,119
Sixty grand.

501
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,672
Sixty grand? This is about sixty grand?

502
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,432
Pocket change to you, right?

503
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,432
Yeah, it kind of is. Okay, look.

504
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,433
You give me five minutes,
and I can get you 60 grand in cash here,

505
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
and I can make you whole.

506
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
- That won't make me whole.
- All right. What's a number that will?

507
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,112
$800 million.

508
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,416
It's gonna take me a little longer
to get $800 million here, pal.

509
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,352
That's how much went
fucking poof into thin air, you dumb shit.

510
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,432
So that's what you owe us. 'Cause I'm not
the only one watching your show.

511
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,576
I'm not the only shareholder
who got screwed over here.

512
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,936
You're the only shareholder
here with a gun.

513
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,430
You think you're fucking funny, Lee, huh?
Is this funny to you?

514
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,999
Lee, don't provoke him.

515
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,471
You must think I'm so stupid.

516
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,510
Trying to fucking buy me off.

517
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,232
I'm not stupid, Lee.

518
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,311
I walked in here knowing there was only
one way this show was gonna end.

519
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,392
I came in here knowing I'm not walking out.

520
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,348
Sit down.

521
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,149
Sit down.

522
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,549
Where the hell is ESU?
And where's my negotiator?

523
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,392
Negotiator's two minutes out.

524
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,656
- Patty Fenn.
- This is Captain Marcus Powell.

525
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
The network confirmed
you can stay live on the air.

526
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Just keep stalling him.

527
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,976
What do you mean "keep stalling"?

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,136
Tell him to say whatever it is this guy
wants to hear until we put a plan in place,

529
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,856
whatever it takes to keep him
from setting off that bomb.

530
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,915
Oh, Jesus.

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,035
Fuck off.

532
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,511
Lee?
You have to keep stalling.

533
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,592
Just keep talking to him.

534
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,355
You're good at that. So just keep talking.

535
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,313
Talk.

536
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,156
Listen, I get it. What happened at Ibis is...
It's a disaster, there's no other word for it.

537
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,348
I can promise you that Walt Camby

538
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,193
is as sick about this as anybody else.

539
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,517
Yeah? Is that what he told you
from his private fucking jet?

540
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,990
Listen, if anybody is gonna
bounce back from it,

541
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,277
it's Walt and Ibis.
This was an isolated incident.

542
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,016
- What's this?
- It's completely unrelated...

543
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,712
What is this? Who wrote this?

544
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,077
- Somebody from my office.
- "Diane Lester."

545
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,517
You see? This is what I'm talking about.
That's your problem.

546
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,235
You just sit there
behind their little fucking desk,

547
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,993
like their little fucking puppet,
buying into their bullshit,

548
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,056
instead of trying to figure out
what really happened.

549
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,000
You know what happened.
It was a computer glitch.

550
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,828
A glitch! A glitch!
It was a fucking glitch! A glitch!

551
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,239
Shut up about the glitch!

552
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
All right?

553
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,877
What the hell does that even mean?

554
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,712
You see, you don't even know.
I'm not stupid, Lee. I told you.

555
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,713
People just at home accepting this shit,
they're the stupid ones,

556
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,358
because somehow these clowns

557
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,193
lost $800 million overnight.

558
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,793
Overnight.

559
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,394
And nobody's even actually explained how.

560
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,393
How is something like that
even possible, huh?

561
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,392
How is that even fair?

562
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,119
How's that fair?

563
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,235
It's not a rhetorical question.
I want a fucking answer.

564
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,600
What do you want from me, man?

565
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,870
I don't run Ibis. I'm just a guy on TV.

566
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,838
No, no. Do not do that, Lee.
Do not do that.

567
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,638
You don't get to pass the buck today, Lee.

568
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,595
Not today. Not with me.

569
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,200
So, what do we know about him so far?

570
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,517
Name's Kyle Budwell.
No wants, no warrants, no priors.

571
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,716
We sent a patrol to his residence
to locate family.

572
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,711
They won't find anyone. The guy's a loner.

573
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,193
Hundred bucks says this poor shithead
either lives by himself or with his mother.

574
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,296
The real losers tend to stay home
with their mommies.

575
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,154
But, hey, do your thing.
But watch and see, the guy's a loner.

576
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,355
Yes.

577
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,149
Can you patch this line directly into
the studio PA system for us, please, Patty?

578
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,390
- We have a negotiator here.
- Okay.

579
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,836
Charlie? Patch this line
into the PA system, please. Right now.

580
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,151
It's all about...

581
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,912
It's high-frequency trading. It can...

582
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
Let us know when we're on.

583
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,992
Can he hear me?

584
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,910
This is Oscar Nelson.
I'm a veteran negotiator with the NYPD.

585
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,797
No. I don't want to talk to no cops.

586
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,632
Don't think of me as a cop.

587
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,478
Hey, what'd I just say? No cops!

588
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,351
Cut the line! Cut it.

589
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,475
I can handle it myself.

590
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,709
Anybody comes on that mike,

591
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,016
you gonna put a bullet in his head.
You hear me?

592
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,256
- Cut the line. Cut it.
- Cut the line, Charlie. Right now.

593
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,157
Do not cut this...

594
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,195
Two people I came here to talk to.
Him and Walt fucking Camby.

595
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,136
All right, well, then let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

596
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,976
All right, so let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

597
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,070
Right. Exactly.
Throw him under the bus.

598
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,072
Look, he was supposed to be here today.
He didn't show up.

599
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,276
- It's his company. It's his crash.
- Uh-huh.

600
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,952
So let's see what he has to say.

601
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,189
Right. Yes.

602
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,470
- What happened to the Ibis feed?
- I have no idea.

603
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,736
God damn it.

604
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,829
All right, find me Bree.

605
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,376
Have her call Diane Lester
back on the phone.

606
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,760
I want her back up on that screen.

607
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,912
And find out everything and anything
you can about Ibis Clear Capital.

608
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,479
- Got it.
- Yes, what is it?

609
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,016
I want the PA system available
in case we need to speak to him again.

610
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,376
Oh, right.
Because it worked so well the first time.

611
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,231
Look, just make sure you answer this phone.

612
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,788
We'll be right downstairs
exploring means of extraction.

613
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,029
I have Patty Fenn from Money Monster
on line three.

614
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,157
Marta, when is he landing?

615
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,152
I don't even know which plane he's on,
so I've no way of tracking him.

616
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,390
He took the G-V to Geneva on Tuesday,

617
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,994
but then he sent that to Hong Kong
to pick up Harvey Bergan.

618
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,039
Last location I have for the Learjet
was, uh, Sao Paulo on Monday.

619
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,516
Monday? That's four days ago.

620
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,576
You know how he is with his planes.
When he's in the air, he's off the grid.

621
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,696
Are you telling me that until he lands,
whenever the hell that may be, that he's...

622
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,349
He's completely unreachable.
Which makes this one big clusterfuck.

623
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,635
I have Patty Fenn on hold.
What should I tell her?

624
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,760
She'll call back.

625
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,115
Come on.

626
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,096
Diane Lester's office
is giving me the runaround.

627
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Okay, Bree.

628
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,435
Dave, I need an address for Ibis, ASAP.

629
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,034
And, Bree, try Dan Issa at the SEC.

630
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,440
They've got to be
sniffing around this train wreck already.

631
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,312
Keep stalling, Lee. We're on it.

632
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,552
Lenny, can you come around on this guy?
I'm losing him in a little shadow.

633
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,029
- You kidding me?
- Just move in.

634
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,313
What the hell are you doing?

635
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,756
Director wanted
a better angle on your face.

636
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,159
There's kind of a...

637
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,233
A little shadow.

638
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,995
"A little shadow"?

639
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,993
Patty, "A little shadow"?

640
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,469
He could have killed you
much easier off camera, Lee.

641
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,710
There's a reason
he's interrupted you on live TV.

642
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,080
Look, give me a break, guy.
I'm just trying to do my job.

643
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,991
They tell me to move in, I move in.

644
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,151
All right, where do you want to go?

645
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,056
Well, if you went over there,
it would be good.

646
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,593
- Here?
- Yeah.

647
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,593
See, I'm directing a show back here,
which means you're hosting one up there.

648
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,671
So start hosting.

649
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,830
Okay, first things first.

650
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,635
- What's your name?
- Oh, don't worry about my name.

651
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
You're on TV. Trust me.

652
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,816
They're gonna know your Little League batting
average by the time this is through.

653
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,832
His name is Kyle Budwell.
The cops already tracked down his info.

654
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,040
Doesn't even have to be your real name.
Just give me anything I can call you.

655
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,191
Fine. Call me Kyle.

656
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,712
Okay, Kyle.

657
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,509
Got the address.

658
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,536
All right, that's midtown.
Listen, Ibis is ducking our calls.

659
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,393
I say we send somebody there
in person instead.

660
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,988
- All right.
- Alan, see if you can put a mike on this guy.

661
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,548
Lee, talk him through this.
I don't want him spooked.

662
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,392
- Kyle, listen.
- Yeah.

663
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,311
This is Alan. He's our sound guy.

664
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,456
He wants to put a microphone on you...

665
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,400
- Whoa!
- So you can... No, it's okay. It's okay.

666
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,391
You want people
to be able to hear you, right?

667
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,597
- Why, they couldn't hear me before?
- They could... This will be better.

668
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,536
We're tracking down Ron now.
I'm gonna put him on the air with you.

669
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,629
- Kyle.
- Yeah?

670
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,995
I'm gonna send one of my guys
over to Ibis's office

671
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,389
and see if they can
get some answers in person.

672
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,314
We've got a producer.
This kid's name is Ron.

673
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,752
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

674
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,234
- Christ!
- Oh, my God!

675
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,197
Ron! This stuff really works!

676
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,714
- What's the stock trading at?
- $4.25.

677
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,994
Christ!

678
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,389
Shit, shit, shit. Shit. My phone.

679
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,790
No, it's okay.
I need a break anyway.

680
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Hold on.

681
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,279
- Uh, yeah?
- Hang on, Ron.

682
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Hey, Charlie.

683
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,136
Hi, Ron.
I'm gonna put you on the air with Lee.

684
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,275
Lee, you've got Ron.

685
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,496
- Uh...
- Patching Ron in.

686
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,576
What do you mean
you're putting me on the air?

687
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
You're going on the air?

688
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,840
- Who is that? Where are you?
- Um...

689
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,117
I'm in my office with, um, Arlene.

690
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,679
Who'd you just tell my name to?

691
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,600
Is that Arlene from Product Placement?

692
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,239
Get off my jeans.

693
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
I thought you said the
building was cleared.

694
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,120
It was. We walked every floor.

695
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,593
Uh, so, what's up, Lee?

696
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,279
Hey, are you coming back?

697
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,793
Where are you right now?

698
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,997
Oh, I've just been, uh,
going through tapes for tomorrow,

699
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,356
uh, but everything looks good,
so I think we should be in good shape, so...

700
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,635
Holy shit! That guy has a gun!

701
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,678
Imagine my surprise.

702
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,877
Now, do us a favor and get your ass
down to Ibis Clear Capital,

703
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,109
would you, please?

704
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Uh, okay.

705
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,816
I like when he has the strippers on.

706
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Right. Right. Sure.

707
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,376
- Don't be a schmuck, Ron. Get moving.
- Is this for real?

708
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,440
Hey, turn it up, will you?

709
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,176
There's a van and a crew
waiting downstairs for you.

710
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,880
Let's go. Come on. Move.
You should be downstairs already. Let's go!

711
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,553
What's taking them so long?

712
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,871
It's midday traffic.
What are you gonna do?

713
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,314
Got it.

714
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,111
So the home address is outdated.

715
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,360
The family that's in there now
bought it six months ago

716
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,598
from the estate of one Clara Budwell,
a 62-years-old deceased woman.

717
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,296
Ah! Mama's boy. What'd I tell you?

718
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,616
We tracked down the escrow company.

719
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,600
They confirmed all the money from the sale
went to her son. Guess how much?

720
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
Sixty grand.

721
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,856
It's a good thing you didn't bet me, pal,
since he fits the profile to a fucking T.

722
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,616
There has to be a current address
with the escrow company.

723
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,696
Somewhere they sent the check to.

724
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,656
- There is, but we need a subpoena to get it.
- Captain.

725
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,477
Get somebody
down to the courthouse, ASAP.

726
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,471
Judge Reiner. He'll expedite.

727
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
All right.

728
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,536
We can try to gain access
through catwalks here

729
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,836
or a crawlspace here, and get them out
through the hatch in the control room here.

730
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,196
First, we save the hostages.
Second, we take out the psycho.

731
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,912
Okay, we're here.
Just, uh, give us a minute to get set up.

732
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,376
We've got Ron. I'm putting him up.

733
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Okay, here we go.

734
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,391
We've got Ron Sprecher
reporting from outside...

735
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,136
As if this month
couldn't get any worse.

736
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,673
Ron, Ron, can you hear us?

737
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,558
I'm here outside Ibis Clear Capital,
where their CEO...

738
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,234
Security, there's a man down there
with a camera crew.

739
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,656
Make sure he doesn't get in the building
under any circumstances.

740
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,193
What did Teterboro say, Marta?

741
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,159
I gave them the tail numbers
of both of these planes,

742
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,673
no communication with either.

743
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,278
Okay, I'm gonna down there
and try and buy us some time.

744
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,376
I mean, obviously,
this guy just wants some answers.

745
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
So do we.

746
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,750
If we knew how we lost $800 million,
we wouldn't have lost $800 million.

747
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,229
I get that, Avery,
but we still have to say something.

748
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,216
Come on. You know Walt. He's an open book.
I know if he was here...

749
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,310
But he's not here, Diane. He's not here.

750
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,836
Okay, we can't just lock ourselves away
here and do nothing and hope it disappears.

751
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,176
We are a publicly-traded company.

752
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,216
We've got shareholders.
We've got a board of directors

753
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,630
and we've got a CEO, even though
we don't know where he is right now.

754
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,616
So, look,
I'm happy to have this conversation again

755
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,712
when Walt lands,
but until then, it's not our call to make.

756
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,714
So, he's got
the stage all locked up.

757
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,075
These are the exits, front and rear.

758
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,309
Now, the problem is,

759
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,153
this guy's got complete range of vision
throughout the entire studio.

760
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,914
So our only chance for a clean shot

761
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,718
is from these catwalks above the stage.

762
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,760
We're putting a man in position there
as we speak.

763
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,909
What about the bomb?

764
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,230
This is definitely a dead man's switch
here in his hand,

765
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,756
which means, if you take him out
without disarming the bomb first... Kaboom.

766
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,136
Got the warrant, got an address.
Sending a patrol there now.

767
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Great.

768
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,496
You see this bulge right here?
That's the wireless receiver.

769
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,976
Now, Captain, if we can destroy that,

770
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,355
then the dead man's switch
is just another fucking switch.

771
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,433
Except, in order to destroy it,
we got to what, shoot Gates?

772
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,193
That's where this guy slipped up.

773
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,656
If he wanted to ensure a kill shot,

774
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,672
he should've put the receiver here,
right over the poor bastard's heart.

775
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,269
But instead, he put it down here
next to his left kidney.

776
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,275
If the bullet's on target, we get to him
quick enough to avoid too much blood loss,

777
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,176
there's a good chance, Captain,
he could survive it.

778
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,315
I'm sorry.

779
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,709
Are you proposing
we shoot the star of a TV show

780
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,268
live, on air, in front
of millions of people?

781
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,713
Yeah.

782
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,936
I need you to talk to somebody
from Ibis Clear Capital.

783
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,736
I need to talk... You wanna touch me?

784
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,479
- Don't put your hands on me.
- Andre? It's okay.

785
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,856
- That's, that's, uh...
- Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.

786
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,536
Do you have an earpiece
so I can hear everyone?

787
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,696
- Uh, yes. Yeah.
- Okay, good.

788
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,835
- Come on.
- All right.

789
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,515
Uh, we're gonna talk to Diane Lester.
She's the PR lady. She's the, uh...

790
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
CCO.

791
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,114
...Chief Communications Officer at Ibis.
Diane?

792
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,829
Okay, get ready to put her on screen two.
We're gonna put her on screen two.

793
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,096
We're ready when you are.

794
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,439
And go, Jim.

795
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,353
- Here she comes.
- All right.

796
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,874
First, let me start off by saying

797
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,520
on behalf of everyone here at Ibis,

798
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,633
we are prepared to do whatever we can to
get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.

799
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,456
Now, I understand that
you've offered to compensate him

800
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,232
for his losses personally, Lee.

801
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,075
Well, we are absolutely willing to do the
same if it helps put an end to all this.

802
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,716
Allright, you walk away now,
double your money.

803
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,313
She knows my last name.

804
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,474
Everybody in the five boroughs
knows your last name by now, Kyle.

805
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,429
Uh...

806
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,397
No, it's too late for your money, lady.

807
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,360
All I want from you is an answer.
I just wanna know what really happened?

808
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,630
Oh, goddamn it!

809
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,638
Well, the truth is

810
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,038
we don't know.

811
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,839
We don't know why the algo
suddenly went haywire.

812
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,031
And we don't know why the fail-safes
built to prevent...

813
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,840
God, I really hope she has
more to say than "We don't know."

814
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,678
We just don't know.

815
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,593
Are you kidding?
This is all she's got? Are you kidding me?

816
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,238
Sacajawea.

817
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,034
Fine.

818
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,032
Are you watching this?
This is getting out of control.

819
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,696
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get
after this idiot blows himself up

820
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,551
is going to be unbelievable.

821
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,520
You thought it was bad before?
It's about to get 100 times more intense.

822
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,075
Look, don't worry, okay? We can handle it.
Gates is an idiot.

823
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,038
Just stay the course, okay?
I'm working Mambo night and day.

824
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,597
I would like to point out
that this affected all of us.

825
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,878
All our board, our managers,
including myself.

826
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,679
Our pensions were depleted overnight.

827
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,268
- Diane.
- Our savings gutted just like yours.

828
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,554
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

829
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,136
Are you trying to make
me feel sorry for you?

830
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,230
Is that really what's happening right now?

831
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,176
- No, I just...
- That's exactly what's happening.

832
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,800
I understand you want specifics.

833
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,350
Yeah. So why doesn't
she give him some specifics?

834
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,948
We know this was
a completely isolated incident.

835
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,837
It's what we call a black swan.

836
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,959
It's impossible to predict,
but it's impossible to replicate.

837
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,632
" Black swan"?

838
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,789
That's her memo.

839
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,518
She's reading from her memo.

840
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,596
Diane. Diane.
We both read your talking points.

841
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,434
He doesn't want some PR spin about
what's gonna go right next year.

842
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,273
He wants an explanation
for what went wrong last week.

843
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Yeah.

844
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,155
Right, I understand.
And we believe in complete transparency.

845
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,639
That's why we disclosed...

846
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,736
Where are your quants, Diane?
Where are your quants?

847
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,957
- That's good. Go with that. Get an answer.
- I'm sorry?

848
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,176
- Yeah.
- The quants you used.

849
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,839
The guy who actually designed
the algorithm that crashed.

850
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,912
Where is he?
Is he in that building right there behind you?

851
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,616
'Cause I think
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

852
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,473
No, um, these are our administrative offices.
Our quants aren't...

853
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,710
Okay, then where is he? Is he in Mumbai?

854
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,840
Russia? Yeah, he's in Russia.
They're all in Russia.

855
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,915
I'm not sure.

856
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,376
But if you'd like to talk to someone,
then I can make that happen.

857
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,392
No, I don't want to talk to
some low-level schlub, God damn it.

858
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,152
I want an explanation from you!

859
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,391
And if you can't give me one,
then I want to talk to Walt Camby.

860
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,993
No, I'm sorry,

861
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,116
- but Walt is on a plane right now.
- God damn...

862
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,311
Shit-fucking assholes.

863
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,029
I'm getting so tired of this same old
bullshit over and over again, Lee.

864
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,792
- Wait.
- Don't tell me to wait!

865
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
What happened?

866
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,876
He just shot out your monitor on the stage

867
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,394
because you're giving him
the same corporate bullshit!

868
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,896
I'm not.

869
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,936
You have to understand
how delicate of a situation this is.

870
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,509
I'm sitting 80-feet from a bomb!
Don't talk to me about delicate situations!

871
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,989
You have got to wake up
and do the math here,

872
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,957
because it is not adding up to me, either.

873
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,598
Why is that so goddamn hard?

874
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,896
Sorry, what do you mean?

875
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,673
I mean, you better ask some real questions

876
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,830
and get some real answers,
and hurry the fuck up!

877
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,536
I want what happened to make sense!

878
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,597
Do not talk to him like that.
Do not tell him things.

879
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,796
- Right now!
- Don't do anything stupid.

880
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,016
Let me get you some answers.

881
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,016
You need to bargain for more time.
All right?

882
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,136
- Trade something.
- Give me 10 more minutes.

883
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,639
Bargain with him.

884
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,432
Kyle, look.

885
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,637
You give me something,
I give you something. Okay?

886
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,109
That's how this works.

887
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,515
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

888
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,159
Come on.

889
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,752
Give me a chance.

890
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,318
Let me figure this out.

891
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,956
- Fine, you got 10 minutes.
- Okay. All right.

892
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,473
Now what?

893
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,597
I made myself extraordinarily clear
that you were not to go on camera.

894
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,229
You know, I am curious.
Who actually did design that algo?

895
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,833
Why don't we call him together?

896
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,876
Now, you listen to me, Diane. You're a CCO.

897
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,155
And that is all you are
and that is nothing.

898
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,576
I've seen a dozen girls
like you come and go.

899
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,736
- Really? Girls like me?
- Yeah!

900
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,896
I don't have to stand
here and listen to this.

901
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,117
- Well, you're fired, Diane!
- You can't fire me. I don't report to you.

902
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,272
It's not our job to bail out this psychopath!
Do not walk away from me!

903
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,112
I don't report to you, Avery.

904
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,353
Ryan, get me a list of every quant that's
been on our payroll since we went public.

905
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,352
Walt's G-V radioed Teterboro.
Twenty minutes out.

906
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,398
Have a car waiting downstairs for me.
And get me that list.

907
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,716
This is Eagle One
in first position. Proceeding to two.

908
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,192
Bree, I asked for Dan Issa
from the SEC.

909
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,390
I called twice and left word both times.

910
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,754
All right, get me Ron.

911
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,869
Ron, I need you to go down
to the SEC's offices on Vesey Street.

912
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,600
Find Dan Issa. Do not take no for an answer.
You have nine minutes.

913
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Nine minutes?

914
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,598
- Vesey Street's over a mile away.
- Then you better start running now.

915
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,630
Hey, Dave, can you pull up a stock
price graphic for Ibis for me, please?

916
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,156
- Okay. I'll need a second.
- Okay, then put their logo up on the nine-by.

917
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Okay.

918
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,676
Lee? How many people do you think
are tuned into us right now at this moment?

919
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,513
Millions probably? Tens of millions?

920
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,672
That's tens of millions of investors,

921
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,957
all with their fingers
on their E-trade accounts.

922
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,559
Kyle, you bought Ibis at what, $75 a share?

923
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,950
- Yeah. So?
- What if we can get it back there?

924
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,513
How many times I gotta tell you,
it's too late for your money.

925
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,839
You're not the only shareholder
that got screwed over.

926
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,590
You came here because you had something
that you wanted to say.

927
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,256
You want people
to finally listen to you, right?

928
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Yeah.

929
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,038
Well, now they can.

930
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,793
- Logo's ready.
- Put it up on the big screen.

931
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,791
All right, Lee. Go to work.

932
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,438
Watch what we can do.

933
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,136
I want to talk to everybody out there.

934
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,594
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

935
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,716
And here's what I want you to do.

936
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,552
I want you to go to your computer

937
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,791
and I want you to buy Ibis stock.

938
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,472
I'm gonna be upfront with you.

939
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,536
I don't want you to do it
because you're gonna make money.

940
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,073
I want you to do it

941
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,711
because it'll save my life.

942
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,150
This is ballsy.

943
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,154
The old Money Monster bump.

944
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,470
The old Money Monster bump
on a massive scale.

945
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,216
- Where's my stock price?
- Just got it up.

946
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,708
It's simple math. Value comes from demand.

947
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,712
So if every single one of you
buys a few shares,

948
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,696
then we can get the price
of this sucker up in no time.

949
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,472
And here's the crazy part.

950
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,233
If we do it and everybody invests
just a little bit of money,

951
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,675
the price starts to go up.

952
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,753
And then the algorithms... They start to
take notice, and they start to buy it.

953
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,120
Give it to me on the big screen.

954
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,116
If you can fool them,
then the sky's the limit!

955
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,988
Which means that together we can turn
a bad investment into a good one

956
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,356
by sheer force of will.

957
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,509
Nice.

958
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,431
So, as of right now,

959
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,479
I am moving Ibis from a sell to a buy.

960
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,518
He's gonna call a triple.
Ready triple. Roll it.

961
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,669
...and make it a rare...

962
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,077
...Triple Buy!

963
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,870
Come on. Come on.

964
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,475
Come on, you son of a bitch.

965
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,988
Come on, guys.

966
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,719
We're human beings, we're not computers.

967
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,958
We have a conscience.

968
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,992
Refresh, refresh.

969
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,718
- There it is.
- Yeah.

970
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,233
$8.48.

971
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,320
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

972
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,228
We take care of each other.

973
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,594
It's embedded in our DNA.

974
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:17,670
Not because an equation tells us to,
but because we feel it in here.

975
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,955
And right now, I need your help.

976
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,953
This looks promising.

977
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,359
We can do the right thing.

978
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,439
But we have to do it together.

979
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,358
Come on. Refresh, refresh.

980
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,456
So, I'm talking to every one of you.

981
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,836
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

982
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,749
I want you to dig as deep as you can

983
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,914
and I want you to ask yourself,
what is a life worth to you?

984
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,232
What's my life worth?

985
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,160
I guess that answers that question, huh?

986
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,190
Detective, one coming in.

987
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,031
Ma'am. Excuse me.

988
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,350
Ma'am. NYPD. You live here?

989
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,032
Yeah. What's the problem?

990
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,270
What's your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

991
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,552
Why? Where is he?

992
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,016
Where have you been all day?
If you don't mind me asking.

993
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,315
I work in a glass box underground
for eight hours a day.

994
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,496
So could you please just tell me
what the hell is going on here,

995
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,936
because you're really
starting to freak me out.

996
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,279
I'm gonna ask again.

997
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,715
What is your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

998
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,111
Why don't you take a wild guess.

999
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,155
Powell.

1000
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,071
Okay, I'll clear a path.

1001
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,234
I should've taken that bet after all,
you sack of shit.

1002
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,991
This is really impressive, Lee.

1003
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,151
I mean, talk about market influence.

1004
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,470
Do you want to know
why that shit didn't work, asshole?

1005
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,911
Because even you don't buy
your own bullshit.

1006
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,515
You believe in money.
You don't believe in people.

1007
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,750
Lee, they tracked
down his girlfriend.

1008
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,512
They don't believe in you, either.

1009
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,272
His pregnant girlfriend.

1010
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,432
- You got to be fucking joking.
- No, no joke, Lee.

1011
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,755
Uh-uh.

1012
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,075
Quant.

1013
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,390
Quantitative analytics.

1014
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,776
Look, I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

1015
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,995
Does anybody there speak English?

1016
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,229
Fuck.

1017
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,976
I need the other number
for the guy in Moscow.

1018
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,992
Yeah, but he gave me another name.
This one's based out of Seoul.

1019
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,799
God damn it. Goodloe.

1020
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,349
- Shit.
- I've got it.

1021
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,554
Go get me a phone number.
I'm gonna find a translator.

1022
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,314
Amy! Amy! Amy!

1023
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,233
Bring your security pass and come with me.

1024
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,232
Hurts, doesn't it?

1025
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,595
Got your fancy education.

1026
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,434
Got your millions in the bank.

1027
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,751
Think you got it all made.

1028
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,913
You're not such a hot shit right now, huh?

1029
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,956
You want to sit here
and take stock of our lives, Kyle?

1030
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,274
How about we compare scores, hmm?

1031
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,759
How about we do that?

1032
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,195
Touchscreen. Shit, the touchscreen.

1033
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,036
All right. We got Kyle and we got Lee.

1034
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,714
Let's start with the obvious.
Money.

1035
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,792
I got some. You don't, I gather.

1036
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,840
So, that's a point for me.

1037
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,376
Where you going with this, Lee?

1038
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,152
But then there's family.

1039
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,028
I'm divorced three times.
What about you? You got a wife?

1040
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,555
Hmm?

1041
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,789
Girlfriend, then?

1042
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,029
Sacajawea, Lee.

1043
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,954
You got a girlfriend? That's nice.
The magic of young love.

1044
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,856
I think we can both agree
that's a point for you,

1045
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,270
since the first number on my speed-dial
is an escort service.

1046
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,696
- You don't know anything about me.
- I don't need to know about you!

1047
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,429
I know about me.
Seven years, three years, 14 months.

1048
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,496
The marriages, they get shorter
and they get shorter,

1049
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,511
but settlements,
they get larger and larger.

1050
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,919
Lee?

1051
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,513
Look at me, Lee.

1052
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,112
Sacajawea.

1053
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,633
Hey, Kyle, you see her?

1054
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,429
That's Patty, my director,
and she wants me to shut up.

1055
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,551
Well, now, she's sick of me, too.

1056
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,918
And that's why she took a job
across the street and didn't tell me.

1057
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,119
People talk.

1058
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,513
They all leave sooner or later, Kyle.
That's just how it works.

1059
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,433
So trust me,
that's gonna be a point for you.

1060
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,794
What about kids?

1061
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,113
You got a kid?

1062
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
Hmm?

1063
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,917
One on the way, maybe?

1064
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,593
Yeah? She's expecting. It's a blessing.

1065
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,875
I have one myself.

1066
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,192
She must be six or seven. I have no idea.

1067
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,633
I send a check.

1068
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,712
Mazel tov on the bundle of joy.

1069
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,598
I think we can both agree
that's another fucking point for you.

1070
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,079
So, now, look at this.

1071
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,277
Kyle. Oh, my God.
We just got started and you're already ahead.

1072
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,118
Just... Just stay wide, Jim.

1073
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,749
So let me ask you something, Kyle.

1074
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,232
What about your life is so much shittier
than the rest of ours

1075
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,356
that you get to
throw in the towel early, hmm?

1076
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,799
I want to know.

1077
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,435
You got a decent job.
You got two hands and two feet.

1078
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,630
You got a goddamn kid on the way!

1079
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,392
So before you blow me to kingdom come,
I want you to answer one question.

1080
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,472
What makes you such a giant fucking failure
compared to everybody else?

1081
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,296
You really gonna stand there
in your $1,000 suit

1082
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,719
and compare scores with me?

1083
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,355
Huh?

1084
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,197
My honest job pays me $14 an hour,
you cocksucker.

1085
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,032
So let's start there.

1086
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,833
You know how far $14 an hour
gets you here in New York? Huh?

1087
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,834
You know how much of that is left after
I pay my rent and all my fucking bills?

1088
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,718
I keep paddling as hard as I can
just to stay above water.

1089
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,074
It takes everything I got!

1090
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,713
And that's before the kid gets here.

1091
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,376
How the hell am I gonna supposed to
support him, huh?

1092
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,576
How am I gonna take care of him?

1093
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,656
You'll take great care of him.

1094
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,672
He gets to grow up being the kid
whose old man blew himself up on live TV.

1095
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,856
- God damn it, Lee.
- He's the goddamn Father of the Year!

1096
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,836
Don't you fucking say
another word about my son

1097
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,956
or I'll end this right fucking now.
You hear me?

1098
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,758
- All right.
- You hear me?

1099
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,354
You want your brains splattered
all over downtown, Lee, huh?

1100
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,793
Mr. Budwell!

1101
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,313
Mr. Budwell.

1102
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,553
Yeah?

1103
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,430
Mr. Budwell, please stand by.

1104
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,669
Stand by for what?

1105
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,199
Stand by for what?

1106
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,917
Hi, Molly. I'm Marcus Powell. Come with me.

1107
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,240
You think I don't know what you're doing?

1108
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,359
I know what you're doing!

1109
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,957
Lee, we're gonna put his girlfriend
onscreen so you can talk to her.

1110
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,120
It's all a big stall.

1111
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,016
And you're gonna keep
your mouth shut until then.

1112
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,280
You hear me?
Sitting up there, trying to figure out

1113
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,477
how to keep me
from pulling this fucking trigger, huh?

1114
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,068
Well, this stupid fuck's
gonna make me shoot him in his head,

1115
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,816
and there's nothing
you can do about it, lady!

1116
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,856
Just remember our only
goal is to get him to put the weapon down.

1117
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,480
Jerking me around all fucking day.

1118
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,232
Okay, Matty, go ahead.

1119
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,079
- Okay.
- Get in there.

1120
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,830
Your 10 minutes were up a long time ago.
Hey. Hey!

1121
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,469
You fucking crazy?
What the fuck are you doing?

1122
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,949
Kyle? Are you there?

1123
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,233
Okay, circle around, circle around
so you get that girl on camera.

1124
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,548
- Kyle? Kyle?
- Molly.

1125
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,949
- Can he see me?
- Yeah, I can see you.

1126
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,880
- Yeah, he can see you.
- Yeah.

1127
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,548
- He's not... Kyle. Kyle?
- Molly.

1128
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,119
Yeah, Molly, where are you?

1129
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,035
- Are you here? Where is she?
- Kyle?

1130
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,976
- Is she outside?
- Can he hear me?

1131
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,194
- Molly?
- Kyle.

1132
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,989
Yeah?

1133
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,199
What are you doing here?

1134
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,877
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

1135
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,918
Kyle, what are you doing here?

1136
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,717
Why... I thought you were working today.

1137
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
God.

1138
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,154
You are the dumbest son of a bitch
on the planet, you know that?

1139
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,349
They told me about the money, Kyle.

1140
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,796
You are so fucking stupid.

1141
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,672
That was everything we had.

1142
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,910
That was every last cent.

1143
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,515
You are such a fucking failure, Kyle,
you know that?

1144
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,956
You have always been
such a fucking failure.

1145
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,776
- You sat down in the basement all night...
- Molly, just...

1146
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,759
...reading your fucking books, thinking you
are some kind of a smart guy, but you aren't.

1147
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,071
You fucking aren't.
And now you go and you do this?

1148
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,520
You blow all your mother's money
like some kind of a halfwit

1149
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,473
and then you come in here
with a fucking bomb?

1150
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,616
Turn it off, for Christ's sake!

1151
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,136
You hardly even know
how to use a screwdriver!

1152
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,920
That is how useless you are
around the house!

1153
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,656
And now you're going
and you're building fucking bombs?

1154
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,760
Since when did you become
such a man all of a sudden?

1155
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,753
But you're not a man.

1156
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,121
- You're a bitch. That's what you are.
- Turn it off.

1157
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,718
You hear me, Kyle? You are a bitch.

1158
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,918
You cry when we fuck,
you pasty little bitch!

1159
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,237
Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!

1160
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,736
- Don't you fucking touch her. Hey!
- I am seven months' pregnant!

1161
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,069
And fuck you, too, Kyle!

1162
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,037
This is all your fucking fault!

1163
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,838
Why don't you just get it over with

1164
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,120
and shoot yourself in the head already,
you chickenshit!

1165
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,631
Come on. Just pull the fucking trigger!
Pull the fucking...

1166
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,240
Hey.

1167
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,839
Kyle.

1168
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,630
Back off, guys. Back off a little bit.
Give us some room. Little bit.

1169
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,878
She's gone. You take a deep breath.

1170
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,273
You keep your finger on that button.

1171
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,197
You hear me, Kyle?

1172
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,521
- Give me some sign that you're hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you.

1173
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,828
Okay.

1174
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,869
Okay, here we go.

1175
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,554
Let's take a seat.

1176
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,680
Come on.

1177
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,480
Come on. That's it.

1178
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,834
Hey.

1179
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,590
It's hard to believe
you're the calm one in the relationship.

1180
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
All right.

1181
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,437
It's okay, Kyle.
We've all been there, believe me.

1182
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,432
Just take a minute.

1183
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,993
You take your time.

1184
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,196
Nobody's going anywhere.

1185
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,630
Is that him again?
Is that the quant?

1186
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,432
Translate this exactly, Amy, all right?
Tell him I need to ask him some questions

1187
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,478
and if he doesn't talk to me,
then people are going to die.

1188
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,256
Fine. Put her on.

1189
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,713
- Huh?
- Put her on.

1190
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
Alright.

1191
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,599
You speak English?

1192
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,195
Listen, lady,
I'm not getting mixed up in all this.

1193
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,750
I was hired to design a program.
My job was about data.

1194
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,040
It was about math.
It was about theoreticals. That's it.

1195
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,918
Yes, but this glitch was still a result
of a program you designed.

1196
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,673
Wrong. It's user error.

1197
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,355
They're only calling it a glitch because
nobody understands how the algo works.

1198
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,398
And if nobody can understand the math,

1199
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,630
then nobody has to explain the money.

1200
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,190
Well, that's why I'm calling you.
I want to understand.

1201
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,793
Fine.

1202
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,390
Algorithms make patterns,
they don't break them.

1203
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,392
And this algo was designed
to move in and out

1204
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,710
of hundreds of positions
in fractions of seconds.

1205
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,835
Right.

1206
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,755
What it wasn't designed to do
is consume large amounts of capital,

1207
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,956
accumulate leveraged positions or...

1208
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,510
Or hold a portfolio
for any extended period of time.

1209
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,551
Wait. What does that mean?

1210
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,551
It means

1211
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,315
there is no way that this algorithm

1212
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,716
could lose $800 million in one afternoon.

1213
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,554
It is literally a
mathematical impossibility.

1214
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,272
So whatever went wrong,
whatever investment went haywire,

1215
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,669
it's not the computer's fault.

1216
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,038
There's human fingerprints all over this.

1217
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,671
Whose fingerprints?

1218
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,151
Like I said,
I don't want to get involved in this.

1219
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,958
Is there anything you can give me?

1220
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,189
Do the math.

1221
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,273
You can't find your boss,
and he can't find $800 million.

1222
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,950
Where did you say he was coming from?

1223
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,279
What a mess, huh?

1224
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,758
I take it you've heard by now?

1225
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,398
Yeah.

1226
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,040
Goodloe started calling me
the second I turned my phone back on.

1227
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,638
He and I had a disagreement over strategy.

1228
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,392
So I heard.

1229
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,315
You did good.

1230
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,710
I'm proud of you... Whatever Goodloe says.

1231
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,716
Here, I got you some chocolate.

1232
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,158
From Switzerland.

1233
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,077
Hey, I'll take those
and put them in the back for you.

1234
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,592
That's cold.

1235
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,512
Amy, can you sit up front, please?

1236
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,318
And don't say a fucking word.

1237
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,508
She's right. She's fucking right.
She's fucking right.

1238
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,512
She's fucking right!

1239
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,070
God damn it! Jesus.

1240
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,056
Oh, God, why do you always do this?

1241
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,433
This isn't good, Lee.

1242
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,630
You're so stupid, Kyle.

1243
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,359
You're so stupid, you stupid pussy.

1244
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,877
She's fucking right.

1245
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,393
Now what?

1246
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,233
What the fuck am I fucking doing?

1247
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,639
Shit!

1248
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,311
Do not...

1249
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,548
I'll do it.

1250
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,753
You got to fucking do it.

1251
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,674
I got to fucking do it.
You stupid piece of fucking shit.

1252
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,056
What the fuck am I fucking doing?
I've got to do this.

1253
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,195
Kyle.

1254
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,475
What am I gonna do? Shoot you?

1255
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,748
I don't want to shoot you, Kyle.
I don't want you to die.

1256
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,672
What chance do I have now?

1257
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,232
There's still a way out of this.
I know there's still a way out.

1258
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,496
T ell me one reason
why I shouldn't put this gun in my mouth

1259
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,192
and pull the fucking trigger.

1260
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,510
Kyle, look at me.

1261
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,275
Hey.

1262
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,112
You made a mistake.

1263
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,350
That doesn't mean your life is over.

1264
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,272
What you need is a plan.

1265
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,191
No way any plan's gonna
help me through this.

1266
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,794
That's 'cause
you're not thinking straight.

1267
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,553
I'm willing to help you if you'll let me.

1268
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,358
Step one.

1269
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,916
This gun and this vest
is not helping anything.

1270
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,072
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Signals get crossed. Things get chaotic.

1271
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,936
Innocent people get hurt.
It happens all the time.

1272
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,873
If I let any of these
guys go then I'm dead.

1273
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,552
Jesus.

1274
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,389
Jesus.

1275
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,554
All right.

1276
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,073
We'll find another way.

1277
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,074
You got to give me some space.
I need to rethink this.

1278
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,550
Is Fox 2 in position? Make your move.

1279
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,078
A plan, Kyle.

1280
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,196
That's all we need.

1281
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,348
We just got unobstructed access,
north side studio.

1282
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,874
Repeat. Unobstructed access on the north.

1283
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,554
- Go with him. Extraction only, though.
- Sir.

1284
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,596
Do you understand?
Extraction only right now.

1285
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,556
Listen, I agree with you.
We need to get ahead of this one.

1286
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,270
And we're all about
transparency, after all.

1287
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,991
I'm the CEO, so I'm the one
who needs to make the statement.

1288
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,176
We just need to make sure it's
on our terms, not on theirs.

1289
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,838
We're all set up at Federal Hall.

1290
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,639
We have the run of the place,
we have security onsite,

1291
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,472
and no one knows you'll be going there.

1292
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,875
We're going in.

1293
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,629
We got company.

1294
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,278
Three, show me.

1295
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,190
Okay, as long as it's controlled.

1296
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,238
Give an exclusive to somebody you trust.

1297
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,595
I know just the person to call.

1298
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,591
That's my girl.

1299
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,159
All right, Lenny?

1300
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,073
I want you to push in.
Block as much of his view as you can.

1301
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,229
Lee?

1302
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,311
Do not make a move.

1303
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,758
If he turns around,

1304
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,558
we are all gonna die.

1305
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,429
Go.

1306
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,274
All right, Lenny.

1307
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,237
You're the last manned camera.

1308
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,835
Balls.

1309
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,395
Patty Fenn.

1310
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,352
Patty, Diane Lester.

1311
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,750
You better have something for me, Diane,
and I mean, right the fuck now.

1312
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,319
It's good to hear your voice, too.

1313
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,914
Um, I'm calling you to let you know
the information I gave you

1314
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,319
might have been incorrect.

1315
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,118
What the hell does that mean? "Incorrect"?

1316
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,155
Walt is going to make a
statement after all.

1317
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,310
We're in the car
en route to Federal Hall right now.

1318
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,879
We'll be about 20 minutes away.

1319
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,838
Twenty minutes? We need help right now!

1320
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,070
I'm trying to help you,
if you'll just listen.

1321
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,674
I'm going to send you a text
explaining what I need from you.

1322
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,875
So just keep a lid on it.

1323
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,236
Because I'm giving you this exclusively.
Don't screw it up.

1324
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,437
Reporters.

1325
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,755
Hello? Diane?

1326
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,513
Okay, everybody.
We're gonna begin evacuation one at a time.

1327
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,750
You first. Follow me to the crawlspace.

1328
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,479
We're ready and in position.
Give me the green light, we go.

1329
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,552
If we take out the receiver on Gates' chest,
what's his chance of survival?

1330
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,959
80% that he makes it.

1331
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,315
Okay.
What's the chance the bullet's on target?

1332
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,674
If it's a clean shot, 100%.

1333
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,995
100%.
Come on, let's be realistic here.

1334
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,674
I am being. Listen, 80% sounds about right
to us, to an officer.

1335
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,829
80%.

1336
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,357
So we got an 80% chance of an 80% chance.
Yeah, that's some shit math.

1337
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,955
Benson, let me know
when the control room is ready to evacuate.

1338
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,713
Now we're talking.

1339
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,028
Okay, guys,

1340
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,476
how do we find out what Walt Camby's jet
was doing in South Africa?

1341
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,074
- We could try the FAA.
- No, they won't help us.

1342
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,393
What about, um, the hacker guy
from the Citi security breach segment?

1343
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,313
- The guy with the Yoda voice.
- Yes! Yes! Find him. Quickly.

1344
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,870
Watch your head. Step here.

1345
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,997
Bree, where the hell is Ron Sprecher?
And has he gotten to the SEC yet?

1346
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,392
Um, I will check,
but I need to tell you something first.

1347
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,919
Okay, hold on. Just a second.

1348
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,718
Lee, Walt Camby has landed.

1349
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,119
He's on his way to Federal Hall.

1350
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,656
He'll be there in less than 20 minutes.

1351
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,832
And get this. He wasn't in Geneva yesterday.
He was in South Africa.

1352
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:32,911
So he lied to you. He lied to us.

1353
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,790
He's been lying this whole time.
That means you've been lying, too, Lee.

1354
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,032
To everybody that's been watching. To Kyle.

1355
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
Oh, my God.

1356
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,597
Where'd everybody go?

1357
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,309
Where'd they go?

1358
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,552
God damn it!

1359
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,278
I knew this would happen.

1360
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,480
- Let's go. Who's next?
- Charlie, in the sound booth.

1361
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,520
How stupid am I?

1362
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,119
Okay. Quick as you can.

1363
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,656
Get those hackers working.

1364
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,513
It's all your fault, Lee. You so stupid.

1365
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,518
This is Dave.

1366
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,216
I got your email, Dave.

1367
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,952
Help you, we will.

1368
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,555
This is Eagle One.
Target is in position.

1369
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,993
Bunch of crooks.

1370
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,639
Camby's never coming here.
We have to figure out a way, Kyle.

1371
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,870
Patty, I really need to,
uh, tell you something.

1372
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,360
Okay, hold on, just a second, Bree.

1373
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,476
No! Damn it! You need to hear this.

1374
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,190
Okay. What is it?

1375
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,272
Don't stop. Don't panic. Stay low.

1376
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,909
I'm so fucked!

1377
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,157
- Eagle, Do you have a clean shot?
- I'm yellow. Yellow.

1378
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,673
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1379
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,638
They're going to shoot Lee.
I heard every word. I was five-feet away.

1380
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,039
Let's go. This isn't voluntary.

1381
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,960
- Grab whatever you can grab.
- Jim. Take Jim.

1382
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,032
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

1383
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,990
I can't catch a fucking break.

1384
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,152
I'm never getting out of here. Fuck!

1385
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,240
Lee.

1386
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,416
- Just one time. One fucking time.
- They're making us leave.

1387
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,640
- Don't stop. It's gonna be fine.
- I'm good. Get Patty.

1388
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,434
Look at me.

1389
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,192
Don't look up. Look at me.

1390
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,273
There is a sniper on the catwalk
at your one o'clock.

1391
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,632
Where'd they fucking go?

1392
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,875
Huh?

1393
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,279
He's about to lose it, Benson.

1394
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,113
- Hold on. I got one lagging.
- Benson, hurry the hell up!

1395
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,589
There is a receiver on your vest.

1396
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,120
- Two seconds, I pull out my cuffs.
- Don't look down.

1397
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,312
If he shoots it out,
it disables the trigger.

1398
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,594
Get out of there, right now!

1399
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,680
Come on!

1400
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,836
- You got a shot?
- Are you green or red?

1401
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,751
- Green.
- Take the shot!

1402
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,416
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Fuck!

1403
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,112
The button!

1404
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,056
- Are you all right?
- What the fuck?

1405
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,469
They're shooting at me, not you!
God damn it!

1406
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,016
Just keep your finger on the button.

1407
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,359
Lee, can you hear me?

1408
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,200
What is this? You been talking to the cops
this whole time?

1409
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,679
That's Patty.

1410
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,873
Listen to me!

1411
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,997
She found Walt Camby.

1412
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,351
I'm gonna take you to him.
But you got to trust me.

1413
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,953
I got a plan.

1414
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,629
Listen, you got to block my vest.

1415
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
Go.

1416
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,714
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1417
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,336
- Hey, wait. What are we doing?
- We're getting out of here.

1418
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,713
Give me the mike.

1419
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,151
Are you setting me up?

1420
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,959
You want some answers?
We're gonna get some answers.

1421
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,439
Lenny, you coming?

1422
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,079
We're coming out!

1423
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,233
Lenny.

1424
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,469
You mind?

1425
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,400
Ah, balls.

1426
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,232
Holy shit.

1427
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,155
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't like elevators.

1428
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,873
Come on, Lenny.

1429
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,032
Lenny, where are you?

1430
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,636
What did I ever do to deserve
such a loyal goddamn crew, Lenny?

1431
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,040
- Not much.
- That's right.

1432
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,789
I need a satellite van and an audio package
downstairs in two minutes.

1433
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,038
Lenny, where are you?

1434
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,789
Jim, where's my feed with Lenny?
I need it right now.

1435
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,108
Come on, Lenny.

1436
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,000
Patty tells us to stay, we stay.

1437
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,519
Okay, Lenny's up! He's live.

1438
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,911
Yeah, Patty. It's always Patty.

1439
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,351
My first day on the job she told me
I had a penis where my brain should be.

1440
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,351
She's right. She's always right.

1441
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,896
She stayed here longer
than she should have.

1442
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
I know that.

1443
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,874
The truth is I don't know what I'd do
without her at this point.

1444
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,439
But if she was standing right here,
right now, I couldn't admit that.

1445
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,191
But luckily it's just you in front of me, Lenny.
You and your...

1446
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,998
Your warm eyes and your gentle soul.

1447
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,392
All right, get the fuck out of here.

1448
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,869
- I got a signal.
- Okay, are we live?

1449
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,032
Time to find Diane Lester. Let's go.

1450
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,429
- If you're still with us, here we go.
- Come on.

1451
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,360
- We're going that way, Lenny. That way.
- Okay.

1452
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,514
- Captain.
- No.

1453
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,320
We're on the move.
Clear a path.

1454
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,032
- That van comes with us!
- Clear the sat van.

1455
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,473
What are these people doing here?

1456
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,176
Now they've left the building.

1457
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,633
They are taking to the streets.

1458
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:40,238
Kyle Budwell and host Lee Gates
seem to be working together at this point.

1459
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
Hello?

1460
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,320
We're on our way to you now,
but we need something more.

1461
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,874
We've figured out where,
we need to find out why.

1462
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,280
He's been lying about everything.

1463
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,033
Keep him away from the news
until we figure out the connection.

1464
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,798
I understand.

1465
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,030
Here. You should put your suit on.

1466
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,080
I'll come back up for you
once they're all set up.

1467
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,479
Thanks.

1468
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,590
Jim, throw the feed into my sat van.

1469
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,872
You stay with Lenny on foot.
We're gonna go nat sound from his camera.

1470
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,951
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

1471
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,160
Patty! I just left the SEC.
I've been trying to call you.

1472
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,240
Yeah, Ron, listen.

1473
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,696
- Yeah, they got nothing over here.
- What?

1474
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,950
Ibis's algorithm trades in dark pools,

1475
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,276
so all their transactions are concealed.

1476
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,796
The one thing I was able to find out was,
on the day of the crash,

1477
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,598
Ibis's transaction volume

1478
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,636
dropped by nearly 90%.

1479
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,073
What does that mean?

1480
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,192
I don't know.

1481
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,555
How far away are you?

1482
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,517
I'm on... Where am I? I'm on Vesey Street.

1483
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,256
Bring me what you have, Ron.
I'll meet you at the corner of Pearl and Pine.

1484
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,416
Start running.
I'll see you in three minutes.

1485
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,796
What, three minutes? That's a half-mile away!
I can't run a half-mile in three...

1486
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
Hello?

1487
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,216
What are you folks doing?

1488
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,391
He's not O.J.!
Get off the street! That's a bomb!

1489
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,038
Bombs explode.

1490
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,776
You don't want to be near them
when they do.

1491
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,416
Frank Ross,
reporting from the eye in the sky.

1492
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,510
He is safely hovering above them.

1493
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,797
It's a rather distressing scene
down here, honestly.

1494
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,873
New Yorkers flocking to the melee
despite repeated police warnings

1495
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:16,317
to stay clear of the path of a man
with a bomb strapped to his chest.

1496
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,709
Apparently, a lot of people
sharing the feelings

1497
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,392
of gunman Kyle Budwell this moment.

1498
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,790
They are lining the streets,
they're cheering him on, as if to say,

1499
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,512
"Hey, Ibis, show us the money."

1500
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,398
...mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash

1501
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,919
My money ain't funny...

1502
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,878
They're a bunch of crooks!
Blow 'em all to hell!

1503
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,320
Get off me, man! Come on!

1504
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,832
Stay close.
Don't let them get a shot at the vest.

1505
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,992
Now might be a good time
to tell you something about that vest then.

1506
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,199
There's not actually any Semtex in there.
It's just clay. Blocks of clay.

1507
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,280
What?

1508
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,750
Yeah, I wanted to get your attention,
not blow up a goddamn building.

1509
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,511
Stand down. Easy.

1510
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,953
Well, they think it's real.

1511
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,952
So whatever you do, don't take your finger
off that goddamn trigger.

1512
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,600
We're in this together, you dumb shit.

1513
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,554
The drama featuring
host Lee Gates and Kyle Budwell.

1514
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,438
Wow, this is getting crazy!

1515
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,788
Look at all these people!

1516
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,552
My phone is blowing up on this.

1517
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,216
If Kyle makes it out of this thing,
we got to get him on the show.

1518
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,798
And the next time I have a bad day,

1519
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,269
I'm gonna come in, "Glitch!"

1520
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,315
Diane, why would Ibis's trading volume
suddenly drop 90%?

1521
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,549
90%?

1522
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,030
No, that's not possible.
Ibis's algorithms trade continuously.

1523
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,759
Somebody would have had to have
taken the computers offline.

1524
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,875
They would have...

1525
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,191
Human fingerprints.

1526
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,913
Walt.

1527
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,397
If Walt took that $800 million
away from the algorithm,

1528
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,993
what did he do with it?

1529
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,355
I have his phone. Shit.

1530
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,158
He's deleted all his emails.

1531
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,434
Try texts.

1532
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Goodloe.

1533
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,835
Mambo... Mambo...

1534
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,071
He and the COO keep mentioning
"Mambo" over and over again.

1535
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,195
"Mambo"?

1536
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,554
Mambo, like the dance?

1537
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,496
- "Mambo"?
- Keep it clear. Back it up, back it up!

1538
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,078
Hey! Hey!

1539
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,998
Get out of the way! Hey!

1540
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,354
Get out of the way!

1541
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,315
Patty!

1542
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,280
- We're on it, Diane.
- Stop. Stop. Stop. Patty.

1543
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,231
Get this earpiece to Lee.
He needs to hear me.

1544
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,016
Great. But how exactly
am I supposed to get this to him?

1545
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,873
I don't know, Ron. You're a producer.
Produce your way up there!

1546
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,560
I'm not getting anything on the terminal.
I'm gonna do a web search.

1547
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,878
Okay, I'm getting...

1548
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,749
"Mambo Pizza Place..."

1549
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,036
"Mambo Italiano..."
I'm not finding anything.

1550
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,314
"Mambo Snakes."

1551
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,913
"Mamba" snakes. That's not it.

1552
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,696
Try "Mambo South Africa."
Try anything South African.

1553
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,720
Got it. One sec.

1554
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,235
Holy shit.

1555
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,870
It's not a program. It's a goddamn person.

1556
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,914
Remember Zuccotti Park!

1557
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,914
Occupy Wall Street!

1558
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,150
Hey, Lee! Lee!

1559
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:18,840
Hey!

1560
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,235
Lee!

1561
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,115
Lee!

1562
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,149
Do it, man!
Come on. Blow this mother up!

1563
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,555
Lee! Lee, hey! Lee! Your earpiece!

1564
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,993
- Shit.
- Ron!

1565
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,959
Do not shoot!

1566
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,679
Do not shoot!

1567
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,554
Lee, can you hear me?

1568
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,000
Camera mike's down.
He's not gonna be able to respond.

1569
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,397
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stay where you are!

1570
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,229
Lee?

1571
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,231
Lee, are you there?
If you can hear me, put your hand in the air.

1572
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,793
Okay. I can see you, but
I can't get to you.

1573
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,711
What am I gonna do?

1574
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,672
We either keep going or we stop.
It's up to you.

1575
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,677
ESU, forward.

1576
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,553
First window we get,
we're taking the assailant down.

1577
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,880
Move them back.

1578
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,360
- Stay down.
- Stay behind the car.

1579
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,633
Diane, are you still there?

1580
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,720
Yeah, I'm here.

1581
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,631
Okay. We are on Mambo.

1582
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,631
Our van can't get any closer.

1583
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,039
So keep Walt there.

1584
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,958
Do not let him run before
Lee can get to you.

1585
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,519
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

1586
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,874
All right. Get on it, Dave.

1587
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,816
Print out everything you can
on this miners' strike.

1588
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,671
- I'm gonna need that, too.
- Okay.

1589
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,875
Lee?

1590
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,352
You can hear me now.

1591
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,157
Which is good.

1592
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,112
I have a lot to explain,

1593
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,431
and I need you to listen
very carefully for once.

1594
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,479
We're approaching Federal Hall.

1595
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,555
Jesus. Is that live?

1596
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,799
Mmm-hmm. It is now.

1597
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,873
Did you get all that?
And that's before we start digging.

1598
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,997
- Ibis is a pig in a prom dress, Lee.
- Got it.

1599
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,736
We are trying to find the proof right now.

1600
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,616
See if you can get those hacker guys.
Find out what they've come up with.

1601
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,949
Now, Lee,
we're making a pretty big leap here.

1602
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,550
So if Walt's gonna hang himself,
you're gonna have to hand him that rope.

1603
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,195
I'll just point the camera in your direction,
and we'll figure it out together.

1604
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,596
Hey. Get ready for a show.

1605
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,816
Well, these guys are certainly behaving

1606
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,230
like they've got an appointment
with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO.

1607
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,629
Which begs the question
on everyone's mind,

1608
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,472
where is Walt Camby?

1609
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,638
As a curious crowd
assembles outside Federal Hall,

1610
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,119
the missing piece of the puzzle...

1611
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,394
I trusted you.

1612
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,471
Yeah, well, I trusted you, too.

1613
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,996
So I guess that means we're both wrong.

1614
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,313
What did you do, Diane?
I mean, you know me.

1615
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,390
You know me better than my wife.

1616
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,040
- You know me better than anybody.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1617
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,115
I have no idea what you think I did.

1618
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,713
Save it for the cameras, Walt.

1619
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,473
An eyewitness in the crowd
may just have the answer.

1620
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,680
Walt Camby?

1621
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,036
He's inside. He just went up those stairs
and through those doors.

1622
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,176
- You saw him?
- That's right.

1623
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,156
Guess there's nowhere to run now, huh?

1624
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,198
This story does seem to be coming
to some sort of head down here.

1625
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,639
- Hey there, big shot.
- Hey.

1626
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,336
- Ready for that interview now?
- Hey.

1627
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,360
Hey.

1628
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,476
You're just in time for the show.

1629
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,839
How was Geneva?

1630
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,514
- It was fine.
- Yeah, I hear it's lovely this time of year.

1631
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,909
Can we get him a chair?

1632
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,000
Sam, give him a chair.

1633
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,229
Whoa.

1634
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,352
The Iceland guys just came through
with all the facial recognition data.

1635
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,317
This footage goes back months.

1636
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,016
Everywhere he's traveled.
There's way too much stuff.

1637
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,157
Okay, well, just focus on the last 48 hours.
And cue up the video package.

1638
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,736
Can we get everybody outta here?

1639
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,432
Young lady, please, exit the building.

1640
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,976
Wait a second,
why does she get to leave?

1641
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,736
This might be able to help
with your investigation.

1642
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,398
This is all her fault.

1643
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,833
Go ahead, Diane, walk away.

1644
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,576
You're the only reason we're
stuck here with this psycho.

1645
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,114
You wanted transparency, Walt?
Well, here's your chance.

1646
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Let's go.

1647
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,396
Everybody hates you.

1648
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,280
Okay, now look, everything is fine.

1649
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,216
So why don't we just put the weapons down,
and let's just talk about it.

1650
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,312
No, I... I think we can talk
with the weapons up. Right, guys?

1651
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,509
- This is Money Monster, coming to you live.
- Back off.

1652
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,955
We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.

1653
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,554
So, Walt,
now that we have you here in person,

1654
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,234
we can finally ask the
$800 million question.

1655
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,753
What happened at Ibis, Walt?

1656
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,469
As we've been saying since day one,
this was an isolated computer glitch.

1657
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,556
Goddamn it!

1658
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,400
- Glitch!
- He doesn't really like that word.

1659
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,118
I fuckin' hate that word!

1660
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,434
Oh, not the glitch.

1661
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,296
- Cue up video one.
- I fucking hate that word.

1662
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,356
And then line the rest
of 'em up on my mark.

1663
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,150
You tried to convince us it's all too
complicated for us to understand.

1664
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,836
But it's not that
complicated at all, is it?

1665
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,040
It's actually the oldest story
in the book. Fraud.

1666
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,910
You took money out of your fund
and you invested it here.

1667
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,149
Go.

1668
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,310
Right here in platinum mines in South Africa.
Does that sound familiar?

1669
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,634
I don't have our portfolio in front of me.
I can't exactly...

1670
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,315
You really need your portfolio
to know where you put $800 million?

1671
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,351
I don't put that much money anywhere.

1672
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,776
The algorithms control our day-to-day...

1673
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,917
But that's not how high-frequency trading
is supposed to work, is it?

1674
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,070
They don't just put that much money
in one place

1675
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,031
and just leave it there, do they?

1676
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,754
It wasn't the algos pullin' the strings,
it was you.

1677
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,958
The miners' union strike here
outside Johannesburg is on its second week.

1678
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,237
You. You bought and paid
for a two-week strike.

1679
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,912
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

1680
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,349
Go.

1681
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,597
The strike had caused
the mining company's stock to drop.

1682
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,712
You buy low, you get the strike to stop,
you sell high.

1683
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,029
That's the plan.

1684
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,278
You make one big bribe to the right guy,
line your own pockets,

1685
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,509
and no one'll be the wiser.

1686
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,996
You're making accusations
that have no basis in reality.

1687
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,115
Video three on my mark.

1688
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,896
- All right, all right, all right. One...
- Get it together.

1689
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,576
- Okay, it's there. Got it.
- It's defamation, okay?

1690
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,656
And there are laws about that.

1691
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,536
Go on, Walt.
Tell me about all the laws I'm breaking.

1692
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,216
Ready when you are, Lee.
On your mark.

1693
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,309
Look, I'll give you this.

1694
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,870
There really was a glitch in your system.
It just wasn't the computer.

1695
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,632
It was this guy. Moshe Mambo.

1696
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,869
We must say no!

1697
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,509
We must say no to their businesses!
We must say no to their bribes!

1698
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,512
You tried to bribe the one guy
that couldn't be bought.

1699
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,239
All they care about is money!

1700
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,072
If it takes two years,
if it takes 20 years,

1701
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,077
we will stay here and strike
until our voices are heard.

1702
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,309
Pause.

1703
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,276
There. Right there. That's your glitch.

1704
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,512
Because that's what sent
the mining company's stock plummeting,

1705
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,068
which sent
your secret $800 million investment

1706
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,559
right into the toilet.

1707
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,511
Want me to keep goin'?

1708
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,416
- Patty. You gotta see this.
- You made people a lot of money, Walt.

1709
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,696
You just needed to wreck industries and destroy
economies all over the world to do it.

1710
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,951
Okay. Get that ready right now. Lee?

1711
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,000
You're gonna say everything I say.

1712
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,040
This is insane.

1713
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,512
I don't know the first thing
about some South African workers' strike.

1714
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,875
I've never even heard of this Mambo.

1715
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,151
- Really? Never?
- Really? Never?

1716
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,016
Well, what were you two arguing about
this morning?

1717
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,793
Then what were you two arguing about
this morning

1718
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,832
at 8: 02 a.m., local time?

1719
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,195
Or maybe they're speaking Swahili
in Geneva these days.

1720
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,238
They don't speak Swahili
in South Africa, either.

1721
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,256
And this wasn't the first time
you did it, either.

1722
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,874
This was just the first
time it didn't work out.

1723
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,958
You feel that, Walt?

1724
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,195
That sticky heat
risin' up the back of your neck?

1725
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,152
That flop sweat?

1726
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,833
That's fear.

1727
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,470
Greed you're already acquainted with.

1728
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,319
That's all a great story, Lee.
I'm actually sorry the real one's so boring.

1729
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,841
But the truth is,
our computational systems are far too...

1730
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,360
You know, forget it. Just shoot him.

1731
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,392
Actually, I got a better idea.

1732
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,272
Up. Up, up, up.

1733
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,389
Take the vest off. Put it on him.

1734
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,715
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

1735
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,176
Hold on.
That's just gonna make things worse.

1736
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,031
I already told you, back off.

1737
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,515
Fuckin' cops.

1738
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,432
- Lenny.
- All right.

1739
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,477
- Now? Okay.
- Just right here.

1740
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,234
Listen, I'm gonna do you a solid.
And trust me on this.

1741
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,197
Don't turn your back on anybody.

1742
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,035
You're a thief, Walt.

1743
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,952
And a crook.

1744
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,598
And I want to hear you admit it.

1745
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,829
I didn't steal a dime,

1746
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,456
- and we didn't do anything illegal.
- Bullshit!

1747
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,616
- You manipulated stock prices.
- You don't care what I'm gonna say.

1748
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,856
- You bribed people.
- You need someone to blame.

1749
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,776
- You broke the law.
- You've already decided it's gonna be me.

1750
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,031
What law?
Name one law you can prove I broke.

1751
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,296
No, don't look at him.
He can't prove it, either.

1752
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,959
This is just business.
And this is how business is done.

1753
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,680
- That doesn't make it right.
- Oh, please.

1754
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,398
Tell that to the Chinese.

1755
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,856
Tell that to the Russians.
'Cause if it's not us, it's gonna be them.

1756
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:40,995
Hell, it already is.

1757
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,516
You see, that's the irony about all this.

1758
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,440
You only came after me
'cause I lost you money.

1759
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,394
Nobody was asking questions
when everybody was makin' a profit.

1760
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,392
You just gobbled up every dollar of stock
you could afford.

1761
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,718
As long as we kept paying you 18% ROI
every year,

1762
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,376
then you could keep bragging to your
friends about what a genius you are.

1763
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,277
But, hey, you're not a genius,

1764
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,475
you're a stockholder.

1765
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,754
I told you what I want.

1766
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,896
Yeah, I get it. You want a profit.
That's what everybody wants.

1767
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,856
- No, that's not what I want.
- Listen, just give us some time.

1768
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,936
We're gonna make every single dime...

1769
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,235
I want to hear you admit it,
you son of a bitch!

1770
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,320
I think he just did.

1771
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,392
No, I want to hear him say that he lied,
that what he did was wrong.

1772
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,994
Wrong? What does that even mean, wrong?

1773
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,880
You got three seconds till I blow your ass
outta this goddamn building.

1774
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,056
- Three.
- What's wrong with makin' a profit?

1775
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,911
- What's wrong with being faster...
- Two!

1776
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,536
What's wrong with betting big?
Winning isn't wrong...

1777
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,913
- One!
- Fine!

1778
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,554
It was wrong.

1779
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,278
- It was wrong.
- Oh, my...

1780
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,994
It was wrong.

1781
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,553
It was wrong.

1782
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,237
That's all I wanted to hear, man.

1783
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,913
- Did you hear that?
- Nice.

1784
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,595
Kyle, don't.

1785
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,959
Kyle, don't.

1786
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,272
- Kyle, don't!
- No! Fuck! Don't!

1787
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,230
- God! Kyle, no!
- Stand down!

1788
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,776
- Goddamn it!
- I said stand down!

1789
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,056
- Get his gun!
- I said stand down!

1790
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:16,195
- Hey!
- Call an ambulance!

1791
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,976
- Shots fired. Repeat, we've got shots fired.
- Oh, my God.

1792
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,389
What are you doin' to him?
Get him an ambulance!

1793
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,951
Get him an ambulance!
Get him an ambulance!

1794
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,496
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get off! What are you...

1795
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,238
- Room is secure!
- He can't breathe!

1796
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:28,151
- Hey!
- What are you doin' to him?

1797
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,672
Get him an ambulance!

1798
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,438
Hey, Kyle, you hang in there, buddy!

1799
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,991
Kyle!

1800
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,554
You hang in there, buddy.

1801
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,256
- You're good to go, pal.
- Yeah.

1802
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,280
You're all set.

1803
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,675
That kid's a nutcase.

1804
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,674
You son of a bitch.

1805
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,108
Hey, all right.

1806
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,470
- Just sit down.
- You see that? He just assaulted me.

1807
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,913
Call a cop.

1808
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You got a pulse?

1809
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,056
You got anything?

1810
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,080
No, sir.

1811
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,511
Oh, my God.

1812
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:33,032
They shot him. Did you see that?

1813
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,880
Clear for the coroner.

1814
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,073
Copy that.

1815
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,478
This is Powell. He's been taken out.

1816
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,672
Called at 3:58 p.m.

1817
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,637
Clear it. Studio has control.

1818
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,550
Excuse me, sir.
A quick question.

1819
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,790
You had the chance to leave.
Why did you stay?

1820
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,555
I was just... I was just doin' my job.

1821
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,279
You know, I don't quit
until the director tells me to.

1822
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,869
Your name is?

1823
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:55,239
My name is Lenny Libatino. It's...
It's L-E-N-N-Y, not... Not the I-E.

1824
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,160
When did you know
you were in danger?

1825
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,477
I think right from the gunshot, you know,

1826
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,791
but, uh, like I said, I was more interested
in keeping him in the frame.

1827
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,976
Maybe I should have got
hair and makeup for Lenny, huh?

1828
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,673
Host Lee Gates is
recuperating in a downtown hospital,

1829
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,073
along with wounded producer Ron Sprecher.
He is expected to make a full recovery.

1830
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,514
How's Ron?

1831
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,118
He's out of surgery, he's in recovery.
He's gonna be fine.

1832
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,548
Good.

1833
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,992
- What do you got there?
- Dinner.

1834
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,835
I heard you had an opening
in your schedule.

1835
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,556
So this is a Friday night for you, huh?

1836
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:33,835
Yep.

1837
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,357
...thanks to this
single individual. Back to you, Sherry.

1838
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,317
The gunman's name
is Kyle Budwell,

1839
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,551
24 years old, a parcel truck driver
from Queens, New York.

1840
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:46,997
Further details about him are still unknown
at this hour, as are concrete motives.

1841
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,753
But it's been reported
that personal financial troubles,

1842
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,836
coupled with his mother's death
six months ago,

1843
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,831
could have been contributing factors.

1844
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,912
And regulators are saying,
"Not so fast, Walt Camby."

1845
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,799
The SEC just announced
that Ibis Clear Capital

1846
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,429
is facing a Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act investigation.

1847
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:08,076
Violations of that act can carry
heavy criminal and civil penalties.

1848
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,678
Meanwhile, Vines of Ibis's CEO Walt Camby

1849
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,274
have quickly become
an online phenomenon,

1850
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:18,239
variations of which have already racked up
over 10 million views online.

1851
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,113
No! No! Fuck!

1852
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,152
No! No! Fuck!

1853
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,000
No! No! Fuck!

1854
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,216
Sherry Benedict, thank you for that report.

1855
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,920
We'll come back to you later in the day
as more information emerges.

1856
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,096
So what the hell kind of show
are we gonna do next week?

1857
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:34,376
Things aren't
all bad for the Money Monster host,

1858
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,312
as viewership of Money Monster,
which had recently slid in the ratings,

1859
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,517
skyrocketed after word
of the hostage crisis spread.

1860
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,391
Lee Gates may owe that gunman
a debt of thanks.

1861
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,896
Well, it may have been
an eventful afternoon

1862
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,990
outside the actual Stock Exchange,

1863
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,312
but it was a rather pedestrian day inside.
The Dow was down nine points, less than...

1864
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,631
NASDAQ dropped 13 points,
thanks to a shaky morning in the tech sector.

1865
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:00,030
Wall Street is a casino.
They're gambling with your money.

1866
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,870
Your company was called "a great vampire
squid wrapped around the face of humanity."

1867
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,077
He found his fame on
YouTube, of all places.

1868
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,715
I'm hip, blue chip makes glasses connect

1869
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,189
Filled with champagne,
toast to the bread we get

1870
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,396
The bigger the building,
the bigger the foundation

1871
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,869
Peep how Wall Street is pimping our nation

1872
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,951
I feel bossy, watch my dough rise

1873
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,554
Kick folks in the street,
glad I ain't those guys

1874
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,576
The bigger the building,
the bigger the foundation

1875
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,875
Peep how Wall Street is pimping our nation

1876
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,235
When one wins, someone loses,
that's the chances

1877
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,550
It's competition, relieve finances

1878
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,756
So far but we reached our consensus

1879
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,035
If not, we 'll meddle with consequences

1880
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,429
Traffic and bills, freeway of exchange

1881
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,636
One-way ticket, y'all lose, we gain

1882
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,950
USA, wave the flag like gang colors

1883
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,190
Bang on, but you'll be glad I came, brother

1884
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,356
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1885
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,635
I welcome the money and the cash

1886
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,955
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1887
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,996
I welcome the money and the cash

1888
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,311
At the welcome mat swollen fat

1889
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,630
In stupid stacks, the cash

1890
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,029
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1891
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,315
I welcome the money and the cash

1892
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,749
Wall Street is rigged like a 14-wheeler

1893
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,990
No one gets the plot,
and we're not revealing

1894
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,594
We got to live like emperors,
we ain't going down

1895
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,910
We stay in the 1%, you under it

1896
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,638
It's like they sent the hellhounds

1897
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,109
On an ice cream cone
how the global meltdown

1898
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,236
Financially, they ain't catching me

1899
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,555
They can't capture a phantom
they haven't seen

1900
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,915
Fuss with your folks all day for crumbs

1901
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,911
You work, we play, hooray for us

1902
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,468
We're the master puppeteers
with the leverage

1903
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,994
Sneak up behind and get a wedgie in

1904
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,116
With technology people are obsolete

1905
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,475
Fossil fuels is all you are to me

1906
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,630
Hugs go out to the world, I love you, fam

1907
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,075
Backslide your cash,
I call that sleight of hand

1908
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,230
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1909
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,470
I welcome the money and the cash

1910
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,710
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1911
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,950
I welcome the money and the cash

1912
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,395
At the welcome mat swollen fat

1913
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,391
In stupid stacks, the cash

1914
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,710
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1915
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,791
I welcome the money and the cash

1916
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,519
Call us super rich, we're hero to y'all

1917
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,830
We hedge bets, scalp
You give your half off

1918
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,155
Trust us, of course we'll give y'all a job

1919
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,879
One day you too can live high on the hog

1920
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,155
Wrong, you get
left in the hole starving

1921
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,310
Hit the margin, so what?
That's your problem

1922
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,675
Hoard that bread just like the nasty hooker

1923
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,955
Heels crack the concrete,
she walkin' crooked

1924
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,315
Lookit, all the assholes you see as stars

1925
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,675
All gonna be broke, yep, the world is ours

1926
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,876
Put a twist on it too, like a Hefty bag

1927
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,155
In the end, it's fittin',
what's left is trash

1928
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,356
Whistleblowers hiss like cobras

1929
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,635
If we sense resistance, it's over

1930
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,830
Bull market, bear market

1931
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,831
Wild kingdom, yes, you the target

1932
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,070
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1933
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,430
I welcome the money and the cash

1934
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,511
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1935
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,034
I welcome the money and the cash

1936
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,156
At the welcome mat, swollen fat

1937
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,356
In stupid stacks, the cash

1938
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,590
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1939
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,274
I welcome the money and the cash
