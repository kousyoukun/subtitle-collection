1
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,543
Mrs Larson?

2
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,011
lt...

3
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:01,098
lt won't be much longer, Mrs Larson.

4
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,936
Well, is he in a lot of pain?

5
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,815
No. No, no. There will be
no more pain for your husband.

6
00:01:10,857 --> 00:01:13,234
He's heavily sedated.

7
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,738
OK. l think l'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

8
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,866
No. No, no. l don't think
that's such a good idea.

9
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:24,077
With all the painkillers,

10
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,746
the reverend's not exactly himself.

11
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,291
Look, l think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

12
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,753
l mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,050
Well, your call.

14
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,303
Nurse?

15
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,557
Yes, Reverend Larson?

16
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,185
- Did you see the cowboy?
- The cowboy?

17
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:55,064
The cowboy who gave me
the singing nickel in Pudding Town?

18
00:01:56,065 --> 00:02:00,194
OK. l think it's time
to turn down the morphine drip.

19
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:07,700
Reverend Larson, your son is here.

20
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:11,871
OK, sure. Send her in.

21
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:14,749
Ladies? A little privacy.

22
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,100
Dad?

23
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,770
lt's me, Dad. Hal.

24
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:46,653
Glad you're here, kiddo.
Got a few things to tell ya.

25
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:54,118
First, l want you to promise
that no matter what you do in life,

26
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:57,121
you will never ever settle for average.

27
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,040
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:04,586
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

29
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:10,133
Don't do what l did.

30
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:15,262
l married for love, and your mother
Betty has been a nightmare.

31
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:18,682
But, Dad, Mom's name is Marian.

32
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,853
Listen to me. l'm giving you pearls here.

33
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:28,107
And third, find yourself

34
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,986
a classic beauty

35
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:38,659
with a perfect can, and great totties.

36
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:43,914
That will put you in good stead
with the Lord. lt's all in here.

37
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,376
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,673
Hot young tail's what it's all about.

39
00:03:55,382 --> 00:04:00,178
Hot young tail.

40
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,239
l'll make you proud, Papa.

41
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:20,140
Jackass, can you not hear me down there?

42
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:23,768
l don't want anything to do with you,
you little warthog.

43
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,271
You had me at ''Get lost.''

44
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:31,109
- What's up, Mauricio?
- Hey, Hal.

45
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:34,612
- How's the crowd tonight?
- Good. l got a few bites.

46
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,656
- Can l get you a drink?
- l won't say no to that.

47
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,910
Two beers.

48
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,496
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

49
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:48,082
So, l didn't expect to see you here.
Where's your new girl Loni?

50
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,084
- Lindy.
- Lindy.

51
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:53,004
- She's...
- There you go.

52
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:56,340
Actually, l didn't tell her
l was goin' out tonight.

53
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,425
Why not? Things OK with you guys?

54
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,095
Yeah, a little too OK,
ifyou know what l'm talkin' about.

55
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:06,474
- What does that mean?
- Things are going in the shitter real quick.

56
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,727
Jeez, l'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

57
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:12,813
- She's not. l'm dumping her.
- You're dumping Loni?

58
00:07:12,897 --> 00:07:16,358
- Lindy.
- What, are you crazy? Lindy's gorgeous.

59
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:20,696
On the surface, but when you get to know her
better, there's a whole other story goin' on.

60
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:22,948
Yeah? How goes that?

61
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:28,203
We're sitting there, you know, and
she's got her bare feet up on the couch,

62
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:33,124
and l notice that her second toe is, like,
half an inch longer than her big toe.

63
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:38,462
- That's it? You're breaking up over that?
- Hey, l don't need that circus shit.

64
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:41,923
Well, couldn't she get the toe
filed down or something?

65
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,593
What, then l'm dating a nub?

66
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,137
l'm starting to think we're jinxed here.

67
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:50,598
- Speak for yourself, my friend.
- What, you got the promotion?

68
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:55,978
l don't hear till tomorrow, but guess who
is now officially going out with Jill.

69
00:07:56,103 --> 00:08:00,107
Jill? Your neighbour Jill?
You're going out with Jill, your neighbour?

70
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,526
And she doesn't exactly hate me.

71
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:05,278
Get out!

72
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,824
You are the luckiest man on the planet.
So what are you doing here?

73
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,702
She's hostessing until 11. l better get going.

74
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:16,455
l'm gonna try to catch her on the way home,
see if she wants to get a drink.

75
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,541
lf l know you, that's not all she'll be gettin'.

76
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,627
See you later.

77
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,423
- l said no.
- No? Why not?

78
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,886
l don't wanna have a drink with you. l wanna
go home. ls that so hard to understand?

79
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:37,099
- What's goin' on? Are you mad?
- No, l'm not mad. l just...

80
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:41,353
Go on, say it. You know what?
No matter what it is, we're gonna work it out.

81
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:45,607
Hal, l'm not attracted to you.

82
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:51,612
So what? You think everyone who goes out
is attracted to each other? Get real.

83
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:54,407
They're attracted to each other
in the beginning.

84
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:58,118
Oh, come on. That sounds
like a bunch of New Age hooey.

85
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:02,706
Maybe for some people
there's a little spark in the beginning,

86
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,793
but for most, the attraction part
happens way later. Whoa!

87
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,380
What? That's it?
Just like that, we're breaking up?

88
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,800
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

89
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,846
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all l need.

90
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:22,974
- Why do you need five days?
- Tomorrow l'm finally getting my promotion.

91
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:26,686
There's gonna be parties, dinners,
this, that. l need you now.

92
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:29,897
Hal, you're gonna be so busy,
you won't even think about me.

93
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:33,442
How am l not gonna think about you?
You live right across the hall.

94
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:38,238
l don't know, Hal.
Maybe you should think about moving.

95
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,754
Hal, we've made a decision
regarding that wholesaler position.

96
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,632
Yes! lt's about time, Dave.

97
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,552
We decided to go with the gal from Merrill.

98
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,889
She's a proven entity. A big producer.

99
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,059
- l'm sorry, man.
- No, it's...

100
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,522
The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

101
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,860
- Hal, l'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

102
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:23,572
- You should have gotten it. You deserved it.
- No, l didn't.

103
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:27,283
l didn't put them in a position
where they had to promote me or lose me.

104
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:31,454
lt's a good lesson.
Make yourself indispensable, that's the key.

105
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:34,915
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

106
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,377
Dumped you? Don't you have to be
going out to get dumped?

107
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,255
- What does that mean?
- Well, l just thought it was more of a...

108
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,551
Anyway, why do you care so much?
Jill wasn't right for you and you know it.

109
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:49,095
How can you say that? She was perfect.

110
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,473
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

111
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,142
And by the way, her tits weren't even real.

112
00:10:55,226 --> 00:10:58,896
Well, l could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

113
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,440
Hal, l don't understand how a guy

114
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:07,237
who's as nice and loyal and generous as you
could have such a huge flaw.

115
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,280
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:14,076
lt never occurred to you that picking girls
on their looks may not be the best way?

117
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,204
Am l supposed to apologise
for having high standards?

118
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:20,916
High standards? ln the five years
l've known you, every woman -

119
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:25,086
l should say girl - you've gone after
has been completely out ofyour league.

120
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,506
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.

121
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,051
She's just saying
you're not that good-looking.

122
00:11:32,176 --> 00:11:35,179
Oh! l thought she was implying
something really mean.

123
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,972
No.

124
00:11:57,241 --> 00:12:00,494
Hey, it's you. You're the TV guru guy.

125
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:04,331
- Yes, Tony Robbins. Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah! Oh, man!

126
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:07,542
So, wow! You gave advice
to whatchamacallit.

127
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,877
- President Clinton? Mandela?
- No, no, no.

128
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,505
- Gorbachev?
- No, no. Pamela Anderson.

129
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,342
Right? Yeah! Give me another handshake.

130
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:20,887
Wow! Man, look at those mitts!
lt's like grabbing a bunch of bananas.

131
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:22,806
And those dogs. How big are those?

132
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,308
- Size 16, buddy.
- Holy cannoli.

133
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,811
- So you must do pretty good with the ladies.
- Just one.

134
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:30,813
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:35,568
She sounds hot!

136
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,153
- She is an amazing lady.
- l bet.

137
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,990
- So, what are you doin' in my town?
- We're doing a seminar here.

138
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:46,244
l help people to deal with the challenges
in life with more dignity and courage.

139
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,122
That's my deal, is the courage. l try to...

140
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:53,876
Hang on a second. Buddy, hang on.
The elevatorjust stopped. That's weird.

141
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,961
- Man, yeah. So what do we...?
- Hang on.

142
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,547
- Are you OK? l'm fine.
- You OK?

143
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,717
Yeah, yeah. lt's just l feel a little light-headed.

144
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:11,517
Then she dumped me. Flat out. Without
even the courtesy of a severance pop.

145
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:14,603
- A severance pop?
- You know, one last...

146
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,983
To ease the pain. The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

147
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,694
lt sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

148
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:25,947
Yeah. See, the problem is l'm kinda picky.

149
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:31,702
- What do you mean, ''picky''?
- Well, for instance, l like 'em real young.

150
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:35,789
Like, did you ever see Paulina
in her first Sports IIIustrated layout?

151
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:39,877
- You're looking for a young Paulina type?
- That face, but with better headlights.

152
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,171
You know how hers
have kind of dimmed lately?

153
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,799
Heidi Klum's beams would do. And her teeth.

154
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:49,093
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great knockers.

155
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:51,721
But she's a tad muscular.

156
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:55,808
Actually, you know what? Her ass would do,
too, if she had a better grille.

157
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,727
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

158
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:01,980
But she'd have to be
a little smilier than Michelle.

159
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:05,400
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

160
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,404
But not as skinny. Someone meatier,
like Heidi, but without the accent.

161
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:12,365
You know those accents: yah-yah-yah-yah.

162
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,869
They really get old fast. You know
what l'm saying. Someone like that.

163
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:21,206
Don't you think you're being a little bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

164
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:26,211
Well, no. l mean, you know,
l'd like her to be into culture and shit, too.

165
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,422
OK, hypothetical situation.

166
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:34,009
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

167
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:37,012
Ooh, toughie. That's a toughie.

168
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:40,140
How's the remaining breast? ls it big?

169
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:45,103
- How's your relationship with your parents?
- Excellent. l mean, my mom's hilarious.

170
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,272
She golfs every afternoon.

171
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:51,359
Actually, l don't really remember my dad.
He died when l was nine, so...

172
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:53,986
lfyou were nine, you should remember a lot.

173
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,863
Yeah, but l don't.

174
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:59,825
My mom thinks l might have been
a little traumatised by the whole thing.

175
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:03,370
Anyway, all l remember is, he was great.

176
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:06,748
He was a great guy,
and l really loved him, but...

177
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:11,377
l'm sorry you lost him.
Hey, listen, l know you got a great heart.

178
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,463
You're just fixated on
the outside appearances of people.

179
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,383
- Hal Larson, l'm gonna do you a great favour.
- Really?

180
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,970
This is how it'll work. From this moment on,
whenever you meet someone in the future,

181
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,264
you're only gonna see what's inside them.

182
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,519
So you'll respond to that, because that,
my friend, is where the true beauty lies.

183
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:32,313
OK, Tony, l think
you're getting a little cabin fever.

184
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,024
Hold on. What if l told you by doing this,

185
00:15:35,107 --> 00:15:39,027
you could have the most beautiful women
in the world and they'd want you?

186
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:43,114
- ls this like what you do in your seminars?
- No, no, this is very special.

187
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,243
This is just between you and me.
Let's get up and l'll show you what to do.

188
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:51,080
Now, you got a pattern of looking at women
and judging them by the exterior.

189
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:54,917
We gotta break that pattern.
So has there been a time

190
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,962
when you were especially shallow with a
woman, where you thought you were better?

191
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,631
- All the time.
- All the time.

192
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,508
ls there one specific time
where you were really shallow?

193
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,010
- Oh, yeah, l got one.
- Think about that.

194
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:08,179
Devils, come out!

195
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:11,682
- What the hell are you doin', banana hands?
- Just hang on.

196
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,727
- We gottajolt your nervous system.
- Oh, yeah. l'm sorry.

197
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,106
lt's notjust talking about it. Here's what
l want you to do. Just relax for a moment.

198
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:23,026
- l won't do that again.
- l didn't mean the ''banana hands'' thing.

199
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:28,031
Close your eyes. Just relax. And l want you
to imagine that you're on a beach.

200
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,742
lt's a warm day and the sun
is just starting to set.

201
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:36,580
And you're looking in the eyes of a woman,
and you're feeling her heart.

202
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:39,041
You're seeing her soul.

203
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,669
You're feeling her spirit.

204
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,380
That's it. That's it.

205
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,882
Excellent. Excellent.

206
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,100
Taxi!

207
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,314
l'm sorry. l thought that...

208
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:09,402
No, it's my fault. l didn't see you.
This is your cab. l'm gonna get the next cab.

209
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:14,073
- OK.
- All right.

210
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:19,828
Look, l'm just headed over to the East Side.

211
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,665
- Do you wanna share, or...?
- Yeah!

212
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:28,253
Yeah, let's take this one.
So, awesome. Thank you. Terrific.

213
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,757
- Where to?
- East Side Plaza for me, please.

214
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,217
Likewise.

215
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,483
- What?
- Oh. Huh? Sorry. l just...

216
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:56,904
l mean, yeah, you're really pretty.

217
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:04,035
Yeah, right. Jeez,
is everybody in this city so flattering?

218
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,664
l figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

219
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,749
- Boston.
- Bean Town.

220
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,668
The musical fruit.

221
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,255
The more you eat, the more you toot.

222
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,259
So, are you here on a shoot or something?

223
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,305
- A shoot?
- l mean, you must be a model, right?

224
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:38,358
My grandmother's not doing so well, so l
took a year offfrom school to help her out.

225
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,236
Oh. Helping granny. Cool.

226
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:52,330
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

227
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,291
Bye.

228
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,919
So, nice catchin' up.

229
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:10,638
Listen, um... l know you'll probably think
l'm some kind ofwacko for asking, but...

230
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:12,932
What?

231
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:16,435
Well, while you're here in town,
l mean, you know...

232
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:21,898
ifyou ever feel like taking a break from
hangin' out with your old sick granny,

233
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:24,526
you know, we could...

234
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:27,153
- Sure. l mean...
- Really?

235
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:29,989
Are you kidding? Yeah! That'd be...

236
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,283
l would absolutely love to, if...

237
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,077
OK, yeah. l should get your number, then.

238
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:38,163
No, no. l'll get yours, because it would...

239
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:41,541
- With my luck, you'll lose mine, so...
- Oh. l get it.

240
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,544
Very funny. You got me.
That was... No, that was good.

241
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:48,506
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile. That was harsh.

242
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:51,008
l don't need this shit.

243
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,010
What?

244
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:56,222
- l do want your number.
- Oh, l'm sorry!

245
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,267
l don't know what... That was dumb.
l was saying something...

246
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:03,728
l thought you meant... Never mind. Yes. Yes.

247
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:08,691
Here's my phone number,
and here's my email.

248
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,571
- Email. That's...
- Yeah. That's funny.

249
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:26,291
- HeIIo?
- Mudwhistle, get dressed. We're goin' out.

250
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:34,256
This Robbins guy gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

251
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,342
Yeah. And then - check this out -

252
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:40,554
he does this thing to me where he makes it
so l can score better with the ladies.

253
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:42,639
At the time l thought it was ajoke.

254
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:46,518
But this afternoon, the first
beautiful woman l saw went for me.

255
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,937
- Could be coincidence.
- Yeah, but no. This was different.

256
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,232
lt was like she went crazy
for me or something.

257
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:57,861
l think maybe talking to him helped my
confidence, cos l do feel more confident.

258
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,199
Shit. Look who's here.

259
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,997
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

260
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,749
- You don't?
- No. Why would l?

261
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,461
- Don't you just get sick of it sometimes?
- Sick ofwhat?

262
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,672
The whole ''l walk on all fours
so l own the world'' thing.

263
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:21,174
Plus all that phony self-deprecating crap.

264
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,719
Jeez... Give the guy a break!
He's got spina bifida!

265
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:29,015
- He's just playing the hand he was dealt.
- Yeah. Here he comes.

266
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:36,313
- There's a couple of belt buckles l recognize.
- Hey, Walt. How you doin'?

267
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:39,191
Do l look like l have
anything to complain about?

268
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:41,985
Not ifyou don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

269
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,404
l gotta go to the can.

270
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:47,157
- Hey, man, good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

271
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:49,826
- How you been?
- Good.

272
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,870
There's a pair of panties l recognize.
How ya doing, Deb?

273
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,997
OK, wise guy, what's it gonna be?

274
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:59,835
- How about a bottle of Dom for my buddy?
- Another? OK, you got it.

275
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,380
- And keep 'em coming.
- What's the occasion?

276
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:06,800
- You don't read the business section?
- What did l miss?

277
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:10,219
- l sold my company to Microsoft.
- Yeah? And you cleaned up?

278
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:13,014
Well, if l had an ass, l'd wipe it with twenties.

279
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,975
All right! Congratulations!

280
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,227
l'm officially retired and on the prowl.

281
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,229
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Sally.

282
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:23,190
l got a leash. Would you like
to take me for a walk?

283
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:24,816
Come on, boy.

284
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,776
Catch ya later.

285
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:35,951
Hi.

286
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:38,954
Hi.

287
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:42,791
- Hal.
- l'm Bella.

288
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:47,795
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

289
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,923
- My friends are all out on the dance floor.
- Yeah?

290
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:55,594
- How come you're not spanking the planks?
- Spanking the planks!

291
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,513
Are they your roommates, or...?

292
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:00,599
No, we work together
at the Foundation Fighting Blindness.

293
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:03,977
Cool. l used to know a deaf guy.

294
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,645
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes!

295
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,022
All right.

296
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,083
What in the name of all that is holy...?

297
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,385
- Do you need help?
- What? Come on!

298
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:46,029
Hal?

299
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:50,491
lt's ten o'clock. We gotta go.

300
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:56,789
- What are you talking about?
- Hal, we gotta go do that thing.

301
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,042
- You know, at the place.
- What thing?

302
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,422
Hey, sorry, ladies.
l gotta steal your dance partner here.

303
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,759
- What are you doing?!
- l am rescuing you.

304
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,886
- From what?
- From what?!

305
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,811
From a pack of stampeding buffalo,
that's from what!

306
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:30,862
Come join us. l'm goin' after the redhead.
You can have your pick ofthe other two.

307
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:35,157
You mean you get the hyena, and l choose
between the hippo and the giraffe?

308
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:40,454
Don't be intimidated, man. They don't bite.
Let's go! l'm gettin' back in there.

309
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,999
Hey, go nuts.

310
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,967
Hey, Jill.

311
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:08,813
Mauricio, it's Hal. Pick it up.

312
00:26:08,896 --> 00:26:12,566
Look, man, l don't know what the hell
was the matter with you last night.

313
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,027
First you wouldn't dance with the hotties,

314
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:19,031
and then we go to the lHOP, and those hotties
are even hotter, and you disappear!

315
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:21,033
Oh, my...

316
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:23,618
l gotta call you back. Something came up.

317
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,894
Building a parachute?

318
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:55,981
- Excuse me?
- They're a little big, aren't they?

319
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:02,195
Oh, l get it. You ripped the spinnaker
on your sailboat, right?

320
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:13,497
Sorry. lt seemed so funny seeing someone
like you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

321
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:16,041
Someone like me?

322
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,544
Yeah. You know, someone so fit.

323
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:21,463
You are ajackass.

324
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,844
Miss, please. l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to offend you.

325
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:32,890
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

326
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:37,436
Whoa, whoa. Let's start over.
Look, that was really dumb of me.

327
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,565
You were probably buying 'em for
someone close to you, and l insulted them.

328
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:44,985
However you took it, l want you to know
l didn't mean to piss you off.

329
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:48,071
l wanted to meet you, and l guess...

330
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:52,908
l guess l'm not real smooth sometimes.

331
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,369
Let me make it up to you.

332
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:58,455
Excuse me, Miss. ls everything all right?

333
00:28:08,214 --> 00:28:12,510
So, what do you do for a living, Rosemary?

334
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:15,638
l'm actually volunteering
at the hospital right now,

335
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,392
cos l'm waiting for
this re-up thing to come through.

336
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:23,562
Re-up? What, are you in the army?

337
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,941
- Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps. Wow.

338
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:30,443
That's very altrudocious ofyou.

339
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,280
''Altrudocious''? That's not a word.

340
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:37,408
Oh! You mean humanidocious, right?

341
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:42,954
- Yeah. That's the one.
- All right. Ready to order?

342
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,040
Yeah.

343
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:53,297
Can l get a double pizza burger, chili fries
with cheese and a large chocolate milkshake?

344
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:57,926
Nicely done. l'll have the exact same thing.

345
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,720
You got it.

346
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:04,516
l am impressed.
lt's nice to see a girl order a real meal.

347
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,310
l hate it when you guys order
a glass ofwater and a crouton.

348
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:09,979
lt ruins the whole point of goin' out.

349
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:12,523
That's probably what l should be ordering.

350
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:17,486
But, l don't know, no matter what l eat,
my weightjust seems to stay the same.

351
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:20,239
So l figure, what the hell?
l'm gonna eat what l want.

352
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:24,117
Totally. lfyou can get away with it,
more power to ya.

353
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,747
- Don't be a smart ass.
- What are you...? What?

354
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,707
No, l'm just saying, you know.

355
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:35,544
l feel bad for people who count calories.
lt's no way to live.

356
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:40,007
Yeah. But in return they get to be
a lot thinner than l am.

357
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:46,971
Are you out ofyour mind?
What do you weigh? 110, 115 pounds?

358
00:29:49,432 --> 00:29:52,226
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

359
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,812
OK.

360
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:56,939
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

361
00:29:57,606 --> 00:30:01,193
Trust me, whatever you're doin',
it's working. lt is working.

362
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:02,694
Go on.

363
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:05,363
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

364
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,241
Oops.

365
00:30:09,492 --> 00:30:13,079
- Goddang it.
- Don't move. ls your back all right?

366
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
- Yeah.
- ls she all right?

367
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:17,875
Yeah. You gotta get
some decent chairs in here, man.

368
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:20,377
What's this shit made out of, anyway?

369
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:23,129
Steel.

370
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:28,259
Yeah? Well, you should
get it welded better in the corners!

371
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:31,304
- All right.
- Rosemary, you sure you're OK?

372
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:36,725
Yeah. l'm a little embarrassed, but
it's happened before, it'll happen again.

373
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,811
Oh, man. l...

374
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:43,690
Don't be embarrassed.
Listen, l beef it. Everybody beefs it.

375
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:47,235
Looks like we're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

376
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:55,826
- Listen, can you wait here one second?
- Hal, just let it go.

377
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:58,162
Nah. Nah.

378
00:30:58,287 --> 00:31:00,497
Hal.

379
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:07,587
You guys are so funny, making fun of me
cos l'm a little pudgy, right?

380
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:12,466
- No, l wasn't making fun ofyou. l was...
- Do me a favor. Take a look out the window.

381
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,262
You see that little fox out there?
You see that little number? She's with me.

382
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:22,851
lfyou took all the women you two have ever
gone out with, they wouldn't equal one of her.

383
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,686
- We're not arguing that.
- No.

384
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,482
That's right. Laugh it up, fellas.

385
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:34,111
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, l'm with her.

386
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,405
All right? That's it.

387
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:41,993
What happened?

388
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:45,914
Well, let's just say the score's
Hal two, mall rats zero.

389
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:48,416
Let me walk you to your car.

390
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,380
- Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.
- My pleasure, Rosie.

391
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:57,341
- My mother calls me Rosie.
- Really?

392
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,842
Yeah.

393
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:03,180
Gentlemen, can l interest you
in some chili fries and half a burger?

394
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,975
There's a lot left cos the little guy
couldn't finish his meal.

395
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,102
- Hey, hey.
- Pussy.

396
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:14,648
- That was nice ofyou.
- Well, you're all right in my book, too, Hal.

397
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,109
- Can l have your number?
- What number?

398
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:19,570
Your PlN number. l want your money.

399
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,364
Your phone number. What do you think?

400
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:24,783
Why?

401
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,869
You know, to go out. Maybe, like, tomorrow.

402
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,004
Well, yeah.

403
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:43,258
l mean, sure. lt's in the book
under Rosemary Shanahan.

404
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,511
- l can write it down. lt's S-h-a...
- No, l'll remember it.

405
00:32:46,553 --> 00:32:50,389
- My boss's name is Steve Shanahan.
- That's my father's name.

406
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,392
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

407
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,394
Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,606
Your father is my boss. l mean,
not my boss, but he's my boss's boss.

409
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:03,318
l mean, l don't know him,
but l see him around the office.

410
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,238
Well, then you won't forget my name.

411
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,170
- Hal?
- Yeah?

412
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:30,093
lf l don't hear from you,
l appreciate everything anyway.

413
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,222
Cuckoo!

414
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,520
You sure you don't want a dog?

415
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:45,148
Yeah, yeah. l'm tryin' to lose a couple of LBs.

416
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,943
- Since when do you care about your gut?
- l don't really, but...

417
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,363
l am a little nervous because of
this girl who's coming to meet me.

418
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:55,407
- She's incredible.
- Uh-huh?

419
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,409
Like the ones on the dance floor?

420
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,496
Even better, buddy. l'm telling ya,
it's almost beyond belief.

421
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,668
She's funny, she's smart,
she teaches self-esteem to sick kids...

422
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:10,713
l would never believe a girl as beautiful
could have such a great personality.

423
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:13,007
- Ugly-duckling syndrome.
- What?

424
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:18,011
She probably wasn't pretty till high school.
The personality developed out of necessity.

425
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:22,099
You know what? l bet you're right.
She's way too pretty to be so nice.

426
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:26,311
Sometimes they're ugly so long,
when they turn pretty, they don't realize it.

427
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:29,689
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

428
00:34:29,731 --> 00:34:32,066
- Hey!
- Hey!

429
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:34,110
l've been looking for you.

430
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:37,654
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy. The girl with the toe.

431
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:40,449
- Hey.
- How ya doing?

432
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,868
Good. Did you get my message?

433
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:48,164
No, no. My phone machine's
not really working there. Did you call?

434
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:52,084
- l got tickets for that Beatles reunion.
- The Beatles?

435
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:56,005
Yeah. Well, not the real Beatles,
but Paul, George and Ringo will be there.

436
00:34:56,046 --> 00:35:00,550
But Eric Clapton is filling in for John.
lt's an invitation-only acoustic set.

437
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:03,470
- Only about 70 people, tops.
- Oh, man.

438
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:05,930
So you're in?

439
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,311
No. Not a Clapton fan.

440
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,523
l think l'll pass.

441
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:20,027
OK. Well, l guess l'll see ya.

442
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,988
- Yeah, yeah.
- Bye, Lindy.

443
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:28,409
- Did you see the toe?
- Mauricio, l gotta tell you, you got issues.

444
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:32,163
- Don't even get me started.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

445
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,123
There's Rosemary.

446
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,001
- Where?
- Right there.

447
00:35:38,127 --> 00:35:41,088
- Right where?
- Straight ahead. Across the field.

448
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:44,841
- ls she behind the rhino?
- She's right there!

449
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:53,933
Mauricio, l want you to meet someone.

450
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:57,978
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

451
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,480
Hi. Nice to meet you.

452
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:04,609
Holy cow. l mean, uh... hi.

453
00:36:07,362 --> 00:36:11,199
- ls that a Members Onlyjacket?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

454
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:14,452
So, what are you, like, the last member?

455
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:17,162
Oh, man.

456
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,373
One-nothing Rosemary.

457
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:23,084
Excuse me forjust one second. Hello?

458
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:26,004
Oh, hi, Mom. Yeah, hold on.

459
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:29,007
- Will you guys excuse me?
- Want something from the snack bar?

460
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:32,343
Yeah, get me a beer
and nachos with all the stuff on it.

461
00:36:32,385 --> 00:36:34,386
You got it.

462
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:39,892
- Does she take the cake or what?
- She takes the whole bakery, Hal.

463
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:44,312
- l told you.
- Yes, you did. And yet l wasn't prepared.

464
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:49,692
- So, what are you up for?
- l don't know. l like the track.

465
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:52,570
Ah, so she's a gambler.

466
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:54,905
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

467
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,284
l hate the ponies. There's too much
human involvement, you know?

468
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:02,913
You can't trust people
ifyou're looking for a fair deal.

469
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:08,084
- What about you? Do you gamble?
- No, not really.

470
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,754
l bet on pro football now and then,
butjust to make the games more exciting.

471
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:14,965
- l don't really care if l win.
- Huh.

472
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:18,093
- l've never read that book.
- What book?

473
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,513
Things Losers Say.

474
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:28,603
Hey, why don't we forget the track, and l'll
introduce you to some good friends of mine?

475
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,146
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

476
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:31,814
- All right.
- What do you say?

477
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:34,608
- l say OK.
- You say OK?

478
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,990
Hi, guys. l want you to meet
a very good friend of mine. OK?

479
00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:45,660
This guy here is Hal. And he's really funny.

480
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:47,704
Hi.

481
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,789
How ya doing? Good to meet ya.

482
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,086
Hey. Wow. Oh, my God. Look at that face.

483
00:37:56,211 --> 00:38:00,215
She should be doing Keebler commercials.
You're the cutest thing l've ever seen.

484
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:03,176
- What's your name, beautiful?
- Cadence.

485
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:07,138
Cadence. That's a pretty name.
You know, my uncle's name is Cadence.

486
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:11,309
Well, l got news for you, Cadence.

487
00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:17,481
l'm not putting you down
until the cows come home.

488
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:20,525
Put her down.

489
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:22,569
The cow came home.

490
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:26,030
What is he doing here?
These aren't visiting hours.

491
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:30,409
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

492
00:38:30,493 --> 00:38:32,953
Fine. Pack it up.

493
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:36,624
And get these patients back in their beds.

494
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:46,424
- Should we get going?
- Don't pay any attention to Nurse Sourpuss.

495
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:48,509
Sourpuss.

496
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:53,723
Hey! l got an idea. Do you guys
wanna play the kissing game?

497
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,810
- Yeah?
- You want me to go get a bottle?

498
00:38:57,893 --> 00:39:00,228
This is how we play. Wanna get the lipstick?

499
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:03,148
- Get lipstick.
- Yeah, OK.

500
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:06,359
What we do is, we put on the lipstick,

501
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:12,073
and then the kisser kisses as many times
as they can until the lipstick comes off.

502
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:14,241
Cool! l wanna go first.

503
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:17,077
- Then l'm going last.
- Jesse.

504
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:22,999
- Hey, they don't have anything l can catch?
- They don't have anything you can catch.

505
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,919
l didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

506
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:28,796
You're just a bunch of phonies
like my Uncle Cadence.

507
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,300
l bet you're here just so you can
get out of school. ls that right?

508
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:35,219
- Yeah.
- Give me some ofthat lipstick.

509
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:39,890
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

510
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:43,602
l'm serious. A lot of people get
really squeamish in that situation...

511
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:47,230
- Rosemary? ls that you?
- Dr Sayed! How's it going?

512
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:50,149
- Good. Who's this?
- This is my friend Hal.

513
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,777
- Good to meet you.
- Be nice to her. She's a good girl.

514
00:39:52,902 --> 00:39:55,654
- All right.
- Bye, Rosemary.

515
00:39:55,779 --> 00:39:57,656
That's what these kids need -

516
00:39:57,698 --> 00:40:01,701
a stranger who isn't afraid to just
be with them and play with them.

517
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:06,873
- That's what builds their self-confidence.
- Why would anybody be afraid of 'em?

518
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:10,168
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

519
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,503
Come on.

520
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:17,674
- This is a nice street you live on.
- Yeah, this is my street.

521
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:21,762
- You wanna come up?
- Yeah. But l don't think l should.

522
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,140
Why not? lt's only 9 o'clock.

523
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:29,519
- l know. l just don't think it's a good idea.
- Oh, no. Did l do something?

524
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,521
No. You've been really cool.

525
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,442
- Hi, Hal.
- Oh, hey, Jill.

526
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:39,861
- Rosemary, this is my neighbor Jill.
- Hi. Nice...

527
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:44,824
- Sorry.
- Nice to meet you.

528
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:46,868
Nice to meet you too, Jill.

529
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:52,123
l gotta go and meet some friends,
so l'll see you guys later.

530
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:53,749
- Bye.
- Bye.

531
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,834
Come up.

532
00:40:57,127 --> 00:40:58,462
- No.
- What?

533
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:01,631
l thought we were having a good time.

534
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:04,926
We were. lt's just, you know,
Hal, l'm not used to all this.

535
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:07,554
Used to what?

536
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:11,349
Hal, you've been really nice to me today.
l really appreciate it, but...

537
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:14,226
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

538
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:17,646
- l don't have other boyfriends.
- Bullshit.

539
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:24,277
Well, l had one boyfriend.

540
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,823
lt was kind of recently,
actually, but it didn't work out.

541
00:41:28,948 --> 00:41:31,284
- You've been burnt, huh?
- No.

542
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:37,289
That's just it. l've never been
close enough to anybody to get burnt.

543
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:42,252
Please! With a mug like that?
You must be fighting 'em off daily.

544
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:46,673
Right. l mean, l saw the way
your friend Mauricio looked at me.

545
00:41:46,714 --> 00:41:50,134
l thought he was gonna shoot me
with a tranquilizer gun and tag my ear.

546
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:56,598
Don't worry. He's been acting really weird
lately, especially around really pretty girls.

547
00:41:56,682 --> 00:42:02,729
Hal, do me a favor and stop saying
that l'm pretty and that l'm not fat, OK?

548
00:42:02,813 --> 00:42:05,565
Cos it makes me uncomfortable.

549
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,693
OK. You have a problem with compliments?

550
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,781
Look... l know what l am
and l know what l'm not.

551
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:19,703
l'm the girl who gets really good grades
and is not afraid to be funny.

552
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:24,165
And l'm the girl who has a lot offriends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

553
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,752
l'm not beautiful, OK? And l never will be.

554
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:30,671
And l'm fine with that. You know?

555
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:35,467
But when you go around saying
that l'm something that l'm not,

556
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,428
it's just... lt's not nice.

557
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,972
Whoa, Rosemary.

558
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:43,266
You're starting to scare me.
l mean, l really like you,

559
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:48,730
but l have to assume you're a little nutty
ifyou really believe you're not beautiful.

560
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,690
Grow up, Hal.

561
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:53,192
Rosie. Wait a second.

562
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,536
Well, it was too good to be true.

563
00:43:06,246 --> 00:43:09,665
Rosemary. Turned out to be a total psycho.

564
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,794
Her self-image is so far off, it's scary.

565
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:17,798
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

566
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:22,302
What are you talking about? All l ever did
was tell her how perfect she was.

567
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:24,262
Really?

568
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:27,390
Yeah. Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

569
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:32,520
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

570
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:36,273
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

571
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:43,071
You're right. l'm probably more immature
than you, but at least l have a bigger willie.

572
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:52,913
Yeah, bigger than a mouse's.

573
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,709
- What the hell was that?
- l said your willie's...

574
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:01,088
l heard what you said,
but it took you, like, eight seconds.

575
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:06,634
You can't come back with a comeback after
eight seconds. You got three. Five, tops.

576
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:09,929
That's why they call it a quip. Not a ''slowp.''

577
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:15,684
All right, you got anything better to read?
l gotta fire off a missile.

578
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:28,154
Hi.

579
00:44:28,237 --> 00:44:31,407
- ls this a bad time, or...?
- No.

580
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:37,204
l just wanted to apologize for last night.

581
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:40,624
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yeah, l do.

582
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:45,420
l called you, like, immature or sophomoric
or something like that. l know you're not...

583
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:49,090
Oh, my God, Hal!
You gotta get in here and look at this turd!

584
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:51,425
lt looks just like Klinger from M*A*S*H.

585
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:58,056
- Why don't we get outta here?
- OK.

586
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,183
Coffee?

587
00:45:09,484 --> 00:45:11,277
Excuse me. Are you ready to order?

588
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:16,031
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers with bacon,
one with relish. Thank you.

589
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:23,205
- Are you OK?
- Brain freeze.

590
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,634
Excuse me, sweetie. Professional.

591
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:48,102
Hey, Billy, stay over near the ladder.

592
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:50,855
Weak. So weak.

593
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:55,776
You wanna see a splash?
l'm gonna show you a splash. Ready?

594
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:21,008
- That was good?
- Billy?

595
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:24,803
Billy? Billy? Billy!

596
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:27,013
Daddy!

597
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:31,350
Sorry.

598
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:50,409
- What's the matter?
- l should have changed at the beach.

599
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:53,454
What? Are you crazy? You look great.

600
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:56,248
l don't normally dress like this
around my parents.

601
00:46:56,332 --> 00:47:00,502
Hey, hey, come on. l'm the one
who should be nervous here, not you.

602
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:08,259
Hey, you know, l've been meaning to ask you.
Were you adopted?

603
00:47:08,384 --> 00:47:10,470
No. Why?

604
00:47:10,553 --> 00:47:12,888
Cos your dad has that weird accent.

605
00:47:13,014 --> 00:47:17,893
And l've seen him around the office. l gotta
say, l don't see the slightest resemblance.

606
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:22,272
Really? Everybody says ifyou put
a wig on him, he'd lookjust like me.

607
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:27,235
Look at who's here now.
Come here, my darlin'.

608
00:47:27,318 --> 00:47:29,028
Hi, Daddy.

609
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:31,739
- Rosie, honey.
- Mom.

610
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:33,824
Good to see ya.

611
00:47:33,824 --> 00:47:36,410
This is Hal Larson,
the guy l was telling you about.

612
00:47:36,535 --> 00:47:38,871
- Great to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

613
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:44,084
- Nice to meet you, Hal.
- The pleasure is mine, Mrs Shanahan.

614
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:47,754
Wow. l can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

615
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:57,596
What the hell... What the hell
is that you've got on?

616
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:01,475
We were at the beach.

617
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,437
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

618
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,108
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to
do that for me. Let's just keep it casual.

619
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:11,692
Casual.

620
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:17,614
Hey, Dad, Hal's one ofyour great
untapped resources down at the company.

621
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:22,953
- Why don't you tell him some ofyour ideas?
- Oh, so you've got a few ideas, do ya?

622
00:48:23,745 --> 00:48:26,414
lt is risky, but the rewards are greater, too.

623
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:31,377
Only a company with a solid reputation
like JPS could ever market this product.

624
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:37,966
- Hal, let me take your plate.
- Thank you. lt was delicious.

625
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:42,304
- Can l get you boys some coffee?
- l'd love a cup oftea, darlin'.

626
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:45,390
Maybe just a drop ofthe hard stuff.

627
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:49,227
Yeah, l'll just have a cup ofjoe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

628
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:54,732
l have to say, Hal,
l'm impressed with a lot ofyour ideas.

629
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:59,695
Some ofthem are dogshit, but for the most
part you seem to have done your homework.

630
00:48:59,778 --> 00:49:02,155
- So l'd like you to do something for me.
- OK.

631
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,284
l'm meeting with me executive committee
Monday morning,

632
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:09,704
and l'd like you to make a presentation.

633
00:49:09,787 --> 00:49:13,207
- Seriously?
- Well, nothing fancy, you understand.

634
00:49:13,332 --> 00:49:16,877
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

635
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,670
Great. l'd love to.

636
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:23,300
Oh, and by the way,
you can cut out the act now.

637
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:25,051
Excuse me?

638
00:49:25,135 --> 00:49:29,389
You think l got as far as l did
in me life by bein' a fool?

639
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:32,350
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and l admire that.

640
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:35,394
Hell, l wish l had a hundred
more like yourself.

641
00:49:35,477 --> 00:49:37,813
We'd be the number one firm in the country.

642
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:41,733
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

643
00:49:41,817 --> 00:49:44,736
l'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

644
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,697
l told you to cut the shit out, all right?

645
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,576
Look, Rosemary's me daughter,
and God knows l love her dearly.

646
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:58,207
But l think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

647
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,835
marching along with the Dallas cheerleaders.

648
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:10,426
l don't understand.

649
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:14,388
l'm telling the truth, Hal.

650
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:19,726
And the truth is l haven't been able to bounce
me daughter on me knee since she was two.

651
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:25,148
You know, l've read about people like you.

652
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:29,944
- People like me?
- Superachievers with impossible standards.

653
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,988
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing ever measures up.

654
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:37,534
lt never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

655
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,662
You think they're an extension ofyou,
like your company,

656
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,833
or your $20-million Learjet
and your Picasso out in the front hall.

657
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:49,170
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

658
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,131
Go on.

659
00:50:52,214 --> 00:50:57,136
When l first met Rosemary, she told me
she knew she wasn't that good-looking.

660
00:50:57,177 --> 00:51:01,515
l could not believe my ears.
l thought how can a person this beautiful

661
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:06,519
possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror
to be anything other than that?

662
00:51:06,603 --> 00:51:08,646
Well, now l know.

663
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:17,112
ls everything OK?

664
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:20,365
Yeah, everything is fine. Just fine.

665
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,875
What?

666
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:33,836
Nothin'.

667
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,297
l just can't believe how lucky l am.

668
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:45,972
You swear to God you're not gonna laugh?

669
00:51:46,014 --> 00:51:48,683
Come on, l'm not gonna laugh.

670
00:51:57,566 --> 00:51:59,234
Daddy like.

671
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:33,015
What in the...? How did...?

672
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:40,856
Get over here, Houdini.

673
00:52:50,156 --> 00:52:51,866
Hi.

674
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:53,951
Yes, l am.

675
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,747
Everything's so perfect.

676
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:01,666
- lt's a little scary.
- l know.

677
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:05,920
But in a good way.

678
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,548
To have so much to lose. That's nice.

679
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:20,892
- l'm gonna call you later.
- OK.

680
00:53:20,976 --> 00:53:23,353
Bye.

681
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:38,659
Forget something?

682
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:40,285
Oh, hey.

683
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:42,913
Hi. l'm glad l caught you
before you went to work.

684
00:53:43,038 --> 00:53:44,205
What's up?

685
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:46,875
l was wondering ifyou wanted
to come over tonight,

686
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:50,753
open a bottle ofwine, maybe watch a video?

687
00:53:50,837 --> 00:53:52,338
Nah. Thanks, though.

688
00:53:57,926 --> 00:54:03,348
And in summation, l feel that these measures
will help JPS and all of our customers.

689
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:13,024
- Nice job, Hal.
- Thank you.

690
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:14,567
- Nicely done.
- l appreciate it.

691
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:17,820
- Hal, l stand corrected.
- Thank you.

692
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:21,406
Hal, l need to see you
in me office straight away.

693
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,366
Sure.

694
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,618
Sit yourself down.

695
00:54:28,663 --> 00:54:30,790
So, what'd you think?

696
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:33,959
l'll be gettin' to that in a minute.

697
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:37,421
l want to talk to you about
that conversation we had the other night,

698
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:40,299
and all ofthem things you said to me.

699
00:54:41,216 --> 00:54:46,179
Well, l'm more than just a little embarrassed,
having said what l said.

700
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:48,848
l think me daughter is lucky to have you.

701
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:52,560
No, sir. l'm the lucky one.

702
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,770
lndeed.

703
00:54:54,812 --> 00:55:00,525
Well, now, as to your meeting in there,
sure, it was first-rate.

704
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,944
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes.

705
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:05,947
Hal, l'm gonna level with you.

706
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,908
- l need your balls.
- Sir?

707
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:12,536
l need a man around that can
give it to me straight, you know?

708
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,997
Whether the news be good or bad.

709
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:21,795
So l've decided - from now on,
you'll be working directly for me.

710
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,343
l don't know what to say, but thank you.

711
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:32,722
Well, a thank you will do just fine.

712
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:39,394
Well, get the fuck out.

713
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,396
OK.

714
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,404
Congratulations on your promot...

715
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:51,948
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no. Come in, come in.

716
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:58,120
l want you to meet Rosemary. Rosemary, this
is Jen and Artie. Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

717
00:55:58,162 --> 00:56:00,038
As in Steve?

718
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,376
Yeah, he's my dad. Oh, God, which
reminds me, l gotta meet him for lunch.

719
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:06,461
So l'll see you this weekend, OK?

720
00:56:10,673 --> 00:56:15,261
lt was really nice to meet you guys.
Do you mind if l take a little sliver?

721
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:23,268
Beauty.

722
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:25,353
Do you want a plate?

723
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,691
l know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

724
00:56:30,775 --> 00:56:34,403
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

725
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,740
The least we could do,
seeing as how you worked so hard

726
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:40,784
to become ''indispensable'' to the company.

727
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,871
ls that that new thing called sarcasm?

728
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:50,293
Hal, we all know you're about as deep as a
puddle. That used to be part ofyour charm.

729
00:56:50,418 --> 00:56:54,672
- But this just flat-out sucks.
- What are you talking about?

730
00:56:54,755 --> 00:56:59,635
lfyou have one ounce of integrity left,
you'll break it off immediately,

731
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:02,304
before you hurt the poor girl.

732
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:14,732
l gotta give you credit for being more
proactive and starting to meet women.

733
00:57:14,815 --> 00:57:16,900
Who knows? Maybe you are on a roll here,

734
00:57:17,026 --> 00:57:20,612
but don't you think it's time
to raise the bar a little?

735
00:57:20,696 --> 00:57:23,865
l mean, at first l thought
you were in a slump, you know?

736
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:27,410
l could, as a friend, look the other way
while you banged a few fatties

737
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:30,955
and got it out ofyour system,
but there's lots of good fish out there.

738
00:57:30,997 --> 00:57:33,249
You don't have to snack on carp anymore.

739
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:37,878
l suppose the girls we partied with a couple
weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp?

740
00:57:37,878 --> 00:57:41,673
No. Laura, the one with the whiskers,
she looked more like a catfish.

741
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:44,759
Oh, l see. And what about Marie?

742
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:48,304
Pop some bolts on her neck
and the villagers'll be chasing her.

743
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:50,056
- And Vicki?
- Who?

744
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:51,641
- Vicki!
- Who's Vicki?

745
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:54,560
VickiVicki. With the short brown hair.

746
00:57:54,602 --> 00:57:57,813
Vicki? l thought that was a guy.
l was calling her Vic!

747
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:02,567
- You're out ofyour mind!
- l know l'm being a little harsh on you here.

748
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:06,279
l think real friends are obligated
to be honest with each other.

749
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:09,532
And this one that you're dating now -jeez.

750
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,701
Careful.

751
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:15,746
Hey, all l'm saying is
she's got cankles, for God's sake.

752
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,123
- What?
- Cankles! She's got no ankles.

753
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:21,877
lt's like the calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

754
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:25,088
l know what cankles are.
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

755
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:28,174
You know what?
l know what you're doing here.

756
00:58:29,008 --> 00:58:31,677
- You're scared.
- Scared?

757
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:36,015
Yup. This is exactly what you did
with the knockout with the weird toe.

758
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,227
You're just inventing reasons
to dump girls cos you're afraid.

759
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:43,063
All right, look,
l admit Rosemary is kind of cool.

760
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:46,024
But you wouldn't even be talking
to that woolly mammoth

761
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:49,527
if her father wasn't
the president ofyour company.

762
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,574
What?

763
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,584
l guarantee you've never met anyone
like this guy. You're gonna love him.

764
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,338
- Great. What's his girlfriend like?
- l don't know. l haven't met her.

765
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,174
Theyjust started going out. Oh, there he is.

766
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:15,342
Walt!

767
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:17,761
At your cervix!

768
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,222
Hey, you recognize these panties?

769
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:23,016
Rosemary, don't steal my lines.

770
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:25,810
- You two know each other?
- Yeah!

771
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:29,313
Gosh, Walt's been volunteering
down at the hospital for years.

772
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:32,692
So where's this mystery girl?

773
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:35,819
She should be here any minute.

774
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:40,240
Hey...

775
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:44,828
l want you to be honest.
ls this outfit too ''Hey, look at me''?

776
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:48,665
No, no. lt's very subtle.

777
00:59:57,089 --> 00:59:59,758
- Sorry l'm late.
- Tanya.

778
01:00:01,051 --> 01:00:03,637
Oh. What a surprise.

779
01:00:21,486 --> 01:00:24,614
- l gotta get a map.
- l'm going with you.

780
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:26,366
What are those for?

781
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:31,204
You ever walked through a truck-stop
men's room on your hands?

782
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:36,792
- Want anything?
- Potato chips. And dip.

783
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:42,130
Cut it out.

784
01:00:43,298 --> 01:00:47,802
So, Tanya, l had no idea that you and Walt
were, you know, seeing each other.

785
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:49,887
Yeah. You got a light?

786
01:00:59,104 --> 01:01:04,067
lt's actually a very funny story. Because he
had been asking me out for a really long time

787
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,611
and l was always kind of unavailable.

788
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:11,490
And then just when he had given up, l broke
up with my boyfriend, and there he was.

789
01:01:11,574 --> 01:01:13,826
So l asked him out.

790
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:16,328
So he kind of grew on you, huh?

791
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:20,040
Exactly. l mean, you gotta admit,

792
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:23,084
when you first meet him, it is kind ofjarring.

793
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:26,629
l mean, you kinda don't even know
what goes where.

794
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:29,882
But, anyway, the timing
couldn't have been more perfect,

795
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:34,762
because he had just sold his company,
and he has all this time on his hands,

796
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:37,389
and we can plan things

797
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:40,309
and travel and go shopping and...

798
01:01:42,352 --> 01:01:44,938
Well, l guess timing's everything.

799
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:51,569
Hope you like bean dip.

800
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:30,062
Yeah! That was my girl.

801
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,523
Oh, my God. l'm the biggest nerd.

802
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:36,068
- Rosemary!
- Ralph!

803
01:02:36,735 --> 01:02:39,112
Hi.

804
01:02:39,196 --> 01:02:41,573
You remember Li'iBoy?

805
01:02:41,698 --> 01:02:43,992
Li'iBoy. Yeah. How are you?

806
01:02:44,743 --> 01:02:46,578
- MahaIo, Rosemary.
- How you doing?

807
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:48,996
- Great.
- Wow.

808
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,501
- They still got you out in Sierra Leone?
- No, no. Now they got me nearer my home.

809
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:56,462
l'm on this island
in the South Pacific called Carabas.

810
01:02:56,545 --> 01:02:59,548
- l'm Hal.
- Oh, l'm sorry. Hal.

811
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:05,553
These are my Peace Corps buddies. This is
Ralph Owens and Li'iBoy. This is Hal Larson.

812
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:07,180
- What's up?
- Li'iBoy.

813
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,810
So, what are you guys doing up here?

814
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,688
Li'iBoy's been stuck in the office
training for 30 days,

815
01:03:15,729 --> 01:03:18,106
so l dragged him here
and threw him on the slopes.

816
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,359
lt wasn't pretty.

817
01:03:20,984 --> 01:03:24,612
l knew this Hawaiian guy in high school
who went out for the hockey team.

818
01:03:24,696 --> 01:03:27,073
lt was funny as shit.

819
01:03:31,369 --> 01:03:34,997
Anyway, it's great to see you again.

820
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:39,376
You look happy.

821
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:42,712
Thanks. l am.

822
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,634
Well, we got a long drive back, so...

823
01:03:50,136 --> 01:03:51,679
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:53,764
Good to meet ya.

825
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,187
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

826
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:06,484
lt's just that... Do you remember
how l told you that once l had a boyfriend?

827
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:08,778
That was him.

828
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:18,704
You're welcome.

829
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,789
What's your name?

830
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:25,001
Excuse me, Mr Robbins.
Could l have a word with you, sir?

831
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,962
- Sure, but l gotta catch a plane.
- lt'll only take a minute.

832
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:31,632
A few weeks ago, you got trapped
in an elevator with a friend of mine.

833
01:04:31,716 --> 01:04:36,136
Hal! He was a great guy. He was having
trouble with his relationships. How is he?

834
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,890
- Well, that's a matter of debate.
- Really?

835
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:42,976
Anyway, apparently,
you gave him, like, a pep talk,

836
01:04:43,101 --> 01:04:47,355
and now he's under the impression
that he can get any woman he wants.

837
01:04:47,438 --> 01:04:50,733
- And you don't think he can?
- l don't know. Whatever.

838
01:04:50,816 --> 01:04:56,530
But, see, the point is,
lately the only women he wants are ugly.

839
01:04:56,655 --> 01:05:00,117
- Who says they're ugly?
- Bausch & Lomb.

840
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,788
And very fat, some ofthem.
lt's like Hal has lowered his whole...

841
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:07,498
Jesus, you've got a big noggin.

842
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,585
Thanks for noticing.
My new book has a chapter on blurting.

843
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,754
- You might wanna pick it up.
- Yeah, l'll check into that.

844
01:05:13,796 --> 01:05:16,548
Anyway, l mean,
did something go wrong here?

845
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:18,926
Or is my friend having a nervous breakdown?

846
01:05:19,009 --> 01:05:22,846
No. Haven't you ever heard the phrase
''Beauty is in the eye ofthe beholder''?

847
01:05:22,971 --> 01:05:26,766
Yeah. Did you ever hear the song
''Who Let The Dogs Out''?

848
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:31,270
- lt can't be that bad.
- Look, exactly what did you do to him, man?

849
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,606
l altered his perception a little bit.

850
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,526
l knew it. l knew it! l knew it!

851
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:40,987
- You messed with his eyesight, right?
- No.

852
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,782
- You hypnotized him.
- No. l dehypnotized him.

853
01:05:43,865 --> 01:05:47,201
He's been hypnotized his whole life,
totally focused on the outside.

854
01:05:47,327 --> 01:05:49,704
l helped him to see
the inner beauty in everyone,

855
01:05:49,787 --> 01:05:52,623
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

856
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:56,794
How can he see their inner beauty
when he doesn't even know them?

857
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,838
lnner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

858
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,341
But how can he not feel them when he's...?

859
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:08,471
The brain sees what the heart wants it to feel.

860
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:11,932
All right, look. Let's just
cut through the old crapcake here!

861
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:13,976
OK.

862
01:06:15,686 --> 01:06:21,733
Sir, don't you think
it's wrong to brainwash someone?

863
01:06:21,817 --> 01:06:23,860
Don't you think you're brainwashed?

864
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:27,697
Everything you know about beauty
is programmed. TV, magazines, movies.

865
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,076
They're all telling you what's beautiful
and what isn't. How's this any different?

866
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,788
Look, l didn't come here to debate you!
l just want my friend back!

867
01:06:35,871 --> 01:06:41,460
Now, isn't there some kind ofword or phrase
or something to take the whammy off him?!

868
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:46,214
Of course. But ifwe do that, he'll go back
to judging everybody by the outside.

869
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:49,926
- ls this what he really wants?
- l don't care what he wants!

870
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:52,720
lt's what l want! l want my friend back!

871
01:06:53,137 --> 01:06:55,848
l gotta go. l gotta catch my plane.
l'm really sorry.

872
01:06:55,931 --> 01:07:00,435
Look, a man's reputation, dignity
and furniture are being trashed here!

873
01:07:00,477 --> 01:07:05,398
Perhaps irreparably!
For God's sakes, his job is in jeopardy!

874
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,651
- His job? Really?
- Yes. And it's a greatjob.

875
01:07:11,988 --> 01:07:15,366
l just wanted to give him a gift.
l didn't want him to get hurt.

876
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:18,035
You seem to know him better than l do, so...

877
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:21,997
- lt's a shame to let it go.
- Oh, it's a tragedy.

878
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,251
So, what did you wanna talk to me about?

879
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,633
- Ralph called me.
- Your old boyfriend Ralph?

880
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:38,137
Well, he was also my division leader
in Sierra Leone.

881
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:44,517
Anyway, he's shipping out to Carabas in ten
days and he wants me to go with his group.

882
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:47,854
What? You and Ralph? Carabas?

883
01:07:47,979 --> 01:07:50,523
They're in the middle
ofthis economic meltdown.

884
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:55,569
100,000 women and children need medical
supplies and food, and they want me to help.

885
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:58,197
How can you be so selfish?

886
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,448
Sorry?

887
01:07:59,573 --> 01:08:03,285
l mean, you know what l'm sayin'.
You bump into pretty-boy Ralph on Friday,

888
01:08:03,368 --> 01:08:07,956
the sparks are flying, and now you're
gonna go and save the world in Carabas?

889
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:11,459
- This has nothing to do with me and Ralph.
- Yeah, right.

890
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:13,878
He's obviously crazy about you.

891
01:08:13,961 --> 01:08:16,130
He's got the heart of a saint.

892
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:20,467
l could practically see the halo
around his head. l can't compete with that.

893
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:24,012
OK, first of all, you're probably
the only person in the Free World

894
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:26,306
to ever refer to Ralph as a ''pretty-boy.''

895
01:08:26,389 --> 01:08:29,851
Secondly, that halo around his head,
it's called psoriasis.

896
01:08:29,976 --> 01:08:33,020
You can't stand within three feet
without getting flaked on.

897
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:36,732
And thirdly, and fourthly, yes,
he's a great guy and he cares about me,

898
01:08:36,774 --> 01:08:39,651
but he had no sense of humor.

899
01:08:39,735 --> 01:08:42,571
And l'm in love with an even greater guy.

900
01:08:43,863 --> 01:08:47,325
Well, then how come l don't have
any say in this thing?

901
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:49,410
You do. That's why...

902
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:54,373
God, are you OK?

903
01:08:56,125 --> 01:09:00,212
- Oh, my God. l am so sorry.
- You should be sorry! This is an outrage!

904
01:09:00,253 --> 01:09:02,964
- l'll go get help.
- Are you OK, sweetie?

905
01:09:03,048 --> 01:09:04,257
Thank you very much.

906
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:06,259
- l'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

907
01:09:06,384 --> 01:09:10,846
lt's this flimsy-ass four-star restaurant.

908
01:09:10,888 --> 01:09:13,891
Just sit right here.
l'm gonna go talk to the manager, OK?

909
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:15,976
l'll be right back.

910
01:09:17,978 --> 01:09:20,022
Good night. Thank you.

911
01:09:21,273 --> 01:09:26,444
l'm not blaming you, but l need a chair. My
girlfriend's jinxed when it comes to furniture.

912
01:09:26,569 --> 01:09:28,988
l'm so sorry.
The waiter told me what happened.

913
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:31,574
Just a sec. Mclntosh's.

914
01:09:35,077 --> 01:09:36,036
Hello?

915
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,956
- ShaIIowHaI wants a gaI.
- What?

916
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,541
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

917
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:45,795
- What the hell are you talking about?
- l just saved your life, baby.

918
01:09:45,879 --> 01:09:48,256
- What?
- l've been looking for you all day.

919
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:51,300
l'm at Mclntosh's with Rosemary.
Look, l got kind of a...

920
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:54,553
- Are you looking right at her?
- No, l'm talking to the hostess.

921
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:56,180
Hal, don't! Hal...

922
01:09:56,305 --> 01:09:59,808
- Look, l got a situation here. l'll call you later.
- Look away!

923
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:06,481
- l was just talking to the hostess.
- Right. That would be me.

924
01:10:06,564 --> 01:10:08,858
No, no. lt was the other hostess.

925
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:11,777
Sir, l'm the only hostess in the restaurant.

926
01:10:12,862 --> 01:10:16,156
Let me apologize about the booth.
We are so sorry.

927
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:21,620
We've replaced your date's side with a new
chair, a strong one, and the meal's on us.

928
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:24,998
Oh, OK. Well, thank you.

929
01:10:25,123 --> 01:10:27,625
You're welcome.

930
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:44,015
Excuse me. Did you move us?

931
01:10:44,099 --> 01:10:46,768
No. Second table on the right.

932
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:52,315
Well, then maybe you can explain to me
why that robust woman

933
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:54,191
is eating my girlfriend's din...

934
01:10:54,275 --> 01:10:56,985
Hey! Now she's eating my clams casino!

935
01:10:59,196 --> 01:11:01,281
Sweetie, are you OK?

936
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:03,450
Excuse me.

937
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:05,535
Mclntosh's. Tiffany.

938
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:07,954
OK.

939
01:11:30,474 --> 01:11:33,060
We're two friends walking. We're just walking.

940
01:11:33,185 --> 01:11:35,813
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what l thought.

941
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:39,316
- Which is?
- You weren't irresistible to women.

942
01:11:39,358 --> 01:11:42,652
He hypnotized you so that
really ugly girls that you met from then on

943
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:45,405
- would, to you, look like supermodels.
- What?

944
01:11:45,488 --> 01:11:49,784
lfthey had inner beauty or some baloney.
You could get any woman you desired

945
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:53,162
because you were suddenly
desiring the undesirable.

946
01:11:53,204 --> 01:11:56,373
- You get it?
- No, not exactly.

947
01:11:56,498 --> 01:12:01,670
Let me put it this way. lt's like
he gave you beer-goggle laser surgery.

948
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:04,297
Now wait a second. So what you're saying

949
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:08,676
is that all the pretty girls l've met lately
are not really pretty?

950
01:12:08,718 --> 01:12:11,304
All right. Let's look at the facts.

951
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:14,557
They were funny, smart and nice.

952
01:12:15,641 --> 01:12:20,228
Pretty girls are not funny!
And they're certainly not nice. Not to us.

953
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:24,232
When l found out what Robbins was doing,
l convinced him to take the trance away.

954
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:29,946
When l said ''Shallow Hal wants a gal,''
you were cured.

955
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:33,657
You're out ofyour mind. Do you know that?
l'm going back to the restaurant.

956
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:36,785
- Hal. Hal, come on.
- Hey, Hal!

957
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:41,915
You never called me back.
What happened to you?

958
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:45,376
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

959
01:12:45,502 --> 01:12:47,503
l've got my hair back.

960
01:12:47,587 --> 01:12:49,630
lt's me - Katrina.

961
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,175
We shared the cab together.

962
01:12:54,593 --> 01:12:59,097
l'm in town taking care of my grandma,
Cos she's been sick, and...

963
01:13:00,432 --> 01:13:03,184
Oh, wait a minute! l get it!

964
01:13:04,269 --> 01:13:07,230
Nice try, Mauricio. Where'd you find this one?

965
01:13:09,982 --> 01:13:12,860
No, it's me - Katrina.

966
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:16,530
From Boston. The magical fruit?

967
01:13:16,613 --> 01:13:20,242
Yes, l remember Katrina.
But the thing is, you're not Ka...

968
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:26,706
l never told you about K...

969
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:31,794
Katrina! How the heck are ya?
Give me some sugar.

970
01:13:33,462 --> 01:13:36,465
l didn't recognize you. The hair and the...

971
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:43,680
You screwed me, man! l had a beautiful,
caring, funny, intelligent woman,

972
01:13:43,805 --> 01:13:46,141
and you made her disappear!

973
01:13:46,224 --> 01:13:52,605
Oh, no, l didn't. l just made Rosemary appear.
There's a difference. lt's called reality.

974
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:58,527
Hey, ifyou can see something and hear it
and smell it, what keeps it from being real?

975
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:00,779
Third-party perspective.

976
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:03,323
Other people agreeing that it's real.

977
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:08,703
OK, let me ask you a question.
Who's the all-time love ofyour life?

978
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,789
Wonder Woman.

979
01:14:11,872 --> 01:14:15,417
OK. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

980
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:19,087
Would it bother you ifthe rest ofthe world
didn't find her attractive?

981
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:21,423
Not at all. Cos l know they'd be wrong.

982
01:14:21,548 --> 01:14:24,884
That's what l had with Rosemary!

983
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:28,680
l saw a knockout!
l don't care what anybody else saw!

984
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:31,849
Jeez, l never thought about it that way.

985
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:40,273
- Hey, l guess l really did screw you, huh?
- What am l gonna do?

986
01:14:40,357 --> 01:14:44,235
Hey, hey, don't panic.
We just get Tony Robbins back here,

987
01:14:44,277 --> 01:14:47,322
he puts the Vulcan mind-meld on ya
and he puts you back under.

988
01:14:47,405 --> 01:14:48,281
Good idea.

989
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:51,242
- ln the meantime you just avoid Rosemary.
- Why?

990
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:56,038
Because ifyou see the real Rosemary,
hypnosis is not gonna help you.

991
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,957
You'll need the jaws of life
to get that image out ofyour head.

992
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:08,633
Hal, open up. lt's me.

993
01:15:14,138 --> 01:15:16,140
l hear you in there.

994
01:15:17,724 --> 01:15:19,726
Just a sec, Rosemary.

995
01:15:25,482 --> 01:15:28,860
What happened to you at the restaurant?

996
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:32,238
l got something in my eye.
l had to run back here and flush it out.

997
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:35,699
Yeah, the hostess said
that you seemed a little cuckoo.

998
01:15:35,783 --> 01:15:38,535
- So, come on, open up.
- l can't.

999
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,371
- Let her in. We'll club her.
- No.

1000
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:43,331
l'm...

1001
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:45,417
l'm very sick.

1002
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,794
l've got, uh...

1003
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:50,379
- CC!
- You have what?

1004
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,258
Contagious conjunctivitis.

1005
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,303
l'll take my chances. Now open up.

1006
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:02,057
All right. ln a minute.

1007
01:16:14,818 --> 01:16:16,904
l told you it was nasty.

1008
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:20,657
Are you OK? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

1009
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:23,743
Nah, nah. l got some drops. l'll be fine.

1010
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,581
- My poor baby.
- Yeah.

1011
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:32,084
Well, l should probably rack out.
This has taken a lot out of me.

1012
01:16:32,168 --> 01:16:34,170
OK.

1013
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:38,549
Well, l'll call you in the morning
and see how you're doing.

1014
01:16:38,632 --> 01:16:41,176
Great, great. Bye-bye.

1015
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,833
Hal, is everything all right with you?

1016
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:19,586
Yeah. Yeah, it's topnotch, sir.

1017
01:17:20,379 --> 01:17:22,172
Why?

1018
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:25,175
Well, it's just that Rosemary's been telling me

1019
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:30,596
that she's having a bit oftrouble getting you
on the telephone the last couple of days.

1020
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,099
Now, l wouldn't be working you
too hard, would l?

1021
01:17:34,934 --> 01:17:37,811
No. l mean, l'm working hard,

1022
01:17:37,895 --> 01:17:41,356
but l guess l've just been
a little preoccupied with things.

1023
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,485
But l'll make sure and touch base with her.

1024
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:49,030
Right. Right.

1025
01:17:50,072 --> 01:17:52,033
OK, then.

1026
01:17:56,829 --> 01:18:02,167
l'm sorry. Apparently Tony Robbins is a lot
tougher to track down than l thought he'd be.

1027
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,420
- l'll come through. l promise.
- l can't keep this up, man.

1028
01:18:05,503 --> 01:18:08,089
Calm down.

1029
01:18:08,172 --> 01:18:12,051
l don't know, Mauricio.
Maybe l should just see her.

1030
01:18:13,219 --> 01:18:15,554
l mean, l do have,

1031
01:18:17,598 --> 01:18:19,725
you know, the heart thing.

1032
01:18:19,808 --> 01:18:23,144
Maybe that's enough
to overcome her appearance.

1033
01:18:23,186 --> 01:18:25,688
lt could be like in that movie -
The Crying Game.

1034
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:28,149
When the guy fell in love
with a beautiful woman?

1035
01:18:28,274 --> 01:18:32,611
And then when he found out it was a guy,
it didn't matter, cos he already loved her.

1036
01:18:32,695 --> 01:18:37,908
Hal, if a set of hairy boys was
your biggest hurdle here, l'd say go for it.

1037
01:18:48,835 --> 01:18:51,420
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1038
01:18:51,504 --> 01:18:53,672
Hey, what's up, Rosemary?

1039
01:18:53,756 --> 01:18:56,592
- Whathappenedyesterday?
- Hm?

1040
01:18:56,717 --> 01:19:00,429
Well, l stopped by your office to say hi,
but you just took off running.

1041
01:19:00,846 --> 01:19:03,306
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No.

1042
01:19:03,348 --> 01:19:06,976
- What were you doing?
- I wasjogging.

1043
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:11,856
- ln your business suit?
- l had a sweat suit underneath.

1044
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,986
ls everything...?

1045
01:19:18,111 --> 01:19:20,822
What's going on, Hal?

1046
01:19:20,864 --> 01:19:23,158
Things haven't felt the same lately.

1047
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,660
- No?
- No.

1048
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:30,122
Hey, Rosemary, don't worry. Everything...

1049
01:19:31,374 --> 01:19:35,127
l'm just in a little funk right now,
and everything's gonna be fine.

1050
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,424
Yeah. So...

1051
01:19:40,465 --> 01:19:42,842
l guess l'll talk to you tomorrow?

1052
01:19:43,635 --> 01:19:44,427
Bye.

1053
01:19:46,095 --> 01:19:48,139
Bye.

1054
01:20:24,923 --> 01:20:29,135
- Who is it?
- Hal, is that you? lt's Jill.

1055
01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:31,220
Comin'.

1056
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:33,889
Hey, what's up?

1057
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:37,142
Hey. My girlfriend just bailed on me,

1058
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:40,854
and l was wondering if l could
take you out to dinner.

1059
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:43,273
l'm sorry. Tonight's not good.

1060
01:20:43,356 --> 01:20:47,110
Don't be such a stiff.
There's some stuff l wanna talk to you about.

1061
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:50,988
- No, really, l can't.
- Please? We'll go outjust as friends.

1062
01:20:52,156 --> 01:20:54,700
Oh, come on. You gotta eat, don't you?

1063
01:20:56,327 --> 01:21:00,038
- Can l ask you something, Jill?
- Yeah.

1064
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:03,333
Why the sudden thaw?

1065
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:07,211
Well, l've been thinking a lot.

1066
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:14,718
Hal, l made a mistake. l never
should have broken it offwith you.

1067
01:21:14,802 --> 01:21:18,430
Well, you didn't really break it off.
We only had that one date.

1068
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:22,976
Besides, you did the right thing. We didn't
have anything in common, remember?

1069
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:26,437
But that was my fault.
l shut you out emotionally.

1070
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:29,857
We could have had more things
in common if l'd wanted to.

1071
01:21:30,608 --> 01:21:33,319
- Mr Shanahan, how are you this evening?
- How am l?

1072
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:36,947
Tonight l feel like a thorn
amongst a bed of roses.

1073
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:40,984
- Your table's ready. John'll seat you.
- Right this way, please.

1074
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:45,488
- l'm just gonna go to the ladies' room.
- OK, Rosie. We'll be at the table.

1075
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:10,219
Yeah. See, why did you shut me out
in the first place? l'm just curious.

1076
01:22:10,344 --> 01:22:15,057
Well, frankly,
l guess l thought you were shallow.

1077
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,018
Me?

1078
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:23,815
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficial dickwad.

1079
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:26,859
l don't know. What do you call it?

1080
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,362
Hal, it's OK.

1081
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:33,907
l've been watching you in the past few weeks.
l've seen the women you've been out with.

1082
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:39,830
And now l know appearances
mean absolutely nothing to you.

1083
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:43,625
lf anything, you're pathologically unshallow.

1084
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:47,003
- l don't know about that.
- lt's true.

1085
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,715
Listen, l have an idea.

1086
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,426
Why don't we get all this food to go?

1087
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:59,222
- Why?
- Because it'll taste a lot better in bed.

1088
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:10,900
You know, there are
a few times in a guy's life -

1089
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:13,986
and l mean two or three, tops -

1090
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:17,322
when he comes to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

1091
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:22,327
lf he goes one way, he can continue what he's
doing and be with any girl who will have him,

1092
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:26,372
and if he goes the other way,
he gets to be with only one woman,

1093
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:28,416
maybe for the rest of his life.

1094
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:32,795
lt seems like by taking the second road,
he's missing out on a lot.

1095
01:23:32,878 --> 01:23:36,048
But the truth is, he gets much more in return.

1096
01:23:36,131 --> 01:23:38,759
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

1097
01:23:39,759 --> 01:23:42,137
God! What am l saying? No!

1098
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:48,434
No, l'm sorry. Jill, this isn't gonna happen. l...

1099
01:23:50,811 --> 01:23:54,189
l think l'm gonna go down
that other road for once.

1100
01:24:04,365 --> 01:24:06,367
- Hi.
- Hello.

1101
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:31,140
Hello?

1102
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:34,852
Hey, hey, hey now. lt's me, your love bunny.

1103
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:38,438
Imiss you andI wanna see you.

1104
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,691
What's the matter? You sound upset.

1105
01:24:41,733 --> 01:24:44,402
What are you, some kind of psycho?

1106
01:24:48,906 --> 01:24:50,908
Hello? Rosie?

1107
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:01,418
Just you leave me daughter alone.

1108
01:25:02,502 --> 01:25:05,838
- l don't understand.
- The jig is up, and she knows it.

1109
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:09,175
Well, she hasn't returned my calls.
What's going on?

1110
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:13,387
lt's a little late to be worrying
about that now, don't you think?

1111
01:25:13,512 --> 01:25:17,557
Besides, she went and accepted
that Peace Corps assignment.

1112
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:23,813
No offense, but l think
l have a right to hear this from her.

1113
01:25:23,897 --> 01:25:25,690
l'll give you your rights.

1114
01:25:25,773 --> 01:25:29,485
l'll give you your last rites,
you self-righteous little shit!

1115
01:25:30,694 --> 01:25:34,114
You know, l wanted to like you. l truly did.

1116
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:39,411
And all ofthat malarkey that you gave me
that night at the house. l bought into it.

1117
01:25:39,828 --> 01:25:43,832
ln spite of all me better instincts,
l took the hook.

1118
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,295
l don't know.
Maybe l share in the blame of it all.

1119
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:54,299
Maybe l just wanted to believe
that there was still a decent guy out there.

1120
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:56,969
A lad that would be right for me daughter.

1121
01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:00,472
- But, sir...
- Don't speak. Just you listen!

1122
01:26:02,474 --> 01:26:06,019
Now, thankfully, as it turns out,
there is a guy out there.

1123
01:26:06,102 --> 01:26:10,398
- His name is Ralph Owens.
- Ral... Pretty-boy Ralph?

1124
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:13,567
Don't be a smart ass. Now you listen to me.

1125
01:26:13,609 --> 01:26:18,071
They're back together,
and me daughter has a chance to be happy.

1126
01:26:18,196 --> 01:26:21,283
And you, you'll be respectin' that.

1127
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:48,015
Excuse me. Could you tell me what floor
Rosemary Shanahan works on?

1128
01:26:48,099 --> 01:26:50,393
l think she's up in Pediatrics.

1129
01:26:50,476 --> 01:26:53,062
- Yeah. That's third floor.
- Thank you.

1130
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:04,364
Hal, is that you?

1131
01:27:04,447 --> 01:27:06,657
Hey.

1132
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:09,118
- What are you doing here?
- l...

1133
01:27:10,411 --> 01:27:13,622
l came to see Rosemary.

1134
01:27:14,706 --> 01:27:17,834
Well, she left early.
She seemed upset about something.

1135
01:27:19,336 --> 01:27:22,422
- Any idea where she went?
- You got me.

1136
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:25,591
Hi, Hal.

1137
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:29,512
Hi.

1138
01:27:31,514 --> 01:27:35,142
- How do you know my name?
- lt's me - Cadence.

1139
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:53,993
Oh, hi, Cadence.

1140
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:00,624
How are you, beautiful?

1141
01:28:00,707 --> 01:28:03,501
How come you haven't come back to see us?

1142
01:28:06,004 --> 01:28:10,299
Well, me and Rosemary have been
having some problems.

1143
01:28:12,384 --> 01:28:15,429
- l was really stupid.
- Oh.

1144
01:28:15,512 --> 01:28:19,683
Well, why don't you go buy her a present
and then maybe you can make up?

1145
01:28:56,508 --> 01:28:58,552
You were right.

1146
01:29:01,638 --> 01:29:06,225
ln the gym last week when you said
l was scared ofwomen, you were right.

1147
01:29:08,769 --> 01:29:13,691
- Nah, l didn't mean that. l was just...
- No, come on, Hal. lt's the truth.

1148
01:29:15,192 --> 01:29:17,361
l'm terrified of 'em.

1149
01:29:17,444 --> 01:29:21,990
l haven't been close to a woman
my whole life.

1150
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,080
l'm a coward, all right?

1151
01:29:38,505 --> 01:29:42,675
But why? l mean, look at you.
You're a mountain of a man.

1152
01:29:42,759 --> 01:29:49,098
You got more style than Mr Blackwell.
You're pulling in what - 28, 29 Gs a year?

1153
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,976
- 29,500.
- You're the perfect catch!

1154
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,853
l know, l know. lt's crazy.

1155
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,940
l just have this thing.

1156
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,318
What thing?

1157
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:07,281
lt's kind of a birth defect thing.

1158
01:30:08,407 --> 01:30:11,118
Jeez, man. l didn't know.

1159
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,579
- What is it?
- l have a tail.

1160
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:19,543
- A tail.
- What do you mean, like a story?

1161
01:30:19,668 --> 01:30:22,629
No, a tail. lt's like a waggy tail.

1162
01:30:23,713 --> 01:30:26,257
My backbone is longer
than it's supposed to be.

1163
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:30,469
lt's like a genetic abnormality.
lt's a vestigial tail.

1164
01:30:30,511 --> 01:30:33,597
- You do not.
- Yeah, l do.

1165
01:30:33,681 --> 01:30:35,182
Get out!

1166
01:30:35,265 --> 01:30:39,936
lf l can't even get my best friend to accept it,
how am l supposed to expect a woman to?

1167
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:44,107
Wait a second. Are you for real?
Cos ifyou are, l gotta see this.

1168
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:48,236
- No, you don't wanna see it.
- No, l don't wanna. l gotta.

1169
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:04,000
- Good Lord!
- All right, you believe me now?

1170
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:06,878
Oh, man. lt really does wag.

1171
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,381
Only when l'm nervous, or happy.

1172
01:31:12,299 --> 01:31:14,301
Wow.

1173
01:31:16,428 --> 01:31:20,515
Have you ever thought about,
you know, maybe getting it cut off?

1174
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:25,228
Cut off? l don't know
why l never thought ofthat

1175
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,857
when l was getting pummeled in gym class
by a bunch of barking seniors!

1176
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,445
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- God!

1177
01:31:37,447 --> 01:31:41,660
The damn thing is wrapped around an artery!
No doctor will touch it!

1178
01:31:41,785 --> 01:31:45,913
Well, it's not so bad.

1179
01:31:47,331 --> 01:31:50,960
l guarantee you there are some girls
who would think it was adorable.

1180
01:31:51,043 --> 01:31:53,712
Like a little puppy dog.

1181
01:31:53,796 --> 01:31:57,341
Really? You think it's like a puppy dog?

1182
01:31:57,424 --> 01:31:59,426
lt's cute as a button.

1183
01:32:01,678 --> 01:32:05,014
- Do you wanna pet the little fella?
- No!

1184
01:32:05,723 --> 01:32:08,434
But, you know, l'm not much of a dog person.

1185
01:32:12,563 --> 01:32:16,400
By the way, you're gonna need
a little sod on the fairway there.

1186
01:32:16,441 --> 01:32:18,902
Huh? What do you mean?

1187
01:32:20,695 --> 01:32:22,781
So, what are you doing right now?

1188
01:32:23,698 --> 01:32:27,368
- Nothing. Why?
- Can l get a lift? l gotta go see someone.

1189
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:28,995
Yeah. Sure.

1190
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,914
Seems like longer than forever, yeah

1191
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:34,875
My home is now a distant land

1192
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:38,754
lf l had one wish, l wish you could be

1193
01:32:38,795 --> 01:32:41,631
Back on that rock in the middle ofthe sea

1194
01:32:41,673 --> 01:32:45,301
My heart is calling me to the islands

1195
01:32:45,385 --> 01:32:48,346
My home is now a distant land

1196
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:52,057
lf l had one wish, l wish l could be

1197
01:32:52,141 --> 01:32:54,435
Back on that rock

1198
01:32:54,852 --> 01:32:57,729
Hey! Hal, right?

1199
01:32:59,064 --> 01:33:01,650
- Have we met?
- lt's me, Li'iBoy.

1200
01:33:03,735 --> 01:33:06,696
l met you up in the mountains with Ralph.

1201
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:11,242
- Oh, yeah, Li'iBoy. How ya doing?
- Yeah.

1202
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:14,828
- You look like you been working out.
- Nah.

1203
01:33:15,287 --> 01:33:17,831
So, do you know if Ralph is in the office?

1204
01:33:18,373 --> 01:33:20,208
Yeah. Ralph!

1205
01:33:23,211 --> 01:33:25,922
Hal! Hey, Hal.

1206
01:33:26,923 --> 01:33:29,425
Hey. How ya doin'?

1207
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:33,929
l'm doing great. You're looking good.
So, what can l do you for?

1208
01:33:36,098 --> 01:33:39,893
- l came here to congratulate you.
- On...?

1209
01:33:40,435 --> 01:33:42,395
Look,

1210
01:33:43,229 --> 01:33:46,232
you got a great girl, and you deserve her.

1211
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:53,280
More than me. And the truth is,
l'm happy for Rosemary.

1212
01:33:54,156 --> 01:33:58,368
But l want you to understand one thing.
You better be good to her, Ralph.

1213
01:33:58,452 --> 01:34:02,288
Ralph, ifyou ever mess up
and make her unhappy,

1214
01:34:02,372 --> 01:34:06,084
l'll be waiting in the wings,
and l'll pounce on you. Like a tiger!

1215
01:34:06,167 --> 01:34:10,880
Like a tiger on a deer,
with a cloven hoof and with a broken arm!

1216
01:34:10,963 --> 01:34:13,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hal.
What are you talking about?

1217
01:34:13,716 --> 01:34:16,093
You're back together. Let's not play games.

1218
01:34:16,176 --> 01:34:19,387
- Rosemary and l aren't back together.
- You're not?

1219
01:34:20,347 --> 01:34:25,727
Let's put it this way. Her parents are throwing
a going-away party for her as we speak.

1220
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:28,229
l wasn't even invited.

1221
01:34:44,953 --> 01:34:47,622
- This seems crazy.
- Yeah. That's cos it is.

1222
01:34:47,705 --> 01:34:50,499
- But crazy's all you got.
- Amen to that.

1223
01:34:53,252 --> 01:34:55,254
Good luck, Hal.

1224
01:35:08,849 --> 01:35:13,771
Well, l could use a drink. What do you say
we slide around the side here?

1225
01:35:13,854 --> 01:35:16,231
Yeah, we'll blend in.

1226
01:35:17,357 --> 01:35:18,692
Yeah.

1227
01:35:21,403 --> 01:35:23,363
Hello?

1228
01:35:27,533 --> 01:35:29,535
- Rosie?
- Excuse me. What are you...?

1229
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:35,415
l love you. l'm not going anywhere
until you hear me out.

1230
01:35:51,097 --> 01:35:53,098
What are you doing?

1231
01:35:55,767 --> 01:35:58,437
- Who are you?
- Who am...?

1232
01:35:58,478 --> 01:36:02,023
Hal, are you drunk? lt's me, Mrs Shanahan.

1233
01:36:03,316 --> 01:36:07,320
l have some things to say to your daughter.
l'm not leaving here until l do.

1234
01:36:07,445 --> 01:36:12,241
OK. But could you release Helga
so she can get back to work?

1235
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:31,884
Get ready, Li'iBoy. lt's showtime.

1236
01:36:35,929 --> 01:36:38,932
Well, Hal, now's your chance.

1237
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:12,046
What are you doing here?

1238
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:15,716
Oh, my God. You're beautiful.

1239
01:37:17,175 --> 01:37:20,136
You have no right to be here.

1240
01:37:22,138 --> 01:37:25,266
- Hal, come on. This isn't working out.
- l'm OK.

1241
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:27,768
What the hell are you doing here?

1242
01:37:30,104 --> 01:37:33,399
- l'm having a word with your daughter.
- lt better be ''goodbye''!

1243
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,984
- You've got her all up...
- Steve! Shut up.

1244
01:37:42,615 --> 01:37:45,451
Rosemary, l am so sorry that l hurt you.

1245
01:37:46,411 --> 01:37:49,121
l've been really dumb.

1246
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:53,167
l'm immature, l'm unthoughtful,
l'm a friggin' idiot.

1247
01:37:56,420 --> 01:38:01,007
But l love you.
You're the only girl l've ever loved.

1248
01:38:03,259 --> 01:38:07,763
And l just didn't want you to go away
without knowing that.

1249
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:18,106
You really hurt me.

1250
01:38:18,231 --> 01:38:24,779
l know. But ifyou'll let me, l wanna spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

1251
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:32,119
Well, your timing is terrible.

1252
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:36,999
l mean, l'm leaving for Carabas
tonight for 14 months.

1253
01:38:40,877 --> 01:38:44,255
l'm sorry, Rosemary.
l just can't wait that long.

1254
01:38:46,507 --> 01:38:48,551
l understand.

1255
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:53,055
Which is why l'm going with you.

1256
01:38:57,976 --> 01:39:00,061
What?

1257
01:39:00,145 --> 01:39:05,400
lt's true, Rosie. Big Kahuna here just swore
him into the Corps about a half-hour ago.

1258
01:39:05,483 --> 01:39:07,527
That's right. He's official.

1259
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:12,823
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?

1260
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,078
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

1261
01:40:26,349 --> 01:40:28,559
- Here's your bag, Rosemary.
- Thank you.

1262
01:40:28,684 --> 01:40:30,936
- Congratulations, Hal.
- Thank you.

1263
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:32,396
- Rosemary.
- Bye.

1264
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:36,733
Just keep it right there at the airport.
l'll pick it up later. Congrats.

1265
01:40:36,733 --> 01:40:39,194
- We love you, Rosie.
- l love you, Mom.

1266
01:40:40,362 --> 01:40:43,781
And, Rosemary, you'd better
be looking after me lad.

1267
01:40:43,865 --> 01:40:45,783

1268
01:40:47,618 --> 01:40:48,953

1269
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:02,173
Say bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1270
01:41:09,472 --> 01:41:12,391
You like puppy dogs, do ya?

1271
01:41:12,474 --> 01:41:14,852
Anything to do with dogs, l melt.

1272
01:41:17,062 --> 01:41:20,148
Why don't we go around back,
get a little drink?

1273
01:41:20,232 --> 01:41:22,650
- Sure.
- Yeah? Come on, big fella.

1274
01:48:43,763 --> 01:48:48,392
Hey, kid. How 'bout these Rossi boots?
Do they fit like a glove or what?
