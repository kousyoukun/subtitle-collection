1
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:46,732
Mrs. Larson?

2
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,617
It, uh...

3
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,913
It won't be much longer, Mrs. Larson.

4
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,044
Well, is he in a lot of pain?

5
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:12,048
No. No, no. There will be
No more pain for your husband.

6
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,592
He's heavily sedated.

7
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:19,263
OK. I think I'm gonna go
send little HaI in now.

8
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,557
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

9
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,852
With all the pain killers, uh...

10
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,647
the reverend's not exactly himself.

11
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,359
Look, I think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

12
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:35,946
I mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

13
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,452
Well... your call.

14
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:45,913
Nurse?

15
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,334
Yes, Reverend Larson?

16
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:54,130
- Did you see the cowboy?
- The cowboy?

17
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,175
The cowboy who gave me
the singing nickeI in Pudding Town?

18
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:03,597
OK. I think it's time
to turn down the morphine drip.

19
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:11,437
Reverend Larson, your son is here.

20
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,692
OK, sure. Send her in.

21
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:18,736
Ladies? A little privacy.

22
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,922
Dad?

23
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:42,718
It's me, Dad. HaI.

24
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,848
Oh.

25
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:51,935
Glad you're here, kiddo.
Got a few things to tell ya.

26
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:59,734
First, I want you to promise
that no matter what you do in life,

27
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,945
you will never ever settle for average.

28
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,948
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:10,703
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

30
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,831
Huh?

31
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,541
Don't do what I did.

32
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:21,880
I married for love, and your mother
Betty has been a nightmare.

33
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:25,425
But, Dad, Mom's name is Marian.

34
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:29,763
Listen to me. I'm giving you pearls here.

35
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:35,227
And third, find yourself...

36
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,272
a classic beauty...

37
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:46,237
with a perfect can... and great totties.

38
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:51,659
That will put you in good stead
with the Lord. It's all in here.

39
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,330
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:57,206 --> 00:04:01,919
Hot young taiI's what it's all about.

41
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:08,716
Hot... young... taiI.

42
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,528
I'll make you proud, Papa.

43
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:15,322
* Uncle Larry's hooked on ice again

44
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:22,954
* He seems to be stuck in the '80s

45
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:30,670
* He wears his Members Only jacket

46
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:38,928
* Cos he thinks it turns on all the ladies

47
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:46,977
* And all the white folks shake their asses

48
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:53,818
* Looking for the two and four

49
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:02,367
* I'll have mine in martini glasses

50
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:09,207
* Cos I can't take it any more

51
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:21,970
* These are the days of empty kitchens

52
00:06:24,388 --> 00:06:29,810
* The rise and fall of Mary Ellen's hair do...

53
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,606
Jackass, can you not hear me down there?

54
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,402
I don't want anything to do with you,
you little warthog.

55
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,988
You had me at "Get lost".

56
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,033
- What's up, Mauricio?
- Hey, HaI.

57
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:49,662
- How's the crowd tonight?
- Good. I got a few bites.

58
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:52,874
- Can I get you a drink?
- I won't say no to that.

59
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,295
Two beers.

60
00:06:57,378 --> 00:07:00,006
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

61
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,801
So, I didn't expect to see you here.
Where's your new girI Loni?

62
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,887
- Lindy.
- Lindy.

63
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,890
- She's, uh...
- There you go.

64
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:12,392
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was goin' out tonight.

65
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,561
Why not? Things OK with you guys?

66
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:18,398
Yeah, a little too OK,
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

67
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,944
- What does that mean?
- Things are going in the shitter reaI quick.

68
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,323
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

69
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,534
- She's not. I'm dumping her.
- You're dumping Loni?

70
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:33,204
- Lindy.
- What, are you crazy? Lindy's gorgeous.

71
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:37,833
On the surface, but when you get to know her
better, there's a whole other story goin' on.

72
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,085
Yeah? How goes that?

73
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:45,633
We're sitting there, you know, and
she's got her bare... feet up on the couch,

74
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:50,721
and I notice that her second toe is, like,
half an inch longer than her big toe.

75
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:56,267
- That's it? You're breaking up over that?
- Hey, I don't need that circus shit.

76
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,854
Well, couldn't she get the toe
filed down or something?

77
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,690
What, then I'm dating a nub?

78
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm starting to think we're jinxed here.

79
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,947
- Speak for yourself, my friend.
- What, you got the promotion?

80
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,577
I don't hear till tomorrow, but guess who
is now officially going out with Jill.

81
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,873
Jill?! Your neighbour Jill?
You're going out with Jill, your neighbour?

82
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,416
And she doesn't exactly hate me.

83
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,253
Get out!

84
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:29,007
You are the luckiest man on the planet.
So what are you doing here?

85
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,010
She's hostessing untiI 11. I better get going.

86
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:35,889
I'm gonna try to catch her on the way home,
see if she wants to get a drink.

87
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,101
If I know you, that's not all she'll be gettin'.

88
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,395
See you later.

89
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:46,274
- I said no.
- No? Why not?

90
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:51,988
I don't wanna have a drink with you. I wanna
go home. Is that so hard to understand?

91
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:57,326
- What's goin' on? Are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I just...

92
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:01,873
Go on, say it. You know what?
No matter what it is, we're gonna work it out.

93
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:06,376
HaI, I'm not attracted to you.

94
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:12,632
So what? You think everyone who goes out
is attracted to each other? Get reaI.

95
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,510
They're attracted to each other
in the beginning.

96
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:19,347
Oh, come on. That sounds
like a bunch of New Age hooey.

97
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:24,102
Maybe for some people
there's a little spark in the beginning,

98
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:28,398
but for most, the attraction part
happens way later. Whoa!

99
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,152
What? That's it?
Just like that, we're breaking up?

100
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:36,739
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

101
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:40,993
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all I need.

102
00:09:41,076 --> 00:09:45,289
- Why do you need five days?
- Tomorrow I'm finally getting my promotion.

103
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:49,126
There's gonna be parties, dinners,
this, that. I need you now.

104
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:52,504
HaI, you're gonna be so busy,
you won't even think about me.

105
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:56,174
How am I not gonna think about you?
You live right across the hall.

106
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:01,179
I don't know, HaI. Maybe...
maybe you should think about moving.

107
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:19,363
HaI, we've made a decision
regarding that wholesaler position.

108
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:22,366
Yes! It's about time, Dave.

109
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:26,411
We decided to go with the gaI from Merrill.

110
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:29,998
She's a proven entity. A big producer.

111
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,294
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, it's...

112
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:39,006
The gaI's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

113
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:44,512
- HaI, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

114
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:48,391
- You should have gotten it. You deserved it.
- No, I didn't.

115
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:52,270
I didn't put them in a position
where they had to promote me or lose me.

116
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:56,566
It's a good lesson.
Make yourself indispensable, that's the key.

117
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:00,236
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

118
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,864
Dumped you? Don't you have to be
going out to get dumped?

119
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:07,909
- What does that mean?
- Well, I just thought it was more of a...

120
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:12,414
Anyway, why do you care so much?
Jill wasn't right for you and you know it.

121
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:15,041
How can you say that? She was perfect.

122
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,628
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

123
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,339
And by the way, her tits weren't even reaI.

124
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:25,259
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's reaI enough for me.

125
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,928
HaI, I don't understand how a guy

126
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:33,934
who's as nice and loyaI and generous as you
could have such a huge flaw.

127
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,061
What are you talking about?

128
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:41,066
It never occurred to you that picking girls
on their looks may not be the best way?

129
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,320
Am I supposed to apologise
for having high standards?

130
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:48,157
High standards? In the five years
I've known you, every woman -

131
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,535
I should say girI - you've gone after
has been completely out of your league.

132
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:56,081
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.

133
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:59,793
She's just saying
you're not that good-looking.

134
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:03,088
Oh! I thought she was implying
something really mean.

135
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:05,006
No.

136
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,446
Hey, it's you. You're the TV guru guy.

137
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,450
- Yes, Tony Robbins. Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah! Oh, man!

138
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:36,828
So, wow! You gave advice
to what chama call it.

139
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,288
- President Clinton? Mandela?
- No, no, no.

140
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:41,999
- Gorbachev?
- No, no. Pamela Anderson.

141
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,003
Right? Yeah! Give me another handshake.

142
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:50,716
Wow! Man, look at those mitts!
It's like grabbing a bunch of bananas.

143
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,718
And those dogs. How big are those?

144
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:55,346
- Size 16, buddy.
- Holy cannoli.

145
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,974
- So you must do pretty good with the ladies.
- Just one.

146
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,143
- Really?
- Yeah.

147
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:06,064
She sounds hot!

148
00:13:06,148 --> 00:13:08,817
- She is an amazing lady.
- I bet.

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,779
- So, what are you doin' in my town?
- We're doing a seminar here.

150
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:17,200
I help people to deaI with the challenges
in life with more dignity and courage.

151
00:13:17,284 --> 00:13:20,203
That's my deaI, is the courage. I try to...

152
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:25,166
Hang on a second. Buddy, hang on.
The elevator just stopped. That's weird.

153
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,334
- Man, yeah. So what do we...?
- Hang on.

154
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:30,004
- Are you OK? I'm fine.
- You OK?

155
00:13:30,087 --> 00:13:33,340
Yeah, yeah. It's just I feeI a little light-headed.

156
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:43,517
Then she dumped me. Flat out. Without
even the courtesy of a severance pop.

157
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,728
- A severance pop?
- You know, one last...

158
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:52,317
To ease the pain. The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

159
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,111
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

160
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:58,490
Yeah. See, the problem is I'm kinda picky.

161
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:04,579
- What do you mean, "picky"?
- Well, for instance, I like 'em reaI young.

162
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:08,874
Like, did you ever see Paulina
in her first Sports lllustrated layout?

163
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:13,170
- You're looking for a young Paulina type?
- That face, but with better headlights.

164
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,548
You know how hers
have kind of dimmed lately?

165
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:19,343
Heidi Klum's beams would do. And her teeth.

166
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,721
Or that Britney Spears girI.
She's got great knockers.

167
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:25,432
But she's a tad muscular.

168
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:29,728
Actually, you know what? Her ass would do,
too, if she had a better grille.

169
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:32,772
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

170
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:36,109
But she'd have to be
a little smilier than Michelle.

171
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:39,737
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

172
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,866
But not as skinny. Someone meatier,
like Heidi, but without the accent.

173
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,953
You know those accents: yah-yah-yah-yah.

174
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:51,707
They really get old fast. You know
what I'm saying. Someone like that.

175
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:56,211
Don't you think you're being a little bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

176
00:14:56,294 --> 00:15:01,466
Well, no. I mean, you know,
I'd like her to be into culture and shit, too.

177
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,803
OK, hypotheticaI situation.

178
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:09,558
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

179
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:12,686
Ooh, toughie. That's a toughie.

180
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:15,981
How's the remaining breast? Is it big?

181
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:21,110
- How's your relationship with your parents?
- Excellent. I mean, my mom's hilarious.

182
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:23,404
She golfs every afternoon.

183
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:27,658
Actually, I don't really remember my dad.
He died when I was nine, so...

184
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,411
If you were nine, you should remember a lot.

185
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,413
Yeah, but I don't.

186
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:36,542
My mom thinks I might have been
a little traumatised by the whole thing.

187
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,171
Anyway, all I remember is, he was great.

188
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:43,673
He was a great guy,
and I really loved him, but...

189
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm sorry you lost him.
Hey, listen, I know you got a great heart.

190
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:51,681
You're just fixated on
the outside appearances of people.

191
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:54,726
- HaI Larson, I'm gonna do you a great favour.
- Really?

192
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:59,522
This is how it'll work. From this moment on,
whenever you meet someone in the future,

193
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:02,025
you're only gonna see what's inside them.

194
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:07,446
So you'll respond to that, because that,
my friend, is where the true beauty lies.

195
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,365
OK, Tony, I think
you're getting a little cabin fever.

196
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:13,202
Hold on. What if I told you by doing this,

197
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:17,414
you could have the most beautifuI women
in the world and they'd want you?

198
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:21,627
- Is this like what you do in your seminars?
- No, no, this is very speciaI.

199
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,923
This is just between you and me.
Let's get up and I'll show you what to do.

200
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:29,967
Now, you got a pattern of looking at women
and judging them by the exterior.

201
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:33,930
We gotta break that pattern.
So has there been a time

202
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:38,184
when you were especially shallow with a
woman, where you thought you were better?

203
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,894
- All the time.
- All the time.

204
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:42,855
Is there one specific time
where you were really shallow?

205
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,441
- Oh, yeah, I got one.
- Think about that.

206
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,735
Devils, come out!

207
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,405
- What the hell are you doin', banana hands?
- Just hang on.

208
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:54,533
- We gotta jolt your nervous system.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

209
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:59,121
It's not just talking about it. Here's what
I want you to do. Just relax for a moment.

210
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:03,291
- I won't do that again.
- I didn't mean the "banana hands" thing.

211
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:08,505
Close your eyes. Just relax. And I want you
to imagine that you're on a beach.

212
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:12,384
It's a warm day and the sun
is just starting to set.

213
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:17,388
And you're looking in the eyes of a woman,
and you're feeling her heart.

214
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,974
You're seeing her souI.

215
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:23,769
You're feeling her spirit.

216
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,564
That's it. That's it.

217
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,150
Excellent. Excellent.

218
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,784
Taxi!

219
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,537
Oh.

220
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:46,291
I'm sorry. I... I thought that...

221
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:51,588
No, it's my fault. I didn't see you.
This is your cab. I'm gonna get the next cab.

222
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,384
- OK.
- All right.

223
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:02,514
Look, I'm just... I'm just
headed over to the East Side.

224
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,518
- Do you wanna share, or...?
- Yeah!

225
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:11,231
Yeah, let's take this one.
So, awesome. Thank you. Terrific.

226
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,903
- Where to?
- East Side Plaza for me, please.

227
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,489
Likewise.

228
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:36,506
- What?
- Oh. Huh? Sorry. I just...

229
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,177
I mean, yeah, you're... you're really pretty.

230
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:48,517
Yeah, right. Jeez,
is everybody in this city so flattering?

231
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:52,312
I figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

232
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,481
- Boston.
- Bean Town.

233
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,567
The musicaI fruit.

234
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:01,279
The more you eat, the more you... toot.

235
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,535
So, are you here on a shoot or something?

236
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:10,789
- A shoot?
- I mean, you must be a modeI, right?

237
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:24,385
My grandmother's not doing so well, so I
took a year off from schooI to help her out.

238
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:27,346
Oh. Helping granny. CooI.

239
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,857
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

240
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,943
Bye.

241
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:45,780
So, nice catchin' up.

242
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,000
Listen, um... I know you'll probably think
I'm some kind of wacko for asking, but, um...

243
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,419
What?

244
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:04,047
Well, while you're here in town,
I mean, you know...

245
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:09,762
If you ever feeI like taking a break from
hangin' out with your old sick granny,

246
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,431
you know, we could...

247
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,184
- Sure. I mean...
- Really?

248
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:18,145
Are you kidding? Yeah! That'd be...

249
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:20,522
I would absolutely love to, if...

250
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:23,399
OK, yeah. I should get your number, then.

251
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,652
No, no. I'll get yours, because it would...

252
00:20:26,736 --> 00:20:30,156
- With my luck, you'll lose mine, so...
- Oh. I get it.

253
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:33,284
Very funny. You got me.
That was... No, that was good.

254
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:37,455
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile. That was harsh.

255
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:40,041
- I don't need this shit.
- Uh...

256
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,168
What?

257
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,504
- I... I do want your number.
- Oh, I'm sorry!

258
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:49,674
I don't know what... That was dumb.
I was saying something...

259
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:53,261
I thought you meant... Never mind. Yes. Yes.

260
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:58,475
Here's my phone number,
and here's my emaiI.

261
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,605
- EmaiI. That's...
- Yeah. That's funny.

262
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:16,951
- Hello?
- Mudwhistle, get dressed. We're goin' out.

263
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,167
This Robbins guy gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

264
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,378
Yeah. And then - check this out -

265
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:31,673
he does this thing to me where he makes it
so I can score better with the ladies.

266
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:33,842
At the time I thought it was a joke.

267
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:37,929
But this afternoon, the first
beautifuI woman I saw went for me.

268
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:41,516
- Could be coincidence.
- Yeah, but no. This was different.

269
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,936
It was like she went crazy
for me or something.

270
00:21:44,978 --> 00:21:49,733
I think maybe talking to him helped my
confidence, cos I do feeI more confident.

271
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:54,236
Shit. Look who's here.

272
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:01,410
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

273
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:04,246
- You don't?
- No. Why would I?

274
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:08,167
- Don't you just get sick of it sometimes?
- Sick of what?

275
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,503
The whole "I walk on all fours
so I own the world" thing.

276
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:14,173
Plus all that phoney self-deprecating crap.

277
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:17,800
Jeez... Give the guy a break!
He's got spina bifida!

278
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:22,263
- He's just playing the hand he was dealt.
- Yeah. Here he comes.

279
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,812
- There's a couple of belt buckles I recognise.
- Hey, Walt. How you doin'?

280
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:32,857
Do I look like I have
anything to complain about?

281
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,777
Not if you don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

282
00:22:35,818 --> 00:22:38,279
I gotta go to the can.

283
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:41,156
- Hey, man, good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

284
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,867
- How you been?
- Good.

285
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,162
There's a pair of panties I recognise.
How ya doing, Deb?

286
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,372
OK, wise guy, what's it gonna be?

287
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:54,377
- How about a bottle of Dom for my buddy?
- Another? OK, you got it.

288
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,090
- And keep 'em coming.
- What's the occasion?

289
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:01,676
- You don't read the business section?
- What did I miss?

290
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,262
- I sold my company to Microsoft.
- Yeah? And you cleaned up?

291
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:08,182
Well, if I had an ass, I'd wipe it with twenties.

292
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:11,227
All right! Congratulations!

293
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,604
I'm officially retired and on the prowI.

294
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:15,648
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Sally.

295
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:18,776
I got a leash. Would you like
to take me for a walk?

296
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:20,486
Come on, boy.

297
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,488
Catch ya later.

298
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,038
Hi.

299
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,208
Hi.

300
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:39,212
- HaI.
- I'm Bella.

301
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,384
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

302
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,679
- My friends are all out on the dance floor.
- Yeah?

303
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:52,516
- How come you're not spanking the planks?
- Spanking the planks!

304
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,518
Are they your roommates, or...?

305
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:57,730
No, we work together
at the Foundation Fighting Blindness.

306
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:01,316
CooI. I used to know a deaf guy.

307
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,068
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes!

308
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:05,529
All right.

309
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:27,300
* Baby, when I saw you
turning at the end of the street

310
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:35,349
* I knew a time was gone
and it took me like ages

311
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:39,978
* Just to understand that
I was afraid to be a simple guy

312
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,856
* I tried my best to smile

313
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,442
* But deep inside my heart

314
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,196
* I felt it was shouting like a crowd dancing

315
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,157
* I guess I couldn't live without the things

316
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,868
* That made my life what it is

317
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,330
* Can't you hear me calling?

318
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,332
* Ooh, yeah

319
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:05,169
* Everybody's dancing

320
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:07,338
* Ooh, yeah

321
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,133
* Tonight everything is over

322
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:14,428
What in the name of all that is holy...?

323
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:18,641
* I can't lie on my bed
without thinking I was wrong

324
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:23,187
* But when that feeling calls...

325
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,189
- Do you need help?
- What? Come on!

326
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,943
* Night-time won't hold me in your arms again

327
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:33,822
* I got a very good friend who says

328
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:37,242
* He can't believe the love I give

329
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:40,161
* Is not enough to end your fears

330
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:42,789
* I guess I couldn't live without the things

331
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,500
* That made my life what it is

332
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,668
HaI?

333
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:52,339
It's ten o'clock. We gotta go.

334
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:58,887
- What are you talking about?
- HaI, we gotta go... do that thing.

335
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:02,391
- You know, at the place.
- What thing?

336
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:07,938
Hey, sorry, ladies.
I gotta steaI your dance partner here.

337
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:12,483
- What are you doing?!
- I am rescuing you.

338
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,652
- From what?
- From what?!

339
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:23,995
From a pack of stampeding buffalo,
that's from what!

340
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,463
Come join us. I'm goin' after the redhead.
You can have your pick of the other two.

341
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:38,925
You mean you get the hyena, and I choose
between the hippo and the giraffe?

342
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:44,431
Don't be intimidated, man. They don't bite.
Let's go! I'm gettin' back in there.

343
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:48,143
Hey... go nuts.

344
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:53,398
* Tonight everything is over

345
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:55,776
* I feel too young

346
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,570
Hey, Jill.

347
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,328
* Everybody's shaking...

348
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,085
Mauricio, it's HaI. Pick it up.

349
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:18,005
Look, man, I don't know what the hell
was the matter with you last night.

350
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:20,507
First you wouldn't dance with the hotties,

351
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,677
and then we go to the IHOP, and those hotties
are even hotter, and you disappear!

352
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:26,805
Oh, my...

353
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:29,474
I gotta call you back. Something came up.

354
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,241
* In the sky the birds are pulling rain

355
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,997
* In your life a curse has gota name

356
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,961
Building a parachute?

357
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:03,215
- Excuse me?
- They're a little big, aren't they?

358
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:09,762
Oh, I get it. You ripped the spinnaker
on your sailboat, right?

359
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:21,482
Sorry. It seemed so funny seeing someone
like you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

360
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,152
Someone like me?

361
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,738
Yeah. You know, someone so fit.

362
00:28:27,697 --> 00:28:29,782
You are a jackass.

363
00:28:32,284 --> 00:28:36,455
Miss, please. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

364
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:41,710
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

365
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:46,465
Whoa, whoa. Let's start over.
Look, that was really dumb of me.

366
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:50,761
You were probably buying 'em for
someone close to you, and I insulted them.

367
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:54,263
However you took it, I want you to know
I didn't mean to piss you off.

368
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:57,475
I wanted to meet you, and I guess...

369
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:02,605
I guess I'm not reaI smooth sometimes.

370
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:05,191
Let me make it up to you.

371
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:08,402
Excuse me, Miss. Is everything all right?

372
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:23,083
So, um... what do you do
for a living, Rosemary?

373
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:26,294
I'm actually volunteering
at the hospitaI right now,

374
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:31,257
cos I'm waiting for this...
re-up thing to come through.

375
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:34,594
Re-up? What, are you in the army?

376
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,099
- Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps. Wow.

377
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:41,767
That's very... altrudocious of you.

378
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:45,687
"Altrudocious"? That's not a word.

379
00:29:45,771 --> 00:29:48,982
Oh! You mean humanidocious, right?

380
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:54,738
- Yeah. That's the one.
- All right. Ready to order?

381
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,907
Yeah. Um...

382
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:05,540
Can I get a double pizza burger, chilli fries
with cheese and a large chocolate milkshake?

383
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,336
Nicely done. I'll have the exact same thing.

384
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,213
You got it.

385
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:17,218
I am impressed.
It's nice to see a girI order a reaI meaI.

386
00:30:17,301 --> 00:30:20,138
I hate it when you guys order
a glass of water and a crouton.

387
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:22,890
It ruins the whole point of goin' out.

388
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,601
That's probably what I should be ordering.

389
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:30,689
But, I don't know, no matter what I eat,
my weight just seems to stay the same.

390
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:33,567
So I figure, what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

391
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,612
Totally. If you can get away with it,
more power to ya.

392
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:43,452
- Don't be a smart ass.
- What are you...? What?

393
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,537
No, I'm just saying, you know.

394
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,499
I feeI bad for people who count calories.
It's no way to live.

395
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:54,170
Yeah. But in return they get to be
a lot thinner than I am.

396
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:01,510
Are you out of your mind?
What do you weigh? 110, 115 pounds?

397
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:06,974
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

398
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,685
OK.

399
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,854
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

400
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:16,316
Trust me, whatever you're doin',
it's working. It is working.

401
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,859
Go on.

402
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,612
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

403
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:23,615
Oops.

404
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,703
- Goddang it.
- Don't move. Is your back all right?

405
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,789
- Yeah.
- Is she all right?

406
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:33,708
Yeah. You gotta get
some decent chairs in here, man.

407
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,294
What's this shit made out of, anyway?

408
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,171
SteeI.

409
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:44,510
Yeah? Well, you should...
get it welded better in the corners!

410
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,679
- All right.
- Rosemary, you sure you're OK?

411
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:53,352
Yeah. I'm a little embarrassed but...
it's happened before, it'll happen again.

412
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:55,521
Oh, man. I...

413
00:31:56,855 --> 00:32:00,608
Don't be embarrassed.
Listen, I beef it. Everybody beefs it.

414
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:04,362
Looks like we're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

415
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,329
- Listen, can you wait here one second?
- HaI, just let it go.

416
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:15,748
Nah. Nah.

417
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:18,126
HaI.

418
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:25,590
You guys are so funny, making fun of me
cos I'm a little pudgy, right?

419
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:30,637
- No, I wasn't making fun of you. I was...
- Do me a favour. Take a look out the window.

420
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:35,600
You see that little fox out there?
You see that little number? She's with me.

421
00:32:35,684 --> 00:32:41,440
If you took all the women you two have ever
gone out with, they wouldn't equaI one of her.

422
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:43,358
- We're not arguing that.
- No.

423
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,362
That's right. Laugh it up, fellas.

424
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:53,200
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, I'm with her.

425
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:55,578
All right? That's it.

426
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:01,459
What happened?

427
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:05,546
Well, let's just say the score's
HaI two, mall rats zero.

428
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:08,132
Let me walk you to your car.

429
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,345
- Well, thanks for lunch, HaI.
- My pleasure, Rosie.

430
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,432
- My mother calls me Rosie.
- Really?

431
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:18,975
Yeah.

432
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,480
Gentlemen, can I interest you
in some chilli fries and half a burger?

433
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:27,442
There's a lot left cos the little guy
couldn't finish his meaI.

434
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,611
- Hey, hey.
- Pussy.

435
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:35,407
- That was nice of you.
- Well, you're all right in my book, too, HaI.

436
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:38,035
- Can I have your number?
- What number?

437
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:40,579
Your PIN number. I want your money

438
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:43,499
Your phone number. What do you think?

439
00:33:43,582 --> 00:33:46,043
Why?

440
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:49,254
You know, to... go out. Maybe, like, tomorrow.

441
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:57,637
Uh...

442
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,890
Well, yeah.

443
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:05,311
I mean, sure. It's in the book
under Rosemary Shanahan.

444
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:08,690
- I can write it down. It's S-h-a...
- No, I'll remember it.

445
00:34:08,773 --> 00:34:12,777
- My boss's name is Steve Shanahan.
- That's my father's name.

446
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,863
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

447
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:17,990
Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:34:18,074 --> 00:34:22,369
Your father is my boss. I mean,
not my boss, but he's my boss's boss.

449
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:26,206
I mean, I don't know him,
but I see him around the office.

450
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,293
Well, then you won't forget my name.

451
00:34:44,807 --> 00:34:46,892
- HaI?
- Yeah?

452
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:54,108
If I don't hear from you...
I appreciate everything anyway.

453
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,447
Cuckoo!

454
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,120
You sure you don't want a dog?

455
00:35:06,203 --> 00:35:09,873
Yeah, yeah. I'm tryin' to lose a couple of LBs.

456
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:13,835
- Since when do you care about your gut?
- I don't really, but...

457
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:17,380
I am a little nervous because of
this girI who's coming to meet me.

458
00:35:17,464 --> 00:35:20,550
- She's incredible.
- Uh-huh?

459
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,635
Like the ones on the dance floor?

460
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,890
Even better, buddy. I'm telling ya,
it's almost beyond belief.

461
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:32,269
She's funny, she's smart,
she teaches self-esteem to sick kids...

462
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:36,398
I would never believe a girI as beautifuI
could have such a great personality.

463
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:38,817
- Ugly-duckling syndrome.
- What?

464
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:44,073
She probably wasn't pretty till high schooI.
The personality developed out of necessity.

465
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:48,327
You know what? I bet you're right.
She's way too pretty to be so nice.

466
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,790
Sometimes they're ugly so long,
when they turn pretty, they don't realise it.

467
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:56,167
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a reaI find.

468
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,753
- Hey!
- Hey!

469
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:00,838
I've been looking for you.

470
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:04,592
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy. The girI with the toe.

471
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,512
- Hey.
- How ya doing?

472
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:11,099
Good. Did you get my message?

473
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:15,436
No, no. My phone machine's
not really working there. Did you call?

474
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:19,606
- I got tickets for that Beatles reunion.
- The Beatles?

475
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:23,694
Yeah. Well, not the reaI Beatles,
but PauI, George and Ringo will be there.

476
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:28,448
But Eric Clapton is filling in for John.
It's an invitation-only acoustic set.

477
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,493
- Only about 70 people, tops.
- Oh, man.

478
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:34,079
- So you're in?
- Uh...

479
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,751
No. Not a Clapton fan.

480
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:44,046
I think I'll pass.

481
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:48,759
OK. Well, I guess I'll see ya.

482
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,846
- Yeah, yeah.
- Bye, Lindy.

483
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,476
- Did you see the toe?
- Mauricio, I gotta tell you, you got issues.

484
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,397
- Don't even get me started.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

485
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,440
There's Rosemary.

486
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:07,527
- Where?
- Right there.

487
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:10,697
- Right where?
- Straight ahead. Across the field.

488
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,617
- Is she behind the rhino?
- She's right there!

489
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:24,169
Mauricio, I want you to meet someone.

490
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:28,380
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

491
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:30,966
Hi. Nice to meet you.

492
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,179
Holy cow. I mean, uh... hi.

493
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:42,061
- Is that a Members Only jacket?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

494
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:45,439
So, what are you, like, the last member?

495
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,233
Oh, man.

496
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,651
One-nothing Rosemary.

497
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,447
Excuse me for just one second. Hello?

498
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,492
Oh, hi, Mom. Yeah, hold on.

499
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,745
- Will you guys excuse me?
- Want something from the snack bar?

500
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:04,207
Yeah, get me a beer
and nachos with all the stuff on it.

501
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,376
You got it.

502
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:12,131
- Does she take the cake or what?
- She takes the whole bakery, HaI.

503
00:38:12,215 --> 00:38:16,677
- I told you.
- Yes, you did. And yet I wasn't prepared.

504
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,307
- So, what are you up for?
- I don't know. I like the track.

505
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:25,227
Ah, so she's a gambler.

506
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,729
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

507
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:32,234
I hate the ponies. There's too much
human involvement, you know?

508
00:38:32,317 --> 00:38:36,070
You can't trust people
If you're looking for a fair deaI.

509
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:41,409
- What about you? Do you gamble?
- No, not really.

510
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,287
I bet on pro football now and then,
But just to make the games more exciting.

511
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,624
- I don't really care if I win.
- Huh.

512
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,836
- I've never read that book.
- What book?

513
00:38:52,586 --> 00:38:55,423
Things Losers Say.

514
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:02,804
Hey, why don't we forget the track, and I'll
introduce you to some good friends of mine?

515
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,514
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

516
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:06,266
- All right.
- What do you say?

517
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,144
- I say OK.
- You say OK?

518
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:16,818
Hi, guys. I want you to meet
a very good friend of mine. OK?

519
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,613
This guy here is HaI. And he's really funny.

520
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,781
Hi.

521
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:24,950
How ya doing? Good to meet ya.

522
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:31,540
Hey. Wow. Oh, my God. Look at that face.

523
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:35,794
She should be doing Keebler commercials.
You're the cutest thing I've ever seen.

524
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:38,922
- What's your name, beautifuI?
- Cadence.

525
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:43,010
Cadence. That's a pretty name.
You know, my uncle's name is Cadence.

526
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,388
Well, I got news for you, Cadence.

527
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,770
I'm not putting you down
untiI the cows come home.

528
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:56,939
Put her down.

529
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,067
The cow came home.

530
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:02,695
What is he doing here?
These aren't visiting hours.

531
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:07,241
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

532
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,951
Fine. Pack it up.

533
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,747
And get these patients back in their beds.

534
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:23,965
- Should we get going?
- Don't pay any attention to Nurse Sourpuss.

535
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,134
Sourpuss.

536
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:31,473
Hey! I got an idea. Do you guys
wanna play the kissing game?

537
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,810
- Yeah?
- You want me to go get a bottle?

538
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,270
This is how we play. Wanna get the lipstick?

539
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:41,315
- Get lipstick.
- Yeah, OK.

540
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:44,694
What we do is, we put on the lipstick...

541
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:50,616
and then the kisser kisses as many times
as they can untiI the lipstick comes off.

542
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,868
CooI! I wanna go first.

543
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:55,870
- Then I'm going last.
- Jesse.

544
00:40:55,912 --> 00:41:02,127
- Hey, they don't have anything I can catch?
- They don't have anything you can catch.

545
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,171
I didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

546
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,133
You're just a bunch of phoneys
like my Uncle Cadence.

547
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,803
I bet you're here just so you can
get out of schooI. Is that right?

548
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:14,764
- Yeah.
- Give me some of that lipstick.

549
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,685
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

550
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,522
I'm serious. A lot of people get
really squeamish in that situation...

551
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:27,276
- Rosemary? Is that you?
- Dr Sayed! How's it going?

552
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,320
- Good. Who's this?
- This is my friend HaI.

553
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,115
- Good to meet you.
- Be nice to her. She's a good girI.

554
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:36,118
- All right.
- Bye, Rosemary.

555
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,162
That's what these kids need -

556
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:42,373
a stranger who isn't afraid to just
be with them and play with them.

557
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:47,795
- That's what builds their self-confidence.
- Why would anybody be afraid of 'em?

558
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:51,174
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

559
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,634
Come on.

560
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:58,973
- This is a nice street you live on.
- Yeah, this is my street.

561
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:03,394
- You wanna come up?
- Yeah. But I don't think I should.

562
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:06,855
Why not? It's only 9 o'clock.

563
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,401
- I know. I just don't think it's a good idea.
- Oh, no. Did I do something?

564
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:14,613
No. You've been really cooI.

565
00:42:16,365 --> 00:42:18,617
- Hi, HaI.
- Oh, hey, Jill.

566
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,245
- Rosemary, this is my neighbour Jill.
- Hi. Nice...

567
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:27,417
- Sorry.
- Nice to meet you.

568
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,585
Nice to meet you too, Jill.

569
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:34,965
I gotta go and meet some friends,
so I'll see you guys later.

570
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,634
- Bye.
- Bye.

571
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,844
Come up.

572
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:41,597
- No.
- What?

573
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:44,892
I thought we were having a good time.

574
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:48,354
We were. It's just, you know,
HaI, I'm not used to all this.

575
00:42:48,437 --> 00:42:51,065
Used to what?

576
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:55,026
HaI, you've been really nice to me today.
I really appreciate it, but...

577
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,988
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

578
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:01,616
- I don't have other boyfriends.
- Bullshit.

579
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,623
Well, I had one boyfriend.

580
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:13,336
It was kind of recently,
actually, but it didn't work out.

581
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,921
- You've been burnt, huh?
- No.

582
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:22,136
That's just it. I, um... I've never been
close enough to anybody to get burnt.

583
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:27,307
Please! With a mug like that?
You must be fighting 'em off daily.

584
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:31,812
Right I mean, I saw the way
your friend Mauricio looked at me.

585
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:35,441
I thought he was gonna shoot me
with a tranquilliser gun and tag my ear.

586
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:42,196
Don't worry. He's been acting really weird
lately, especially around really pretty girls.

587
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,661
HaI... do me a favour and stop saying
that I'm pretty and that I'm not fat, OK?

588
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:51,581
Cos it makes me uncomfortable.

589
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:54,792
OK. You have a problem with compliments?

590
00:43:56,502 --> 00:44:00,214
Look... I know what I am
and I know what I'm not.

591
00:44:01,799 --> 00:44:06,386
I'm the girI who gets really good grades
and is not afraid to be funny.

592
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,974
And I'm the girI who has a lot of friends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

593
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,728
I'm not beautifuI, OK? And I never will be.

594
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,731
And I'm fine with that. You know?

595
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:22,778
But when you go around saying
that I'm something that I'm not,

596
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,821
it's just... it's not nice.

597
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:27,490
Whoa, Rosemary.

598
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:30,910
You're starting to scare me.
I mean, I really like you,

599
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:36,624
but I have to assume you're a little nutty
if you really believe you're not beautifuI.

600
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,626
Grow up, HaI.

601
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:41,212
Rosie. Wait a second.

602
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:53,098
Well, it was too good to be true.

603
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,683
Hm?

604
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,311
Rosemary. Turned out to be a totaI psycho.

605
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:02,774
Her self-image is so far off, it's scary.

606
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:06,987
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

607
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,616
What are you talking about? AII I ever did
was tell her how perfect she was.

608
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,701
Really?

609
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:16,954
Yeah. Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

610
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:22,292
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

611
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:26,213
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

612
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:33,303
You're right. I'm probably more immature
than you, but at least I have a bigger willie.

613
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:43,563
Yeah, bigger than a mouse's.

614
00:45:45,898 --> 00:45:48,526
- What the hell was that?
- I said your willie's...

615
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:52,030
I heard what you said,
but it took you, like, eight seconds.

616
00:45:52,113 --> 00:45:57,827
You can't come back with a comeback after
eight seconds. You got three. Five, tops.

617
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,371
That's why they call it a quip. Not a "slowp".

618
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:07,377
All right, you got anything better to read?
I gotta fire off a missile.

619
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:20,307
Hi.

620
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,684
- Is this a bad time, or...?
- No.

621
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:29,732
I just wanted to apologise for last night.

622
00:46:29,815 --> 00:46:33,235
- You don't have to apologise.
- Yeah, I do.

623
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:38,282
I called you, like, immature or sophomoric
or something like that. I know you're not...

624
00:46:38,366 --> 00:46:42,119
Oh, my God, HaI!
You gotta get in here and look at this turd!

625
00:46:42,203 --> 00:46:44,580
It looks just like Klinger from M*A*S*H.

626
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:51,461
- Why don't we get outta here?
- OK.

627
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:53,630
Coffee?

628
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,308
Excuse me. Are you ready to order?

629
00:47:05,392 --> 00:47:10,229
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers with bacon,
one with relish. Thank you.

630
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:15,192
Ow.

631
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,736
- Are you OK?
- Brain freeze.

632
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,908
* Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go

633
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:25,619
* I'll build my world around you

634
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:29,039
* I need you so, baby, even though...

635
00:47:29,123 --> 00:47:31,749
Excuse me, sweetie. ProfessionaI.

636
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:43,636
Hey, Billy, stay over near the ladder.

637
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,514
Weak. So weak.

638
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:51,602
You wanna see a splash?
I'm gonna show you a splash. Ready?

639
00:47:54,814 --> 00:47:58,483
* Spent a lifetime looking for somebody

640
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:01,361
* To give me love like you

641
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:15,000
* Baby, now that I've found you
I can't let you go...

642
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:18,003
- That was good?
- Bialy?

643
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:21,964
Bialy? Bialy? Billy!

644
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:24,258
Daddy!

645
00:48:27,219 --> 00:48:28,763
Sorry.

646
00:48:44,653 --> 00:48:48,615
- What's the matter?
- I should have changed at the beach.

647
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:51,785
What? Are you crazy? You look great.

648
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:54,704
I don't normally dress like this
around my parents.

649
00:48:54,788 --> 00:48:59,167
Hey, hey, come on. I'm the one
who should be nervous here, not you.

650
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:07,299
Hey, you know, I've been meaning to ask you.
Were you adopted?

651
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:09,593
No. Why?

652
00:49:09,677 --> 00:49:12,137
Cos your dad has that weird accent.

653
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:17,309
And I've seen him around the office. I gotta
say, I don't see the slightest resemblance.

654
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:21,897
Really? Everybody says If you put
a wig on him, he'd look just like me.

655
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:27,027
Look at who's here now.
Come here, my darlin'.

656
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:28,903
Hi, Daddy.

657
00:49:28,987 --> 00:49:31,739
- Rosie, honey.
- Mom.

658
00:49:31,823 --> 00:49:33,866
Good to see ya.

659
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,619
This is HaI Larson,
the guy I was telling you about.

660
00:49:36,703 --> 00:49:39,205
- Great to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

661
00:49:40,164 --> 00:49:44,585
- Nice to meet you, HaI.
- The pleasure is mine, Mrs Shanahan.

662
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:48,423
Wow. I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

663
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:58,682
What the hell... What the hell
is that you've got on?

664
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:02,728
We were at the beach.

665
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:06,857
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

666
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,737
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to
do that for me. Let's just keep it casuaI.

667
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,363
CasuaI.

668
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:19,535
Hey, Dad, HaI's one of your great
untapped resources down at the company.

669
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:25,124
- Why don't you tell him some of your ideas?
- Oh, so you've got a few ideas, do ya?

670
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,669
It is risky, but the rewards are greater, too.

671
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:33,841
Only a company with a solid reputation
like JPS could ever market this product.

672
00:50:37,261 --> 00:50:40,722
- HaI, let me take your plate.
- Thank you. It was delicious.

673
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:45,226
- Can I get you boys some coffee?
- I'd love a cup of tea, darlin'.

674
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,438
Maybe just a drop of the hard stuff.

675
00:50:48,521 --> 00:50:52,484
Yeah, I'll just have a cup of joe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

676
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:58,156
I have to say, HaI,
I'm impressed with a lot of your ideas.

677
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:03,452
Some of them are dog shit, but for the most
part you seem to have done your homework.

678
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:05,996
- So I'd like you to do something for me.
- OK.

679
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,292
I'm meeting with me executive committee
Monday morning,

680
00:51:10,376 --> 00:51:13,879
and I'd like you to make a presentation.

681
00:51:13,963 --> 00:51:17,508
- Seriously?
- Well, nothing fancy, you understand.

682
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:21,303
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

683
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:23,180
Great. I'd love to.

684
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:28,017
Oh, and by the way,
you can cut out the act now.

685
00:51:28,768 --> 00:51:29,811
Excuse me?

686
00:51:29,894 --> 00:51:34,357
You think I got as far as I did
in me life by bein' a fooI?

687
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,443
Now, you've got ambition,
HaI, and I admire that.

688
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,613
Hell, I wish I had a hundred
more like yourself.

689
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,116
We'd be the number one firm in the country.

690
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,203
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

691
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:50,372
I'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

692
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:53,458
I told you to cut the shit out, all right?

693
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:58,505
Look, Rosemary's me daughter,
and God knows I love her dearly.

694
00:51:59,756 --> 00:52:04,428
But I think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

695
00:52:04,511 --> 00:52:08,181
marching along with the Dallas cheerleaders.

696
00:52:13,102 --> 00:52:15,104
Uh...

697
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:17,148
I don't understand.

698
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:21,277
I'm telling the truth, HaI.

699
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,782
And the truth is I haven't been able to bounce
me daughter on me knee since she was two.

700
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:32,538
You know, I've read about people like you.

701
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,542
- People like me?
- Super achievers with impossible standards.

702
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:40,712
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing ever measures up.

703
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:45,383
It never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

704
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,678
You think they're an extension of you,
like your company,

705
00:52:48,762 --> 00:52:53,016
or your $20-million Learjet
and your Picasso out in the front hall.

706
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,520
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

707
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,648
Go on.

708
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:05,819
When I first met Rosemary, she told me
she knew she wasn't that good-looking.

709
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:10,449
I could not believe my ears.
I thought how can a person this beautifuI

710
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:15,663
possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror
to be anything other than that?

711
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:17,873
Well, now I know.

712
00:53:23,962 --> 00:53:26,714
Is everything OK?

713
00:53:26,798 --> 00:53:30,093
Yeah, everything is fine. Just fine.

714
00:53:38,893 --> 00:53:40,979
What?

715
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,107
Nothin'.

716
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,692
I just can't believe how lucky I am.

717
00:53:53,949 --> 00:53:56,743
You swear to God you're not gonna laugh?

718
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:59,579
Come on, I'm not gonna laugh.

719
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,796
Oh.

720
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:10,631
Daddy like.

721
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:15,303
* The look on your face

722
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:21,684
* It could never explain your heart

723
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:27,440
* And the touch of my lips

724
00:54:28,024 --> 00:54:33,361
* It could never tell you my thoughts

725
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:37,741
* And you want me to change

726
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:41,703
* I can't get used to...

727
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:45,874
What in the...? How did...?

728
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,007
Get over here, Houdini.

729
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,342
* Cos it's not really me

730
00:54:56,425 --> 00:55:01,639
* This is my world, this is who I am

731
00:55:32,919 --> 00:55:35,546
- I'm gonna call you later.
- OK.

732
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,091
Bye.

733
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:54,022
Forget something?

734
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:55,691
Oh, hey.

735
00:55:55,774 --> 00:55:58,443
Hi. I'm glad I caught you
before you went to work.

736
00:55:58,527 --> 00:55:59,736
What's up?

737
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,614
I was wondering if you wanted
to come over tonight,

738
00:56:02,698 --> 00:56:06,701
open a bottle of wine, maybe watch a video?

739
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:08,369
Nah. Thanks, though.

740
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:19,755
And in summation, I feeI that these measures
will help JPS and all of our customers.

741
00:56:26,846 --> 00:56:29,848
- Nice job, HaI.
- Thank you.

742
00:56:29,931 --> 00:56:31,433
- Nicely done.
- I appreciate it.

743
00:56:31,516 --> 00:56:34,811
- HaI, I stand corrected.
- Thank you.

744
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:38,523
HaI, I need to see you
in me office straight away.

745
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:40,525
Sure.

746
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,944
Sit yourself down.

747
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:48,283
So... what'd you think?

748
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,660
I'll be gettin' to that in a minute.

749
00:56:51,702 --> 00:56:55,289
I want to talk to you about
that conversation we had the other night,

750
00:56:55,372 --> 00:56:58,250
and all of them things you said to me.

751
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:04,465
Well, I'm more than just a little embarrassed,
having said what I said.

752
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:07,217
I think me daughter is lucky to have you.

753
00:57:07,885 --> 00:57:11,055
No, sir. I'm the lucky one.

754
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,390
Indeed.

755
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:19,395
Well, now, as to your meeting in there,
sure, it was first-rate.

756
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,898
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes.

757
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,026
HaI, I'm gonna leveI with you.

758
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:28,112
- I need your balls.
- Sir?

759
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:31,908
I need a man around that can
give it to me straight, you know?

760
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,494
Whether the news be good or bad.

761
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:41,541
So I've decided - from now on,
you'll be working directly for me.

762
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,586
Uh...

763
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:49,383
I don't know what to say
but, um... thank you.

764
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,886
Well, a thank you will do just fine.

765
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,810
Well... get the fuck out.

766
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,019
OK.

767
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,319
Congratulations on your promot...

768
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,989
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no. Come in, come in.

769
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:19,412
I want you to meet Rosemary. Rosemary, this
is Jen and Artie. Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

770
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,414
As in Steve?

771
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:25,959
Yeah, he's my dad. Oh, God, which
reminds me, I gotta meet him for lunch.

772
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:28,128
So I'll see you this weekend, OK?

773
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:37,304
It was really nice to meet you guys.
Do you mind if I take a little sliver?

774
00:58:43,393 --> 00:58:45,603
Beauty.

775
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:47,771
Do you want a plate?

776
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:53,360
I know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

777
00:58:53,444 --> 00:58:57,239
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

778
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,784
The least we could do,
seeing as how you worked so hard

779
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:03,954
to become "indispensable" to the company.

780
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:08,208
Is that that new thing called sarcasm?

781
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:13,880
HaI, we all know you're about as deep as a
puddle. That used to be part of your charm.

782
00:59:13,963 --> 00:59:18,426
- But this just flat-out sucks.
- What are you talking about?

783
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:23,556
If you have one ounce of integrity left,
you'll break it off immediately,

784
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,351
before you hurt the poor girI.

785
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:39,279
I gotta give you credit for being more
proactive and starting to meet women.

786
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:41,573
Who knows? Maybe you are on a roll here,

787
00:59:41,657 --> 00:59:45,452
but don't you think it's time
to raise the bar a little?

788
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,830
I mean, at first I thought
you were in a slump, you know?

789
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:52,542
I could, as a friend, look the other way
while you banged a few fatties

790
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:56,171
and got it out of your system,
but there's lots of good fish out there.

791
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:58,589
You don't have to snack on carp any more.

792
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:03,344
I suppose the girls we partied with a couple
weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp?

793
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:07,348
No. Laura, the one with the whiskers,
she looked more like a catfish.

794
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:10,518
Oh, I see. And what about Marie?

795
01:00:10,601 --> 01:00:14,230
Pop some bolts on her neck
and the villagers'll be chasing her.

796
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:16,107
- And Vicki?
- Who?

797
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,733
- Vicki!
- Who's Vicki?

798
01:00:17,817 --> 01:00:20,777
Vicki Vicki. With the short brown hair.

799
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,155
Vicki? I thought that was a guy.
I was calling her Vic!

800
01:00:24,197 --> 01:00:25,115
Oh!

801
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:29,160
- You're out of your mind!
- I know I'm being a little harsh on you here.

802
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:32,998
I think reaI friends are obligated
to be honest with each other.

803
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:36,418
And this one that you're dating now -jeez.

804
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:38,670
CarefuI.

805
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:42,841
Hey, all I'm saying is
she's got cankles, for God's sake.

806
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:45,342
- What?
- Cankles! She's got no ankles.

807
01:00:45,426 --> 01:00:49,305
It's like the calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

808
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:52,599
I know what cankles are.
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

809
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:55,811
You know what?
I know what you're doing here.

810
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:59,440
- You're scared.
- Scared?

811
01:00:59,773 --> 01:01:04,069
Yup. This is exactly what you did
with the knockout with the weird toe.

812
01:01:04,153 --> 01:01:08,364
You're just inventing reasons
to dump girls cos you're afraid.

813
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:11,367
All right, look,
I admit Rosemary is kind of cooI.

814
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:14,495
But you wouldn't even be talking
to that woolly mammoth

815
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,124
if her father wasn't
the president of your company.

816
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:24,422
What?

817
01:01:31,928 --> 01:01:35,891
I guarantee you've never met anyone
like this guy. You're gonna love him.

818
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:39,770
- Great. What's his girlfriend like?
- I don't know. I haven't met her.

819
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:42,731
They just started going out. Oh, there he is.

820
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:44,983
Walt!

821
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:47,527
At your cervix!

822
01:01:47,611 --> 01:01:50,113
Hey, you recognise these panties?

823
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:53,033
Rosemary, don't steaI my lines.

824
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:55,952
- You two know each other?
- Yeah!

825
01:01:56,035 --> 01:01:59,622
Gosh, Walt's been volunteering
down at the hospitaI for years.

826
01:01:59,705 --> 01:02:00,831
Oh.

827
01:02:00,915 --> 01:02:03,167
So where's this mystery girI?

828
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:06,420
She should be here any minute.

829
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:11,050
Hey, uh...

830
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:15,763
I want you to be honest.
Is this outfit too "Hey, look at me"?

831
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:19,766
No, no. It's... it's very subtle.

832
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:31,319
- Sorry I'm late.
- Tanya.

833
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:35,448
Oh. What a surprise.

834
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:44,373
* I've spent all summer days drivin'

835
01:02:45,082 --> 01:02:48,544
* I'm tired of holidays ruined

836
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:53,882
* No more takeaways, expired food...

837
01:02:53,966 --> 01:02:57,219
- I gotta get a map.
- I'm going with you.

838
01:02:57,303 --> 01:02:59,096
What are those for?

839
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:04,183
You ever walked through a truck-stop
men's room on your hands?

840
01:03:07,312 --> 01:03:10,023
- Want anything?
- Potato chips. And dip.

841
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:15,528
Cut it out.

842
01:03:16,738 --> 01:03:21,492
So, Tanya, I had no idea that you and Walt
were, you know, seeing each other.

843
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:23,661
Yeah. You got a light?

844
01:03:33,211 --> 01:03:38,383
It's actually a very funny story. Because he
had been asking me out for a really long time

845
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:41,053
and I was always kind of unavailable.

846
01:03:41,136 --> 01:03:46,141
And then just when he had given up, I broke
up with my boyfriend, and there he was.

847
01:03:46,224 --> 01:03:48,518
So I asked him out.

848
01:03:48,602 --> 01:03:51,187
So he kind of grew on you, huh?

849
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:55,066
Exactly. I mean, you gotta admit,

850
01:03:55,149 --> 01:03:58,194
when you first meet him, it is kind of jarring.

851
01:03:58,277 --> 01:04:01,948
I mean, you kinda don't even know
what goes where.

852
01:04:02,031 --> 01:04:05,368
But, anyway, the timing
couldn't have been more perfect,

853
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:10,498
because he had just sold his company,
and he has all this time on his hands,

854
01:04:10,581 --> 01:04:13,209
and we can plan things

855
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:16,169
and traveI and go shopping and...

856
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:21,049
Well, I guess timing's everything.

857
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:27,931
Hope you like bean dip.

858
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,561
* I'd already picked up all the faces

859
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:37,481
* And I, I wanna show you all the places

860
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:41,443
* And I, I wanna take a little ride

861
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:46,532
* Wanna take a little ride,
countryside with you

862
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:08,094
Yeah! That was my girI.

863
01:05:08,177 --> 01:05:10,680
Oh, my God. I'm the biggest nerd.

864
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:14,350
- Rosemary!
- Ralph!

865
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:17,478
Hi.

866
01:05:17,604 --> 01:05:20,106
You remember Li'iBoy?

867
01:05:20,189 --> 01:05:22,567
Li'iBoy. Yeah. How are you?

868
01:05:23,317 --> 01:05:25,277
- Mahalo, Rosemary.
- How you doing?

869
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,779
- Great.
- Wow.

870
01:05:27,904 --> 01:05:32,534
- They still got you out in Sierra Leone?
- No, no. Now they got me nearer my home.

871
01:05:32,618 --> 01:05:35,621
I'm on this island
in the South Pacific called Kiribati.

872
01:05:35,704 --> 01:05:38,832
- I'm HaI.
- Oh, I'm sorry. HaI.

873
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:45,088
These are my Peace Corps buddies. This is
Ralph Owens and Li'iBoy. This is HaI Larson.

874
01:05:45,172 --> 01:05:46,756
- What's up?
- Li'iBoy.

875
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:52,637
So, what are you guys doing up here?

876
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,598
Li'iBoy's been stuck in the office
training for 30 days,

877
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:58,142
so I dragged him here
and threw him on the slopes.

878
01:05:58,267 --> 01:06:00,478
It wasn't pretty.

879
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:04,982
I knew this Hawaiian guy in high schooI
who went out for the hockey team.

880
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:07,526
It was funny as shit.

881
01:06:11,947 --> 01:06:15,867
Anyway... it's great to see you again.

882
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:20,372
You look... happy.

883
01:06:21,164 --> 01:06:23,875
Thanks. I am.

884
01:06:27,337 --> 01:06:30,048
Well, we got a long drive back, so...

885
01:06:31,508 --> 01:06:33,217
- Bye.
- Bye.

886
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,386
Good to meet ya.

887
01:06:39,556 --> 01:06:42,059
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

888
01:06:43,644 --> 01:06:48,607
It's just that... Do you remember
how I told you that once I had a boyfriend?

889
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:50,985
That was him.

890
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,452
You're welcome.

891
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:03,621
What's your name?

892
01:07:04,956 --> 01:07:07,959
Excuse me, Mr Robbins.
Could I have a word with you, sir?

893
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:11,087
- Sure, but I gotta catch a plane.
- It'll only take a minute.

894
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:14,882
A few weeks ago, you got trapped
in an elevator with a friend of mine.

895
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:19,512
HaI! He was a great guy. He was having
trouble with his relationships. How is he?

896
01:07:19,596 --> 01:07:23,432
- Well, that's a matter of debate.
- Really?

897
01:07:23,515 --> 01:07:26,685
Anyway, apparently,
you gave him, like, a... pep talk,

898
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:31,231
and now he's under the impression
that he can get any woman he wants.

899
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:34,735
- And you don't think he can?
- I don't know. Whatever.

900
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:40,824
But, see, the point is,
lately the only women he wants... are ugly.

901
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:44,577
- Who says they're ugly?
- Bausch & Lomb.

902
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,457
And very fat, some of them.
It's like HaI has lowered his whole...

903
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,209
Jesus, you've got a big noggin.

904
01:07:52,293 --> 01:07:55,504
Thanks for noticing.
My new book has a chapter on blurting.

905
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:58,716
- You might wanna pick it up.
- Yeah, I'll check into that.

906
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,719
Anyway, I mean,
did something go wrong here?

907
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:04,221
Or is my friend having a nervous breakdown?

908
01:08:04,305 --> 01:08:08,266
No. Haven't you ever heard the phrase
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?

909
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,354
Yeah. Did you ever hear the song
"Who Let The Dogs Out"?

910
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:17,067
- It can't be that bad.
- Look, exactly what did you do to him, man?

911
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,486
I altered his perception a little bit.

912
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:23,615
I knew it. I knew it! I knew it!

913
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:27,202
- You messed with his eyesight, right?
- No.

914
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:30,120
- You hypnotised him.
- No. I dehypnotised him.

915
01:08:30,204 --> 01:08:33,666
He's been hypnotised his whole life,
totally focused on the outside.

916
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:36,293
I helped him to see
the inner beauty in everyone,

917
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:39,338
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

918
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:43,676
How can he see their inner beauty
when he doesn't even know them?

919
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,804
Inner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

920
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:50,474
But how can he not... feeI them when he's...?

921
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:55,812
The brain sees what the heart wants it to feeI.

922
01:08:55,895 --> 01:08:59,399
All right, look. Let's just
cut through the old crapcake here!

923
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:01,567
OK.

924
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:09,701
Sir, don't... don't you think
it's wrong to brainwash someone?

925
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:11,911
Don't you think you're brainwashed?

926
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:15,915
Everything you know about beauty
is programmed. TV, magazines, movies.

927
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:20,502
They're all telling you what's beautifuI
and what isn't. How's this any different?

928
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:24,339
Look, I didn't come here to debate you!
I just want my friend back!

929
01:09:24,423 --> 01:09:30,304
Now, isn't there some kind of word or phrase
or something to take the whammy off him?!

930
01:09:30,387 --> 01:09:35,183
Of course. But if we do that, he'll go back
to judging everybody by the outside.

931
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:39,062
- Is this what he really wants?
- I don't care what he wants!

932
01:09:39,146 --> 01:09:41,939
It's what I want! I want my friend back!

933
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:45,192
I gotta go. I gotta catch my plane.
I'm really sorry.

934
01:09:45,276 --> 01:09:49,947
Look, a man's reputation, dignity
and furniture are being trashed here!

935
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:55,161
Perhaps irreparably!
For God's sakes, his job is in jeopardy!

936
01:09:55,244 --> 01:09:58,581
- His job? Really?
- Yes. And it's a great job.

937
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:05,545
I just wanted to give him a gift.
I didn't want him to get hurt.

938
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:08,340
You seem to know him
better than I do, so, um...

939
01:10:08,423 --> 01:10:12,469
- It's a shame to let it go.
- Oh, it's a tragedy.

940
01:10:13,762 --> 01:10:16,890
So, what did you wanna talk to me about?

941
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:25,649
- Ralph called me.
- Your old boyfriend Ralph?

942
01:10:25,732 --> 01:10:29,276
Well, he was also my division leader
in Sierra Leone.

943
01:10:30,444 --> 01:10:35,908
Anyway, he's shipping out to Kiribati in ten
days and he wants me to go with his group.

944
01:10:35,991 --> 01:10:39,453
What? You and Ralph? Kiribati?

945
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:42,164
They're in the middle
of this economic meltdown.

946
01:10:42,248 --> 01:10:47,461
100,000 women and children need medicaI
supplies and food, and they want me to help.

947
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:50,171
How can you be so selfish?

948
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:51,464
Sorry?

949
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:55,426
I mean, you know what I'm sayin'.
You bump into pretty-boy Ralph on Friday,

950
01:10:55,510 --> 01:11:00,390
the sparks are flying, and now you're
gonna go and save the world in Kiribati?

951
01:11:00,473 --> 01:11:04,102
- This has nothing to do with me and Ralph.
- Yeah, right.

952
01:11:04,185 --> 01:11:06,562
He's obviously crazy about you.

953
01:11:06,646 --> 01:11:08,898
He's got the heart of a saint.

954
01:11:08,982 --> 01:11:13,402
I could practically see the halo
around his head. I can't compete with that.

955
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:17,114
OK, first of all, you're probably
the only person in the Free World

956
01:11:17,197 --> 01:11:19,449
to ever refer to Ralph as a "pretty-boy".

957
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:23,287
Secondly, that halo around his head,
it's called psoriasis.

958
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,540
You can't stand within three feet
without getting flaked on.

959
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:30,377
And thirdly, and fourthly, yes,
he's a great guy and he cares about me,

960
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,422
but he had no sense of humour.

961
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:36,424
And I'm in love with an even greater guy.

962
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,345
Well, then how come I don't have
any say in this thing?

963
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:43,472
You do. That's why...

964
01:11:46,642 --> 01:11:48,686
God, are you OK?

965
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:54,817
- Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
- You should be sorry! This is an outrage!

966
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,695
- I'll go get help.
- Are you OK, sweetie?

967
01:11:57,778 --> 01:11:59,030
Thank you very much.

968
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:01,156
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

969
01:12:01,281 --> 01:12:05,952
It's this flimsy-ass four-star restaurant.

970
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:09,205
Just sit right here.
I'm gonna go talk to the manager, OK?

971
01:12:09,289 --> 01:12:11,374
I'll be right back.

972
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,545
Good night. Thank you.

973
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:22,218
I'm not blaming you, but I need a chair. My
girlfriend's jinxed when it comes to furniture.

974
01:12:22,302 --> 01:12:24,887
I'm so sorry.
The waiter told me what happened.

975
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:27,598
Just a sec. Mclntosh's.

976
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:32,186
Hello?

977
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:35,230
- Shallow Hal wants a gal.
- What?

978
01:12:35,314 --> 01:12:37,900
Shallow HaI wants a gaI.

979
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:42,363
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I just saved your life, baby.

980
01:12:42,446 --> 01:12:44,949
- What?
- I've been looking for you all day.

981
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:48,076
I'm at Mclntosh's with Rosemary.
Look, I got kind of a...

982
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,537
- Are you looking right at her?
- No, I'm talking to the hostess.

983
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:53,248
HaI, don't! HaI...

984
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:56,960
- Look, I got a situation here. I'll call you later.
- Look away!

985
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:04,008
- I was just talking to the hostess.
- Right. That would be me.

986
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,469
No, no. It was the other hostess.

987
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:09,513
Sir, I'm the only hostess in the restaurant.

988
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:14,059
Let me apologise about the booth.
We are so sorry.

989
01:13:14,142 --> 01:13:19,773
We've replaced your date's side with a new
chair, a strong one, and the meaI's on us.

990
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:23,277
Oh, OK. Well... thank you.

991
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,988
You're welcome.

992
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:43,087
Excuse me. Did you... did you move us?

993
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:45,965
No. Second table on the right.

994
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:51,679
Well, then maybe you can explain to me
why that robust woman

995
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:53,681
is eating my girlfriend's din...

996
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:56,600
Hey! Now she's eating my clams casino!

997
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,062
Sweetie, are you OK?

998
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:03,398
Excuse me.

999
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,525
Mclntosh's. Tiffany.

1000
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:08,069
Mm-hm. OK.

1001
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,261
We're two friends walking. We're just walking.

1002
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:37,056
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what I thought.

1003
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,684
- Which is?
- You weren't irresistible to women.

1004
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:44,270
He hypnotised you so that
really ugly girls that you met from then on

1005
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:47,065
- would, to you, look like supermodels.
- What?

1006
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:51,653
If they had inner beauty or some baloney.
You could get any woman you desired

1007
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:55,198
because you were suddenly
desiring the undesirable.

1008
01:14:55,281 --> 01:14:58,493
- You get it?
- No, not exactly.

1009
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:04,123
Let me put it this way. It's like
he gave you beer-goggle laser surgery.

1010
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:06,833
Now wait a second. So what you're saying

1011
01:15:06,959 --> 01:15:11,380
is that all the pretty girls I've met lately
are not really pretty?

1012
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,091
All right. Let's look at the facts.

1013
01:15:14,258 --> 01:15:17,469
They were funny, smart and nice.

1014
01:15:18,637 --> 01:15:23,433
Pretty girls are not funny!
And they're certainly not nice. Not to us.

1015
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:27,604
When I found out what Robbins was doing,
I convinced him to take the trance away.

1016
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:33,568
When I said "Shallow HaI wants a gaI",
you were cured.

1017
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:37,446
You're out of your mind. Do you know that?
I'm going back to the restaurant.

1018
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:40,658
- HaI. HaI, come on.
- Hey, HaI!

1019
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:46,038
You never called me back.
What happened to you?

1020
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:49,584
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

1021
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,877
I've got my hair back.

1022
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:54,087
It's me - Katrina.

1023
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:57,799
We shared the cab together.

1024
01:15:59,175 --> 01:16:04,014
I'm in town taking care of my grandma,
cos she's been sick, and...

1025
01:16:05,348 --> 01:16:08,268
Oh, wait a minute! I get it!

1026
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:12,439
Nice try, Mauricio.
Where'd you find this one?

1027
01:16:15,317 --> 01:16:18,319
No, it's me - Katrina.

1028
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:22,197
From Boston. The... the magicaI fruit?

1029
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:25,993
Yes, I remember Katrina.
But the thing is, you're not Ka...

1030
01:16:30,205 --> 01:16:32,750
I never told you about K...

1031
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:38,088
Katrina! How the heck are ya?
Give me some sugar.

1032
01:16:39,797 --> 01:16:42,926
I didn't recognise you. The hair and the...

1033
01:16:45,053 --> 01:16:50,475
You screwed me, man! I had a beautifuI,
caring, funny, intelligent woman,

1034
01:16:50,516 --> 01:16:52,977
and you made her disappear!

1035
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:59,734
Oh, no, I didn't. I just made Rosemary appear.
There's a difference. It's called reality.

1036
01:16:59,817 --> 01:17:05,989
Hey, if you can see something and hear it
and smell it, what keeps it from being reaI?

1037
01:17:06,073 --> 01:17:08,325
Third-party perspective.

1038
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:10,911
Other people agreeing that it's reaI.

1039
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:16,541
OK, let me ask you a question.
Who's the all-time love of your life?

1040
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:19,795
Wonder Woman.

1041
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:23,548
OK. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

1042
01:17:23,632 --> 01:17:27,385
Would it bother you if the rest of the world
didn't find her attractive?

1043
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:29,845
Not at all. Cos I know they'd be wrong.

1044
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:33,474
That's what I had with Rosemary!

1045
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:37,395
I saw a knockout!
I don't care what anybody else saw!

1046
01:17:37,436 --> 01:17:40,690
Jeez, I never thought about it that way.

1047
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:49,406
- Hey, I guess I really did screw you, huh?
- What am I gonna do?

1048
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:53,577
Hey, hey, don't panic.
We just get Tony Robbins back here,

1049
01:17:53,618 --> 01:17:56,788
he puts the Vulcan mind-meld on ya
and he puts you back under.

1050
01:17:56,913 --> 01:17:57,747
Good idea.

1051
01:17:57,872 --> 01:18:00,959
- In the meantime you just avoid Rosemary.
- Why?

1052
01:18:01,084 --> 01:18:05,964
Because if you see the reaI Rosemary,
hypnosis is not gonna help you.

1053
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:09,050
You'll need the jaws of life
to get that image out of your head.

1054
01:18:17,057 --> 01:18:19,059
HaI, open up. It's me.

1055
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:26,859
I hear you in there.

1056
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:30,613
Just a sec, Rosemary.

1057
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:40,163
What happened to you
at the restaurant?

1058
01:18:40,246 --> 01:18:43,625
I got something in my eye.
I had to run back here and flush it out.

1059
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:47,253
Yeah, the hostess said
that you seemed a little cuckoo.

1060
01:18:47,337 --> 01:18:50,215
- So, come on, open up.
- I can't.

1061
01:18:50,298 --> 01:18:51,132
Uh...

1062
01:18:51,216 --> 01:18:53,051
- Let her in. We'll club her.
- No.

1063
01:18:53,218 --> 01:18:55,136
I'm, uh... I'm...

1064
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,388
I'm very sick.

1065
01:18:57,472 --> 01:18:59,848
I've got, uh... um...

1066
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:02,643
- CC!
- You have what?

1067
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:06,563
Contagious conjunctivitis.

1068
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:10,776
I'll take my chances. Now open up.

1069
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:14,780
All right. In a minute.

1070
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:30,253
I told you it was nasty.

1071
01:19:30,336 --> 01:19:34,131
Are you OK? Do you need
to go to the hospitaI?

1072
01:19:34,215 --> 01:19:37,343
Nah, nah. I got some drops. I'll be fine.

1073
01:19:39,804 --> 01:19:42,390
- My poor baby.
- Yeah.

1074
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:46,059
Well, I should probably rack out.
This has taken a lot out of me.

1075
01:19:46,142 --> 01:19:48,228
OK.

1076
01:19:49,646 --> 01:19:52,732
Well, I'll call you in the morning
and see how you're doing.

1077
01:19:52,816 --> 01:19:55,527
Great, great. Bye-bye.

1078
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:03,368
* Pop the cork, a champagne glass

1079
01:20:03,451 --> 01:20:06,329
* Raise to the future, drink to the past

1080
01:20:06,413 --> 01:20:08,914
* Thank the Lord for the friends he cast

1081
01:20:08,998 --> 01:20:11,792
* in the play he wrote for you

1082
01:20:11,876 --> 01:20:15,087
* And if you love the girl, man, light up a torch

1083
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:18,090
* Blaze a trail to her front porch

1084
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:20,509
* Kiss her till your lips are scorched

1085
01:20:20,593 --> 01:20:22,887
* Till the rain comes down on you

1086
01:20:24,013 --> 01:20:26,724
* Bless your sweet mistakes...

1087
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:31,645
HaI, is everything all right with you?

1088
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:35,523
Yeah. Yeah, it's topnotch, sir.

1089
01:20:36,316 --> 01:20:38,234
Why?

1090
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:41,404
Well, it's just that Rosemary's been telling me

1091
01:20:41,446 --> 01:20:47,035
that she's having a bit of trouble getting you
on the telephone the last couple of days.

1092
01:20:47,118 --> 01:20:50,663
Now, I wouldn't be working you
too hard, would I?

1093
01:20:51,497 --> 01:20:54,500
No. I mean, I'm working hard,

1094
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:58,128
but I guess I've just been
a little preoccupied with things.

1095
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:02,591
But I'll make sure and touch base with her.

1096
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:06,261
Right. Right.

1097
01:21:07,387 --> 01:21:09,431
OK, then.

1098
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:19,941
I'm sorry. Apparently Tony Robbins is a lot
tougher to track down than I thought he'd be.

1099
01:21:20,024 --> 01:21:23,236
- I'll come through. I promise.
- I can't keep this up, man.

1100
01:21:23,402 --> 01:21:26,155
Calm down.

1101
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:30,284
I don't know, Mauricio.
Maybe I should just see her.

1102
01:21:31,452 --> 01:21:33,955
I mean, I do have...

1103
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:38,251
you know, the heart thing.

1104
01:21:38,334 --> 01:21:41,795
Maybe that's enough
to overcome her appearance.

1105
01:21:41,878 --> 01:21:44,464
It could be like in that movie -
The Crying Game.

1106
01:21:44,548 --> 01:21:47,050
When the guy fell in love
with a beautifuI woman?

1107
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:51,680
And then when he found out it was a guy,
it didn't matter, cos he already loved her.

1108
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:57,143
HaI, if a set of hairy boys was
your biggest hurdle here, I'd say go for it.

1109
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:11,323
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1110
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:13,701
Hey, what's up, Rosemary?

1111
01:22:13,784 --> 01:22:16,745
- What happened yesterday?
- Hm?

1112
01:22:16,829 --> 01:22:20,749
Well, I stopped by your office to say hi,
but you just took off running.

1113
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,627
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No.

1114
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:27,506
- What were you doing?
- I was jogging.

1115
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:32,635
- In your business suit?
- I had a sweat suit underneath.

1116
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:34,762
Oh.

1117
01:22:36,389 --> 01:22:39,017
Is everything...?

1118
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,895
What's going on, HaI?

1119
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:44,397
Things haven't felt the same lately.

1120
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,983
- No?
- No.

1121
01:22:48,651 --> 01:22:51,612
Hey, Rosemary, don't worry. Everything...

1122
01:22:52,905 --> 01:22:56,867
I'm just in a little funk right now,
and everything's gonna be fine.

1123
01:22:59,703 --> 01:23:02,414
Yeah. So, uh...

1124
01:23:02,497 --> 01:23:05,000
I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow?

1125
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:06,627
Bye.

1126
01:23:08,337 --> 01:23:10,464
Bye.

1127
01:23:10,547 --> 01:23:14,551
* What happened to you?

1128
01:23:16,928 --> 01:23:20,806
* I can’t get to you

1129
01:23:22,099 --> 01:23:25,144
* Cos there's a wall in your heart

1130
01:23:25,186 --> 01:23:28,356
* That no one can get through

1131
01:23:28,522 --> 01:23:31,651
* And it’s cold and it's dark

1132
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:34,779
* And you don’t have a clue

1133
01:23:34,862 --> 01:23:38,031
* But this wall, it will fall

1134
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:40,242
* If it’s the last thing I do

1135
01:23:41,034 --> 01:23:43,537
* I'll get through

1136
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:48,708
* This wall in your heart

1137
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:53,171
- Who is it?
- HaI, is that you? It's Jill.

1138
01:23:53,255 --> 01:23:55,340
Comin'.

1139
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:58,093
Hey, what's up?

1140
01:23:58,176 --> 01:24:01,554
Hey. My girlfriend just bailed on me,

1141
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:05,474
and I was wondering if I could
take you out to dinner.

1142
01:24:05,558 --> 01:24:07,893
I'm sorry. Tonight's not good.

1143
01:24:08,018 --> 01:24:11,981
Don't be such a stiff.
There's some stuff I wanna talk to you about.

1144
01:24:12,064 --> 01:24:16,026
- No, really, I can't.
- Please? We'll go out just as friends.

1145
01:24:17,236 --> 01:24:19,905
Oh, come on. You gotta eat, don't you?

1146
01:24:21,532 --> 01:24:25,451
- Can I ask you something, Jill?
- Yeah.

1147
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,788
Why the sudden thaw?

1148
01:24:29,414 --> 01:24:32,917
Well, I've... I've been thinking a lot.

1149
01:24:34,752 --> 01:24:40,758
HaI, I... I made a mistake. I never
should have broken it off with you.

1150
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:44,596
Well, you didn't really break it off.
We only had that one date.

1151
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:49,308
Besides, you did the right thing. We didn't
have anything in common, remember?

1152
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,936
But that was my fault.
I shut you out emotionally.

1153
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,481
We could have had more things
in common if I'd wanted to.

1154
01:24:57,274 --> 01:25:00,068
- Mr Shanahan, how are you this evening?
- How am I?

1155
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:03,989
Tonight I feeI like a thorn
amongst a bed of roses.

1156
01:25:04,072 --> 01:25:07,993
- Your table's ready. John'll seat you.
- Right this way, please.

1157
01:25:08,076 --> 01:25:12,580
- I'm just gonna go to the ladies' room.
- OK, Rosie. We'll be at the table.

1158
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:38,438
Yeah. See, why did you shut me out
in the first place? I'm just curious.

1159
01:25:38,521 --> 01:25:43,401
Well, frankly,
I guess I... thought you were shallow.

1160
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:46,530
Me?

1161
01:25:46,613 --> 01:25:52,577
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficiaI... dickwad.

1162
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:55,747
I don't know. What do you call it?

1163
01:25:56,414 --> 01:25:58,332
HaI, it's OK.

1164
01:25:58,415 --> 01:26:03,128
I've been watching you in the past few weeks.
I've seen the women you've been out with.

1165
01:26:03,212 --> 01:26:09,301
And now I know appearances
mean absolutely nothing to you.

1166
01:26:09,385 --> 01:26:13,264
If anything, you're pathologically unshallow.

1167
01:26:14,515 --> 01:26:16,767
- I don't know about that.
- It's true.

1168
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:20,646
Listen, I have an idea.

1169
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:24,482
Why don't we get all this food to go?

1170
01:26:24,524 --> 01:26:29,529
- Why?
- Because it'll taste a lot better in bed.

1171
01:26:37,328 --> 01:26:41,708
You know, there are
a few times in a guy's life -

1172
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:44,918
and I mean two or three, tops -

1173
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:48,338
when he comes to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

1174
01:26:48,422 --> 01:26:53,594
If he goes one way, he can continue what he's
doing and be with any girI who will have him,

1175
01:26:53,677 --> 01:26:57,764
and if he goes the other way,
he gets to be with only one woman,

1176
01:26:57,848 --> 01:26:59,933
maybe for the rest of his life.

1177
01:27:00,767 --> 01:27:04,521
It seems like by taking the second road,
he's missing out on a lot.

1178
01:27:04,605 --> 01:27:07,899
But the truth is, he gets much more in return.

1179
01:27:07,982 --> 01:27:10,735
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

1180
01:27:11,777 --> 01:27:14,280
God! What am I saying? No!

1181
01:27:14,822 --> 01:27:20,786
No, I'm sorry. Jill, this...
this isn't gonna happen. I, uh...

1182
01:27:23,289 --> 01:27:26,876
I think I'm gonna go down
that other road for once.

1183
01:27:37,427 --> 01:27:39,512
- Hi.
- Hello.

1184
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:05,412
Hello?

1185
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:09,291
Hey, hey, hey now. It's me, your love bunny.

1186
01:28:09,375 --> 01:28:12,920
I miss you and I wanna see you.

1187
01:28:13,003 --> 01:28:16,382
What's the matter? You sound upset.

1188
01:28:16,465 --> 01:28:19,175
What are you, some kind of psycho?

1189
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:25,974
Hello? Rosie?

1190
01:28:34,774 --> 01:28:36,901
Just you leave me daughter alone.

1191
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:41,530
- I don't understand.
- The jig is up, and she knows it.

1192
01:28:41,613 --> 01:28:45,075
Well, she hasn't returned my calls.
What's going on?

1193
01:28:45,158 --> 01:28:49,413
It's a little late to be worrying
about that now, don't you think?

1194
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:53,667
Besides, she went and accepted
that Peace Corps assignment.

1195
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:00,340
No offence, but I think
I have a right to hear this from her.

1196
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:02,301
I'll give you your rights.

1197
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:06,137
I'll give you your last rites,
you self-righteous little shit!

1198
01:29:07,513 --> 01:29:11,058
You know, I wanted to like you. I truly did.

1199
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:16,522
And all of that malarkey that you gave me
that night at the house. I bought into it.

1200
01:29:16,981 --> 01:29:21,152
In spite of all me better instincts,
I took the hook.

1201
01:29:22,987 --> 01:29:26,908
I don't know.
Maybe I share in the blame of it all.

1202
01:29:26,949 --> 01:29:32,078
Maybe I just... I just wanted to believe
that there was still a decent guy out there.

1203
01:29:32,162 --> 01:29:34,873
A lad that would be right for me daughter.

1204
01:29:34,956 --> 01:29:38,418
- But, sir...
- Don't speak. Just you listen!

1205
01:29:40,545 --> 01:29:44,299
Now, thankfully, as it turns out,
there is a guy out there.

1206
01:29:44,382 --> 01:29:48,803
- His name is Ralph Owens.
- RaI... Pretty-boy Ralph?

1207
01:29:48,845 --> 01:29:52,097
Don't be a smart ass. Now you listen to me.

1208
01:29:52,223 --> 01:29:56,852
They're back together,
and me daughter has a chance to be happy.

1209
01:29:56,936 --> 01:30:00,189
And you, you'll be respectin' that.

1210
01:30:07,446 --> 01:30:12,618
* Well, I dreamed I saw
the knights in armour coming

1211
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:16,871
* Saying something about a queen

1212
01:30:17,914 --> 01:30:23,753
* There were peasants singin'
and drummers drummin'...

1213
01:30:23,836 --> 01:30:28,049
Excuse me. Could you tell me what floor
Rosemary Shanahan works on?

1214
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:30,510
I think she's up in Pediatrics.

1215
01:30:30,552 --> 01:30:33,304
- Yeah. That's third floor.
- Thank you.

1216
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,065
HaI, is that you?

1217
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:47,442
Hey.

1218
01:30:47,526 --> 01:30:50,028
- What are you doing here?
- I, uh...

1219
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:54,658
I, uh... came to see Rosemary.

1220
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:55,784
Oh.

1221
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:59,079
Well, she left early.
She seemed upset about something.

1222
01:31:00,746 --> 01:31:03,916
- Any idea where she went?
- You got me.

1223
01:31:05,167 --> 01:31:07,253
Hi, HaI.

1224
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,299
Hi.

1225
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,342
Um...

1226
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:17,180
- How do you know my name?
- It's me - Cadence.

1227
01:31:34,779 --> 01:31:36,865
Oh, hi, Cadence.

1228
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,747
How are you, beautifuI?

1229
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:46,750
How come you haven't come back to see us?

1230
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,168
Um...

1231
01:31:49,293 --> 01:31:53,797
Well, me and Rosemary have been
having some problems.

1232
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:55,883
I, uh...

1233
01:31:55,925 --> 01:31:59,136
- I was really stupid.
- Oh.

1234
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:03,599
Well, why don't you go buy her a present
and then maybe you can make up?

1235
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:44,096
You were right.

1236
01:32:44,805 --> 01:32:47,224
Huh?

1237
01:32:47,307 --> 01:32:52,104
In the gym last week when you said
I was scared of women, you were right.

1238
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:59,986
- Nah, I didn't mean that. I was just...
- No, come on, HaI. It's the truth.

1239
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:03,823
I'm terrified of 'em.

1240
01:33:03,906 --> 01:33:08,661
I haven't been close to a woman...
my whole life.

1241
01:33:13,916 --> 01:33:16,002
I'm a coward, all right?

1242
01:33:25,802 --> 01:33:30,140
But why? I mean, look at you.
You're a mountain of a man.

1243
01:33:30,223 --> 01:33:36,855
You got more style than Mr Blackwell.
You're pulling in what - 28, 29 Gs a year?

1244
01:33:36,938 --> 01:33:39,858
- 29,500.
- You're the perfect catch!

1245
01:33:39,941 --> 01:33:42,819
I know, I know. It's crazy.

1246
01:33:43,777 --> 01:33:47,072
I just... have this thing.

1247
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,118
- What thing?
- It's kind of a...

1248
01:33:52,912 --> 01:33:55,789
birth defect... thing.

1249
01:33:56,999 --> 01:33:59,835
Jeez, man. I didn't know.

1250
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:02,421
- What is it?
- I have a taiI.

1251
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:05,674
Huh?

1252
01:34:05,716 --> 01:34:08,635
- A taiI.
- What do you mean, like a story?

1253
01:34:08,718 --> 01:34:11,846
No, a taiI. It's like a waggy taiI.

1254
01:34:12,931 --> 01:34:15,600
My backbone is longer
than it's supposed to be.

1255
01:34:15,642 --> 01:34:19,979
It's like a genetic abnormality.
It's a vestigiaI taiI.

1256
01:34:20,063 --> 01:34:23,233
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

1257
01:34:23,316 --> 01:34:24,901
Get out!

1258
01:34:24,984 --> 01:34:29,906
If I can't even get my best friend to accept it,
how am I supposed to expect a woman to?

1259
01:34:29,989 --> 01:34:34,243
Wait a second. Are you for reaI?
Cos if you are, I gotta see this.

1260
01:34:34,326 --> 01:34:38,497
- No, you don't wanna see it.
- No, I don't wanna. I gotta.

1261
01:34:51,051 --> 01:34:54,971
- Good Lord!
- All right, you believe me now?

1262
01:34:55,888 --> 01:34:57,974
Oh, man. It really does wag.

1263
01:34:58,516 --> 01:35:01,644
Only when I'm nervous... or happy.

1264
01:35:03,604 --> 01:35:05,690
Wow.

1265
01:35:07,942 --> 01:35:12,238
Have you ever thought about,
you know, maybe getting it cut off?

1266
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:17,075
Cut off? I don't know
why I never thought of that...

1267
01:35:17,117 --> 01:35:21,955
when I was getting pummelled in gym class
by a bunch of barking seniors!

1268
01:35:23,582 --> 01:35:26,710
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- God!

1269
01:35:29,838 --> 01:35:34,259
The damn thing is wrapped around an artery!
No doctor will touch it!

1270
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:38,638
Well... it's not so bad.

1271
01:35:40,098 --> 01:35:43,934
I guarantee you there are some girls
who would think it was adorable.

1272
01:35:44,018 --> 01:35:46,770
Like a little puppy dog.

1273
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:50,524
Really? You think it's like a puppy dog?

1274
01:35:50,649 --> 01:35:52,735
It's cute as a button.

1275
01:35:55,070 --> 01:35:58,616
- Do you wanna... pet the little fella?
- No!

1276
01:35:59,325 --> 01:36:02,244
But, you know, I'm not much of a dog person.

1277
01:36:06,498 --> 01:36:10,502
By the way, you're gonna need
a little sod on the fairway there.

1278
01:36:10,585 --> 01:36:13,087
Huh? What do you mean?

1279
01:36:14,964 --> 01:36:17,091
So, what are you doing right now?

1280
01:36:18,092 --> 01:36:21,888
- Nothing. Why?
- Can I get a lift? I gotta go see someone.

1281
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:23,640
Yeah. Sure.

1282
01:36:23,723 --> 01:36:26,643
* Seems like longer than for ever, yeah

1283
01:36:26,725 --> 01:36:29,770
* My home is now a distant land

1284
01:36:29,853 --> 01:36:33,774
* If I had one wish, I wish you could be

1285
01:36:33,815 --> 01:36:36,735
* Back on that rock in the middle of the sea

1286
01:36:36,818 --> 01:36:40,572
* My heart is calling me to the islands

1287
01:36:40,697 --> 01:36:43,784
* My home is now a distant land

1288
01:36:43,867 --> 01:36:47,663
* If I had one wish, I wish I could be

1289
01:36:47,746 --> 01:36:50,122
* Back on that rock

1290
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:53,543
Hey! Um... HaI, right?

1291
01:36:54,877 --> 01:36:57,630
- Have we met?
- It's me, Li'iBoy.

1292
01:36:59,799 --> 01:37:02,927
I met you up in the mountains with Ralph.

1293
01:37:02,969 --> 01:37:07,640
- Oh, yeah, Li'iBoy. How ya doing?
- Yeah.

1294
01:37:07,765 --> 01:37:11,352
- You look like you been working out.
- Nah.

1295
01:37:11,853 --> 01:37:14,479
So, do you know if Ralph is in the office?

1296
01:37:15,105 --> 01:37:17,023
Yeah. Ralph!

1297
01:37:20,110 --> 01:37:22,988
HaI! Hey, HaI.

1298
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:26,658
Hey. How ya doin'?

1299
01:37:26,741 --> 01:37:31,329
I'm doing great. You're looking good.
So, what can I do you for?

1300
01:37:33,582 --> 01:37:37,543
- I came here to congratulate you.
- On...?

1301
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,171
Look, um...

1302
01:37:41,005 --> 01:37:44,133
you got a great girI, and you deserve her.

1303
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:51,432
More than me. And the truth is,
I'm happy for Rosemary.

1304
01:37:52,349 --> 01:37:56,770
But I want you to understand one thing.
You better be good to her, Ralph.

1305
01:37:56,854 --> 01:38:00,857
Ralph, if you ever mess up
and make her unhappy,

1306
01:38:00,982 --> 01:38:04,903
I'll be waiting in the wings,
and I'll pounce on you. Like a tiger!

1307
01:38:04,986 --> 01:38:09,866
Like a tiger on a deer,
with a cloven hoof and with a broken arm!

1308
01:38:09,949 --> 01:38:12,744
Whoa, whoa, whoa, HaI.
What are you talking about?

1309
01:38:12,827 --> 01:38:15,330
You're back together. Let's not play games.

1310
01:38:15,413 --> 01:38:18,708
- Rosemary and I aren't back together.
- You're not?

1311
01:38:19,709 --> 01:38:25,339
Let's put it this way. Her parents are throwing
a going-away party for her as we speak.

1312
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,925
I wasn't even invited.

1313
01:38:36,642 --> 01:38:40,938
* We are building a religion,
we are building it bigger

1314
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:45,275
* We are widening the corridors
and adding more lanes...

1315
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:48,152
- This seems crazy.
- Yeah. That's cos it is.

1316
01:38:48,236 --> 01:38:51,155
- But crazy's all you got.
- Amen to that.

1317
01:38:53,991 --> 01:38:56,077
Good luck, HaI.

1318
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:15,387
Well, I could use a drink. What do you say
we slide around the side here?

1319
01:39:15,512 --> 01:39:17,973
Yeah, we'll blend in.

1320
01:39:19,182 --> 01:39:20,475
Yeah.

1321
01:39:23,353 --> 01:39:25,438
Hello?

1322
01:39:29,776 --> 01:39:31,903
- Rosie?
- Excuse me. What are you...?

1323
01:39:31,987 --> 01:39:33,946
Shh.

1324
01:39:34,029 --> 01:39:37,992
I love you. I'm not going anywhere
untiI you hear me out.

1325
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,384
What are you doing?

1326
01:39:59,179 --> 01:40:01,973
- Who are you?
- Who am...?

1327
01:40:02,056 --> 01:40:05,685
HaI, are you drunk? It's me, Mrs Shanahan.

1328
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,191
I have some things to say to your daughter.
I'm not leaving here untiI I do.

1329
01:40:11,316 --> 01:40:16,362
OK. But could you release Helga
so she can get back to work?

1330
01:40:33,879 --> 01:40:36,757
Get ready, Li'iBoy. It's showtime.

1331
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:44,138
Well, HaI, now's your chance.

1332
01:41:16,294 --> 01:41:18,672
What are you doing here?

1333
01:41:18,755 --> 01:41:22,509
Oh, my God. You're beautifuI.

1334
01:41:24,052 --> 01:41:27,138
You have no right to be here.

1335
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:32,476
- HaI, come on. This isn't working out.
- I'm OK.

1336
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,062
What the hell are you doing here?!

1337
01:41:37,523 --> 01:41:40,901
- I'm having a word with your daughter.
- It better be "goodbye"!

1338
01:41:40,985 --> 01:41:43,696
- You've got her all up...
- Steve! Shut up.

1339
01:41:50,578 --> 01:41:53,496
Rosemary, I am so sorry that I hurt you.

1340
01:41:54,497 --> 01:41:57,333
I've been... really dumb.

1341
01:41:57,417 --> 01:42:01,588
I'm immature, I'm unthoughtfuI,
I'm a friggin' idiot.

1342
01:42:04,966 --> 01:42:09,762
But I love you.
You're the only girI I've ever loved.

1343
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:16,810
And I just didn't want you to go away
without knowing that.

1344
01:42:24,318 --> 01:42:27,654
You really hurt me.

1345
01:42:27,738 --> 01:42:34,578
I know. But if you'll let me, I wanna spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

1346
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:42,210
Well, your timing is terrible.

1347
01:42:42,293 --> 01:42:47,298
I mean, I'm leaving for Kiribati
tonight for 14 months.

1348
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:54,805
I'm sorry, Rosemary.
I just can't wait that long.

1349
01:42:57,183 --> 01:42:59,268
I understand.

1350
01:43:01,103 --> 01:43:04,022
Which is why I'm going with you.

1351
01:43:09,236 --> 01:43:11,404
What?

1352
01:43:11,488 --> 01:43:16,952
It's true, Rosie. Big Kahuna here just swore
him into the Corps about a half-hour ago.

1353
01:43:17,035 --> 01:43:19,120
That's right. He's officiaI.

1354
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:24,668
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?

1355
01:43:27,378 --> 01:43:30,130
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

1356
01:43:32,007 --> 01:43:37,263
* It could never explain your heart

1357
01:43:37,721 --> 01:43:43,102
* And the touch of my lips

1358
01:43:43,602 --> 01:43:48,941
* It could never tell you my thoughts

1359
01:43:49,024 --> 01:43:53,236
* And you want me to change

1360
01:43:54,737 --> 01:43:58,116
* I can’t get used to

1361
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,618
* All you want me to be

1362
01:44:01,327 --> 01:44:05,039
* I just can’t pretend

1363
01:44:06,666 --> 01:44:10,086
* To be anyone else

1364
01:44:10,170 --> 01:44:11,713
* Cos it's not really me

1365
01:44:11,796 --> 01:44:17,092
* This is my world, this is who lam

1366
01:44:17,176 --> 01:44:21,388
* I'm not gonna give up myself

1367
01:44:21,472 --> 01:44:23,515
* To make your life better

1368
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:28,520
* She said this is how it is

1369
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:31,440
* I got my own life to live

1370
01:44:31,523 --> 01:44:33,567
* And you can either accept me

1371
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:40,031
* Or, baby, if it’s love that we share...

1372
01:44:41,324 --> 01:44:43,618
- Here's your bag, Rosemary.
- Thank you.

1373
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:46,120
- Congratulations, HaI.
- Thank you.

1374
01:44:46,204 --> 01:44:47,622
- Rosemary.
- Bye.

1375
01:44:47,705 --> 01:44:52,084
Just keep it right there at the airport.
I'll pick it up later. Congrats.

1376
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:54,670
- We love you, Rosie.
- I love you, Mom.

1377
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:59,466
And, Rosemary, you'd better
be looking after me lad.

1378
01:44:59,549 --> 01:45:01,635
I will.

1379
01:45:03,512 --> 01:45:04,930
Later, dudes!

1380
01:45:08,725 --> 01:45:13,563
* Oh, but love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1381
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:16,066
* And nobody knows like me

1382
01:45:16,149 --> 01:45:18,735
Say bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1383
01:45:26,283 --> 01:45:29,370
You... you like puppy dogs, do ya?

1384
01:45:29,453 --> 01:45:31,956
Anything to do with dogs, I melt.

1385
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,419
Why don't we go around back,
get a little drink?

1386
01:45:37,503 --> 01:45:40,005
- Sure.
- Yeah? Come on, big fella.

1387
01:45:41,006 --> 01:45:44,760
* It's a feelin' that's fiine,
and I just gotta say, hey

1388
01:45:46,886 --> 01:45:49,681
* She's really got a magical spell

1389
01:45:49,764 --> 01:45:53,226
* And it’s working' so well that I can’t getaway

1390
01:45:55,770 --> 01:46:00,066
* I'm a lucky fell a and I just gotta tell her

1391
01:46:00,150 --> 01:46:03,403
* That love her endlessly

1392
01:46:03,486 --> 01:46:08,533
* Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1393
01:46:08,616 --> 01:46:15,372
* And nobody knows like me

1394
01:46:24,465 --> 01:46:27,384
* There's something
about her hand holdin' mine

1395
01:46:27,468 --> 01:46:33,097
* It's a feelin' that's fiine,
and I just gotta say, hey

1396
01:46:33,181 --> 01:46:36,017
* She's really gotta magical spell

1397
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:42,732
* And it’s workin' so well that I can’t getaway

1398
01:46:44,233 --> 01:46:48,404
* I'm a lucky fell a and I just gotta tell her

1399
01:46:48,488 --> 01:46:51,949
* That love her endlessly

1400
01:46:52,033 --> 01:46:57,120
* Because love grows
where my Rosemary goes

1401
01:46:57,204 --> 01:47:04,753
* And nobody knows like me

1402
01:47:11,051 --> 01:47:14,805
* It is true, everything she's been through

1403
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:19,517
* And nobody knows like me

1404
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:23,771
* If you met her you'd never forget her

1405
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:27,775
* And nobody knows like me

1406
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:42,664
* We are building a religion,
we are building it bigger

1407
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:46,292
* We are widening the corridors
and adding more lanes

1408
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:50,672
* We are building a religion, a limited edition

1409
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:54,592
* We are now accepting callers
for these pendant key chains

1410
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:58,638
* To resist it is useless,
it is useless to resist it

1411
01:47:58,721 --> 01:48:02,433
* His cigarette is burning
but he never seems to ash

1412
01:48:02,517 --> 01:48:06,603
* He is grooming his poodle,
he is living comfort eagle

1413
01:48:06,687 --> 01:48:10,232
* You can meet at his location
but you better come with cash

1414
01:48:10,315 --> 01:48:14,528
* Now his hat is on backwards,
he can show you his tattoos

1415
01:48:14,611 --> 01:48:18,115
* He is in the music business,
he is calling you "Dude!"

1416
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:22,411
* Now today is tomorrow,
and tomorrow today

1417
01:48:22,494 --> 01:48:26,165
* And yesterday is weaving
in and out, out, out

1418
01:48:26,248 --> 01:48:30,251
* And the fluffy white lines
that the airplane leaves behind

1419
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:34,172
* Are drifting right in front
of the waning of the moon

1420
01:48:34,255 --> 01:48:38,301
* He is handling the money,
he's serving the food

1421
01:48:38,384 --> 01:48:41,846
* He knows about your party,
he is calling you "Dude!"

1422
01:48:41,971 --> 01:48:46,309
* Now do you believe in the one big sign?

1423
01:48:46,392 --> 01:48:49,812
* The doublewide shine
on the boot heels of your prime

1424
01:48:49,896 --> 01:48:53,815
* Doesn't matter if you're skinny,
doesn't matter if you're fat

1425
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:57,819
* You can dress up like a sultan
in your onion-headhat

1426
01:48:57,903 --> 01:49:02,073
* We are building a religion,
we are making a brand

1427
01:49:02,157 --> 01:49:05,702
* We're the only ones to turn to
when your castles turn to sand

1428
01:49:05,785 --> 01:49:09,623
* Take a bite of this apple,
Mr Corporate Events

1429
01:49:09,706 --> 01:49:13,627
* Take a walk through the jungle
of card board shanties and tents

1430
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:17,546
* Some people drink Pepsi,
some people drink Coke

1431
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:21,467
* The wacky morning DJ
says democracy's a joke

1432
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:25,971
* He says "Now do you believe
in the one big song?"

1433
01:49:26,055 --> 01:49:29,391
* He's now accepting callers
who would like to sing along

1434
01:49:29,475 --> 01:49:33,479
* He says "Do you believe
in the one true edge

1435
01:49:33,562 --> 01:49:37,399
* By fastening your safety belts
and stepping towards the ledge?"

1436
01:49:37,483 --> 01:49:41,361
* He is handling the money,
he is serving the food

1437
01:49:41,444 --> 01:49:45,824
* He is now accepting callers,
he is calling me "Dude!"

1438
01:49:45,907 --> 01:49:49,702
* Do you believe in the one big sign?

1439
01:49:49,786 --> 01:49:53,248
* The doublewide shine
on the boot heels of your prime

1440
01:49:53,331 --> 01:49:57,335
* There's no need to ask directions
if you ever lose your mind

1441
01:49:57,418 --> 01:50:01,172
* We're behind you, we're behind you,
and let us please remind you

1442
01:50:01,256 --> 01:50:05,384
* We can send a car to find you
if you ever lose your way

1443
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:42,336
* I think of you

1444
01:50:46,174 --> 01:50:48,633
* Wherever you may go

1445
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:55,682
* I know that you are only one dream away

1446
01:50:55,765 --> 01:51:00,645
* So don’t give up, baby

1447
01:51:00,729 --> 01:51:03,815
* Don’t give in

1448
01:51:04,941 --> 01:51:11,239
* If we try, we can begin again

1449
01:51:13,616 --> 01:51:16,660
* I know what we've been through

1450
01:51:17,870 --> 01:51:22,291
* But I still think of you

1451
01:51:40,058 --> 01:51:43,186
* I think of you

1452
01:51:47,315 --> 01:51:49,400
* Whenever I get down

1453
01:51:51,736 --> 01:51:54,823
* Whenever I get weary

1454
01:51:57,242 --> 01:52:00,744
* I think of you

1455
01:52:04,873 --> 01:52:06,959
* When you're not around

1456
01:52:09,128 --> 01:52:14,174
* I wonder if you hear me call out your name

1457
01:52:14,258 --> 01:52:18,887
* So don’t give up, baby

1458
01:52:18,971 --> 01:52:21,889
* Don’t give in

1459
01:52:23,391 --> 01:52:29,814
* If we try, we can begin again

1460
01:52:31,983 --> 01:52:35,194
* I know what we've been through

1461
01:52:36,446 --> 01:52:40,408
* But I still think of you

1462
01:52:58,425 --> 01:53:01,136
* I think of you

1463
01:53:06,183 --> 01:53:08,268
* Whenever I get down

1464
01:53:10,186 --> 01:53:12,688
* Whenever I get weary

1465
01:53:15,941 --> 01:53:18,694
* I think of you

1466
01:53:20,029 --> 01:53:24,825
Hey, kid. How 'bout these Rossi boots?
Do they fit like a glove or what?
