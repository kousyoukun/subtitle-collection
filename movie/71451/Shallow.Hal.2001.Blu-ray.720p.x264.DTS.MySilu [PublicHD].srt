1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,327
I heard she was
moved to another room.

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,442
Mrs. Larson?

3
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,491
It...

4
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,087
It won't be much longer, Mrs.
Larson.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,361
Oh. Well, is he
in a lot of pain?

6
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,249
No. No, no.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,086
There'll be no more pain for your husband.
He's heavily sedated.

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,081
Okay. I think I'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

9
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,811
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,121
With all the painkillers,

11
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,205
the Reverend's
not exactly himself.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,921
Look, I think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,447
I mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,048
Well, your call.

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,691
Nurse?

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,963
Yes, Reverend Larson?

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,042
Did you see the cowboy?

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,849
The cowboy?

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,767
The cowboy who gave me the
singing nickel in Pudding Town?

20
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,164
Okay, think it's time to
turn down the morphine drip.

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,087
Reverend Larson?
Your son is here.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,329
Okay, sure.
Send her in.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,004
Ladies?

24
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,082
A little privacy.

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,931
Dad?

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,327
It's me, Dad. Hal.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,801
Oh. Glad you're here,
kiddo.

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,530
Got a few things
to tell ya.

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,523
First, I want you
to promise

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,444
that no matter
what you do in life,

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,569
you will never, ever
settle for average.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,645
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,282
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,041
Huh?

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,929
Don't do what I did.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,491
I married for love, and your
mother Betty has been a nightmare.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,009
But, Dad, Mom's
name is Marian.

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,521
Listen to me.
I'm giving you pearls here.

39
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,486
And third, find yourself

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,642
a classic beauty

41
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,922
with a perfect can

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,687
and great toddies.

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,081
That will put you in good
stead with the Lord.

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,083
It's all in here.

45
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,482
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,481
Hot, young tail's
what it's all about.

47
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,243
Hot,

48
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,802
young tail.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,967
I'll make you proud, Papa.

You had me
at "Get lost."

64
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,641
Hey, what's up, Mauricio?

65
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,761
Hey, Hal.

66
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,966
How's the crowd tonight?

67
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,201
Good. I got a few bites.

68
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,851
Yeah? Can I
get you a drink?

69
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,968
I won't say no to that.

70
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,561
Whoo!

71
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,810
Two beers.

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,723
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

73
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,649
So, I didn't expect
to see you here.

74
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,529
Where's your
new girl Loni?

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,204
Lindy.
Lindy.

76
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,527
She's...
Here you go.

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,002
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was going out tonight.

78
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,122
Why not? Things
okay with you guys?

79
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,806
Yeah. A little too okay, if you
know what I'm talking about.

80
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,043
No, I don't know.
What's that mean?

81
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,610
Things are going
in the shitter.

82
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,048
Aw, jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,168
She's not.
I'm dumping her.

84
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,321
You're dumping Loni?

85
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,841
Lindy. Are you crazy?
Lindy's gorgeous.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,970
On the surface, but when you
get to know her better,

87
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,644
there's a whole
other story goin' on.

88
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,643
Yeah? How goes that?

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,884
We're sitting there, you know,
and she's got her bare...

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,450
Her bare feet
were on the couch,

91
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,921
and I notice that
her second toe is, like,

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,651
half an inch longer
than her big toe.

93
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,568
That's it?
You're breaking up over that?

94
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,885
Hey, I don't need
that circus shit.

95
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,850
Well, couldn't she get the
toe filed down or something?

96
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,688
What, then
I'm dating a nub?

97
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,847
I'm starting to think
we're jinxed here.

98
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,400
Speak for yourself,
my friend.

99
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,686
What, you got
the promotion?

100
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,484
I don't hear about
that till tomorrow.

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,326
But guess who is now officially
going out with Jill.

102
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,607
Jill? Your neighbor Jill?

103
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,603
You're going
out with Jill?

104
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,125
And she doesn't
exactly hate me.

105
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,081
Get out! You are the
luckiest man on the planet.

106
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,205
So what are you
doing here?

107
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,171
She's hostessing
until 11:00.

108
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,770
Actually,
I better get going.

109
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,569
I'll try to catch her
on the way home.

110
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,642
See if she wants
to get a drink.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,929
If I know you, that's not
all she'll be getting.

112
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,761
I'll see you later.

113
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,966
I said no.

114
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,008
No? Why not?

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,367
I don't want to have a drink.
I want to go home.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,601
Is that so hard
to understand?

117
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,569
Hey, hey, hey.

118
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,961
What's goin' on?
Are you mad?

119
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,964
No, I'm not mad.
I just...

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,929
Go on, say it.
You know what?

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,571
No matter what it is,
we're gonna work it out.

122
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,969
Hal, I'm not
attracted to you.

123
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,961
So what?
You think everyone who goes out

124
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,644
is attracted to each other?
Get real.

125
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,209
I think they're attracted to
each other in the beginning.

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,966
Oh, come on. That sounds like
a bunch of New Age hooey.

127
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,481
All right, maybe
for some people

128
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,927
there's a little spark in the
beginning, but for most,

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,686
the attraction part
happens way later. Whoa!

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,168
Just like that,
we're breaking up?

131
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,367
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,641
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all I need.

133
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,324
Why do you need
five days?

134
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,971
Because tomorrow, I'll
finally get my promotion.

135
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,806
There's gonna be parties, dinners, this, that.
Come on, I need you now.

136
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,089
You don't need me.
You'll be so busy, you won't think about me.

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,764
How can I not
think about you?

138
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,285
You live right
across the hall.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,483
I don't know, Hal. Maybe...
Maybe you should think about moving.

140
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,408
Hal, we've made a decision regarding
that wholesaler position.

141
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,725
Yes! It's about
time, Dave.

142
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,169
We decided to go with
the gal from Merrill.

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,642
She's a proven entity.
A big producer.

144
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,247
I'm sorry, man.

145
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,164
No, it's... The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

146
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,245
Hal, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, thanks.

147
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,561
You should have gotten it.
You deserved it.

148
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,008
No, I didn't. Obviously I
didn't put them in a position

149
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,448
where they had to promote me.
It's a good lesson.

150
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,285
Make yourself indispensable,
that's the key.

151
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,967
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

152
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,442
Dumped you? Don't you have to
be going out to get dumped?

153
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,847
What does that mean?

154
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,809
I just thought
it was more of a...

155
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,769
Anyway, I don't see
why you care so much.

156
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,490
You know she was
wrong for you.

157
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,208
How can you say that?
She was perfect.

158
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,281
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

159
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,931
By the way, her tits
weren't even real.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,129
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

161
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,770
Hal, I don't
understand how a guy

162
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,609
who's as nice, and loyal, and generous
as you could have such a huge flaw.

163
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,691
What are you talking about?

164
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,727
You don't think picking girls solely on
their looks may not be the best way?

165
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,168
What, am I supposed to apologize
for having high standards?

166
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,811
High standards?
In the five years I've known you,

167
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,611
every woman, I should say
girl, you've gone after

168
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,011
has been completely
out of your league.

169
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,651
What's that
supposed to mean?

170
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,882
Oh, she doesn't
mean anything by it.

171
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,884
She's just saying you're
not that good-looking.

172
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,563
Oh! I thought she was implying
something really mean.

173
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,608
No.

174
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,128
Hey, it's you.
You're the TV guru guy.

175
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,770
Tony Robbins.
Pleased to meet you.

176
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,207
Yeah! Oh, man!

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,489
So, wow! You gave advice
to whatchamacallit

178
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,126
President Clinton?
Mandela? No, no, no.

179
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,281
Gorbachev?

180
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
No, no. Pamela Anderson.

181
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,605
Right? Yeah! Give me
another handshake.

182
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,081
Wow! Man,
look at those mitts!

183
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,242
That's like grabbing
a bunch of bananas.

184
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,482
And what's up with those dogs?
How big are those?

185
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,641
Size 16, buddy.

186
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,006
Holy cannoli.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,401
You must do pretty
good with the ladies.

188
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Just one.

189
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,444
Really?
Yeah.

190
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,244
She sounds hot!

191
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,210
She is an amazing lady.

192
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,645
I bet.

193
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,404
So, what are you
doing in my town?

194
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,409
We're doing
a seminar here.

195
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,844
I help people deal with life's challenges
with more dignity and more courage.

196
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,924
That's my deal, is the courage.
I try to...

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,606
Hang on a second.
Are we gonna fall?

198
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,808
No, it just stopped.
That's weird.

199
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,241
Oh, man, yeah.
So what do we... Hang on.

200
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,651
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

201
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,801
You okay?

202
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,884
Yeah, yeah. It's just,
I feel a little lightheaded.

203
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,690
Then she dumped me.
Flat out.

204
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,167
Not even the courtesy
of a severance pop.

205
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,844
A severance pop?

206
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,729
You know, one last...

207
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,887
To ease the pain.

208
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,930
The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,526
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,647
Yeah.

211
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,121
See, the problem is
I'm kinda picky.

212
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,850
What do you mean, picky?

213
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,369
Well, for instance,
I like 'em real young.

214
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,286
Like, did you ever see Paulina in her
first Sports Illustrated layout?

215
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,328
You want a young
Paulina type?

216
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,767
Well, that face, but
with better headlights.

217
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,367
You know how hers have
kind of dimmed lately?

218
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,046
Heidi Klum's beams would do.
And her teeth.

219
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,442
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great Knockers.

220
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,887
But she's a tad muscular.

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,363
Actually, you know what?
Her ass would do, too, if she had a better grill.

222
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,444
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2.

223
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,007
But she'd have to be a little
smilier than Michelle.

224
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,084
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

225
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,250
But not as skinny.
Someone a little meatier, like Heidi.

226
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,567
But no accent.
You know those accents...

227
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,642
Yah-yah-yah-yah.

228
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,721
They really get old fast.

229
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,609
You know what I mean.
Someone like that.

230
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,922
Don't you think you're being a bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,331
Well, no.

232
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,121
I mean, you know, I'd like her to
be into culture and shit, too.

233
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,566
Okay, hypothetical situation.

234
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,202
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,806
Ooh, toughie.

236
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,046
That's a toughie.

237
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,929
How's the remaining
breast? Is it big?

238
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,808
What's your relationship
like with your parents?

239
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,091
Oh, it's excellent. I mean, my mom's hilarious.
She golfs every afternoon.

240
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,049
Actually, I don't
really remember my dad.

241
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,407
He died when
I was nine, so...

242
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,165
If you were nine, that's kind of odd.
You should remember a lot.

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,163
Yeah, but I don't.

244
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,211
My mom thinks I might have been a
little traumatized by the whole thing.

245
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,887
Anyway, all I remember
is he was great.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,288
He was a great guy, and I
really loved him. But...

247
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,809
I'm sorry you lost him.

248
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,201
Hey, listen, I know
you got a great heart.

249
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,601
You're just a bit fixated
on people's appearances.

250
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,291
So, Hal Larson, I'm gonna
do you a great favor.

251
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,771
Really?
Yeah.

252
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,320
Listen, this is how it'll work.
From this moment on,

253
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,289
whenever you meet
someone in the future,

254
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,761
you're only gonna see
what's inside them.

255
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,490
So you'll respond
to that.

256
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,689
Because that, my friend,
is where the true beauty lies.

257
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,010
Okay, Tony, I think you're
getting a little cabin fever.

258
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,845
Hold on.
What if I told you

259
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,730
you could have the most
beautiful women in the world?

260
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,327
Uh, is this kind of like
what you do in your seminars?

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,004
No, no,
this is very special.

262
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,809
This is just
between you and me.

263
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,607
Let's get up, and I'll
show you what to do. Yeah!

264
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,605
Now, you got a pattern of looking at
women and judging them by the exterior.

265
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,922
We gotta break that pattern.
All right.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,925
So has there been a time when
you were especially shallow?

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,002
You saw a woman, thought you
were better than she was?

268
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,684
All the time.
All the time.

269
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,842
Can you think of a time
when you were really shallow?

270
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,843
Oh, yeah, I got one.

271
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,251
Think about that. Ready?

272
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,567
Devils, come out!

273
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,529
What the hell are you
doin', banana hands?

274
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,090
Just hang on.

275
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,685
We gotta jolt
your nervous system.

276
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,205
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

277
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,886
Not just talk about it.
Here's what I want you to do.

278
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,689
Just relax.
All right.

279
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,046
And I won't
do that again.

280
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,804
I didn't mean
the "banana hands" thing.

281
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,881
That's okay.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,211
Close your eyes. Just relax.
And I want you to imagine that you're on a beach.

283
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,001
It's a warm day, and the sun
is just starting to set.

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,166
And you're looking in the eyes of a
woman, and you're feeling her heart.

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,607
You're seeing her soul.

286
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,241
You're feeling her spirit.

287
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,163
That's it.

288
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,005
That's it. Excellent.

289
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,320
Excellent.

290
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,324
Taxi!

291
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,561
Oh.

292
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,931
I'm sorry. I...
I thought that...

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,367
No, no, no. No. It's my fault.
I didn't see you.

294
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,649
This is your cab.
No, I'm gonna get the next cab.

295
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,886
Uh...

296
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,168
Okay.
All right.

297
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,088
Look, I'm just...
I'm just headed over to the East Side.

298
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,885
Do you want to share, or...

299
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,041
Yeah!

300
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,009
Yeah, let's take this one.

301
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,482
So, awesome.
Thank you. Terrific.

302
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,926
Where to, my friends?

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,604
East Side Plaza
for me, please.

304
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,966
Likewise.

305
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,120
What? Oh. Huh? Sorry. I just...

306
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,891
I mean, yeah, you're...
You're really pretty.

307
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,326
Yeah, right.

308
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,210
Jeez, is everybody in
this city so flattering?

309
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,646
See, I figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

310
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,721
Boston.

311
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,366
Beantown.

312
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,889
The musical fruit.

313
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,129
The more you eat,
the more you toot.

314
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,081
So, you here on
a shoot or something?

315
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
A shoot?

316
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,562
I mean, you must be
a model, right?

317
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,489
My grandmother's
not doing so well,

318
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,211
so I took a year off
from school to help her out.

319
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,170
Oh. Helping granny.
Cool.

320
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,164
Thanks.
Yeah.

321
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,931
Bye.

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,843
So, nice catching up.

323
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,291
Listen,

324
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,607
I know you'll probably think I'm some
kind of wacko for asking, but...

325
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,966
What?

326
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,408
Well, while you're here in
town, I mean, you know...

327
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,364
If you ever feel like taking a break from
hanging out with your old, sick granny,

328
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,845
you know, we could...

329
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,451
Sure. I mean...

330
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,006
Really?

331
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,845
Are you kidding?
Yeah! That'd be...

332
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,127
I would absolutely
love to, if...

333
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,084
Okay, yeah. I should
get your number, then.

334
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,726
No, no. I'll get yours,
because it would...

335
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,848
With my luck,
you'll lose mine, so...

336
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,605
Oh. No, I get it.
Very funny.

337
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,206
You got me. That was...
No, that was good.

338
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,851
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile.

339
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,161
That was harsh.
I don't need this shit.

340
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,810
Well, hey...

341
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,166
What?

342
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,124
I do want your number.
I'm sorry!

343
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,889
I don't know what...
That was dumb.

344
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,362
I was saying something...
I thought you meant... Never mind.

345
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,482
Yes. Yes.

346
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,090
Here's my phone number,
and here's my e-mail.

347
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,491
E-mail. That's...

348
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,289
Yeah. That's funny.

349
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,769
- Hello?
- Hey, mudwhistle, get dressed.

350
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,171
We're going out.

351
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,563
So Robbins gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

352
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,206
Yeah. And then...
Check this out.

353
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,410
He does this thing to me where he makes
it so I can score better with the ladies.

354
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,648
At the time I thought
it was sort of a joke.

355
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,645
But this afternoon, the first
beautiful woman I saw went for me.

356
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,960
Could be coincidence.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,487
But no. This wasn't, you know...
This was different.

358
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,608
I don't know, she went
crazy for me or something.

359
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,490
I think talking to him helped
my confidence or something.

360
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,449
'Cause I do feel
more confident.

361
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,764
Shit. Look who's here.

362
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,721
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

363
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,001
You don't?

364
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,809
No. Why would I?

365
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,003
Don't you get sick of it sometimes?
Sick of what?

366
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,288
The whole I-walk-on-all-fours
-so-I-own-the-world thing.

367
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,840
All the phony
self-deprecating crap.

368
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,366
Jeez, the guy...
Give the guy a break!

369
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,290
He's got spina bifida!
He plays the hand he was dealt.

370
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,926
Yeah. And here he comes.

371
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,761
There's a couple of
belt buckles I recognize.

372
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,808
Hey, Walt.
How you doing?

373
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,804
Do I look like I have
anything to complain about?

374
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,486
Not if you don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

375
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,847
I gotta go to the can.

376
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,200
Hey, man,
good to see ya.

377
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,361
Good to see you.

378
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,086
How you been?
Good.

379
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,883
There's a pair of panties I recognize.
How ya doing, Deb?

380
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,042
Okay, wise guy,
what's it gonna be?

381
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,088
A bottle of Dom
for my buddy here.

382
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,050
Another?
Okay, you got it.

383
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,804
And keep 'em coming.

384
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,330
What's the occasion?

385
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,727
I take it you don't read
the business section?

386
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,767
What did I miss?

387
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,126
I sold my company
to Microsoft.

388
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,611
Yeah? And
you cleaned up?

389
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,923
Well, put it this way.
If I had an ass, I'd wipe it with twenties.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,890
All right!
Congratulations!

391
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,361
Yup, I'm officially retired
and on the prowl.

392
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,407
Hey, Walt.

393
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,641

394
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,007

Nothing.

403
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,606
My friends are all out
on the dance floor.

404

spanking the planks with 'em?

Spanking the planks.

So, are they
your roommates, or...

408

No, we work together at the
Foundation Fighting Blindness.

00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,570
Building a parachute?

471
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,327
Excuse me?

472
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,849
They're a little big,
aren't they?

473
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,401
Oh, I get it. You ripped the
spinnaker on your sailboat, right?

474
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,681
I'm sorry. I just...

475
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,169
It seemed so funny seeing someone like
you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

476
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,208
Someone like me?

477
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,726
Yeah. You know,
someone so fit.

478
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,089
You are a jackass.

479
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,041
Miss, please. I'm sorry.

480
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,122
I didn't mean to offend you.

481
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,047
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

482
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,248
Whoa, whoa.
Let's start over.

483
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,244
Look, that was
really dumb of me.

484
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,245
You were probably buying 'em for someone
close to you, right? And I insulted them.

485
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,970
Well, however it is
you took it,

486
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,804
I want you to know I didn't
mean to piss you off.

487
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,208
I wanted to meet you,
and I guess...

488
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,842
I guess I'm not real
smooth sometimes.

489
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,891
Let me make it up to you.

490
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,930
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything all right?

491
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,762
So, what do you do
for a living, Rosemary?

492
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,969
I'm actually volunteering
at the hospital right now,

493
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,887
'cause I'm waiting for this
re-up thing to come through.

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,209
Re-up? What,
are you in the army?

495
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,364
Peace Corps.

496
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
Peace Corps. Wow.

497
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,411
That's very altrudocious
of you.

498
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,801
Altrudocious?
That's not a word.

499
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,682
Ah, you mean
humanidocious, right?

500
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,646
Yeah. That's the one.

501
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,371
All right.
Ready to order?

502
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,805
Yeah. Can I get
a double pizza burger,

503
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,726
chili fries with cheese, and
a large chocolate milkshake?

504
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,202
Nicely done. I'll have
the exact same thing.

505
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,850
You got it.

506
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,369
I am impressed.

507
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,568
It's nice to see a girl
order a real meal.

508
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,689
I can't stand it when you guys order
a glass of water and a crouton.

509
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,489
It ruins the whole
point of going out.

510
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,167
Yeah, well, that's probably what
I should be ordering, you know?

511
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,449
But I don't know,
no matter what I eat,

512
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,409
my weight just seems
to stay the same.

513
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,006
So I just figure, what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

514
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,289
Oh, totally. If you can get
away with it, more power to ya.

515
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,244
Don't be a smart-ass.

516
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,048
What?
No, I'm just saying, you know.

517
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,567
I feel bad for people who count calories.
It's no way to live.

518
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,844
Yeah.

519
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,810
But in return they get to
be a lot thinner than I am.

520
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,966
Uh...

521
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,565
Are you out of your mind?

522
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,246
What do you weigh?
110,115 pounds?

523
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,644
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

524
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,211
Okay.

525
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,204
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

526
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,567
Trust me, whatever you're
doing, it's working.

527
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,880
It is working.

528
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,530
Oh, go on.

529
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,206
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

530
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,166
Oops.

531
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,205
Goddang it. Rosemary, don't move.
Is your back all right?

532
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,281
Yeah.

533
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,771
Is she all right?

534
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,366
Listen, you gotta get some
decent chairs in here, man.

535
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,444
What's this shit
made out of, anyway?

536
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,807
Steel.

537
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,171
Yeah? Well, you should get it
welded better in the corners!

538
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,721
All right, then.

539
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,410
Rosemary, you sure
you're okay?

540
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,121
Yeah. I'm a little
embarrassed but

541
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,043
it's happened before,
it'll happen again.

542
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,360
Oh, man.

543
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,247
Don't be embarrassed. Listen, I beef it.
Everybody beefs it.

544
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,369
We're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

545
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,569
Listen, can you wait
here one second?

546
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,041
Oh, Hal,
just let it go.

547
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,322
Nah. Nah.

548
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,687
Hal.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

549
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,524
You guys are making fun of me
'cause I'm a little pudgy?

550
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,681
No, I wasn't making fun of you.
I was... That's fine.

551
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,643
Do me a favor.
Take a look outside.

552
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,282
You see that little
fox out there?

553
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,204
See that little number?
She's with me.

554
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,284
If you took all the women you
two have ever gone out with,

555
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,203
they wouldn't
equal one of her.

556
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,043
We're not arguing that.
No.

557
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,962
That's right.
Laugh it up, fellas.

558
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,762
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, I'm with her.

559
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,047
All right? That's it.

560
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,801
Uh!

561
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,844
What happened?
Well, let's just say

562
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,248
the score's Hal two,
mall rats zero.

563
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,721
Let me walk you to your car.

564
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,640
Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.

565
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,730
Ah, my pleasure, Rosie.

566
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,404
My mother calls me Rosie.

567
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,482
Really?
Yeah.

568
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,003
Gentlemen, can I interest you in
some chili fries and half a burger?

569
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,005
There's a lot left 'cause the little
guy couldn't finish his meal.

570
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,321
Hey.Hey.
Pussy.

571
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,567
That was nice of you.

572
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,881
Well, you're all right
in my book, too, Hal.

573
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,371
Can I have your number?

574
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,680
What number?

575
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,206
Your PIN number,
I want your money!

576
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,204
Your phone number.
What do you think?

577
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,441
Why?

578
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,003
You know, to go out.
Maybe like tomorrow.

579
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,801
Uh...

580
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,604
well, yeah.

581
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,044
I mean, sure. It's in the
book under Rosemary Shanahan.

582
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,690
I can write it down.
It's S-H-A...

583
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,444
No, I'll remember it.

584
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,727
My boss's name
is Steve Shanahan.

585
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,040
That's my father's name.

586
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,691
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

587
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,683
Yeah!

588
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,807
Yeah.

589
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,484
Your father is my boss.

590
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,131
I mean, not my boss.
He's my boss's boss.

591
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,841
I mean, I don't know him, but
I see him around the office.

592
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,204
Well, then you won't
forget my name.

593
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,970
Hal?
Yeah?

594
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,528
If I don't hear from you,

595
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,768
I appreciate everything,
anyway.

596
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,325
Cuckoo.

597
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,762
You sure you don't
want a dog?

598
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,287
Yeah, yeah.
I'm trying to lose a couple of lbs.

599
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,124
Since when do you
care about your gut?

600
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,285
I don't really, but
I'm a little nervous.

601
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,046
This girl who's coming to meet
me here is in incredible.

602
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,201
Uh-huh?

603
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,282
Like the ones on the dance
floor the other night?

604
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,684
Even better, buddy.
I'm telling you, it's almost beyond belief.

605
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,971
She's funny, she's smart, she
teaches self-esteem to sick kids.

606
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,008
And I would never believe a
girl as beautiful could have

607
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,082
such a great personality.

608
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,324
Ugly duckling syndrome.
She probably wasn't pretty till high school.

609
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,802
The personality had to
develop out of necessity.

610
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,644
You know what?
I bet you're right.

611
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,041
She's way too pretty
to be so nice.

612
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,531
Sometimes they're
ugly so long,

613
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,807
they turn pretty
and don't realize it.

614
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,925
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

615
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,684
Hey!
Hey!

616
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,800
I've been looking for you.

617
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,327
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy.
The girl with the toe.

618
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,242
Hey, Mauricio.
How ya doing?

619
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,402
Good. Did you
get my message?

620
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,929
No, no. My phone machine's not
really working there. Did you call?

621
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,243
I got tickets for
that Beatles reunion.

622
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,367
The Beatles?

623
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,488
Yeah. Well, not
the real Beatles,

624
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,449
but Paul, George and
Ringo will be there.

625
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,682
But Eric Clapton is
filling in for John.

626
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,163
It's an invitation-only
acoustic set.

627
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,083
Only about 70 people, tops.

628
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,207
Oh, man.

629
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,441
So you're in?

630
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,565
Ahhh...

631
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,287
No. Not a Clapton fan.

632
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,010
Think I'll pass.

633
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,486
Okay.

634
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,848
Well, I guess I'll see ya.
Yeah, yeah.

635
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,570
Bye, Lindy.

636
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,927
Oh, did you
see the toe?

637
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,561
Mauricio, I gotta tell
you, you got issues.

638
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,721
Don't even get me started.

639
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,770
Oh, God. There she is.
There's Rosemary.

640
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,366
Where?

641
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,090
Right there.

642
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,127
Right where?

643
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,248
Straight ahead.
Across the field.

644
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,641
Is she behind the rhino?

645
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,722
She's right there!

646
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,884
Mauricio, I want you
to meet someone.

647
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,010
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

648
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,651
Hi. Nice to meet you.

649
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,884
Holy cow. I mean, hi.

650
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,081
Is that a Members Only
jacket?

651
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,850
Yes. Yes, it is.

652
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,968
So, are you, like,
the last member?

653
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,406
Oh, man. One-nothing, Rosemary.
I told you she was good.

654
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,088
Excuse me for just one second.
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

655
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,526
Yeah, hold on.
Will you guys excuse me?

656
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,523
Want something
from the snack bar?

657
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,968
Yeah, get me a beer and nachos
with all the stuff on it.

658
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,405
You got it.

659
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,290
Does she take
the cake or what?

660
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,886
She takes
the whole bakery, Hal.

661
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,007
I told you.

662
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,209
Yes, you did. And yet
I wasn't prepared.

663
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,410
So, what are you up for?

664
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,926
I don't know.
I like the track.

665
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,002
Ah, so she's a gambler.

666
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,447
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

667
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,002
I hate the ponies. There's too
much human involvement, you know?

668
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,681
You can't trust people if
you're looking for a fair deal.

669
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
What about you?
Do you gamble?

670
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,045
No, not really.

671
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,771
I mean, I bet on pro
football now and then,

672
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,605
but to make it more exciting.
I don't care if I win.

673
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,166
Huh.

674
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,720
I've never read that book.

675
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,165
What book?

676
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,765
Things Losers Say.

677
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,447
Hey, I got a good idea.
Why don't we forget the track,

678
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,524
and I'll introduce you to
some good friends of mine?

679
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,170
Yeah?
Yeah.

680
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,169
All right.
What do you say?

681
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,566
I say okay.

682
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,880
You say okay?

683
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,564
Hi, guys. I want you to meet a
very good friend of mine. Okay?

684
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,043
This guy here is Hal.
And he's really funny.

685
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,886
How ya doing?
Good.

686
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,564
Good to meet ya.

687
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,445
Hey.

688
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,521
Wow. Oh, my God.
Look at that face.

689
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,688
She should be doing
Keebler commercials.

690
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,884
You're the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

691
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,610
What's your name,
beautiful?

692
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,681
Cadence.

693
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,888
Cadence.
That's a pretty name.

694
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,803
You know, my uncle's
name is Cadence.

695
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,046
Well, I got news
for you, Cadence.

696
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,571
I'm not putting you down
until the cows come home.

697
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,688
Put her down.

698
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,843
The cow came home.

699
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,769
What is he doing here?

700
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,808
These aren't visiting hours.

701
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,925
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

702
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,606
Oh, fine.
Pack it up.

703
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,482
And get these patients
back in their beds.

704
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,806
Should we get going?

705
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,487
Don't pay any attention
to Nurse Sourpuss.

706
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,005
Sourpuss.

707
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,247
Hey! I got an idea.
Do you want to play the kissing game?

708
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,402
I do!
Me!

709
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,522
Yeah?
Want me to go get a bottle?

710
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,171
No, no. Want to
get the lipstick?

711
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,287
Get lipstick.

712
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,044
Yeah, okay.

713
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,522
What we do is
we put on the lipstick.

714
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,962
The kisser kisses as much as they
can until the lipstick comes off.

715
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,611
Oh, cool.
I want to go first.

716
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,529
Then I'm going last.

717
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,687
Jesse.

718
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,444
Hey,
they don't have

719
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,608
anything I can catch,
do they?

720
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,762
They don't have
anything you can catch.

721
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,605
I didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

722
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,684
You're just a bunch of phonies
like my Uncle Cadence.

723
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,366
I'll bet you're here so you
can get out of school. Right?

724
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,329
Is that right?
Yeah.

725
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,401
Give me some lipstick.

726
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,481
Put on lipstick.

727
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,366
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

728
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,331
I'm serious. A lot of people get squeamish
in that situation, and you were so...

729
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,004
Rosemary? Is that you?

730
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,082
Dr. Sayed!
How's it going?

731
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,207
Good. Who is this?

732
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,361
This is my friend Hal.

733
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,771
Hal.
Good to meet you.

734
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,009
Be nice to her.
She's a good girl. All right.

735
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,003
Bye, Rosemary.
Bye.

736
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,082
I'm serious. That's what
these kids need,

737
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,165
is, like, a stranger who isn't afraid to
just be with them and play with them.

738
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,368
It builds their
self-confidence.

739
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,562
Why would anybody
be afraid of 'em?

740
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,042
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

741
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,451
Come on.

742
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,851
This is a nice
street you live on.

743
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,924
Yeah, this is my street.
You want to come up?

744
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,965
Yeah. But I don't
think I should.

745
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,611
Why not?
It's only 9:00.

746
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,728
I know. I don't
think it's a good idea.

747
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,690
Oh, no. Did I do something? No.

748
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,009
You've been really cool.

749
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,081
Hi, Hal.

750
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,448
Oh, hey, Jill.
Rosemary, this is my neighbor Jill.

751
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,561
Hi.
Hi.

752
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,051
Nice...

753
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,040
Sorry.

754
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,326
Nice to meet you.

755
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,091
Nice to meet you,
too, Jill.

756
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,722
I gotta go meet some friends,
so I'll see you guys later.

757
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,529
Bye.
Bye.

758
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,931
Come up.

759
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,888
No.

760
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,567
What? I thought... I thought
we were having a good time.

761
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,087
We were. It's just, you know,
Hal, I'm not used to all this.

762
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,650
Used to what?

763
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,081
Hal, you've been
really nice to me today.

764
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,969
I really appreciate it.
But...

765
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,771
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

766
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,161
I don't have
other boyfriends.

767
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,321
Bullshit.

768
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,168
Well, I had one boyfriend.

769
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,251
It was kind of recently, actually,
but it didn't work out.

770
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,362
Hmm. You've been
burnt, huh?

771
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,764
No. That's just it.

772
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,811
I... I've never been close
enough to anybody to get burnt.

773
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,441
Please! With a mug
like that?

774
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,090
You must be fighting
'em off daily.

775
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,605
Right! I mean, I saw the way your
friend Mauricio looked at me.

776
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,921
I thought he was gonna shoot
me with a tranquilizer gun

777
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,240
and tag my ear.

778
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,926
Don't worry.
He's been acting really weird lately.

779
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,446
Especially around
really pretty girls.

780
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,366
Hal,

781
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,371
do me a favor and stop saying that I'm
pretty, and that I'm not fat, okay?

782
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,450
'Cause it makes me
uncomfortable.

783
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,568
Okay. You have a problem
with compliments?

784
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,000
Look. I know what I am
and I know what I'm not.

785
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,162
I'm the girl who gets really good
grades and isn't afraid to be funny.

786
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,802
And I'm the girl who has a lot of friends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

787
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,481
I'm not beautiful, okay?
And I never will be.

788
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,484
And I'm fine with that.
You know?

789
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,325
But when you go around saying
that I'm something that I'm not,

790
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,607
it's just,
it's not nice.

791
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,571
Whoa, Rosemary.
You're starting to scare me.

792
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,685
I mean,
I really like you,

793
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,369
but I have to assume you're a little nutty
if you really believe you're not beautiful.

794
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,680
Grow up, Hal.

795
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,005
Rosie. Wait a second.

796
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,766
Well, it was too
good to be true.

797
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,166
Hmm?

798
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,206
Rosemary. Turned out
to be a total psycho.

799
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,490
Her self-image is
so far off, it's scary.

800
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,763
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

801
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,604
What? What are you
talking about?

802
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,082
All I ever did was tell her
how perfect she was.

803
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,288
Really?
Yeah.

804
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,687
Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

805
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,488
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

806
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,926
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

807
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,210
Yeah, right. I'm probably
more immature than you,

808
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,011
but at least I have
a bigger willie.

809
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,287
Yeah, bigger
than a mouse's.

810
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,561
What the hell was that?

811
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,364
I said your willie's
bigger than...

812
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,441
I heard,

813
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,801
but it took you,
like, eight seconds.

814
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,087
You can't make a comeback
after eight seconds.

815
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,482
You got three seconds.
Five, tops.

816
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,042
That's why they call it
a quip. Not a slowp.

817
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,003
All right, you got anything better to read?
I gotta fire off a missile.

818
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,529
Hi. Is this
a bad time, or...

819
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,401
No.

820
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,531
Um...

821
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,451
I just wanted to apologize
for last night.

822
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,443
You don't have
to apologize.

823
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,961
Yeah, I do.

824
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,487
I called you, like, immature or
sophomoric or something like that.

825
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,927
- I know you're not...
- My God. Hal!

826
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,810
You gotta get in here
and look at this turd.

827
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,406
It looks just like
Klinger from M*A*S*H.

828
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,401
Um...

829
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,286
Why don't we get out of here?
Okay.

830
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,805
Coffee?

831
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,650
Mmm.

832
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,003
Excuse me. Are you
ready to order?

833
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,686
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers,
bacon, one with relish.

834
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,489
Thank you.

835
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,361
OW.

836
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,121

837

Hey, you know, I've been meaning
to ask you, were you adopted?

866
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,770
No. why?

867
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,926
'Cause your dad
has that weird accent.

868
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,970
And also, I've seen him
around the office.

869
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,122
I gotta say, I don't see
the slightest resemblance.

Really?
Yeah.

871

Everybody says if you put a wig
on him, he'd look just like me.

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,682
Would you
look at who's here now?

873
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,046
Come here, my darlin'.

874
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,610
Hi, Daddy.

875
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,167
Rosie, honey.

876
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,520
Mom.

877
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,648
Good to see ya.

878
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,485
Hal Larson, the guy
I was telling you about.

879
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,971
It's great to
meet you, sir.

880
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,684
Likewise.

881
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,091
Nice to meet you, Hal.

882
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,242
The pleasure is mine,
Mrs. Shanahan.

883
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,086
Wow, I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

884
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,441
What the hell...
What the hell is that you've got on?

885
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,489
We were at the beach.

886
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,723
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

887
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,805
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to do that for me.
Let's just keep it casual.

888
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,085
Casual.

889
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,368
Hey, Dad, Hal's one of your great
untapped resources down at the company.

890
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,681
Why don't you tell him
some of your ideas?

891
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,764
Oh, so you've got
a few ideas, do ya?

892
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,768
It is risky, but
the rewards are greater, too.

893
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,851
The point is, only a company
with a solid reputation like JPS

894
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,570
could ever market
this product.

895
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,166
Hal, let me take your plate.

896
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,561
Oh, thank you.
It was delicious.

897
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,722
Can I get you boys
some coffee?

898
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,167
I'd love a cup
of tea, darlin'.

899
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,402
Maybe just a drop
of the hard stuff.

900
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,206
Yeah, I'll just have a cup of joe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

901
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,770
I have to say, Hal, I'm impressed
with a lot of your ideas.

902
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,968
Some of them are
dog shit, you know,

903
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,283
but for the most part, you seem
to have done your homework.

904
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,727
So I'd like you to do
something for me. Okay.

905
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,010
Well, I'm meeting with me executive
committee Monday morning,

906
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,447
and I'd like you to
make a presentation.

907
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,045
Seriously?

908
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,248
Well, nothing fancy,
you understand.

909
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,041
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

910
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,610
Great. I'd love to.

911
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,042
Oh, and by the way,

912
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,162
you can cutout
the act now.

913
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,241
Excuse me?

914
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,405
You think I got as far as I did
in me life by bein' a fool?

915
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,244
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and I admire that.

916
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,449
Hell, I wish I had a hundred
more like yourself.

917
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,488
We'd be the number-one firm
in the country.

918
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,370
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

919
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,169
I'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

920
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,210
I told you to cut
the shit out, all right?

921
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,090
Look, Rosemary
is me daughter,

922
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,288
and God knows
I love her dearly.

923
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,287
But I think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

924
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,966
marching along with the
Dallas Cheerleaders.

925
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,961
Uh...

926
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,723
I don't understand.

927
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,644
I'm telling you
the truth, Hal.

928
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,290
And the truth is I haven't been able
to bounce me daughter on me knee

929
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,362
since she was two.

930
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,289
You know, I've read
about people like you.

931
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,166
People like me?

932
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,323
You superachievers with
your impossible standards.

933
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,483
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing measures up.

934
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,168
It never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

935
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,651
You think they're just
an extension of you,

936
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,529
like your billion-dollar
company,

937
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,889
or your $20 million Lear Jet and
your Picasso out in the front hall.

938
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,284
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

939
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,251
Go on.

940
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,006
When I first met Rosemary,

941
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,651
she told me she knew
she wasn't that good-looking.

942
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,609
I could not
believe my ears.

943
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,327
How can a person
this beautiful

944
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,531
possibly interpret what she sees in the
mirror to be anything other than that?

945
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,568
Well, now I know.

946
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,040
Is everything okay?

947
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,611
Huh? Yeah,
everything is fine.

948
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,170
Just fine.

949
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,971
What?

950
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,009
Nothing. I just can't
believe how lucky I am.

951
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,568
You swear to God
you're not gonna laugh?

952
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,404
Come on,
I'm not gonna laugh.

953
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,727
Ah.

954
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,325
Daddy like.

955
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,971
♪ The look on your face

956
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,440

957
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,006

00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,483

00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,727
Get over here, Houdini.

963

And I'm not gonna give up...

965
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,323
Hi.

966
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,562
Yes, I am.

967
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,486
Everything's so perfect.

968
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,369
It's a little scary.

969
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,601
I know.

970
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,002
But in a good way.

971
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,050
To have so much to lose.
That's nice.

972
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,086
I'm gonna call you later.

973
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,650
Okay.

974
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,290
Bye.

975
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,690
Forget something?

976
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,042
Oh, hey.
Hi. I'm glad I caught you

977
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,521
before you went to work.
What's up?

978
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,570
I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to come over tonight.

979
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,120
Open a bottle of wine,
maybe watch a video.

980
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,680
Uh...

981
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,370
Nah. Thanks, though.

982
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,006
And in summation,
I feel that these measures

983
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,845
will help JPS and
all of our customers.

984
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,962
Nice job, Hal.
Thank you.

985
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,405
Nicely done.
I appreciate it.

986
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,164
Hal, I stand corrected.

987
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,890
Thank you.

988
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,521
Hal, I need to see you
in me office straight away.

989
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,011
Sure.

990
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,929
Sit yourself down.

991
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,328
So, what'd you think?

992
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,724
I'll be gettin' to
that in a minute.

993
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,361
I want to talk to you about that little
conversation we had the other night

994
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,284
and all of them things
you said to me.

995
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,529
Well, I'm more than just a little
embarrassed, having said what I said.

996
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,251
I think me daughter
is lucky to have you.

997
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,044
No, sir.
I'm the lucky one.

998
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,524
Indeed.

999
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,730
Well, now, as to
your meeting in there.

1000
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,529
Sure, it was first-rate.

1001
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,008
Yeah?
Oh, yes.

1002
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,129
Hal, I'm gonna
level with ya.

1003
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,725
I need your balls.

1004
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,247
Sir?

1005
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,041
I need a man around that can give
it to me straight, you know?

1006
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,727
Whether the news
be good or bad.

1007
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,643
So I've decided.

1008
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,566
From now on, you'll be
working directly for me.

1009
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,644
Uh...

1010
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,007
I don't know
what to say but...

1011
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,447
Thank you.

1012
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,127
Well, a thank you
will do just fine.

1013
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,321
Well, get the fuck out.

1014
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,447
Oh, okay.

1015
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,329
Congratulations
on your promotion!

1016
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,401
Oh, sorry.

1017
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,450
No, no. Come in, come in.
I want you to meet Rosemary.

1018
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,648
Rosemary, this is Jen and Artie.
Hi.

1019
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,451
Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

1020
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,449
As in Steve?

1021
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,202
Yeah, he's my dad. Oh, God, which
reminds me, I gotta meet him for lunch.

1022
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,851
I'll see you this
weekend, okay?

1023
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,201
Mmm.

1024
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,010
It was really nice
to meet you guys.

1025
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,570
Mind if I take
a little sliver?

1026
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,085
Go for it.

1027
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,283
Beauty.

1028
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,169
Want a plate?

1029
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,571
Uh-uh.

1030
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,923
I know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

1031
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,850
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

1032
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,729
Hey, it was the least
we could do,

1033
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,609
seeing as how you worked
so hard to become

1034
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,967
"indispensable"
to the company.

1035
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,210
Is that that new thing
called sarcasm?

1036
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,126
Hal, we all know you're
about as deep as a puddle.

1037
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,885
In fact, that used to be
part of your charm.

1038
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,486
But this just
flat out sucks.

1039
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,561
What are you
talking about?

1040
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,726
If you have one ounce of integrity
left, you'll break it off immediately,

1041
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,087
before you hurt
the poor girl.

1042
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,242
I gotta give you credit for being more
proactive and starting to meet women

1043
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,641
and who knows? Maybe you are
on a roll here or something.

1044
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,008
But don't you think it's time
to raise the bar a little?

1045
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,683
I mean, at first I thought you
were in a slump, you know?

1046
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,240
I could, as a friend,
look the other way

1047
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,681
while you banged a few fatties
and got it out of your system.

1048
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,081
But there's lots of
good-eatin' fish out there.

1049
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,481
You don't have to snack
on carp any more.

1050
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,643
I suppose the girls we partied
with a couple weeks ago downtown

1051
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,449
were a couple of carp, too?

1052
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,090
No. Laura, the one
with the whiskers,

1053
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,367
she looked more
like a catfish.

1054
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,046
Oh, I see.
And what about Marie?

1055
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,011
Pop some bolts on her neck,

1056
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,128
and the villagers
will be chasing her.

1057
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,168
And Vicki?
Who?

1058
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,651
Vicki!
Who's Vicki?

1059
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,809
Vicki Vicki.
With the short brown hair.

1060
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,248
Vicki? I thought that was a guy.
I was calling her Vic!

1061
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,846
Oh, you're out
of your mind!

1062
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,287
Look, I know I'm being
a little harsh on you here.

1063
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,921
I think real friends are obligated
to be honest with each other.

1064
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,401
This one that you're dating now...
Jeez.

1065
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,645
Careful.

1066
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,770
Hey, all I'm saying is she's
got cankles, for God's sake.

1067
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,887
What?

1068
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,325
Cankles!
She's got no ankles.

1069
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,165
The calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

1070
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,480
She has coffee cans.

1071
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,766
I know what cankles are.

1072
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,649
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

1073
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,724
You know what?
I know what you're doing here.

1074
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,324
You're scared.

1075
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,447
Scared?

1076
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,844
Yup. This is exactly what you did with
the knockout with the weird frinkly toe.

1077
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,209
You're inventing reasons to dump
girls 'cause you're afraid.

1078
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,443
All right, look. I admit Rosemary
is kind of cool, all right?

1079
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,524
But admit you wouldn't
talk to that woolly mammoth

1080
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,728
if her father wasn't
company president.

1081
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,441
What?

1082
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,690
I guarantee you've never met anyone
like this guy who's coming with us.

1083
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,886
You're gonna love him.

1084
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,325
Great.

1085
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,640
What's his girlfriend like?

1086
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,881
I haven't met her.

1087
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,247
They just started going out.
Oh, there he is.

1088
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,763
Walt!

1089
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,046
At your cervix!

1090
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,881
Hey, you recognize
these panties?

1091
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,123
Rosemary, don't
steal my lines.

1092
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,884
You two know each other?

1093
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,086
Yeah!

1094
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,687
Gosh, Walt's been volunteering
down at the hospital for years.

1095
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,847
Oh.

1096
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,241
So where's this
mystery girl?

1097
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,161
She should be
here any minute.

1098
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,600
Hey, I want you
to be honest.

1099
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,809
Is this outfit too
"Hey, look at me"?

1100
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,367
No, no.
It's very subtle.

1101
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,323
Sorry I'm late.

1102
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,447
Tanya.

1103
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,688
Oh. What a surprise.

1104
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,925
♪ I've spent all
summer days drivin'

1105
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,244

holidays ruined

1106

01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,249
I'm going with you.

1109
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,004
What are those for?

1110
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,209
Ever walk through a truck-stop
men's room on your hands?

1111
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,281
Want anything?

1112
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,283
Potato chips.
And dip.

1113
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,320
Cut it out.

1114
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,606
So, Tanya, I had no idea that you and
Walt were, you know, seeing each other.

1115
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,967
Yeah. You got a light?

1116
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,322
It's actually
a very funny story.

1117
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,483
Because he had been asking me
out for a really long time,

1118
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,040
and I was always
kind of unavailable.

1119
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,202
And then just when
he had given up,

1120
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,204
I broke up with my boyfriend,
and there he was.

1121
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,567
So I asked him out.

1122
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,081
So he kind of grew
on you, huh?

1123
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,085
Exactly. I mean,
you gotta admit,

1124
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,448
when you first meet him,
it is Kind of jarring.

1125
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,081
I mean, you kind of don't
even know what goes where.

1126
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,369
But anyway, the timing couldn't
have been more perfect,

1127
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,330
because he had just
sold his company,

1128
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,482
and he has all this
time on his hands,

1129
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,370
and we can plan things,

1130
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,649
and travel, and go
shopping and...

1131
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,766
Well, I guess
timing's everything.

1132
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,602

Hi.

1144
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,090
You remember Li'iBoy?

1145
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,610
Li'iBoy. Yeah.

1146

How are you?

1147
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,606
Mahalo, Rosemary.

1148
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,045
How you doing?
Great.

1149
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,170
Wow. Do they still got
you out in Sierra Leone?

1150
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,488
No, no. Now they got
me near my home.

1151
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,404
I'm on this island in the
South Pacific called Carabas.

1152
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,891
I'm Hal.

1153
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,962
Oh, I'm sorry. Hal.

1154
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,205
These are my
Peace Corps buddies.

1155
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,046
This is Ralph Owens and Li'iBoy.
This is Hal Larson.

1156
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,849
What's up?
Li'iBoy.

1157
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,611
So, what are you guys
doing up here?

1158
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,690
Li'iBoy's been stuck in the office
training for the last 30 days,

1159
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,161
so I dragged him up here
and threw him on the slopes.

1160
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,890
It wasn't pretty.

1161
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,123
I knew this Hawaiian guy
in high school

1162
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,761
who went out for the hockey team.
It was funny as shit.

1163
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,045
Anyway, it's great
to see you again.

1164
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,443
You look happy.

1165
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,885
Thanks. I am.

1166
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,971
Well, we got a long
drive back, so...

1167
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,841
Bye.

1168
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,331
Bye.
Good to meet ya.

1169
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,051
You okay?

1170
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,886
Uh-huh.

1171
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,161
It's just that do you remember how I
told you that once I had a boyfriend?

1172
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,651
Uh-huh.

1173
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,245
That was him.

1174
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,726
You're welcome.
Sure. What's your name?

1175
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,765
Excuse me, Mr. Robbins.
Can I have a word with you, sir?

1176
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,330
Sure, but I gotta
catch a plane.

1177
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,050
It's only gonna
take a minute.

1178
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,045
A few weeks ago, you got trapped
in an elevator with my friend.

1179
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,361
Oh, yeah! Hal.
He was a great guy. Yes.

1180
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,522
He was having relationship
troubles. How is he?

1181
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,961
That's a matter
of debate.

1182
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,526
Really?

1183
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,888
Anyway, apparently, you
gave him like a pep talk,

1184
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,363
and now he's under the impression
that he can get any woman he wants.

1185
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,688
And you don't think he can?

1186
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,886
I don't know. Whatever.

1187
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,842
But see, the point is, lately the
only women he wants are ugly.

1188
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,888
Who says they're ugly?

1189
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,564
Bausch & Lomb.

1190
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,688
And very fat,
some of them.

1191
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,570
It's like Hal has
lowered his whole...

1192
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,086
Jesus, you've got
a big noggin.

1193
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,286
Thanks for noticing.

1194
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,567
My new book has
a chapter on blurting.

1195
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,165
You might want
to pick it up.

1196
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,890
Yeah, I'll check into that.

1197
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,770
Anyway, I mean, did
something go wrong here?

1198
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,241
Is he having
a nervous breakdown?

1199
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,607
No. Haven't you
heard the phrase,

1200
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,330
"Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder"?

1201
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,444
Yeah. Did you ever hear the
song Who Let the Dogs Out?

1202
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,527
It can't be that bad.

1203
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,125
Look, exactly what did
you do to him, man?

1204
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,561
I altered his perception
a little bit.

1205
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,441
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew it!

1206
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,403
You messed with his
eyesight, right? No.

1207
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,403
No. You hypnotized him.

1208
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,689
No. I dehypnotized him.
He's been hypnotized his whole life.

1209
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,762
He's totally focused
on the outside.

1210
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,486
I helped him
see inner beauty,

1211
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,291
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

1212
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,684
How can he see their inner beauty
when he doesn't even know them?

1213
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,445
Inner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

1214
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,884
But how can he not
feel them when he's...

1215
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,804
The brain sees what the
heart wants it to feel.

1216
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,248
All right, look. Let's just out
through the old crapcake here, huh?

1217
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,810
Okay.

1218
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:12,084
Sir, don't you think it's
wrong to brainwash someone?

1219
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,049
Don't you think
you're brainwashed?

1220
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,168
All you know about beauty
is programmed.

1221
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,926
TV, magazines, movies, they all tell
you what's beautiful, what isn't.

1222
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,526
How's this any different?

1223
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,321
Look, I didn't come here to debate you!
I just want my friend back!

1224
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,962
Now, isn't there some kind of
word or phrase or something

1225
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,530
to take the whammy off him?

1226
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,045
Of course.
But if we do that,

1227
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,363
he'll go back to judging
everybody by the outside.

1228
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,010
Is this what
he really wants?

1229
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,162
I don't care!

1230
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,965
It's what I want!
I want my friend back!

1231
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,365
I gotta go. I gotta catch my plane.
I'm really sorry.

1232
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,082
Look, a man's reputation, dignity and
furniture are being trashed here!

1233
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,051
Perhaps irreparablyl For God's
sakes, his job is in jeopardy!

1234
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,327
His job? Really?

1235
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,765
Yes. And it's a great job.

1236
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,443
I just wanted to give him a gift.
I didn't want him to get hurt.

1237
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,330
You seem to know him
better than I do, so...

1238
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,050
It's a shame to let it go.

1239
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,645
Oh, it's a tragedy.

1240
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,929
So, what'd you wanna
talk to me about?

1241
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,282
Um, Ralph called me.

1242
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,690
Your old boyfriend Ralph?

1243
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,288
Well, he was also my division
leader in Sierra Leone.

1244
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,206
Anyway, he's shipping out
to Carabas in 10 days,

1245
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,009
and he wants me
to go with his group.

1246
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,402
What? You and Ralph?
Carabas?

1247
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,131
They're in
an economic meltdown.

1248
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,206
100,000 people need medical supplies
and food, and they want me to help.

1249
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,126
How can you be so selfish?

1250
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,440
Sorry?

1251
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,244
I mean, you know
what I'm saying.

1252
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,642
You bump into pretty boy Ralph on
Friday, the sparks are flying,

1253
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,441
and now you're gonna go
and save the world in Carabas?

1254
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,091
This has nothing to do
with me and Ralph.

1255
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,161
Yeah, right.

1256
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,563
He's obviously
crazy about you.

1257
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,881
He's got
the heart of a saint.

1258
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,124
I could practically see the halo around his head.
I can't compete with that.

1259
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,280
Okay, first of all, you're probably
the only person in the free world

1260
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,601
to ever refer to Ralph
as a "pretty boy."

1261
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,446
Secondly, that halo around his
head, it's called psoriasis.

1262
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,569
You can't stand near him
without getting flaked on.

1263
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,446
And thirdly, and fourthly, yes, he's
a great guy and he cares about me,

1264
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,444
but he had no
sense of humor.

1265
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,404
And I'm in love with
an even greater guy.

1266
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,486
Well, then how come I don't
have any say in this thing?

1267
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,891
You do. That's why...

1268
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,969
Oh, no! God,
are you okay?

1269
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,407
I think so.

1270
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,323
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

1271
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,641
You should be sorry!
It's an outrage!

1272
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,881
I'll go get help.

1273
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,764
Okay. Are you okay,
sweetie?

1274
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,490
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1275
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,324
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.

1276
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,962
It's this flimsy-ass
four-star restaurant.

1277
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,884
Just sit right there.
I'm gonna go talk to the manager, okay?

1278
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,883
I'll be right back.

1279
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,243
Good night.
Thank you.

1280
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,922
Look, I'm not blaming you,
but I need an extra chair.

1281
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,002
My girlfriend's jinxed
when it comes to furniture.

1282
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,844
Yeah. I know.
I'm so sorry.

1283
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,684
The waiter told me
what happened.

1284
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,762
One sec. Mclntosh's.

1285
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,240
Yes.

1286
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,361
Hello?

1287
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,204
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

1288
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,281
What?

1289
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,046
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

1290
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,043
What the hell
are you talking about?

1291
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,202
I just saved
your life, baby.

1292
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,281
What?

1293
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,169
I've been looking
for you all day.

1294
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,244
I'm at Mclntosh's with Rosemary.
Look, I got kind of a...

1295
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,890
Are you looking
right at her?

1296
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,564
No, I'm talking to
the hostess. But...

1297
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,364
Don't... Hal!

1298
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,930
Look, I got a situation here.
I'll call you later.

1299
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,002
Look away!

1300
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,405
Um, I was just talking
to the hostess.

1301
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,050
Right. That would be me.

1302
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,088
No, no. It was
the other hostess.

1303
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,570
Sir, I'm the only
hostess in the restaurant.

1304
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,049
Let me apologize about the booth.
We are so sorry.

1305
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,243
We've replaced your date's side
with a new chair, a strong one,

1306
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,810
and the meal's
gonna be on us.

1307
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,967
Okay.

1308
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,361
Well, thank you.

1309
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,169
You're welcome.

1310
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:45,042
Excuse me. Did you...
Did you move us?

1311
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,010
No. Second table
on the right.

1312
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,880
Well, then maybe you can explain
to me why that robust woman

1313
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,769
is eating
my girlfriend's...

1314
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,684
Hey! Now she's eating
my clams casino!

1315
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,763
Sweetie, are you okay?

1316
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,440
Excuse me.

1317
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,522
Mclntosh's. Tiffany.

1318
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,524
Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,250
Okay.

1320
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,411
We're two friends walking.
Just walking. Hey, come on.

1321
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,131
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what I thought!

1322
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,326
Which is?

1323
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,801
You weren't irresistible
to women.

1324
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,850
He hypnotized you so that
really ugly girls that you met

1325
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,646
from then on would, to you,
look like Supermodels.

1326
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,007
If they had inner beauty
or some baloney.

1327
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,844
See, you could get
any woman you desired

1328
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,163
because you were suddenly
desiring the undesirable!

1329
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,287
You get it?

1330
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,409
No, not exactly.
Let me put it this way.

1331
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,087
It's like he gave you
beer-goggle laser surgery.

1332
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,491
Now wait a second.

1333
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,168
So what you're saying is all the pretty girls
I've met lately are not really pretty?

1334
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,324
All right. Let's
look at the facts.

1335
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,609
They were funny,
smart and nice.

1336
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,649
Pretty girls
are not funny!

1337
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,530
And they're certainly
not nice! Not to us!

1338
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,284
When I found out
what he did,

1339
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,328
I had him take
the trance away.

1340
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:34,930
When I said, "Shallow Hal
wants a gal," you were cured.

1341
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,922
You're out of your mind.
Do you know that?

1342
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,525
I'm going back
to the restaurant.

1343
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,921
Hal. Hal, come on.

1344
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,365
Hal!

1345
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,329
You never called me back.

1346
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,801
What happened to you?
Excuse me?

1347
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,005
Oh.

1348
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,723
I've got my hair back.

1349
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,802
It's me Katrina.

1350
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,807
We shared the cab together.

1351
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,447
I'm in town taking care
of my grandma,

1352
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,171
'cause, she's
been sick, and...

1353
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,130
Oh, wait a minute!
I get it!

1354
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,449
Nice try, Mauricio.
Where'd you find this one?

1355
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,641
No, it's me Katrina.

1356
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,241
From Boston.
The magical fruit?

1357
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,927
Yes, I remember Katrina.
But the thing is, you're not...

1358
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,686
I never told you about...

1359
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,962
Katrina! How the heck are ya?
Give me some sugar.

1360
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,890
I didn't recognize you.
The hair and the...

1361
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,491
You screwed me! I had a beautiful,
caring, funny, intelligent woman,

1362
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,449
and you made her
disappear!

1363
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,650
Oh, no, I didn't.

1364
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,371
I just made Rosemary appear!

1365
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,807
There's a difference.
It's called reality.

1366
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,046
Hey, if you can see something and hear it and
smell it, what keeps it from being real?

1367
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,520
Third-party perspective.

1368
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,001
Other people agreeing
that it's real.

1369
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,803
Okay, let me ask
you a question.

1370
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,484
Who's the all-time
love of your life?

1371
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,366
Wonder Woman.

1372
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,447
Okay. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

1373
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,411
Would it bother you if the rest of the
world didn't find her attractive?

1374
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,006
Not at all.
'Cause I know they'd be wrong.

1375
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,323
That's what I had
with Rosemary!

1376
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,449
I saw a knockout!
I don't care what anybody else saw!

1377
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,602
Jeez, I never thought
about it that way.

1378
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,404
Hey, I guess I really
did screw you, huh?

1379
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,450
What am I gonna do?

1380
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,722
Hey, hey, don't panic.

1381
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,689
We just get Tony
Robbins back here,

1382
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,524
he puts the Vulcan
mind meld on ya.

1383
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,489
Then puts you back under.
Good idea.

1384
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,006
For now, avoid Rosemary.

1385
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,081
Why?

1386
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,401
Because if you see
the real Rosemary,

1387
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,084
hypnosis is not
gonna help you.

1388
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,248
You'll need, like, the Jaws of Life
to get that image out of your head.

1389
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,042
Hal, open up. It's me.

1390
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,568
I hear you in there.

1391
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,608
Just a sec, Rosemary.

1392
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,488
What happened to you?

1393
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,363
I got something in my eye.
I had to run back here and flush it out.

1394
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:50,731
Yeah, the hostess said that you seemed
a little cuckoo. So, come on, open up!

1395
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,962
I can't. Uh...

1396
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,289
We'll club her. No.

1397
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,362
I'm... I'm...

1398
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,649
I'm very sick!
I've got...

1399
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,325
CC!

1400
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,481
You have what?

1401
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,851
Contagious conjunctivitis.

1402
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,967
I'll take my chances.
Now open up.

1403
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,808
All right.
In a minute.

1404
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,844
I told you it was nasty.

1405
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,242
Are you okay? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

1406
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,369
Nah, nah. I got some drops.
I'll be fine.

1407
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,128
Oh, my poor baby.

1408
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,409
Yeah. Well, I should
probably rack out.

1409
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,130
This has taken
a lot out of me.

1410
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,201
Okay.

1411
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,531
Um...

1412
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,803
Well, I'll call you in the morning
and see how you're doing.

1413
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,043
Great. Great. Bye-bye.

Hal, is everything
all right with you?

1424
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:39,084
Yeah. Yeah, it's topnotch, sir.
Why?

1425
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:44,170
Well, it's just that Rosemary's
been telling me that

1426
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:49,087
she's having a bit of trouble getting you
on the telephone the last couple of days.

1427
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,731
Now, I wouldn't be working
you too hard, would I?

1428
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,526
Uh... Uh...

1429
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,729
No. I mean,
I'm working hard,

1430
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,486
but I guess I've just been a
little preoccupied with things.

1431
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,689
But I'll make sure and
touch base with her.

1432
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,690
Right.

1433
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,201
Right. Okay, then.

1434
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,007
I'm sorry. You know, apparently
this Tony Robbins guy

1435
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,163
is tougher to track down
than I thought he'd be.

1436
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,730
I'll come through.
I promise.

1437
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,040
I can't keep this up.

1438
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,610
Hey, calm down.

1439
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,405
I don't know, Mauricio.
Maybe I should just see her.

1440
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,642
I mean, I do have...

1441
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,288
You know, the heart thing.

1442
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,887
Maybe that's enough
to overcome her appearance.

1443
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,526
It could be like in that
movie, The Crying Game.

1444
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,251
When the guy fell in love
with a beautiful woman?

1445
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,800
When he found out it was
a guy, it didn't matter,

1446
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,882
'cause he already loved her.

1447
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,171
Hal, if a set of hairy boys was your
biggest hurdle here, I'd say go for it.

1448
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,445
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1449
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,921
Hey, what's up, Rosemary?

1450
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,729
What happened yesterday?

1451
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,801
Hmm?

1452
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,841
Well, I stopped by your office to say
hi, but you just took off running.

1453
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,646
Oh, you're kidding.

1454
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,801
No.

1455
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,121
What were you doing?

1456
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,531
I was jogging.

1457
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,125
In your business suit?

1458
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,362
I had a sweat suit
underneath.

1459
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,204
Is everything...

1460
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,045
What's going on, Hal?

1461
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,566
Things haven't felt
the same lately.

1462
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,608
NO?
No.

1463
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,844
Hey, Rosemary, don't worry.
Everything...

1464
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:58,881
I'm just in a little funk right now,
and everything's gonna be fine.

1465
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,405
Yeah. So...

1466
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,690
I guess I'll talk to
you tomorrow? Bye.

1467
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,730

It's Jill.

1480
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,281
Coming.

1481
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,846
Hey, what's up?

1482
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,602
My girlfriend just
bailed on me,

1483
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:07,321
and I was wondering if I could
take you out to dinner.

1484
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,964
I'm sorry.
Tonight's not good.

1485
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,042
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a stiff.

1486
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,043
I want to talk to you
about some stuff.

1487
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,485
No, really. I can't.

1488
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,961
Please? We'll go
out just as friends.

1489
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,886
Oh, come on.
You gotta eat, don't you?

1490
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,529
Can I ask you
something, Jill?

1491
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,647
Yeah.

1492
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,969
Why the sudden thaw?

1493
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,161
Well, I've been
thinking a lot.

1494
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,564
Hal, I made a mistake.

1495
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,724
I shouldn't have
broken it off with you.

1496
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,484
Well, you didn't
really break it off.

1497
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,409
I mean, we only had
that one date.

1498
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,926
You did the right thing.
We were going nowhere.

1499
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,241
We had nothing in
common, remember?

1500
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,961
But that was my fault.
I shut you out emotionally.

1501
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,522
We could have had more things
in common if I'd wanted to.

1502
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,923
Mr. Shanahan,
how are you this evening?

1503
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,121
How am I? Tonight I feel like a
thorn amongst a bed of roses.

1504
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,804
Your table's ready.
John will seat you.

1505
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,881
Right this way, please.

1506
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,525
I'm just gonna go
to the ladies' room.

1507
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,729
Okay, Rosie,
we'll be at the table.

1508
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,530
Yeah. See, why did you shut
me out in the first place?

1509
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,568
I'm just curious.

1510
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:45,441
Well, frankly, I guess I
thought you were shallow.

1511
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,527
Me?

1512
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:54,642
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficial dickwad.

1513
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,326
I don't know.
What do you call it?

1514
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,167
Hal, it's okay. I've been
watching you the past few weeks.

1515
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,129
I've seen the women
you go out with.

1516
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:10,491
And now I know appearances mean
absolutely nothing to you.

1517
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,285
If anything, you're
pathologically unshallow.

1518
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,720
I don't know
about that.

1519
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,881
It's true.

1520
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,564
Listen, I have an idea.

1521
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,281
Why don't we get all
this food to go? Why?

1522
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,606
Because it'll taste
a lot better in bed.

1523
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,684
You know, there are a few
times in a guy's life,

1524
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,122
and I mean like two
or three, tops,

1525
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,409
when he comes to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

1526
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,723
If he goes one way, he can
continue what he's doing

1527
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,529
and be with any girl
who will have him,

1528
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,844
and if he goes the other way, he
gets to be with only one woman,

1529
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,127
maybe for the rest
of his life.

1530
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:06,486
Now, it seems like by taking the second
road, he's missing out on a lot.

1531
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,042
But the truth is, he gets
much more in return.

1532
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,811
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

1533
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,604
God, what am I saying? No!

1534
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,641
No, I'm sorry. Jill, this...
This isn't gonna happen.

1535
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,886
I think I'm gonna go down
that other road for once.

1536
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,924
Hi.
Hello.

1537
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,481
Hello?

1538
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,291
Hey, hey, hey now.

1539
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,408
It's me, your love bunny.

1540
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:14,131
I miss you and
I wanna see you.

1541
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,250
What's the matter?
You sound upset.

1542
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,891
What are you,
some kind of psycho?

1543
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,411
God.

1544
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,529
Hello? Rosie?

1545
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,006
Just you leave me
daughter alone.

1546
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,206
I don't understand.

1547
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,681
The jig is up,
and she knows it!

1548
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,923
Well, she hasn't returned my calls.
What's going on?

1549
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,447
It's a little late to be worrying
about that now, don't you think?

1550
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,889
Besides, she went and accepted
that Peace Corps assignment.

1551
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,482
No offense, Mr. Shanahan, but I think
I have a right to hear this from her.

1552

little shit!

1554
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,927
You know, I wanted to like you.
I truly did.

1555
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,210
And all of that malarkey that you
gave me that night at the house,

1556
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,566
I bought into it.

1557
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,284
In spite of all me better
instincts, I took the hook.

1558
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,965
I don't know.
Maybe I share in the blame of it all.

1559
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,206
Maybe I just... I just wanted to believe
that there was still a decent guy out there.

1560
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,886
A lad that would be
right for me daughter.

Don't speak!
Just you listen!

1563
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,326
Now, thankfully, as it turns
out, there is a guy out there.

His name is Ralph Owens.

Pretty boy Ralph?

1566
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,282
Don't be a smart-ass.
Now you listen to me.

1567
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:58,729
They're back together, and me
daughter has a chance to be happy.

No, a tail.
It's like a waggy tail.

My backbone is longer
than it's supposed to be.

Only when I'm nervous
or happy.

thought about, you know,

1641
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:19,088

class by a bunch of barking seniors!
