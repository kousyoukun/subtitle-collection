1
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,421
Mrs Larson?

2
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,299
It...

3
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:03,539
It won't be much longer, Mrs Larson.

4
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:09,652
Well, is he in a lot of pain?

5
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:13,723
No. No, no. There will be
no more pain for your husband.

6
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:16,260
He's heavily sedated.

7
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:20,964
OK. I think I'm gonna go
send little Hal in now.

8
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,195
No. No, no. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

9
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,536
With all the painkillers,

10
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:30,338
the reverend's not exactly himself.

11
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,005
Look, I think my boy has a right
to say goodbye to his father.

12
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:37,608
I mean, the man means
everything in the world to him.

13
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:44,154
Well, your call.

14
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:47,585
Nurse?

15
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,029
Yes, Reverend Larson?

16
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,832
- Did you see the cowboy?
- The cowboy?

17
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:59,865
The cowboy who gave me
the singing nickel in Pudding Town?

18
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:05,211
OK. I think it's time
to turn down the morphine drip.

19
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,054
Reverend Larson, your son is here.

20
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,390
OK, sure. Send her in.

21
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:20,397
Ladies? A little privacy.

22
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,577
Dad?

23
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:44,385
It's me, Dad. Hal.

24
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,623
Glad you're here, kiddo.
Got a few things to tell ya.

25
00:02:55,503 --> 00:03:01,442
First, I want you to promise
that no matter what you do in life,

26
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,570
you will never ever settle for average.

27
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:07,581
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,349
Second, don't be satisfied
with routine poontang.

29
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:18,187
Don't do what I did.

30
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:23,530
I married for love, and your mother
Betty has been a nightmare.

31
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:27,062
But, Dad, Mom's name is Marian.

32
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,436
Listen to me. I'm giving you pearls here.

33
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,874
And third, find yourself

34
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,942
a classic beauty

35
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:47,886
with a perfect can, and great totties.

36
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:53,358
That will put you in good stead
with the Lord. It's all in here.

37
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,029
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:03,537
Hot young tail's what it's all about.

39
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:10,342
Hot young tail.

40
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:31,207
I'll make you proud, Papa.

41
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,267
Jackass, can you not hear me down there?

42
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,075
I don't want anything to do with you,
you little warthog.

43
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,651
You had me at "Get lost."

44
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,682
- What's up, Mauricio?
- Hey, Hal.

45
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,353
- How's the crowd tonight?
- Good. I got a few bites.

46
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:54,557
- Can I get you a drink?
- I won't say no to that.

47
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,001
Two beers.

48
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,699
- Two Buds?
- Two Buds.

49
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:05,437
So, I didn't expect to see you here.
Where's your new girl Loni?

50
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,536
- Lindy.
- Lindy.

51
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:10,549
- She's...
- There you go.

52
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:14,018
Actually, I didn't tell her
I was goin' out tonight.

53
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,213
Why not? Things OK with you guys?

54
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:20,054
Yeah, a little too OK,
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

55
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:24,592
- What does that mean?
- Things are going in the shitter real quick.

56
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,999
Jeez, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why is she dumping you?

57
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,197
- She's not. I'm dumping her.
- You're dumping Loni?

58
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:34,868
- Lindy.
- What, are you crazy? Lindy's gorgeous.

59
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:39,471
On the surface, but when you get to know her
better, there's a whole other story goin' on.

60
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:41,777
Yeah? How goes that?

61
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:47,289
We're sitting there, you know, and
she's got her bare feet up on the couch,

62
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:52,419
and I notice that her second toe is, like,
half an inch longer than her big toe.

63
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:57,958
- That's it? You're breaking up over that?
- Hey, I don't need that circus shit.

64
00:07:58,036 --> 00:08:01,563
Well, couldn't she get the toe
filed down or something?

65
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,335
What, then I'm dating a nub?

66
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:07,003
I'm starting to think we're jinxed here.

67
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,569
- Speak for yourself, my friend.
- What, you got the promotion?

68
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:16,212
I don't hear till tomorrow, but guess who
is now officially going out with Jill.

69
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:20,520
Jill? Your neighbour Jill?
You're going out with Jill, your neighbour?

70
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:23,062
And she doesn't exactly hate me.

71
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,927
Get out!

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,664
You are the luckiest man on the planet.
So what are you doing here?

73
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,673
She's hostessing until 11. I better get going.

74
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:37,575
I'm gonna try to catch her on the way home,
see if she wants to get a drink.

75
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:40,774
If I know you, that's not all she'll be gettin'.

76
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:44,015
See you later.

77
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:47,951
- I said no.
- No? Why not?

78
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:53,653
I don't wanna have a drink with you. I wanna
go home. Is that so hard to understand?

79
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:59,066
- What's goin' on? Are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I just...

80
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:03,538
Go on, say it. You know what?
No matter what it is, we're gonna work it out.

81
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:08,002
Hal, I'm not attracted to you.

82
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:14,241
So what? You think everyone who goes out
is attracted to each other? Get real.

83
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,150
They're attracted to each other
in the beginning.

84
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,989
Oh, come on. That sounds
like a bunch of New Age hooey.

85
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,787
Maybe for some people
there's a little spark in the beginning,

86
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:30,063
but for most, the attraction part
happens way later. Whoa!

87
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,839
What? That's it?
Just like that, we're breaking up?

88
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,432
Well, we were never going out.
We just had one date.

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,641
Come on. Hey, let's stay together five days.
That's all I need.

90
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:46,982
- Why do you need five days?
- Tomorrow I'm finally getting my promotion.

91
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,856
There's gonna be parties, dinners,
this, that. I need you now.

92
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,190
Hal, you're gonna be so busy,
you won't even think about me.

93
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:57,893
How am I not gonna think about you?
You live right across the hall.

94
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:02,870
I don't know, Hal.
Maybe you should think about moving.

95
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:21,088
Hal, we've made a decision
regarding that wholesaler position.

96
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:24,094
Yes! It's about time, Dave.

97
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:28,189
We decided to go with the gal from Merrill.

98
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:31,724
She's a proven entity. A big producer.

99
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,070
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, it's...

100
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,741
The gal's a proven entity.
What the heck you gonna do?

101
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:46,251
- Hal, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

102
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,120
- You should have gotten it. You deserved it.
- No, I didn't.

103
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:54,024
I didn't put them in a position
where they had to promote me or lose me.

104
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,327
It's a good lesson.
Make yourself indispensable, that's the key.

105
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:01,961
And to make matters worse,
Jill dumped me last night.

106
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,564
Dumped you? Don't you have to be
going out to get dumped?

107
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:09,601
- What does that mean?
- Well, I just thought it was more of a...

108
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:14,116
Anyway, why do you care so much?
Jill wasn't right for you and you know it.

109
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,778
How can you say that? She was perfect.

110
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:20,311
When are you gonna get it?
They're just well-formed molecules.

111
00:11:20,425 --> 00:11:23,053
And by the way, her tits weren't even real.

112
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:26,995
Well, I could squeeze 'em.
That's real enough for me.

113
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:29,658
Hal, I don't understand how a guy

114
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:35,674
who's as nice and loyal and generous as you
could have such a huge flaw.

115
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,800
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:42,813
It never occurred to you that picking girls
on their looks may not be the best way?

117
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:46,080
Am I supposed to apologise
for having high standards?

118
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:49,918
High standards? In the five years
I've known you, every woman -

119
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:54,290
I should say girl - you've gone after
has been completely out of your league.

120
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:57,853
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She doesn't mean anything by it.

121
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:01,562
She's just saying
you're not that good-looking.

122
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,798
Oh! I thought she was implying
something really mean.

123
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:06,704
No.

124
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:31,199
Hey, it's you. You're the TV guru guy.

125
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:35,205
- Yes, Tony Robbins. Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah! Oh, man!

126
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:38,538
So, wow! You gave advice
to whatchamacallit.

127
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,043
- President Clinton? Mandela?
- No, no, no.

128
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,740
- Gorbachev?
- No, no. Pamela Anderson.

129
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,752
Right? Yeah! Give me another handshake.

130
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:52,484
Wow! Man, look at those mitts!
It's like grabbing a bunch of bananas.

131
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,493
And those dogs. How big are those?

132
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:57,085
- Size 16, buddy.
- Holy cannoli.

133
00:12:57,163 --> 00:13:00,724
- So you must do pretty good with the ladies.
- Just one.

134
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:02,825
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:07,766
She sounds hot!

136
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:10,505
- She is an amazing lady.
- I bet.

137
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:14,479
- So, what are you doin' in my town?
- We're doing a seminar here.

138
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,916
I help people to deal with the challenges
in life with more dignity and courage.

139
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,923
That's my deal, is the courage. I try to...

140
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:26,894
Hang on a second. Buddy, hang on.
The elevatorjust stopped. That's weird.

141
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:29,055
- Man, yeah. So what do we...?
- Hang on.

142
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,727
- Are you OK? I'm fine.
- You OK?

143
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:35,066
Yeah, yeah. It's just I feel a little light-headed.

144
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:45,273
Then she dumped me. Flat out. Without
even the courtesy of a severance pop.

145
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,478
- A severance pop?
- You know, one last...

146
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:54,092
To ease the pain. The nice ones'll
sometimes throw you that.

147
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,890
It sounds like you've had
some odd relationships.

148
00:13:56,963 --> 00:14:00,262
Yeah. See, the problem is I'm kinda picky.

149
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:06,273
- What do you mean, "picky"?
- Well, for instance, I like 'em real young.

150
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:10,605
Like, did you ever see Paulina
in her first Sports Illustrated layout?

151
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:14,876
- You're looking for a young Paulina type?
- That face, but with better headlights.

152
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:18,282
You know how hers
have kind of dimmed lately?

153
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:21,049
Heidi Klum's beams would do. And her teeth.

154
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:24,455
Or that Britney Spears girl.
She's got great knockers.

155
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:27,188
But she's a tad muscular.

156
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:31,460
Actually, you know what? Her ass would do,
too, if she had a better grille.

157
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:34,502
Like Michelle Pfeiffer
back when she did Grease 2,

158
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,870
But she'd have to be
a little smilier than Michelle.

159
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:41,468
Like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
before she got Stamosed.

160
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:45,605
But not as skinny. Someone meatier,
like Heidi, but without the accent.

161
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:48,708
You know those accents: yah-yah-yah-yah.

162
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,450
They really get old fast. You know
what I'm saying. Someone like that.

163
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:57,961
Don't you think you're being a little bit
shallow in the way you look at women?

164
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:03,161
Well, no. I mean, you know,
I'd like her to be into culture and shit, too.

165
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,494
OK, hypothetical situation.

166
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:11,270
Which do you prefer, a girlfriend
missing one breast or half a brain?

167
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,403
Ooh, toughie. That's a toughie.

168
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,683
How's the remaining breast? Is it big?

169
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:22,848
- How's your relationship with your parents?
- Excellent. I mean, my mom's hilarious.

170
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,119
She golfs every afternoon.

171
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:29,390
Actually, I don't really remember my dad.
He died when I was nine, so...

172
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,127
If you were nine, you should remember a lot.

173
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,133
Yeah, but I don't.

174
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:38,263
My mom thinks I might have been
a little traumatised by the whole thing.

175
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,901
Anyway, all I remember is, he was great.

176
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:45,448
He was a great guy,
and I really loved him, but...

177
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:50,242
I'm sorry you lost him.
Hey, listen, I know you got a great heart.

178
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,448
You're just fixated on
the outside appearances of people.

179
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:56,493
- Hal Larson, I'm gonna do you a great favour.
- Really?

180
00:15:56,561 --> 00:16:01,294
This is how it'll work. From this moment on,
whenever you meet someone in the future,

181
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,697
you're only gonna see what's inside them.

182
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:09,172
So you'll respond to that, because that,
my friend, is where the true beauty lies.

183
00:16:09,242 --> 00:16:12,075
OK, Tony, I think
you're getting a little cabin fever.

184
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,907
Hold on. What if I told you by doing this,

185
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:19,110
you could have the most beautiful women
in the world and they'd want you?

186
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:23,382
- Is this like what you do in your seminars?
- No, no, this is very special.

187
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:27,654
This is just between you and me.
Let's get up and I'll show you what to do.

188
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:31,687
Now, you got a pattern of looking at women
and judging them by the exterior.

189
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,667
We gotta break that pattern.
So has there been a time

190
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:39,901
when you were especially shallow with a
woman, where you thought you were better?

191
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,633
- All the time.
- All the time.

192
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:44,612
Is there one specific time
where you were really shallow?

193
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,205
- Oh, yeah, I got one.
- Think about that.

194
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,479
Devils, come out!

195
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:53,147
- What the hell are you doin', banana hands?
- Just hang on.

196
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:56,283
- We gottajolt your nervous system.
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

197
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,887
It's notjust talking about it. Here's what
I want you to do. Just relax for a moment.

198
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:04,991
- I won't do that again.
- I didn't mean the "banana hands" thing.

199
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,235
Close your eyes. Just relax. And I want you
to imagine that you're on a beach.

200
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,074
It's a warm day and the sun
is just starting to set.

201
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:19,116
And you're looking in the eyes of a woman,
and you're feeling her heart.

202
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,687
You're seeing her soul.

203
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:25,484
You're feeling her spirit.

204
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:28,287
That's it. That's it.

205
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:30,886
Excellent. Excellent.

206
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,533
Taxi!

207
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:48,038
I'm sorry. I thought that...

208
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:53,349
No, it's my fault. I didn't see you.
This is your cab. I'm gonna get the next cab.

209
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:58,218
- OK.
- All right.

210
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:04,222
Look, I'm just headed over to the East Side.

211
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,232
- Do you wanna share, or...?
- Yeah!

212
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,969
Yeah, let's take this one.
So, awesome. Thank you. Terrific.

213
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,677
- Where to?
- East Side Plaza for me, please.

214
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:20,215
Likewise.

215
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:38,264
- What?
- Oh. Huh? Sorry. I just...

216
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:42,899
I mean, yeah, you're really pretty.

217
00:18:46,146 --> 00:18:50,310
Yeah, right. Jeez,
is everybody in this city so flattering?

218
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,086
I figured you weren't from around here.
Where you from?

219
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:56,248
- Boston.
- Bean Town.

220
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,318
The musical fruit.

221
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:03,030
The more you eat, the more you toot.

222
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,264
So, are you here on a shoot or something?

223
00:19:09,673 --> 00:19:12,506
- A shoot?
- I mean, you must be a model, right?

224
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:26,120
My grandmother's not doing so well, so I
took a year off from school to help her out.

225
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:29,125
Oh. Helping granny. Cool.

226
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:40,630
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

227
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,734
Bye.

228
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:47,513
So, nice catchin' up.

229
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:59,758
Listen, um... I know you'll probably think
I'm some kind of wacko for asking, but...

230
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,153
What?

231
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:05,824
Well, while you're here in town,
I mean, you know...

232
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,535
if you ever feel like taking a break from
hangin' out with your old sick granny,

233
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,234
you know, we could...

234
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,972
- Sure. I mean...
- Really?

235
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,947
Are you kidding? Yeah! That'd be...

236
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,314
I would absolutely love to, if...

237
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:25,249
OK, yeah. I should get your number, then.

238
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,450
No, no. I'll get yours, because it would...

239
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:31,985
- With my luck, you'll lose mine, so...
- Oh. I get it.

240
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:35,122
Very funny. You got me.
That was... No, that was good.

241
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,296
You could've just said no,
but you went the extra mile. That was harsh.

242
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,873
I don't need this shit.

243
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,999
What?

244
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,341
- I do want your number.
- Oh, I'm sorry!

245
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,515
I don't know what... That was dumb.
I was saying something...

246
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:55,110
I thought you meant... Never mind. Yes. Yes.

247
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,316
Here's my phone number,
and here's my email.

248
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,355
- Email. That's...
- Yeah. That's funny.

249
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,672
- Hello?
- Mudwhistle, get dressed. We're goin' out.

250
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:26,981
This Robbins guy gave you free therapy
while you were in the elevator?

251
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:29,149
Yeah. And then - check this out -

252
00:21:29,293 --> 00:21:33,524
he does this thing to me where he makes it
so I can score better with the ladies.

253
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:35,690
At the time I thought it was ajoke.

254
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:39,725
But this afternoon, the first
beautiful woman I saw went for me.

255
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:43,331
- Could be coincidence.
- Yeah, but no. This was different.

256
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:46,741
It was like she went crazy
for me or something.

257
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:51,577
I think maybe talking to him helped my
confidence, cos I do feel more confident.

258
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:56,082
Shit. Look who's here.

259
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:03,154
What's the matter?
You have a problem with Walt?

260
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:06,061
- You don't?
- No. Why would I?

261
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:09,968
- Don't you just get sick of it sometimes?
- Sick of what?

262
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,301
The whole "I walk on all fours
so I own the world" thing.

263
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,934
Plus all that phony self-deprecating crap.

264
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:19,570
Jeez... Give the guy a break!
He's got spina bifida!

265
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:24,084
- He's just playing the hand he was dealt.
- Yeah. Here he comes.

266
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:31,649
- There's a couple of belt buckles I recognize.
- Hey, Walt. How you doin'?

267
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:34,662
Do I look like I have
anything to complain about?

268
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:37,562
Not if you don't mind
bunions on your knuckles.

269
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,101
I gotta go to the can.

270
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:42,968
- Hey, man, good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

271
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:45,735
- How you been?
- Good.

272
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,972
There's a pair of panties I recognize.
How ya doing, Deb?

273
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,172
OK, wise guy, what's it gonna be?

274
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:56,219
- How about a bottle of Dom for my buddy?
- Another? OK, you got it.

275
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,916
- And keep 'em coming.
- What's the occasion?

276
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,461
- You don't read the business section?
- What did I miss?

277
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:07,056
- I sold my company to Microsoft.
- Yeah? And you cleaned up?

278
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,966
Well, if I had an ass, I'd wipe it with twenties.

279
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,039
All right! Congratulations!

280
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:15,369
I'm officially retired and on the prowl.

281
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,443
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Sally.

282
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:20,540
I got a leash. Would you like
to take me for a walk?

283
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:22,273
Come on, boy.

284
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,284
Catch ya later.

285
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:33,860
Hi.

286
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:36,992
Hi.

287
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:41,001
- Hal.
- I'm Bella.

288
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:46,198
- So, what's up?
- Nothing.

289
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,507
- My friends are all out on the dance floor.
- Yeah?

290
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,347
- How come you're not spanking the planks?
- Spanking the planks!

291
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,352
Are they your roommates, or...?

292
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:59,549
No, we work together
at the Foundation Fighting Blindness.

293
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,082
Cool. I used to know a deaf guy.

294
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:04,855
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes!

295
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,296
All right.

296
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,235
What in the name of all that is holy...?

297
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:27,987
- Do you need help?
- What? Come on!

298
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:49,501
Hal?

299
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,179
It's ten o'clock. We gotta go.

300
00:25:55,518 --> 00:26:00,717
- What are you talking about?
- Hal, we gotta go do that thing.

301
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:04,157
- You know, at the place.
- What thing?

302
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:09,724
Hey, sorry, ladies.
I gotta steal your dance partner here.

303
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:14,262
- What are you doing?!
- I am rescuing you.

304
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,466
- From what?
- From what?!

305
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:25,777
From a pack of stampeding buffalo,
that's from what!

306
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,285
Come join us. I'm goin' after the redhead.
You can have your pick of the other two.

307
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:40,732
You mean you get the hyena, and I choose
between the hippo and the giraffe?

308
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:46,263
Don't be intimidated, man. They don't bite.
Let's go! I'm gettin' back in there.

309
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,971
Hey, go nuts.

310
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:01,381
Hey, Jill.

311
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,868
Mauricio, it's Hal. Pick it up.

312
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,774
Look, man, I don't know what the hell
was the matter with you last night.

313
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:22,310
First you wouldn't dance with the hotties,

314
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,476
and then we go to the IHOP, and those hotties
are even hotter, and you disappear!

315
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,576
Oh, my...

316
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,281
I gotta call you back. Something came up.

317
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:00,782
Building a parachute?

318
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:05,014
- Excuse me?
- They're a little big, aren't they?

319
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:11,529
Oh, I get it. You ripped the spinnaker
on your sailboat, right?

320
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:23,274
Sorry. It seemed so funny seeing someone
like you holding up a pair of old-lady trou.

321
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,940
Someone like me?

322
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,541
Yeah. You know, someone so fit.

323
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,579
You are ajackass.

324
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:38,290
Miss, please. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

325
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:43,534
Hey, unibrow, why don't you double
your dosage and leave me alone?

326
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:48,302
Whoa, whoa. Let's start over.
Look, that was really dumb of me.

327
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:52,573
You were probably buying 'em for
someone close to you, and I insulted them.

328
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,115
However you took it, I want you to know
I didn't mean to piss you off.

329
00:28:56,183 --> 00:28:59,311
I wanted to meet you, and I guess...

330
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:04,356
I guess I'm not real smooth sometimes.

331
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,950
Let me make it up to you.

332
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:10,156
Excuse me, Miss. Is everything all right?

333
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:24,870
So, what do you do for a living, Rosemary?

334
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:28,110
I'm actually volunteering
at the hospital right now,

335
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:33,088
cos I'm waiting for
this re-up thing to come through.

336
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:36,387
Re-up? What, are you in the army?

337
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:40,931
- Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps. Wow.

338
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,559
That's very altrudocious of you.

339
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:47,530
"Altrudocious"? That's not a word.

340
00:29:47,606 --> 00:29:50,803
Oh! You mean humanidocious, right?

341
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,581
- Yeah. That's the one.
- All right. Ready to order?

342
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:58,742
Yeah.

343
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:07,389
Can I get a double pizza burger, chili fries
with cheese and a large chocolate milkshake?

344
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:12,195
Nicely done. I'll have the exact same thing.

345
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,096
You got it.

346
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,104
I am impressed.
It's nice to see a girl order a real meal.

347
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:22,007
I hate it when you guys order
a glass of water and a crouton.

348
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,772
It ruins the whole point of goin' out.

349
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:27,440
That's probably what I should be ordering.

350
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,578
But, I don't know, no matter what I eat,
my weightjust seems to stay the same.

351
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:35,453
So I figure, what the hell?
I'm gonna eat what I want.

352
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,518
Totally. If you can get away with it,
more power to ya.

353
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:45,359
- Don't be a smart ass.
- What are you...? What?

354
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:47,428
No, I'm just saying, you know.

355
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:51,407
I feel bad for people who count calories.
It's no way to live.

356
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:56,073
Yeah. But in return they get to be
a lot thinner than I am.

357
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:03,344
Are you out of your mind?
What do you weigh? 110, 115 pounds?

358
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:08,827
Which one of my butt cheeks
are you talking about?

359
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:11,529
OK.

360
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:13,724
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

361
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:18,166
Trust me, whatever you're doin',
it's working. It is working.

362
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,729
Go on.

363
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:22,503
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

364
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:25,509
Oops.

365
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:30,580
- Goddang it.
- Don't move. Is your back all right?

366
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:32,643
- Yeah.
- Is she all right?

367
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:35,588
Yeah. You gotta get
some decent chairs in here, man.

368
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,182
What's this shit made out of, anyway?

369
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,053
Steel.

370
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:46,396
Yeah? Well, you should
get it welded better in the corners!

371
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:49,561
- All right.
- Rosemary, you sure you're OK?

372
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,236
Yeah. I'm a little embarrassed, but
it's happened before, it'll happen again.

373
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,406
Oh, man. I...

374
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,481
Don't be embarrassed.
Listen, I beef it. Everybody beefs it.

375
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:06,183
Looks like we're too late.
The food's probably all gone.

376
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:15,200
- Listen, can you wait here one second?
- Hal, just let it go.

377
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:17,600
Nah. Nah.

378
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:20,002
Hal.

379
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:27,438
You guys are so funny, making fun of me
cos I'm a little pudgy, right?

380
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:32,509
- No, I wasn't making fun of you. I was...
- Do me a favor. Take a look out the window.

381
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:37,456
You see that little fox out there?
You see that little number? She's with me.

382
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:43,327
If you took all the women you two have ever
gone out with, they wouldn't equal one of her.

383
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,230
- We're not arguing that.
- No.

384
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,229
That's right. Laugh it up, fellas.

385
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:55,072
And tonight, when you're hugging
your pillow, remember, I'm with her.

386
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:57,475
All right? That's it.

387
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:03,312
What happened?

388
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:07,380
Well, let's just say the score's
Hal two, mall rats zero.

389
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:09,983
Let me walk you to your car.

390
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:16,193
- Well, thanks for lunch, Hal.
- My pleasure, Rosie.

391
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:19,299
- My mother calls me Rosie.
- Really?

392
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,838
Yeah.

393
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:25,343
Gentlemen, can I interest you
in some chili fries and half a burger?

394
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:29,313
There's a lot left cos the little guy
couldn't finish his meal.

395
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:31,508
- Hey, hey.
- Pussy.

396
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,319
- That was nice of you.
- Well, you're all right in my book, too, Hal.

397
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,916
- Can I have your number?
- What number?

398
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:42,463
Your PIN number. I want your money.

399
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,397
Your phone number. What do you think?

400
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:47,959
Why?

401
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:51,164
You know, to go out. Maybe, like, tomorrow.

402
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,750
Well, yeah.

403
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:07,153
I mean, sure. It's in the book
under Rosemary Shanahan.

404
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:10,557
- I can write it down. It's S-h-a...
- No, I'll remember it.

405
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:14,621
- My boss's name is Steve Shanahan.
- That's my father's name.

406
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:17,724
Not JPS Steve Shanahan?

407
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:19,828
Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:34:19,939 --> 00:34:24,239
Your father is my boss. I mean,
not my boss, but he's my boss's boss.

409
00:34:24,344 --> 00:34:28,109
I mean, I don't know him,
but I see him around the office.

410
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:32,179
Well, then you won't forget my name.

411
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,793
- Hal?
- Yeah?

412
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:56,005
If I don't hear from you,
I appreciate everything anyway.

413
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:01,374
Cuckoo!

414
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:07,955
You sure you don't want a dog?

415
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:11,720
Yeah, yeah. I'm tryin' to lose a couple of LBs.

416
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:15,697
- Since when do you care about your gut?
- I don't really, but...

417
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,224
I am a little nervous because of
this girl who's coming to meet me.

418
00:35:19,336 --> 00:35:22,396
- She's incredible.
- Uh-huh?

419
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:24,497
Like the ones on the dance floor?

420
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:28,774
Even better, buddy. I'm telling ya,
it's almost beyond belief.

421
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:34,150
She's funny, she's smart,
she teaches self-esteem to sick kids...

422
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,350
I would never believe a girl as beautiful
could have such a great personality.

423
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:40,722
- Ugly-duckling syndrome.
- What?

424
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:45,959
She probably wasn't pretty till high school.
The personality developed out of necessity.

425
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:50,231
You know what? I bet you're right.
She's way too pretty to be so nice.

426
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:54,671
Sometimes they're ugly so long,
when they turn pretty, they don't realize it.

427
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:58,143
The ugly self-image is so well ingrained.
That's a real find.

428
00:35:58,212 --> 00:36:00,645
- Hey!
- Hey!

429
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,773
I've been looking for you.

430
00:36:02,885 --> 00:36:06,479
Oh, shit. Oh, it's Lindy. The girl with the toe.

431
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,358
- Hey.
- How ya doing?

432
00:36:09,426 --> 00:36:12,952
Good. Did you get my message?

433
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:17,398
No, no. My phone machine's
not really working there. Did you call?

434
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,493
- I got tickets for that Beatles reunion.
- The Beatles?

435
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:25,564
Yeah. Well, not the real Beatles,
but Paul, George and Ringo will be there.

436
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:30,342
But Eric Clapton is filling in for John.
It's an invitation-only acoustic set.

437
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:33,383
- Only about 70 people, tops.
- Oh, man.

438
00:36:33,452 --> 00:36:35,976
So you're in?

439
00:36:40,393 --> 00:36:42,622
No. Not a Clapton fan.

440
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,961
I think I'll pass.

441
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:50,666
OK. Well, I guess I'll see ya.

442
00:36:51,672 --> 00:36:53,764
- Yeah, yeah.
- Bye, Lindy.

443
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:59,368
- Did you see the toe?
- Mauricio, I gotta tell you, you got issues.

444
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:03,315
- Don't even get me started.
- Oh, my God. There she is.

445
00:37:03,384 --> 00:37:05,351
There's Rosemary.

446
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:09,380
- Where?
- Right there.

447
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:12,586
- Right where?
- Straight ahead. Across the field.

448
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:16,495
- Is she behind the rhino?
- She's right there!

449
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:26,039
Mauricio, I want you to meet someone.

450
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:30,239
This is Rosemary Shanahan.
Rosemary, Mauricio Wilson.

451
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,839
Hi. Nice to meet you.

452
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,113
Holy cow. I mean, uh... hi.

453
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:43,984
- Is that a Members Only jacket?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

454
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,364
So, what are you, like, the last member?

455
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,194
Oh, man.

456
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:52,566
One-nothing Rosemary.

457
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,370
Excuse me forjust one second. Hello?

458
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:59,410
Oh, hi, Mom. Yeah, hold on.

459
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,607
- Will you guys excuse me?
- Want something from the snack bar?

460
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:06,083
Yeah, get me a beer
and nachos with all the stuff on it.

461
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,212
You got it.

462
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:13,985
- Does she take the cake or what?
- She takes the whole bakery, Hal.

463
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:18,555
- I told you.
- Yes, you did. And yet I wasn't prepared.

464
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:24,163
- So, what are you up for?
- I don't know. I like the track.

465
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,141
Ah, so she's a gambler.

466
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,609
Yeah, well, just the dogs.

467
00:38:29,712 --> 00:38:34,115
I hate the ponies. There's too much
human involvement, you know?

468
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:37,949
You can't trust people
if you're looking for a fair deal.

469
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:43,317
- What about you? Do you gamble?
- No, not really.

470
00:38:43,394 --> 00:38:47,194
I bet on pro football now and then,
butjust to make the games more exciting.

471
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:50,531
- I don't really care if I win.
- Huh.

472
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:53,800
- I've never read that book.
- What book?

473
00:38:54,473 --> 00:38:57,340
Things Losers Say,

474
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:04,707
Hey, why don't we forget the track, and I'll
introduce you to some good friends of mine?

475
00:39:04,784 --> 00:39:06,341
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

476
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:08,113
- All right.
- What do you say?

477
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:11,021
- I say OK.
- You say OK?

478
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:18,691
Hi, guys. I want you to meet
a very good friend of mine. OK?

479
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:22,532
This guy here is Hal. And he's really funny.

480
00:39:22,604 --> 00:39:24,629
Hi.

481
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,798
How ya doing? Good to meet ya.

482
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:33,436
Hey. Wow. Oh, my God. Look at that face.

483
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:37,712
She should be doing Keebler commercials.
You're the cutest thing I've ever seen.

484
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:40,813
- What's your name, beautiful?
- Cadence.

485
00:39:40,924 --> 00:39:44,951
Cadence. That's a pretty name.
You know, my uncle's name is Cadence.

486
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,264
Well, I got news for you, Cadence.

487
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:55,667
I'm not putting you down
until the cows come home.

488
00:39:55,774 --> 00:39:58,833
Put her down.

489
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:01,039
The cow came home.

490
00:40:01,147 --> 00:40:04,604
What is he doing here?
These aren't visiting hours.

491
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:09,178
Oh, Nurse Peeler, we were just
coming by to say hi to the kids.

492
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:11,849
Fine. Pack it up.

493
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:15,686
And get these patients back in their beds.

494
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:25,898
- Should we get going?
- Don't pay any attention to Nurse Sourpuss.

495
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,066
Sourpuss.

496
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:33,470
Hey! I got an idea. Do you guys
wanna play the kissing game?

497
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,777
- Yeah?
- You want me to go get a bottle?

498
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:40,253
This is how we play. Wanna get the lipstick?

499
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:43,324
- Get lipstick.
- Yeah, OK.

500
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:46,657
What we do is, we put on the lipstick,

501
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,592
and then the kisser kisses as many times
as they can until the lipstick comes off.

502
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:54,864
Cool! I wanna go first.

503
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:57,838
- Then I'm going last.
- Jesse.

504
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:04,041
- Hey, they don't have anything I can catch?
- They don't have anything you can catch.

505
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:07,083
I didn't think so.
You guys don't even look sick.

506
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:10,051
You're just a bunch of phonies
like my Uncle Cadence.

507
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:13,750
I bet you're here just so you can
get out of school. Is that right?

508
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:16,761
- Yeah.
- Give me some of that lipstick.

509
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:21,631
You were incredible in there.
You were. You were so amazing.

510
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:25,502
I'm serious. A lot of people get
really squeamish in that situation...

511
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:29,268
- Rosemary? Is that you?
- Dr Sayed! How's it going?

512
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:32,311
- Good. Who's this?
- This is my friend Hal.

513
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:35,076
- Good to meet you.
- Be nice to her. She's a good girl.

514
00:41:35,182 --> 00:41:38,117
- All right.
- Bye, Rosemary.

515
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:40,186
That's what these kids need -

516
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:44,385
a stranger who isn't afraid to just
be with them and play with them.

517
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:49,796
- That's what builds their self-confidence.
- Why would anybody be afraid of 'em?

518
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:53,232
You are off-the-charts adorable.
Do you know that?

519
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,634
Come on.

520
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,041
- This is a nice street you live on.
- Yeah, this is my street.

521
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:05,343
- You wanna come up?
- Yeah. But I don't think I should.

522
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,814
Why not? It's only 9 o'clock.

523
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:13,346
- I know. I just don't think it's a good idea.
- Oh, no. Did I do something?

524
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:16,553
No. You've been really cool.

525
00:42:18,297 --> 00:42:20,561
- Hi, Hal.
- Oh, hey, Jill.

526
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:24,193
- Rosemary, this is my neighbor Jill.
- Hi. Nice...

527
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:29,375
- Sorry.
- Nice to meet you.

528
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:31,501
Nice to meet you too, Jill.

529
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:36,975
I gotta go and meet some friends,
so I'll see you guys later.

530
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,642
- Bye.
- Bye.

531
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,811
Come up.

532
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:43,588
- No.
- What?

533
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:46,888
I thought we were having a good time.

534
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:50,328
We were. It's just, you know,
Hal, I'm not used to all this.

535
00:42:50,432 --> 00:42:53,026
Used to what?

536
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:57,003
Hal, you've been really nice to me today.
I really appreciate it, but...

537
00:42:57,106 --> 00:43:00,007
What, your other boyfriends
aren't nice to you?

538
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:03,566
- I don't have other boyfriends.
- Bullshit.

539
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,545
Well, I had one boyfriend.

540
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,256
It was kind of recently,
actually, but it didn't work out.

541
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,850
- You've been burnt, huh?
- No.

542
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:24,063
That's just it. I've never been
close enough to anybody to get burnt.

543
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:29,231
Please! With a mug like that?
You must be fighting 'em off daily.

544
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:33,813
Right. I mean, I saw the way
your friend Mauricio looked at me.

545
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,475
I thought he was gonna shoot me
with a tranquilizer gun and tag my ear.

546
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:44,217
Don't worry. He's been acting really weird
lately, especially around really pretty girls.

547
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:50,629
Hal, do me a favor and stop saying
that I'm pretty and that I'm not fat, OK?

548
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,599
Cos it makes me uncomfortable.

549
00:43:53,668 --> 00:43:56,831
OK. You have a problem with compliments?

550
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:02,136
Look... I know what I am
and I know what I'm not.

551
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:08,273
I'm the girl who gets really good grades
and is not afraid to be funny.

552
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:12,945
And I'm the girl who has a lot of friends
who are boys, and no boyfriends.

553
00:44:13,023 --> 00:44:16,651
I'm not beautiful, OK? And I never will be.

554
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,694
And I'm fine with that. You know?

555
00:44:20,564 --> 00:44:24,694
But when you go around saying
that I'm something that I'm not,

556
00:44:24,802 --> 00:44:26,770
it's just... It's not nice.

557
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,432
Whoa, Rosemary.

558
00:44:29,507 --> 00:44:32,874
You're starting to scare me.
I mean, I really like you,

559
00:44:32,978 --> 00:44:38,575
but I have to assume you're a little nutty
if you really believe you're not beautiful.

560
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:40,642
Grow up, Hal.

561
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,211
Rosie. Wait a second.

562
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:55,059
Well, it was too good to be true.

563
00:44:56,837 --> 00:45:00,398
Rosemary. Turned out to be a total psycho.

564
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:04,676
Her self-image is so far off, it's scary.

565
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,875
Well, maybe you had a little
something to do with that.

566
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:13,545
What are you talking about? All I ever did
was tell her how perfect she was.

567
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:15,615
Really?

568
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:18,888
Yeah. Then she got all huffy
and told me to grow up.

569
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:24,254
Well, that's probably good advice.
You are kind of immature.

570
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:28,168
You're not serious. You actually
think you're more mature than me?

571
00:45:28,238 --> 00:45:35,236
You're right. I'm probably more immature
than you, but at least I have a bigger willie.

572
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:45,518
Yeah, bigger than a mouse's.

573
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,487
- What the hell was that?
- I said your willie's...

574
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:54,032
I heard what you said,
but it took you, like, eight seconds.

575
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:59,834
You can't come back with a comeback after
eight seconds. You got three. Five, tops.

576
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:03,274
That's why they call it a quip. Not a "slowp."

577
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:09,273
All right, you got anything better to read?
I gotta fire off a missile.

578
00:46:20,563 --> 00:46:22,258
Hi.

579
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,630
- Is this a bad time, or...?
- No.

580
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:31,668
I just wanted to apologize for last night.

581
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:35,211
- You don't have to apologize.
- Yeah, I do.

582
00:46:35,278 --> 00:46:40,238
I called you, like, immature or sophomoric
or something like that. I know you're not...

583
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,084
Oh, my God, Hal!
You gotta get in here and look at this turd!

584
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:46,520
It looks just like Klinger from M*A*S*H,

585
00:46:50,696 --> 00:46:53,426
- Why don't we get outta here?
- OK.

586
00:46:53,532 --> 00:46:55,624
Coffee?

587
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,245
Excuse me. Are you ready to order?

588
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:12,182
Yes. Two double cheeseburgers with bacon,
one with relish. Thank you.

589
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:19,658
- Are you OK?
- Brain freeze.

590
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:33,700
Excuse me, sweetie. Professional.

591
00:47:42,853 --> 00:47:45,617
Hey, Billy, stay over near the ladder.

592
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,486
Weak. So weak.

593
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:53,587
You wanna see a splash?
I'm gonna show you a splash. Ready?

594
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:19,958
- That was good?
- Billy?

595
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:23,889
Billy? Billy? Billy!

596
00:48:23,998 --> 00:48:26,193
Daddy!

597
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,728
Sorry.

598
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,582
- What's the matter?
- I should have changed at the beach.

599
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,789
What? Are you crazy? You look great.

600
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,697
I don't normally dress like this
around my parents.

601
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,134
Hey, hey, come on. I'm the one
who should be nervous here, not you.

602
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:09,211
Hey, you know, I've been meaning to ask you.
Were you adopted?

603
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,543
No. Why?

604
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,050
Cos your dad has that weird accent.

605
00:49:14,153 --> 00:49:19,250
And I've seen him around the office. I gotta
say, I don't see the slightest resemblance.

606
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,819
Really? Everybody says if you put
a wig on him, he'd lookjust like me.

607
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,000
Look at who's here now.
Come here, my darlin'.

608
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,866
Hi, Daddy.

609
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:33,667
- Rosie, honey.
- Mom.

610
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,833
Good to see ya.

611
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,572
This is Hal Larson,
the guy I was telling you about.

612
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,171
- Great to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

613
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:46,577
- Nice to meet you, Hal.
- The pleasure is mine, Mrs Shanahan.

614
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:50,421
Wow. I can see where
Rosemary gets her figure.

615
00:49:57,033 --> 00:50:00,663
What the hell... What the hell
is that you've got on?

616
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,707
We were at the beach.

617
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,836
Won't you be putting
something else on, darlin'?

618
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,714
Oh, come on. She doesn't have to
do that for me. Let's just keep it casual.

619
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:15,343
Casual.

620
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:21,526
Hey, Dad, Hal's one of your great
untapped resources down at the company.

621
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:27,121
- Why don't you tell him some of your ideas?
- Oh, so you've got a few ideas, do ya?

622
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,698
It is risky, but the rewards are greater, too.

623
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:35,868
Only a company with a solid reputation
like JPS could ever market this product.

624
00:50:39,313 --> 00:50:42,749
- Hal, let me take your plate.
- Thank you. It was delicious.

625
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:47,288
- Can I get you boys some coffee?
- I'd love a cup of tea, darlin'.

626
00:50:47,355 --> 00:50:50,483
Maybe just a drop of the hard stuff.

627
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:54,517
Yeah, I'll just have a cup of joe.
That'd be great. Thanks.

628
00:50:55,865 --> 00:51:00,198
I have to say, Hal,
I'm impressed with a lot of your ideas.

629
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:05,433
Some of them are dogshit, but for the most
part you seem to have done your homework.

630
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:08,000
- So I'd like you to do something for me.
- OK.

631
00:51:08,078 --> 00:51:12,276
I'm meeting with me executive committee
Monday morning,

632
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,876
and I'd like you to make a presentation.

633
00:51:15,953 --> 00:51:19,514
- Seriously?
- Well, nothing fancy, you understand.

634
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:23,320
Just talk about the same things
that you talked about here tonight.

635
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,225
Great. I'd love to.

636
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:30,030
Oh, and by the way,
you can cut out the act now.

637
00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:31,827
Excuse me?

638
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:36,365
You think I got as far as I did
in me life by bein' a fool?

639
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:39,467
Now, you've got ambition,
Hal, and I admire that.

640
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:42,640
Hell, I wish I had a hundred
more like yourself.

641
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:45,148
We'd be the number one firm in the country.

642
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:49,245
And me daughter would get
a hell of a lot more dates.

643
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:52,383
I'm sure Rosemary doesn't have
any problem getting dates.

644
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:55,520
I told you to cut the shit out, all right?

645
00:51:55,597 --> 00:52:00,556
Look, Rosemary's me daughter,
and God knows I love her dearly.

646
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:06,434
But I think we both know that we won't
soon be seeing her twirlin' the baton,

647
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:10,205
marching along with the Dallas cheerleaders.

648
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,155
I don't understand.

649
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,292
I'm telling the truth, Hal.

650
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,822
And the truth is I haven't been able to bounce
me daughter on me knee since she was two.

651
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:34,048
You know, I've read about people like you.

652
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:39,051
- People like me?
- Superachievers with impossible standards.

653
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:42,223
Nothing's ever good enough.
Nothing ever measures up.

654
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,929
It never occurs to you that your kids
are people, with their own feelings.

655
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:50,203
You think they're an extension of you,
like your company,

656
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:54,541
or your $20-million Learjet
and your Picasso out in the front hall.

657
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:59,050
Everything reflects on you, so nothing
and no one is ever good enough.

658
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,117
Go on.

659
00:53:02,188 --> 00:53:07,319
When I first met Rosemary, she told me
she knew she wasn't that good-looking.

660
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:11,922
I could not believe my ears.
I thought how can a person this beautiful

661
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:17,164
possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror
to be anything other than that?

662
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:19,365
Well, now I know.

663
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:28,211
Is everything OK?

664
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:31,582
Yeah, everything is fine. Just fine.

665
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,524
What?

666
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:45,633
Nothin'.

667
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:48,204
I just can't believe how lucky I am.

668
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,278
You swear to God you're not gonna laugh?

669
00:53:58,383 --> 00:54:01,147
Come on, I'm not gonna laugh.

670
00:54:10,363 --> 00:54:12,125
Daddy like.

671
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,400
What in the...? How did...?

672
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:55,543
Get over here, Houdini.

673
00:55:05,223 --> 00:55:07,019
Hi.

674
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:09,184
Yes, I am.

675
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:14,188
Everything's so perfect.

676
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:17,234
- It's a little scary.
- I know.

677
00:55:19,506 --> 00:55:21,633
But in a good way.

678
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:24,437
To have so much to lose. That's nice.

679
00:55:34,656 --> 00:55:37,318
- I'm gonna call you later.
- OK.

680
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:39,860
Bye.

681
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:55,801
Forget something?

682
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:57,472
Oh, hey.

683
00:55:57,581 --> 00:56:00,243
Hi. I'm glad I caught you
before you went to work.

684
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,544
What's up?

685
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,349
I was wondering if you wanted
to come over tonight,

686
00:56:04,422 --> 00:56:08,415
open a bottle of wine, maybe watch a video?

687
00:56:08,526 --> 00:56:10,118
Nah. Thanks, though.

688
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:21,498
And in summation, I feel that these measures
will help JPS and all of our customers.

689
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:31,607
- Nice job, Hal.
- Thank you.

690
00:56:31,718 --> 00:56:33,185
- Nicely done.
- I appreciate it.

691
00:56:33,253 --> 00:56:36,586
- Hal, I stand corrected.
- Thank you.

692
00:56:36,657 --> 00:56:40,354
Hal, I need to see you
in me office straight away.

693
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:42,328
Sure.

694
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,723
Sit yourself down.

695
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:50,132
So, what'd you think?

696
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:53,441
I'll be gettin' to that in a minute.

697
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:57,068
I want to talk to you about
that conversation we had the other night,

698
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,046
and all of them things you said to me.

699
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:06,183
Well, I'm more than just a little embarrassed,
having said what I said.

700
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,952
I think me daughter is lucky to have you.

701
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:12,789
No, sir. I'm the lucky one.

702
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,122
Indeed.

703
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:21,137
Well, now, as to your meeting in there,
sure, it was first-rate.

704
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:23,639
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes.

705
00:57:23,742 --> 00:57:26,768
Hal, I'm gonna level with you.

706
00:57:26,845 --> 00:57:29,836
- I need your balls.
- Sir?

707
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:33,646
I need a man around that can
give it to me straight, you know?

708
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:36,244
Whether the news be good or bad.

709
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:43,326
So I've decided - from now on,
you'll be working directly for me.

710
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:51,201
I don't know what to say, but thank you.

711
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:54,665
Well, a thank you will do just fine.

712
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:01,647
Well, get the fuck out.

713
00:58:01,684 --> 00:58:03,742
OK.

714
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:12,090
Congratulations on your promot...

715
00:58:12,162 --> 00:58:14,722
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no. Come in, come in.

716
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:21,169
I want you to meet Rosemary. Rosemary, this
is Jen and Artie. Kids, Rosemary Shanahan.

717
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:23,173
As in Steve?

718
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:27,735
Yeah, he's my dad. Oh, God, which
reminds me, I gotta meet him for lunch.

719
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:29,904
So I'll see you this weekend, OK?

720
00:58:34,253 --> 00:58:39,054
It was really nice to meet you guys.
Do you mind if I take a little sliver?

721
00:58:45,165 --> 00:58:47,395
Beauty.

722
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,559
Do you want a plate?

723
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:55,167
I know what you're thinking.
Where does she put it, right?

724
00:58:55,243 --> 00:58:59,043
You guys, thanks for the cake.
You didn't have to do this.

725
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:02,511
The least we could do,
seeing as how you worked so hard

726
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,678
to become "indispensable" to the company.

727
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:09,956
Is that that new thing called sarcasm?

728
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:15,621
Hal, we all know you're about as deep as a
puddle. That used to be part of your charm.

729
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:20,169
- But this just flat-out sucks.
- What are you talking about?

730
00:59:20,236 --> 00:59:25,299
If you have one ounce of integrity left,
you'll break it off immediately,

731
00:59:25,409 --> 00:59:28,104
before you hurt the poor girl.

732
00:59:36,154 --> 00:59:41,057
I gotta give you credit for being more
proactive and starting to meet women.

733
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,355
Who knows? Maybe you are on a roll here,

734
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:47,229
but don't you think it's time
to raise the bar a little?

735
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,598
I mean, at first I thought
you were in a slump, you know?

736
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,333
I could, as a friend, look the other way
while you banged a few fatties

737
00:59:54,408 --> 00:59:57,969
and got it out of your system,
but there's lots of good fish out there.

738
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:00,411
You don't have to snack on carp anymore.

739
01:00:00,481 --> 01:00:05,180
I suppose the girls we partied with a couple
weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp?

740
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:09,155
No. Laura, the one with the whiskers,
she looked more like a catfish.

741
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:12,352
Oh, I see. And what about Marie?

742
01:00:12,427 --> 01:00:16,055
Pop some bolts on her neck
and the villagers'll be chasing her.

743
01:00:16,165 --> 01:00:17,893
- And Vicki?
- Who?

744
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,557
- Vicki!
- Who's Vicki?

745
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:22,603
Vicki Vicki. With the short brown hair.

746
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:25,970
Vicki? I thought that was a guy.
I was calling her Vic!

747
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:31,001
- You're out of your mind!
- I know I'm being a little harsh on you here.

748
01:00:31,081 --> 01:00:34,847
I think real friends are obligated
to be honest with each other.

749
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:38,251
And this one that you're dating now -jeez.

750
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:40,488
Careful.

751
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:44,721
Hey, all I'm saying is
she's got cankles, for God's sake.

752
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,196
- What?
- Cankles! She's got no ankles.

753
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:51,134
It's like the calf merged with the foot,
cut out the middleman.

754
01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:54,467
I know what cankles are.
Rosemary doesn't have 'em.

755
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,668
You know what?
I know what you're doing here.

756
01:00:58,545 --> 01:01:01,309
- You're scared.
- Scared?

757
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:05,846
Yup. This is exactly what you did
with the knockout with the weird toe.

758
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:10,184
You're just inventing reasons
to dump girls cos you're afraid.

759
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:13,192
All right, look,
I admit Rosemary is kind of cool.

760
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,287
But you wouldn't even be talking
to that woolly mammoth

761
01:01:16,398 --> 01:01:19,959
if her father wasn't
the president of your company.

762
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:26,232
What?

763
01:01:33,783 --> 01:01:37,719
I guarantee you've never met anyone
like this guy. You're gonna love him.

764
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:41,621
- Great. What's his girlfriend like?
- I don't know. I haven't met her.

765
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:44,593
They just started going out. Oh, there he is.

766
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:46,822
Walt!

767
01:01:46,898 --> 01:01:49,389
At your cervix!

768
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,935
Hey, you recognize these panties?

769
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,867
Rosemary, don't steal my lines.

770
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:57,804
- You two know each other?
- Yeah!

771
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,471
Gosh, Walt's been volunteering
down at the hospital for years.

772
01:02:02,749 --> 01:02:04,978
So where's this mystery girl?

773
01:02:05,752 --> 01:02:08,220
She should be here any minute.

774
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:12,854
Hey...

775
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:17,590
I want you to be honest.
Is this outfit too "Hey, look at me"?

776
01:02:17,665 --> 01:02:21,601
No, no. It's very subtle.

777
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:33,176
- Sorry I'm late.
- Tanya.

778
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:37,247
Oh. What a surprise.

779
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,070
- I gotta get a map.
- I'm going with you.

780
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:00,940
What are those for?

781
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:05,983
You ever walked through a truck-stop
men's room on your hands?

782
01:03:09,088 --> 01:03:11,818
- Want anything?
- Potato chips. And dip.

783
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:17,352
Cut it out.

784
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:23,298
So, Tanya, I had no idea that you and Walt
were, you know, seeing each other.

785
01:03:23,403 --> 01:03:25,462
Yeah. You got a light?

786
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:40,215
It's actually a very funny story. Because he
had been asking me out for a really long time

787
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,883
and I was always kind of unavailable.

788
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:47,986
And then just when he had given up, I broke
up with my boyfriend, and there he was.

789
01:03:48,063 --> 01:03:50,395
So I asked him out.

790
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:53,027
So he kind of grew on you, huh?

791
01:03:53,103 --> 01:03:56,903
Exactly. I mean, you gotta admit,

792
01:03:57,006 --> 01:04:00,066
when you first meet him, it is kind ofjarring.

793
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:03,738
I mean, you kinda don't even know
what goes where.

794
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:07,181
But, anyway, the timing
couldn't have been more perfect,

795
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:12,280
because he had just sold his company,
and he has all this time on his hands,

796
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:15,018
and we can plan things

797
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:17,995
and travel and go shopping and...

798
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:22,861
Well, I guess timing's everything.

799
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,766
Hope you like bean dip.

800
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:09,877
Yeah! That was my girl.

801
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:12,477
Oh, my God. I'm the biggest nerd.

802
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:16,182
- Rosemary!
- Ralph!

803
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:19,353
Hi.

804
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,898
You remember Li'iBoy?

805
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,433
Li'iBoy. Yeah. How are you?

806
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,104
- Mahalo, Rosemary.
- How you doing?

807
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:29,639
- Great.
- Wow.

808
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:34,372
- They still got you out in Sierra Leone?
- No, no. Now they got me nearer my home.

809
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:37,439
I'm on this island
in the South Pacific called Carabas.

810
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:40,680
- I'm Hal.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hal.

811
01:05:41,721 --> 01:05:46,920
These are my Peace Corps buddies. This is
Ralph Owens and Li'iBoy. This is Hal Larson.

812
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,619
- What's up?
- Li'iBoy.

813
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,493
So, what are you guys doing up here?

814
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:57,469
Li'iBoy's been stuck in the office
training for 30 days,

815
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,031
so I dragged him here
and threw him on the slopes.

816
01:06:00,108 --> 01:06:02,338
It wasn't pretty.

817
01:06:02,979 --> 01:06:06,779
I knew this Hawaiian guy in high school
who went out for the hockey team.

818
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:09,374
It was funny as shit.

819
01:06:13,824 --> 01:06:17,658
Anyway, it's great to see you again.

820
01:06:19,197 --> 01:06:22,188
You look happy.

821
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:25,696
Thanks. I am.

822
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:31,869
Well, we got a long drive back, so...

823
01:06:33,411 --> 01:06:35,038
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
01:06:35,114 --> 01:06:37,206
Good to meet ya.

825
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:43,888
- You OK?
- Uh-huh.

826
01:06:45,492 --> 01:06:50,451
It's just that... Do you remember
how I told you that once I had a boyfriend?

827
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:52,828
That was him.

828
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,241
You're welcome.

829
01:07:03,344 --> 01:07:05,403
What's your name?

830
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:09,773
Excuse me, Mr Robbins.
Could I have a word with you, sir?

831
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:12,877
- Sure, but I gotta catch a plane.
- It'll only take a minute.

832
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:16,685
A few weeks ago, you got trapped
in an elevator with a friend of mine.

833
01:07:16,793 --> 01:07:21,355
Hal! He was a great guy. He was having
trouble with his relationships. How is he?

834
01:07:21,432 --> 01:07:25,266
- Well, that's a matter of debate.
- Really?

835
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:28,497
Anyway, apparently,
you gave him, like, a pep talk,

836
01:07:28,606 --> 01:07:33,066
and now he's under the impression
that he can get any woman he wants.

837
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:36,578
- And you don't think he can?
- I don't know. Whatever.

838
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:42,645
But, see, the point is,
lately the only women he wants are ugly.

839
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:46,416
- Who says they're ugly?
- Bausch & Lomb.

840
01:07:46,492 --> 01:07:51,294
And very fat, some of them.
It's like Hal has lowered his whole...

841
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:54,059
Jesus, you've got a big noggin.

842
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:57,330
Thanks for noticing.
My new book has a chapter on blurting.

843
01:07:57,471 --> 01:08:00,599
- You might wanna pick it up.
- Yeah, I'll check into that.

844
01:08:00,674 --> 01:08:03,541
Anyway, I mean,
did something go wrong here?

845
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:06,011
Or is my friend having a nervous breakdown?

846
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,072
No. Haven't you ever heard the phrase
"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"?

847
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:14,176
Yeah. Did you ever hear the song
"Who Let The Dogs Out"?

848
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:18,887
- It can't be that bad.
- Look, exactly what did you do to him, man?

849
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,292
I altered his perception a little bit.

850
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,429
I knew it. I knew it! I knew it!

851
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,031
- You messed with his eyesight, right?
- No.

852
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,972
- You hypnotized him.
- No. I dehypnotized him.

853
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:35,500
He's been hypnotized his whole life,
totally focused on the outside.

854
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,103
I helped him to see
the inner beauty in everyone,

855
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,183
including people you think
are not physically attractive.

856
01:08:41,253 --> 01:08:45,519
How can he see their inner beauty
when he doesn't even know them?

857
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:48,650
Inner beauty's easy to see
when you're looking for it.

858
01:08:48,727 --> 01:08:52,322
But how can he not feel them when he's...?

859
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:57,667
The brain sees what the heart wants it to feel.

860
01:08:57,737 --> 01:09:01,264
All right, look. Let's just
cut through the old crapcake here!

861
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,366
OK.

862
01:09:05,179 --> 01:09:11,481
Sir, don't you think
it's wrong to brainwash someone?

863
01:09:11,585 --> 01:09:13,746
Don't you think you're brainwashed?

864
01:09:13,822 --> 01:09:17,757
Everything you know about beauty
is programmed. TV, magazines, movies.

865
01:09:17,826 --> 01:09:22,286
They're all telling you what's beautiful
and what isn't. How's this any different?

866
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,161
Look, I didn't come here to debate you!
I just want my friend back!

867
01:09:26,235 --> 01:09:32,106
Now, isn't there some kind of word or phrase
or something to take the whammy off him?!

868
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:37,008
Of course. But if we do that, he'll go back
to judging everybody by the outside.

869
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:40,879
- Is this what he really wants?
- I don't care what he wants!

870
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:43,782
It's what I want! I want my friend back!

871
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:47,055
I gotta go. I gotta catch my plane.
I'm really sorry.

872
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:51,823
Look, a man's reputation, dignity
and furniture are being trashed here!

873
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:57,027
Perhaps irreparably!
For God's sakes, his job is in jeopardy!

874
01:09:57,102 --> 01:10:00,435
- His job? Really?
- Yes. And it's a greatjob.

875
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:07,435
I just wanted to give him a gift.
I didn't want him to get hurt.

876
01:10:07,514 --> 01:10:10,209
You seem to know him better than I do, so...

877
01:10:10,316 --> 01:10:14,343
- It's a shame to let it go.
- Oh, it's a tragedy.

878
01:10:15,656 --> 01:10:18,750
So, what did you wanna talk to me about?

879
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:27,523
- Ralph called me.
- Your old boyfriend Ralph?

880
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:31,162
Well, he was also my division leader
in Sierra Leone.

881
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:37,836
Anyway, he's shipping out to Carabas in ten
days and he wants me to go with his group.

882
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:41,350
What? You and Ralph? Carabas?

883
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:44,078
They're in the middle
of this economic meltdown.

884
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:49,353
100,000 women and children need medical
supplies and food, and they want me to help.

885
01:10:49,493 --> 01:10:52,087
How can you be so selfish?

886
01:10:52,162 --> 01:10:53,390
Sorry?

887
01:10:53,497 --> 01:10:57,365
I mean, you know what I'm sayin'.
You bump into pretty-boy Ralph on Friday,

888
01:10:57,468 --> 01:11:02,269
the sparks are flying, and now you're
gonna go and save the world in Carabas?

889
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:05,935
- This has nothing to do with me and Ralph.
- Yeah, right.

890
01:11:06,078 --> 01:11:08,444
He's obviously crazy about you.

891
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,744
He's got the heart of a saint.

892
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:15,288
I could practically see the halo
around his head. I can't compete with that.

893
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,017
OK, first of all, you're probably
the only person in the Free World

894
01:11:19,092 --> 01:11:21,424
to ever refer to Ralph as a "pretty-boy."

895
01:11:21,495 --> 01:11:25,158
Secondly, that halo around his head,
it's called psoriasis.

896
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:28,428
You can't stand within three feet
without getting flaked on.

897
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:32,267
And thirdly, and fourthly, yes,
he's a great guy and he cares about me,

898
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,332
but he had no sense of humor.

899
01:11:35,443 --> 01:11:38,345
And I'm in love with an even greater guy.

900
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:43,310
Well, then how come I don't have
any say in this thing?

901
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,477
You do. That's why...

902
01:11:48,591 --> 01:11:50,683
God, are you OK?

903
01:11:52,495 --> 01:11:56,727
- Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
- You should be sorry! This is an outrage!

904
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,597
- I'll go get help.
- Are you OK, sweetie?

905
01:11:59,703 --> 01:12:00,964
Thank you very much.

906
01:12:01,071 --> 01:12:03,096
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

907
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:07,838
It's this flimsy-ass four-star restaurant.

908
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:11,075
Just sit right here.
I'm gonna go talk to the manager, OK?

909
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:13,241
I'll be right back.

910
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,447
Good night. Thank you.

911
01:12:18,724 --> 01:12:24,094
I'm not blaming you, but I need a chair. My
girlfriend's jinxed when it comes to furniture.

912
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:26,755
I'm so sorry.
The waiter told me what happened.

913
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:29,498
Just a sec. Mclntosh's.

914
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:34,095
Hello?

915
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:37,142
- Shallow Hal wants a gal,
- What?

916
01:12:37,244 --> 01:12:39,838
Shallow Hal wants a gal.

917
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:44,283
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I just saved your life, baby.

918
01:12:44,352 --> 01:12:46,912
- What?
- I've been looking for you all day.

919
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:50,048
I'm at Mclntosh's with Rosemary.
Look, I got kind of a...

920
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:53,457
- Are you looking right at her?
- No, I'm talking to the hostess.

921
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:55,154
Hal, don't! Hal...

922
01:12:55,264 --> 01:12:58,894
- Look, I got a situation here. I'll call you later.
- Look away!

923
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:05,868
- I was just talking to the hostess.
- Right. That would be me.

924
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:08,343
No, no. It was the other hostess.

925
01:13:08,445 --> 01:13:11,414
Sir, I'm the only hostess in the restaurant.

926
01:13:12,516 --> 01:13:15,952
Let me apologize about the booth.
We are so sorry.

927
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:21,651
We've replaced your date's side with a new
chair, a strong one, and the meal's on us.

928
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:25,164
Oh, OK. Well, thank you.

929
01:13:25,264 --> 01:13:27,891
You're welcome.

930
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:45,043
Excuse me. Did you move us?

931
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:47,883
No. Second table on the right.

932
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,653
Well, then maybe you can explain to me
why that robust woman

933
01:13:53,728 --> 01:13:55,592
is eating my girlfriend's din...

934
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,530
Hey! Now she's eating my clams casino!

935
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,998
Sweetie, are you OK?

936
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:05,267
Excuse me.

937
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,433
Mclntosh's. Tiffany.

938
01:14:07,877 --> 01:14:09,936
OK.

939
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,170
We're two friends walking. We're just walking.

940
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:39,039
And then Robbins confirmed
exactly what I thought.

941
01:14:39,112 --> 01:14:42,639
- Which is?
- You weren't irresistible to women.

942
01:14:42,715 --> 01:14:46,174
He hypnotized you so that
really ugly girls that you met from then on

943
01:14:46,286 --> 01:14:49,050
- would, to you, look like supermodels.
- What?

944
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:53,560
If they had inner beauty or some baloney.
You could get any woman you desired

945
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:57,120
because you were suddenly
desiring the undesirable.

946
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,497
- You get it?
- No, not exactly.

947
01:15:00,602 --> 01:15:06,006
Let me put it this way. It's like
he gave you beer-goggle laser surgery.

948
01:15:06,075 --> 01:15:08,737
Now wait a second. So what you're saying

949
01:15:08,844 --> 01:15:13,282
is that all the pretty girls I've met lately
are not really pretty?

950
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:16,044
All right. Let's look at the facts.

951
01:15:16,152 --> 01:15:19,417
They were funny, smart and nice.

952
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:25,325
Pretty girls are not funny!
And they're certainly not nice. Not to us.

953
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:29,490
When I found out what Robbins was doing,
I convinced him to take the trance away.

954
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:35,472
When I said "Shallow Hal wants a gal,"
you were cured.

955
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,340
You're out of your mind. Do you know that?
I'm going back to the restaurant.

956
01:15:39,445 --> 01:15:42,642
- Hal. Hal, come on.
- Hey, Hal!

957
01:15:44,317 --> 01:15:47,945
You never called me back.
What happened to you?

958
01:15:48,053 --> 01:15:51,580
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

959
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:53,783
I've got my hair back.

960
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:55,987
It's me - Katrina.

961
01:15:57,531 --> 01:15:59,726
We shared the cab together.

962
01:16:01,168 --> 01:16:05,867
I'm in town taking care of my grandma,
Cos she's been sick, and...

963
01:16:07,242 --> 01:16:10,143
Oh, wait a minute! I get it!

964
01:16:11,246 --> 01:16:14,340
Nice try, Mauricio. Where'd you find this one?

965
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,210
No, it's me - Katrina.

966
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:24,090
From Boston. The magical fruit?

967
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,960
Yes, I remember Katrina.
But the thing is, you're not Ka...

968
01:16:32,136 --> 01:16:34,661
I never told you about K...

969
01:16:36,106 --> 01:16:39,974
Katrina! How the heck are ya?
Give me some sugar.

970
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:44,841
I didn't recognize you. The hair and the...

971
01:16:47,052 --> 01:16:52,389
You screwed me, man! I had a beautiful,
caring, funny, intelligent woman,

972
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:54,924
and you made her disappear!

973
01:16:54,994 --> 01:17:01,661
Oh, no, I didn't. I just made Rosemary appear.
There's a difference. It's called reality.

974
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:07,866
Hey, if you can see something and hear it
and smell it, what keeps it from being real?

975
01:17:07,942 --> 01:17:10,205
Third-party perspective.

976
01:17:10,278 --> 01:17:12,872
Other people agreeing that it's real.

977
01:17:13,748 --> 01:17:18,446
OK, let me ask you a question.
Who's the all-time love of your life?

978
01:17:20,088 --> 01:17:21,680
Wonder Woman.

979
01:17:21,757 --> 01:17:25,453
OK. Let's say Wonder Woman
falls in love with you, right?

980
01:17:25,527 --> 01:17:29,293
Would it bother you if the rest of the world
didn't find her attractive?

981
01:17:29,365 --> 01:17:31,731
Not at all. Cos I know they'd be wrong.

982
01:17:31,835 --> 01:17:35,362
That's what I had with Rosemary!

983
01:17:35,472 --> 01:17:39,306
I saw a knockout!
I don't care what anybody else saw!

984
01:17:39,376 --> 01:17:42,573
Jeez, I never thought about it that way.

985
01:17:45,182 --> 01:17:51,382
- Hey, I guess I really did screw you, huh?
- What am I gonna do?

986
01:17:51,523 --> 01:17:55,515
Hey, hey, don't panic.
We just get Tony Robbins back here,

987
01:17:55,594 --> 01:17:58,756
he puts the Vulcan mind-meld on ya
and he puts you back under.

988
01:17:58,864 --> 01:17:59,761
Good idea.

989
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:02,856
- In the meantime you just avoid Rosemary.
- Why?

990
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:07,837
Because if you see the real Rosemary,
hypnosis is not gonna help you.

991
01:18:07,908 --> 01:18:10,899
You'll need the jaws of life
to get that image out of your head.

992
01:18:18,952 --> 01:18:20,943
Hal, open up. It's me.

993
01:18:26,695 --> 01:18:28,754
I hear you in there.

994
01:18:30,432 --> 01:18:32,524
Just a sec, Rosemary.

995
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:42,068
What happened to you at the restaurant?

996
01:18:42,144 --> 01:18:45,581
I got something in my eye.
I had to run back here and flush it out.

997
01:18:45,682 --> 01:18:49,173
Yeah, the hostess said
that you seemed a little cuckoo.

998
01:18:49,286 --> 01:18:52,152
- So, come on, open up.
- I can't.

999
01:18:53,156 --> 01:18:55,090
- Let her in. We'll club her.
- No.

1000
01:18:55,158 --> 01:18:57,126
I'm...

1001
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,322
I'm very sick.

1002
01:18:59,398 --> 01:19:01,764
I've got, uh...

1003
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:04,496
- CC!
- You have what?

1004
01:19:06,038 --> 01:19:08,506
Contagious conjunctivitis.

1005
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:12,739
I'll take my chances. Now open up.

1006
01:19:14,614 --> 01:19:16,672
All right. In a minute.

1007
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,159
I told you it was nasty.

1008
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:36,067
Are you OK? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

1009
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,266
Nah, nah. I got some drops. I'll be fine.

1010
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:44,305
- My poor baby.
- Yeah.

1011
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:47,974
Well, I should probably rack out.
This has taken a lot out of me.

1012
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:50,142
OK.

1013
01:19:51,555 --> 01:19:54,683
Well, I'll call you in the morning
and see how you're doing.

1014
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:57,453
Great, great. Bye-bye.

1015
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:33,592
Hal, is everything all right with you?

1016
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:37,492
Yeah. Yeah, it's topnotch, sir.

1017
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,204
Why?

1018
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:43,368
Well, it's just that Rosemary's been telling me

1019
01:20:43,444 --> 01:20:49,008
that she's having a bit of trouble getting you
on the telephone the last couple of days.

1020
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:52,644
Now, I wouldn't be working you
too hard, would I?

1021
01:20:53,523 --> 01:20:56,514
No. I mean, I'm working hard,

1022
01:20:56,593 --> 01:21:00,221
but I guess I've just been
a little preoccupied with things.

1023
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:04,528
But I'll make sure and touch base with her.

1024
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:08,195
Right. Right.

1025
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:11,365
OK, then.

1026
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:21,909
I'm sorry. Apparently Tony Robbins is a lot
tougher to track down than I thought he'd be.

1027
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:25,286
- I'll come through. I promise.
- I can't keep this up, man.

1028
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:28,122
Calm down.

1029
01:21:28,194 --> 01:21:32,221
I don't know, Mauricio.
Maybe I should just see her.

1030
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:35,923
I mean, I do have,

1031
01:21:38,038 --> 01:21:40,233
you know, the heart thing.

1032
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:43,776
Maybe that's enough
to overcome her appearance.

1033
01:21:43,845 --> 01:21:46,438
It could be like in that movie -
The Crying Game,

1034
01:21:46,548 --> 01:21:49,039
When the guy fell in love
with a beautiful woman?

1035
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:53,644
And then when he found out it was a guy,
it didn't matter, cos he already loved her.

1036
01:21:53,756 --> 01:21:59,159
Hal, if a set of hairy boys was
your biggest hurdle here, I'd say go for it.

1037
01:22:10,608 --> 01:22:13,270
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me,

1038
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,674
Hey, what's up, Rosemary?

1039
01:22:15,745 --> 01:22:18,714
- What happened yesterday?
- Hm?

1040
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:22,719
Well, I stopped by your office to say hi,
but you just took off running.

1041
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,680
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No,

1042
01:22:25,756 --> 01:22:29,487
- What were you doing?
- I was jogging,

1043
01:22:29,561 --> 01:22:34,589
- In your business suit?
- I had a sweat suit underneath.

1044
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:40,998
Is everything...?

1045
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:43,905
What's going on, Hal?

1046
01:22:43,978 --> 01:22:46,378
Things haven't felt the same lately.

1047
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:48,971
- No?
- No.

1048
01:22:50,718 --> 01:22:53,619
Hey, Rosemary, don't worry. Everything...

1049
01:22:54,955 --> 01:22:58,857
I'm just in a little funk right now,
and everything's gonna be fine.

1050
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:04,357
Yeah. So...

1051
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:06,935
I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow?

1052
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:08,565
Bye.

1053
01:23:10,306 --> 01:23:12,398
Bye.

1054
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:55,186
- Who is it?
- Hal, is that you? It's Jill.

1055
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:57,348
Comin'.

1056
01:23:58,526 --> 01:24:00,118
Hey, what's up?

1057
01:24:00,194 --> 01:24:03,493
Hey. My girlfriend just bailed on me,

1058
01:24:03,564 --> 01:24:07,398
and I was wondering if I could
take you out to dinner.

1059
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,935
I'm sorry. Tonight's not good.

1060
01:24:10,005 --> 01:24:13,940
Don't be such a stiff.
There's some stuff I wanna talk to you about.

1061
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:17,968
- No, really, I can't.
- Please? We'll go outjust as friends.

1062
01:24:19,182 --> 01:24:21,877
Oh, come on. You gotta eat, don't you?

1063
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:27,421
- Can I ask you something, Jill?
- Yeah.

1064
01:24:28,124 --> 01:24:30,820
Why the sudden thaw?

1065
01:24:31,396 --> 01:24:34,887
Well, I've been thinking a lot.

1066
01:24:36,735 --> 01:24:42,731
Hal, I made a mistake. I never
should have broken it off with you.

1067
01:24:42,807 --> 01:24:46,573
Well, you didn't really break it off.
We only had that one date.

1068
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:51,309
Besides, you did the right thing. We didn't
have anything in common, remember?

1069
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:54,944
But that was my fault.
I shut you out emotionally.

1070
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:58,456
We could have had more things
in common if I'd wanted to.

1071
01:24:59,258 --> 01:25:02,091
- Mr Shanahan, how are you this evening?
- How am I?

1072
01:25:02,162 --> 01:25:05,928
Tonight I feel like a thorn
amongst a bed of roses.

1073
01:25:05,999 --> 01:25:09,935
- Your table's ready. John'll seat you.
- Right this way, please.

1074
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:14,600
- I'm just gonna go to the ladies' room.
- OK, Rosie. We'll be at the table.

1075
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:40,400
Yeah. See, why did you shut me out
in the first place? I'm just curious.

1076
01:25:40,504 --> 01:25:45,373
Well, frankly,
I guess I thought you were shallow.

1077
01:25:47,578 --> 01:25:48,545
Me?

1078
01:25:48,613 --> 01:25:54,574
Yeah. You struck me as this
kind of superficial dickwad.

1079
01:25:54,654 --> 01:25:57,748
I don't know. What do you call it?

1080
01:25:58,457 --> 01:26:00,357
Hal, it's OK.

1081
01:26:00,426 --> 01:26:05,090
I've been watching you in the past few weeks.
I've seen the women you've been out with.

1082
01:26:05,164 --> 01:26:11,262
And now I know appearances
mean absolutely nothing to you.

1083
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:15,206
If anything, you're pathologically unshallow.

1084
01:26:16,477 --> 01:26:18,740
- I don't know about that.
- It's true.

1085
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:22,607
Listen, I have an idea.

1086
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:26,481
Why don't we get all this food to go?

1087
01:26:26,554 --> 01:26:31,514
- Why?
- Because it'll taste a lot better in bed.

1088
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:43,705
You know, there are
a few times in a guy's life -

1089
01:26:43,773 --> 01:26:46,901
and I mean two or three, tops -

1090
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,343
when he comes to a crossroads,
and he's gotta decide.

1091
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:55,579
If he goes one way, he can continue what he's
doing and be with any girl who will have him,

1092
01:26:55,653 --> 01:26:59,783
and if he goes the other way,
he gets to be with only one woman,

1093
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:01,950
maybe for the rest of his life.

1094
01:27:02,728 --> 01:27:06,493
It seems like by taking the second road,
he's missing out on a lot.

1095
01:27:06,565 --> 01:27:09,864
But the truth is, he gets much more in return.

1096
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:12,699
He gets to be happy.
Are you wearing panties?

1097
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:16,264
God! What am I saying? No!

1098
01:27:16,776 --> 01:27:22,806
No, I'm sorry. Jill, this isn't gonna happen. I...

1099
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,813
I think I'm gonna go down
that other road for once.

1100
01:27:39,402 --> 01:27:41,494
- Hi.
- Hello.

1101
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:07,361
Hello?

1102
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:11,258
Hey, hey, hey now. It's me, your love bunny.

1103
01:28:11,337 --> 01:28:14,931
I miss you and I wanna see you,

1104
01:28:15,007 --> 01:28:18,340
What's the matter? You sound upset,

1105
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:21,140
What are you, some kind of psycho?

1106
01:28:25,885 --> 01:28:27,943
Hello? Rosie?

1107
01:28:36,764 --> 01:28:38,925
Just you leave me daughter alone.

1108
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:43,526
- I don't understand.
- The jig is up, and she knows it.

1109
01:28:43,605 --> 01:28:47,041
Well, she hasn't returned my calls.
What's going on?

1110
01:28:47,175 --> 01:28:51,406
It's a little late to be worrying
about that now, don't you think?

1111
01:28:51,514 --> 01:28:55,746
Besides, she went and accepted
that Peace Corps assignment.

1112
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:02,283
No offense, but I think
I have a right to hear this from her.

1113
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:04,259
I'll give you your rights.

1114
01:29:04,328 --> 01:29:08,162
I'll give you your last rites,
you self-righteous little shit!

1115
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:12,993
You know, I wanted to like you. I truly did.

1116
01:29:13,104 --> 01:29:18,542
And all of that malarkey that you gave me
that night at the house. I bought into it.

1117
01:29:18,944 --> 01:29:23,107
In spite of all me better instincts,
I took the hook.

1118
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:28,885
I don't know.
Maybe I share in the blame of it all.

1119
01:29:28,955 --> 01:29:34,086
Maybe I just wanted to believe
that there was still a decent guy out there.

1120
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,822
A lad that would be right for me daughter.

1121
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:40,491
- But, sir...
- Don't speak. Just you listen!

1122
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:46,301
Now, thankfully, as it turns out,
there is a guy out there.

1123
01:29:46,374 --> 01:29:50,812
- His name is Ralph Owens.
- Ral... Pretty-boy Ralph?

1124
01:29:50,912 --> 01:29:54,143
Don't be a smart ass. Now you listen to me.

1125
01:29:54,216 --> 01:29:58,846
They're back together,
and me daughter has a chance to be happy.

1126
01:29:58,954 --> 01:30:02,185
And you, you'll be respectin' that.

1127
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:30,082
Excuse me. Could you tell me what floor
Rosemary Shanahan works on?

1128
01:30:30,189 --> 01:30:32,555
I think she's up in Pediatrics.

1129
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:35,355
- Yeah. That's third floor.
- Thank you.

1130
01:30:45,238 --> 01:30:47,103
Hal, is that you?

1131
01:30:47,207 --> 01:30:49,505
Hey.

1132
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:52,078
- What are you doing here?
- I...

1133
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:56,780
I came to see Rosemary.

1134
01:30:57,919 --> 01:31:01,184
Well, she left early.
She seemed upset about something.

1135
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:05,955
- Any idea where she went?
- You got me.

1136
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:09,255
Hi, Hal.

1137
01:31:11,234 --> 01:31:13,326
Hi.

1138
01:31:15,438 --> 01:31:19,203
- How do you know my name?
- It's me - Cadence.

1139
01:31:36,828 --> 01:31:38,886
Oh, hi, Cadence.

1140
01:31:44,203 --> 01:31:45,795
How are you, beautiful?

1141
01:31:45,872 --> 01:31:48,807
How come you haven't come back to see us?

1142
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:55,872
Well, me and Rosemary have been
having some problems.

1143
01:31:58,052 --> 01:32:01,215
- I was really stupid.
- Oh.

1144
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:05,622
Well, why don't you go buy her a present
and then maybe you can make up?

1145
01:32:44,069 --> 01:32:46,161
You were right.

1146
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:54,177
In the gym last week when you said
I was scared of women, you were right.

1147
01:32:56,850 --> 01:33:01,981
- Nah, I didn't mean that. I was just...
- No, come on, Hal. It's the truth.

1148
01:33:03,556 --> 01:33:05,820
I'm terrified of 'em.

1149
01:33:05,925 --> 01:33:10,659
I haven't been close to a woman
my whole life.

1150
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:18,030
I'm a coward, all right?

1151
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:32,183
But why? I mean, look at you.
You're a mountain of a man.

1152
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:38,888
You got more style than Mr Blackwell.
You're pulling in what - 28, 29 Gs a year?

1153
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:41,897
- 29,500.
- You're the perfect catch!

1154
01:33:41,999 --> 01:33:44,900
I know, I know. It's crazy.

1155
01:33:45,837 --> 01:33:49,169
I just have this thing.

1156
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,632
What thing?

1157
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:57,910
It's kind of a birth defect thing.

1158
01:33:59,085 --> 01:34:01,918
Jeez, man. I didn't know.

1159
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:04,422
- What is it?
- I have a tail.

1160
01:34:07,794 --> 01:34:10,660
- A tail.
- What do you mean, like a story?

1161
01:34:10,764 --> 01:34:13,858
No, a tail. It's like a waggy tail.

1162
01:34:14,969 --> 01:34:17,631
My backbone is longer
than it's supposed to be.

1163
01:34:17,738 --> 01:34:22,005
It's like a genetic abnormality.
It's a vestigial tail.

1164
01:34:22,077 --> 01:34:25,274
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

1165
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,937
Get out!

1166
01:34:27,014 --> 01:34:31,951
If I can't even get my best friend to accept it,
how am I supposed to expect a woman to?

1167
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:36,287
Wait a second. Are you for real?
Cos if you are, I gotta see this.

1168
01:34:36,392 --> 01:34:40,556
- No, you don't wanna see it.
- No, I don't wanna. I gotta.

1169
01:34:53,177 --> 01:34:57,044
- Good Lord!
- All right, you believe me now?

1170
01:34:57,983 --> 01:35:00,042
Oh, man. It really does wag.

1171
01:35:00,619 --> 01:35:03,645
Only when I'm nervous, or happy.

1172
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:07,750
Wow.

1173
01:35:09,961 --> 01:35:14,261
Have you ever thought about,
you know, maybe getting it cut off?

1174
01:35:14,367 --> 01:35:19,134
Cut off? I don't know
why I never thought of that

1175
01:35:19,206 --> 01:35:24,007
when I was getting pummeled in gym class
by a bunch of barking seniors!

1176
01:35:25,612 --> 01:35:28,775
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- God!

1177
01:35:31,886 --> 01:35:36,289
The damn thing is wrapped around an artery!
No doctor will touch it!

1178
01:35:36,392 --> 01:35:40,692
Well, it's not so bad.

1179
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:45,998
I guarantee you there are some girls
who would think it was adorable.

1180
01:35:46,069 --> 01:35:48,832
Like a little puppy dog.

1181
01:35:48,904 --> 01:35:52,636
Really? You think it's like a puppy dog?

1182
01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:54,801
It's cute as a button.

1183
01:35:57,181 --> 01:36:00,672
- Do you wanna pet the little fella?
- No!

1184
01:36:01,419 --> 01:36:04,252
But, you know, I'm not much of a dog person.

1185
01:36:08,527 --> 01:36:12,519
By the way, you're gonna need
a little sod on the fairway there.

1186
01:36:12,598 --> 01:36:15,123
Huh? What do you mean?

1187
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:19,163
So, what are you doing right now?

1188
01:36:20,139 --> 01:36:23,940
- Nothing. Why?
- Can I get a lift? I gotta go see someone.

1189
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:25,672
Yeah. Sure.

1190
01:36:25,778 --> 01:36:28,679
Seems like longer than forever, yeah

1191
01:36:28,781 --> 01:36:31,807
My home is now a distant land

1192
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:35,822
If I had one wish, I wish you could be

1193
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:38,791
Back on that rock in the middle of the sea

1194
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:42,660
My heart is calling me to the islands

1195
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:45,823
My home is now a distant land

1196
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:49,701
If I had one wish, I wish I could be

1197
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,204
Back on that rock

1198
01:36:52,642 --> 01:36:55,610
Hey! Hal, right?

1199
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:59,710
- Have we met?
- It's me, Li'iBoy.

1200
01:37:01,884 --> 01:37:04,944
I met you up in the mountains with Ralph.

1201
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:09,721
- Oh, yeah, Li'iBoy. How ya doing?
- Yeah.

1202
01:37:09,794 --> 01:37:13,422
- You look like you been working out.
- Nah.

1203
01:37:13,932 --> 01:37:16,559
So, do you know if Ralph is in the office?

1204
01:37:17,136 --> 01:37:19,036
Yeah. Ralph!

1205
01:37:22,174 --> 01:37:25,040
Hal! Hey, Hal.

1206
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:28,672
Hey. How ya doin'?

1207
01:37:28,782 --> 01:37:33,378
I'm doing great. You're looking good.
So, what can I do you for?

1208
01:37:35,623 --> 01:37:39,582
- I came here to congratulate you.
- On...?

1209
01:37:40,161 --> 01:37:42,220
Look,

1210
01:37:43,097 --> 01:37:46,224
you got a great girl, and you deserve her.

1211
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:53,565
More than me. And the truth is,
I'm happy for Rosemary.

1212
01:37:54,443 --> 01:37:58,846
But I want you to understand one thing.
You better be good to her, Ralph.

1213
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:02,907
Ralph, if you ever mess up
and make her unhappy,

1214
01:38:02,986 --> 01:38:06,922
I'll be waiting in the wings,
and I'll pounce on you. Like a tiger!

1215
01:38:07,024 --> 01:38:11,927
Like a tiger on a deer,
with a cloven hoof and with a broken arm!

1216
01:38:11,996 --> 01:38:14,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hal.
What are you talking about?

1217
01:38:14,866 --> 01:38:17,356
You're back together. Let's not play games.

1218
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,767
- Rosemary and I aren't back together.
- You're not?

1219
01:38:21,773 --> 01:38:27,369
Let's put it this way. Her parents are throwing
a going-away party for her as we speak.

1220
01:38:27,445 --> 01:38:29,970
I wasn't even invited.

1221
01:38:47,435 --> 01:38:50,232
- This seems crazy.
- Yeah. That's cos it is.

1222
01:38:50,303 --> 01:38:53,238
- But crazy's all you got.
- Amen to that.

1223
01:38:56,078 --> 01:38:58,170
Good luck, Hal.

1224
01:39:12,362 --> 01:39:17,459
Well, I could use a drink. What do you say
we slide around the side here?

1225
01:39:17,567 --> 01:39:20,035
Yeah, we'll blend in.

1226
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,603
Yeah.

1227
01:39:25,409 --> 01:39:27,468
Hello?

1228
01:39:31,817 --> 01:39:33,944
- Rosie?
- Excuse me. What are you...?

1229
01:39:36,088 --> 01:39:40,047
I love you. I'm not going anywhere
until you hear me out.

1230
01:39:56,376 --> 01:39:58,468
What are you doing?

1231
01:40:01,281 --> 01:40:04,045
- Who are you?
- Who am...?

1232
01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:07,782
Hal, are you drunk? It's me, Mrs Shanahan.

1233
01:40:09,124 --> 01:40:13,322
I have some things to say to your daughter.
I'm not leaving here until I do.

1234
01:40:13,429 --> 01:40:18,491
OK. But could you release Helga
so she can get back to work?

1235
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:38,922
Get ready, Li'iBoy. It's showtime.

1236
01:40:43,127 --> 01:40:46,255
Well, Hal, now's your chance.

1237
01:41:18,401 --> 01:41:20,800
What are you doing here?

1238
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:24,635
Oh, my God. You're beautiful.

1239
01:41:26,142 --> 01:41:29,236
You have no right to be here.

1240
01:41:31,315 --> 01:41:34,614
- Hal, come on. This isn't working out.
- I'm OK.

1241
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:37,209
What the hell are you doing here?

1242
01:41:39,656 --> 01:41:43,057
- I'm having a word with your daughter.
- It better be "goodbye"!

1243
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:45,823
- You've got her all up...
- Steve! Shut up.

1244
01:41:52,705 --> 01:41:55,639
Rosemary, I am so sorry that I hurt you.

1245
01:41:56,641 --> 01:41:59,474
I've been really dumb.

1246
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:03,675
I'm immature, I'm unthoughtful,
I'm a friggin' idiot.

1247
01:42:07,053 --> 01:42:11,854
But I love you.
You're the only girl I've ever loved.

1248
01:42:14,227 --> 01:42:18,891
And I just didn't want you to go away
without knowing that.

1249
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:29,740
You really hurt me.

1250
01:42:29,846 --> 01:42:36,683
I know. But if you'll let me, I wanna spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

1251
01:42:42,058 --> 01:42:44,322
Well, your timing is terrible.

1252
01:42:44,427 --> 01:42:49,422
I mean, I'm leaving for Carabas
tonight for 14 months.

1253
01:42:53,437 --> 01:42:56,929
I'm sorry, Rosemary.
I just can't wait that long.

1254
01:42:59,344 --> 01:43:01,437
I understand.

1255
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:06,116
Which is why I'm going with you.

1256
01:43:11,325 --> 01:43:13,485
What?

1257
01:43:13,593 --> 01:43:19,054
It's true, Rosie. Big Kahuna here just swore
him into the Corps about a half-hour ago.

1258
01:43:19,132 --> 01:43:21,224
That's right. He's official.

1259
01:43:24,405 --> 01:43:26,805
Are you sure that's what you wanna do?

1260
01:43:29,477 --> 01:43:32,241
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

1261
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,756
- Here's your bag, Rosemary.
- Thank you.

1262
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:48,261
- Congratulations, Hal.
- Thank you.

1263
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:49,762
- Rosemary.
- Bye.

1264
01:44:49,865 --> 01:44:54,234
Just keep it right there at the airport.
I'll pick it up later. Congrats.

1265
01:44:54,303 --> 01:44:56,828
- We love you, Rosie.
- I love you, Mom.

1266
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:01,636
And, Rosemary, you'd better
be looking after me lad.

1267
01:45:01,711 --> 01:45:03,701
I will.

1268
01:45:05,616 --> 01:45:07,015
Later, dudes!

1269
01:45:18,263 --> 01:45:20,823
Say bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1270
01:45:28,407 --> 01:45:31,467
You like puppy dogs, do ya?

1271
01:45:31,544 --> 01:45:34,068
Anything to do with dogs, I melt.

1272
01:45:36,349 --> 01:45:39,546
Why don't we go around back,
get a little drink?

1273
01:45:39,653 --> 01:45:42,121
- Sure.
- Yeah? Come on, big fella.

1274
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:26,996
Hey, kid. How 'bout these Rossi boots?
Do they fit like a glove or what?

1275
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,060
