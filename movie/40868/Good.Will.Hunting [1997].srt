1
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,413
Mod f x square dx.

2
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,137
So please finish Percival
by next time.

3
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,014
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,732
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,777
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,460
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,219
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,457
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,219
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,139
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,969
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,537
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,060
Well, that's all.

14
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,298
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,220
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

16
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:58,535
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,936
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

18
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,289
- No.
- Why not?

19
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,219
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:08,571
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:12,296
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

22
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:16,130
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:19,458
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:21,413
Toot-Toots!

25
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,499
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:27,500
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

27
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:30,135
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,174
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:35,656
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

30
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:40,059
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

31
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,297
I'm tired.

32
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,293
Irish curse?

33
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:49,175
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

34
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:56,579
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

35
00:06:56,702 --> 00:07:00,695
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

36
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,773
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

37
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:08,497
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

38
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:13,059
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

39
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,173
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,136
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

41
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,496
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

42
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:26,220
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

43
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,536
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

44
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:36,052
I'd hold you forever here

45
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:39,618
In my arms

46
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,255
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:07:41,383 --> 00:07:45,058
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,811
Come here. It's Saturday!

49
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:51,331
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.

50
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:54,341
Maybe. We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

51
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,977
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

52
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:22,771
This is correct.
Who did this?

53
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,018
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

54
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,660
- Nemesh?
- No way.

55
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:34,217
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

56
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,618
Come on, kid!

57
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:38,893
- Joey, dig it out of there. Dig it out!
- I love the pitch!

58
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:42,298
Lay it down, Mac. That's how to do it!
Attaboy! Take two, Mac, take two!

59
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,858
- Nice hit.
- Taylor, you're up.

60
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,531
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

61
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,461
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

62
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,893
Lt's that fuckin' guinea. I hate
that little bitch. Will knows him.

63
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:58,298
- You know him?
- Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

64
00:08:58,423 --> 00:09:00,334
That kid used to beat the shit out of me
in kindergarten.

65
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:02,134
- That guy?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,019
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

67
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,180
Oh, what, Morgan,
you're not gonna go talk to her?

68
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:09,577
Fuck her.

69
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:12,217
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,221
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:19,575
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

72
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:22,814
Double burger.

73
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:27,254
Double burger?

74
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,492
Chuck I had a double burger

75
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,217
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

76
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:36,221
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

77
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,982
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

78
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:41,857
I said I'd get change when I get the snow
cone. I said that before when we pulled up.

79
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:44,099
Why don't you just gimme my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick?

80
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:48,615
All right, well, give me your fuckin' 16 cents that you
got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.

81
00:09:48,743 --> 00:09:52,452
Here we go. Keep it right up here
for ya. We'll put you on a programme.

82
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,735
Every day you come in with your six cents.
At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.

83
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:59,412
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

84
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,261
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

85
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,534
Like how you bought your couch:
Payment plans.

86
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:07,302
Remember how your mother brought
in ten dollars every day for a year?

87
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:09,095
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

88
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:12,375
- Can I have my food now, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

89
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,378
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

90
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:18,698
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

91
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,291
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

92
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:24,540
- Yeah, you, you skank face!
- Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:27,497
- Let's get outta here. - What are
you worried about? - Come on, Will.

94
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:29,215
Why don't you lick my love stick?

95
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:32,620
We just seen the guy 15 minutes ago at the park.
If we was gonna fight him, we should fight him then.

96
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,463
- We got snacks now.
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.

97
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,653
- I'm not goin'. - So
don't go. - I am not goin'!

98
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:40,093
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

99
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,375
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not out there in
two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them, you're next.

100
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:48,383
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.
Remember? We went to kindergarten together.

101
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:52,702
Way down the street
there's a light in his place

102
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:55,258
He opens the door
He's got that look on his face

103
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:05,420
- Fuckin', let's go, man!
- Step on his fuckin' head.

104
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:09,332
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

105
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:17,337
Motherfucker, die!

106
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:19,898
- Carter!
- Come on!

107
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:34,934
Will! Will, come on! Come on.

108
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:38,299
Will, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

109
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:42,934
- Easy, brother, easy.
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

110
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,861
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

111
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:53,337
Fuck!

112
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:04,463
Ls this just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

113
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:09,778
Well, by no stretch of my imagination do I
believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

114
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:14,694
Or rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

115
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:19,420
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

116
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:33,581
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

117
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:36,378
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

118
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,976
However, um, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

119
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:43,017
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

120
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:45,181
that took us more than two years
to prove.

121
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:49,653
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

122
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:53,664
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour.

123
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,776
- Hi.
- When's the arraignment?

124
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:09,702
Next week.

125
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:39,664
- Sorry. - What are
you doing? - Sorry.

126
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,060
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

127
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:44,825
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

128
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:47,778
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

129
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,138
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:19,583
Looks right.

131
00:14:34,266 --> 00:14:37,177
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

132
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,774
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around the room?

133
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:42,260
Mitch, you got fired from pushin'
a fuckin' broom.

134
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:44,058
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

135
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:47,019
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

136
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:49,137
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

137
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:52,497
- At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now, don't I?
- Yeah.

138
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,983
- Why did you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Uh, management was restructuring.

139
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,860
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

140
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:05,059
- You kiddin' me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
- And I told you "no" yesterday.

141
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,619
- What's up, Case? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

142
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:13,463
Let's sit over here.

143
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,858
Oh, this is,
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

144
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:25,420
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the walls.

145
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,935
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

146
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:41,585
Time-out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

147
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:45,062
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

148
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:02,785
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

149
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:04,737
- Hi, how are ya?
- Fine.

150
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,822
- So, do you ladies, uh...
- Come here often?

151
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:11,737
Do I come here? I come here a bit. I'm
here, uh, uh, you know, from time to time.

152
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:14,016
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

153
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:17,856
- Yeah. That's it. Yes, I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah?

154
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,217
- What class?
- History.

155
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:23,145
- Maybe.
- Yes, I think that's what it was.

156
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:26,623
You don't necessarily... May not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

157
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,863
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius.

158
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,215
- I am very smart.
- Hey.

159
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:32,463
- Hey! How's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

160
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:35,021
- You wanna...
- What, uh... What class did you, did you say that was?

161
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:36,944
- History.
- History. Yeah.

162
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:40,423
Just history? Lt must've been
a survey course then, huh?

163
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,026
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

164
00:16:42,147 --> 00:16:44,707
You should check it out. It's
a good course. It'd be a good class.

165
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,226
How'd you like that course?

166
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:51,023
You know, frankly, I found the class,
you know, rather, uh, elementary.

167
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,138
Elementary. You know,
I don't doubt that it was.

168
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:56,384
- Yeah.
- I, uh, I remember that class.

169
00:16:56,507 --> 00:17:00,102
It was, um, it was
just between recess and lunch.

170
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,616
Clark, why don't you go away?

171
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,738
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go just away?

172
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:06,664
I'm just having fun with my new friend.
That's all.

173
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,620
- What, we gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no, no, no. There's no problem here.

174
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:13,501
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

175
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:16,744
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

176
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,497
My contention is that, uh,
prior to the Revolutionary War...

177
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:24,700
the economic modalities,
especially in the southern colonies...

178
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,341
could most aptly be characterized as...

179
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:29,185
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you something. All right?

180
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,458
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

181
00:17:31,588 --> 00:17:34,624
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian, Pete Garrison, probably.

182
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,501
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

183
00:17:37,628 --> 00:17:40,745
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

184
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,540
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740.

185
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,023
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

186
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:50,026
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

187
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:54,265
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

188
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:58,222
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

189
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:01,897
"Wood drastically, Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

190
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:04,940
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth"?

191
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:09,061
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

192
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,576
Yeah, I read that, too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

193
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,223
Do you have any thoughts, uh,
of your own on this matter?

194
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:16,861
Or do you... Is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

195
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:21,266
You read some obscure passage and then
pretend... You, You pawn it off as your own...

196
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:25,939
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

197
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:29,538
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

198
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,942
And you're gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life.

199
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,628
One: Don't do that.

200
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:37,387
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

201
00:18:37,508 --> 00:18:40,544
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

202
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,983
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

203
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:48,862
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

204
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,227
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

205
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,744
But I mean, if you have a problem with that, I mean,
we could just step outside. We could figure it out.

206
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:02,901
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

207
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:05,178
- It's cool?
- Yeah. - Cool.

208
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:07,617
- Fuckin' damn right, it's cool.
- How do you like me now?

209
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,737
My boy's wicked smart.

210
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:17,981
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place, and run into a barney, huh?

211
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:21,742
Well, there it is.
Hello, nice to meet ya.

212
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,701
They were fine, man. I was gonna...
We was gonna close the deal...

213
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:27,980
but then Chuck, uh,
Billy insulted one of 'em...

214
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:31,545
and the heavyset girl said that I even had a
receding hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

215
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:33,818
And I was like, "Go fuck yourself. "

216
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:37,184
I swallowed a bug.

217
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,747
Hi.

218
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,463
- You're an idiot.
- What?

219
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:46,787
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for
45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me.

220
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:49,058
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

221
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,748
And I, I couldn't sit there any more
waiting for you.

222
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,746
- Wh... I'm Will.
- Skylar.

223
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,426
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

224
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:58,858
that guy over there,
Michael Bolton clone...

225
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,866
he wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

226
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,785
Yeah, I know.
I kinda got that impression.

227
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,946
Good. Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

228
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,857
Gotta get up early and waste some
more money on my overpriced education.

229
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,423
- No, I didn't mean you. I...
- Ah, that's all right.

230
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:15,700
There's my number. So maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

231
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:19,708
All right, yeah. May-Maybe we can just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

232
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:23,423
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

233
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:26,063
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

234
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:29,067
- Uh, right, then.
- Come on.

235
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,588
- Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, fuck you the same.

236
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,145
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with their skiin' trip.
- Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,305
I should've beat that old bitch's ass.

238
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,500
Do you like apples?

239
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,860
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

240
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,586
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

241
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:10,305
We arrived tonight

242
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,944
The miles were over me

243
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:21,537
I turned off the light

244
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,343
So, come on, night

245
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:33,147
Everyone is gone

246
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,701
Home to oblivion

247
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:45,667
So come on

248
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,829
So come on by

249
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,387
Tom.

250
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,179
Excuse me. Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

251
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,426
Yeah. What can I do for you?

252
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:05,427
I just need the name of a student
who works here.

253
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,825
- No students work for me.
- Well, could you please check?

254
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,986
I have this guy who works
in my building. He's about this high.

255
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,669
- Which one is your building?
- Two.

256
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,860
Two. Building two.

257
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:23,100
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

258
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,062
I just need his name.

259
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,943
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

260
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,107
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

261
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,698
Tom, please.

262
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,747
This is important. Please.

263
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,624
Willy didn't show up for work today.

264
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,742
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

265
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,705
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

266
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,228
Thank you.

267
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,268
Asshole.

268
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,385
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honour, going back to 1789...

269
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,627
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

270
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,869
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny, a defence of liberty.

271
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,142
Your Honour, Henry Ward Beecher, in Proverbs from
the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, and I quote...

272
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,545
- 1887? This is the 20th century, Your Honour.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

273
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,342
- He's gonna make a mockery of the courtroom.
- I am afforded the right...

274
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:24,350
to speak in my own defence, sir, by
the Constitution of the United States.

275
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,190
- This is the same document which guarantees my liberty.
- Don't tell me about the Constitution of the United States.

276
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,666
And liberty, in case you've forgotten,
is a souI's right to breathe.

277
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,145
And when it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

278
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,465
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

279
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:37,549
- Ibid., Your Honour.
- Son, my turn.

280
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:42,142
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

281
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,979
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

282
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:48,102
September '93, assault.

283
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,587
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

284
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,749
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

285
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,023
"free property rights of horse
and carriage" from 1798.

286
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:03,348
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

287
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:07,259
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

288
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:10,827
I'm also aware that you've
been through several foster homes.

289
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:14,944
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

290
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,030
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

291
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:23,269
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

292
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:25,825
- Thank you.
- Court, rise.

293
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:30,301
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

294
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:32,501
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

295
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,144
- Who?
- It's Will.

296
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,183
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

297
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,701
I don't recall meeting anyone who matched
that description. I think I'd remember.

298
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:43,868
Oh, all right, you got me. It's
the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

299
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:46,027
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

300
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,029
Oh, Will! I remember.

301
00:24:50,152 --> 00:24:53,268
- How are you? I-I was wondering
if you'd call me. - Yeah, look.

302
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,029
- I was wondering...
- Yo, so, baby. What's up?

303
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:56,743
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing?

304
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,180
- Hey!
- What's up, baby? Want some of my ass?

305
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:02,781
- Herve! I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What's up, baby? What you doing?

306
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,028
Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um...

307
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,745
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together, um, sometime this week.

308
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,101
You know, sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.

309
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:12,426
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
- Yeah?

310
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,348
Yeah. Sure. Where are you?

311
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,145
Um, well, actually, this is, uh,
this is just a shot in the dark...

312
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:21,423
but, uh, there's no chance that you're,
uh, pre-law, is there?

313
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,384
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

314
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:30,343
Nice talking to ya.

315
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,742
What the fuck do you want?

316
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:36,430
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

317
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,060
The professor you told
to fuck himself.

318
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:44,389
Well, what the fuck do you want?

319
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:48,425
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

320
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,462
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:58,301
- But under two conditions.
- What are those?

322
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,821
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

323
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:04,342
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

324
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:08,862
get into some, some more advanced...

325
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:11,904
combinatorial mathematics...

326
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:13,830
finite math.

327
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:17,668
Sounds like a real hoot.

328
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:23,503
And the second condition is that,
that you see a therapist.

329
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:31,343
And I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

330
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:34,351
And if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions...

331
00:26:34,472 --> 00:26:36,269
you will have to serve time.

332
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:40,590
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

333
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:44,387
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

334
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:49,466
I read your book, and, uh, and, and
"Mike" was havin' the same problems...

335
00:27:49,593 --> 00:27:51,788
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

336
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:54,746
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

337
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,386
Thank you.

338
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:59,585
Will, the pressures,
and I'm not judging them...

339
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:02,273
I'm not, uh, labelling them...

340
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:05,225
but they are destroying
your potential.

341
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:10,143
Now no more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

342
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,946
You're right.

343
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:14,870
God, I know.

344
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:18,627
You know, you're not gonna get off
that easily. Come on, Will, a bit more.

345
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,390
Well, I mean, I do, I do do things,
you know? I mean...

346
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:22,868
What, uh, what kind of things?

347
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,065
I do things that, you know, I, uh... You
know, I mean, I hide from, from people.

348
00:28:26,193 --> 00:28:30,789
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I mean, I like... I, I go places. I interact, you know.

349
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:33,347
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

350
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,429
More. That's nice, yes.
What sort of clubs?

351
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:38,431
- Like, um, like Fantasy.
- Fantasy?

352
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,351
- It's not bad.
- Bit more.

353
00:28:40,473 --> 00:28:44,705
It's just something like when you get
in there and, the music like owns you.

354
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:47,267
It's like that house music.
It's like...

355
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:54,784
- You know, you start dancin'. It's just...
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

356
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,631
- Yes.
- Yeah.

357
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,388
Do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you're gay?

358
00:29:02,513 --> 00:29:05,347
What are you... What are you...
What are you talking about? What?

359
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:07,907
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

360
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:11,105
A jump? Are you...

361
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,304
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
But...

362
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:16,028
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

363
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,782
What are you... P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

364
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:24,907
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

365
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:26,989
It's very erotic.

366
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:29,673
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

367
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:32,865
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

368
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:34,393
Ah, Henry.

369
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:37,665
Hi, Gerry. Hey, you know something?
I can't do this pro bono work any more.

370
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:39,590
It's just not... It's not worth it.

371
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:42,181
- What happened?
- Well, I'm going on national television next week.

372
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,988
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving loony in there.

373
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,707
An absolute lunatic, he is.

374
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,824
Henry.

375
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,832
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

376
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:57,503
Now, how old are you?

377
00:29:58,594 --> 00:30:00,391
Seven.

378
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:02,903
What do you see?

379
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:06,304
Something's in my room.

380
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:09,267
What is it?

381
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:13,946
Lt's like a, uh... It's a figure.
It's, it's hoverin' over me.

382
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:17,464
You are in a safe place, Will.

383
00:30:17,594 --> 00:30:21,030
It's t... It's touching me.

384
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,621
Where is it touching you?

385
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:26,392
Lt's touching me down there.

386
00:30:27,714 --> 00:30:29,831
And, uh, I'm nervous.

387
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:33,503
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

388
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:37,309
We start dancin' and dancin'.

389
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:41,143
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

390
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:45,506
A lot of love before the sun goes down

391
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:50,229
Skyrockets in flight

392
00:30:50,355 --> 00:30:52,915
Afternoon delight

393
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:56,470
- Hey, hey afternoon delight
- Jesus.

394
00:30:56,594 --> 00:30:59,745
Skyrockets in flight

395
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:03,150
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

396
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:06,153
Hey, hey afternoon delight

397
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:09,745
Come on, one dance! You, you really
hypnotized me, you know.

398
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:11,786
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on.

399
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:13,825
I... He left.
You can't pin that on me.

400
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,468
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

401
00:31:16,595 --> 00:31:19,314
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

402
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:23,746
- I don't need therapy.
- That's enough! Get out!

403
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:26,992
I called Mel Weintraub this morning
to see...

404
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,503
Oh, what's the use?

405
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,704
What do you want to do?

406
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,865
- Well, there is someone.
- Who is he?

407
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,953
He used to be my, um...

408
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:43,270
my roommate in college.

409
00:31:46,715 --> 00:31:50,230
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

410
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,425
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

411
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:55,115
Why is trust
the most important thing...

412
00:31:55,235 --> 00:31:57,510
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

413
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:03,953
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

414
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:05,872
Vinnie?

415
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:10,227
Um, because, uh...

416
00:32:10,354 --> 00:32:13,348
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.

417
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,911
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

418
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,434
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

419
00:32:18,554 --> 00:32:22,912
You know, if a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then he won't be honest with you.

420
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,912
Then there's really no point for them
being in therapy.

421
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:27,913
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you know,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

422
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:29,832
And that should be the goal
of any good therapist.

423
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:31,946
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
That's my motto.

424
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:36,187
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

425
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:41,144
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

426
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:47,752
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

427
00:32:47,876 --> 00:32:51,948
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

428
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,748
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

429
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,515
Lt's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

430
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:00,992
Except they only give it out
once every four years.

431
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:03,913
It's, it's a great thing.
It's an amazing honour.

432
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:05,946
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
Thanks. Um...

433
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:08,749
We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

434
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,551
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

435
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,314
How are you?

436
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:17,869
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

437
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,144
- Sean?
- Yeah?

438
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,915
I think I got
something interesting for ya?

439
00:33:22,036 --> 00:33:24,390
What? You have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

440
00:33:24,515 --> 00:33:29,874
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Time. You know, I'm... I've been busy.

441
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:31,873
- You were missed.
- Really?

442
00:33:31,996 --> 00:33:34,987
So, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

443
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:38,313
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

444
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:40,744
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

445
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,514
I got your card.
It was nice.

446
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:49,393
- Come here.
- Now, that's a good takedown.

447
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:53,225
Hey, uh, what happened?
Did you, uh, get leniency or what?

448
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:57,951
I got, uh, probation and then, uh,
counselling two days a week.

449
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:01,385
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

450
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:05,550
Hey, Bill, just, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

451
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,553
- I've got a full schedule.
- Sean, Sean. - I'm very busy.

452
00:34:07,676 --> 00:34:10,509
This, this boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

453
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:13,594
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

454
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:17,789
- Ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

455
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:22,353
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was, uh, Indian.

456
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:25,070
- Dots not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

457
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,152
Well, he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

458
00:34:27,277 --> 00:34:29,426
He had no formal education.

459
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:31,990
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

460
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:34,108
- You, sir? - Just
a little. - And, um...

461
00:34:34,236 --> 00:34:36,431
But he came across
this old math book.

462
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:39,117
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

463
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:41,068
that had baffled mathematicians
for years.

464
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:44,108
Yes. Continued fractions.
Yeah, he, he wrote, uh...

465
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:47,945
- Well, he, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah. Cambridge. Yeah.

466
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:51,149
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

467
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,632
and brought him over to England, and
then they worked together for years...

468
00:34:54,756 --> 00:34:57,395
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done.

469
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:59,667
Uh, This, this Ramanugan...

470
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,676
his, his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

471
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:06,913
Well, this boy's just like that.

472
00:35:07,037 --> 00:35:10,427
But he's, um, he's a bit defensive.

473
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:13,469
And I need someone
who can get through to him.

474
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:16,111
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

475
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,830
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

476
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:22,074
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighbourhood.

477
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:24,665
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

478
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,947
Boy genius from Southie.

479
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:32,196
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

480
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,869
- Let me guess. Barry?
- Yeah.

481
00:35:34,996 --> 00:35:36,429
- Henry? -
Yeah. - Not Rick?

482
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:39,468
Sean, please,
just meet with him once a week.

483
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,428
Please?

484
00:35:44,397 --> 00:35:47,469
Lt's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

485
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,350
He's probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

486
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:52,707
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

487
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:54,270
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

488
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:56,274
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

489
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,706
How are ya?

490
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:04,274
- Yeah, let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

491
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:06,353
I'm pumped!
Let's let the healing begin.

492
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:09,833
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

493
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:14,314
- You, too, Gerry.
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:21,871
How are you?

495
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:25,232
Where are you from in Southie?

496
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,190
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

497
00:36:28,317 --> 00:36:31,469
Do you buy all these books retail,
or do you send away for like...

498
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:34,510
a shrink kit that comes
with all these volumes included?

499
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:37,993
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

500
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:40,551
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

501
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,952
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

502
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:46,706
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

503
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:50,307
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

504
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:53,236
Hey, I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

505
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:54,996
I did. I had to.

506
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:58,746
- It must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

507
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:09,314
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

508
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,589
Jesus.

509
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:24,869
If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

510
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:26,795
That book will fuckin' knock you
on your ass.

511
00:37:26,918 --> 00:37:28,749
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

512
00:37:28,877 --> 00:37:32,426
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

513
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,395
You spend all your money
on these fuckin' fancy books.

514
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,032
You surround yourselves with 'em.
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

515
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:41,867
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
- Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

516
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,592
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

517
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:48,506
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

518
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:52,597
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:55,312
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:57,349
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:58,991
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

522
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:00,836
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

523
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,153
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,468
You paint that?

525
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,874
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

526
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,750
- No.
- Do you like art?

527
00:38:15,238 --> 00:38:17,069
Do you like music?

528
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:19,154
This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:21,075
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

530
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,395
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

531
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:26,669
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:30,427
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

533
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,355
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,992
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:38:35,118 --> 00:38:37,428
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,470
Lt's paint-by-number.

537
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,953
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

538
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,591
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

539
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:46,517
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,629
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:52,354
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

542
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,230
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,156
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

544
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:58,598
In what way?

545
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,870
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

546
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:04,876
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:07,115
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:08,830
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

549
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,154
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:13,509
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

551
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:17,075
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,954
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,869
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

554
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,156
Ah.

555
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:37,154
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

556
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:39,429
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:45,071
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

558
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,394
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

559
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,675
Lf you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:54,755
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:56,597
Got that, chief?

562
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,354
- Time's up.
- Yeah.

563
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,917
At ease, gentlemen.

564
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,636
You okay?

565
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:33,428
Look, I'll, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

566
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,108
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

567
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,474
Yeah.

568
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,431
Thanks.

569
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,916
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

570
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,712
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

571
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,796
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

572
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,716
Wonderful.

573
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,152
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

574
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,593
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

575
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,759
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

576
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,394
You know, I figured out,
at the end...

577
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:15,117
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

578
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,390
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

579
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,077
Bring me another mai tai!

580
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,958
No, that's cool, I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

581
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:29,039
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

582
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,392
Wow. Well, is, uh,
is Harvard gettin' all that money?

583
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,273
No. Stanford. I'm going there in June
when I graduate.

584
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:39,439
All right, so you just wanted to, to use
this sailor and then, uh, run away, huh?

585
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:43,440
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

586
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,438
Oh, in that case, that's fine.

587
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,357
Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks,
Skylar?

588
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,836
- Of course.
- All right. Promise...

589
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:53,791
All right.

590
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,470
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait, you need my wand.

591
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,114
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

592
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,152
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

593
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,920
You ready? Ready.

594
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,474
One, two, three.

595
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,919
They're all gone. Yeah. That, that was...
It works better when I have my rabbit.

596
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,794
Well...

597
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:18,276
I don't really date, you know,
that much.

598
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:21,552
How very unfortunate, I think for me.

599
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:26,234
You know what I mean.
I know you've been thinking about uh...

600
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,032
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:31,119
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have! You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

602
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,315
No, you know, I tell ya.
I was hoping to get good-night laid.

603
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:38,751
But I'll settle for like a good kiss,
you know.

604
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:42,191
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

605
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:45,153
No, I was, I was hopin' for a kiss.

606
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:49,558
Well, I think we should just get it
out of the way now.

607
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,028
- Right now?
- Yeah.

608
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:54,957
Come on.

609
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:05,555
I think I got some of your pickle.

610
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:18,279
You again, huh?

611
00:44:19,602 --> 00:44:21,035
Come with me.

612
00:44:28,241 --> 00:44:32,871
So what's this? A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

613
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:36,119
This is really nice.
You got a thing for swans?

614
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:39,631
Ls this like a fetish? Ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to?

615
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:45,401
I thought about what you said to me
the other day. About my painting.

616
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:46,671
Oh.

617
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,316
Stayed up half the night
thinkin' about it.

618
00:44:50,602 --> 00:44:52,718
Something occurred to me.

619
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:57,120
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

620
00:44:57,242 --> 00:45:00,075
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

621
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:04,161
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

622
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:07,638
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

623
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:09,992
You've never been out of Boston.

624
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,720
Nope.

625
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:18,631
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written.

626
00:45:18,762 --> 00:45:22,471
Michelangelo.
You know a lot about him.

627
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:25,833
Life's work. Political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

628
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:30,240
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

629
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:34,435
I bet you can't tell me what
it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

630
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:40,440
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

631
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,556
Seen that.

632
00:45:45,682 --> 00:45:47,479
If I ask you about women...

633
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:51,038
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

634
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:53,551
You may have even been laid
a few times.

635
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:02,159
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

636
00:46:02,282 --> 00:46:04,512
and feel truly happy.

637
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:09,399
You're a tough kid.

638
00:46:11,123 --> 00:46:14,558
I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh,
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

639
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:17,833
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

640
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:22,276
But you've never been near one.

641
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:25,042
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

642
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,996
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin' to you for help.

643
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:34,512
I ask you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

644
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:40,280
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

645
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:44,316
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

646
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:48,755
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth
just for you...

647
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:51,477
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

648
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,754
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

649
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:57,794
to have that love for her
be there forever.

650
00:46:57,923 --> 00:47:02,201
Through anything. Through cancer.

651
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:06,201
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand...

652
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:08,153
because the doctors could see
in your eyes...

653
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,275
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

654
00:47:13,003 --> 00:47:15,039
You don't know about real loss...

655
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:18,678
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

656
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:23,318
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

657
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:30,913
I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

658
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:36,275
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

659
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:41,120
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

660
00:47:41,243 --> 00:47:44,679
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

661
00:47:44,803 --> 00:47:47,636
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

662
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:50,323
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

663
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,040
You're an orphan, right?

664
00:48:00,283 --> 00:48:03,719
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

665
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:06,310
how you feel, who you are...

666
00:48:06,444 --> 00:48:09,594
because I read Oliver Twist?

667
00:48:09,724 --> 00:48:12,032
Does that encapsulate you?

668
00:48:14,163 --> 00:48:16,597
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that.

669
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:21,673
Because you know what? I can't learn anything
from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

670
00:48:23,243 --> 00:48:27,237
Unless you want to talk about you,
who you are.

671
00:48:28,683 --> 00:48:32,562
Then I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

672
00:48:34,443 --> 00:48:37,083
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

673
00:48:39,604 --> 00:48:41,401
You're terrified
of what you might say.

674
00:48:47,243 --> 00:48:49,154
Your move, chief.

675
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:56,074
Hello? Hello?

676
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:58,917
Hello?

677
00:49:59,844 --> 00:50:01,755
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

678
00:50:05,404 --> 00:50:06,392
Freak.

679
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,963
Oh. Oh, God.

680
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:14,156
- Christ, who did you call?
- No one. I forgot the number.

681
00:50:14,284 --> 00:50:17,594
You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out
there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number?

682
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:20,761
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

683
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,957
Why don't we get off of mothers?
I just got off of yours.

684
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:28,515
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch!

685
00:50:28,644 --> 00:50:30,794
- Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

686
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:32,642
- Watch what happens. - All right,
then, Morgan! - Watch what happens.

687
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,720
- What are you gonna fuckin' do to me?
- Keep fuckin' with me.

688
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,401
No smoking.

689
00:51:13,044 --> 00:51:15,399
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

690
00:51:15,525 --> 00:51:18,597
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

691
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:21,319
- It's pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

692
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:25,233
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

693
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:29,074
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood?

694
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:32,993
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

695
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:36,834
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

696
00:51:36,965 --> 00:51:40,844
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

697
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:44,719
- But I can do the sum.
- Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

698
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:47,643
But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing
this way, then...

699
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:50,359
Hey, look, look.

700
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:53,364
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

701
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:06,644
Sometimes people get lucky.

702
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,597
You're a brilliant man.

703
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:46,840
You know, I was on this plane once.

704
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:49,434
And I'm sittin' there, and, uh...

705
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,002
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you
know, "We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. "

706
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,081
But then he puts the mike down,
he forgets to turn it off.

707
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:58,845
And so he turns to the copilot.
He's like, "You know...

708
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:03,117
all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

709
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:07,080
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

710
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:09,800
This buy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

711
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:14,163
You ever been on a plane?

712
00:53:14,286 --> 00:53:17,119
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

713
00:53:17,246 --> 00:53:19,043
Yeah, it does.

714
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:23,917
I have been laid, you know.

715
00:53:24,046 --> 00:53:26,435
Really? Goody for you.

716
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,078
- Big time. Big time.
- Big time, huh?

717
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:31,165
Yeah. I went on a date last week.

718
00:53:31,286 --> 00:53:34,084
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

719
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:35,878
- You goin' out again?
- I don't know.

720
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:37,725
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

721
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:40,964
- Christ, you're an amateur. -
I know what I'm doin'. - Really?

722
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:45,080
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

723
00:53:45,206 --> 00:53:47,400
Yeah, but this girl is like,
you know, beautiful.

724
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:51,838
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

725
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:53,718
So call her up, Romeo.

726
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:55,565
Why? So I can realize
she's not that smart?

727
00:53:55,686 --> 00:53:57,836
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

728
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:01,277
This girl is like fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna r-ruin that.

729
00:54:02,246 --> 00:54:05,124
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

730
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:08,643
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

731
00:54:08,766 --> 00:54:12,840
That way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

732
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:18,723
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

733
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:21,077
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

734
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:24,278
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

735
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:27,084
Sorry I shared that with you.

736
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:30,563
And one night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

737
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:35,005
She woke up and gone like,
"Was that you?"

738
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:37,959
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

739
00:54:38,086 --> 00:54:40,476
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

740
00:54:45,406 --> 00:54:50,401
Oh, Christ. Ah, but, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

741
00:54:50,526 --> 00:54:53,121
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

742
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:57,400
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

743
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,563
The little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

744
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:02,917
That's what made her my wife.

745
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:06,119
Boy, and she had the goods on me, too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

746
00:55:07,006 --> 00:55:10,443
People call these things imperfections,
but they're not.

747
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:12,955
Oh, that's the good stuff.

748
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:16,443
And then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds.

749
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,238
You're not perfect, sport.

750
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,323
And let me save you the suspense.

751
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:25,325
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

752
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:29,043
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

753
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:32,399
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

754
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:34,920
Now, you can know everything
in the world, sport...

755
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:38,279
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

756
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:41,002
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

757
00:55:41,127 --> 00:55:45,325
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

758
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:50,202
Yeah, why not? You told me
every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

759
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,636
You fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

760
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:56,680
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

761
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,638
Yeah.

762
00:56:03,087 --> 00:56:06,875
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

763
00:56:07,007 --> 00:56:09,999
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead!

764
00:56:12,808 --> 00:56:15,560
Yeah. Well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

765
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:17,644
I mean, that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

766
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:19,485
without ever really knowing anybody.

767
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:23,915
Time's up.

768
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:40,360
Hold it open.

769
00:56:40,488 --> 00:56:42,399
- Okay.
- Thank you.

770
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:57,568
I am happy with you

771
00:56:58,768 --> 00:57:02,522
I know I'm about to love you

772
00:57:02,647 --> 00:57:07,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him

773
00:57:07,887 --> 00:57:10,721
Oh, my, you made me...

774
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:13,123
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

775
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:17,166
- Hello.
- Hey.

776
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:20,007
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been like...

777
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:22,642
I've been really busy, and...
But, um...

778
00:57:22,768 --> 00:57:25,236
Me, too. Yeah.

779
00:57:25,368 --> 00:57:28,041
I... I thought you'd call.

780
00:57:29,688 --> 00:57:31,440
Yeah. Um...

781
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:33,445
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time, too.

782
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:35,524
I mean, I just... I...

783
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,479
I'm sorry, you know.
I, I blew it.

784
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,839
No, no. I mean, you know,
it's all right.

785
00:57:39,968 --> 00:57:44,883
Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was wonderin' if, uh,
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.

786
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:48,523
- You know, let me take you out again.
- Oh, I can't.

787
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:51,520
- All right.
- Oh, no. I didn't...

788
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:55,323
I didn't mean I can't, like ever.
I just can't right now.

789
00:57:55,449 --> 00:57:58,281
I've got to assign the proton spectrum
for "ebogamine. "

790
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:00,240
All that sounds really, really
interesting.

791
00:58:00,368 --> 00:58:02,166
It's actually fantastically boring.

792
00:58:02,289 --> 00:58:04,882
- All right, um...
- But, um, maybe some other time.

793
00:58:05,009 --> 00:58:08,239
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

794
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:10,563
- Okay.
- Okay.

795
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:12,485
- Bye.
- Bye.

796
00:58:26,928 --> 00:58:29,601
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

797
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:34,565
- Where the fuck did you get this?
- I had to sleep with someone in your class.

798
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:38,203
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

799
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:43,918
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- No, I... I've got to learn this.

800
00:58:44,049 --> 00:58:46,483
Well, you're not goin' to his surgery
tomorrow, are you?

801
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:48,520
- No.
- Let's go.

802
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,759
Oh, my God. My dog is winning!

803
00:58:56,568 --> 00:58:58,083
Come on, Misty!

804
00:58:58,209 --> 00:59:00,723
Come on, run! Look at that!
Come on!

805
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:02,646
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

806
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:07,443
- And Misty flying down the track.
- We won.

807
00:59:07,569 --> 00:59:09,400
I totally won!

808
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:15,123
- So did you grow up around here, then?
- Not far. South Boston.

809
00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:19,879
- Still glowing from my win.
- Yeah, I know. Look at you.

810
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,806
You're so happy.

811
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,644
- What was that like then?
- It was, you know, normal I guess. Nothin' special.

812
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,926
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

813
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:34,564
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

814
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:36,645
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

815
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,079
Right. That's right.

816
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,084
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

817
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,641
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

818
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:51,841
Seven? Eight? How many?

819
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:54,005
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not have 12 brothers.

820
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:56,803
I swear to God, I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

821
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,682
Do you know all their names?

822
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:02,403
- Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
- What are they called?

823
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,602
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

824
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,721
Say it again.

825
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:14,002
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

826
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:17,208
- And Willy.
- Willy?

827
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,649
- Yeah.
- Will.

828
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,681
Wow! Do you still see all of them?

829
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,483
Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. I'm,
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

830
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,679
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

831
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,519
- Well, I'd like to meet them.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

832
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:31,923
Oh, you know, I read your book
last night.

833
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,564
Oh, so you're the one.

834
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,521
Do you still, uh, do you still
counsel veterans?

835
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,799
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

836
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,920
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

837
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:45,522
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh...

838
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,925
if you never met your wife?

839
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:50,406
- What, wonder if I'd be better off without her?
- No, no, no.

840
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:53,044
- I'm not saying like better off. I didn't mean it like that.
- No, it's all right.

841
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,604
It's an important question.

842
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,960
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

843
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,161
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

844
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,727
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

845
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,364
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

846
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:09,642
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

847
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,530
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

848
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,211
October 21, 1975.

849
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,241
Jesus Christ, you know the fuckin' day?

850
01:01:22,369 --> 01:01:27,125
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

851
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,399
Yeah, sure.

852
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:32,080
My friends and I had, you know, slept out
on the sidewalk all night to get tickets.

853
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:35,520
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar...

854
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,960
waitin' for the game to start,
and in walks this girl.

855
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:41,810
It was an amazing game, though. You
know, bottom of the 8th, Carbo ties it up.

856
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,364
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

857
01:01:44,491 --> 01:01:49,041
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.

858
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:50,808
- You know, he's got that weird stance.
- Yeah, yeah.

859
01:01:50,931 --> 01:01:53,684
And then, boom!
He clocks it, you know. High!

860
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,119
Fly ball down the left field line!

861
01:01:56,251 --> 01:01:59,049
35,000 people on their feet
yellin' at the ball.

862
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:01,445
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

863
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:03,242
- You know, "Get over! Get over!"
- Yeah, I've seen that. Right. Right.

864
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,443
"Get over!" And then it hits
the foul pole.

865
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:11,041
Well, he goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans,
you know, they charge the field. You know?

866
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:13,366
- Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.
- And he's goin', goin', "Look out!

867
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,447
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

868
01:02:15,571 --> 01:02:18,562
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to
that fuckin' game! Did you rush the field?

869
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:21,568
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

870
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,569
- What?
- No, I was in a bar having a drink with my future wife.

871
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:26,568
- You missed Pudge Fisk's home run?
- Oh, yeah.

872
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:28,885
To have a fuckin' drink with some lady
you never met?

873
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,126
Yeah, but you should've seen her.
She was a stunner.

874
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:33,685
- I don't care if fuckin'...
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

875
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:36,644
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room! That's game six!
- Oh, Helen of Troy.

876
01:02:36,771 --> 01:02:39,683
Oh, my God. And who are these fuckin' friends
of yours? They let you get away with that?

877
01:02:39,811 --> 01:02:42,324
- Oh, they had to. - What do you mean,
they had? W- What did you say to 'em?

878
01:02:42,452 --> 01:02:44,725
I just slid my ticket across the table
and I said...

879
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:48,048
"Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl. "

880
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:50,240
"I gotta go see about a girl"?
Yeah, that's what you said?

881
01:02:50,372 --> 01:02:51,724
- I had to.
- And they let you get away with that?

882
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,445
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes
that I meant it.

883
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:57,529
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

884
01:02:57,651 --> 01:03:00,085
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

885
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:03,169
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

886
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,680
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

887
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:08,564
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counselling when she got sick.

888
01:03:08,691 --> 01:03:11,365
And I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

889
01:03:12,851 --> 01:03:15,968
And I sure as hell don't regret
missin' a damn game.

890
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,604
That's regret.

891
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:19,528
Wow!

892
01:03:25,411 --> 01:03:27,209
Would've been nice
to catch that game, though.

893
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:29,561
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

894
01:03:32,531 --> 01:03:36,888
You know, I'm very, very useful
on the court. I'm extremely tall.

895
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:41,446
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

896
01:03:44,051 --> 01:03:47,282
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

897
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:50,449
"Lt is decidedly so. " Hmph.

898
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:56,083
Why do we always stay here?

899
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:58,203
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

900
01:03:58,332 --> 01:04:00,640
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

901
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:02,842
I know.

902
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:05,360
When am I gonna meet your friends
and your brothers?

903
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:08,688
Oh. Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

904
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:10,882
Well, I think I can make it
to South Boston.

905
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:14,646
It's kind of a hike.

906
01:04:14,772 --> 01:04:18,320
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

907
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:21,330
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

908
01:04:21,452 --> 01:04:24,091
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

909
01:04:24,212 --> 01:04:28,569
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

910
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:37,361
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

911
01:04:37,492 --> 01:04:40,723
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

912
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:43,810
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

913
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:48,004
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get like an advance payment?

914
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:50,009
I don't know. Let's ask.

915
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:53,481
- "Outlook does not look good. "
- What?

916
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:56,080
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No, nothing.
Go back to sleep.

917
01:04:56,212 --> 01:04:59,170
"Outlook does not... " That's the same thing that told
you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. I think I'm in.

918
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:02,205
Well, exactly, so look out. You better
start buying some season tickets.

919
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:08,322
I- I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

920
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:10,170
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

921
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:12,886
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

922
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:15,082
Maybe I'm all about three points.

923
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:17,889
I'm all about home runs.

924
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:22,483
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

925
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:36,569
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

926
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:40,207
And Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind... "

927
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:46,167
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

928
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:48,249
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

929
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:52,206
You know, my Uncle Marty drinks. You know.
He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

930
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,766
I ever tell you what happened to him when he
was drivin' up there and he got pulled over?

931
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:56,564
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, Marty, yeah.

932
01:05:56,693 --> 01:05:58,365
Let me tell you about... Let me tell ya
what happened to my Uncle Marty...

933
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,643
because you oughta know this.

934
01:06:00,772 --> 01:06:04,049
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here, he's got another story.

935
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:07,847
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead.

936
01:06:07,973 --> 01:06:11,602
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

937
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:15,567
Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

938
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:20,244
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked!

939
01:06:20,372 --> 01:06:22,762
This state trooper, uh, sees him
and pulls him over.

940
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:25,691
So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out
of the car, and tried to make him walk the line.

941
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:30,250
He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the
guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

942
01:06:30,373 --> 01:06:33,842
So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

943
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:37,852
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road
there's this huge fuckin' boom, right?

944
01:06:37,973 --> 01:06:41,363
- So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around...
- He got shot?

945
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:43,085
- No, no.
- So, so...

946
01:06:43,213 --> 01:06:46,011
- You've heard this story before.
- Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it.

947
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:49,443
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
Okay? There was an accident.

948
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:53,846
- Anyway... Shut the fuck up!
- How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him?

949
01:06:53,973 --> 01:06:56,407
- I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving
him nuts, Morgan. - Shut up! Okay, shut up.

950
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:58,170
- Sorry.
- He told you the story once before. Go ahead.

951
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:00,602
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

952
01:07:00,732 --> 01:07:04,725
So statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

953
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:08,289
After a few minutes of, of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

954
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:10,643
my uncle st-starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

955
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:13,003
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

956
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:15,931
Well, the next mornin',
my uncle's just passed out...

957
01:07:16,052 --> 01:07:18,008
and he hears this knocking at the door.

958
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:21,092
So he goes downstairs,
fuckin' pulls the door open. "What?"

959
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:23,124
Lt's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

960
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,768
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What? '
You know what.

961
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:28,566
I pulled you over last night is what,
and you fuckin' took off. "

962
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:30,888
He's like, "Bet you I never seen you
before in my life.

963
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,766
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

964
01:07:33,894 --> 01:07:36,965
He said, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

965
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:39,289
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let met get in your garage. "

966
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:41,974
My uncle's like, "All right, fine. " Takes
him 'round to the garage, opens the door.

967
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:46,962
And there's... The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

968
01:07:48,373 --> 01:07:51,889
He was so fuckin'... He was so fuckin'
hammered, he drove the wrong car home.

969
01:07:52,013 --> 01:07:55,449
And the best part about it is
the fuckin' state trooper...

970
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:57,929
had been so embarrassed,
he didn't do anything...

971
01:07:58,053 --> 01:08:01,285
'cause he'd been drivin' around all night
in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

972
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:05,168
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

973
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:07,125
Well, he goes away.
That's the point.

974
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:10,485
- All right. Well, question. Are you...
- Come on, stop.

975
01:08:10,614 --> 01:08:12,889
I'm tryin' to clarify somethin', probably
'cause you're too embarrassed to ask...

976
01:08:13,014 --> 01:08:14,811
'cause you know
it doesn't make any sense.

977
01:08:14,934 --> 01:08:17,653
It does make sense if you listen
to the story and quit askin' questions.

978
01:08:17,773 --> 01:08:20,891
Morgan, let's see if you can get this
one. I've got a little story for ya.

979
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:26,247
All right. There's an old couple
in bed. Mary and Paddie.

980
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:30,970
And they wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

981
01:08:31,094 --> 01:08:33,369
And Mary looks over
and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

982
01:08:33,494 --> 01:08:38,284
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're
such a good-lookin' fella. I love ya.

983
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,483
I want to give ya
a little present.

984
01:08:40,614 --> 01:08:43,526
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

985
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,451
What would you like?"

986
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:49,852
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

987
01:08:49,974 --> 01:08:54,684
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missin'...

988
01:08:54,814 --> 01:08:59,285
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

989
01:08:59,414 --> 01:09:02,087
I would like for it. "
And Mary's like, "All right. "

990
01:09:02,214 --> 01:09:06,367
She takes her teeth out, puts them in
the glass, and she gives him a blow job.

991
01:09:06,494 --> 01:09:10,168
And afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah,
geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

992
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:14,003
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

993
01:09:14,134 --> 01:09:16,126
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

994
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:19,212
Ls there anything
that I can do for you?"

995
01:09:19,334 --> 01:09:23,771
And Mary looks up to him
and she goes, "Give us a kiss. "

996
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:27,011
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

997
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:29,365
- That's filthy.
- Not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

998
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:35,770
Get off of me! Lt's this fuckin'...

999
01:09:35,894 --> 01:09:38,772
- All right, see you guys later.
- All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1000
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:42,970
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1001
01:09:43,094 --> 01:09:44,971
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1002
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:48,132
Ah, well, you don't want to rush the judgment on
that one 'cause, you know, they're not all like me.

1003
01:09:48,254 --> 01:09:50,893
Oh, well, I'm sure.
But it was nice to meet ya.

1004
01:09:52,175 --> 01:09:53,608
- Take it easy.
- Oh, all right.

1005
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:56,169
- Slowly back away.
- Oh, come on. Hey. Brother.

1006
01:09:56,294 --> 01:09:59,367
I don't know what you're doin', dude.
You're givin' us a ride.

1007
01:09:59,494 --> 01:10:01,564
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
- Come on, Chuck.

1008
01:10:01,695 --> 01:10:03,686
Else you're walkin', bitch.
WilI's takin' the car.

1009
01:10:04,854 --> 01:10:06,810
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1010
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,608
Wait, wait. I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1011
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:11,532
You're droppin' me off first.

1012
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:14,043
- Dude, it's really out of the way.
- Oh, okay.

1013
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,370
- It's real far. - Just 'cause you have
to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1014
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:18,086
- don't start thinkin' you're bad.
- All right, come on.

1015
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,365
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1016
01:10:20,494 --> 01:10:23,293
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon.

1017
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:27,044
He knows once you see that little shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1018
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:29,131
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1019
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:31,451
No. We're gonna do that another time.

1020
01:10:31,575 --> 01:10:33,372
All right.

1021
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:37,484
Need them keys.

1022
01:10:37,615 --> 01:10:41,370
The stewardess hears this and
goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1023
01:10:41,495 --> 01:10:44,646
And I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

1024
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:47,369
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1025
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:49,407
- For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
- Yeah.

1026
01:10:49,535 --> 01:10:51,571
- I know someone that it actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke?

1027
01:10:51,695 --> 01:10:54,653
- Gerry. Have trouble findin' the place?
- Hi. No, I took a cab.

1028
01:10:54,775 --> 01:10:58,450
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1029
01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:01,248
- How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
- Pleased to meet ya.

1030
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,924
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, no, just a Perrier.

1031
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:06,807
That's French for club soda.

1032
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:10,052
- Huh. Club soda, yeah.
- Yeah. A couple of sandwiches, too.

1033
01:11:10,175 --> 01:11:11,449
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1034
01:11:11,576 --> 01:11:13,646
You ever plan on payin' your tab?

1035
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:15,925
Yeah, chief. Got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1036
01:11:16,055 --> 01:11:17,534
- What's the jackpot?
- $12 million.

1037
01:11:17,655 --> 01:11:22,172
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change operation.

1038
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:27,570
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:11:31,576 --> 01:11:34,329
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1040
01:11:34,455 --> 01:11:36,890
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1041
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:42,329
Have you talked to him at all
about his future?

1042
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:45,846
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1043
01:11:45,975 --> 01:11:49,366
Well, maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1044
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:53,171
- What kind?
- Well, cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1045
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:56,493
The kind of place where a mind
like WilI's is given free rein.

1046
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:59,050
That's, that's great
that there are offers...

1047
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:01,053
but I, I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1048
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:07,653
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1049
01:12:09,016 --> 01:12:11,610
- Well, what don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1050
01:12:11,736 --> 01:12:13,533
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1051
01:12:13,656 --> 01:12:17,489
Just so you don't get
sticky fingers, huh?

1052
01:12:17,617 --> 01:12:20,687
Tim, can you help us?
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1053
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:22,044
Uh-oh.

1054
01:12:22,177 --> 01:12:25,452
- You ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1055
01:12:25,576 --> 01:12:28,090
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1056
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:33,369
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1057
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,004
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1058
01:12:37,136 --> 01:12:38,933
- So, who won the bet?
- I did.

1059
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,093
This isn't about me, Sean. I'm...

1060
01:12:45,936 --> 01:12:47,927
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1061
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:53,173
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1062
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:56,174
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown...

1063
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:58,969
for their study of the universe,
but it was a...

1064
01:12:59,096 --> 01:13:02,133
It was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1065
01:13:02,256 --> 01:13:04,724
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world.

1066
01:13:04,856 --> 01:13:06,653
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1067
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:09,131
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1068
01:13:09,257 --> 01:13:13,693
We all would've lost something.
Tim would never have heard of him.

1069
01:13:13,817 --> 01:13:16,728
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1070
01:13:16,856 --> 01:13:19,290
This boy has that gift.

1071
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,771
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1072
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:24,410
Hey, Gerry,
in the 1960s...

1073
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,925
there was a young man graduated
from the University of Michigan.

1074
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:30,129
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1075
01:13:30,257 --> 01:13:32,407
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1076
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:34,492
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1077
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:38,405
Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to
Montana and he blew the competition away.

1078
01:13:38,536 --> 01:13:41,290
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1079
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,134
Haven't heard of him.

1080
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:44,610
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1081
01:13:44,737 --> 01:13:47,773
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1082
01:13:49,656 --> 01:13:54,128
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We gotta give this kid direction.

1083
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,851
He can contribute to the world, and,
and we can help him do that.

1084
01:13:56,976 --> 01:13:59,570
- Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another, all right?
- Sean!

1085
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:02,894
- We have to let him find...
- Sean, I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache...

1086
01:14:03,016 --> 01:14:05,815
and hatching a, hatching a plan
to ruin this boy's life.

1087
01:14:05,937 --> 01:14:08,734
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was, when I was 18...

1088
01:14:08,856 --> 01:14:11,609
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1089
01:14:11,737 --> 01:14:13,533
Well, maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1090
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:16,251
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1091
01:14:16,377 --> 01:14:20,052
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1092
01:14:20,176 --> 01:14:22,247
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry.
Let's talk about the boy.

1093
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:25,210
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1094
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:28,409
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1095
01:14:28,537 --> 01:14:30,971
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick.

1096
01:14:32,456 --> 01:14:35,609
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I came here today.

1097
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,773
I came here out of courtesy.
I- I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1098
01:14:37,897 --> 01:14:39,888
Oh, nice to be in the loop.

1099
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,407
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1100
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:47,371
Well, Will, uh, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean.

1101
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:49,295
We've already offered you
a position.

1102
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:51,612
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1103
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,047
You think you can find somebody who does,
let me tell you, you have my blessin'.

1104
01:14:55,178 --> 01:14:58,214
But I think we all know that person's
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1105
01:14:58,337 --> 01:15:01,329
Will, our offer
i- is $84,000 a year plus...

1106
01:15:01,457 --> 01:15:06,167
Retainer
Retainer.

1107
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:08,811
You want us to give you cash
right now?

1108
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:12,816
Whoa-ho-ho. Go easy.
Now, I didn't say that.

1109
01:15:12,937 --> 01:15:17,853
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1110
01:15:17,977 --> 01:15:20,093
would be concurrently improved...

1111
01:15:20,217 --> 01:15:23,812
if I had $200
in my back pocket right now.

1112
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:29,170
Well, I don't think I-I can, uh, uh...
Larry?

1113
01:15:29,297 --> 01:15:33,291
- I've got $73.
- Uh, will you take a cheque?

1114
01:15:34,778 --> 01:15:37,850
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1115
01:15:37,977 --> 01:15:40,048
Yeah, you.

1116
01:15:40,178 --> 01:15:44,171
I don't know what your reputation is
in this town...

1117
01:15:44,298 --> 01:15:48,370
but after the shit you tried to pull
today, you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1118
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:53,208
Now, any business
we have heretofore...

1119
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:55,771
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1120
01:15:56,977 --> 01:16:00,732
Good day, gentlemen.
And until that day comes...

1121
01:16:00,858 --> 01:16:02,655
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1122
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,168
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1123
01:16:18,299 --> 01:16:20,289
Yeah.

1124
01:16:20,418 --> 01:16:23,137
Good.

1125
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:26,169
- You want some help?
- No.

1126
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:28,892
- Come on. Give me one little peek, we'll go to the batting cages.
- No.

1127
01:16:31,098 --> 01:16:34,568
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1128
01:16:34,697 --> 01:16:38,327
- It's really important to me. Okay?
- All right. All right.

1129
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:43,131
- So, why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1130
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:48,855
All right, Mr Nosey Parker.

1131
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:53,175
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1132
01:16:53,299 --> 01:16:55,095
let me ask you a question.

1133
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:57,210
All right.

1134
01:16:57,339 --> 01:17:01,013
Do you have a photographic memory?

1135
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:02,935
I don't know.
I just kinda remember, you know?

1136
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:06,415
I mean, how do you remember your
phone number? You know? You just do.

1137
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:09,371
- Well, have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1138
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:12,092
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1139
01:17:12,218 --> 01:17:14,891
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1140
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:17,452
Are you mad?

1141
01:17:17,578 --> 01:17:21,537
Have you completely lost your mind?
Nobody studies it for fun.

1142
01:17:21,659 --> 01:17:24,570
It's not a, a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1143
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:26,848
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1144
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:30,938
Someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars.

1145
01:17:31,058 --> 01:17:32,890
I mean, I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1146
01:17:33,019 --> 01:17:34,338
Oh.

1147
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:38,332
You know, there are very smart people
here at Harvard.

1148
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:42,168
And even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1149
01:17:42,298 --> 01:17:45,893
And yet, you do it so easily.

1150
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:49,375
I don't understand. I, I, I don't
understand how your mind works.

1151
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:52,093
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1152
01:17:52,218 --> 01:17:54,175
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1153
01:17:54,299 --> 01:17:58,497
- Yeah, a bit.
- All right. So when you, when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1154
01:17:58,619 --> 01:18:02,009
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right. Well, Beethoven, okay?

1155
01:18:02,139 --> 01:18:05,814
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1156
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:08,134
- So, what are you saying? You play the piano?
- No, not a lick.

1157
01:18:08,259 --> 01:18:11,934
I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch
of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1158
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:16,575
But Beethoven, Mozart,
they saw it, they could just play.

1159
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:20,169
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1160
01:18:20,299 --> 01:18:22,096
And I can't play the piano.

1161
01:18:22,219 --> 01:18:25,734
But you can do my O-chem paper
in under an hour.

1162
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:27,850
Right. Well, I mean, when it came
to stuff like that...

1163
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:29,856
I could always just play.

1164
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:34,330
That's the best I can explain it.

1165
01:18:35,459 --> 01:18:38,133
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1166
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,854
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1167
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:42,970
Well...

1168
01:18:56,819 --> 01:19:01,211
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1169
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:04,251
I've been here for four years...

1170
01:19:04,379 --> 01:19:06,973
and I've only just found you.

1171
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,009
Well, you found me.

1172
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:23,335
Are you awake?

1173
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:25,336
Nope.

1174
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,215
Yes, you are.

1175
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,091
Will, come to California with me.

1176
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:37,457
What?

1177
01:19:39,419 --> 01:19:42,058
I want you to come to California
with me.

1178
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:48,897
You sure about that?

1179
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:51,454
Oh, yeah.

1180
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,492
Yeah, but how do you know?

1181
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:58,374
I don't know.
I just know.

1182
01:19:58,499 --> 01:20:01,253
Yeah, but h-how do you know?

1183
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:06,249
I know because I feel it.

1184
01:20:06,379 --> 01:20:08,847
- 'Cause that's a really serious thing you're sayin'. I mean...
- I, I know.

1185
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:11,335
You could be in California next week,
and you know...

1186
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,815
you might find out something about me
you don't like, and, you know...

1187
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,818
maybe you wish you hadn't said that, but
you know it's such a serious thing...

1188
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,249
that you can't take it back,
and now I'm stuck in California...

1189
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:23,053
with someone that doesn't really want to
be with me, just wish they had a take-back.

1190
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:26,377
A what? What's a take-back?

1191
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:28,729
I don't want a take-back.

1192
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:32,296
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1193
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,617
Well, I can't go to California
with you, so...

1194
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:42,771
- Why not?
- Well, one, because I, I, I got a job here.

1195
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,289
And two, because I live here.

1196
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:49,208
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me because...

1197
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,219
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1198
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:57,369
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1199
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,377
What am I so scared of?

1200
01:20:59,501 --> 01:21:02,777
Well, what aren't you scared of?

1201
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,530
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you, and you're scared shitless to do anything else.

1202
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:09,572
- Because that might mean that you'd have to change.
- Don't, don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1203
01:21:09,701 --> 01:21:11,851
I mean, you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town.

1204
01:21:11,981 --> 01:21:14,858
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1205
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,891
who your parents will approve of,
and just sit around...

1206
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,457
with the other trust-fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin', too, once.

1207
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,378
Why are you saying this?

1208
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:25,934
What is your obsession with this money?

1209
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:30,339
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1210
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:35,581
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1211
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:37,532
That I would give it back in a second...

1212
01:21:37,661 --> 01:21:40,095
if it meant I could have one more day
with him, but I can't.

1213
01:21:40,221 --> 01:21:42,212
And that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1214
01:21:42,341 --> 01:21:45,333
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1215
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:47,974
I'm afraid? W-W-What am I afraid of?
So, what the fuck am I afraid of?

1216
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:50,490
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1217
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:52,816
And you know what?
I'm afraid, too!

1218
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,933
But fuck it, I wanna give it a shot.
And at least I'm honest with you.

1219
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:59,815
- I'm not honest with you?
- No. What about your 12 brothers?

1220
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:01,772
All right.

1221
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,971
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1222
01:22:04,101 --> 01:22:06,820
What do you wanna know? What?
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1223
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:09,217
- That I'm a fuckin' orphan? No, you don't wanna hear that.
- I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

1224
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,811
No, you don't wanna hear that. You don't wanna hear that I
got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid.

1225
01:22:12,941 --> 01:22:14,977
- Honey, I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1226
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:18,332
That the motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar!

1227
01:22:18,461 --> 01:22:20,850
- I do wanna hear that.
- Don't tell me you wanna hear that shit!

1228
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,939
- I wanna hear it because I wanna help you, because I wanna be with you.
- Help me? What the fuck!

1229
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:26,655
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1230
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:28,179
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1231
01:22:28,302 --> 01:22:32,055
- No! God, I just want to be with you because I love you.
- Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me.

1232
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,900
- Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
- I love you. I love you.

1233
01:22:35,022 --> 01:22:37,376
I love you.

1234
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:42,496
I wanna hear you say
that you don't love me.

1235
01:22:42,621 --> 01:22:44,577
Because if you say that...

1236
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,297
then I won't call you...

1237
01:22:49,622 --> 01:22:52,533
and I won't be in your life.

1238
01:22:58,742 --> 01:23:00,891
I don't love you.

1239
01:23:04,622 --> 01:23:06,418
You don't...

1240
01:23:39,262 --> 01:23:43,141
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1241
01:23:43,262 --> 01:23:45,855
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1242
01:23:45,982 --> 01:23:49,371
They get convinced they're stupid.

1243
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:52,300
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing...

1244
01:23:52,422 --> 01:23:55,573
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you...

1245
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:57,817
not against you.

1246
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,339
Hello, Will.

1247
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:06,452
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1248
01:24:06,582 --> 01:24:08,379
Sure.

1249
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:13,613
Now, let's see.

1250
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:22,494
Good. This is correct.

1251
01:24:24,022 --> 01:24:26,216
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1252
01:24:26,342 --> 01:24:29,334
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1253
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:32,577
This can't be right.

1254
01:24:34,943 --> 01:24:37,331
This would be very embarrassing.

1255
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:43,136
- Did you ever consider...
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1256
01:24:43,262 --> 01:24:45,059
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1257
01:24:45,182 --> 01:24:49,300
Because I, I gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me.

1258
01:24:49,422 --> 01:24:50,741
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:24:50,863 --> 01:24:52,854
- But did you think of the possibility...
- It's right.

1260
01:24:53,982 --> 01:24:57,816
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1261
01:25:00,983 --> 01:25:02,814
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1262
01:25:03,862 --> 01:25:07,901
I couldn't go. I had a date.
So, uh, so I sent my chief negotiator.

1263
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:14,972
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1264
01:25:15,102 --> 01:25:17,696
But when I set up a meeting with,
with my associates...

1265
01:25:17,823 --> 01:25:20,177
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1266
01:25:20,303 --> 01:25:22,498
- Well, then don't set up any more meetings.
- Well, I won't.

1267
01:25:22,622 --> 01:25:24,852
I'll cancel them.

1268
01:25:24,983 --> 01:25:28,373
I'll give you a job myself. I, I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1269
01:25:28,502 --> 01:25:31,540
Look, maybe I don't wanna spend the, the rest of my
fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

1270
01:25:38,862 --> 01:25:41,696
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1271
01:25:41,823 --> 01:25:44,780
A little appreciation? Do you know
how easy this is for me?

1272
01:25:44,903 --> 01:25:47,939
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1273
01:25:48,063 --> 01:25:49,860
And I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am.

1274
01:25:49,982 --> 01:25:52,417
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin'
sit here and watch you fumble around...

1275
01:25:52,542 --> 01:25:54,374
and fuck it up.

1276
01:25:58,943 --> 01:26:02,413
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1277
01:26:02,543 --> 01:26:06,900
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1278
01:26:20,463 --> 01:26:22,500
Yeah, you're right, Will.

1279
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,143
I can't do this proof.

1280
01:26:28,703 --> 01:26:31,775
But you can. And when it comes to that,
it's only about...

1281
01:26:31,903 --> 01:26:35,101
It's just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me.

1282
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,214
- But I'm one of 'em.
- Sorry.

1283
01:26:37,343 --> 01:26:39,413
Yeah, so am I.

1284
01:26:40,303 --> 01:26:42,578
Most days I wish I never met you...

1285
01:26:45,183 --> 01:26:46,980
because then I could sleep at night.

1286
01:26:47,104 --> 01:26:49,857
And I didn't, I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge...

1287
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:52,782
that there was someone like you
out there.

1288
01:26:58,663 --> 01:27:01,973
I- I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1289
01:27:08,903 --> 01:27:11,133
Bill, hold it.

1290
01:27:11,264 --> 01:27:13,380
Did you hear that?

1291
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:16,061
Morgan!

1292
01:27:16,184 --> 01:27:18,618
Lf you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1293
01:27:18,744 --> 01:27:20,734
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'.

1294
01:27:36,664 --> 01:27:39,497
What's up, fellas?

1295
01:27:39,624 --> 01:27:42,457
Morgan, dude, why don't you jerk off
in your own fuckin' house, dude?

1296
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:46,656
- That's fuckin' filthy.
- I don't got a V.C.R. At my house.

1297
01:27:46,784 --> 01:27:50,493
- You're kiddin'.
- Come on. Not in my glove.

1298
01:27:50,624 --> 01:27:52,899
I didn't, I didn't use the glove.

1299
01:27:53,024 --> 01:27:54,822
That's my Little League glove.

1300
01:27:57,064 --> 01:27:59,659
What do you want me to do?

1301
01:27:59,784 --> 01:28:01,854
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1302
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:03,940
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1303
01:28:04,064 --> 01:28:07,294
I didn't. I didn't.
I just used it for the, for cleanup.

1304
01:28:08,344 --> 01:28:10,812
Will you stop jerkin' off
in my mother's room, please?

1305
01:28:10,944 --> 01:28:14,016
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1306
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:20,221
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1307
01:28:20,344 --> 01:28:23,416
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1308
01:28:23,544 --> 01:28:26,422
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1309
01:28:26,544 --> 01:28:29,217
because we've classified it.

1310
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:32,734
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1311
01:28:32,864 --> 01:28:35,743
Code breaking.

1312
01:28:35,865 --> 01:28:38,379
Well, that's one aspect
of what we do.

1313
01:28:38,504 --> 01:28:40,302
Oh, come on.
I mean, that is what you do.

1314
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:43,336
You guys handle 80%
of the intelligence workload.

1315
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:45,853
You're seven times the size
of the C.I.A.

1316
01:28:45,985 --> 01:28:48,896
We don't like to brag
about that, Will.

1317
01:28:49,025 --> 01:28:52,061
But you're exactly right.

1318
01:28:52,185 --> 01:28:55,256
So, the way I see it,
the question isn't...

1319
01:28:55,384 --> 01:28:57,852
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1320
01:28:57,984 --> 01:29:00,419
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1321
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:04,140
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1322
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:08,053
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1323
01:29:08,185 --> 01:29:10,493
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1324
01:29:10,624 --> 01:29:12,421
Somethin' no one else can break.

1325
01:29:12,545 --> 01:29:14,421
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1326
01:29:14,545 --> 01:29:16,615
And I'm real happy with myself
'cause I did my job well.

1327
01:29:16,745 --> 01:29:20,055
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1328
01:29:20,185 --> 01:29:23,416
And once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1329
01:29:23,545 --> 01:29:27,583
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1330
01:29:27,705 --> 01:29:30,583
Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh,
send in the marines to secure the area. "

1331
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:33,139
'Cause they don't give a shit. It won't
be their kid over there gettin' shot.

1332
01:29:33,265 --> 01:29:35,063
Just like it wasn't them
when their number got called...

1333
01:29:35,185 --> 01:29:37,221
'cause they were all pullin' a tour
in the National Guard.

1334
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:40,063
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1335
01:29:40,185 --> 01:29:42,175
He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at...

1336
01:29:42,306 --> 01:29:44,580
got exported to the country
he just got back from...

1337
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,740
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1338
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:49,663
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1339
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:52,093
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1340
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:55,137
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1341
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:58,895
And, of course, the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1342
01:29:59,025 --> 01:30:00,823
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them...

1343
01:30:00,945 --> 01:30:03,333
but it ain't helpin' my buddy
at $2.50 a gallon.

1344
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:05,375
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil back, of course.

1345
01:30:05,506 --> 01:30:07,621
Maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin' an alcoholic skipper...

1346
01:30:07,745 --> 01:30:10,782
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1347
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:12,896
It ain't too long till he hits one,
spills the oil...

1348
01:30:13,025 --> 01:30:15,459
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1349
01:30:15,585 --> 01:30:17,655
So now by buddy's out of work.
He can't afford to drive...

1350
01:30:17,785 --> 01:30:19,776
so he's walkin' to the fuckin'
job interviews, which sucks...

1351
01:30:19,905 --> 01:30:22,418
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin' him chronic haemorrhoids.

1352
01:30:22,546 --> 01:30:24,854
And meanwhile, he's starvin' 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1353
01:30:24,985 --> 01:30:29,661
the only blue plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1354
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:31,582
So what did I think?

1355
01:30:31,705 --> 01:30:35,061
I'm holdin' out for something better.

1356
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:38,257
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1357
01:30:38,386 --> 01:30:40,182
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy...

1358
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:42,661
hike up gas prices, bomb a village,
club a baby seal...

1359
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:45,379
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1360
01:30:45,505 --> 01:30:47,939
I can be elected president.

1361
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:51,137
- You feel like you're alone, Will?
- What?

1362
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:54,494
Do you have a soul mate?

1363
01:30:54,626 --> 01:30:57,186
Do I have a...
Define that.

1364
01:30:57,306 --> 01:30:59,137
Somebody who challenges you.

1365
01:31:00,226 --> 01:31:02,056
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family.

1366
01:31:02,186 --> 01:31:04,653
He'd lie down
in fuckin' traffic for you.

1367
01:31:04,786 --> 01:31:08,142
No, I'm talkin' about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1368
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:13,543
- I got... I got...
- Who?

1369
01:31:13,666 --> 01:31:16,226
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1370
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:19,417
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1371
01:31:19,546 --> 01:31:22,344
- That's great. They're all dead.
- Not to me they're not.

1372
01:31:22,465 --> 01:31:24,661
Nah. You don't have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1373
01:31:25,946 --> 01:31:27,743
You can't give back to them, Will.

1374
01:31:27,866 --> 01:31:30,175
Not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater.

1375
01:31:30,306 --> 01:31:32,262
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1376
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,701
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1377
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:37,942
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1378
01:31:38,066 --> 01:31:41,422
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1379
01:31:41,546 --> 01:31:43,855
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1380
01:31:43,986 --> 01:31:45,305
- No.
- Look, I didn't want the job.

1381
01:31:45,426 --> 01:31:47,735
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1382
01:31:47,866 --> 01:31:50,824
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1383
01:31:52,266 --> 01:31:55,623
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1384
01:31:55,746 --> 01:31:57,782
I mean, there are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1385
01:31:57,906 --> 01:32:00,261
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1386
01:32:00,387 --> 01:32:02,741
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1387
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:05,175
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind, "I didn't ask for this. "

1388
01:32:05,306 --> 01:32:08,503
What do you mean, "cop out"? I mean,
w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick?

1389
01:32:08,626 --> 01:32:11,264
- Nothin'.
- There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1390
01:32:11,387 --> 01:32:15,902
Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted
his ass so I could have an education.

1391
01:32:16,027 --> 01:32:19,383
Exactly. That's an honourable profession.
What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car?

1392
01:32:19,506 --> 01:32:21,861
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. There's honour in that.

1393
01:32:21,987 --> 01:32:24,057
Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour
in that. And there's honour in...

1394
01:32:24,186 --> 01:32:26,097
you know, taking that
40-minute train ride...

1395
01:32:26,226 --> 01:32:28,582
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean.

1396
01:32:28,706 --> 01:32:30,344
And the wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1397
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:32,696
- That's right.
- Right. And that's honourable.

1398
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:36,375
Sure, that's why you took that job.
I mean, for the honour of it.

1399
01:32:36,506 --> 01:32:38,337
I just have a little question here.

1400
01:32:38,467 --> 01:32:41,026
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1401
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:44,661
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1402
01:32:44,787 --> 01:32:47,903
And why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1403
01:32:48,026 --> 01:32:51,736
that only one or two people in the world
could do, and then lie about it?

1404
01:32:54,307 --> 01:32:56,536
'Cause I don't see a lot of honour
in that, Will.

1405
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:01,936
So what do you really want to do?

1406
01:33:05,987 --> 01:33:08,820
- I wanna be a shepherd.
- Really?

1407
01:33:08,946 --> 01:33:11,063
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread...

1408
01:33:11,187 --> 01:33:13,018
get some sheep
and tend to them.

1409
01:33:13,146 --> 01:33:15,899
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1410
01:33:16,027 --> 01:33:18,620
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1411
01:33:18,747 --> 01:33:20,225
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1412
01:33:20,347 --> 01:33:22,178
- Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1413
01:33:22,307 --> 01:33:24,456
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- Listen, you're not gonna answer my questions.

1414
01:33:24,587 --> 01:33:27,307
- You're wastin' my fuckin' time.
- What? I thought we were friends. What do you mean, you...

1415
01:33:27,427 --> 01:33:30,817
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Well, why you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what... I mean...

1416
01:33:30,946 --> 01:33:34,144
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1417
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:36,337
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1418
01:33:36,467 --> 01:33:39,379
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1419
01:33:39,507 --> 01:33:41,497
- Dead.
- That's right, she's fuckin' dead.

1420
01:33:41,627 --> 01:33:44,187
She fuckin' dies, and you just
cash in your chips and you walk away?

1421
01:33:44,307 --> 01:33:48,265
- Hey, at least I played a hand.
- Oh, and you played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1422
01:33:48,387 --> 01:33:51,584
And some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1423
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:54,665
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1424
01:34:01,426 --> 01:34:05,215
You and your bullshit. You got
a bullshit answer for everybody.

1425
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:09,022
But I ask you a very simple question,
and you can't give me a straight answer.

1426
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:12,897
Because you don't know.

1427
01:34:14,467 --> 01:34:16,583
See ya, Bo-Peep.

1428
01:34:19,547 --> 01:34:21,617
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1429
01:34:26,147 --> 01:34:28,103
Shepherd.

1430
01:34:28,228 --> 01:34:30,218
White little prick.

1431
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:33,305
I just wanted to, you know, um...

1432
01:34:33,428 --> 01:34:36,738
call you up, uh, before you left, um...

1433
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:38,823
I've been takin' all these, uh,
job interviews and stuff...

1434
01:34:38,948 --> 01:34:40,983
so I'm not gonna be
just a construction worker.

1435
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:43,861
Well, you know,
I never really cared about that.

1436
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,185
Yeah.

1437
01:34:50,187 --> 01:34:51,506
I love you.

1438
01:34:56,628 --> 01:34:58,061
Will?

1439
01:34:59,547 --> 01:35:00,866
You take care.

1440
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:04,378
Someone's always comin'
around here

1441
01:35:04,508 --> 01:35:06,942
- Trailin' some new kill
- Bye.

1442
01:35:09,068 --> 01:35:11,059
Says I seen your picture

1443
01:35:11,187 --> 01:35:15,625
On a hundred dollar bill

1444
01:35:15,747 --> 01:35:19,661
What's a game of chance to you

1445
01:35:19,787 --> 01:35:22,143
In this world

1446
01:35:23,748 --> 01:35:27,024
Of real skill
So glad to meet you

1447
01:35:27,147 --> 01:35:31,346
Angeles

1448
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,059
Pickin' up the ticket shows

1449
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:38,737
There's money to be made

1450
01:35:40,548 --> 01:35:42,460
Go on, lose the gamble

1451
01:35:42,588 --> 01:35:47,025
That's the history of the trade

1452
01:35:47,148 --> 01:35:52,222
Did you add up
all the cards left to play

1453
01:35:55,348 --> 01:35:59,136
To zero
And sign up with people

1454
01:35:59,268 --> 01:36:01,782
Angeles

1455
01:36:03,228 --> 01:36:06,618
Don't start with me tryin'

1456
01:36:08,949 --> 01:36:11,257
Will, come on.
Will!

1457
01:36:13,348 --> 01:36:15,498
Will, that's it.
We're done here.

1458
01:36:15,628 --> 01:36:18,506
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1459
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:23,863
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
An hour and ten minutes late.

1460
01:36:23,989 --> 01:36:27,538
I can make you satisfied
in everything

1461
01:36:27,668 --> 01:36:29,704
Well, what if he doesn't show up
and I file a report...

1462
01:36:29,828 --> 01:36:31,626
saying he wasn't here
and he goes back to jail?

1463
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:34,387
Lt won't be on my conscience.

1464
01:36:34,508 --> 01:36:37,342
Now becoming true

1465
01:36:37,468 --> 01:36:39,858
Okay. Fine.

1466
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:43,706
What's up?

1467
01:36:45,548 --> 01:36:47,345
Thanks.

1468
01:36:52,029 --> 01:36:53,826
Fuck, that's good.

1469
01:36:57,349 --> 01:36:59,385
So how's your lady?

1470
01:36:59,508 --> 01:37:01,305
Ah, she's gone.

1471
01:37:02,548 --> 01:37:04,664
Gone? Gone where?

1472
01:37:04,789 --> 01:37:08,987
Uh, med school.
Medical school in California.

1473
01:37:09,108 --> 01:37:10,258
- Really?
- Yeah.

1474
01:37:10,389 --> 01:37:12,823
- When was this?
- It was like a week ago.

1475
01:37:17,509 --> 01:37:19,659
That sucks.

1476
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:25,539
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetin's?

1477
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:27,466
I think the week after I'm 21.

1478
01:37:27,589 --> 01:37:30,150
Yeah? They gonna hook you up
with a job or what?

1479
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:34,308
Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1480
01:37:34,429 --> 01:37:37,626
Ah, probably make some nice bank though.

1481
01:37:37,749 --> 01:37:39,546
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1482
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:42,900
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1483
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:44,781
Well, uh, what do I want a way
out of here for?

1484
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:47,343
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here
the rest of my life.

1485
01:37:47,469 --> 01:37:49,460
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

1486
01:37:49,589 --> 01:37:52,342
Fuckin' take them to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1487
01:37:55,509 --> 01:37:57,865
Look, you're my best friend
so don't take this the wrong way...

1488
01:37:57,989 --> 01:38:01,584
but in 20 years,
if you're still livin' here...

1489
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,781
comin' over to my house to watch the
Patriot's games, still workin' construction...

1490
01:38:04,909 --> 01:38:06,901
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1491
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:09,544
- That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.
- What?

1492
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,706
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1493
01:38:11,829 --> 01:38:15,617
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on. W-Why is it always this?

1494
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:18,707
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to myself to do
this or that. What if I don't want to?

1495
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:22,663
Oh, no, no, no. No, fuck you.
You don't owe it to yourself.

1496
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:24,859
You owe it to me...

1497
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:27,378
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
and I'll be 50...

1498
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:30,229
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1499
01:38:30,350 --> 01:38:32,227
And that's all right. That's fine.

1500
01:38:32,349 --> 01:38:34,910
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1501
01:38:35,029 --> 01:38:38,579
And you're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1502
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:43,230
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1503
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,103
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1504
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,585
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1505
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:51,701
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1506
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:53,343
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1507
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:55,460
- No, you don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that.

1508
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:57,386
Let me tell you what I do know.

1509
01:38:57,509 --> 01:39:00,547
Every day I come by your house
and I pick you up.

1510
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:04,504
And we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs, and it's great.

1511
01:39:04,629 --> 01:39:07,144
You know what the best part
of my day is?

1512
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:11,388
For about ten seconds, from when I pull
up to the kerb and when I get to your door.

1513
01:39:11,509 --> 01:39:13,465
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door...

1514
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:16,023
and you won't be there.

1515
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:19,426
No "goodbye," no "see ya later. "
No nothin'. You just left.

1516
01:39:21,109 --> 01:39:24,579
I don't know much, but I know that.

1517
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:37,706
This is a disaster, Sean.

1518
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:40,298
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy.

1519
01:39:40,429 --> 01:39:42,421
- Not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy, Gerry.

1520
01:39:42,551 --> 01:39:45,861
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy! I
don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1521
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:48,424
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1522
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:51,462
- Undermine?
- This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1523
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:54,548
I do understand. He is at a fragile
point, okay? He's got problems.

1524
01:39:54,670 --> 01:39:58,026
Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's
better off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail?

1525
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,947
Better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas?

1526
01:40:01,071 --> 01:40:04,824
Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Do you have any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

1527
01:40:04,951 --> 01:40:08,226
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work, and he obviously handled you.

1528
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:12,264
Gerry, listen to me. Listen. Why is he
hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1529
01:40:12,390 --> 01:40:15,622
Because the first thing that happened to him, he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1530
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:18,025
- Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.
- Oh, no, listen, Gerry.

1531
01:40:18,151 --> 01:40:20,903
And why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1532
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:24,659
Because any one of them, if you asked them to,
would take a fuckin' bat to your head. Okay?

1533
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:26,621
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1534
01:40:26,751 --> 01:40:30,538
And who is he handling? He pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him.

1535
01:40:30,670 --> 01:40:33,060
It's a defence mechanism, all right?

1536
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,625
And for 20 years he's been alone
because of that.

1537
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:38,345
And if you push him right now, it's
gonna be the same thing all over again.

1538
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,267
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

1539
01:40:40,391 --> 01:40:41,983
- Now, don't you do that, Sean.
- What, Gerry?

1540
01:40:42,111 --> 01:40:44,864
Don't you do that. Don't infect him
with the idea that it's okay to quit.

1541
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:47,788
That it's okay to be a failure,
because it's not okay, Sean.

1542
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:51,347
And if you're angry at me for being, being
successful, for being what you could have been, Sean...

1543
01:40:51,471 --> 01:40:54,144
- I'm not angry at you, Gerry.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

1544
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:58,343
You resent me. But I'm not gonna
apologize for any, any success I've had.

1545
01:40:58,471 --> 01:41:00,904
You're angry at me for doing what
you could have done.

1546
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:05,104
But ask yourself, Sean. Ask yourself
if you want Will to feel that way.

1547
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:08,382
- Lf you want him to feel like a failure.
- Oh, you arrogant shit!

1548
01:41:08,511 --> 01:41:10,979
That's why I don't come
to the goddam reunions.

1549
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:12,908
'Cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1550
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:15,784
- You know, that condescending embarrassed look?
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1551
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:17,867
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1552
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:20,788
And I'm proud of what I do.
It was a conscious choice.

1553
01:41:20,912 --> 01:41:22,549
I didn't fuck up.

1554
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:24,866
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1555
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:28,540
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around
going, "The Field's medal! The Field's medal!"

1556
01:41:28,671 --> 01:41:31,630
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid
of failure?

1557
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:35,300
Lt's about my medal, is it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1558
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:38,628
Oh, please don't. You know... You know what, Gerry?
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1559
01:41:38,752 --> 01:41:42,664
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal because
I knew you before you were a mathematical god.

1560
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:46,181
When you were pimple-faced and homesick, and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1561
01:41:46,311 --> 01:41:48,029
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1562
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:50,142
So don't blame me for how your life
turned out. It's not my fault.

1563
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:54,025
I don't blame you. It's not about you,
you mathematical dick!

1564
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:56,585
Lt's about the boy.
He's a good kid.

1565
01:41:56,712 --> 01:41:59,942
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're trying to fuck up me right now.

1566
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:02,540
I won't see you make him feel
like a failure, too.

1567
01:42:02,671 --> 01:42:05,390
- He won't be a failure, Sean!
- But, but if you push him, Gerry...

1568
01:42:05,511 --> 01:42:08,230
- If you ride him...
- Sean, I am what I am today...

1569
01:42:08,352 --> 01:42:11,468
because I was pushed and
because I learned to push myself.

1570
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,867
He's not you! Do you get that?

1571
01:42:15,951 --> 01:42:18,829
- I can come back.
- No, come in. Uh...

1572
01:42:18,952 --> 01:42:21,260
I was just leaving.

1573
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:34,667
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him.

1574
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,908
You know. Not about you.

1575
01:42:42,032 --> 01:42:45,182
- What is that?
- This is your file.

1576
01:42:45,312 --> 01:42:47,586
I have to send it back to the judge
for evaluation.

1577
01:42:47,712 --> 01:42:50,384
Oh.

1578
01:42:50,512 --> 01:42:52,582
Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1579
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:57,989
What's it say?

1580
01:42:59,432 --> 01:43:01,387
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1581
01:43:04,712 --> 01:43:06,828
Have you had any, uh, experience
with that?

1582
01:43:06,951 --> 01:43:10,342
Twenty years of counselling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1583
01:43:11,272 --> 01:43:14,548
I mean, have you had any experience
with that?

1584
01:43:18,432 --> 01:43:20,741
Personally?

1585
01:43:20,872 --> 01:43:22,783
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have.

1586
01:43:24,352 --> 01:43:25,705
It sure ain't good.

1587
01:43:29,632 --> 01:43:33,864
My father was an alcoholic.
Mean, fuckin' drunk.

1588
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:38,150
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1589
01:43:38,272 --> 01:43:41,583
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't
go after my mother and little brother.

1590
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:46,027
Interesting nights
were when he wore his rings.

1591
01:43:47,792 --> 01:43:51,102
Yeah, he used to just put
a, uh, a wrench...

1592
01:43:51,233 --> 01:43:53,825
a stick and a belt
on the table...

1593
01:43:53,953 --> 01:43:56,147
and just say, "Choose. "

1594
01:43:56,273 --> 01:43:57,864
Well, I gotta go with the belt
there, then.

1595
01:43:57,993 --> 01:44:01,872
- I used to go with the wrench.
- Why the wrench?

1596
01:44:01,993 --> 01:44:03,984
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1597
01:44:04,112 --> 01:44:07,309
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1598
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:12,222
So, uh, you know, what is it? Like Will has
an attachment disorder? Ls it all that stuff?

1599
01:44:13,793 --> 01:44:16,261
Fear of abandonment?

1600
01:44:16,393 --> 01:44:19,464
Ls that why, uh, is that why
I broke up with Skylar?

1601
01:44:19,593 --> 01:44:22,789
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1602
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:24,904
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1603
01:44:28,752 --> 01:44:31,220
Hey, Will?

1604
01:44:31,352 --> 01:44:33,308
I don't know a lot.

1605
01:44:34,633 --> 01:44:37,590
But you see this?
All this shit?

1606
01:44:42,472 --> 01:44:44,304
This is not your fault.

1607
01:44:46,313 --> 01:44:48,588
Yeah, I know that.

1608
01:44:48,713 --> 01:44:50,509
Look at me, son.

1609
01:44:51,752 --> 01:44:53,983
It's not your fault.

1610
01:44:54,112 --> 01:44:58,344
- I know.
- No. It's not your fault.

1611
01:45:01,033 --> 01:45:03,149
- I know.
- No, no, you don't.

1612
01:45:03,273 --> 01:45:05,389
It's not your fault.

1613
01:45:07,313 --> 01:45:09,031
- I know.
- It's not your fault.

1614
01:45:09,153 --> 01:45:12,065
- All right.
- It's not your fault.

1615
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:16,590
It's not your fault.

1616
01:45:16,713 --> 01:45:18,544
Don't fuck with me.

1617
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:23,946
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me. All right?

1618
01:45:24,073 --> 01:45:26,985
- Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you.
- It's not your fault.

1619
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:38,381
It's not your fault.

1620
01:45:43,193 --> 01:45:44,990
Oh, my God!

1621
01:45:46,153 --> 01:45:49,907
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

1622
01:46:03,994 --> 01:46:05,824
Fuck them, okay?

1623
01:47:28,754 --> 01:47:30,985
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh, Will Hunting.

1624
01:47:31,114 --> 01:47:34,743
- I'm here about a position.
- Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1625
01:47:38,474 --> 01:47:41,864
Yes, there's a Mr Hunting in the lobby.
He's here for his appointment.

1626
01:48:01,034 --> 01:48:02,990
Which one did you take?

1627
01:48:03,114 --> 01:48:07,665
I was over at, uh, McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1628
01:48:07,795 --> 01:48:11,946
Uh, I haven't told him yet, but I went, I
went down there and I talked to my boss, and...

1629
01:48:12,075 --> 01:48:14,907
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1630
01:48:15,035 --> 01:48:17,867
Is that what you want?

1631
01:48:17,995 --> 01:48:20,589
Yeah, you know, I think so.

1632
01:48:20,714 --> 01:48:23,673
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1633
01:48:23,794 --> 01:48:25,592
Thanks.

1634
01:48:28,595 --> 01:48:30,392
Time's up.

1635
01:48:33,275 --> 01:48:36,267
So that's, so that's it?
So we're, we're done?

1636
01:48:36,395 --> 01:48:38,989
Yeah, that's it.

1637
01:48:39,114 --> 01:48:41,389
You're done. You're a free man.

1638
01:48:43,114 --> 01:48:47,552
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1639
01:48:47,674 --> 01:48:49,472
You're welcome, Will.

1640
01:48:54,675 --> 01:48:57,553
So, you know, I, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1641
01:48:57,675 --> 01:48:59,905
Yeah, me, too.

1642
01:49:00,035 --> 01:49:02,549
I'll be travelling around a bit,
and it'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1643
01:49:02,675 --> 01:49:06,190
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1644
01:49:06,315 --> 01:49:09,624
So, here's the number.

1645
01:49:09,755 --> 01:49:12,188
You call that, and I'll
get back to you right away.

1646
01:49:13,875 --> 01:49:16,548
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1647
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:19,872
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1648
01:49:22,475 --> 01:49:24,750
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1649
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:29,552
Yeah.

1650
01:49:29,675 --> 01:49:31,666
- Thank you, Sean.
- Yeah.

1651
01:49:31,796 --> 01:49:33,706
Thank you, Will.

1652
01:49:35,355 --> 01:49:38,472
Hey, does this violate the, uh,
patient-doctor relationship?

1653
01:49:38,595 --> 01:49:40,711
Nah. Only if you grab my ass.

1654
01:49:44,276 --> 01:49:46,392
- Take care.
- You, too.

1655
01:49:46,515 --> 01:49:48,312
Yeah.

1656
01:49:50,195 --> 01:49:51,993
Hey.

1657
01:49:52,115 --> 01:49:54,345
Good luck, son.

1658
01:50:05,035 --> 01:50:06,991
Two beers!

1659
01:50:11,075 --> 01:50:14,192
- What's up? Did you guys go?
- No. I had to talk him down.

1660
01:50:14,315 --> 01:50:15,874
Why didn't you yoke him?

1661
01:50:15,995 --> 01:50:18,111
Uh, little Morgan's got
a lot of scrap to him.

1662
01:50:18,235 --> 01:50:21,273
You know, people try to whip his ass
every week. Fuckin' kid won't back down.

1663
01:50:21,396 --> 01:50:25,991
- What are you sayin' about me?
- Was I talkin' to you? Mind your fuckin' business.

1664
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:29,184
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers.

1665
01:50:29,316 --> 01:50:31,385
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1666
01:50:31,515 --> 01:50:34,872
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? Fuckin' come on.

1667
01:50:34,996 --> 01:50:37,907
- Come on. I got ya first.
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1668
01:50:38,036 --> 01:50:40,072
- All right, who's first?
- Come on, motherfucker.

1669
01:50:40,196 --> 01:50:43,666
- All right. Who's first? Come on. Who's first?
- Oh, Danny boy

1670
01:50:43,796 --> 01:50:45,707
Here's your present.

1671
01:50:47,196 --> 01:50:48,675
- Come on, brother.
- What?

1672
01:50:48,796 --> 01:50:52,391
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1673
01:50:52,516 --> 01:50:56,907
And, anyway, I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so...

1674
01:50:57,036 --> 01:50:58,628
- Fuckin' can't be.
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1675
01:50:58,756 --> 01:51:00,906
That's not what I was sayin'.

1676
01:51:01,035 --> 01:51:03,266
But, uh, 21 now, so...

1677
01:51:03,396 --> 01:51:06,752
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for you, kid, was a car.

1678
01:51:06,876 --> 01:51:09,106
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1679
01:51:11,756 --> 01:51:15,635
This is the ugliest fuckin' car
I ever seen in my life.

1680
01:51:15,757 --> 01:51:18,748
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1681
01:51:18,875 --> 01:51:21,026
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1682
01:51:21,156 --> 01:51:24,354
and, uh, Morgan was out
panhandlin' for change every day.

1683
01:51:24,477 --> 01:51:27,513
- I had the router do all the bodywork.
- Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1684
01:51:27,636 --> 01:51:30,594
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1685
01:51:30,716 --> 01:51:32,115
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1686
01:51:32,236 --> 01:51:34,228
Yeah, had one.
Now I'm fucked again.

1687
01:51:34,356 --> 01:51:37,393
- So what is it, a lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1688
01:51:37,516 --> 01:51:39,472
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine
ourselves here.

1689
01:51:39,597 --> 01:51:42,554
It's a good car, dude.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1690
01:51:43,435 --> 01:51:46,793
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1691
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,748
Hi.

1692
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,788
Come on in.

1693
01:52:01,357 --> 01:52:04,155
- Sean, I, um...
- Me, too, Gerry.

1694
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:07,468
Yeah. Good.

1695
01:52:09,397 --> 01:52:11,035
- I heard you're takin' some time.
- Yeah.

1696
01:52:11,156 --> 01:52:15,115
I'll travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1697
01:52:15,237 --> 01:52:17,033
So where are you going?

1698
01:52:17,157 --> 01:52:20,911
India and China and Baltimore.

1699
01:52:22,597 --> 01:52:24,553
Oh.

1700
01:52:24,677 --> 01:52:29,876
- You know when you'll be back?
- Well, I got this flyer the other day.

1701
01:52:29,996 --> 01:52:32,829
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1702
01:52:32,957 --> 01:52:34,754
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

1703
01:52:34,876 --> 01:52:36,549
Why don't you come?
I'll buy you a drink.

1704
01:52:37,396 --> 01:52:39,308
The drinks at those things are free.

1705
01:52:39,436 --> 01:52:42,827
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1706
01:52:46,878 --> 01:52:49,310
Oh.

1707
01:52:49,437 --> 01:52:51,904
How about a drink right now?

1708
01:52:52,036 --> 01:52:53,709
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1709
01:52:53,837 --> 01:52:56,068
Come on. This one's on me.

1710
01:52:58,757 --> 01:53:00,794
- Got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh.

1711
01:53:00,917 --> 01:53:02,987
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1712
01:53:04,117 --> 01:53:06,506
This is my ticket to paradise.

1713
01:53:06,637 --> 01:53:08,434
Sean, do you know what the odds are
against winning the lottery?

1714
01:53:08,558 --> 01:53:11,469
- What, four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1715
01:53:11,597 --> 01:53:15,385
- I still have a shot, you know?
- Yes, just about as big a chance...

1716
01:53:15,517 --> 01:53:18,350
as you being hit by lightning
here on the staircase right now.

1717
01:53:18,478 --> 01:53:20,149
Aw, that's a possibility, too, Gerry.

1718
01:53:20,277 --> 01:53:22,552
- I mean, 32 million. If you look at the size...
- Sean!

1719
01:54:48,358 --> 01:54:50,666
Will!

1720
01:55:08,838 --> 01:55:10,669
Will?

1721
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,111
He's not there.

1722
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:37,267
I'll fake it through the day

1723
01:56:37,398 --> 01:56:40,471
Sean, if the professor calls
about that job...

1724
01:56:40,598 --> 01:56:42,669
just tell him sorry.

1725
01:56:42,799 --> 01:56:45,871
I had to go see about a girl.
Will.

1726
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:51,475
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1727
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:56,917
<i>With two tickets</i>

1728
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,078
<i>Torn in half for LA</i>

1729
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:04,669
<i>With nothing to do</i>

1730
01:57:04,799 --> 01:57:07,950
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1731
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,594
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1732
01:57:11,718 --> 01:57:14,791
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1733
01:57:17,079 --> 01:57:21,152
<i>I know you'd rather see me gone</i>

1734
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:23,999
<i>Than to see me</i>

1735
01:57:24,119 --> 01:57:28,112
<i>The way that I am</i>

1736
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:32,790
<i>But I am in the life anyway</i>

1737
01:57:32,919 --> 01:57:35,638
<i>Next door</i>

1738
01:57:35,759 --> 01:57:39,752
<i>The TV's flashing blue</i>

1739
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:43,316
<i>Frames on the wall</i>

1740
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,192
<i>It's a comedy</i>

1741
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,708
<i>Of errors, you see</i>

1742
01:57:48,839 --> 01:57:53,435
<i>It's about taking a fall</i>

1743
01:57:55,759 --> 01:57:57,557
<i>To vanish</i>

1744
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:01,673
<i>Into oblivion</i>

1745
01:58:01,799 --> 01:58:05,348
<i>It's easy to do</i>

1746
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:08,119
<i>And I try to be</i>

1747
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:12,153
<i>But you know me
I come back</i>

1748
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:16,352
<i>When you want me to</i>

1749
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,755
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1750
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:23,350
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1751
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:26,835
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1752
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:44,632
<i>Gonna find my baby
Gonna hold her tight</i>

1753
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:48,195
<i>Gonna grab
some afternoon delight</i>

1754
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,074
<i>My motto's always been
When it's right, it's right</i>

1755
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,556
<i>Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night</i>
