00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,000
To prove to me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
证明他不想讲就不必讲

823
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,340
What is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood?
这是小孩玩的瞪人比赛吗?

824
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,680
Yeah it is and I can't talk first.

We know your theory Alexander.

But the boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

A tree structure won't work.

But I can do the sum.

It's how you group the terms Alexander.

831
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,270
But Gerry. If we do the whole thing this way then...

832
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:00,970

I wrote it down. It's simpler this way.

Sometimes people get lucky.

835
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,510
You're a brilliant man.

836
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,920
You know I was on this plane once and I'm sittin' there and...
我有一次搭飞机  坐在机上...

837
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,930
the captain gets on he does his whole you know "we'll be cruisin' at 35000 feet  "
机长广播完飞行于三万五千尺

But then he puts the mike down. He forgets to turn it off.

我现在很想要口交和咖啡

841

空服员冲去跟他说麦克风没关

You ever been on a plane?

844
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,220
No but it's a fuckin' joke.

It works better if I tell it in the first person.

846

这女孩很漂亮  聪明风趣

So call her up Romeo.

Why so I can realize she's not that smart.
让自己发现她没那么聪明吗?

887

But they're not. That's the good stuff.

This girl you met she isn't perfect either.

But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.
问题是你们是否完美地合适

893

You certainly won't learn from an old fucker like me.
你不能跟我这个糟老头学

你们男人就只会用小弟弟思考

I would hardly say it was a necessity.

You know there are very smart people here at Harvard.

但贝多芬  莫扎特就会弹

我会亲自给你工作

1482
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:10,670
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.
或许我不想一辈子做解说员

1483
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,260
I think you could show me some appreciation.
但你可以表示感激吧

1484
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,760
A little appreciation? Do you know how easy this is for me?
感激?  你知道这多容易吗?

01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:27,440
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy this is? This is a fuckin' joke.
你知道吗?  别他妈的说笑了

1486
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,540
I'm sorry you can't do this...I really am...
我很遗憾你不会解  真的

1487
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,890
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
我不想坐在这儿看你摸索

1488
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:41,720
Then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk instead wouldn't you?
这样你就会有更多的时间喝醉?

1489
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:47,650
You're right. This is probably a total waste of my time.
没错  这浪费我的时间

1490
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,880
You're right Will.

I can't do this proof

but you can. And when it comes to that
但你会  说到这个

1493
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,100
it's only about just a handful of people in the world who can tell the difference between you and me.
只有少数人看出你我的差别

1494
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,830

Sorry.
我很遗憾

1496
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,560
Yeah so am I.
我也是

1497
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,220
Most days I wish I never met you

1498
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:29,490
because then I could sleep at night.
这样我夜里就能睡得着

1499
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:35,410
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge that there was someone like you out there.
不用惦记有个像你这样的人

1500
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:46,260
I didn't have to watch you throw it all away.

如你还敢在我妈房里看A片

Come on. Not in my glove.

I didn't use the glove.

1512

Well you'd be working on the cutting edge.
你将研究尖端科技

1521
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:12,170
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you wouldn't see anywhere else

because we've classified it.

That's one aspect of what we do.

1526
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,090
Oh come on. That is what you do.
得了  那就是你们做的事

1527
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:30,160
You guys handle 80% of the intelligence workload.
你们处理八成的情报量

1528
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,760

是中情局的七倍大

1529
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:39,130

我们不喜欢自夸  但你说对了

1530
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:43,630
So the way I see it the question isn't:"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"
问题不是"你干嘛为国安局做事"

1531
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:48,590
The question is: "Why shouldn't you?"
而是"你为何不做?"

Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?
我为何不为国安局做事?

1533

1534
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,640
but I'll take a shot. Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
让我想想  若我做了

1535
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,430
and somebody puts a code on my desk. Something no one else can break.
国安局会给我破解不了的密码

1536
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,520
Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.
或许我试了  也破解了

Once they have that location they bomb the village where the rebels are hidin'.
他们发现后轰炸叛军藏身地

1541
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:16,170

陌生的一千五百人因此丧命

1542
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:19,340
Now the politicians are saying "Send in the Marines to secure the area  "
然后政客派特战部队防守该区

1543
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,770
'cause they don't give a shit.
他们才不在乎

1544
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:24,040
It won't be their kid over there gettin' shot
因为被射杀的不会是他们的子女

1545
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,980
just like it wasn't them when their number got called 'cause they were in the National Guard.
因为他们都加入了后备部队

1546
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,950

害他中弹的敌人抢了他的饭碗

1550

因为那儿的人一天工资不到一元

1551
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:41,500
Meanwhile he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place...
最后他发现他会上战场...

1552
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,670
was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.
只是为了得到该国的廉价原油

1553

Of course the oil companies used a skirmish over there
好让石油公司利用战争恐慌

但两块五一加仑有个屁用

1556
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,540
They're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil of course.
他们得花时间把石油运回国

1557
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,010
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire an alcoholic skipper
或许还请了一个酗酒船长

他爱喝马丁尼  跟冰山玩滑雪

他走路去面谈  很难受

01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,330
which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.
因为炮弹片让你慢性出血

1564
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,730
Meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat
他很饿  因为每次想吃东西
