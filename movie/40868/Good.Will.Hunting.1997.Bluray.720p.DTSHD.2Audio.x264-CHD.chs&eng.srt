7
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,030
解出来的人不只有好成绩
Now the person to do so will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,770
还可因此纪录名利双收
but also go on to fame and fortune by having their accomplishment recorded and their name printed.

9
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,770
留名麻省理工学院
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

12
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,680
还有卑贱的麻省理工教授
and lowly M.I.T. professors.

13
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,960
就这样  如果有问题
Well that's all. If you have any questions...

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,230
为什么不让我爽
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty little hoochie- woochie...

25
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,380
- 就像平时那样?  - 去你的
- you usually throw at me?  - Oh fuck you...

26
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,070
还有你的爱尔兰脏话

27
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,080
我才不要为了小老二张开腿
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin' my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

Go home and give it a tug yourself.

29
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,620
小老二!

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
小老二!

她少一颗牙
She's missin' a tooth Will.

32
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,300
她皮肤也有问题
She's got skin problems. I don't...

33
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,230
况且到头来摩根八成会娶她
Plus it's like 5- to- 2 Morgan ends up marryin' her you know what I mean?

34
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,770
朋友的准老婆只能上几次

40
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,530
你懂什么?
She don't know. There ain't no Irish curse.

41
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,810
别老故意打到我
Out! Stop pressuring me back.

42
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,050

你以为我怕你啊?

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,560
怎么样?  谢谢你们出来
Hey fellas thanks for comin' out.

141
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,110
过来!
Come here!

142
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,200
操
Ah. Fuck.

143
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,970
这是做梦还是班级变大了?
Is it just my imagination or has my class grown considerably?

144
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,500
如果不是在做梦的话...
Well by no stretch of my imagination...

145
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,380
你们是来听我讲课
do I believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

146
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,820
或想知道神秘数学奇才是谁
Rather to ascertain the identity of the mystery math magician.

147
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,010
沉默的天才  出来领奖吧
So without further adieu come forward silent rogue and receive thy prize.

148
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,670
抱歉让观众失望了
Well I'm sorry to disappoint my spectators but...

149
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,040
看来今天不会揭晓了
it seems there will be no unmasking here today.

150
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,710
我和同事决定再下战帖
However uh my colleagues and l have conferred...

151
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,920
外面黑板上有个题目
and there is a problem on the board right now...

152
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,110
我们花了两年时间才解开
that took us more than two years to prove.

153
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,790
请沉默的天才再解解看
So let this be said: The gauntlet has been thrown down...

154
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,620
全体教授已备有解答
but the faculty have answered and answered with vigor.

155
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,780
几时提讯?
Hey when's the arraignment?

156
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,840
下星期
Next week.

157
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,560
对不起
Sorry.

158
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,210
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

159
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,170
对不起
Sorry.

160
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,310
你不能在人家的方程式上涂鸦
That's people's work. You can't graffiti here.

161
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,670
你别走!
Don't you walk away from me!

162
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,940
去你的!
Hey fuck you!

163
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,410
别耍聪明  你叫什么名字?
Oh you're a clever one. What's your name?

164
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,670
我的天
Oh my God.

165
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,780
好像是对的
Looks right.

166
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,800
要多智障才会被开除?
Will how retarded do you gotta be to get fired from that job?

167
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,630
在屋子里扫地有那么难吗?
I mean how hard is it to push a motherfuckin' broom around?

168
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,070
你连扫地都会被开除
Mitch you got fired from pushin' a fuckin' broom.

169
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,170
那是因为管理阶层重组
I got fired 'cause management was restructuring.

170
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,710
对  重组智障儿的数量
Yeah restructuring the amount of retards they had workin' for 'em.

171
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,520
闭嘴  你被开除的次数更多
Shut up. You get canned more than tuna bitch.

172
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,750
起码现在我有工作
At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now don't I?

173
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,480
是啊
Yeah.

174
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,510
威尔  你为何被开除?
Why'd you get fired Will? Come on.

175
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,920
管理阶级重组
Management was restructuring.

176
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,620
我舅舅或许能给你工作
My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.

177
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,490
可以吗?
Can he do that?

178
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,230
你耍我  我昨天还问过你
You kiddin' me! I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.

179
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,160
我昨天告诉你不行
And I told you "no" yesterday.

180
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,820
怎么样?  盖斯
- What's up Casey?  - What's up Case?  - What's up Big Case?

181
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,390
坐这边
Let's sit over here.

182
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,380
这就是哈佛酒吧?
Oh this is...this is a Harvard bar huh?

183
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,240
我以为墙上会有方程式呢
I thought there'd be like equations and shit on the wall.

184
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,120
我要一壶店里最好的啤酒
I will take a pitcher of the finest lager in the house.

185
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,560
暂停
Timeout.

186
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,330
我要去泡吧台的哈佛辣妹
I'm gonna have to bust a little move on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

187
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,040
- 看我的吧  - 帮我们钓几个
- Work some magic.  - Get some potion for us.

188
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,230
- 你好  - 你好
- Oh hello.  - Oh hello.

189
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,390
你好吗?
Hi. How are ya?

190
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,260
好
Fine.

191
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,990
两位美女...
So do you ladies uh...

192
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,650
常来吗?
Come here often?

193
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,090
我常来吗?  我...
Do I come here? I come here a bit.

194
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
偶尔来
I'm here you know from time to time.

195
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,630
你们在这儿念书
Do you go to school here?

196
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,670
对
Yep.

197
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,500
就是嘛  我想我跟你同班
Yeah that's it. I think I had a class with you.

198
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,770
是吗?  哪一班?
Oh yeah. What class?

199
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,780
历史
History.

200
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,500
或许
Maybe.

201
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,650
应该没错
Yes I think that's what it was.

202
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,320
你可能不认识我  我来这边来
You don't necessarily...may not remember me. You know I like it here.

203
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,950
并不表示我是天才  但我还是很聪明
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here I'm a genius. I am very smart.

204
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,460
你好吗?
Hey how's it goin'? How are ya?

205
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,110
好  你呢?
Good. How ya doin'?

206
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,990
你说你在哪一班?
What class did you say that was?

207
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,930
历史
History.

208
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,730
历史?  那一定是概论课程
Just history? It must have been a survey course then.

209
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,030
- 对  是概论课程  - 没错
Yeah it was. It was surveys.  - Right.

210
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,000
你应该上上看  不错的课
You should check it out. It's a good course. It'd be a good class.

211
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,530
你觉得那堂课怎么样?
How'd you like that course?

212
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,540
老实说  我觉得很基础
You know frankly I found that class you know rather elementary.

213
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,510
基础
Elementary.

214
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,110
肯定是的
You know I don't doubt that it was.

215
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,140
我记得那堂课了
I uh I remember that class.

216
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,120
就在休息和午餐之间
It was um... It was just between recess and lunch.

217
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,550
克拉克  你走开啦
Clark why don't you go away?

218
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,860
放轻松点
Why don't you relax?

219
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,890
走开啦
Why don't you go away?

220
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,580
我跟我的新朋友很开心
I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.

221
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,030
有什么问题吗?
Are we gonna have a problem?

222
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,960
没问题
No no no no. There's no problem here.

223
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,000
只是想请教你对于市场经济...
I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution...

224
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,800
在南部殖民地发展的看法
of the market economy in the southern colonies.

225
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,660
我主张在革命战争前...
My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War...

226
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,740
南方殖民地的经济形态...
the economic modalities especially in the southern colonies...

227
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,550
最适切被刻画为...
could most aptly be characterized as...

228
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,780
- 农地  - 让我来说两句
- agrarian precapitalist.  - Let me tell you somethin'.

229
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,930
那当然是你的论点  新生嘛
Of course that's your contention. You're a first- year grad student.

230
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,150
才刚念完马克斯主义
You just got finished readin' some Marxian historian... Pete Garrison probably...

231
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,430
下个月念到雷蒙的论点你会更深信不疑
You're gonna be convinced of that till next month when you get to James Lemon.

232
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,560
然后你会谈到维吉尼亚州及宾州...
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

233
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,770
在1740年如何企业化与资本主义化...
were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740.

234
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,070
一直持续到明年你反刍伍德...
That's gonna last until next year. You're gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

235
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,930
大谈革命前乌托邦...
talkin' about you know the prerevolutionary utopia...

236
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,870
和军事动员对资本形成的影响
and the capital- forming effects of military mobilization.

237
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,780
事实上我反对这个观点
Well as a matter of fact I won't.

238
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,170
因为伍德完全低估了社会...
Because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

239
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,210
伍德低估了财富的社会差异...
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

240
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,710
尤其是继承财富
predicated upon wealth especially inherited wealth.

241
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,050
这是你从维克斯读到的论点
You got that from Vickers

242
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,410
艾群就业分析  98页  对不对?
Work in Essex County. Page 98 right?

243
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,950
我也读过
I read that too.

244
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,790
你要剽窃整本书吗?
Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us?

245
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,620
对这些论点你有个人想法吗?
Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter?

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,460
你跑到酒吧来高谈书中的论点
Or is that your thing? You come into a bar. You read some obscure passage.

247
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,770
还假装是自己的观点
Then pretend... pawn it off as your own.

248
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,360
就为了泡妞  糗我朋友吗?
As your own idea just to impress some girls? Embarrass my friend?

249
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
你的可悲是在五十年后
See the sad thing about a guy like you is in 50 years

250
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,310
你才会开始了解
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

251
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,350
生命中有两件事是确定的
You're gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life.

252
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,580
一是别只会打高空
One: Don't do that.

253
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,420
二是你花一万五所受的教育...
And two: You dropped 150 grand on a fuckin' education...

254
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
用一块五就能在图书馆得到
you could've got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library.

255
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,690
对  但我会有文凭
Yeah but I will have a degree.

256
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,260
你却只能在我去滑雪胜地途中...
And you'll be servin' my kids fries at a drive...

257
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,730
卖薯条给我的小孩
through on our way to a skiing trip.

258
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,180
或许吧  起码我不会抄袭逼别人的
Maybe but at least I won't be unoriginal.

259
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,850
不爽可以到外面解决
If you have a problem with that we could step outside. We could figure it out.

260
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:51,230
不  没事  很酷
No man there's no problem. It's cool.

261
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,110
酷?
It's cool?

262
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,050
你他妈的酷毙了
Damn right it's cool.

263
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,070
现在喜欢我了吧
How do you like me now?

264
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,380
那小子聪明绝顶
My boy's wicked smart.

265
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,560
才来三分钟就摆平一个傻蛋
I just spent three minutes in this fuckin' place and run into a barney huh?

266
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,880
我来  有了
There it is.

267
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,670
- 吉米  你好  - 她们可真棒
- Nice to meet you.  - They were fine man.

268
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,170
我们差点就要把到她们  结果比利触怒她们
I was gonna close the deal but then Chuck...Billy insulted one of 'em...

269
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,340
辣妹就说我头快秃了  又太胖
The heavyset girl said I had a receding hairline and I was a few pounds overweight.

270
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,770
我就说"去你妈的"
And I was like "Go fuck yourself."

271
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,840
我什么都没说
I swallowed a bug.

272
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,920
你是个白痴
You're an idiot.

273
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,380
什么
What?

274
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,580
你是个白痴
You're an idiot.

275
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,770
我坐在那边整整45分钟...
I've been sitting over there for 45 minutes...

276
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,790
等你过来搭讪
waiting for you to come and talk to me.

277
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,330
但我累了  我得回家了
But I'm tired now and I have to go home.

278
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,020
我不能再坐着等你
I couldn't sit there anymore waiting for you.

279
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,160
我是威尔
I'm Will.

280
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,100
史凯兰
Skylar.

281
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
- 史凯兰  - 对了
- Skylar.  - Oh and by the way

282
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,410
那个人  迈可波顿二号
that guy over there... Michael Bolton clone...

283
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
跟我们不是一国的
He wasn't sitting with us so to speak.

284
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,370
- 我知道  我看得出来  - 那就好
- I know. I kinda got that impression.  - Good. Okay.

285
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,810
我得走了
Well I've got to go.

286
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,840
我要早起花钱买文凭
Gotta get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.

287
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,510
我不是指你
No I didn't mean you.

288
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,550
没关系
That's all right.

289
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,060
这是我的电话  也许有空可以喝杯咖啡
There's my number. Maybe we can go out for coffee sometime.

290
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,120
好  或许聚在一起吃焦糖
All right yeah. Maybe we can just get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

291
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,850
什么意思?
What do you mean?

292
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,030
那和喝咖啡一样惬意
When you think about it it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

293
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,900
是吗
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

294
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
好的
Uh right then.

295
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,880
Yo!
兄弟们!

296
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,140
- 去你的!  - 我才去你的
- Fuck you bitch!  - Fuck you.

297
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,370
那些傻旁谀潜
There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with his skiin' trip.

298
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,880
等等
Hold on.

299
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,710
我们应该扁那个混蛋
We should've beat that old bitch's ass.

300
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,050
你喜欢青苹果甜甜圈吗?
Do you like apples?

301
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,460
- 是的  - 喜欢?
- Yeah.  - Yeah?

302
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,340
我得到她的电话
Well I got her number!

303
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,940
你却只能吃甜甜圈
How do you like them apples?

304
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,280
来
Come.

305
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,860
打扰了  这是大楼管理室吗?
Excuse me? Is this the Buildings and Grounds office?

306
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,800
有何贵干
Yeah. What can I do for you?

307
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,160
我要找个在这里打工的学生
I just need the name of a student who works here.

308
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,740
没学生替我做事
No students work for me.

309
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,000
请你查一下
Could you please check?

310
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,370
有个人在我那栋楼做事  大概长这么高
I have this guy who works in my building. He's about this high.

311
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,100
你在几号楼?
Which one is your building?

312
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,700
- 二  - 二号楼
- Two.  - Two. Building two.

313
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,810
如果有东西失窃我该知道
Look if anything was stolen I should know about it.

314
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,900
不是那样
No it's nothing like that.

315
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,860
我只是要找他
I just need his name.

316
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,350
除非你投诉  否则不告诉你
I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.

317
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,290
这位是蓝勃教授
This is Professor Lambeau.

318
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,020
这位是海斯教授
And this is Professor Hayes.

319
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,360
汤姆  拜托
Tom please.

320
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,530
这很重要  拜托
This is important. Please.

321
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,030
威尔今天没上班
Will didn't show for work today.

322
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,680
他透过PO找到这份工作  你可以打给他
Got this job through his P.O. You can call him.

323
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,710
P.O.?

324
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,240
对  观护人
Yeah. Parole officer.

325
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,220
谢谢
Thank you.

326
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,080
混蛋
Asshole.

327
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,530
法官先生  这溯及1789年的司法判例
There is a lengthy legal precedent Your Honor going back to 1789

328
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,230
被告可对政府单位要求自卫权
whereby a defendant can claim self- defense against an agent of the government...

329
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,000
如果该举动是为保护自由  抗拒暴政制裁的话
if that act is deemed a defense against tyranny a defense of liberty.

330
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,580
法官先生  比彻尔在1887年说过
Your Honor Henry Ward Beecher in Proverbs from the Plymouth Pulpit 1887 said quote...

331
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,450
- 1887?  现在20世纪了  - 抱歉
- 1887? This is the 20th century.  - Excuse me. Excuse me.

332
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,610
他在嘲弄法庭
He's gonna make a mockery.

333
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,080
宪法赋与我为自己辩护之权
I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense sir.

334
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,880
同时宪法还赋予我自由的权力
By the Constitution of the United States. This guarantees my liberty.

335
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,620
不用你教我宪法条例
Don't tell me about the Constitution.

336
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,420
自由是一个人呼吸的权利
"Liberty  " in case you've forgotten is a soul's right to breathe.

337
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,860
无法让人呼吸的法律太严肃
When it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight.

338
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,430
不自由  人就是行尸走肉
Without liberty man is a syncope.

339
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,310
什么?
Man is a what?

340
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,100
出处同前  法官先生
Ibid. Your Honor.

341
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,570
轮到我  我在这坐了十分钟...
Son my turn. I've been sitting here for ten minutes...

342
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,970
看着你的罪状  我不敢相信
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours. I just can't believe it.

343
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,490
93年6月  9月故意伤害
June '93 assault. September '93 assault.

344
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,200
偷车  94年2月
Grand theft auto February of '94.

345
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,480
你引述  马与马车的财产权
Where apparently you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing...

346
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,790
并以自我辩护让此案驳回
"free property rights of horse and carriage" from 1798.

347
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,380
真可笑  95年1月  扮成警察
Joke. January '95 impersonating an officer.

348
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,390
伤害  窃盗  拒捕  全驳回
Mayhem theft resisting. All overturned.

349
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,820
我知道你住过几个寄养家庭
I'm also aware that you've been through several foster homes.

350
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,500
因受虐而从其中三个搬出
The state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse.

351
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,910
别的法官是关心你
You know another judge might care.

352
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,570
但你打警察  就得坐牢
But you hit a cop. You're going in.

353
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,520
不准提出抗告  保释金五万
Motion to dismiss is denied. $50  000 bail.

354
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,230
谢谢
Thank you.

355
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,860
起立
Rise.

356
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,880
喂?
Hello?

357
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,710
史凯兰?
Uh Skylar?

358
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,610
我是威尔
Hey uh it's Will.

359
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,550
- 谁?  - 威尔
- Who?  - It's Will.

360
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,430
你前两天在酒吧碰到的帅哥
You know the really funny good- looking guy you met at the bar the other night.

361
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,120
我不记得有碰到这样的人
I don't recall meeting anyone who matches that description. I think I'd remember.

362
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,760
好吧  是那个丑陋无比又没牙...
Oh all right you got me. It's the ugly obnoxious toothless loser...

363
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,960
还整夜缠着你不放的废物
who got hammered and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

364
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,130
威尔!  我记起来了
Oh Will! I remember.

365
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,770
你好  我还在想你会不会打来
How are you? I was wondering if you'd call me.

366
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,210
我一直在想...
Yeah look I was wondering...

367
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,200
怎么样?  宝贝
Yo what's up baby?

368
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,870
稍等
Hold on one second.

369
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,470
怎样?  宝贝  想上我吗?
What you doing? Want some of my ass?

370
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,780
赫芙  我记得你  在少年监狱见过  你好吗?
Herve I remember you from juvi. How you doing?

371
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,440
干嘛?  去你的
What you doing?

372
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,560
对不起
Oh yeah sorry about that.

373
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,460
我在想...也许这礼拜可以聚一聚
I was wonderin' maybe we could get together sometime this week.

374
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,960
坐在咖啡座吃点焦糖
Sit out at a cafe. Maybe have some caramels.

375
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,320
听起来很棒
Oh that sounds wonderful.

376
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,290
可以吗?
Yeah?

377
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,230
可以  你在哪里?
Yeah sure. Where are you?

378
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,300
我站的地方有点糟...
Uh well actually this is just a shot in the dark...

379
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,700
你那儿总不会是看守所吧
but uh there's no chance that you're pre- law is there?

380
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,780
坐
Have a seat.

381
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,010
谢谢
Thank you.

382
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,970
很高兴跟你讲话
Nice talking to ya.

383
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,510
你他妈的想干嘛?
What the fuck do you want?

384
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
我是杰洛蓝勃
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

385
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,650
你叫他滚蛋的那个教授
Professor you told to fuck himself.

386
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,090
找我干嘛?
Well what the fuck do you want?

387
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,160
我跟法官谈过
I've spoken to the judge.

388
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,030
他同意在我监护之下  放你出去
And he's agreed to release you under my supervision.

389
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,570
真的?
Really?

390
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,370
是的
Yeah.

391
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,010
但有两个条件
Under two conditions.

392
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,940
哪两个?
What are those?

393
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,370
第一  你每周要跟我碰面
First condition is that you meet with me every week.

394
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,680
做什么?
What for?

395
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,350
和你讨论数学
Go over the proof you're working on.

396
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:19,340
看你做些更高级的...组合数学
Get into some more advanced...combinatorial mathematics.

397
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,330
有限数学
Finite math.

398
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,760
好像很有趣
Sounds like a real hoot.

399
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,570
第二  你要看心理医生
And the second condition is that...that you see a therapist.

400
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,780
由我每周负责作评估报告
I'm responsible to submit reports on those meetings.

401
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,140
如果你不及格...
If you fail to meet with any of those conditions...

402
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
照样送你回来坐牢
you will have to serve time.

403
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,590
好  数学我接受  但我不看去他妈的心理医生
All right. I'll do the math but I'm not gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

404
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,380
这总比蹲牢房好  不是吗?
It's better than spending that time in jail isn't it?

405
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,980
我看过你的书
I read your book.

406
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,130
你提到有个病人麦克的问题...
And "Mike" was havin' the same problems...

407
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,560
事实上和证券营业员查克一样
that "Chad  " the stockbroker was havin'.

408
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,660
说得很准  很好
Absolutely right. Right on the button. Good for you Will.

409
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,270
非常好

威尔  有关压力...

我不是武断地贴你标签

413
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,590
但它破坏了你的潜力
But they are destroying your potential.

414

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,480
要摆脱不容易  来  多讲点
You're not gonna get off that easily. Come on Will. A bit more.

我有做过一些事
Well I mean I do do things you know?

419
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,790
哪种事?

420
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,300
我做过...你知道...我躲避人群
I do things that you know I mean I hide from people.

421
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,890
你躲避?
You hide do you?

422
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,400
不  我也去一些地方交朋友
No no. I mean I like... I go places. I interact.

423
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,730
真的?  哪种地方
Really? What sort of places?

424
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,810
一些酒吧
Just certain clubs.

425
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,770
再来  很好  哪种酒吧?
More. That's nice. Yes. What sort of clubs?

426
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,210
像是"幻想"
Like uh like Fantasy.

427
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,650
还不错的地方
Fantasy.

428
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,910
好  说下去
that's nice. A bit more.

429
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,910
一进去整个人就被音乐包围
It's something like when you get in there the music like owns you.

430
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,460
浩势音乐  砰...
It's like that house music. It's like...Bom- bom- bom

431
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,820
你就会开始跳舞...
You know you start dancin'. It's just...

432
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,970
是的
Yes.

433
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,360
隐瞒你是同性恋很难吗?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?

434
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,110
你在说什么?
What are you talking about? What?

435
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,310
兄弟
Look buddy.

436
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,070
两秒前你准备扑向我
Two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.

437
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,080
扑?  你...
A jump? Are you...

438
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,440
很抱歉让你失望了  威尔
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.

439
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,570
没关系  我不在乎你从后面上
Hey I don't have a problem with it. I don't care if you putt from the rough.

440
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,250
从后面上你?  你在讲什么?
What are you...P...Putting from the rough? What on earth are you talking about?

441
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:43,230
困难的定理就像性感的交响曲
A difficult theorem could be like a symphony. It's very erotic.

442
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,360
你找别人  我应付不来
You go somewhere else. I can't handle this.

443
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,700
亨利
Thank you Henry.

444
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,140
我不能再做这种公众服务
Hi Gerry. You know something? I can't do this pro bono work anymore.

445
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,010
不值得
It's just not...It's not worth it.

446
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,080
怎么了?
What happened?

447
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,110
我要上电视
Well I'm going on national television next week.

448
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,010
没空告诉你  更别提这个胡言乱语的疯子
I mean I haven't got time to tell you much less talk to that raving looney in there.

449
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,590
他肯定是疯了
An absolute lunatic he is.

450
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,640
亨利

是个人形  在我头上盘旋
It's like a...It's a figure. It's hoverin' over me.

458

461
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,990
摸我那下面
It's touching me down there

462
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,490
我很紧张
And I'm nervous.

463
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,020
不必紧张
You don't have to be nervous Will.

464
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:58,010
我们开始跳舞  好美
We start dancin' and dancin'. It's just beautiful.

465
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:05,670
因为日落前可以做爱
'cause we can make a lot of love before the sun goes down.

466
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,840
烟火飞舞
Skyrockets in flight

467

看在老天份上  威尔

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,130
干嘛?  他走了不能怪我
What? Oh come on. He left. You can't pin that on me.

476
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,030
你得跟这些人合作

你想怎么做?
What do you want to do?

485

有个人
Well there's someone.

486
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,260
是谁?
Who is he?

487
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:04,300
他是我大学室友
He used to be my uh... my roommate in college.

488
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,270
信任

489

在感情上和临床上都很重要
It's also very important in a clinical situation.

490
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,880
为何信任对于突破患者心防...

491
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,320

No.

498
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,270
若病患不信任你
If a patient doesn't feel safe enough trust you.

499
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,230
就不会坦诚相对
Then they won't be honest with you.

500
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,480
治疗对他们来说就毫无意义
Then there's really no point for them being in therapy.

501
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,620
不信任你就不会跟你上床
I mean hey if they don't trust you you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

502
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,650
那该是心理医生的最终目的
That should be the goal of any good therapist.

趁脆弱时下手  我的座右铭

- 你呢  先生?  - 一点就好
- You sir?  - Just a little.

549
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,750
但他偶然发现一本旧数学课本
But he came across this old math book

550
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,290
却发明难倒数学家已久的理论
and from the simple text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years.

551
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,520
对  连续分数  他是以...
Yes. Continued fractions. He wrote uh...

- Well he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.  - Yeah Cambridge. Yeah.

553
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,560
哈帝即刻了解那是天才之作

554
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,270
把他带到英国

559
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,880
但他有点防御性
But he's...he's a bit defensive.

560
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,950
我需要有人突破他的心防
I need someone who can get through to him.

561
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,660
像是我

Why?

564
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,890
因为你们有相同背景
Well because you have the same kind of background.

565
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,960
什么背景?
What background?

566
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,500
你们来自同一个区
Well you're from the same neighborhood.

567
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,030
他是南区人?
He's from Southie?

568
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,290
是的
Yeah.

南区的天才少年
Boy genius from Southie.

570
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,740
你之前找过几个心理医生?
How many shrinks you go to before me?

571
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,640
五个
Five.

572
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,010
让我猜  拜瑞  亨利  没找瑞克吧
Let me guess. Barry? Henry? Not Rick?

573
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,270
拜托  请跟他碰面  一周一次就好
Sean please just meet with him once a week.

拜托?
Please?

575
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,360
这就像打牌  别让牌泄底
It's a poker game with this kid. Don't let him know what you've got.

576
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,230
他或许已看过你的书
He probably even read your book if he could find it.

577
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,960
他要找到很难
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

578
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,830
威尔

你好吗?
How are you?

589
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,490
你是南区哪里人?
Where you from in Southie?

590
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,690
我喜欢你这边的装潢
I like what you've done with the place.

谢谢
Oh thanks.

592
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,490
这些书都是零买的...
Do you buy all these books retail...

593
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,580
还是派人买的整套心理丛书?
or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?

594
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,740
你喜欢看书?

这些书你读过吗?
Did you read any of these books?

597
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,480
不知道
I don't know.

598
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,400
那些书呢
How about any of these books?

599
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,450

很好  你有什么感想?
Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

603
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,780
我不是他妈的来做读书报告
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.

604
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,330
那是你的书  你怎么不读
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

605
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,930
我读过  非读不可
I did. I had to.

606
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,300
一定花了你不少时间
Must've taken you a long time.

607
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,360
是的
Yeah it did.

608
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,580
美国通史  第一册
United States of America: A Complete History Volume l.

609
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,050
天哪  想看真的历史的话
Jesus. If you wanna read a real history book

610
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,150
应该读辛恩的书
read Howard Zinn's A People's History in the United States.

611
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,090
那本书会让你大吃一惊
That book'll fuckin' knock you on your ass.

612
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,090
比琼姆斯基的书更好吗?
Better than Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent?

613
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,500
你觉得那是本好书?
Do you think that's a good book?

614
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,010
我搞不懂你们这些人  他妈的
You fuckin' people baffle me.

615
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,584
把钱都花在这些可笑的书上
You spend all your money on these fuckin' fancy books.

616
00:39:10,584 --> 00:39:14,940
浪费在不对的书上面
You surround yourselves with 'em. They're the wrong fuckin' books.

617
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,810
什么是他妈的对的书?
What are the right fuckin' books Will?

618

让头发竖起来的
Whatever blows your hair back.

619
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,650
我剩的头发不多
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

620
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,750
你为什么不把烟戒了
Hey you know you'd be better shoving that cigarette up your ass.

621
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,750
对你的健康有好处
It'd probably be healthier for you.

622
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,160
我知道  抽烟妨碍我练瑜珈
Yeah I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.

623
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,950

624
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,780

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,720
对
Yeah.

626
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,890
举重机?
Nautilus?

627
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,030
不  哑铃
No free weights.

628
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,960
真的?
Oh really?

629
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,860
哑铃?
Free weights huh?

630
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,360
对  很行
Yeah. Yeah big time. Just like that.

631
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,400
你举多少?
What do you bench?

632
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,830
285  你呢?
285. What do you bench?

633

喜欢音乐吗?
Do you like music?

640
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,110
真烂
This is a real piece of shit.

641
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,780
告诉我你觉得怎么样
Oh tell me what you really think.

642
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,420
线条结构复杂混乱
Just the linear and impressionistic mix makes a very muddled composition.

643
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,490
笔法颇有印象派画风
It's also a Winslow Homer rip- off except you got whitey rowin' the boat there.

644
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,490
那倒怪了  我并不想模仿莫奈
Well it's art Monet. It wasn't very good.

645
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,070
我在意的不是那个
That's not really what concerns me though.

646
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,220
你在意什么?
What concerns you?

647
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,100
色彩
Just the coloring.

648
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,870
你知道吗?
You know what the real bitch of it is?

649
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,940
这是以数字画的
It's paint- by- number.

650
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,500
以数字上色?  至少这色彩让我着迷
Is it color- by- number? Because the colors are fascinating to me.

651
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,130
真的?  色彩怎样?
Aren't they really?

652
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,210
我想你差点就要割耳朵了
You bet. I think you're about one step away from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

653
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,140
真的?
Really?

654
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,300
没错
Oh yeah.

655
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,210
那我应该搬到法国改名梵谷
Think I should move to the south of France change my name to "Vincent".

656
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,290
听过"暴风雨中的港口"吗?
You ever heard the sayin' "any port in a storm"?

657
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,980
听过
Yeah.

658
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,460
也许指的就是你
Yeah maybe that means you.

659
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,550
哪方面?
In what way?

660
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,450
也许你正在暴风雨中
Maybe you're in the middle of a storm a big fuckin' storm.

661
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,160
也许吧
Yeah maybe.

662
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,690
天色昏暗  海浪撞击小船
The sky's fallin' on your head. The waves are crashin' over your little boat.

663
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,570
桨就要断了
The oars are about to snap.

664
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,970
你吓坏了  迫切需要港口
You just piss in your pants. You're cryin' for the harbor.

665
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,210
这是你成为心理医生的原因
So maybe you do what you gotta do to get out. You know maybe you became a psychologist.

666
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,940
答对了  就是这样
Bingo. That's it.

667
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,230
让我做事吧  你妨碍我了
Let me do my job now. You start with me. Come on.

668
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,710
也许你娶错女人
Maybe you married the wrong woman.

669
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,250
也许你讲话该小心点
Maybe you should watch your mouth.

670
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,410
小心点  好吗?
Watch it right there chief all right?

671
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,600
没错  你娶错女人了
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman.

672
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,060
发生什么事?
What happened?

673
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,540
她抛弃你了?
What did she leave you?

674
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,040
她是不是搞上别的男人?
Was she you know...banging some other guy?

675
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,240
再对我太太无礼就宰了你
If you ever disrespect my wife again I will end you.

676
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,010
我会他妈的宰了你
I will fuckin' end you.

677

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,330
如果你不再想见他  我了解
Look I'll understand if you don't wanna meet with him again.

683

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,270
真漂亮
They're just beautiful.

689
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,350
我一直想擦蓝色眼影
Yes I always wanted dark blue eye shadow.

690
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,940
美极了
Wonderful.

691
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,030
我在英国长大  念好学校
Growing up in England you know I went to a very nice school.

692
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,450
就是那种积极  有组织...
You know it was kind of progressive organic...

693
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,410
又独立自主的私立学校
do- it- yourself private school.

694
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:56,870
然后是很有钱途的哈佛医学院
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

695
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,790
你知道我发现什么?
You know I figured out

696
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,250
最后我的脑子  会价值25万美金
by the end my brain's gonna be worth $250  000.

697
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,540
听起来很可怕吧
That sounded horrible didn't it?

698
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,680
再来一杯"迈泰"
Bring me another mai tai!

699
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,850
酷  你父母一定很乐于付钱
Yeah that's cool. I mean I bet your parents were happy to pay.

700
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,510
错  我自己付  我继承了遗产
No I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.

701
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,550
那么钱都给哈佛吗?
Wow. Is Harvard gettin' all that money?

702
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,620
不  斯坦福  毕业后过去
No Stanford. I'm going there in June when I graduate.

703
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,890
所以你只是想利用这个水手
All right so you just wanted to use this sailor and then run away huh?

704
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,530
我要先拿你做解剖实验
I was gonna you know experiment on you for anatomy class first obviously.

705
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,160
这样的话  好吧
In that case that's fine.

706
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,370
想看我变魔术吗?
Hey you wanna see my magic tricks Skylar?

707
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,330
好啊
Of course.

708
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,380
好  保证...
All right. Promise to...

709
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,710
好的
All right.

710
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,770
这是给你的  鲁道夫
This one's for you Rudolph.

711
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,780
等等  你需要我的魔杖
Wait wait. You need my wand.

712
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,110
好  敲一下
All right give me a hit. Thank you. All right.

713
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,390
谢谢  让这些焦糖消失
I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.

714
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,080
准备好了吗?
You ready? Ready.

715
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:58,010
一 二 三
One two three.

716
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,150
全不见了
They're all gone.

717
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,810
有兔子会比较成功
That was my...It works better when I have my rabbit.

718
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,500
我不常约会
I don't really date you know that much.

719
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,590
真可惜  我...
How very unfortunate... I think for me.

720
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,680
你懂我意思  我知道你在想什么
You know what I mean? I know you've been thinking about it.

721
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,470
- 我没有  - 我知道你有
- Oh no I haven't.  - Yes you have.

722
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,870
真的没有
No I really haven't.

723
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,880
你有  你想要睡前一吻
Yes you have. You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

724
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,790
不  我想要睡前一炮
No you know I tell ya I was hopin' to get a good night laid.

725
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,650
我愿意勉强接受一吻
But I'll settle for like a kiss you know?

726
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,480
你很高尚
How very noble of you.

727
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,520
谢谢
Thank you.

728
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,620
不  我真的想要一吻
No I was...I was hopin' for a kiss.

729
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,200
何不现在就解决?
Well why don't we just get it out of the way now?

730
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:43,830
现在?
Right now?

731
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,150
对  来
Yeah. Come on.

732
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,490
我吃到你的酸黄瓜了
I think I got some of your pickle.

733
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,470
又是你?
You again huh?

734
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,630
跟我来
Come with me.

735
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,140
现在要干嘛?
So what's this?

736
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,200
这是男人的行家选择?
A Taster's Choice moment between guys?

737
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,720
这里真不错
This is really nice.

738
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,740
你喜欢天鹅?  这算恋物癖吗?
You got a thing for swans? Is this like a fetish?

739
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,750
这是需要花点时间的事吗?
Is it something like maybe we need to devote some time to?

740
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,020
我在想你批评我画的事
Thought about what you said to me the other day. About my painting.

741
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,890
失眠大半夜的思索后
Stayed up half the night thinking about it.

742
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,670
突然我想到一件事
Something occurred to me.

743
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:52,360
接着就沉沉入睡
I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since.

744
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:53,760
你知道我当时想到什么吗?
You know what occurred to me?

745
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,040
不知道
No.

746
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,870
你只是个孩子
You're just a kid.

747
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,140
你根本不晓得你在说什么
You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.

748
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,180
谢谢  为什么?
Why thank you.

749
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,140
没关系
It's all right.

750
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,560
因你没离开过波士顿
You've never been out of Boston.

751
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,690
是没有
Nope.

752
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,620
所以问你艺术  你可能会...
So if I asked you about art you'd probably give me the skinny...

753
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,950
提出艺术书籍中的粗浅论调
on every art book ever written.

754
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,490
有关米开朗基罗  你知道很多
Michelangelo? You know a lot about him.

755
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:22,430
他的政治抱负  他和教皇...
Life's work political aspirations. Him and the pope...

756
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,730
性倾向  所有作品  对吗?
Sexual orientation. The whole works right?

757
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,700
但你不知道西斯汀教堂的气味
I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

758
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,610
你从没站在那儿观赏美丽的天花板
You never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

759
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,520
我看过
Seeing that.

760
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,780
如果我问关于女人的事
If I ask you about women.

761
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,750
你八成会说出个人偏好的谬论
you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites.

762
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:51,160
你可能上过几次床
You may have even been laid a few times.

763
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,260
但你说不出在女人身旁醒来...
But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman...

764
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,240
那种幸福的滋味
and feel truly happy.

765
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,370
你是个很倔的孩子
You're a tough kid.

766
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:13,440
问战争  你会说莎士比亚的话
I ask you about war you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me right?

767
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,950
"共赴战场  亲爱的朋友"
"Once more into the breach dear friends."

768
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,980
但你从没接近过战争
But you've never been near one.

769
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,830
从没把好友的头抱在膝盖上...
You've never held your best friend's head in your lap...

770
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,820
看着他吐出最后一口气
and watch him gasp his last breath lookin' to you for help.

771
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,030
问爱情  你会引述十四行诗
If I asked you about love you'd probably quote me a sonnet.

772
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,040
但你从没看过女人的脆弱
But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable.

773
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,440
她能以双眼击倒你
Known someone that could level you with her eyes.

774
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,510
感觉上帝让天使为你下凡
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth just for you.

775
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,320
她能从地狱将你拯救出来
Who could rescue you from the depths of hell.

776
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,320
你不了解成为她天使的滋味
And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.

777
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,090
拥有对她的爱直到永远
To have that love for her be there forever.

778
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,760
经历这一切  经历癌症
Through anything. Through cancer.

779
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,180
你无法体会在医院睡整整两个月  握着她的手
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand.

780
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,300
因为医生看到你的眼神就明白...
because the doctors could see in your eyes...

781
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,910
会客时间的规定对你无效
that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.

782
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,150
你不了解真正的失去
You don't know about real loss

783
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,200
唯有爱别人胜于自己才能体会
'cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself.

784
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,520
我怀疑你敢那样爱人
I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

785
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:32,060
看着你  我没看到聪明自信
I look at you. I don't see an intelligent confident man.

786
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,470
我看到被吓傻的狂妄孩子
I see a cocky scared shitless kid.

787
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,070
但你是天才  没人能否认
But you're a genius Will. No one denies that.

788
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,170
没人能了解你的深度
No one could possibly understand the depths of you.

789
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,910
但你看我的画就认定了解我
But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine.

790
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,780
你把我的人生撕裂了
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

791
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,780
你是孤儿  对吧?
You're an orphan right?

792
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:07,190
你想我觉得你日子有多苦...
Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard your life has been...

793
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,430
你的感受  你是谁...
how you feel who you are...

794
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,430
只是因为我看过孤雏泪吗?
because I read Oliver Twist?

795
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,500
太轻易认定你了吗?
Does that encapsulate you?

796
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,800
我不在乎  因为...
Personally I don't give a shit about all that because...

797
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,740
你知道吗?  我不能靠任何书籍认识你
You know what? I can't learn anything from you...I can't read in some fuckin' book.

798
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,390
除非你想谈自己  谈你是谁
Unless you wanna talk about you who you are.

799
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,790
那我就有兴趣了  我愿意加入
And I'm fascinated. I'm in.

800
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,430
但你不想那么做  对吗?
But you don't wanna do that do you sport?

801
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,600
你怕你会被说出来的话吓到
You're terrified of what you might say.

802
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,110
轮到你说了  大哥
Your move chief.

803
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,070
喂?
Hello? Hello?

804
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,990
喂?
Hello?

805
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,180
瓦兰帝教授  又是你吗?
Professor Valenti are you calling me again?

806
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:15,290
怪胎
Freak.

807
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,330
天哪  你打给谁?
Christ who did you call?

808
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,400
没有  我忘了号码
No one. I forgot the number.

809
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,370
你他妈智障?
You fuckin' retarded?

810
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,700
冒雨打电话  竟忘了号码
You went all the way out there in the rain and you didn't bring the number.

811
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,830
那是你妈的免费电话
No it was your mother's 900 number. I just ran out of quarters.

812
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,840
别扯上我妈  我刚上过你妈
Why don't we get off on mothers? I just got off yours.

813
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,950
很好笑  摩根  太炫了
That's pretty funny Morgan. That's a fuckin' nickel bitch.

814
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,950
- 继续跟我作对看看  - 好了
- Keep antagonizing me. Watch what happens.- All right then Morgan.

815
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,310
- 等着瞧  - 好了  摩根
- Watch what happens.- All right then Morgan.

816
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,360
再整我啊
Keep fuckin' with me.

817
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,660
不准抽烟
No smoking.

818
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,990
什么叫没讲话?  一个钟头
What do you mean he didn't talk? You were in there for an hour.

819
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:30,030
他就坐着等会谈结束
He just sat there counting the seconds until the session was over.

820
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,840
让人印象蛮深刻的
Pretty impressive actually.

821
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,100
他为什么要那么做?
Why would he do that?

822
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,000
证明他不想讲就不必讲
To prove to me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

823
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,340
这是小孩玩的瞪人比赛吗?
What is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood?

824
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,680
对  而且我不能先讲话
Yeah it is and I can't talk first.

825
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,050
我们知道你的理论  亚历山大
We know your theory Alexander.

826
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:49,610
但这孩子找出简单的几何图
But the boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

827
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,490
树状结构行不通
A tree structure won't work.

828
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:53,460
他把两个顶点连起来了
Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

829
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,580
但我算出总数
But I can do the sum.

830
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,490
那是集合项的方法
It's how you group the terms Alexander.

831
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,270
但是如果这样做...
But Gerry. If we do the whole thing this way then...

832
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:00,970
看这里
Hey look look.

833
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:06,600
我写下来了  这样比较简单
I wrote it down. It's simpler this way.

834
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,480
有些人就是走运
Sometimes people get lucky.

835
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,510
你是很聪明的人
You're a brilliant man.

836
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,920
我有一次搭飞机  坐在机上...
You know I was on this plane once and I'm sittin' there and...

837
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,930
机长广播完飞行于三万五千尺
the captain gets on he does his whole you know "we'll be cruisin' at 35000 feet  "

838
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,900
他放下麦克风后忘了关掉
But then he puts the mike down. He forgets to turn it off.

839
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,340
他转向副驾驶说...
So he turns to the copilot. He's like...

840
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,050
我现在很想要口交和咖啡
"You know all I could use right now is a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."

841
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,470
空服员冲去跟他说麦克风没关
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

842
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,810
机尾有个人说"别忘了带上咖啡"
This guy in the back of the plane's like "Hey hon don't forget the coffee."

843
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,400
你搭过飞机?
You ever been on a plane?

844
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,220
没有  那只是个笑话
No but it's a fuckin' joke.

845
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,880
用第一人称比较好笑
It works better if I tell it in the first person.

846
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,220
没错
Yeah it does.

847
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,830
我做过爱
I have been laid you know?

848
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,130
真的?  很好
Really? Good for you.

849
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,230
我很厉害
Big time big time.

850
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:45,960
很厉害?
Big time huh?

851
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,130
对  我上礼拜有约会
I went on a date last week.

852
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,440
怎么样?
How'd it go?

853
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,470
很好
It was good.

854
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,640
要再约会吗?
Goin' out again?

855
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,600
不知道
I don't know.

856
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:54,340
为什么?
Why not?

857
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,570
我没打给她
Haven't called her.

858
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,050
天哪  你真没用
Christ you're an amateur.

859
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,710
- 我知道我在干嘛  - 真的吗?
- I know what I'm doin'.  - Really?

860
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,480
放心  我知道我在干嘛
Yeah. Don't worry about me. I know what I'm doin'.

861
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,360
这女孩很漂亮  聪明风趣
Yeah but this girl was like you know beautiful. She's smart. She's fun.

862
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,730
她跟我以前认识的女生不一样
She's different from most of the girls I've been with.

863
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,160
那就打给她  罗密欧
So call her up Romeo.

864
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,650
让自己发现她没那么聪明吗?
Why so I can realize she's not that smart.

865
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,200
发现她其实很无聊吗?
That she's fuckin' boring? You know I mean you don't...

866
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,370
这女孩现在很完美
This girl's like fuckin' perfect right now.

867
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,610
我不想破坏
I don't wanna ruin that.

868
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,490
或许是你不想破坏你自己的完美
Maybe you're perfect right now. Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

869
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,580
我觉得那是极好的哲学
But I think that's a super philosophy Will.

870
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:33,460
这样可以一辈子不认识任何人
That way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody.

871
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,760
我太太一紧张就放屁
My wife used to fart when she was nervous.

872
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,760
她有各种奇妙的小特质
She had all sorts of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

873
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,950
你知道  她睡觉会放屁
You know she used to fart in her sleep.

874
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,430
抱歉跟你讲这种事
Just thought I'd share that with you.

875
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,140
有天晚上大声到把狗吵醒
One night it was so loud it woke the dog up.

876
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,610
她醒来说  是你吗  我说是
She woke up and gone like "Was that you?" I said "Yeah."

877
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:58,240
我不忍心告诉她  天哪
I didn't have the heart to tell her. Oh God.

878
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,830
她把自己臭醒?
She woke herself up?

879
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,170
是的
Yes.

880
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,960
天哪  她去世两年了
Oh Christ. But Will she's been dead two years

881
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,750
而那是我记得的事
And that's the shit I remember.

882
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,040
像那样的小事很奇妙
It's wonderful stuff you know? Little things like that.

883
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,050
那是我最想念的事
Yeah but those are the things I miss the most.

884
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:23,680
这些小特质让她成为我太太
Those little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about. That's what made her my wife.

885
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,140
她也知道我所有的小瑕疵
Boy and she had the goods on me too. She knew all my little peccadillos.

886
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:31,040
人们称之为不完美
People call these things "imperfections".

887
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,480
其实不然  那才是好东西
But they're not. That's the good stuff.

888
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,670
能选择让谁进入我们的世界
And then we get to choose who we let into our weird little worlds.

889
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
你并不完美
You're not perfect sport.

890
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,950
我不吊你胃口
And let me save you the suspense.

891
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,520
你认识的女生也不完美
This girl you met she isn't perfect either.

892
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:50,420
问题是你们是否完美地合适
But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other.

893
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,400
亲密关系就是这么回事
That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about.

894
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,760
你可以知道全世界的事
Now you can know everything in the world sport.

895
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,430
但发掘的方法就是去尝试
but the only way you're findin' out that one is by givin' it a shot.

896
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,370
你不能跟我这个糟老头学
You certainly won't learn from an old fucker like me.

897
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,310
就算我知道我也不告诉你
Even if I did know I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

898
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,350
为什么?
Yeah why not?

899
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,940
你其他事都告诉我了  天哪
You told me every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

900
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,120
你的话比任何心理医生都多
Fuckin' talk more than any shrink I ever seen in my life.

901
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,120
我只是教心理学  我说过我不是心理医生
I teach the shit. I didn't say I knew how to do it.

902
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,990
那么  你想过再婚吗?
You ever think about gettin' remarried?

903
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:30,540
我太太死了
My wife's dead.

904
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:32,900
所以才叫"再婚"
Hence the word "remarried."

905
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,100
她死了
She's dead.

906
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,710
我想那是极好的哲学
Yeah well I think that's a super philosophy Sean.

907
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:44,590
这样可以一辈子不认识任何人
I mean that way you can actually go through the rest of your life without ever really knowing anybody.

908
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,580
时间到了
Time's up.

909
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,930
别关
Hold it open.

910
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:06,770
谢谢
Thanks.

911
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,640
你去哪里了?
Where have you been?

912
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,280
对不起  我...我很忙
I'm sorry. I've been like...I've been really busy and...

913
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,950
我也是
Mmm. Me too.

914
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:55,120
我以为你会打来
Yeah. I...I thought you'd call.

915
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,280
我是说
I mean.

916
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,390
- 我们相处愉快  - 的确如此
- We had a really good time.  - I had a really good time too.

917
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:05,260
对不起我搞砸了
I mean I just...I...I'm sorry you know. I blew it.

918
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,510
不  没关系
No. No I mean you know it's all right.

919
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:13,070
你会不会再让我试一遍
Yeah um so I was wonderin' if uh if you know you'd give me another crack at it.

920
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,930
让我再约你出去
You know let me take you out again.

921
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,570
不行
I can't.

922
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,470
好吧
All right.

923
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,880
不  我不是永远不行
Oh no I didn't...I didn't mean I can't like ever.

924
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,810
现在不行
I just can't right now.

925
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,920
我得做质子光谱分配
I've got to assign the proton spectrum for "ebogamine".

926
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,680
听起来有趣  其实很无聊
All that sounds really really interesting. It's actually fantastically boring.

927
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,890
- 好吧  - 或许改天吧
- All right um...  - Maybe some other time.

928
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,150
那明天呢?
Like tomorrow?

929
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,590
好啊
Um yeah all right.

930
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,410
- 好的  - 好的
- Okay.  - Okay.

931
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,710
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye.  - Bye.

932
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,610
你在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

933
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,350
我等不到明天了
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

934
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:02,400
你从哪儿弄到这个?
Where the fuck did you get this?

935
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,620
我得跟你同学上床
I had to sleep with someone in your class.

936
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:09,060
希望是个穿拖鞋又有口臭的人
Oh I hope it was someone with the open- toed sandals and the really bad breath.

937
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,890
走  去找乐子
Come on. Let's go have some fun.

938
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,330
不行  我得念这个
No I've got to learn this.

939
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,160
你不会明天就要开刀吧
Well you're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?

940
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:18,300
不是
No.

941
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,080
走吧
Let's go.

942
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:26,590
我的天  我的狗赢了
Oh my God! My dog is winning!

943
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:30,650
加油  迷雾!  快跑!
Come on Misty! Come on! Run! Look at that! Come on!

944
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:34,310
他在那边  迷雾领先!
Look there he goes. Misty run! Come on!

945
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,120
我们赢了
We won.

946
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,750
它大获全胜
He totally won.

947
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,690
你在这边长大的吗?
So did you grow up around here then?

948
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,350
不远  南波士顿
Not far. South Boston.

949
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,270
赢了比赛让我脸好热
Still glowing from my win.

950
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,710
看你乐成这样
Look at you. You're so happy.

951
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:57,200
我的样子还好吧
And what was that like then?

952
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,910
很正常  没什么特别
It was normal I guess. Nothin' special.

953
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:04,170
你有很多兄弟姊妹吗?
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

954
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:07,530
- 我有很多兄弟姊妹吗?  - 我在问你呢
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?  - That's what I said.

955
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,420
我是个天主教徒  你说呢?
Well Irish Catholic what do you think?

956
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,100
对  几个?
Right. That's right. How many?

957
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,900
告诉你你也不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

958
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,730
为什么?  说啊  五个?

你知道他们的名字吗?
Do you know all their names?

964
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,950
当然知道  他们是我哥哥

威尔

976
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,780
你常和他们见面吗?
Do you still see all of them?

977
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,760
他们都住南区
Yeah well they all live in Southie.

978
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,810
我跟其中三个住
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

979
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,430
是吗?
Oh yeah?

980
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,420
我好想见他们
I'd like to meet them.

981
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,510
好  就去见他们
Yeah we'll do that.

982
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,980
我昨晚读过你的书
Oh you know I read your book last night.

983
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:09,570
原来是你
Oh so you're the one.

984
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,690
你还辅导退伍军人吗?
Do you still uh...Do you still counsel veterans?

985
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,290
没有
No I don't.

986
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:13,920
为什么?
Why not?

987
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,020
我太太生病时就没做了
Well I gave it up when my wife got sick.

988
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,240
你有没有想过若没遇见你太太
You ever wonder what your life would be like if you

989
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,230
你的生活会怎样?
uh if you never met your wife?

990
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,420
没有她会不会比较好?
What? Wonder if I'd be better off without her?

991
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:27,740
不  我没说比较好
No no no I'm not saying like better off.

992
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,770
我没那意思
I didn't mean it like that.

993
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,740
没关系  很重要的问题
It's all right. It's an important question.

994
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,010
是会有不好的时候...
'Cause you'll have bad times...

995
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,390
但那总是让你觉悟到好的事
But that'll always wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to.

996
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,010
你不后悔认识你太太?
And you don't regret meetin' your wife?

997
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,720
因为我现在的痛苦?
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

998
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:43,420
是有遗憾
Oh I got regrets Will.

999
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:46,590
但我不后悔跟她共度的每一天
But I don't regret a single day I spent with her.

1000
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,440
你几时知道她是理想对象?
So when did you know like that she was the one for you?

1001
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,160
1975年10月21日
October 21 1975.

1002
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,410
天哪  你他妈的记得日期?
Jesus Christ. You know the fuckin' day?

1003
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:03,810
对  那是世界大赛第六场
Oh yeah 'cause it was game six of the World Series.

1004
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,500
红袜队史上最重大的球赛
Biggest game in Red Sox history.

1005
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,450
没错
Yeah sure.

1006
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:09,670
我和朋友睡人行道排队买票
My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.

1007
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,150
你有票?
You got tickets?

1008
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,410
对  比赛当天...
Yep. Day of the game...

1009
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,760
我们坐在酒吧等球赛开始...
I was sittin' in a bar waitin' for the game to start...

1010
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,800
有个女孩走进来...
and in walks this girl...

1011
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,730
那是场很棒的球赛
It was an amazing game though.

1012
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,220
八局下半
You know bottom of the eighth Carbo ties it up.

1013
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,680
六比六平手
It was 6- 6.

1014
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,350
打到第十二局  下半场时
It went to 12. Bottom of the 12th.

1015
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:26,350
矮冬瓜菲克斯上场
in stepped Carlton Fisk old Pudge.

1016
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,440
他站上本垒  姿势很怪
Steps up to the plate. You know he's got that weird stance.

1017
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,190
打击出去!
And then...Boom! He clocks it you know.

1018
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,820
左外野高飞球!
High fly ball down the left field line!

1019
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,570
三万五千人站起来对球吼
Thirty- five thousand people on their feet yellin' at the ball.

1020
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,120
菲斯克像发了疯似地挥手说
But that's nothin' 'cause Fisk he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

1021
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,540
"飞过去!  飞过去!  飞过去!"
"Get over! Get over! Get over!"

1022
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,672
然后球飞到边界
Then it hits the foul pole. He goes ape- shit.

1023
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:50,310
三万五千名球迷冲到场上
And 35  000 fans...They charge the field you know.

1024
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:54,820
他大叫"大家让开  让开..."
Yeah and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way. "Get outta the way! Get outta the way!"

1025
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:57,280
我真不敢相信你有票!
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to that fuckin' game!

1026
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,550
你有冲到场上吗?
Did you rush the field?

1027
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,490
我没冲到场上  我不在场
No I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

1028
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:02,150
什么?
What?

1029
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,620
我跟我未来的老婆在喝酒
No I was in a bar havin' a drink with my future wife.

1030
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,390
你错过菲斯克的全垒打?
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run.

1031
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,150
对
Right.

1032
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,960
跟一个不认识的女人喝酒?
to have a fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

1033
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,460
对  你该看看她  令人惊艳
Yeah but you should have seen her. She was a stunner.

1034
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,590
我才不管他妈的...
I don't care if...

1035
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,860
她让整个屋子亮起来
Oh no no she lit up the room.

1036
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,370
- 哪怕是走进来的是海伦我也不在乎  - 你疯了!
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room.  - Oh Helen of Troy!

1037
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:20,480
天哪  那你朋友呢
That's game six! Oh my God and who were these friends of yours?

1038
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,740
- 就这么放过你?  - 他们没办法
- They let you get away with that?  - They had to.

1039
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,310
你跟他们怎么说?
What did you say to 'em?

1040
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,200
我把票滑过去说
I just slid my ticket across the table.

1041
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,290
抱歉  我要去找一个女孩
I said "Sorry guys. I gotta see about a girl."

1042
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:30,540
- 我要去找一个女孩?  - 对!
- "I gotta go see about a girl"?  - Yes!

1043
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,450
你那么说?
That's what you said?

1044
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:33,150
他们就放过你了?
They let you get away with that?

1045
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,880
对  他们看到我认真的眼睛
Oh yeah. They saw it in my eyes that I meant it.

1046
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,990
你耍我吧
You're kiddin' me?

1047
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,720
我没耍你
No I'm not kidding you Will.

1048
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,630
所以我现在不会因为...
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

1049
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,970
当年没和她说话而懊悔终生
and how I always regretted not goin' over and talkin' to her.

1050
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,220
我不后悔跟南茜结的18年
I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy.

1051
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,430
不后悔为她的病放弃辅导
I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick.

1052
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,200
不后悔那最后几年守着重病的她
And I don't regret the last years when she got really sick.

1053
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,860
更不会后悔错过球赛
And I sure as hell don't regret missin' a damn game.

1054
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,570
只是有点遗憾
That's regret.

1055
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,710
看到那场球赛还是不错的
Would have been nice to catch that game though.

1056
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:12,290
我不晓得矮冬瓜会红不让
I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit a home run.

1057
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:21,510
我在球场上很有用  我很高
You know I'm very very useful on the court. I'm extremely tall.

1058
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,130
你没那么高
You're not that tall.

1059
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,140
我会灌篮
I dunk.

1060
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:30,680
我能打NBA吗?
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

1061
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,070
绝对可以
"It is decidedly so." Hmph.

1062
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,940
为什么老是待在这边?
Why do we always stay here?

1063
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,280
因为比我家好
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

1064
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,520
但我从没去过你家
Yes but I've never seen your place.

1065
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,090
我知道
I know.

1066
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,490
我什么时候能见到你朋友和哥哥?
When am I gonna meet your friends and your brothers?

1067
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:52,960
他们不常来这里
Well they don't really come down here that much.

1068
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:55,250
我可以到南波士顿
I think I can make it to South Boston.

1069
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:59,470
有点远
It's kind of a hike.

1070
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:02,970
是我还是他们见不得人?
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?

1071
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,640
好  我们去
All right we'll go.

1072
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,640
几时?
When?

1073
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,100
不知道  下礼拜吧
I don't know. We'll go sometime next week.

1074
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:14,380
如不让我见他们就再也不跟你上床
What if I said I would not sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?

1075
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:22,560
清晨四点半  他们应该醒了
I'd say it's like 4:30 in the mornin'. They're probably up.

1076
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:26,320
天哪  男人真无耻
Oh my God. Men are shameless.

1077
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,340
你们男人就只会用小弟弟思考
If you're not thinking with your wiener then you're acting directly on its behalf.

1078
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:34,300
仅代表我的小弟弟向你预支
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener can I get an advance payment?

1079
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,400
不知道  我问问
I don't know. Let's ask.

1080
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,980
前途无量
"Outlook does not look good."

1081
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,050
- 什么?  - 干
- What?  - Fuck the...

1082
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,740
查克  没事  继续睡
Hey Chuck. No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

1083
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,930
你去打NBA才前途无量
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

1084
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:50,010
没错  所以你最好开始买季票
Exactly so look out. You'd better start buying some season tickets.

1085
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,940
我很高  我喜欢穿短裤
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall. I like wearing shorts.

1086
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,400
勾射  灌篮
Hook hook. Dunk dunk.

1087
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,620
你没那么高
You're not that tall.

1088

Yes I am. Maybe I'm all about three points.

1089

我就很会打"全垒打"
I'm all about home runs.

1090
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,740
别用运动术语影射
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

1091
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:24,690
妖精的老二在猴子屁眼里
A leprechaun's got his dick in the monkey's ass.

我们很难得一起喝酒
I know Morgan. It's a real rarity we'd be all drinkin'.

1095

My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go on a bender for six eight months.

1096
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,600
我讲过他被拦下来的事没?
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?

1097
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:46,070
我跟你们讲
I told you guys right? Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle Marty.

01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,300
我叔叔开车回家
My uncle Marty's drivin' home right?

1104
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,100
撞到树上
Bombed out of his tree right?

1105
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,050
他醉得一塌糊涂
Just hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

1106
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:14,510
州警把他拦下来  我叔叔惨了
This state trooper sees him pulls him over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

1107
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,540
州警要他下车走直线
Got him out of the car tryin' to make him walk the line.

1108
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,610
结果他吐在州警身上...
He gets out of the car pukes...

1109
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,510
州警确信他超过酒精浓度
and the statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

1110
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:24,480
正要把他戴上手铐送去坐牢
So he's about to throw the cuffs on him and put him in jail.

1111
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,990
突然五十码外一声他妈的巨响
All of a sudden 50 yards down the road there's this huge fuckin' boom.

1112
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,110
州警吓一大跳  转身
Statie gets real spooked. He turns around.

1113
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,090
枪声?
He got shot?

1114
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,490
不  是...
No. So...So...

1115
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,120
你听过这故事了
You heard this story before.

1116
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,040
得了  摩根
Yeah Morgan stop. Stop.

1117
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,540
是别人的车撞到树  出事了
Some other guy's car had hit a tree. There was an accident.

1118
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,400
总之...
Anyway...

1119
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,000
闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

1120
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,700

1121
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,800
闭嘴
Shut up!

1122
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,770
他跟你说过这故事了
He told you the story once before.

1123
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,280
州警跟我叔叔说"别走"
So he tells my uncle "Stay here. Don't move."

1124
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,350
就跑去处理另一起事故
Statie goes runnin' down the road to deal with the other accident.

1125
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:00,350
躺在尿和呕吐物中几分钟后...
After a few minutes of just lyin' in his own piss and vomit...

1126
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,600
我叔叔才想到  他在那儿干嘛
my uncle starts wonderin' what he's doin' there.

1127
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,390
于是站起来开车回家

他听到敲门声
He hears this knockin' at the door.

1130
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,960
下楼拉开门说"什么事"
So he goes downstairs pulls the door open "What?"

1131
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,660
是拦下他的州警
It's the state trooper that pulled him over.

1132
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,640
州警说"我操  什么事?  你明知故问"
Statie says "Fuck you mean 'What?' You know what."

1133
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,670
"我昨晚拦下你  你逃走了"
"I pulled you over last night is what and you took off."

1134
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,940
叔叔说"我这辈子没见过你"
He's like "l never seen you before in my life.

1136
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:29,670
州警说"别装蒜了  到车库"
He's like "You know who I am. Let me get in your garage."

1137
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,240
我叔叔说"什么?"
My uncle's like "What?" He said

1138
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,820
州警说"带我去你的车库"
"You heard me. Let me get in your garage."

1139
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,260
我叔叔带他到车库打开门
He was like "All right. Fine." Takes him out to the garage opens the door.

He was so fuckin'...He was so fuckin' hammered he drove the wrong car home.

1142
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:49,530
最诺氖侵菥好糗...
The best part about it is the fuckin' state trooper...

1143
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:51,990
他整晚什么都没做

1144
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:55,370
开着我叔叔的车挨家挨户找人
He'd been drivin' around all night in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

1145
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:59,450
你的故事重点是什么?

You don't want to rush to judgment on that one 'cause they're not all like me.

慢慢让开
Oh come on. Brother.

1183

你在干嘛?  你要送我们
I don't know what you're doin' dude. You're givin' us a ride.

1184
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,000
你以为我在干嘛?

I don't know what you're gettin' all serious about.

1188
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,230
你还是要先送我回家
You're droppin' me off first.

1189
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,180
这样很不顺路
It's really out of the way.

1190
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,260
别以为今晚可以外宿...
Oh okay. Just 'cause you don't have to sleep in your one- room palace tonight...

1191
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,420
就懦烧庋

1192
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,490
等一下  你说要去看你家

1195
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,390
他知道你一看过就会甩了他
He knows once you see that shit- hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

拜托  那是笑话嘛

不  沛绿雅

That's French for club soda.

1215
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,500
苏打水  好
Club soda yeah.

1216
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,600
还有几个三明治
Couple of sandwiches too.

1217
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:13,140
好
Sure.

1218
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,210
算在我帐上
Put it on my tab.

1219
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,970
你打算要签帐吗?
You ever plannin' on payin' your tab?

1220
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,320
要  我这边有中奖彩券
Yeah chief got the winning lottery ticket right here.

1221
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,780
奖金多少?
What's the jackpot?

1222
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,370
一千两百万
Twelve million.

1223
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,540
我看不够付
I don't think that'll cover it.

1224
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,810
够付你的变性手术了
It'll cover your sex change operation.

1225
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,290
坚果?
Nuts?

1226
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,620
不  谢谢
No thank you.

1227
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,630
你想谈威尔
So you wanted to talk about Will.

1228
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,600
好像很顺利
Well it seems to be going well.

1229
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,460
我想是的
I think so.

1230
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:45,170
你跟他谈过未来没?
Have you talked to him at all about his future?

1231
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,600
没谈到  还在往事中打转
No we haven't gotten into that yet. We're still bangin' away at the past.

1232
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,970
该开始谈了
Maybe you should.

1233
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:53,440
许多工作都急着找他
My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.

1234
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,520
哪种工作?
What kind?

1235
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,580
尖端科技数学  智囊团
Cutting edge mathematics think tanks.

1236
01:14:57,690 --> 01:15:00,350
威尔的头脑能发挥的地方
The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free rein.

1237
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:05,690
那真好  但他还没准备好
That's great that there are offers but I don't really think he's ready for that.

1238
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,330
我想你不明白
I'm not sure you understand Sean.

1239
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:15,040
我不明白什么?
What don't I understand?

1240
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:16,300
来了
Here you go guys.

1241
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,380
谢谢你
Thanks Tim.

1242
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,840
这样手指不会拧拧的
Just so you don't get sticky fingers.

1243
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,070
提米  能帮个忙吗?
Tim can you help us?

1244
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,540
我们要赌一赌输赢
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1245
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,980
听过乔纳斯索克吗?
Ever heard of Jonas Salk?

1246
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:30,850
被治愈的小儿麻痹症患者
Sure. Cured polio.

1247
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,480
听过爱因斯坦吗?
Ever heard of Albert Einstein?

1248
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:39,070
杰洛蓝勃呢?  听过吗?
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?

1249
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:41,530
没有
No.

1250
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,790
谢谢
Thank you Tim.

1251
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,390
谁赌赢了
So who won the bet?

1252
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,660
我赢了
I did.

1253
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:51,290
这不是我的事
This isn't about me Sean.

1254
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:54,530
我跟这年轻人比不算什么
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1255
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,710
你听过杰洛蓝勃吗?
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1256
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:04,810
在1905年有许多以研究宇宙闻名的教授
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors renown for their study of the universe.

1257
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,220
但改变世界的却是个...
But it was a 26- year- old Swiss patent clerk...

1258
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:12,150
趁闲暇时研究物理的26岁办事员
doing physics in his spare time who changed the world.

1259
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,770
你可以想像如果爱因斯坦...
Can you imagine if Einstein would have given that up...

1260
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:16,400
每天都喝得烂醉的话会怎样?
just to get drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night.

1261
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,020
我们都会失去一些东西
We all would have lost something.

1262
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,150
而提米绝不会听过他
Tim would never have heard of him.

1263
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,640
非常戏剧化
Pretty dramatic Gerry.

1264
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:24,280
不是
No it isn't Sean.

1265
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,910
这孩子有天赋
This boy has that gift.

1266
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,570
他只是没方向  我们该给他
He just doesn't got the direction but we can give that to him.

1267
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:33,510
在60年代曾有一个...
Hey Gerry in the 1960s...

1268
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,910
密西根大学毕业的年轻人
there was a young man graduated from University of Michigan.

1269
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,380
他的数学很出色
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1270
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,750
特别是有界集函数
Specifically bounded harmonic functions.

1271
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:43,620
他到柏克莱当助教  潜力惊人
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1272
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,060
然后在蒙大拿州赢得竞赛
Then he moved to Montana and he blew the competition away.

1273
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,890
好  他是谁?
Yeah so who was he?

1274
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,890
泰德卡辛斯基
Ted Kaczynski.

1275
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:51,960
没听过
Haven't heard of him.

1276
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,000
提米
Hey Timmy!

1277
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,570
谁是泰德卡辛斯基?
Who's Ted Kaczynski?

1278
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,730
邮包炸弹狂
Unabomber.

1279
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,610
那就是我说的  他需要方向
That's exactly what I'm talking about. We gotta give this kid direction.

1280
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,340
他能贡献世人  我们能帮他
He can contribute to the world and we can help him do that.

1281
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:08,280
方向是一回事  操纵是另一回事
Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another.

1282
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,450
你要让他自己发掘
We have to let him find.

1283
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,920
尚恩  我不是每晚坐在家里...
I'm not sitting at home every night...

1284
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,950
策划怎么摧毁他的人生!
twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin this boy's life!

1285
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,500
我18岁就会做高等数学...
I was doing advanced mathematics when I was 18...

1286
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,080
20年后才得到菲尔德奖章
and it still took me over 20 years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.

1287
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,550
也许他不想照你的想法去做
Maybe he doesn't want what you want.

1288
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,490
人生不只是一个他妈的奖章
There's more to life than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1289
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:30,700
这太重要了  要超越个人立场
This is too important Sean and it's above personal rivalry.

1290
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,040
等等  我们谈的是这孩子
Wait a minute. Let's talk about the boy.

1291
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,870
为何不给他时间想清楚要什么?
Why don't we give him time to figure out what he wants?

1292
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:39,020
很棒的理论  可为你创造奇迹
That's a wonderful theory Sean. It worked wonders for you didn't it?

1293
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,210
对  你这自负的混蛋!
Yeah it did you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1294
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:44,710
我很遗憾
Oh I'm sorry.

1295
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,660
很遗憾我来了  我是出于好意
I'm sorry that I came here today. I came here out of courtesy.

1296
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,520
我想让你参与这件事
I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1297
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:50,650
我很高兴能够参与
Nice to be in the loop.

1298
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:53,660
他此刻正在我安排的面谈中
The boy's in a meeting right now I set up for him over at McNeil.

1299
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,120
威尔  我不清楚你的意思
Well Will I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

1300
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:01,130
我们已经给你职位了
We've already offered you a position.

1301
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,830
这年头做事没人不拿酬金的
Nobody in this town works without a retainer guys.

1302
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:07,030
你们认为找得到  我祝福你们
You think you can find somebody who does you have my blessin'.

1303
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,400
但没有人可以像我做得那么好
But I think we all know that person is not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1304
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,600
我们已给你年薪八万四加福利
Will our offer is $84  000 a year.

1305
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,620
酬金
Retainer! Retainer.

1306
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,420
你是要我们现在给你现金?
You want us to give you cash right now?

1307
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,620
慢点  我没那么说
Whoa- ho- ho. Easy...Now I didn't say that.

1308
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:30,700
但我口袋里如果有两百块
Allegedly your situation for you.

1309
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:37,240
你们的处境会同时获得改善
Would be concurrently improved if I had...$200 in my back pocket right now.

1310
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:42,370
我没有  赖瑞
I don't think I can...Larry?

1311
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,640
我有73块
I've got $73.

1312
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,710
你收支票吗?
Will you take a check?

1313
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:51,470
你们这种举止相当可疑
Let me tell you somethin'. You're suspect.

1314
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,980
对  你们
Yeah you.

1315
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,970
我不知道你们的声誉怎样
I don't know what your reputation is in this town

1316
01:18:56,970 --> 01:19:02,350
但耍这种花招  我一定会调查
but after the shit you tried to pull today you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1317
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:07,320
关于我们未来的合作
Now any business we have heretofore

1318
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,290
请和我的律师谈
you can speak with my aforementioned attorney.

1319
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:13,530
再见  在那天到来前
Good day gentlemen.

1320
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:17,900
拼命干活吧
And until that day comes keep your ear to the grindstone.

1321
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,090
怎么样?
How's it goin'?

1322
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,260
很好
Fine.

1323
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,680
好
Good.

1324
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:39,830
要帮忙吗?
Want some help?

1325
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:40,870
不要!
No!

1326
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:44,730
给我看一下  我们要去练球场
Come on. Give me one little peek and we'll go to the batting cages.

1327
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:50,610
我一定要念这个
No. It is actually important that I learn this.

1328
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,540
真的很重要...
It's really important...

1329
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,310
对我而言
to me okay?

1330
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,080
好吧
All right.

1331
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,680
那就在这边待一整天
Why don't we just hang out here all day?

1332
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,250
有何不可
Yes why don't we?

1333
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,520
好  多管闲事先生
All right Mr. Nosey Parker.

1334
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:08,820
既然你打算烦我...
Seeing as you're intent on breaking my balls...

1335
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:11,890
让我问你一个问题
let me ask you a question.

1336
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,320
好
All right.

1337
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:16,940
你有影像记忆力吗?
Do you have a photographic memory?

1338
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,470
不知道  我就是记得
I don't know. I just kind of remember.

1339
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:24,140
好比你可以记得你的电话号码
I mean how do you remember your phone number? You just do.

1340
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,910
你念过有机化学吗?
Have you studied organic chemistry?

1341
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,240
一点点
A little bit.

1342
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:28,750
为了好玩?
Oh just for fun?

1343
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,980
对  为了找乐趣
Yeah for kicks.

1344
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,400
念有机化学会有趣  你疯啦
Yeah it's so much fun studying organic chemistry. Are you mad?

1345
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,120
你精神失常吗?
Have you completely lost your mind?

1346
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,850
没人会为了好玩念化学
Nobody studies it for fun.

1347
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,030
尤其对你这种人而言根本没必要
It's not a necessity especially for someone like you.

1348
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:43,890
我这种人?
Someone like me?

1349
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,540
时间分配给练球场和酒吧的人
Someone who divides their time fairly evenly between batting cages and bars.

1350
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,660
人家不会说那是必要的
I would hardly say it was a necessity.

1351
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,170
哈佛有很聪明的人
You know there are very smart people here at Harvard.

1352
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,840
但他们都得付出努力才能学会
Even they have to study because this is really hard.

1353
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:06,410
你却简单地做到了  我不懂
And yet... you do it so easily. I don't understand.

1354
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:09,110
我不懂你的大脑怎么运作
I don't understand how your mind works.

1355
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,750
你弹钢琴吗?
Did you play the piano?

1356
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:11,400
别转移话题
I want to talk about this.

1357
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,570
我跟你解释嘛  你会弹吗?
No I'm trying to explain it to you. Do you play the piano?

1358
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,360
一点点
Yeah a bit.

1359
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,490
好  你看着钢琴就看到莫札特
So when you look at a piano you see Mozart.

1360
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,730
我看到筷子
I see "Chopsticks."

1361
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:23,640
好  贝多芬  他一看到钢琴
All right well Beethoven okay? He looked at a piano

1362
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,750
很自然地就会弹
and it just made sense to him. He could just play.

1363
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,880
你是说你会弹琴?
So what are you saying? You play the piano?

1364
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,400
根本不会  望着钢琴...
Not a lick. I look at a piano...

1365
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,040
我只看到琴键  踏板和木头
I see a bunch of keys three pedals and a box of wood.

1366
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:36,880
但贝多芬  莫扎特就会弹
But Beethoven Mozart...They saw it. They could just play.

1367
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,980
我不会画画  连球都打不好
I couldn't paint you a picture. I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1368
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:42,920
我也不会弹琴
And I can't play the piano.

1369
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,550
但你会一小时内做好化学作业
But you can do my O- chem paper in under an hour.

1370
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:50,620
对  我就是会那种东西
Right. Well I mean when it came to stuff like that I could always just play.

1371
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:55,440
我只能解释到这样
That's the best I can explain it.

1372
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,450
来  我有话告诉你
Come here. I have to tell you something.

1373
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,100
我跟你讲一件事
I have to tell you something.

1374
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,660
不公平
It's not fair.

1375
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,690
什么不公平?
What's not fair? What?

1376
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,830
我在这边四年了
I've been here for four years.

1377
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,830
现在才发现你
And I've only just found you.

1378
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,600
起码你还是发现我啦
Well you found me.

1379
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:46,010
你醒着吗?
Are you awake?

1380
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,980
睡了
No.

1381
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:51,290
你没睡
Yes you are.

1382
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:57,300
跟我一起去加州
Will come to California with me.

1383
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,070
什么?
What?

1384
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,400
我要你跟我去加州
I want you to come to California with me.

1385
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,110
你确定吗?
You sure about that?

1386
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:14,780
确定
Oh yeah.

1387
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,870
你怎么知道?
Yeah but how do you know?

1388
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,720
不晓得
I don't know.

1389
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,410
我就是知道
I just know.

1390
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,320
但你怎么会知道?
Yeah but how do you know?

1391
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,200
我知道  因为我感觉到
I know because I feel it.

1392
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,770
你说的是很严肃的事
Because that's a really serious thing you're saying.

1393
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:36,070
下礼拜到了加州...
You could be in California next week...

1394
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:39,410
你可能会发现不喜欢我的地方
and you might find out something about me you don't like.

1395
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:42,340
你会希望你没说过这些话...
Maybe you wish you hadn't said that...

1396
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,770
但这是无法收回的事
but you know it's such a serious thing you can't take it back.

1397
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,350
于是我跟不爱我的人困在加州...
Now I'm stuck in California with someone that doesn't really want to be with me...

1398
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,510
她却希望一切能收回
just wish they had a take- back.

1399
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,880
什么?  什么是收回?
A what? What's a take- back?

1400
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,550
我不想收回
I don't want a take- back.

1401
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:57,650
我只要你跟我去加州
I just want you to come to California with me.

1402
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,920
我不能去加州
Well I can't go to California with you so...

1403
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,110
为什么?
Why not?

1404
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:09,280
一是因为我在这边有工作
Well one because I got a job here.

1405
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:11,430
二是因为我住这边
And two because I live here.

1406
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:17,250
你不爱我就该告诉我
Look um if you don't love me you should just tell me.

1407
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,470
我没说不爱你
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1408
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:24,510
那为什么不去?  你怕什么?
Then why? Why won't you come? What are you so scared of?

1409
01:24:24,510 --> 01:24:27,120
我怕什么?
What am I so scared of?

1410
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,320
你不怕什么?
Well what aren't you scared of?

1411
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,390
你活在没人挑战的世界里...你怕要做改变你的事情
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges you...

1412
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:37,360
别教我  我的世界怎么样
Don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1413
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,300
你只是想跟低下阶层搞一下
You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town.

1414
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,200
然后到斯坦福
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.

1415
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,440
你会嫁给有钱的混蛋
You're gonna marry some rich prick who your parents will approve of...

1416
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:49,280
跟其他富家女说你到过贫民窟
and just sit around with the other trust fund babies and talk about how you went slummin' too once.

1417
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,010
你在说什么?
Why are you saying this?

1418
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:54,850
你为何这么在乎钱?
What is your obsession with this money?

1419
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:57,780
我十三岁丧父  继承家产
My father died when I was 13 and I inherited this money.

1420
01:24:58,790 --> 01:25:03,030
我每天醒来都希望能还给他
You don't think every day I wake up and I wish I could give it back.

1421
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,730
只要能让我多陪他一天
That I would give it back in a second

1422
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:08,200
我会马上还给他  但我不能
if it meant I could have one more day with him.

1423
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,970
那是我的人生  我面对它
But I can't and that's my life and I deal with it.

1424
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:14,310
别把你的害怕推到我身上
So don't put your shit on me when you're the one that's afraid.

1425
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:17,050
我怕?  我他妈的怕什么?
I'm afraid? What am I afraid of? What the fuck am I afraid of?

1426
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:19,510
你怕我  怕我不爱你
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back.

1427
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:21,880
你知道吗?  我也怕
You know what? I'm afraid too.

1428
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,450
但我想试试看  起码我诚实
But fuck it I want to give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.

1429
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,580
难道我对你不诚实?
I'm not honest with you?

1430
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,320
不  你的十二个哥哥呢?
No what about your 12 brothers?

1431
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,230
你不能走  不准离开
No you're not going. You're not leaving.

1432
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:36,600
你想知道什么?  我没哥哥?
What do you want to know? That I don't have 12 brothers?

1433
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,660
我是个他妈的孤儿?
That I'm a fuckin' orphan?

1434
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,100
- 你不会想听的  - 我并不晓得
- You don't want to hear that.  - I didn't know that.

1435
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,870
你不会想听我童年被香烟烧
You don't want to hear I got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was little.

1436
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:44,410
我不晓得
I didn't know that.

1437
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:46,460
那不是手术  那混蛋刺伤我
That this isn't fuckin' surgery. The motherfucker stabbed me.

1438
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,440
你不会想听这种事!
You don't want to hear that shit Skylar!

1439
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,650
别跟我说你想知道!
Don't tell me you want that shit!

1440
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:51,620
我想听  因为我想帮你
I do want to hear that. I want to help you.

1441
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:54,120
帮我?  什么鬼东西?
Help me? What the fuck?

1442
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,250
我脸上有写着请救我吗?
What do I got a fuckin' sign on my back that says "Save me"?

1443
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,480
我像要人救的样子吗?
Do I look like I need that?

1444
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,750
我想跟你在一起...我爱你
No I just want to be with you...I love you.

1445
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,560
别耍我
Don't bullshit me!

1446
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,460
别他妈的耍我
Don't bullshit me! Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!

1447
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,930
我爱你
I love you.

1448
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:13,840
我要听你说你不爱我
I want to hear you say that you don't love me.

1449
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:21,080
那么我就不再打电话给你...
Because if you say that...then I won't call you...

1450
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,740
不再出现在你的生命里
and I won't be in your life.

1451
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:32,330
我不爱你
I don't love you.

1452
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:15,760
很多人都无从得知自己的天赋
Most people never get to see how brilliant they can be.

1453
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,800
因为找不到相信他们的老师
They don't find teachers that believe in them.

1454
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,600
于是他们深信自己很笨
They get convinced they're stupid.

1455
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,540
希望你能感激他所做的
I hope you appreciate what he's doing

1456
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,910
我知道他很喜欢跟你合作
because I've seen how much he enjoys working with you

1457
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:33,510
我没有反对你
not against you.

1458
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,920
你好  威尔
Hello Will.

1459
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,220
汤姆  拿点咖啡来
Tom can you get us some coffee?

1460
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,690
好
Sure.

1461
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,960
好  我看看
Now let's see.

1462
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:58,540
很好  正确
Good. This is correct.

1463
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:01,940
你用了"麦罗伦"
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1464
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:05,550
我不知道叫什么
Yeah I don't know what you call it but...

1465
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,540
这样不对
This can't be right.

1466
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,750
这会很难堪
This would be very embarrassing.

1467
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:17,950
你是否想过...
Did you ever consider...

1468
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,360
我确信是对的
I'm pretty sure it's right.

1469
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:21,760
以后能在尚恩的办公室做吗?
Hey look can we do this at Sean's office from now on?

1470
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,720
我得放下工作过来  坐车很烦
Because I got to knock off work to come here and the commute is killin' me.

1471
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:29,170
好  可不可能...
Yeah sure. Did you think of the possibility...

1472
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:35,410
它是对的  带回家吧
That's right. It's right. Just take it home with you.

1473
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:40,500
麦尼尔的面谈怎么了?
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1474
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:42,450
我去不了  我有约会
I couldn't go. I had a date.

1475
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,140
所以我派我的谈判代表去
So I sent my chief negotiator.

1476
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,730
你自己的时间爱干嘛随你
On your own time you can do whatever you like Will.

1477
01:28:52,730 --> 01:28:55,860
但我安排的会谈
But when I set up a meeting with my associates

1478
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,130
你没出现会让我丢脸
and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.

1479
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,890
好  那就别安排了
Then don't set up any more meetings.

1480
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,070
我不会  我会取消
I won't. I'll cancel 'em.

1481
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:06,370
我会亲自给你工作
I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.

1482
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:10,670
或许我不想一辈子做解说员
Maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my fuckin' life explainin' shit to people.

1483
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,260
但你可以表示感激吧
I think you could show me some appreciation.

1484
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,760
感激?  你知道这多容易吗?
A little appreciation? Do you know how easy this is for me?

1485
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:27,440
你知道吗?  别他妈的说笑了
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1486
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,540
我很遗憾你不会解  真的
I'm sorry you can't do this...I really am...

1487
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:35,890
我不想坐在这儿看你摸索
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1488
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:41,720
这样你就会有更多的时间喝醉?
Then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk instead wouldn't you?

1489
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:47,650
没错  这浪费我的时间
You're right. This is probably a total waste of my time.

1490
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,880
你说得对
You're right Will.

1491
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,520
我解不出来
I can't do this proof

1492
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,800
但你会  说到这个
but you can. And when it comes to that

1493
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,100
只有少数人看出你我的差别
it's only about just a handful of people in the world who can tell the difference between you and me.

1494
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,830
我是其中之一
But I'm one of them.

1495
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:18,590
我很遗憾
Sorry.

1496
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:21,560
我也是
Yeah so am I.

1497
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:24,220
我常希望没遇到你
Most days I wish I never met you

1498
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:29,490
这样我夜里就能睡得着
because then I could sleep at night.

1499
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:35,410
不用惦记有个像你这样的人
I didn't have to walk around with the knowledge that there was someone like you out there.

1500
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:46,260
我不必看你糟蹋天赋
I didn't have to watch you throw it all away.

1501
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,930
比尔  等等
Bill hold it.

1502
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,020
听到没?
Did you hear that?

1503
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,600
摩根!
Morgan!

1504
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,760
如你还敢在我妈房里看A片
If you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room again

1505
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,700
我就揍扁你
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'!

1506
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,520
怎么了?
What's up fellas?

1507
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,060
要打手枪在你家里打  脏死了
Morgan why don't you jerk off in your own fuckin' house. That's fuckin' filthy.

1508
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:31,100
我家没录影机
I don't have a V.C.R. in my house.

1509
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:31,590
他妈的我不管
I don't care it.

1510
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,070
你不会用我手套打手枪吧
Come on. Not in my glove.

1511
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,010
我没用手套
I didn't use the glove.

1512
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:41,680
那是我的小联盟手套
That's my Little League glove.

1513
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:42,940
你要我怎么做
What do you want me to do?

1514
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:49,020
你怎么搞的?  操棒球手套啊?
I mean what's wrong with you? You'll hump a baseball glove?

1515
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,160
我没有  我用它清干净
I- I just used it for cleanup.

1516
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,060
别在我妈房里打手枪了
Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.

1517
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,260
这屋里还有别台录影机吗?
Is there another V.C.R. in the house?

1518
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,660
真可悲
It's just sad bro.

1519
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:06,000
我为什么该为国安局做事?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?

1520
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,240
你将研究尖端科技
Well you'd be working on the cutting edge.

1521
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:12,170
接触别处看不到的科技
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you wouldn't see anywhere else

1522
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:15,280
因为都已列为机密
because we've classified it.

1523
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,180
混沌数学  高级算法...
Superstring theory chaos math advanced algorithms.

1524
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,150
破解密码
Code breaking.

1525
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,250
那是其中一个层面
That's one aspect of what we do.

1526
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,090
得了  那就是你们做的事
Oh come on. That is what you do.

1527
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:30,160
你们处理八成的情报量
You guys handle 80% of the intelligence workload.

1528
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,760
是中情局的七倍大
You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.

1529
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:39,130
我们不喜欢自夸  但你说对了
We don't like to brag about that Will but you're exactly right.

1530
01:32:39,130 --> 01:32:43,630
问题不是"你干嘛为国安局做事"
So the way I see it the question isn't:"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1531
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:48,590
而是"你为何不做?"
The question is: "Why shouldn't you?"

1532
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,840
我为何不为国安局做事?
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1533
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:54,010
很难的问题
That's a tough one

1534
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,640
让我想想  若我做了
but I'll take a shot. Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.

1535
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,430
国安局会给我破解不了的密码
and somebody puts a code on my desk. Something no one else can break.

1536
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,520
或许我试了  也破解了
Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.

1537
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,660
我很满意  因为表现良好
I'm real happy with myself because I did my job well.

1538
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:05,590
但也许那个密码...
But maybe that code...

1539
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:08,320
是位于北非或中东的叛军位置
was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.

1540
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:10,730
他们发现后轰炸叛军藏身地
Once they have that location they bomb the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1541
01:33:10,730 --> 01:33:16,170
陌生的一千五百人因此丧命
Fifteen hundred people that I never met never had no problem with get killed.

1542
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:19,340
然后政客派特战部队防守该区
Now the politicians are saying "Send in the Marines to secure the area  "

1543
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,770
他们才不在乎
'cause they don't give a shit.

1544
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:24,040
因为被射杀的不会是他们的子女
It won't be their kid over there gettin' shot

1545
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,980
因为他们都加入了后备部队
just like it wasn't them when their number got called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

1546
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,950
而在那边中弹的南区孩子
It'll be some kid from Southie over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1547
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,390
回国后发现他以前工作的工厂...
He comes back to find the plant he used to work at...

1548
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,790
被移转到他去打仗的国家
got exported to the country he got back from

1549
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:36,190
害他中弹的敌人抢了他的饭碗
and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job...

1550
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,930
因为那儿的人一天工资不到一元
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks.

1551
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:41,500
最后他发现他会上战场...
Meanwhile he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place...

1552
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:44,670
只是为了得到该国的廉价原油
was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.

1553
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:47,170
好让石油公司利用战争恐慌
Of course the oil companies used a skirmish over there

1554
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:50,330
抬高国内油价  小赚一番
to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them.

1555
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:53,030
但两块五一加仑有个屁用
but it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1556
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,540
他们得花时间把石油运回国
They're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil of course.

1557
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,010
或许还请了一个酗酒船长
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire an alcoholic skipper

1558
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:00,780
他爱喝马丁尼  跟冰山玩滑雪
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1559
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,980
不久他撞上冰山  原油外漏...
It ain't too long till he hits one spills the oil...

1560
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:06,150
杀光北大西洋的海洋生物
and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic.

1561
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:08,520
现在我朋友失业  也开不起车
So now my buddy's out of work he can't afford to drive

1562
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,660
他走路去面谈  很难受
so he's walkin' to the fuckin' job interviews...

1563
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:13,330
因为炮弹片让你慢性出血
which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1564
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:15,730
他很饿  因为每次想吃东西
Meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat

1565
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:20,900
唯一的特餐是北大西洋鳕鱼
the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1566
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:22,900
所以  我会怎么想?
So what did I think?

1567
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,500
我有更好的点子
I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.

1568
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:29,440
干  我干脆射杀我朋友算了
I figure fuck it. While I'm at it why not just shoot my buddy

1569
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:32,810
把工作给敌人  提高油价
take his job give it to his sworn enemy hike up gas prices.

1570
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:34,470
轰炸村庄  打死小海豹
Bomb a village club a baby seal

1571
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:37,280
吸食大麻  加入后备部队
hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?

1572
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,590
我还可因此被选为总统
I can be elected president.

1573
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,320
你感觉孤单吗?
You feel like you're alone?

1574
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,190
什么?
What?

1575
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:45,720
你有心灵伴侣吗?
Do you have a soul mate?

1576
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,560
我有...?  说清楚点
Do I have a...Define that.

1577
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:52,330
能够和你匹敌的人
Somebody who challenges you.

1578
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:53,690
我有查克
Uh Chuckie.

1579
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,800
不  查克是你的家人
No Chuckie's family. He'd lie down in fuckin' traffic for you.

1580
01:34:57,470 --> 01:35:03,240
我讲的是触动你心灵的人
I'm talking about someone who opens up things for you touches your soul.

1581
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,400
我有...
I got...I got...

1582
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:05,310
谁?
Who?

1583
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:07,950
有很多
I got plenty.

1584
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:09,140
说出来
Well name 'em.

1585
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,220
莎士比亚  尼采  佛斯特...
Shakespeare Nietzsche Frost...

1586
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,780
奥康纳  康德  洛克.
O'Connor Kant Pope Locke.

1587
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,990
很棒  他们都死了
That's great. They're all dead.

1588
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,520
对我而言  他们没死
Not to me they're not.

1589
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,350
没死?  你无法和他们对谈
You don't have a lot of dialogue with them.

1590
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:21,120
你不能回应他们
You can't give back to them Will.

1591
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:24,160
除非你有仙丹
Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater.

1592
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,190
对  那就是我所说的
That's what I'm saying.

1593
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:29,840
如果你不踏出第一步...
You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world...

1594
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,140
你绝不会有那种关系
where you're always afraid to take the first step

1595
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:36,010
因为你只看到负面的事
because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road.

1596
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,510
你要摆出教授架子了?
You gonna take the professor's side on this?

1597
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:38,570
少跟我来这套  没有
Don't give me a line of shit. No.

1598
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,810
我不想做那个工作
I didn't want the job.

1599
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:42,250
我不管你是否为政府工作
It's not about the job. I don't care if you work for the government.

1600
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:46,220
但你能随心所欲  不受束缚
But you can do anything you want. You are bound by nothing.

1601
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,050
你热爱什么?  想要什么?
What are you passionate about? What do you want?

1602
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,860
有人一辈子砌砖...
There are guys who work their entire life layin' brick...

1603
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:55,730
为了让孩子拥有像你现在的机会
so their kids have a chance at the opportunities you have here.

1604
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,790
我可没要求这机会
I didn't ask for this.

1605
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,560
不  你生来就有
No. You were born with it

1606
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,760
别逃避说你没要求
So don't cop out behind: "I didn't ask for this."

1607
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:03,960
什么叫逃避?  砌砖哪里不对?
What do you mean cop out? What's wrong with layin' brick?

1608
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:04,800
没有
Nothing.

1609
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:06,870
没什么不对  我盖房子...
There's nothin' wrong. That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1610
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,780
对  我爸砌砖  好吗?
Right. My dad laid brick okay?

1611
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:11,780
他拼命干活让我受教育
Busted his ass so I could have an education.

1612
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:13,280
没错  那是可敬的行业
Exactly. That's an honorable profession.

1613
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,980
修车哪不对?
What's wrong with fixin' somebody's car?

1614
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:18,090
我让人能上班  这是很光荣的事
Someone will get to work the next day because of me. That's honor in that.

1615
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:19,590
是的  是很光荣

搭40分钟火车让大学生...
There's honor in takin' that 40- minute train ride...

1617
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,720
上课有干净的地板...
so those college kids could come in in the morning and their floors are clean.

1618
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,830
整洁的桌椅也很可敬
And their wastebaskets are empty. That's real work.

1619
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:27,380
对
That's right.

1620
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,930
对  是很可敬
And that's honorable.

1621
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:33,200
相信你是为了这份荣耀才做的
I'm sure that's why you took that job. I mean for the honor of it.

1622
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,100
我只是有个小问题
I just have a little question here.

1623
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:39,000
你到哪里都能做工友
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1624
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:41,970
为何挑中一流的科技学府?
Why did you work at the most prestigious technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1625
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:44,970
夜里偷偷地解算...
Why did you sneak around at night and finish other people's formulas...

1626
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:51,590
世上只有两个人会的方程式?
that only one or two people in the world could do and then lie about it?

1627
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:54,080
我看不到其中的荣耀
'Cause I don't see a lot of honor in that Will.

1628
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:00,630
你真正想做什么?
So what do you really wanna do?

1629

我想当牧羊人

Maybe you should go do that.

1633
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:13,940
什么?
What?

01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:17,340
要自慰回家弄条湿毛巾搞
You know if you're gonna jerk off why don't you just do it at home with a moist towel?

你在赶我?
You're chuckin' me?

1636

游戏时间结束了
Playtime's over okay?

1642
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:27,880
你为什么赶我走?
Why are you kickin' me out?

1643
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:31,290
你想教我人生大道理?

1644

看看你  糟老头

跟你合作
Workin' with you.

1647
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,900
你的心灵伴侣在哪?
Where's your soul mate?

01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:43,870
你就不敢再为人生下赌注了?
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in your chips and you walk away?

1652
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:45,310
起码我玩过一把
At least I played a hand.

1653
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:47,970
那你输了  输得很惨
You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1654

Some people will lose a big hand like that and have the sack to ante up again.

却答不出来这么简单的问题
But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer

1659
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:14,370
因为你不知道

我不会只当营造工人

1667
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,780
你知道我并不在乎

1679
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:40,340

Yeah fuckin' sit in a room and do long division for the next 50 years.

1697

我会成为他妈的实验室老鼠

But in 20 years if you're still livin' here

That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1709
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:22,620
你在胡扯什么?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1710
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:25,190
你拥有我们没有的天赋
Look you got something none of us have.

1711
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:26,910
拜托  为何大家都这么说?
Oh come on!  Why is it always this?

1712
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:29,680
难道是我对不起自己吗?
I fuckin' owe it to myself to do this or that. What if I don't want to?

1713
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:34,090
不  你没有对不起自己
No no no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1714
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,400
是你对不起我
You owe it to me

1715
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,100
因为我明天醒来五十岁了
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be 50

1716
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:44,040
还在干这种事  无所谓
and I'll still be doin' this shit. That's all right. That's fine.

1717
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,770
而你已拥有百万奖券
I mean you're sittin' on a winnin' lottery ticket.

1718
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:51,400
却窝囊的不敢兑现  狗屁
You're too much of a pussy to cash it in and that's bullshit.

1719
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,580
我会不惜一切交换你所拥有的
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything to have what you got.

1720
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,550
其他这些人也是
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1721
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:01,320
你再待20年是侮辱我们
Be an insult to us if you're still here in 20 years.

1722
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:04,420
窝在这里是浪费你时间
Hangin' around here is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1723
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,450
你懂什么?
You don't know that.

1724
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,180
我不懂?
I don't know that?

1725
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:07,090
你不懂
No. You don't know that.

1726
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:09,690
我告诉你我懂什么
Oh I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.

1727
01:43:10,230 --> 01:43:12,930
我每天到你家接你
Every day I come by your house and I pick you up.

1728
01:43:13,530 --> 01:43:17,640
我们出去喝酒笑闹  那很棒
We go out and have a few drinks and few laughs and it's great.

1729
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,410
但我一天中最棒的时刻
You know what the best part of my day is?

1730
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:21,840
只有十秒
It's for about ten seconds:

1731
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,370
从停车场到你家门口
from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door.

1732
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:29,720
每次我敲门都希望你不在了
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.

1733
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:32,420
不说再见  什么都没有
No "good- bye  " no "see ya later." No nothing.

1734
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,940
就这么走了
You just left.

1735
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:38,360
我懂得不多  但我很清楚
I don't know much but I know that.

1736
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:52,970
真是乱来  我让你参与...
This is a disaster Sean. I brought you in here...

1737
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:56,210
是要你帮这孩子  不是赶走他
because I wanted you to help me with the boy not to run him out.

1738
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,680
我知道怎么应付他
I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1739
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,740
我不管你跟他有什么默契
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy!

1740
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:00,850
我不在乎你们花我的钱开心
I don't care if you have a few laughs even at my expense.

1741
01:44:00,850 --> 01:44:03,420
但你敢破坏我的事看看
But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.

1742
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:03,970
破坏?
Undermine?

1743
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,720
这孩子目前很脆弱
This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1744
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,960
我了解他很脆弱  好吗?
I do understand. He is at a fragile point.

1745
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,790
他还有些问题
He's got problems.

1746
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:11,090
他有什么问题?
What problems does he have?

1747
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:13,720
当工友或坐牢会比较好吗?
That he's better off as a janitor in jail?

1748
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,420
跟一群智障在一起会比较好吗?
Better hanging out with a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1749
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:18,270
你想他为什么那么做?
Why do you think he does that?

1750
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:20,530
你晓得为什么吗?
You have any fuckin' clue why?

1751
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:21,730
他能应付问题
He can handle the problems.

1752
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,170
应付工作  显然也应付你了
He can handle the work. He obviously handled you.

1753
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:25,000
听我说
Listen to me.

1754
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:28,340
他为何躲避?  为何不信任人?
Why is he hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1755
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:30,340
因为他的遭遇
Because the first thing that happened to him

1756
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:32,000
他被应该爱他的人遗弃
he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1757
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:33,310
别跟我讲佛洛伊德的屁话
Don't give me that Freudian crap.

1758
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:36,380
他为什么跟你所谓的智障混?
Why does he hang out with those retarded gorillas as you call them?

1759
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,920
因为如果他叫他们扁你
Because any one of them if he asked them to

1760
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:42,010
他们会照办  那叫做义气
would take a bat to your head. That's called loyalty.

1761
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:43,180
是喔  很感人
Yeah that's very touching.

1762
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,260
他应付谁了?
Who's he handling?

1763
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:47,660
他在别人离开之前先赶人走
He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him.

1764
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:49,490
那是防卫心理  好吗?
It's a defense mechanism all right?

1765
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:52,600
他因此孤独了20年
For 20 years he's been alone because of that.

1766
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,240
你现在逼他  事情会重演
If you push him right now it's gonna be the same thing all over again.

1767
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,800
我不会让他重蹈覆辙
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.

1768
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:58,910
别那么做
Don't you do that.

1769
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:59,600
什么?
What?

1770
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:04,380
别让他认为放弃或失败没关系
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit that it's okay to be a failure.

1771
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,310
绝对有关系!
Because it's not okay Sean!

1772
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:09,050
如果你是气我成功...
And if you're angry at me for being successful for being what you could have been...

1773
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,240
我没气你
I'm not angry at you.

1774
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:12,910
你有  你憎恶我
Oh yes you're angry at me.

1775
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:17,000
我不会因为成功向你赔不是
You resent me but I'm not gonna apologize for any success I've had.

1776
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,060
你气我做到你本来能做到的事
You're angry at me for doing what you could have done!

1777
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,760
你扪心自问
But ask yourself Sean...Ask yourself...

1778
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,500
你要威尔有那种感受?
if you want Will to feel that way...

1779
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:24,900
你要他感觉像失败者?
if you want him to feel like a failure?

1780
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,800
你这个自大狂!
You arrogant shit!

1781
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,540
我不去同学会的原因
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions

1782
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,770
是因为受不了你的眼神
'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1783
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:34,170
那种屈尊难堪的眼神
That condescending embarrassed look.

1784
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:36,940
你认为我失败  我有自知之明
You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.

1785
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,480
我为自己感到骄傲
I'm proud of what I do.

1786
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,740
那是自觉的选择
It was a conscious choice.

1787
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,240
我没搞砸!
I didn't fuck up!

1788
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,880
你和你朋友认为我很可怜
And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case.

1789
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,520
你和你那些狗屁课程
You and your kiss- ass chorus...

1790
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,880
你老是提自己的菲尔德奖章...
following you around going "The Field's medal!"

1791
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:51,190
你怎么还是这么怕失败?
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid of failure?

1792
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:52,930
你是嫉妒我有奖章吗?
It's about my medal isn't it?

1793
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,830
天哪  我回家拿给你  送给你好了
Oh God I could go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1794
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:55,660
拜托不要
Oh please don't.

1795
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,360
把奖章塞进你妈的屁眼里
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass all right?

1796
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,770
因为我不在乎你的奖章
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal

1797
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:03,000
因为我在你还没当上数学之神前就认识你了
because I knew you before you were a mathematical god

1798
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,200
早在你满脸青春痘  思乡...
when you were pimple- faced and homesick...

1799
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,830
不知要尿在床的那一头的时候
and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1800
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,910
是  你过去现在都比我聪明
Yeah you were smarter than me then and you're smarter than me now.

1801
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:10,540
你人生变成这样别怪我
So don't blame me for how your life turned out.

1802
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:12,810
我没怪你!  这跟你无关!
I don't blame you! It's not about you!

1803
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:16,120
你这数学混球!  是关于那孩子!
You mathematical dick! It's about the boy!

1804
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,850
他是好孩子!  我不会看着你...
He's a good kid! And I won't see you...

1805
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:20,510
像现在糟蹋我般糟蹋他
fuck him up like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

1806
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,120
让他也感觉是失败者!
I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!

1807
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,690
他不会失败!
He won't be a failure!

1808
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:26,060
但你如果逼他!
But if you push him! If you ride him!

1809
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:32,230
我能有今天成就是逼出来的
I am what I am today because I was pushed and because I learned to push myself.

1810
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:35,370
他不是你!  你懂吗!
He's not you! You get that!

1811
01:46:37,170 --> 01:46:38,300
我待会再来
I can come back.

1812
01:46:38,410 --> 01:46:43,460
不  进来  我正要走
No come in. Uh I was just leaving.

1813
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:57,020
他和我之间的陈年往事
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way between me and him.

1814
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:59,770
跟你无关
You know. Not about you.

1815
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:06,370
那是什么?
What is that?

1816
01:47:06,370 --> 01:47:07,590
你的档案
This is your file.

1817
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:10,030
我要送回去给法官评估
I have to send it back to the judge for evaluation.

1818
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:16,120
你不会让我失败吧?
Oh. Hey you're not gonna fail me are you?

1819
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:22,040
里面怎么写?
What's it say?

1820
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,920
你想看吗?
Wanna read it?

1821
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,940
为什么?
Why?

1822
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:30,620
你有过那种经验吗?
Have you had any uh experience with that?

1823
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:32,090
20年的辅导
Twenty years of counseling.

1824
01:47:32,230 --> 01:47:34,220
我看过很惨的事
Yeah I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1825
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:38,190
你有那方面的经验吗?
I mean have you had any experience with that?

1826
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:44,740
个人的?
Personally?

1827
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,800
是的
Yeah.

1828
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:48,410
我有
Yeah I have.

1829
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:49,740
肯定不好
It sure ain't good.

1830
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,120
我爸是酒鬼  烂醉如泥
My father was an alcoholic. Mean fuckin' drunk.

1831
01:47:59,950 --> 01:48:02,890
他喝醉回家就想打人
He'd come home hammered lookin' to whale on somebody.

1832
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:08,340
我激怒他以保护妈妈和弟弟
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go after my mother and little brother.

1833
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,900
他若晚上带工具回来就精彩了
Interesting nights when he wore his rings.

1834
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:19,440
他把扳手  棍子和皮带摆桌上
He used to just put a wrench a stick and a belt on the table.

1835
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,880
然后说"选一个"
Just say "Choose."

1836
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,540
我会挑皮带
Well I gotta go with the belt there.

1837
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:25,780
我通常挑扳手
I used to go with the wrench.

1838
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:27,080
为什么是扳手?
Why the wrench?

1839
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,820
因为是"操他的"
'Cause fuck him that's why.

1840
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:31,150
你养父?
Your foster father?

1841
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:34,360
对  怎么样?
Yeah. So uh what is it.

1842
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:40,260
是不是威尔有"依附情结"?
Like Will has an attachment disorder? Is it all that stuff?

1843
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,020
害怕被遗弃?
Fear of abandonment?

1844
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:46,500
那是我跟史凯兰分手的原因吗?
Is that why I broke up with Skylar?

1845
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,760
我不晓得你们分手了
I didn't know you had.

1846
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:49,330
分手了
Yeah I did.

1847
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:50,690
想谈吗?
You wanna talk about it?

1848
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,960
不想
No.

1849
01:48:55,640 --> 01:49:01,780
威尔  我知道的不多
Hey Will I don't know a lot.

1850
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:03,580
但你看到这个没?
You see this?

1851
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:04,910
这些事
All this shit?

1852
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,780
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1853
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:16,500
是  我知道
Yeah I know that.

1854
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,370
看着我  孩子  不是你的错

1856
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,070
不是你的错
No. It's not your fault.

1857
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,140
我知道
I know.

1858
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:35,180
你不知道  不是你的错
No no you don't. It's not your fault.

1859
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:36,720
我知道
I know.

1860
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,050
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1861
01:49:38,050 --> 01:49:38,950
好
All right.

1862
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:42,600
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1863
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:45,660
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1864
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:47,130
别整我
Don't fuck with me all right?

1865
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:51,900
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1866
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,870
别整我好吗?  不要是你
Don't fuck with me Sean not you.

1867
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:58,410
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1868
01:50:03,660 --> 01:50:07,710
不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1869
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:21,760
我的天...真对不起
My God...My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

1870
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:38,070
去他们的  好吗?
Fuck them okay?

1871
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,230
有什么事吗?
Can I help you?

1872
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:07,300
我是威尔杭汀  我来谈工作
Yeah I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.

1873
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,750
请坐一下
Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1874
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:38,590
你选择哪一个?
Which one did you take?

1875

教授帮我安排的工作之一
It's one of the jobs the professor set me up with.

I haven't told him yet but I went down there and talked to my boss...

1878

1900
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:19,200
这违反医师病人关系吗?
Hey does this violate the patient- doctor relationship?

1901
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,860
除非你抓我屁股
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

1908
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:57,080
你怎么不管管他?
Why didn't you yoke him?

1909
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,110
摩根有一堆屁话
Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1910
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:03,480
天天有人想扁他  他还不让步

你的新工作要在剑桥来回
Well we knew you had to get back and forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1926
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:40,710
我不会每天载你  所以...
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin' drive you every day so...

1927
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,450
摩根想给你买免票证
Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1928
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:43,710
我没那么说
That's not what I was sayin'!

- 但你21岁了  - 可以合法喝酒
- But uh you're 21 now.  - You're legally allowed to drink.

我和比尔一起搜括零件
You know me and Bill scraped together the parts

1937
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,310

01:56:09,310 --> 01:56:11,310
车身都是我搞的

他烦了我两年要工作

1941
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:15,700
总得让他做帮手
I had to let him help with the car.

1942
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:17,320
你终于有工作了?  摩根
So you finally got a job huh Morgan?

我和比尔重新打造引擎
