in the southern colonies--

as a matter of fact, I won't,

- This is Professor Lambeau.

[ Chuckling ]

305
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:03,804
[ Will ] There is a lengthy
legal precedent, Your Honor,
going back to 1789,

306
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,974
whereby a defendant
can claim self-defense against
an agent of the government...

307
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:10,436
if that act is deemed a defense against
tyranny, a defense of liberty.

308
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:12,646
[ Clears Throat ]
Your Honor, Henry Ward Beecher,

309
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,483
- in Proverbs from the Plymouth
Pulpit, 1887, said, quote--
- 1887?

310
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:18,360
- Excuse me.
- This is the 20th century.

311
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:22,656
- He's gonna make a mockery.
- I am afforded the right to
speak in my own defense, sir,

312
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,409
by the Constitution
of the United States.

313
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,453
- Don't tell me about the Constitution.
- This guarantees my liberty.

314
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,955
"Liberty," in case you've forgotten,
is a soul's right to breathe.

315
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:32,541
When it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

316
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:34,835
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

317
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:38,172
- Ibid., Your Honor.
- Son, my turn.

I've been sitting here
for ten minutes now lookin' over
this rap sheet of yours.

February of '94.

00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:57,107
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

00:24:57,232 --> 00:25:01,445
"free property rights
of horse and carriage" from 1798.

00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:05,074
Joke. January '95,

Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

I'm also aware that you've been
through several foster homes.

The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

I don't recall meeting anyone
who matches that description.
I think I'd remember.

Oh, all right, you got me. It's the
ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

leave you alone all night.

I was wondering if you'd call me.

- Yeah, look, I was wondering--
- Yo, what's up, baby?

- What you doing? Want some of my ass?

- Herve, I remember you

Oh, yeah,

I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together sometime this week.

- Sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.

- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?

Uh, well, actually,
this is just a shot in the dark,

but, uh, there's no chance
that you're pre-law, is there?

What the fuck
do you want?

Well, what the fuck
do you want?

357
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:54,641
I've spoken to the judge,
and he's agreed to release you
under my supervision.

358
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:57,102
- Really?
- Yeah.

359
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,069
- Under two conditions.
- What are those?

360
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:07,780
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

361
00:27:07,863 --> 00:27:11,158
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on,

362
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:16,038
get into
some more advanced...

363
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:19,041
combinatorial mathematics,

364
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,126
finite math.

365
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,214
Sounds like a real hoot.

366
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,843
And the second condition
is that--

367
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:32,262
that you see a therapist.

368
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,436
I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

369
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:44,483
If you fail to meet with any of those
conditions, you will have to serve time.

370
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:49,071
All right. I'll do the math,
but I'm not gonna meet
with any fuckin' therapist.

00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:37,192
- I told you to cooperate
with these people.
- Look...

443
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:39,695
- into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

444
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:42,281
I don't need therapy.

445
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:46,201
- That's enough. Get out!
- [ Imitating Spooky Sound ]

446
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:50,414
- I called Mel Weintraub
this morning to see--
- Oh, what's the use?

447
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:52,458
What do you want to do?

448
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:59,089
- [ Sighs ] Well, there's someone.
- Who is he?

449
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:04,636
He used to be my, uh--
my roommate in college.

450
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:12,102
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

451
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:14,146
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

452
00:33:14,229 --> 00:33:17,024
Why is trust
the most important thing...

453
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:21,487
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

454
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:26,075
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

455
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,828
- Vinnie.
- Um--

456
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:32,831
Because, uh--

457
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,876
Trust is, uh--
Trust is life.

458
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:39,588
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

459
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,424
[ Professor ] Next time,
get the notes from your brother.

460
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:45,928
If a patient doesn't feel
safe enough trust you, then
they won't be honest with you.

461
00:33:45,928 --> 00:33:48,097
Then there's really no point
for them being in therapy.

462
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,267
I mean, hey, if they don't
trust you, you're never gonna
get them to sleep with you.

463
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:55,354
That should be the goal
of any good therapist. Nail 'em
while they're vulnerable.

464
00:33:55,437 --> 00:33:57,106
That's my motto.

465
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:59,733
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

466
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:04,863
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

467
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:12,162
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

468
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:16,208
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

469
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,086
- Hello.
- Anyone know what
the Field's medal is?

470
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,922
It's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

471
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:27,094
Except they only give it out once
every four years. It's a great thing.

472
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:30,222
It's an amazing honor.
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.

473
00:34:30,264 --> 00:34:33,726
Thanks. We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

474
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:37,104
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

475
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:41,608
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

476
00:34:41,734 --> 00:34:43,652
Good to see you.

477
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:47,322
- Sean, I think I got something
interesting for ya.
- Yeah?

478
00:34:47,448 --> 00:34:49,867
What, you have to have
blood and urine? What's up?

479
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,286
Why didn't you come
to the reunion?

480
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:55,831
You know, I'm--
I've been busy.

481
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:57,833
- You were missed.
- Really?

482
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:02,254
- So how long has it been
since we've seen each other?
- Before Nancy died.

483
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:04,214
Yeah, I'm sorry.

484
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,967
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

485
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:08,719
I got your card.
It was nice.

[ Grunting ]

487
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:16,060
- Come here.
- Now that's a takedown.

488
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:20,105
Hey, what happened?
Did you get leniency or what?

489
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:24,860
I got, uh, probation
and then counseling two days a week.

490
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:28,655

Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

- [ Chuckling ]

Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

493
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,953
- I've got a full schedule.
I'm very busy.
- Sean, Sean.

494
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:38,082
This-This boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

495
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:41,543
What makes him
so incredible, Gerry?

496
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:45,631
- You ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

497
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:50,552
It's a man. He lived
over 100 years ago. He was Indian.

498
00:35:50,594 --> 00:35:53,430
- Dots, not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

499
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:55,474
He lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

500
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:57,935
He had no formal education.

501
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:00,521
- He had no access
to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

502
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:02,898
- You, sir?
- Just a little.

503
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,317
But he came across
this old math book,

504
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:08,028
and from the simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

505
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:09,988
that had baffled
mathematicians for years.

506
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes. Continued fractions.
He wrote, uh--

507
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:17,371
- Well, he mailed it
to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.

508
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:20,707
- And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,378
and brought him over to England,
and then they worked together for years,

510
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:26,964
creating some of the most
exciting math theory ever done.

511
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,383
This-This Ramanujan--

512
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:33,429
his-his genius
was unparalleled, Sean.

513
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,932
- Well, this boy's just like that.
- Hmm.

514
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:40,561
- But he's-- he's a bit defensive.
- Hmm.

515
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:42,646
I need someone
who can get through to him.

516
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:46,233
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

517
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:49,403
- Why?
- Well, because you have
the same kind of background.

518
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:52,740
- What background?
- Well, you're from
the same neighborhood.

519
00:36:52,781 --> 00:36:56,118
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

520
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,996
Boy genius from Southie.

521
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,208
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

522
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:07,755
- Let me guess.
Barry? Henry? Not Rick?
- Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:10,966
- Sean, please, just meet
with him once a week.
- Mm-hmm.

524
00:37:10,966 --> 00:37:12,926
Please?

525
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:19,183
It's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

526
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:22,311
He probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

527
00:37:22,436 --> 00:37:24,813
It's gonna be hard
for him to find.

- Hi.

- Yeah. Let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

Let's let the healing begin.

- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:45,125
You, too, Gerry.

535
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:47,127
Yeah, of course.

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,468
- How are you?
- [ Door Closes ]

00:37:59,014 --> 00:38:01,809
-l like what you've done with the place.
-Oh, thanks.

539
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:04,103
Do you buy all these books
retail,

540
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:08,273
or do you send away for, like,
a "shrink kit" that comes with
all these volumes included?

541
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:11,985
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

542
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:14,196
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

543
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,990
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

544
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:20,786
What about the ones
on the top shelf? You read those?

545
00:38:20,828 --> 00:38:24,790
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you
think about 'em?

546
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:27,709
I'm not here for a fuckin' book
report. They're your books.
Why don't you read 'em?

547
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:29,628
I did. I had to.

- Yeah, it did.

Jesus. If you wanna read

- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

You surround yourselves with 'em.

shoving that cigarette up your ass.

- No, free weights.

- Yeah. Yeah, big time.

- Just like that.

- 285. What do you bench?

You paint that?

- Yeah. Do you paint?
- Uh-uh.

- Do you sculpt?
- No.

Oh, tell me what
you really think.

572
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:05,182
Just the linear and impressionistic mix
makes a very muddled composition.

573
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:09,478
It's also a Winslow Homer
rip-off, except you got
whitey rowin' the boat there.

574
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:11,438
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

575
00:40:11,563 --> 00:40:13,982
- That's not really
what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

576
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:16,527
-Just the coloring.
-You know what the real bitch of it is?

577
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,695
It's paint-by-number.

578
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:21,240
Is it color-by-number? Because
the colors are fascinating to me.

579
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,783
- Aren't they really?
- You bet.

580
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:26,537
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

Think I should move to the south of
France, change my name to "Vincent"?

- You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?
- Yeah.

584
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:38,382
- Yeah, maybe that means you.
- In what way?

585
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:41,927
- Maybe you're in the middle
of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you.

It's wonderful stuff, you know? Little things like that.

Those little idiosyncrasies that only I knew about.

That's what made her my wife.

This girl you met, she isn't perfect either.

That's the whole deal. That's what intimacy is all about.

01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:53,944
- Will. - Wow.

894
01:02:53,986 --> 01:02:57,781
- Do you still see all of them? - Yeah, well, they all live in Southie.

895
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,493
-I'm livin' with three of 'em right now. -Oh, yeah?

896
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,077
- Yeah. - I'd like to meet them.

897
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:04,497
Yeah, we'll do that.

898
01:03:04,705 --> 01:03:07,124
Oh, you know, I read your book last night.

899
01:03:07,124 --> 01:03:09,710
- Oh, so you're the one. - [ Laughs ]

900
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:11,712
Do you still, uh-- Do you still counsel veterans?

901
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:13,130
No, I don't.

902
01:03:13,214 --> 01:03:17,885
- Why not? - Well, I gave it up when my wife got sick.

903
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:23,474
You ever wonder what your life would be like if you, uh, if you never met your wife?

904
01:03:23,516 --> 01:03:25,434
What? Wonder if I'd be better off without her?

905
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,686
- No, no, no, I'm not saying, like, better off. - No.

906
01:03:27,728 --> 01:03:31,690
- I didn't mean it like that. - It's all right. It's an important question.

907
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:34,068
'Cause you'll have bad times, but that'll always wake you up...

908
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:36,403
to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to.

909
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:39,031
And you don't regret meetin' your wife?

910
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:41,867
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

911
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:47,289
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't regret a single day I spent with her.

912
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:54,505
So when did you know, like, that she was the one for you?

913
01:03:54,588 --> 01:03:57,299
October 21, 1975.

914
01:03:57,299 --> 01:03:59,510
Jesus Christ. You know the fuckin' day?

915
01:03:59,552 --> 01:04:04,557
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

916
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,728
- Yeah, sure. - My friends and I had slept out all night to get tickets.

917
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:13,274
- You got tickets? - Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar,

918
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:16,861
waitin' for the game to start and in walks this girl.

919
01:04:16,944 --> 01:04:20,322
It was an amazing game though. You know, bottom of the eighth, Carbo ties it up.

920
01:04:20,364 --> 01:04:22,491
It was 6-6. It went to 12.

921
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:26,453
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton Fisk, old Pudge.

922
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,581
Steps up to the plate. You know, he's got that weird stance.

923
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:32,209
- Yeah, yeah. - And then-- Boom! He clocks it, you know.

924
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:34,962
High fly ball down the left field line!

925
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,590
Thirty-five thousand people on their feet, yellin' at the ball.

926
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,176
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk, he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

927
01:04:40,259 --> 01:04:42,178
- Yeah, I've seen that. - "Get over! Get over!

928
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:43,679
- Right. - Get over!"

929
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:48,184
Then it hits the foul pole. He goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans--

930
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:50,311
They charge the field, you know.

931
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,730
Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.

932
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,982
"Get outta the way! Get outta the way!"

933
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:58,152
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to that fuckin' game!

934
01:04:58,152 --> 01:05:01,280
- Did you rush the field? - No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field. I wasn't there.

935
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:04,408
- What? - No, I was in a bar, havin' a drink with my future wife.

936
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:09,079
You missed Pudge Fisk's home run to have a fuckin' drink with some lady you never met?

937
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,332
Yeah, but you should have seen her. She was a stunner.

938
01:05:11,373 --> 01:05:13,918
- I don't care if-- - Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

939
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:17,004
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room. - Oh, Helen of Troy!

940
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,215
That's game six! Oh, my God, and who were these friends of yours?

941
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,592
- They let you get away with that? - They had to.

942
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:25,262
-What did you say to 'em? -l just slid my ticket across the table.

943
01:05:25,346 --> 01:05:28,432
I said, "Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl."

944
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,684
- "I gotta go see about a girl"? - Yes!

945
01:05:30,684 --> 01:05:32,770
That's what you said? They let you get away with that?

946
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:34,855
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes that I meant it.

947
01:05:35,022 --> 01:05:38,859
- You're kiddin' me? - No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

948
01:05:38,859 --> 01:05:41,570
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

949
01:05:41,612 --> 01:05:44,073
and how I always regretted not goin' over and talkin' to her.

950
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:47,284
I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy.

951
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:50,371
I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick,

952
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:54,166
and I don't regret the last years when she got really sick.

953
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:56,919
And I sure as hell don't regret missin' a damn game.

954
01:05:57,002 --> 01:05:59,713
That's regret.

955
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:02,091
Wow!

956
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:07,054
[ Sighs ]

957
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,723
Would have been nice to catch that game though.

958
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:12,393
I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit a home run.

959
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:14,395
[ Both Laughing ]

960
01:06:14,478 --> 01:06:18,524
You know, I'm very, very useful on the court.

961
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:21,652
I'm extremely tall.

962
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,613
- You're not that tall. - I dunk.

963
01:06:26,157 --> 01:06:30,828
- [ Rattling ] - Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

964
01:06:30,828 --> 01:06:34,373
"It is decidedly so." Hmph.

965
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:39,461
Why do we always stay here?

966
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:42,173
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

967
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:44,717
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

968
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,052
I know. [ Laughs ]

969
01:06:47,094 --> 01:06:49,597
When am I gonna meet your friends and your brothers?

970
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,100
Well, they don't really come down here that much.

971
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:55,311
I think I can make it to South Boston.

972
01:06:55,394 --> 01:07:00,065
It's kind of a hike.

973
01:07:00,232 --> 01:07:03,110
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?

974
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:05,738
- All right, we'll go. - When?

975
01:07:05,779 --> 01:07:08,240
I don't know. We'll go sometime next week.

976
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,746
What if I said I would not sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?

977
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,335
[ Groans ]

978
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:23,088
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'. They're probably up.

979
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:26,467
Oh, my God. Men are shameless.

980
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:30,846
If you're not thinking with your wiener, then you're acting directly on its behalf.

981
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,433
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener, can I get an advance payment?

982
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:39,271
I don't know. Let's ask. "Outlook does not look good."

983
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:42,691
- [ Chuck On Phone ] What? - Fuck the-- Hey, Chuck. No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.

984
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:45,986
"Outlook"? That's the same thing that told you you was gonna play in the N.B.A.

985
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:50,157
Exactly, so look out. You'd better start buying some season tickets.

986
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:54,995
Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall. I like wearing shorts.

987
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,331
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

988
01:07:57,331 --> 01:08:00,167
- You're not that tall. - Yes, I am.

989
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:03,295
Maybe I'm all about three points.

990
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,631
I'm all about home runs.

991
01:08:05,673 --> 01:08:09,885
[ Laughs ] Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

992
01:08:13,013 --> 01:08:15,808
[ Laughing ]

993
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,984
A leprechaun's got his dick in the monkey's ass.

994
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:28,821
Morgan comes runnin' in, goin', "l don't mind it. I don't mind--"

995
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:30,906
[ Laughing ]

996
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:34,618
Well, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

997
01:08:34,702 --> 01:08:37,997
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity we'd be all drinkin'.

998
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:40,958
My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

999
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,878
Did I ever tell ya what happened to him when he was drivin' up there and got pulled over?

1000
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:46,172
- I told you guys, right? - Marty, yeah.

1001
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:49,842
Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle Marty, because you oughta know this.

1002
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:53,304
He's always tellin' stories. Every time we come here he's got another story.

1003
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:57,391
But we all heard this one. Go ahead. Say it anyway.

1004
01:08:57,391 --> 01:09:02,563
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot. Guess I have the floor now.

1005
01:09:02,563 --> 01:09:05,316
My uncle Marty's drivin' home, right?

1006
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:10,154
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.

1007
01:09:10,196 --> 01:09:14,366
This state trooper sees him, pulls him over. So my uncle's fucked basically.

1008
01:09:14,492 --> 01:09:16,660
Got him out of the car, tryin' to make him walk the line.

1009
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:20,581
He gets out of the car, pukes, and the statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

1010
01:09:20,664 --> 01:09:24,460
So he's about to throw the cuffs on him and put him in jail.

1011
01:09:24,585 --> 01:09:28,547
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road, there's this huge fuckin' boom.

1012
01:09:28,672 --> 01:09:32,134
- Statie gets real spooked. He turns around-- - He got shot?

1013
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,221
No. So-- So-- You heard this story before.

1014
01:09:35,262 --> 01:09:37,181
Yeah, Morgan, stop. Stop.

1015
01:09:37,181 --> 01:09:40,601
Some other guy's car had hit a tree. There was an accident.

1016
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:42,603
[ Coughs ] Anyway--

1017
01:09:42,686 --> 01:09:44,814
- How could he hear-- - Shut the fuck up!

1018
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:47,858
- You're drivin' him nuts. - I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!

1019
01:09:47,942 --> 01:09:49,902
He told you the story once before.

1020
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:52,655
So he tells my uncle, "Stay here. Don't move."

1021
01:09:52,696 --> 01:09:56,659
Statie goes runnin' down the road to deal with the other accident.

1022
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,663
After a few minutes of just lyin' in his own piss and vomit,

1023
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:02,748
my uncle starts wonderin' what he's doin' there.

1024
01:10:02,748 --> 01:10:05,334
Gets up, gets in his car and just drives home.

1025
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,462
The next mornin' my uncle's just passed out.

1026
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:10,714
- He hears this knockin' at the door. - [ Knocking ]

1027
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:13,759
So he goes downstairs, pulls the door open-- "What?"

1028
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,803
It's the state trooper that pulled him over.

1029
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:17,847
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What?'

1030
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:21,392
You know what. I pulled you over last night is what, and you took off."

1031
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:23,978
He's like, "l never seen you before in my life.

1032
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,772
I've been home all night with my kids. I don't know who the fuck you are."

1033
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:30,192
He's like, "You know who I am. Let me get in your garage."

1034
01:10:30,234 --> 01:10:32,611
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You heard me. Let me get in your garage."

1035
01:10:32,653 --> 01:10:35,281
He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes him out to the garage, opens the door.

1036
01:10:35,406 --> 01:10:40,619
And there's-- The statie's police cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

1037
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:43,205
- [ Morgan Laughing ] - He was so fuckin'--

1038
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:45,666
He was so fuckin' hammered he drove the wrong car home.

1039
01:10:45,749 --> 01:10:49,545
The best part about it is, the fuckin' state trooper...

1040
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,047
was so embarrassed he didn't do anything.

1041
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:55,467
He'd been drivin' around all night in my uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.

1042
01:10:55,509 --> 01:10:59,597
All right, Chuck, what the fuck is the point of your story?

1043
01:10:59,597 --> 01:11:01,849
He got away. That's the point.

1044
01:11:01,932 --> 01:11:05,144
- Well, question-- - Come on. Stop.

1045
01:11:05,186 --> 01:11:08,022
- I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'. - You're embarrassing him.

1046
01:11:08,022 --> 01:11:10,524
- It doesn't make any sense. - It does make sense,

1047
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,610
if you listen to the story and quit askin' questions.

1048
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:15,988
Well, let's see if you can get this one. I've got a little story for you.

1049
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:20,784
All right, there's an old couple in bed, Mary and Paddie.

1050
01:11:20,868 --> 01:11:26,415
They wake up on the morning of their 50th anniversary.

1051
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:29,627
Mary looks over and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

1052
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,754
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie.

1053
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,089
You're such a good-looking feller. I love ya.

1054
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:36,550
I want to give ya a little present.

1055
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:39,553
Anything your little heart desires, I'm goin' to give it to ya.

1056
01:11:39,637 --> 01:11:41,555
What would ya like?

1057
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:46,310
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary. That's a very sweet offer.

1058
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:51,315
Now, in 50 years, there's one thing that's been missing,

1059
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,152
and, uh, I would like you to give me a blow job.

1060
01:11:55,236 --> 01:11:58,906
I would like for it." Mary's like, "All right."

1061
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:03,410
She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in the glass. She gives him a blow job.

1062
01:12:03,494 --> 01:12:07,414
Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

1063
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:11,418
That was the most beautiful, earth-shattering thing ever!

1064
01:12:11,418 --> 01:12:13,754
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

1065
01:12:13,879 --> 01:12:16,841
Is there anything that I can do for you?"

1066
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:21,512
Mary looks up to him and she goes, "Give us a kiss."

1067
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:23,931
- Oh! - Oh, my God!

1068
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:27,309
- That's filthy. - It's not that filthy. I've heard filthy.

[ Laughing ]

1070
01:12:31,772 --> 01:12:35,693
- Get off of me! - All right. See you guys later.

1071
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,071
All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1072
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,615
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1073
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:43,659
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1074
01:12:43,701 --> 01:12:47,204
You don't want to rush to judgment on that one, 'cause they're not all like me.

1075
01:12:47,288 --> 01:12:50,040
Oh. I'm sure. It was nice to meet ya.

1076
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:52,710
- Oh. - Take it easy. Slowly back away.

1077
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:56,881
- Oh, come on. Brother. - I don't know what you're doin', dude.

1078
01:12:56,964 --> 01:12:59,633
- You're givin' us a ride. - What the fuck do I look like to you?

1079
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:03,095
- Come on, Chuck. - You're walkin', bitch. Will's takin' the car.

1080
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:06,432
All right, thanks, sucker. I appreciate it.

1081
01:13:06,474 --> 01:13:09,435
I don't know what you're gettin' all serious about.

1082
01:13:09,477 --> 01:13:13,397
- You're droppin' me off first. - It's really out of the way.

1083
01:13:13,481 --> 01:13:16,358
Oh, okay. Just 'cause you don't have to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1084
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,319
don't start thinkin' you're bad.

1085
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:20,654
Hey, wait a minute. You said we were gonna see your place.

1086
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:23,949
- Not tonight. - Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night.

1087
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:27,536
He knows once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1088
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:29,622
But I wanted to meet your brothers.

1089
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:32,166
We're gonna do that another time.

1090
01:13:32,249 --> 01:13:34,168
All right.

1091
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:38,422
Need them keys.

1092
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:42,468
The stewardess hears this and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1093
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:45,846
I yell, "Don't forget the coffee."

1094
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:47,890
No shit! You didn't say that.

1095
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:50,476
For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.

1096
01:13:50,518 --> 01:13:52,686
- I know someone that actually happened to, Marty. - A joke.

1097
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,396
- Gerry. - Hi.

1098
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:56,398
- Have trouble findin' the place? - No, I took a cab.

1099
01:13:56,482 --> 01:14:00,361
Timmy, this is Gerry. We went to college together.

1100
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,571
How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.

1101
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:04,573
- Pleased to meet you. - Can I get you a beer?

Um, no, just a Perrier.

That's French for club soda.

01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,831
- Club soda, yeah. - Couple of sandwiches too.

1105
01:14:11,872 --> 01:14:13,791
- Sure. - Put it on my tab.

1106
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:16,168
You ever plannin' on payin' your tab?

1107
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:18,420
Yeah, chief, got the winning lottery ticket right here.

1108
01:14:18,462 --> 01:14:20,172
- What's the jackpot? - Twelve million.

1109

- I don't think that'll cover it. - It'll cover your sex change operation.

- Nuts? - No, thank you.

1111
01:14:34,645 --> 01:14:37,815
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1112
01:14:37,857 --> 01:14:41,652
- Well, it seems to be going well. - I think so.

1113
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:45,948
Have you talked to him at all about his future?

1114
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:49,785
No, we haven't gotten into that yet. We're still bangin' away at the past.

1115
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:53,330
Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.

1116
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:57,293
- What kind? - Cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1117
01:14:57,376 --> 01:15:00,713
The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free rein.

1118
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:06,427
That's great that there are offers, but I don't really think he's ready for that.

1119
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:12,433
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

- Thanks, Tim. - Yeah, thank you.

Just so you don't get sticky fingers.

Tim, can you help us?

1124
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:25,946
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

Uh-oh.

01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:30,910
- Ever heard of Jonas Salk? - Sure. Cured polio.

01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:42,963
- No. - Thank you, Tim.

1131
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,965
- So who won the bet? - I did.

1132
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:51,430
This isn't about me, Sean.

1133
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,391
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1134
01:15:57,895 --> 01:15:59,855
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1135
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:04,527
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors renown for their study of the universe.

1136
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:09,198
But it was a 26-year-old Swiss patent clerk,

1137
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,826
doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world.

1138
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:13,869
Can you imagine if Einstein would have given that up...

1139
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:16,413
just to get drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night.

1140
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:19,166
We all would have lost something.

1141
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,252
Tim would never have heard of him.

1142
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:24,380
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry. - No, it isn't, Sean.

1143
01:16:24,421 --> 01:16:27,049
This boy has that gift.

1144
01:16:27,174 --> 01:16:29,635
He just doesn't got the direction, but we can give that to him.

1145
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:35,057
Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s, there was a young man graduated from University of Michigan.

1146
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,352
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1147
01:16:38,435 --> 01:16:40,855
Specifically, bounded harmonic functions.

1148
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,983
Then he went on to Berkeley. He was assistant professor. Showed amazing potential.

1149
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,986
Then he moved to Montana, and he blew the competition away.

1150
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:49,947
- Yeah, so who was he? - Ted Kaczynski.

1151
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,907
Haven't heard of him.

1152
01:16:51,991 --> 01:16:53,951
- Hey, Timmy! - Yo!

1153
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:56,787
- Who's Ted Kaczynski? - Unabomber.

1154
01:16:58,664 --> 01:17:01,709
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1155
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,752
- We gotta give this kid direction. - Yeah--

1156
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:06,172
He can contribute to the world, and we can help him do that.

1157
01:17:06,172 --> 01:17:08,257
Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another.

1158
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:11,260
- Sean-- - We have to let him find--

1159
01:17:11,343 --> 01:17:14,096
I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan...

1160
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:16,098
to ruin this boy's life!

1161
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,559
I was doing advanced mathematics when I was 18,

1162
01:17:18,642 --> 01:17:21,103
and it still took me over 20 years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.

1163
01:17:21,228 --> 01:17:23,564
Maybe he doesn't want what you want.

1164
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:26,484
There's more to life than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1165
01:17:26,525 --> 01:17:30,488
This is too important, Sean, and it's above personal rivalry.

1166
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:32,948
Wait a minute. Let's talk about the boy.

1167
01:17:33,032 --> 01:17:35,743
Why don't we give him time to figure out what he wants?

1168
01:17:35,826 --> 01:17:39,079
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1169
01:17:39,163 --> 01:17:41,790
Yeah, it did, you arrogant fuckin' prick!

1170
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:46,629
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I came here today.

1171
01:17:46,712 --> 01:17:48,923
I came here out of courtesy. I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1172
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,050
Nice to be in the loop.

1173
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,762
The boy's in a meeting right now I set up for him over at McNeil.

1174
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:59,225
Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

1175
01:17:59,266 --> 01:18:01,685
We've already offered you a position.

1176
01:18:01,769 --> 01:18:03,771
Nobody in this town works without a retainer, guys.

1177
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:07,149
You think you can find somebody who does, you have my blessin'.

1178
01:18:07,191 --> 01:18:10,402
But I think we all know that person is not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1179
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:13,656
Will, our offer is $84,000 a year.

You want us to give you cash right now?

1182
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:25,459
Whoa-ho-ho. Easy-- Now, I didn't say that.

1183
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:30,714
Allegedly, your situation, for you,

1184
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,677

1339
01:29:17,888 --> 01:29:20,265
I think you could show me some appreciation.

1340
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:24,728
A little appreciation? Do you know how easy this is for me?

1341

Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1342

I'm sorry you can't do this-- I really am--

Because I wouldn't have to fuckin' sit here and watch you fumble around and fuck it up.

1344

Then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

You're right. This is probably a total waste of my time.

We don't like to brag about that, Will, but you're exactly right.

1387
01:32:39,422 --> 01:32:43,301
So the way I see it, the question isn't:

1388
01:32:43,426 --> 01:32:46,054
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1389
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:48,598
The question is: "Why shouldn't you?"

1390

Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1391
01:32:52,644 --> 01:32:56,606
That's a tough one, but I'll take a shot.

1392
01:32:56,648 --> 01:32:59,401
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A. and somebody puts a code on my desk.

1393
01:32:59,442 --> 01:33:01,403
Something no one else can break.

1394
01:33:01,486 --> 01:33:03,405
Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it.

1395
01:33:03,446 --> 01:33:05,991
I'm real happy with myself because I did my job well.

1396
01:33:06,074 --> 01:33:09,661
But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or Middle East.

1397
01:33:09,703 --> 01:33:12,789
Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1398
01:33:12,831 --> 01:33:17,043
Fifteen hundred people that I never met, never had no problem with, get killed.

1399
01:33:17,169 --> 01:33:20,130
Now the politicians are saying, "Send in the Marines to secure the area,"

'cause they don't give a shit.

1401
01:33:22,174 --> 01:33:24,092
It won't be their kid over there gettin' shot,

1402
01:33:24,134 --> 01:33:27,095
just like it wasn't them when their number got called 'cause they were in the National Guard.

1403
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:30,140
It'll be some kid from Southie over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1404
01:33:30,182 --> 01:33:32,142
He comes back to find the plant he used to work at...

1405
01:33:32,225 --> 01:33:34,728
got exported to the country he got back from,

1406
01:33:34,769 --> 01:33:37,147
and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job...

1407
01:33:37,147 --> 01:33:40,025
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day and no bathroom breaks.

1408
01:33:40,108 --> 01:33:42,694
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place...

1409
01:33:42,777 --> 01:33:45,906
was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price.

1410
01:33:45,947 --> 01:33:49,993
Of course, the oil companies used a skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1411
01:33:50,076 --> 01:33:54,164
A cute little ancillary benefit for them, but it ain't helpin' my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.

1412
01:33:54,247 --> 01:33:56,625
They're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil, of course.

1413
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:58,752
Maybe they even took the liberty to hire an alcoholic skipper,

1414
01:33:58,877 --> 01:34:02,047
who likes to drink martinis and fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1415
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:04,382
It ain't too long till he hits one, spills the oil...

1416
01:34:04,466 --> 01:34:06,927
and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic.

1417

So now my buddy's out of work, he can't afford to drive,

so he's walkin' to the fuckin' job interviews...

1419
01:34:11,348 --> 01:34:14,100
which sucks because the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.

1420
01:34:14,184 --> 01:34:16,770
Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat,

1421
01:34:16,812 --> 01:34:18,772
the only blue plate special they're servin'...

1425
01:34:30,784 --> 01:34:32,744
take his job, give it to his sworn enemy,

hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal,

- Not without some serious smelling salts and a heater. - That's what I'm saying.

1442

- Playtime's over, okay? - Why are you kickin' me out?

1483

You're lecturin' me on life? Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

- What winds your clock? - Workin' with you.

Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk about soul mates? Where is she?

1486
01:37:39,514 --> 01:37:41,683
- Dead. - That's right. She's fuckin' dead.

1487
01:37:41,725 --> 01:37:44,478
She fuckin' dies and you just cash in your chips and you walk away?

1488
01:37:44,519 --> 01:37:48,732
- At least I played a hand. - You played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1489
01:37:48,773 --> 01:37:52,194
Some people will lose a big hand like that and have the sack to ante up again.

1490
01:37:52,235 --> 01:37:55,405
Look at me. What do you wanna do?

1491
01:38:02,287 --> 01:38:06,541
You and your bullshit. You got a bullshit answer for everybody.

1492
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:10,295
But I ask you a very simple question and you can't give me a straight answer,

1493
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:14,382
because you don't know.

1494

I'll see ya, Bo-peep.

Med school. Medical school in California.

- Really? - Yeah.

- When was this? - It was, like, a week ago.

That sucks.

1544

So, uh, when are you done with those meetings?

Nah, probably make some nice bank though.

Better than this shit. Way outta here.

1551

What do I want a way outta here for?

1552

I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here the rest of my life.

1553

You know, be neighbors. You know, have little kids.

But in 20 years if you're still livin' here,

1557
01:42:12,829 --> 01:42:16,166
comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games,

1558
01:42:16,249 --> 01:42:18,543
still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1559
01:42:18,668 --> 01:42:21,171
That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.

What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1561
01:42:23,507 --> 01:42:26,676
- Look, you got something none of us have. - Oh, come on!

1562
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:30,639
Why is it always this? I fuckin' owe it to myself to do this or that.

1563
01:42:30,806 --> 01:42:34,851
- What if I don't want to? - No, no, no. Fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself.

1564
01:42:34,976 --> 01:42:37,145
You owe it to me,

1565
01:42:37,187 --> 01:42:39,856
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be 50,

1566
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,359
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1567
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,986
That's all right. That's fine.

1568
01:42:45,112 --> 01:42:47,656
I mean, you're sittin' on a winnin' lottery ticket.

1569
01:42:47,739 --> 01:42:51,409
You're too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1570
01:42:53,453 --> 01:42:56,331
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything to have what you got.

1571
01:42:56,414 --> 01:42:59,376
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1572
01:42:59,417 --> 01:43:02,045
Be an insult to us if you're still here in 20 years.

1573
01:43:02,129 --> 01:43:04,631
Hangin' around here is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1574
01:43:04,756 --> 01:43:06,883
- You don't know that. - I don't?

1575
01:43:06,967 --> 01:43:10,470
- No. You don't know that. - Oh, I don't know that. Let me tell you what I do know.

1576
01:43:10,512 --> 01:43:14,391
Every day I come by your house, and I pick you up.

1577
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:18,478
We go out and have a few drinks and few laughs, and it's great.

1578
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:21,231
You know what the best part of my day is?

1579
01:43:21,273 --> 01:43:25,694
It's for about ten seconds: from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door.

1580
01:43:25,819 --> 01:43:30,449
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there.

1581
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:34,035
No "good-bye," no "see ya later." No nothing. You just left.

1582
01:43:34,035 --> 01:43:38,373
I don't know much, but I know that.

[ Mutters ]

1584
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:53,263
This is a disaster, Sean.

1585
01:43:53,346 --> 01:43:55,682
I brought you in here because I wanted you to help me with the boy,

1586
01:43:55,682 --> 01:43:57,726
- not to run him out. - I know what I'm doing with the boy.

1587
01:43:57,851 --> 01:43:59,769
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy!

1588
01:43:59,853 --> 01:44:02,522
I don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1589
01:44:02,522 --> 01:44:05,317
- But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here. - Undermine?

1590
01:44:05,358 --> 01:44:07,444
This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1591
01:44:07,569 --> 01:44:10,530
I do understand. He is at a fragile point. He's got problems.

1592
01:44:10,572 --> 01:44:14,159
What problems does he have? That he's better off as a janitor, in jail?

1593
01:44:14,242 --> 01:44:17,329
Better hanging out with a bunch of retarded gorillas?

1594
01:44:17,412 --> 01:44:21,374
Why do you think he does that? You have any fuckin' clue why?

1595
01:44:21,458 --> 01:44:25,003
He can handle the problems. He can handle the work. He obviously handled you.

1596
01:44:25,128 --> 01:44:27,631
Listen to me. Why is he hiding?

1597
01:44:27,714 --> 01:44:29,633
Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1598
01:44:29,716 --> 01:44:31,593
Because the first thing that happened to him,

1599
01:44:31,718 --> 01:44:33,637
he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1600
01:44:33,762 --> 01:44:35,722
Don't give me that Freudian crap.

1601
01:44:35,847 --> 01:44:38,183
Why does he hang out with those retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1602
01:44:38,183 --> 01:44:41,812
Because any one of them, if he asked them to, would take a bat to your head.

1603
01:44:41,895 --> 01:44:44,815
- That's called loyalty. - Yeah, that's very touching.

1604
01:44:44,898 --> 01:44:48,068
Who's he handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him.

1605
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:50,654
It's a defense mechanism, all right?

1606
01:44:50,737 --> 01:44:53,448
For 20 years, he's been alone because of that.

1607
01:44:53,532 --> 01:44:56,243
If you push him right now, it's gonna be the same thing all over again.

1608
01:44:56,243 --> 01:44:58,203
I'm not gonna let that happen to him.

1609
01:44:58,328 --> 01:45:00,247
- Don't you do that. - What?

1610
01:45:00,288 --> 01:45:04,084
Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit, that it's okay to be a failure.

1611
01:45:04,126 --> 01:45:06,086
Because it's not okay, Sean!

1612
01:45:06,128 --> 01:45:09,923
And if you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--

1613
01:45:10,006 --> 01:45:12,801
- I'm not angry at you. - Oh, yes, you're angry at me.

1614
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:17,013
You resent me, but I'm not gonna apologize for any success I've had.

1615
01:45:17,139 --> 01:45:19,933
You're angry at me for doing what you could have done!

1616
01:45:19,975 --> 01:45:22,060
But ask yourself, Sean-- Ask yourself...

1617
01:45:22,102 --> 01:45:25,564
if you want Will to feel that way-- if you want him to feel like a failure?

1618
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:27,649
You arrogant shit!

1619
01:45:27,774 --> 01:45:32,154
That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions, 'cause I can't stand that look in your eye.

1620
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,282
- That condescending, embarrassed look. - Oh, come on, Sean.

1621
01:45:35,407 --> 01:45:37,367
You think I'm a failure. I know who I am.

1622
01:45:37,492 --> 01:45:41,955
I'm proud of what I do. It was a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!

1623
01:45:42,038 --> 01:45:44,833
And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case.

1624
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:48,462
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, "The Field's medal!"

1625
01:45:48,503 --> 01:45:51,923
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid of failure?

1626
01:45:51,965 --> 01:45:56,052
It's about my medal, isn't it? Oh, God, I could go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1627
01:45:56,136 --> 01:45:59,097
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1628
01:45:59,181 --> 01:46:01,183
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal,

1629
01:46:01,308 --> 01:46:03,226
because I knew you before you were a mathematical god,

1630
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:06,938
when you were pimple-faced and homesick and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1631
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,982
Yeah, you were smarter than me then and you're smarter than me now.

1632
01:46:09,065 --> 01:46:11,067
So don't blame me for how your life turned out.

1633
01:46:11,067 --> 01:46:13,487
I don't blame you! It's not about you!

1634
01:46:13,528 --> 01:46:16,323
You mathematical dick! It's about the boy!

1635
01:46:16,364 --> 01:46:21,369
He's a good kid! And I won't see you fuck him up like you're tryin' to fuck up me right now.

1636
01:46:21,453 --> 01:46:23,955
I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!

1637
01:46:24,039 --> 01:46:27,501
-He won't be a failure! -But if you push him! If you ride him!

1638
01:46:27,584 --> 01:46:33,215
I am what I am today because I was pushed and because I learned to push myself.

1639
01:46:33,298 --> 01:46:35,383
He's not you! You get that!

1640
01:46:37,552 --> 01:46:39,304
I can come back.

1641
01:46:39,429 --> 01:46:43,475
No, come in. Uh, I was just leaving.

1642
01:46:53,735 --> 01:46:57,697
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way between me and him.

1643
01:46:57,697 --> 01:46:59,783
You know. Not about you.

1644
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:06,540
- [ Paper Rustles ] - What is that?

1645
01:47:06,581 --> 01:47:10,919
This is your file. I have to send it back to the judge for evaluation.

1646
01:47:10,961 --> 01:47:16,133
Oh. Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1647
01:47:19,803 --> 01:47:22,055
What's it say?

1648
01:47:23,390 --> 01:47:26,059
- Wanna read it? - Why?

1649
01:47:27,769 --> 01:47:30,981
Have you had any, uh, experience with that?

1650
01:47:31,106 --> 01:47:34,651
Twenty years of counseling. Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1651
01:47:34,734 --> 01:47:39,072
I mean, have you had any experience with that?

1652
01:47:43,034 --> 01:47:46,580
- Personally? - Yeah.

1653
01:47:46,621 --> 01:47:48,540
Yeah, I have.

1654
01:47:48,665 --> 01:47:50,625
It sure ain't good.

1655
01:47:54,129 --> 01:47:56,256
My father was an alcoholic.

1656
01:47:56,298 --> 01:47:59,134
Mean fuckin' drunk.

1657
01:48:00,760 --> 01:48:03,805
He'd come home hammered, lookin' to whale on somebody.

1658
01:48:03,805 --> 01:48:08,351
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go after my mother and little brother.

1659
01:48:08,435 --> 01:48:12,606
Interesting nights when he wore his rings.

1660
01:48:13,648 --> 01:48:17,068
He used to just put a wrench,

1661
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:19,988
a stick and a belt on the table.

1662
01:48:20,113 --> 01:48:24,075
- Just say, "Choose." - Well, I gotta go with the belt there.

1663
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,119
I used to go with the wrench.

1664
01:48:26,161 --> 01:48:28,205
Why the wrench?

1665
01:48:28,246 --> 01:48:30,624
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1666
01:48:30,665 --> 01:48:34,294
- Your foster father? - Yeah.

1667
01:48:34,377 --> 01:48:38,256
So, uh, what is it, like, Will has an attachment disorder?

1668
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,634
Is it all that stuff?

1669
01:48:40,717 --> 01:48:43,637
Fear of abandonment?

1670
01:48:43,637 --> 01:48:46,681
Is that why I broke up with Skylar?

1671
01:48:46,848 --> 01:48:50,143
- I didn't know you had. - Yeah, I did.

1672
01:48:50,185 --> 01:48:54,189
- You wanna talk about it? - No.

1673
01:48:56,358 --> 01:49:02,197
Hey, Will, I don't know a lot.

1674
01:49:02,322 --> 01:49:05,700
You see this? All this shit?

1675
01:49:10,705 --> 01:49:12,791
It's not your fault.

1676
01:49:15,127 --> 01:49:17,212
[ Whispers ] Yeah, I know that.

1677
01:49:17,295 --> 01:49:20,298
Look at me, son.

1678
01:49:20,382 --> 01:49:23,885
- It's not your fault. - I know.

1679
01:49:23,969 --> 01:49:28,598
No. It's not your fault.

1680
01:49:28,682 --> 01:49:30,642
I know.

1681
01:49:30,684 --> 01:49:35,188
No, no, you don't. It's not your fault.

1682
01:49:35,313 --> 01:49:37,232
- Hmm? - I know.

1683
01:49:37,357 --> 01:49:40,068
- It's not your fault. - All right.

1684
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:42,612
It's not your fault.

1685
01:49:44,448 --> 01:49:49,744
- [ Whispers ] It's not your fault. - Don't fuck with me.

1686
01:49:49,744 --> 01:49:52,164
It's not your fault.

1687
01:49:52,247 --> 01:49:55,834
Don't fuck with me, all right? Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.

1688
01:49:55,834 --> 01:49:58,420
It's not your fault.

1689
01:50:01,006 --> 01:50:03,550
[ Sobs ]

1690
01:50:03,675 --> 01:50:07,721
- [ Sobs ] - [ Whispers ] It's not your fault.

1691
01:50:13,935 --> 01:50:17,063
My God--

1692
01:50:17,105 --> 01:50:21,777
My God! I'm so sorry! My God!

1693
01:50:32,329 --> 01:50:35,874
[ Sobbing Continues ]

1694
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:38,084
Fuck them, okay?

1695
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:50,198
[ Barking ]

1696
01:51:57,789 --> 01:51:59,916
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]

1697
01:52:01,877 --> 01:52:04,087
[ Chattering ]

1698
01:52:04,171 --> 01:52:08,216
- Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Will Hunting. I'm here about a position.

1699
01:52:08,341 --> 01:52:10,760
Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1700
01:52:14,306 --> 01:52:17,726
[ Man ] Yes, there's a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.

1701
01:52:37,788 --> 01:52:39,790
Which one did you take?

1702
01:52:39,915 --> 01:52:44,878
I was over at McNeil. It's one of the jobs the professor set me up with.

1703
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:49,299
I haven't told him yet, but I went down there and talked to my boss--

1704
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:52,761
My new boss. He seemed like a good guy.

1705
01:52:52,886 --> 01:52:58,225
- Is that what you want? - Yeah, you know, I think so.

1706
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:01,311
Well, good for you. Congratulations.

1707
01:53:01,436 --> 01:53:03,355
Thanks.

1708
01:53:06,483 --> 01:53:08,318
Time's up.

1709
01:53:11,363 --> 01:53:14,574
So that's-- So that's it? So we're done?

1710
01:53:14,658 --> 01:53:17,452
Yeah, that's it.

1711
01:53:17,494 --> 01:53:20,413
You're done. You're a free man.

1712
01:53:21,623 --> 01:53:26,378
Well, um, I just want you to know, Sean, that--

1713
01:53:26,503 --> 01:53:28,421
You're welcome, Will.

1714
01:53:33,635 --> 01:53:36,638
So, you know, I hope we keep in touch, you know.

1715
01:53:36,763 --> 01:53:39,182
Yeah, me too.

1716
01:53:39,266 --> 01:53:41,935
I'll be travelin' around a bit. It'll be a little hard, but, uh--

1717
01:53:41,977 --> 01:53:45,689
I've got an answering machine at the college I'll be checking in with.

1718
01:53:45,772 --> 01:53:49,568
So, here's the number.

1719
01:53:49,651 --> 01:53:53,530
You call that. I'll get back to you right away.

1720
01:53:53,572 --> 01:53:56,700
Yeah, you know, I figured I'm just gonna...

1721
01:53:56,741 --> 01:54:01,329
put my money back on the table and see what kind of cards I get.

1722
01:54:02,539 --> 01:54:05,584
You do what's in your heart, son. You'll be fine.

1723
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:12,215
- Thank you, Sean. - Uh--

1724
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:14,384
Thank you, Will.

1725
01:54:16,094 --> 01:54:19,389
Hey, does this violate the patient-doctor relationship?

1726
01:54:19,514 --> 01:54:21,641
Naw. Only if you grab my ass.

1727
01:54:25,437 --> 01:54:27,606
- Take care. - You too.

1728
01:54:27,773 --> 01:54:29,649
Yeah.

1729
01:54:31,443 --> 01:54:33,445
Hey.

1730
01:54:33,528 --> 01:54:35,906
Good luck, son.

1731
01:54:47,042 --> 01:54:49,795
[ Morgan ] Two beers.

1732
01:54:52,506 --> 01:54:54,549
What's up? Did you guys go?

1733
01:54:54,633 --> 01:54:56,968
No. I had to talk him down.

1734
01:54:57,093 --> 01:55:00,806
- Why didn't you yoke him? - Little Morgan's got a lot of scrap to him.

1735
01:55:00,806 --> 01:55:02,766
People try to whip his ass every week.

1736
01:55:02,808 --> 01:55:05,310
- Fuckin' kid won't back down. - What are you sayin' about me?

1737
01:55:05,352 --> 01:55:08,855
- Was I talkin' to you? None of your fuckin' business. - [ Door Opens ]

1738
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:12,192
- [ Chuckie ] Go get me a beer. - I ordered two beers!

1739
01:55:12,275 --> 01:55:14,277
- Hey, asshole. - What, bitch?

1740
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,156
-Happy birthday. -Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?

1741
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:20,826
- Come on! - I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1742
01:55:20,867 --> 01:55:22,744
All right. Who's first?

1743
01:55:22,911 --> 01:55:25,330
- Come on, motherfucker! - Who's first?

1744
01:55:25,455 --> 01:55:27,332
% Oh, Danny boy %%

1745
01:55:27,415 --> 01:55:30,919
Here's your present.

01:55:30,961 --> 01:55:33,004
- Come on, bro. - What?

1747
01:55:33,046 --> 01:55:37,342
Well, we knew you had to get back and forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1748
01:55:37,425 --> 01:55:41,304
I knew I wasn't gonna fuckin' drive you every day, so--

1749
01:55:41,346 --> 01:55:45,433
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass. - That's not what I was sayin'!

1750
01:55:45,517 --> 01:55:47,936
But, uh, you're 21 now.

1751
01:55:48,103 --> 01:55:51,690
You're legally allowed to drink, so we figured the best thing for ya was a car.

1752
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:54,192
- How do you like it? - This is like--

1753
01:55:56,611 --> 01:56:00,615
It's the ugliest fuckin' car I've ever seen in my life.

1754
01:56:00,657 --> 01:56:02,701
- Come on, brother. - How'd you guys do this?

1755
01:56:02,742 --> 01:56:07,706
You know, me and Bill scraped together the parts,

1756
01:56:07,747 --> 01:56:09,833
and Morgan was out panhandlin' for change every day.

1757
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:11,877
I had the router to do all the bodywork.

1758
01:56:11,877 --> 01:56:13,837
Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1759
01:56:13,879 --> 01:56:16,339
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1760
01:56:16,423 --> 01:56:18,508
So you finally got a job, huh, Morgan?

1761
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:20,719
- Yeah, had one. Now I'm fucked again. - So what is it?

1762
01:56:20,844 --> 01:56:24,514
- A lawn mower? What do ya got? - It's a straight fuckin' six.

1763
01:56:24,556 --> 01:56:26,558
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine ourselves here.

1764
01:56:26,558 --> 01:56:29,644
It's a good car. The engine's good. Engine's good.

1765
01:56:29,728 --> 01:56:33,023
- Happy 21, Will. - Happy 21, brother.

1766
01:56:40,155 --> 01:56:42,157
Hi.

1767
01:56:43,617 --> 01:56:45,619
Come on in.

1768
01:56:47,746 --> 01:56:49,706
Sean, l, um--

01:56:52,876 --> 01:56:55,253
Yeah. Good.

01:56:56,296 --> 01:56:58,423
I heard you're takin' some time.

1772
01:56:58,507 --> 01:57:03,094
Yeah. Travel a little bit, maybe write.

1773
01:57:03,178 --> 01:57:05,138
So where are you going?

1774
01:57:05,222 --> 01:57:09,226
India and China and Baltimore.

1775
01:57:10,477 --> 01:57:12,562
Oh.

1776
01:57:12,646 --> 01:57:14,606
You know when you'll be back?

1777
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:18,110
Oh. I got this flyer the other day.

1778
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:20,987
It says, uh, class of '72 is having a reunion in six months.
