1
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,516
What's up

2
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,633
I come to sit in.

3
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,692
You gonna help me with my losing streak?

4
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,898
- It's not possible, Bob.
- Maybe not, but you could give me the illusion.

5
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:49,907
The illusion. I've got plenty of that.

6
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,068
So how much does illusion cost?

7
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:55,807
- The usual.
- Got a prime here, Said. Should I stick with it?

8
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,874
- What's a prime?
- Special number. Divisible by itself and one.

9
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:04,286
- You're a mathematician, Bob?
- Yeah. Chaos theory.

10
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,987
- How much? I don't know.
- Two hundred?

11
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:14,055
- Want to gamble?
- You'd only lose.

12
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,161
- You spyin' on me, kid?
- No.

13
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,571
- I work here.
- Since when?

14
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:27,203
- Since last week.
- You're too young to work here.

15
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,271
- That's not what Remi says.
- Oh, I'm sure it's not.

16
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:33,477
Besides, you're too old to do that.

17
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:36,919
You're right. We're both lost souls.

18
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,049
- What age are you, kid?
- Seventeen.

19
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,923
Seventeen? Well, what do you know? Aprime.

20
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,963
What's a prime?

21
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,261
Special number, divisible
by one and itself.

22
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:52,394
Strange thing about primes is,
the further you get from ze...

23
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,872
- Hey, kid. Hey. Hey.
- Hmm?

24
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,433
Will you shut that door for me, please?

25
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,847
- Lesson over?
- For now.

26
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,865
He said he's taking you with him.
If he lets you book him...

27
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,730
they'll deport him to Algeria.

28
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:01,705
And he'd last two days.
He might as well die here as there.

29
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:07,378
He's gonna count to three.
If they don't drop those guns...

30
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,437
he's gonna blow your head off.

31
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,246
He said, "One. Two. Three.!"

32
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,720
You know, I swore I'd never share a needle.

33
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,897
- Why'd you do it?
- I thought you'd put a word in for him.

34
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:33,096
- Keep him in France. What would he get?
- Possession with intent.

35
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,504
- Five years.
- And for murdering a police officer?

36
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:38,099
- Throw away the key.
- There you go. That's why.

37
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,907
- You didn't do it for me, then, huh?
- You? Fuck you.

38
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,971
You're my worst nightmare. My bad angel.
How many times have you booked me?

39
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:46,745
I forget. But once more
and they throw away your key.

40
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:49,753
- Don't let it happen.
- Thanks for the lesson, schoolteacher. I'm clean.

41
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:03,434
You try a new scam, Bob, it won't be me.
The whole system will flatten you.

42
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:08,701
I've retired. I'm a junkie gambler now.
A big loser. That's all.

43
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,299
- Name the best thief that ever lived.
- Bob?

44
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,004
No. Pablo Picasso.

45
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,949
The cat stole from everybody: Rubens,
Delacroix, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Matisse.

46
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:23,454
- Never got caught. I met him once.
- I'm impressed.

47
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:27,822
A bullfight.
I bet on the bull, he bet on the matador.

48
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,589
The matador got 26 stitches.
I got a painting.

49
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,596
- Still have it.
- Then you're flush!

50
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:35,599
No, no, no. I'm broke. That never sells.

51
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:39,262
"Portrait ofJacqueline." Looked like her.

52
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,203
Just in from Moscow, huh?

53
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:43,741
Why don't you arrest her now?
Get it over with.

54
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,471
- Get what over with?
- The whole dreary cycle. She'll work the streets.

55
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,605
For her troubles, she'll end up in the river
with a needle in her arm.

56
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:52,445
- Go on, be a good cop.
- All I see is a girl on a motorbike.

57
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,849
Frisk them. You'll find a passport.

58
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,653
- There's a thing called the law. I don't see it being broken.
- Use your imagination.

59
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,169
You're looking for a replacement for Lydia?

60
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,231
- Stick to your cards, Bob.
- Who's Lydia?

61
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:21,109
Lydia's in the hospital.
She's been there quite a while.

62
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,979
- I said, stick to your game, okay?
- Yes, my game.

63
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,747
Problem with my game is
luck can fall both ways.

64
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,050
Whereas, with your game,
luck doesn't enter into it.

65
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,057
What's his game, Monsieur Bob?

66
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,423
It's as old as mine,
but he plays with girls from the sticks...

67
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:38,019
and the odds are all his his favor.

68
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:47,401
- I haven't had a hand like that since...
- What? Since when?

69
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,940
You fucking loser.

70
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,388
- Bosnia.
- I don't need a guardian.

71
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,556
- No?
- Maybe you do.

72
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,997
So, is that just bad makeup?

73
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,093
Oh, you got a thing about eyes.

74
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,161
Only when they're lucky.

75
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:24,473
So you protect the honor
of widows and orphans, huh?

76
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,773
Oh, you're not backward for your age.

77
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,813
Night school. He wasn't my pimp.

78
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,646
Oh, no? So what was he doing
with your passport?

79
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:40,016
- Okay. Five hundred on the corner pocket.
- Sure, Bob.

80
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,925
- Why do you call me Bob?
- Because you try to imitate him.

81
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:47,522
- Imitate that.
- Yvonne, turn that shit off and give us some french fries.

82
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,658
Paulo, Raoul. Anne.

83
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,101
- You want to shoot some pool?
- Not now. She looks hungry.

84
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,104
Oh, let me show her to a table.

85
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,106
- Smoking or not?
- Smoking.

86
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:58,199
Your dinner date is old
enough to be your father.

87
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,336
- You should try someone younger.
- I just left someone younger.

88
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,746
- Oh, why?
- He didn't live up to my ideal of manhood.

89
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:08,980
- But you haven't met me. Do you always sleep alone?
- Nearly always.

90
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,579
When she's not hanging out
at 5:00 in the morning eating french fries.

91
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,420
- With mayonnaise.
- Are you from Bosnia?

92
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,518
- So that's what it's called now.
- What brought you here?

93
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,529
Mayonnaise.

94
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,691
- 10:00. We're supposed to be at the bodega.
- Yeah.

95
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,702
- See you again.
- Why not?

96
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,203
Don't go giving that to strange men.

97
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:34,609
You arranged that fight so you could
pick his pocket? You're a clever guy.

98
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,772
I'm a knight in shining armor.

99
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,112
- Yvonne, the bill.
- 38 francs.

100
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,516
- What are we doing?
- We? It's late.

101
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,180
- Bedtime.
- Your place?

102
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:46,690
- Have you any dough on you?
- Loads. Thirty francs.

103
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:52,663
Thirty francs? Here, kid. For your hotel.
Good night, kid.

104
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:35,129
I say red, darling.

105
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,438
What do you say?

106
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,501
Black.

107
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,034
- Hey, you!
- Where are you going with that suitcase?

108
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:17,047
- You had enough?
- The owner of my hotel has ridiculous principles.

109
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,083
She always wants paying.

110
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,017
The people you owe money to
have always got ridiculous principles.

111
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,021
What happened to the money I gave you?

112
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,216
- Paid my debts. I owe Remi.
- What debts?

113
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,623
Oh, I'm sure you do. I won't ask what for.

114
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,287
He set me up here,
said I could pay him back weekly.

115
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,297
- Does he charge interest?
- What's that?

116
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,299
Never mind.

117
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,733
- All your worldly belongings in there?
- Yes.

118
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,498
- Where will you sleep tonight?
- Somewhere.

119
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:42,563
- You want to come to my place?
- Yes.

120
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,768
Don't worry. You got a home. Get in.

121
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,979
You must have a rich family.

122
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,574
- I can't complain.
- What do you do?

123
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,245
- Ministry of Agriculture.
- What?

124
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,723
Protection of the horse of France.

125
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,759
Seriously, I love horses.

126
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:05,023
I'd have sacrificed everything...
my time, my money, my life...

127
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:07,462
- Isn't that right, Paulo?
- Yeah, that's right.

128
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,865
- It brings in money?
- Never.

129
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,666
Well, I've got to check my horses.

130
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:15,933
- Will you be back late?
- Will I be back late, Paulo?

131
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:18,475
- Never before 6:00.
- Oh.

132
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,171
- I thought that...
- What?

133
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:24,181
- What did you think?
- You'd stay.

134
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:28,208
No, no. Why don't you tell Paulo
what you think? Okay?

135
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,223
Hey.

136
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,284
Hey.

137
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,844
Prince of Orange. Number seven.
That's my lucky number.

138
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,908
- How much do you want to put on it?
- Everything I got left.

139
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,183
- 70,000 francs.
- Bob, you're crazy. What if you lose?

140
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,850
I'll have hit rock-bottom.
I'll have to change my ways.

141
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,860
- Place it for me.
- Do it yourself.

142
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:13,659
Me? Place a bet like that? Never.

143
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,827
Prince of Orange. You could do worse.

144
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,838
Oh, you know, I'm missing a passport.

145
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:24,397
- And the girl that went with it.
- She's just a kid, Remi.

146
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:27,206
- Let her have a life.
- I was investing in her future.

147
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,372
Girls are unreliable.
Horses, now, there's an investment.

148
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,281
- Oh, you're going to give me a tip?
- Prince of Orange. 8-1.

149
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,286
I'd stake my life on it,
and let's call it quits.

150
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,618
I'm not a betting man, Bob.

151
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,420
- But if I was, you know something?
- Try it. It's a blast.

152
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,189
I have to say you owe me one!

153
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,268
Think it'll make the race?

154
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:57,369
Why does he have so much ice cream?

155
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,967
That's all he can eat sometimes.

156
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,775
- Ah, heroin.
- His lady.

157
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,416
I thought luck was his lady.

158
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:09,544
Ah, when one runs out
he turns to the other.

159
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:12,283
- Why?
- Why?

160
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,348
Who knows?

161
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,466
Why do I want to kiss your neck?

162
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:25,230
What about Bob?

163
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:28,238
What about Bob? He's given us some space.

164
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:33,502
Oh. But I thought...

165
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,103
Are you sorry?

166
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,518
Okay.

167
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,362
- So. Where to, boss?
- Home.

168
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,527
Don't you want to continue
your winning streak?

169
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:55,753
- What happened to home?
- Forget about home. You're going to Monte Carlo.

170
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,419
- Where in Monte Carlo?
- The Casino Riviera.

171
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:03,558
You see, Bob, I figure
you needed a reason for living.

172
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,227
- Now that your luck's bottomed out.
- That it has.

173
00:15:06,302 --> 00:15:08,770
- The Casino Riviera...
- Has a safe.

174
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:11,269
Yeah.

175
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:13,527
80 million in cash deposits in a
safe on a hydraulic lift.

176
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,510
We've been through it already.

177
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:18,411
So has everybody from here to Paris.
It's impossible.

178
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:21,712
- Yeah. But that's not it.
- Besides, I'm just a gambler now.

179
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,048
Oh, since when?

180
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,487
- Since my last six convictions.
- Ah.

181
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,491
Let me start again.

182
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,027
The Casino Riviera has been refurbished.

183
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,189
New owner. Funded by a Japanese bank.

184
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:37,233
- So?
- So they're taking it upmarket.

185
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,133
They want to attract
a new class of customer.

186
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:42,694
- How do they do that?
- Art.

187
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:46,572
- Art?
- Paintings. On the walls.

188
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:49,203
- Remember the '80s, Bob?
- No.

189
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,611
TheJaps had so much cash
they couldn't spend it.

190
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,241
- They bought... Yeah.
- Art.

191
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:57,844
Picasso, Modigliani, Cezanne...
At prices you can't imagine.

192
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:01,880
So, to recoup their investment,
they hang it on the wall of the casino.

193
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,392
- And you want to lift...
- Fuck the safe!

194
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,294
The paintings.
Worth more than ten years of Grand Prix.

195
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,891
- How?
- Oh. Now you're interested.

196
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:31,116
Where's Paulo?

197
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:33,451
- Helping a friend.
- Oh.

198
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:59,371
- Better than wallpaper, hmm?
- No comparison.

199
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,318
- What was that song about Van Gogh?
- "Starry, Starry Night."

200
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:08,357
So where is "Starry, Starry Night"?

201
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:12,724
- Maybe in the Guggenheim. But don't be picky.
- Let's not be picky.

202
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,260
Come over here.

203
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,064
- La chambre Picasso.
- Oh, that's how it is.

204
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,701
Hello, Jacqueline. Huh!

205
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,379
- Cezanne.
- Yeah. There's only one problem.

206
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:40,581
- What's that? I know.
- They're fakes.

207
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:46,159
Good ones. I think another forger.

208
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:49,426
- Modigliani. Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

209
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:53,435
- You want to rob fakes?
- No, not exactly. Come outside.

210
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,700
- The originals are in there.
- Why are they in there?

211
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:03,769
It's a Japanese thing.
Protect your investment.

212
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:05,780
Painting in the vault,
perfect copy on the wall...

213
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:08,373
- And we crack the vault?
- Yes.

214
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:11,113
- Yeah.
- And you know the beautiful thing?

215
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,088
- What's the beautiful thing?
- They can't disclose the robbery...

216
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,091
because if they did, the joint closes.

217
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,218
Who'd come to see a copy of a Van Gogh?

218
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:22,253
Either somebody just walked over my grave,
or I'm going through withdrawal.

219
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:24,697
- Maybe you're excited.
- Who tipped you off?

220
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,758
A friend of mine.

221
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:33,498
You leaving the best to last?

222
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:37,637
Vladimir. He installed the security system.

223
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,616
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

224
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,125
I'm out of dope, and I'm out of luck,
and I'm tempted.

225
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:53,424
But I want to die in an old folks' home,
not in a jail.

226
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:56,624
- Well, then, forget about it.
- We'll need money, a lot of it.

227
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,929
- How do you plan to get it?
- I take out a loan.

228
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,231
- Pretty good deal.
- Fuck that. The interest...

229
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:04,467
We'll get the money, Bob.
What we need is a plan.

230
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,169
- Don't you have one?
- That's your speciality.

231
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:11,736
- You know what my plan is?
- You've got one already?

232
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:15,682
No more gambling! No more dope!

233
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:19,483
- Till we pull this off. Of course I'm in.
- So, Bob. You're in?

234
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:33,429
- Hey.
- Here's the deal. I'm gonna chain myself to that bed.

235
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,701
I'm gonna need the bucket, the bedpan...

236
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:40,675
- and some ice cream.
- Yes, Bob. I'm sorry, Bob.

237
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:45,806
Oh, Paulo, love means
never having to say you're sorry.

238
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:48,612
You look good for a man of your age.

239
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:50,948
What age is that?

240
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,682
You know, Stone Age?

241
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:57,453
Kinky, as well.

242
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:01,486
I feel a confinement coming on.

243
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:05,728
What do you say when I ask for that key?

244
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:09,101
- No way.
- Thank you.

245
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,911
Oh, Jesus.

246
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,782
- So you told him?
- Why do you think he's sweating it out?

247
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:28,019
- Hi.
- Hey!

248
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,355
I thought you'd been sent to Algiers.

249
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:33,952
That cop put in a word for me.

250
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,761
Thought you were going to blow away.
How kind.

251
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:42,764
- Seen Bob?
- Why do you want Bob?

252
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,399
- I want to thank him.
- I'll tell him. He'll be touched.

253
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,434
Give me the key.

254
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,838
- No.
- Give me the key.

255
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:22,901
I'll do anything you want.

256
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,210
- You would fuck me?
- If that's what you want, then give me the key.

257
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,280
Come and get it, Mr. Stone Age Man.

258
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:37,091
Do you like my tits, Mr. Stone Age Man?

259
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,960
Give me the key! Give me the key.

260
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,473
Nearly there, Bob. Nearly there.

261
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:57,069
- Nearly there.
- Fuck! I can't.

262
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:03,482
Please, please!

263
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:06,453
You know what, Bob?
I think I'm not your type.

264
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,932
Hey, kid.

265
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:23,995
Thank you.

266
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,674
One day at a time, Bob.

267
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,805
- Isn't that what they say?
- Yeah.

268
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:50,632
- Said. You prefer Nice to Algiers, huh?
- No comparison.

269
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,827
If you're playing for time,
kid, you don't have any.

270
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:55,370
- I swear to you I'm not.
- I'm calling Immigration.

271
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,633
- I've got something big!
- How big?

272
00:22:57,707 --> 00:23:00,141
Bob Montagnet is involved.

273
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:03,303
- Are you fucking with me? You know what that means?
- No, just give me time.

274
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:06,041
- It's personal with you. You like Bob!
- No, no, everyone likes Bob!

275
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:08,174
- That's part of the problem!
- I like Bob too!

276
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,981
You are on double-duty 24 hours a day.
You find out what he is going to do...

277
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:14,921
before he has a chance to do it,
because if I have to book him...

278
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:17,459
I'll carry you personally to Algiers...

279
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:20,359
I'll deliver you in cuffs
to whatever fuckin' mullah...

280
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,590
wants to chop you into pieces over there.

281
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:25,429
- Is that clear? Is that clear?
- Yes. Yes!

282
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:47,313
Shh! He's sleeping.

283
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:53,594
- That's good.
- Three and a half days. Out. Out.

284
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:11,656
Why are the French so god-awfully bad
at rock 'n' roll?

285
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,700
- What do you mean?
- I mean, look at it.

286
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:18,535
We give you Elvis Presley,
Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan.

287
00:26:18,606 --> 00:26:20,540
And you give us Johnny Hallyday.

288
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:23,839
- Don't talk to me aboutJohnny Hallyday, okay?
- All right, all right.

289
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:26,277
You know, I'm a gambler, Roger.

290
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:28,815
- Yeah, I know.
- That means I'm good at probabilities.

291
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:31,784
- I was never good at those.
- Well, I have to be.

292
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:34,549
Having driven now for about
one hour and 45 minutes...

293
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:36,613
and having you constantly
in my rearview mirror...

294
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:39,489
I'd say the probability
is that you're following me.

295
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,427
I was keeping an eye on the Russian girl.
I end up following you.

296
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:45,364
Really?

297
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,161
You're gonna need a tow truck.

298
00:26:56,644 --> 00:27:00,444
- It's your fault.
- No, no, no, no, no.

299
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:02,540
My mother was born down there.

300
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:04,949
She was washing her sheets
in the rocks below...

301
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:07,249
when a parachute fell out of the sky.

302
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:11,519
It carried Vincent Montana,
United States Marine Corps, my father.

303
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:14,356
She thought he was an angel,
delivered from heaven.

304
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,362
Oh, this was a sentimental journey.

305
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,593
At our age, Roger,
we have behind us a growing past...

306
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,601
and face a diminishing future.

307
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,229
- We consider our options.
- Oh, yeah. What are they?

308
00:27:24,305 --> 00:27:26,671
Me? I just go on. We have to stay clean.

309
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:30,434
Will you give me a lift back to Nice?

310
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:33,503
- Will you stop following me?
- Uh-uh.

311
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:35,776
Okay.

312
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,946
Philippe? Philippe?

313
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:43,616
Make up a report, will you? "One silver
Peugeot damaged, near the village of, uh...

314
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:45,750
Bas-sur-I'Eau."

315
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:47,760
Get me the file on Bob.

316
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:51,161
- Bob Montagnet?
- Montagnet, Montana.

317
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:54,133
Bob le flambeur. Bob.

318
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,465
What's his passport? American or French?

319
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,528
Hey. Both.

320
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:07,446
He's growing old, huh?

321
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:13,985
- There's gratitude for you.
- He's turned snitch.

322
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:16,990
Of course he has. All part of the plan.

323
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:20,152
- You going to share it with anybody?
- Well, we're being watched.

324
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:23,025
Tried to enter Monaco yesterday.
Had Roger on my tail.

325
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:25,156
- So you lost him?
- No, I didn't get there.

326
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:27,632
Visited my mother's birthplace instead.

327
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:29,636
- Where was she born?
- I forget.

328
00:28:29,704 --> 00:28:32,696
But as I was lookin' at the place,
whatever it's called...

329
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,968
- I had an epiphany.
- What's an epiphany?

330
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:38,341
- We set up two robberies. Just stay with me.
- Huh?

331
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,642
This one takes some time.

332
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:42,842
We do it on the night
before the Grand Prix.

333
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:45,852
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe, but hear me out.

334
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,321
Every thief around here has been waiting
for years to pull that one off.

335
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,154
So I set it up, finally.
I know they're watching me.

336
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,854
They know I'm down on my luck.

337
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:58,092
- Now, you ever heard ofJudas?
- There is a snitch.

338
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:01,692
Oh, yeah. Always is.
One-time friend. New enemy. Old lover.

339
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,294
You're lucky if you find him
in time to shut him up.

340
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:08,001
But this time, man, I don't care.

341
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:11,169
Maybe I even cultivate him.

342
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,017
- You're not with me.
- Not yet.

343
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:21,077
On the night before the Grand Prix,
I'm in the casino with you and Paulo.

344
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:24,716
We pose as gamblers.
We get an inside contact there.

345
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:28,728
We get the make of the safe, the setup,
as complete as it can be.

346
00:29:28,796 --> 00:29:34,257
But Roger has every cop, every piece of security
in the place watching me.

347
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:38,396
So what do I do? What would you do?

348
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:40,440
- I'd call it off.
- Exactly.

349
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,705
I'd call it off.
But at 5:00 in the morning.

350
00:29:43,778 --> 00:29:47,839
In the meanwhile, we have a crew in the villa
where the real heist takes place.

351
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:53,876
And they've had six, maybe seven
uninterrupted hours to secure those paintings.

352
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:56,889
- Okay.
- It's like those paintings.

353
00:29:56,957 --> 00:30:00,449
- We've got a real heist, and a fake.
- Ah-ha.

354
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,894
With the inner complication
that we want to be betrayed.

355
00:30:02,963 --> 00:30:04,931
Now, let's face it. We generally are.

356
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,559
There's always someone turning snitch.

357
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:11,765
This time we welcome the rat, and I let Roger
stay glued to my ass like a bad hemorrhoid...

358
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,103
I can't get rid of.

359
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:17,906
- Are we having fun yet?
- We will be, if it works.

360
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:20,276
Yeah, if it works.
We better talk to your Vladimir.

361
00:30:22,683 --> 00:30:25,880
- Has he a record, this Vladimir?
- Maybe Moscow.

362
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:29,650
- Why'd he come to you?
- I think it was, uh, pride.

363
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:32,852
- Pride?
- Yeah. You'll see.

364
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,611
Stay back and imagine an invisible square.

365
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,255
I said, stay back and imagine...

366
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:09,592
an invisible, motherfucking square.

367
00:31:17,872 --> 00:31:20,363
So? What do you guys think?

368
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,409
Well, it's impressive, Vlad. Really.

369
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:26,742
You've got to imagine, 30 meters high,
Madison Square Garden.

370
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:29,112
R.E.M. Are ready to bite.

371
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:32,175
We meant your security system, Vlad.

372
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:36,690
Oh. You're the heist guys.

373
00:31:36,757 --> 00:31:38,691
Yeah. We're not the rock 'n' roll guys.

374
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,853
Villa St. Pierre.
Quite complicated, like this.

375
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:45,262
You know how I was going
to call this? "Purple Haze."

376
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:48,495
Yeah, good choice, Vlad. Get back
to the security system. How does it work?

377
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:51,333
The way everything works. Mathematics.

378
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:06,882
180 I-points in vertical.
The horizontal the same.

379
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:09,218
That means, the points of contact equal.

380
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,353
- 180 squared, that's 32,400.
- Very good. But listen.

381
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:17,420
The horizontals and the verticals
move against each other.

382
00:32:17,498 --> 00:32:20,399
So, in effect, I've covered infinity.

383
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:25,234
If anything moves in there, anything that has
body heat more than rigor mortis...

384
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,907
- What if the power fails?
- Half second delay, the generator kicks in.

385
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:37,280
Have you ever tried
to heist in half second?

386
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:40,582
- If the computer fails?
- It cannot.

387
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:45,114
There is another hard drive connected,
has enough gigabytes to run a cruise missile.

388
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:47,490
- You know cruise missiles?
- Yeah.

389
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:50,257
- So it's impregnable?
- Yeah.

390
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:53,664
- Hi. I'm Vlad.
- Hi. I'm Bob.

391
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,759
- This is Paul.
- Hi, Paul. - Hi.

392
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:58,600
- So, why'd you contact us, Vlad?
- Between you and me?

393
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:02,301
- Yeah.
- I got my family back in Vladivostok begging me to get them out.

394
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:05,504
So I got a thinking: The only guy
who could crack impregnable system...

395
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,513
- is the guy who installed it.
- You.

396
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:11,415
Me. The only way Vlad will crack Vlad system
is with a Vlad system.

397
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:14,579
- Still with me?
- Almost.

398
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:18,955
Villa St. Pierre.
I build it here in front of you.

399
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:22,154
Same dimensions, to the centimeter.

400
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:26,256
I match the movement of the sensors
in my set after those in the villa.

401
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,996
I get into the system so they read what's here,
not what's there.

402
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,095
- Oh.
- Then there is a problem of sound.

403
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:37,075
- The sound?
- You heist guys make a noise, no?

404
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:42,808
Wire mesh built into the walls,
floor and the ceiling.

405
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:46,080
Detects noisy, hammering heist guys.

406
00:33:46,153 --> 00:33:48,417
The same thing, I build it here.

407
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:51,322
The exact dimension.
The alarm rings here...

408
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:54,225
- but noisy heist guys hammering there.
- Can you do all this?

409
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:57,526
- I live in hope. Tell you next week.
- Oh.

410
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:01,200
How do you plug in to their system?

411
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:04,635
Their system needs upgrading
every six months.

412
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:08,607
And my next visit is due
Tuesday, next week.

413
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:12,077
I could leave there a beetle.

414
00:34:12,146 --> 00:34:15,707
- Beetle?
- Sorry. It's the wrong word. A "bug."

415
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:18,343
A miniature fifth column.

416
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,019
Takes instructions from you.

417
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:28,521
- And, uh, I need a equal partnership.
- Oh.

418
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:31,530
A "favored nation."

419
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,759
- It's a deal.
- Deal?

420
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,200
Yeah.

421
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:41,002
So. How do we pay for this?

422
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:43,270
The son was sold to a devil.

423
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,147
Do you know what Einstein said
about roulette, Anne?

424
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:58,248
- What?
- It can only be beaten by a gambler...

425
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:02,352
with infinite capital, playing in a game
without limits for eternity.

426
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:06,388
- So why play?
- Einstein didn't believe in luck.

427
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:11,632
- Black.
- You're gonna tell me I have to go now, right?

428
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:13,866
You can't stay here, Anne.

429
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:16,307
Paulo's waiting for you in the car.

430
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,642
What if I said no?

431
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:26,117
Well, I think Paulo
would be very disappointed.

432
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:32,551
No.

433
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:40,359
Oh, no, no, no, no. My, my.

434
00:35:44,171 --> 00:35:46,605
Mm. Bob. Oh!

435
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:01,649
He thinks the sun shines out of your eyes.

436
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:05,021
No, he thinks it shines out of yours.

437
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,117
And the moon. He imitates you, Bob.

438
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:09,458
He's a good kid.

439
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:13,132
Some girls prefer the real thing.

440
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,260
Oh, ho, you think I'm the real thing?

441
00:36:16,336 --> 00:36:18,566
You said I'd always have a home.

442
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,406
If you choose.
He's giving you a job, isn't he?

443
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:27,311
- So he says.
- So, what else does he say?

444
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:32,479
"I love you." All the time.

445
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:37,918
Only one solution. Say it back.

446
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:40,789
I can't. I never could.

447
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:52,738
- So, my place?
- You promise I won't regret it?

448
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,933
I promise.

449
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:18,090
- Yeah, I'd heard the legend.
- Pamplona. Pablo bet on the matador...

450
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:21,622
- I bet on the bull.
- And the matador got how many stitches?

451
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:26,331
- Twenty-six.
- I never believed until now.

452
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:31,002
Amazing. I mean, the place
to sell this is New York.

453
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:33,011
No, no, no, no. Can't go back there.

454
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,845
I'd heard that too. So, what do you want?

455
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:41,285
- An advance against the salary. You take your commission.
- Forty percent.

456
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:44,517
Do we argue that now?

457
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,854
No. Not now.

458
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:48,894
So, when can I see it?

459
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:53,788
Milk. Straight up.

460
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:59,136
- You going through your second childhood, Bob?
- Twelve steps.

461
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:01,139
I think I'm on two and a half. Chin-chin.

462
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,508
- I spoke to Petit Louis.
- So?

463
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,775
- Is he interested?
- Interested enough to talk to you.

464
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:12,750
Good. We'll need Fernandez, Luigi and Bill.

465
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:15,049
- You've turned down Philippe?
- Yeah, all the apostles.

466
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:18,420
And here comes one candidate forJudas.

467
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:22,693
So, they let you out, my friend.

468
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:25,128
Yeah. Someone put in a good word for me.

469
00:38:25,198 --> 00:38:28,326
I thought it might be you.
That cop's a friend of yours, no?

470
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:31,461
- Were there any conditions?
- I had to sign up for rehab.

471
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:34,131
- So, you're clean too, huh?
- Yeah, I'm clean.

472
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,809
But I've got a line on some golden brown.

473
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:40,778
Oh. How are you gonna make ends meet...

474
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:43,748
now that you're not filling up
that hole in my arm?

475
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:47,149
- Ciao, Yvonne.
- Let's go. - Ciao.

476
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:57,126
- Is Fernandez around?
- Why you want Fernandez?

477
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:59,858
Ask him, does he still want pesetas
to open that club in Rio?

478
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:03,459
- But it's no good if we can't shoot.
- No boom-boom, Louis.

479
00:39:03,536 --> 00:39:05,470
This won't be the movies.

480
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:08,268
- You mean, I can't even shoot blanks?
- No.

481
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:10,332
- Action.!
- Shh!

482
00:39:19,018 --> 00:39:21,885
Oh, you look like
you kept in shape, Philippe.

483
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:24,684
Yeah. I work out.
But you know the way it is.

484
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:27,658
- Time passes, we all change.
- Uh-huh, do we ever.

485
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:29,661
Yeah, well, some more than others.

486
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:33,221
- I don't know quite how to put this, Bob.
- Tell me anything, Philippe.

487
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:37,326
Okay, it's Philippa now.
But if you still want me, I'm in.

488
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:45,968
- Hey, Luigi.
- Oui, oui?

489
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:50,948
You know what he used to say:
I never borrow, I steal.

490
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:56,785
Well, he was a good thief here.
I can see some Ingres.

491
00:39:56,856 --> 00:39:59,950
Bit of Velazquez in these eyes.

492
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:04,429
And this neck.
Some of those old Etruscan vases they used to...

493
00:40:04,497 --> 00:40:07,694
pick up on the beaches at Pompeii.

494
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,001
If this is hot, Bob, I'm not touching it.

495
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:17,600
It was a bet. On my child's life.

496
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:20,669
If this is hot, your child
won't have a life.

497
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:27,216
I've got too many raps against me already.

498
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,220
There's no signature.

499
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:32,189
A lot of'em aren't signed. Here.

500
00:40:38,264 --> 00:40:41,722
- Pamplona, 1969.
- Mm.

501
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:49,207
- And that's the signature.
- Yeah.

502
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:51,209
I'd say, two to three million dollars...

503
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:54,110
at auction in New York.

504
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,375
- I take my commission.
- Twenty-five.

505
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:00,283
- Are you in a position to bargain?
- Thirty then.

506
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:03,789
- With a 10% advance.
- One and a half million francs.

507
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:08,623
If there's something you're not telling me,
what's my security?

508
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:12,494
There's nothing I'm not telling you.
And you have the painting.

509
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:17,626
Does it come with wrapping?

510
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,570
Hello, Big Ears.

511
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,154
Hello.

512
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:40,682
So, how many of you guys knew
Philippe had turned into Philippa?

513
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,228
- Well, I knew.
- I knew too, Bob. - Yeah?

514
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:45,389
- You mean, you didn't know?
- Nobody tells me anything.

515
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,433
- Enough about me. Are you going to tell us why we're here?
- Yes.

516
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:54,264
- Hello.
- Hi.

517
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,331
Jack Daniels?

518
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:04,180
The fakes are cover for the real.

519
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:09,153
It travels on the grapevine.
The real one stays mum.

520
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,985
- Yeah.
- How do we keep it mum?

521
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:14,686
We all trust in each other in this room.

522
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,887
We've all worked together.

523
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:21,957
Any of you lets a whisper out,
I'll lock him in the bathhouse with Philippa.

524
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:24,298
How do they travel on the grapevine?

525
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,361
Why do you think I asked to meet here?

526
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,709
There is your snitch.

527
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:40,809
See how simple it becomes
when you embrace your own Judas?

528
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:44,084
Oh, my God. You did sell your soul.

529
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,681
- I had to sell something.
- To whom?

530
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:48,693
- Tony Angel.
- Tony Angel?

531
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:51,662
- I hope you got a fair price.
- I got this.

532
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:59,703
Fernandez.

533
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:01,740
Luigi.

534
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:04,173
Petit Louis.

535
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:07,007
- Philippa.
- Hey. Aren't you worried about Philippe?

536
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,741
- Why? Should I be?
- Since he...

537
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:12,283
You know. Became Philippa.

538
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:15,286
When he had his balls cut off,
he lost his balls, so to speak?

539
00:43:15,354 --> 00:43:18,084
That's sex discrimination, Paulo.

540
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:22,253
- But women, they talk more!
- Does Philippa look like a woman to you?

541
00:43:22,328 --> 00:43:25,388
No, he looks like, uh,
Philippe... with melons.

542
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:28,058
I'd trust Philippa with my life.

543
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:31,865
I'll tell you what. Tell her if she talks,
I'll cut off her cojones.

544
00:43:31,937 --> 00:43:34,132
Or did she lose them, too?

545
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:17,440
- What was that about?
- You told me to be nice to the patrons.

546
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:20,076
Now you're jealous. That's sweet.

547
00:44:22,888 --> 00:44:26,984
- Don't wait up for me.
- Now I'm jealous. Where are you going?

548
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:30,654
- I got to meet Bob.
- Always meeting Bob. What is it this time?

549
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:13,162
- I could retire on this.
- So R.E.M. Took the bait?

550
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:16,868
Oh, fuck rock 'n' roll.
You heist guys are easier to deal with.

551
00:45:16,942 --> 00:45:18,876
So, what do the heist guys think?

552
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:22,243
- Oh, it's amazing, Vlad.
- Almost.

553
00:45:22,314 --> 00:45:25,044
A problem if you heist guys get too noisy.

554
00:45:27,453 --> 00:45:29,546
All the system still in place.

555
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:38,587
Over 90 d.B.'s, there is alarm override.

556
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:41,098
So, we mike ourselves.
Carry a decibel comp.

557
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:44,330
- Regrettably, the best Vlad can do.
- How about the cameras?

558
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:46,598
You could have orgy there.
Nobody would notice.

559
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:50,108
- You into orgies, Bob?
- No, not since '72.

560
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:54,112
It's a deliberate mistake.
I got a good computer graphics.

561
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,115
But I'm not Cezanne.
I need photographs from the casino...

562
00:45:57,183 --> 00:46:00,550
- to fill all these frames.
- I need to see that vault.

563
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,417
I have an appointment Tuesday
to upgrade their system.

564
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:08,392
I can't get you in there,
but it doesn't mean you cannot see it.

565
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:24,399
Hey, you!

566
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:29,981
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't. You know that.

567
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:33,416
What kind of girl is it
cannot say three words?

568
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:38,218
Very tired girl.
From a deeply dysfunctional family.

569
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:43,284
- I say it to you!
- Nobody asked you to.

570
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:46,297
What do I have to do to get you to say it?

571
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:48,799
Huh?

572
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:51,530
Get me the moon.

573
00:46:57,877 --> 00:46:59,868
I'll do better.

574
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:10,149
Suppose I told you I was going to rob the Casino
Riviera on the night before the Grand Prix?

575
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:13,825
And all for you.

576
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:17,385
- How much in the safe?
- Is that all you can say?

577
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:19,863
That's all.

578
00:47:21,634 --> 00:47:24,194
Eighty million francs.

579
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:28,696
So say it.

580
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:33,134
Eighty million francs.

581
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,508
- It's Roger.
- Are you sure?

582
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,635
- Certain.
- Aw, shit!

583
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:09,738
- Change of plan?
- Yeah. You gotta take the train.

584
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:13,410
- And you take the camera.
- You mean this lighter is a camera?

585
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:17,046
It's a Minox. Do you think
I was gonna go up there with a Nikon?

586
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:20,956
Take pictures of paintings.
Then play slot machines till I get there.

587
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,153
- How does it work?
- Open it up...

588
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,992
look through the viewfinder,
give yourself a light.

589
00:48:26,065 --> 00:48:27,999
- You like smoking?
- Not that much.

590
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:32,197
There's 24 paintings.
That's 24 Marlboro Lights, I hope.

591
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:34,330
I was trying to give it up.

592
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:50,803
Roger, I've given up my studies
on the probability theory.

593
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:54,942
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, all that computation addles the brain.

594
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,385
All I can say now is, "What a coincidence!"

595
00:49:57,454 --> 00:50:00,184
No. No coincidence. I was following you.

596
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:02,919
- Hot damn, wrong again.
- You found religion?

597
00:50:02,993 --> 00:50:06,258
I'm paying my respects... to my mother.

598
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,299
- Do you remember that village where she was born?
- Yeah. Bas-sur-I'Eau.

599
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:12,824
- Yeah. That G.I. That came out of the sky?
- What is your father?

600
00:50:12,903 --> 00:50:15,770
Yeah. Well, they moved here,
to the old town.

601
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,433
He became a junkie.
And when he up and left...

602
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:22,843
she became one of those ladies in black you see
over there lighting candles.

603
00:50:22,913 --> 00:50:25,245
Praying for her husband's return.

604
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:28,444
- Were her prayers answered?
- Well, the way all prayers are answered.

605
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,453
Not in the way she wanted.

606
00:50:30,521 --> 00:50:32,751
He turned up again when I was seven,
clean as a whistle...

607
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:36,816
with a new wife named Dora...
took me to a new life in America.

608
00:50:36,894 --> 00:50:40,261
And, by the time
I made it back here, well...

609
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:42,390
- She wasn't lighting candles anymore.
- Yeah.

610
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,866
You know, that's the third
version you've told me.

611
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:49,133
Well, that's the truth.

612
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:52,073
- So is it true what they're saying?
- What are they saying?

613
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:55,134
Well, they say you're back in business.

614
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,613
- No?
- The only business I'm in, Roger...

615
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:02,481
is the business of recovery.

616
00:51:02,553 --> 00:51:05,044
Three weeks. I'm clean.

617
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:26,708
Our daily bread,
forgive us our trespasses...

618
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:36,318
Have you heard the story
of the Good Thief, Roger?

619
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:38,651
- No. I'm not religious.
- No. Neither am I.

620
00:51:38,722 --> 00:51:41,555
But when my mother told it,
I guess it stuck.

621
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:45,117
The Good Thief...
besideJesus on the cross...

622
00:51:45,195 --> 00:51:48,687
and Jesus said to him,
if I remember this right...

623
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:51,826
"Tonight you will be with me in paradise."

624
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:55,394
And the thought that there was a place
in heaven for a thief always made me cry.

625
00:51:55,472 --> 00:51:57,406
You want to make me cry now?

626
00:51:57,474 --> 00:52:01,171
You gotta watch this cynicism, Roger.
It's too easy in that job of yours.

627
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:05,443
- I'll work on my attitude.
- You should. You should.

628
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:17,583
Bob. You saved my life,
but if you try something...

629
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:20,755
- Try what?
- Do I have to spell it out? I'll put you down for life.

630
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:23,197
- You're a cop. That's what you do.
- What are you?

631
00:52:23,267 --> 00:52:26,532
I was good at thieving once, Roger,
and I may not be the Good Thief yet...

632
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:29,299
but I am trying... believe me, I am trying.

633
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:31,307
Now if you excuse me.

634
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,309
I have to pay my respects.

635
00:52:33,377 --> 00:52:36,073
She was a good woman. My mother.

636
00:53:15,252 --> 00:53:18,380
What do you know? It's the Candy Man.

637
00:53:18,455 --> 00:53:20,821
- Is that my new name?
- Yeah.

638
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:23,257
Got a kiss for me this fine evening?

639
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,386
Yeah, sure.

640
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:34,861
Your boyfriend Paulo... what's he up to?

641
00:53:34,938 --> 00:53:38,339
- Works with Bob.
- On what?

642
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:41,400
- Doesn't tell me.
- What's he working on, baby?

643
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:44,879
That surprise.

644
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:50,276
- On a safe.
- What safe?

645
00:53:50,354 --> 00:53:52,822
Give me first.

646
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:04,667
A safe with 80 million.

647
00:54:06,303 --> 00:54:09,568
That's all I know.

648
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:30,449
Got a light?

649
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:36,925
That's it. I'm giving up smoking.

650
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,697
- Do you know nicotine's more addictive than heroin?
- Really?

651
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:42,705
Ask any junkie.

652
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:44,764
- Are you done?
- Mm-hmm.

653
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,278
- Anyone clock you?
- I don't think so.

654
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:50,973
Guy with short hair with the ear piece.
Do you notice him?

655
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:54,244
- Huh? Well, he noticed me.
- Yeah.

656
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:56,309
Come on.

657
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:16,228
- You want to see the vault?
- Yeah.

658
00:55:16,306 --> 00:55:18,672
I do my regular check on their system.

659
00:55:18,742 --> 00:55:21,609
I plant my beetle.
Meanwhile, you enjoy the view.

660
00:55:21,678 --> 00:55:24,511
- From where?
- From the car behind.

661
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:29,644
A reasonable picture, up to 100 meters.
Then it gets emotional.

662
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,450
- Emotional?
- Kind of fuzzy.

663
00:55:32,522 --> 00:55:35,286
Oh, emotional.

664
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:20,734
- He has some kind of fancy system.
- Yes.

665
00:56:20,804 --> 00:56:22,738
- And there is nothing in that vault?
- Oh.

666
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:25,297
I got a fine assist,
I guess we'll soon find out.

667
00:56:29,246 --> 00:56:31,237
Bon soir, monsieur.

668
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:34,350
Plans of the villa.

669
00:56:34,418 --> 00:56:37,080
- Where did you get them?
- Architectural Heritage Society. Very helpful.

670
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:39,088
Security room, basement.

671
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:54,170
Don't you guys know me by now?

672
00:56:54,237 --> 00:56:57,001
- Procedure is procedure.
- Oh!

673
00:56:57,074 --> 00:57:01,704
Procedure is procedure.
Sounds like a techno band from Dusseldorf.

674
00:57:44,521 --> 00:57:47,581
- Oh.
- Wow!

675
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:49,750
No fantasist he.

676
00:58:14,518 --> 00:58:16,452
Good.

677
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:48,942
Could you...

678
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,895
- Thank you.
- Guess what that is.

679
00:59:00,964 --> 00:59:03,364
- What?
- The old Napoleonic sewers.

680
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:05,799
They run downhill towards the sea.

681
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:09,202
That's our way in.
Turn that off. We can watch it later.

682
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:32,553
Come on.
Do you think I'm blind or something...

683
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:35,097
that I haven't noticed what you're up to?

684
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:38,464
- Yvonne...
- Men coming here to see you, phone calls, everything.

685
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:41,026
You're crazy.

686
00:59:41,104 --> 00:59:45,097
Bob, I haven't forgotten
that I opened this bar...

687
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:47,109
with money you lent me.

688
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:53,116
- So, if you need money now...
- You're mad, Yvonne. What put that idea in your head?

689
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:58,177
If you get yourself arrested,
you wouldn't survive, you bastard.

690
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:03,056
Would you come and visit me inside,
bring me whiskey in a flask?

691
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:07,392
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- Do you know him?

692
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:12,958
No. Never saw him before.

693
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:16,938
Why do I imagine I have?

694
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:19,271
- Ciao.
- Take care.

695
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:24,270
Turn around. Follow me.

696
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:29,408
- What's up?
- Behind me. You remember him?

697
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:40,285
Philippa, hop in that doorway
and find out what his beef is.

698
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:50,462
- What the hell?
- Oh.

699
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,804
You think he whacked Philippa?

700
01:00:52,876 --> 01:00:55,845
Nobody whacks Philippa.
You're twins, right?

701
01:00:55,912 --> 01:00:59,473
We're onto you. Whoa, whoa.

702
01:00:59,549 --> 01:01:02,074
What the fuck do you think you're doin'?

703
01:01:02,152 --> 01:01:05,747
- Get off!
- Philippa! Stop! Stop! Stop!

704
01:01:05,822 --> 01:01:09,588
- My arms are getting tired.
- Phil, be a bit more gentlemanly.

705
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:13,229
This is Albert. That's Bertram
you're abusing. They're twins.

706
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,162
This is Albert. That's Bertram
you're abusing. They're twins.

707
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:16,165
Now, say you're sorry.

708
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:18,758
- Sorry, Albert.
- The name's Bert.

709
01:01:18,835 --> 01:01:21,827
Let's go through it again.
This time pretend I'm slow.

710
01:01:21,905 --> 01:01:25,636
- Slow?
- Yeah, it means stupid, um, kind of.

711
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:29,008
- It's simplicity itself.
- He's in charge of the deposits to the safe.

712
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:31,013
They change the combinations weekly.

713
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:34,346
- I get the numbers. I make the deposits.
- He gives me the combinations.

714
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:38,353
The night before the Grand Prix, while he's
in the manager's office, I'm on the floor.

715
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:43,017
- The staff take me for him.
- He has access to the safe, and my alibi is solid as a rock.

716
01:01:43,093 --> 01:01:46,654
I see. You've put a lot
of thinking into this.

717
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:48,664
Two heads are better than one.

718
01:01:48,732 --> 01:01:53,192
- So, what was your plan?
- Nothing like yours.

719
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:56,728
- Infantile in comparison.
- We need help to move that kind of money.

720
01:01:56,806 --> 01:01:59,934
So, if you want in...

721
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:03,707
- No one's ever seen you together.
- No one in Monte Carlo.

722
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:11,083
- Give us a day or two to think about it. Right, Paulo?
- Or three.

723
01:02:11,154 --> 01:02:13,679
You go out the back. You go out the front.

724
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,665
- Crazy, boss, huh?
- Totally.

725
01:02:29,739 --> 01:02:33,800
But, you know, we want them
to think we want that safe.

726
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:36,641
Twins. You see Roger's following that?

727
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:39,648
How's he gonna know
they're twins? Tell you what.

728
01:02:39,716 --> 01:02:42,685
Call him in a day or two.
Go through their plan again.

729
01:02:42,752 --> 01:02:45,846
- It has the benefit of originality.
- We've got that meeting.

730
01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:49,653
Yeah. You go out the back.
I'll go out the front. Try to lose Roger.

731
01:02:49,726 --> 01:02:51,717
Start without me if you have to.

732
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:12,371
Would you drive me, Roger? I have a meeting.
I'm attending Narcotics Anonymous.

733
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:14,383
That was your support group up there?

734
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:18,785
Yeah.

735
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:24,757
You're welcome to join me. You should
support me in my battle against my addictions.

736
01:03:24,828 --> 01:03:26,762
Your addictions being...

737
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:29,458
Gambling and narcotics.

738
01:03:29,532 --> 01:03:34,401
Okay, guys, imagine this is a vault.
All the alarms will be...

739
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:36,735
coming in from here...

740
01:03:36,806 --> 01:03:38,740
And reinforced steel floor...

741
01:03:38,808 --> 01:03:42,904
- You know, every addict, Roger, has an enabler.
- Nobody tells me anything.

742
01:03:42,979 --> 01:03:46,813
The one who, through no fault of their own,
maintains the addict in their habit.

743
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:48,874
Often needs the addict in their habit.

744
01:03:48,952 --> 01:03:52,319
- Let me guess. Your enabler is...
- Is you.

745
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,483
We're codependents, Roger.
We have been for years.

746
01:03:55,558 --> 01:03:57,617
I mean, look at you, now.

747
01:03:57,694 --> 01:04:01,994
You're chasin' me, because you imagine
that I'm chasin' a big score.

748
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:05,296
And maybe the cure starts with you.

749
01:04:05,368 --> 01:04:09,395
- The cure?
- Yeah, because deep down you want me to try that big one...

750
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:11,463
if only to see how I'd do it.

751
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,772
There's nothing I can do
that'll convince you that I'm clean.

752
01:04:14,844 --> 01:04:16,812
It's unhealthy, Roger.

753
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,849
- It means we're both hooked.
- Running through a tunnel...

754
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,850
between the ceiling and the floor...

755
01:04:21,918 --> 01:04:27,220
Bill packs these mikes... Make sure
you keep that needle below 90. Right, Vlad?

756
01:04:32,162 --> 01:04:35,290
You wanna come up?
We can explore these issues further.

757
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:38,027
- I haven't hit rock bottom yet.
- You will.

758
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:41,161
- Are you sure?
- The cure starts now. Say it.

759
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:45,071
- Say what?
- "My name is Roger. I'm an addict in recovery."

760
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:49,976
- No, no. You say it.
- My name is Bob, and I'm an addict in recovery.

761
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:54,676
And today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

762
01:05:02,492 --> 01:05:05,154
My name is Michelle, and I am an addict.

763
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:07,162
Hello, Michelle.

764
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,960
My name is Anne, and I am an addict.

765
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:12,092
- Hello, Anne.
- My name is Case.

766
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:14,102
- I am an addict.
- Hello, Case.

767
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,037
- My name is Bob, and I'm an addict.
- Hello, Bob.

768
01:05:17,106 --> 01:05:19,097
My name is Francois, and I'm an addict.

769
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:23,111
Hello, Francois.

770
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:27,013
Paulo replaces the grill
andjoins Bob and me in the casino.

771
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:30,280
We keep them busy there. And... no smoking.

772
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:36,515
Okay, guys: Mikes, needle, gas main,
grill and casino, eh?

773
01:05:36,593 --> 01:05:39,687
- And that's how it works in theory.
- Yeah, in theory.

774
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:42,492
We rehearse this on Friday.
Did you explain everything?

775
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,499
Yeah, yeah.

776
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:48,128
Well, we're gonna go in there at night,
all right? Everybody understand that?

777
01:06:34,918 --> 01:06:38,479
So, Remi, have I gone up in the world,
or come down?

778
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:40,819
From my perspective,
you're kind of standing still.

779
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:43,290
You can't move standing still?

780
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:46,157
I think you should
value yourself more highly.

781
01:06:46,229 --> 01:06:48,163
Think he's right, Said?

782
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:52,600
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

783
01:06:52,669 --> 01:06:56,435
- On what you're selling.
- Damaged goods. That's me.

784
01:06:56,506 --> 01:06:59,031
Would you prefer
to discuss this in private?

785
01:06:59,108 --> 01:07:02,874
Private? I like private.

786
01:07:08,785 --> 01:07:11,777
Come on, guys. Come on.

787
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:33,501
Location, the safe, the 80 million francs.

788
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:38,843
- And why should I tell you?
- Because I'll give you pleasant dreams.

789
01:07:38,915 --> 01:07:41,406
- Hmm.
- Look at this.

790
01:08:00,637 --> 01:08:04,664
Paulo. Philippa.

791
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:06,675
- Gas faucet.
- Right.

792
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:10,702
Twist it left till it stops.

793
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:13,715
Okay, boss.

794
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:17,545
Aaah!

795
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,726
Hey...

796
01:08:25,795 --> 01:08:28,559
They're gonna rob...

797
01:08:28,631 --> 01:08:31,964
Bank of America, fourth ofJuly.

798
01:08:32,035 --> 01:08:35,766
- Don't make fun of me, you bitch!
- Learn maturity from the dogs in the street?

799
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:38,432
I know it's the casino
where they are, okay?

800
01:08:38,508 --> 01:08:41,477
The night before the Grand Prix
in Monte Carlo. Now, fuck off.

801
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:43,535
- Chill it.!
- What?

802
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:48,442
Anne? How are you?

803
01:08:48,518 --> 01:08:49,746
- Okay.
- How are you?

804
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:51,047
- Good.
- You okay?

805
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,464
- Here.
- Are you certain?

806
01:09:02,532 --> 01:09:05,660
- Yeah.
- It's my bag. I think it's lonely.

807
01:09:05,735 --> 01:09:08,499
I miss you too.

808
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:11,233
So, Vlad, that alarms aren't mobilized?

809
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:13,798
You still don't believe me?

810
01:09:13,876 --> 01:09:17,812
- What time is it, Raoul?
- Uh, 2:45.

811
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,577
2:45. Okay. Here goes.

812
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:25,519
- A lovely kid like you
shouldn't be in a nightclub, you know?

813
01:09:25,588 --> 01:09:27,522
You want me on the streets?

814
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:30,559
Anne, you don't look 14. We both know that.

815
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:34,585
- For you?
- For both of us.

816
01:09:34,664 --> 01:09:39,101
I must be made of gold, then.
Everybody wants a piece of me.

817
01:09:39,168 --> 01:09:42,660
Okay, let's go.
You should get some fresh air. Come on.

818
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,706
Yeah.

819
01:10:25,314 --> 01:10:27,646
All right. Two feet of brick.

820
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:29,947
Keep the sound at sixty d.B. Should take?

821
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:32,988
- No. Two more is max.
- All right. Let's get the torch ready.

822
01:10:38,761 --> 01:10:40,162
Maybe I should melt myself down...

823
01:10:40,163 --> 01:10:41,960
Maybe I should melt myself down...

824
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:45,489
and give a piece of me
to everyone who wants a piece of me.

825
01:10:45,568 --> 01:10:47,502
Who wants a piece of you?

826
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:52,139
- Paulo for one.
- Oh. And what does he want?

827
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,199
- He wants to buy me the moon.
- Oh?

828
01:10:54,277 --> 01:10:56,939
- The moon.
- Mmm.

829
01:10:57,013 --> 01:10:59,208
Moon's very expensive, you know.

830
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:02,274
And how would he pay for it?

831
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:06,845
- The heist.
- Oh, yes. Of course. The heist. Who else?

832
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:09,255
Said.

833
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:13,989
- He wants to know what I know about the heist.
- Oh. What do you know?

834
01:11:14,063 --> 01:11:16,759
Mm, well, what I know I didn't tell him.

835
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:19,893
That's my clever girl.

836
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:22,961
And Monsieur Bob, he doesn't want money.

837
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,839
He wants what money can't buy.

838
01:11:26,909 --> 01:11:29,673
What can't money buy?

839
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:32,236
Beauty.

840
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:35,148
- You are being mysterious now.
- Hmm.

841
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:38,119
Isn't beauty always mysterious?

842
01:11:38,187 --> 01:11:41,452
- Like you.
- Hmm.

843
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:50,559
- I'm tired, Remi. Will you take me home?
- Of course. Of course.

844
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:54,365
- Can you keep a secret, Paulo?
- Depends.

845
01:11:54,437 --> 01:11:57,338
After the operation,
everything was the same.

846
01:11:57,406 --> 01:11:59,636
- Everything?
- Ja. I bench press 400 pounds...

847
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:03,736
- I'm still the same bad motherfucker, except for...
- Except for what?

848
01:12:03,813 --> 01:12:06,748
- Spiders. Can't take spiders.
- Spiders?

849
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:10,513
- And there's spiders round that faucet, Paulo.
- Uh-huh.

850
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:13,953
Can you do the faucet, Paulo?

851
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:17,515
- Yeah. I'll... I'll do the faucet for you.
- And keep it between us, Paulo.

852
01:12:17,593 --> 01:12:21,097
I mean, I don't want no laughing.
I got a reputation, you know?

853
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:27,592
Here you go.

854
01:13:32,935 --> 01:13:35,597
Paulo.

855
01:13:35,671 --> 01:13:39,505
- What the fuck is...
- I helped your girlfriend home.

856
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:43,477
- You?
- Yes. Someone has to look out for her, you know?

857
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:48,415
She was in a bad way,
out of her head, telling stories.

858
01:13:48,484 --> 01:13:50,418
- Cool. Cool. Cool.
- What stories?

859
01:13:50,486 --> 01:13:52,613
- Cool.
- I said, what fucking stories?

860
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:55,282
Something about the safe. 80 million...

861
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:58,760
The quai in Monte Carlo.

862
01:13:58,827 --> 01:14:00,920
Who'd she tell?

863
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:02,930
Said.

864
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:06,567
They say they have a deal.

865
01:14:06,635 --> 01:14:09,126
When he gets her high,
then he fucks her, then...

866
01:14:09,205 --> 01:14:11,435
then she tells him what the real story is.

867
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:13,600
It's not true, you lying pig!

868
01:14:13,676 --> 01:14:17,612
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I swear. I swear... on my tribe's life.

869
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,614
Fuck!

870
01:15:27,216 --> 01:15:29,616
You'll get me shot, cop,
asking to tail like that.

871
01:15:29,685 --> 01:15:32,017
- Bob never killed anyone.
- Always a first time.

872
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:38,352
You can always take your chances
in Algiers.

873
01:15:38,427 --> 01:15:41,555
Tell me.

874
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:46,363
The Casino Riviera in Monaco.
There's a safe with 80 million francs.

875
01:15:46,435 --> 01:15:49,302
- I don't believe you.
- Tomorrow night, before the Grand Prix.

876
01:15:56,145 --> 01:16:00,138
Said! Said! Said! Said!

877
01:16:07,423 --> 01:16:10,915
If you want witnesses, Captain,
I saw the whole thing. It was Paulo Turco.

878
01:16:10,993 --> 01:16:13,689
Tell me something useful, would you?

879
01:16:13,762 --> 01:16:16,526
He was afraid they blow the whistle
about the Casino Riviera.

880
01:16:16,598 --> 01:16:19,089
- I never thought Bob would be that stupid.
- He's not.

881
01:16:19,168 --> 01:16:21,398
- He just wants you to think he is.
- Hello?

882
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:24,439
- I have this terrible feeling you're going to tell me something.
- Yes.

883
01:16:24,506 --> 01:16:28,909
- It's not the money. The paintings on the walls!
- What paintings?

884
01:16:28,977 --> 01:16:31,946
You should call the casino.

885
01:16:32,014 --> 01:16:35,381
Bob? What did I do, Bob? Huh? Huh?

886
01:16:35,451 --> 01:16:37,749
I don't know, honey. What did you do?

887
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:40,288
Careful. Now, pick your feet up.

888
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:46,957
Fuck.! I fuck it up bad, man.

889
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:49,088
- I'm sorry, I lost it.
- What?

890
01:16:49,164 --> 01:16:53,464
Your Romeo here just shot your dealer,
and we have to know what you told him.

891
01:16:53,535 --> 01:16:56,026
- Nothing.
- Don't lie, you drunken bitch.!

892
01:16:56,105 --> 01:16:58,073
You told him and you fucked him.

893
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,769
You're a tough guy, Paulo? You shoot a
strung-out kid. What does that make you, huh?

894
01:17:01,844 --> 01:17:06,213
A mean, motherfucking,
gang-banging... bastard!

895
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:10,240
Get out of the car, Anne.

896
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:14,915
Pathetic, fucking cliche!

897
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,982
You're gonna keep driving
till you reach San Remo, tough guy.

898
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,961
- You know where San Remo is?
- It's in Italy?

899
01:17:21,029 --> 01:17:24,055
You're facing a murder rap, Paulo.
That's quite a surprise.

900
01:17:24,133 --> 01:17:26,431
I don't want any more surprises.

901
01:17:26,502 --> 01:17:30,404
- I'll make it up to you, Bob.
- Okay. Make it up to me in Italy.

902
01:17:40,783 --> 01:17:45,049
And I'll be grateful, Anne,
if you told me what you said.

903
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,783
I swear, I told him nothing,
but Remi said...

904
01:17:48,857 --> 01:17:51,325
Wait. So Remi said something?

905
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:53,327
Mmm.

906
01:17:53,395 --> 01:17:56,330
I told him what Paulo told me...

907
01:17:56,398 --> 01:17:59,765
about the Monte Carlo,
the night before Grand Prix.

908
01:17:59,835 --> 01:18:01,769
Paulo told you that?

909
01:18:01,837 --> 01:18:05,967
Yeah. He said he'd buy me the moon
when you robbed the casino.

910
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:09,169
When we robbed what from the casino?

911
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:12,077
The safe with 80 million.

912
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:16,447
- And that's all Remi told him?
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:18:16,518 --> 01:18:19,715
He said, "I'll straighten you out."

914
01:18:19,788 --> 01:18:24,191
Okay. It's okay, kid. It's okay.

915
01:18:24,259 --> 01:18:26,250
It's okay.

916
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:53,010
Anne... No!

917
01:18:55,724 --> 01:18:58,124
Hey, you, fake.! Where's my money?

918
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:00,127
- So, you knew Picasso?
- Met him once.

919
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:03,426
Pamplona, wasn't it?
He bet on the matador. You bet on the bull.

920
01:19:03,499 --> 01:19:06,195
- The matador got how many stitches?
- Twenty-six.

921
01:19:06,268 --> 01:19:10,568
Well, it can't have been Pablo. It must have
been Paddy Picasso, his distant Irish cousin...

922
01:19:10,639 --> 01:19:13,472
because I had this canvas
valued in New York.

923
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:17,911
- It's not worth the fucking freight charge. It's a fake!
- It's a good fake, though.

924
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:21,541
Isn't that a contradiction in terms:
"A good fake, a happy homosexual"?

925
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:24,586
It was painted by Paul Keating,
one of the truly great fake...

926
01:19:24,653 --> 01:19:27,383
- Where did you meet him?
- At a betting shop in Croydon.

927
01:19:27,456 --> 01:19:31,085
- I gave him a tip on...
- Kazinski here is a really great artist. Show him.

928
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:33,753
No.! Not her. Not yet. The picture.

929
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,201
So, if I don't...

930
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,104
Get my... money back by Monday...

931
01:19:45,173 --> 01:19:48,074
what I do to both your faces
will definitely be cubist.

932
01:19:48,143 --> 01:19:51,977
Call it the new aesthetic.
What do you call it, child?

933
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:55,813
- The new aesthetic.
- Without an anesthetic. When did I say?

934
01:19:55,884 --> 01:19:59,547
- Monday.
- Monday. Come on, Kaz.

935
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:08,660
It's all right. It's okay.

936
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:12,393
- Have you ever tried gambling, Anne?
- No.

937
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:14,401
And I never knew Picasso.

938
01:20:14,469 --> 01:20:18,906
Well, the thing about Pablo was,
no one ever really knew him.

939
01:20:18,974 --> 01:20:21,169
Just how much trouble are you in, Bob?

940
01:20:21,243 --> 01:20:23,677
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.

941
01:20:23,745 --> 01:20:26,339
Oh, I believe everything you tell me.

942
01:20:26,415 --> 01:20:30,909
Tell me about gambling.
Do you have any luck left?

943
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:34,478
I'll tell you tomorrow.

944
01:20:43,799 --> 01:20:48,293
- Did you call the casino?
- They were closed, but I got you this.

945
01:20:55,377 --> 01:20:58,369
- Art.
- Yes, they reopened it last year.

946
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,248
Doesn't add up.

947
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:05,650
He's going to steal them in full view
on the busiest night of the year?

948
01:21:06,855 --> 01:21:10,450
You should get some sleep, boss.

949
01:21:10,525 --> 01:21:12,459
I know. I know I should.

950
01:21:43,558 --> 01:21:48,188
What the fuck are you doing?

951
01:22:39,815 --> 01:22:41,942
Hey, what's up, guys?

952
01:22:42,017 --> 01:22:44,076
Nothing lately.

953
01:22:44,152 --> 01:22:48,316
Sorry. Complications.
But better late than never.

954
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:54,228
Bertram, you have a place a guy could sleep
or is it only twin beds?

955
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:26,281
- I spoke to the casino,
and the manager had no worries.

956
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,659
He said the originals are quite secure
at a different location.

957
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:33,166
- The originals, huh?
- Yeah, in a vault at Villa St. Pierre.

958
01:23:33,233 --> 01:23:37,829
- The ones in the casino are copies for display.
- Oh, my God. It's a fake.

959
01:23:37,904 --> 01:23:41,237
Yes, they're all fakes. Pathetic, isn't it?

960
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:44,106
- No, it's beautiful.
- The fakes?

961
01:23:46,446 --> 01:23:48,914
- Anne.
- Hmm.

962
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:52,577
Do you know the first thing
to learn about gambling?

963
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:56,487
- What?
- Clothes.

964
01:23:56,556 --> 01:24:00,083
He or she should always look their best.

965
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:03,891
- And we don't quite make it.
- No.

966
01:24:03,964 --> 01:24:07,957
So, let's go shopping.

967
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:28,712
What about this?

968
01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:31,189
Turn around.

969
01:24:31,258 --> 01:24:33,249
Divine.

970
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:41,493
The best disguise in the world:
Tuxedo and some gel.

971
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:44,332
Albert, you got some gel?

972
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:49,540
- Gel.
- Thank you.

973
01:24:51,278 --> 01:24:54,679
Gel is essential
when things get complicated.

974
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:58,684
There.

975
01:25:01,755 --> 01:25:04,349
- We could almost be triplets.
- Hmm.

976
01:25:04,424 --> 01:25:06,824
- And do you know the second thing?
- Tell me.

977
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:09,657
- Gambling and dope don't mix.
- The third?

978
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:14,224
Always play the game to the limit.
Damn the consequences.

979
01:25:17,137 --> 01:25:20,868
Two teams. Six cars in the trap.
I take the villa. You take the casino.

980
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:24,274
- And be diplomatic with those monkeys in Monaco.
- What about Bob?

981
01:25:24,344 --> 01:25:27,108
You'll find him playing the tables,
expecting me to tail him.

982
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,740
- Just don't let him leave.
- Do I arrest him?

983
01:25:29,816 --> 01:25:31,750
For playing roulette?

984
01:25:49,369 --> 01:25:51,303
She had a bad end, Mimi.

985
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:55,330
But then tell me an opera
that has a happy ending.

986
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:57,343
- She died?
- Uh-huh.

987
01:26:12,726 --> 01:26:14,717
Anne.

988
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:23,135
You're gonna see fake glamor...

989
01:26:23,203 --> 01:26:26,832
serious money, and a lot
ofbad plastic surgery.

990
01:26:26,907 --> 01:26:30,399
But remember, the dice
falls the same for all of them.

991
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:33,537
- That's lesson number four?
- Five and six.

992
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:37,572
- Hey, where is Paulo?
- Paulo shot a snitch and had to run to San Remo.

993
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,381
- Do you think he got there, honey?
- I sincerely hope so.

994
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:45,551
Nothing we can do, Raoul, but play our parts,
and my part was to gamble. So let's gamble.

995
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:59,130
Where the fuck's Paulo?

996
01:27:15,589 --> 01:27:17,523
Hey, so just how fucked is it?

997
01:27:17,591 --> 01:27:19,582
- Don't know yet.
- Do we call it off?

998
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:23,857
- It's too late for that. How do we play this one, Anne?
- To the limit, I think?

999
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:27,491
You heard that, Raoul... to the limit.
Let's get some chips.

1000
01:27:39,145 --> 01:27:42,012
Cover the grounds. Check all the exits.

1001
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:44,175
Go, go, go, go!

1002
01:27:44,251 --> 01:27:47,345
No dead bodies tonight.

1003
01:27:55,529 --> 01:27:57,520
Do you know what a prime is, Anne?

1004
01:27:57,597 --> 01:28:01,465
- A number divisible by itself and one.
- You remembered. I'm touched.

1005
01:28:01,535 --> 01:28:04,129
- Don't play them tonight.
- Why not?

1006
01:28:04,204 --> 01:28:08,265
It's my birthday. I'm not a prime anymore.

1007
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,873
Yes!

1008
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:18,782
You broke it, Bob... your losing streak.

1009
01:28:18,852 --> 01:28:21,582
Lesson number seven, Anne,
and don't take it the wrong way.

1010
01:28:21,655 --> 01:28:24,419
Displays of emotion are kept to a minimum.

1011
01:28:29,563 --> 01:28:31,121
Thank you.

1012
01:28:53,253 --> 01:28:55,244
There.

1013
01:29:00,393 --> 01:29:03,385
There are plainclothes cops
all over, but nothing of Roger.

1014
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:06,955
- Someone's been singing, Bob.
- Yes, but I don't know what tune.

1015
01:29:07,033 --> 01:29:09,627
I could check out the villa.
If I see cops on the gate...

1016
01:29:09,703 --> 01:29:12,604
If you check out the villa,
you'll invite cops to the gate.

1017
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:15,266
Your choice, Raoul.

1018
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:19,335
- Round she goes. Where she ends, no one knows.
- Hmm.

1019
01:29:27,921 --> 01:29:30,856
I was right, you know... first time I met you.

1020
01:29:30,924 --> 01:29:34,553
Lucky eyes: One brown, one green.

1021
01:29:34,628 --> 01:29:36,960
- Should I get contacts?
- Mm-mm. Never.

1022
01:29:45,705 --> 01:29:49,801
Fucking Paulo. Fucking spiders.

1023
01:29:52,712 --> 01:29:55,408
We've got infrared sensors reading...

1024
01:29:55,482 --> 01:29:57,416
every centimeter down there.

1025
01:29:57,484 --> 01:30:01,443
If a fly buzzes in, the alarm sounds.
Seven digital cameras.

1026
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:04,957
He'll have gotten round your sensors
and gotten round your damn cameras.

1027
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:07,516
And the only question is
where he's comin' in from.

1028
01:30:07,594 --> 01:30:09,892
- Let's go downstairs.
- I'll have to disarm the system.

1029
01:30:09,963 --> 01:30:12,557
You're not listening.
I think you'll find he's done that for you.

1030
01:30:22,676 --> 01:30:26,840
- How much do you owe the cubist?
- One and a half million francs.

1031
01:30:26,913 --> 01:30:32,408
- Have you a long way to go, Bob?
- Rule number eight. Never tempt fate.

1032
01:30:51,371 --> 01:30:53,737
We win.

1033
01:31:32,045 --> 01:31:35,242
Every Alarm in the building
should be screaming by now.

1034
01:31:35,315 --> 01:31:38,512
That's technology for you...
always lets you down.

1035
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:41,748
And I bet he can't see us
on his monitors upstairs.

1036
01:31:47,093 --> 01:31:49,027
I think we've got a problem.

1037
01:31:59,205 --> 01:32:01,196
My God.

1038
01:32:04,344 --> 01:32:06,278
That doesn't let you down.

1039
01:32:18,725 --> 01:32:21,626
It would almost have been worth it, Bob.

1040
01:32:21,694 --> 01:32:23,685
- Who the fuck is Bob?
- Shh.

1041
01:32:26,366 --> 01:32:29,199
Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?

1042
01:32:29,269 --> 01:32:31,601
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

1043
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:34,162
Can you hear me? Hello.

1044
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,640
Hello? They're coming from underneath.
Check beneath the vault.

1045
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:39,234
Call your men from the casino immediately.

1046
01:32:39,312 --> 01:32:41,337
- Another lesson.
- What number is this?

1047
01:32:41,414 --> 01:32:43,575
Doesn't matter. Always tip.

1048
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:45,641
Private rooms.

1049
01:33:40,607 --> 01:33:43,041
It is not looking good, pal.

1050
01:34:00,526 --> 01:34:03,984
Fuck. Fuck!

1051
01:34:21,981 --> 01:34:24,176
- Aaah! What the fuck?
- Ow.!

1052
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:27,586
- Can't get through the pipe!
- Did you take care of that faucet?

1053
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:31,155
- Does it fucking look like it?
- The fucking gas!

1054
01:34:32,691 --> 01:34:34,659
I smell gas.

1055
01:34:36,094 --> 01:34:38,995
Get out of here!

1056
01:35:01,486 --> 01:35:06,321
- That's not quite Bob's style.
- What the fuck is Bob's style?

1057
01:35:06,391 --> 01:35:09,883
Somewhat more elegant.

1058
01:35:22,974 --> 01:35:25,374
Get in the car!

1059
01:35:29,814 --> 01:35:32,977
- Where is Philippa?
- Fuck Philippa. Go!

1060
01:35:39,524 --> 01:35:41,515
Fucking spiders.

1061
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,699
Hey, what's wrong with spiders?

1062
01:35:50,769 --> 01:35:52,703
Fucking spiders made it all go boom.

1063
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:54,898
- Boom, huh?
- Boom, fucking boom!

1064
01:35:59,644 --> 01:36:01,771
What we have is a full house.

1065
01:36:01,846 --> 01:36:07,807
- We wanna bet 600,000 francs. It pays 10 to one.
- Yeah.

1066
01:36:25,003 --> 01:36:28,495
That's 6 million francs we just won.

1067
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:35,479
Take this million francs, put it on the ante,
and watch his face.

1068
01:36:57,035 --> 01:37:00,436
Check all cars in and out of Monte Carlo.

1069
01:37:00,505 --> 01:37:04,635
They're looking for burned hair
and singed eyebrows. I'm going to the casino.

1070
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:07,439
- Casinos?
- Someone has to tell him he's blown it.

1071
01:37:39,277 --> 01:37:42,041
That's the manager.

1072
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:52,412
Bon soir, monsieur.

1073
01:38:11,242 --> 01:38:13,870
Last call.

1074
01:38:13,945 --> 01:38:16,209
- Says who?
- It's almost daylight.

1075
01:38:18,082 --> 01:38:20,073
Rosy-fingered dawn.

1076
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:02,552
- The house must retire.
- The house sleepy?

1077
01:39:02,627 --> 01:39:05,095
Cash, if you please. Large denominations.

1078
01:39:05,163 --> 01:39:08,929
And it's getting late.

1079
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,333
- The last rule.
- What?

1080
01:39:14,405 --> 01:39:20,105
If you're gonna win big,
do it with a girl called Anne.

1081
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:24,080
- Okay?
- Hmm.

1082
01:39:27,785 --> 01:39:30,481
- You had a good night, my friend?
- Exceptional. And you?

1083
01:39:30,555 --> 01:39:33,888
- Well, exceptional too. I crashed a party.
- What kind of a party?

1084
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:36,859
Well, a boom-fucking-boom one.
I apprehended a transvestite...

1085
01:39:36,928 --> 01:39:39,158
who had an interest in art and all along...

1086
01:40:19,537 --> 01:40:21,471
The safe is empty.

1087
01:40:56,441 --> 01:41:00,002
I could accept a post-dated check.

1088
01:41:00,078 --> 01:41:04,481
- Tell him again, will you?
- Well, it seems someone cracked the safe.

1089
01:41:04,549 --> 01:41:06,915
Tell him, hey, of all nights, just my luck.

1090
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:10,045
- And I am awaiting legal advice.
- How long must we wait?

1091
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:13,215
- I have a meeting in Paris.
- Shall we speed things up and arrest you now?

1092
01:41:13,291 --> 01:41:16,385
- Me? On what charges?
- Criminal conspiracy.

1093
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:20,227
- Criminal conspiracy can be hard to prove.
- Impossible in my case.

1094
01:41:20,298 --> 01:41:22,766
I've been here all evening.
Look at that crowd.

1095
01:41:22,834 --> 01:41:27,168
All witnesses to my presence.
My behavior? Impeccable, I would say.

1096
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:31,197
And to my luck, there hasn't been
a run of luck like that in Monte Carlo...

1097
01:41:31,275 --> 01:41:34,108
sinceJoseph Jaggers broke the bank in 1872.

1098
01:41:34,178 --> 01:41:39,013
- 1873, sir.
- There's one way, of course, the management could avoid paying.

1099
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:42,883
- What are you implying, sir?
- It's unthinkable that a casino would empty its own safe.

1100
01:41:42,954 --> 01:41:46,583
Its reputation...
Its reputation is without peer.

1101
01:41:46,657 --> 01:41:51,594
- And your implication is beneath contempt.
- As I said, unthinkable.

1102
01:41:56,667 --> 01:41:59,966
- We will insist on a full investigation.
- You certainly should.

1103
01:42:00,038 --> 01:42:02,529
I mean, I would if I was in your situation.

1104
01:42:02,607 --> 01:42:05,770
- Would you kindly put a "zock" in it, sir?
- A "zock"?

1105
01:42:08,112 --> 01:42:10,740
Put "zit" in this mouth of yours.

1106
01:42:10,815 --> 01:42:14,273
Oh, you mean I should retire with my winnings
and keep my mouth shut?

1107
01:42:14,352 --> 01:42:18,448
- I mean shut the fuck up.
- Mmm.

1108
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:23,389
Anne?

1109
01:42:38,576 --> 01:42:42,307
- Wow!
- Ah, fuck!

1110
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:46,908
- Yes! Yes! So, tell me again. Which twin are you?
- The identical one.

1111
01:42:46,984 --> 01:42:49,953
- And which share do you get?
- He gets mine. I get his.

1112
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:51,955
Do you always share this way?

1113
01:42:52,023 --> 01:42:53,957
- Sharin' means carin'.
- Okay, okay!

1114
01:42:56,761 --> 01:43:00,060
Hey, you won, you lunatic.

1115
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:02,759
It's not about winning, Roger.
It's about attitude.

1116
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:05,735
Win or lose, you gotta
do 'em both with grace.

1117
01:43:05,803 --> 01:43:09,705
- You learn that in recovery?
- Change the things you can. Accept the things you can't.

1118
01:43:09,774 --> 01:43:11,765
And learn the wisdom
to know the difference.

1119
01:43:11,843 --> 01:43:15,301
Ah, so, what's the difference between
a run of luck and a casino heist?

1120
01:43:15,379 --> 01:43:18,246
Then again, Roger,
there are some eventualities...

1121
01:43:18,316 --> 01:43:20,250
that recovery doesn't prepare you for.

1122
01:43:20,318 --> 01:43:22,252
No. No, no. No difference, Bob.

1123
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,311
- Very little, if you think about it.
- Well...

1124
01:43:24,388 --> 01:43:27,619
there'll be an investigation,
and I'll have to insist you stay in France.

1125
01:43:27,692 --> 01:43:30,160
- I'll never leave France.
- It could take some time.

1126
01:43:30,228 --> 01:43:32,719
- You'll have to talk to my lawyer.
- Who's your lawyer?

1127
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:35,095
Have you any suggestions?

1128
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:39,125
I have a friend of yours in custody
who'll need the best that money can buy.

1129
01:43:39,203 --> 01:43:44,436
I'd be careful, Roger. With this much money
she could sue you for damages.

1130
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:46,500
Mm-hmm?

1131
01:43:54,385 --> 01:43:59,186
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You made it up to me.
Now, get off the phone. Yeah.

1132
01:43:59,257 --> 01:44:01,487
- You don't want to talk to Paulo, right?
- No.

1133
01:44:01,559 --> 01:44:06,087
- Tell him he doesn't live up to my ideal of manhood.
- Is there anyone who does?

1134
01:44:06,164 --> 01:44:08,098
- Yeah.
- Who?

1135
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:10,396
- My father.
- Oh.

1136
01:44:10,468 --> 01:44:12,436
He was a circus strong man.

1137
01:44:12,503 --> 01:44:16,496
He used to hang my mother from a high wire,
suspended from his teeth.

1138
01:44:16,574 --> 01:44:21,011
- Then one day his teeth broke.
- And?

1139
01:44:21,078 --> 01:44:25,538
She got two false legs,
and he got two false teeth.

1140
01:44:25,616 --> 01:44:28,176
You're bullshitting me.

1141
01:44:28,252 --> 01:44:30,186
You sure?

1142
01:44:30,254 --> 01:44:32,188
Yes.

1143
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:37,091
You know, my mother was a rodeo queen,
and she used to wrangle bulls...
