- Thank you.
- [Bob] Guess what that is.

767
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,652
- What?
- The old Napoleonic sewers.

768
00:56:38,718 --> 00:56:40,987
They run downhill
towards the sea.

That's our way in.
Turn that off. We can watch it later.

with money you lent me.

- You're mad, Yvonne.
What put that idea in your head?

If you get yourself arrested,
you wouldn't survive, you bastard.

in the manager's office, I'm on the floor.

804
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:11,787
- The staff take me for him.
- He has access to the safe,
and my alibi is solid as a rock.

- No one in Monte Carlo.

Right, Paulo?
- Or three.

How's he gonna know
they're twins? Tell you what.

I'll go out the front. Try to lose Roger.

Start without me
if you have to.

Would you drive me, Roger? I have a meeting.
I'm attending Narcotics Anonymous.

- You know, every addict,
Roger, has an enabler.
- Nobody tells me anything.

832
01:01:06,852 --> 01:01:10,530
The one who, through no fault of their own,
maintains the addict in their habit.

- Is you.

835

We're codependents, Roger.
We have been for years.

I mean,
look at you, now.

837
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:25,091
You're chasin' me, because you imagine
that I'm chasin' a big score.

838
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:28,258
- [Laughs]
- And maybe the cure starts with you.

839
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:32,190
- The cure?
- Yeah, because deep down
you want me to try that big one...

840
01:01:32,264 --> 01:01:34,174
if only to see
how I'd do it.

841
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:37,347
There's nothing I can do
that'll convince you that I'm clean.

842
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:39,304
It's unhealthy, Roger.

We can explore these issues further.

- Are you sure?
- The cure starts now. Say it.

849
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:06,410
- Say what?
- "My name is Roger. I'm an addict in recovery."

So, Remi, have I gone up in the world,
or come down?

869
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:57,432
From my perspective,
you're kind of standing still.

870
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,803
You can't move
standing still?

871
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,553
I think you should
value yourself more highly.

Think he's right, Said?

- Depends.
- Depends on what?

- On what you're selling.
- Damaged goods. That's me.

Would you prefer
to discuss this in private?

No. No, no.
No difference, Bob.

Have you any suggestions?

1269

I have a friend of yours in custody
who'll need the best that money can buy.

1270
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:30,276
I'd be careful, Roger. With this much money
she could sue you for damages.

Mm-hmm?

- My father.
- Oh.

1277
01:39:55,245 --> 01:39:57,133
He was a circus strong man.

1278
01:39:57,197 --> 01:40:01,027
He used to hang my mother from a high wire,
suspended from his teeth.

- Then one day his teeth broke.

She got two false legs,
and he got two false teeth.

You're bullshitting me.

Yes.
