1
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,223
Forget it

2
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,225
lt's too risky

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,660
l'm through doing that shit

4
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,229
You always say that, the same thing
every time

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,231
'"l'm through, never again
too dangerous'"

6
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,164
l know that's what l always say

7
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,394
l'm always right, too

8
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,604
But you forget about it in a day or two

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,106
Yeah, well, the days of me forgetting
are over

10
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,970
and the days of me remembering
have just begun

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,672
You know when you go on like this
what you sound like?

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,676
l sound like a sensible fucking man
that's what l sound like

13
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,076
You sound like a duck
Quack, quack, quack

14
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,146
quack, quack, quack, quack
quack, quack

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,876
Yeah, well, take heart, because you're
never gonna have to hear it again

16
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,382
Because...since l'm never gonna
do it again

17
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,049
you're never gonna have to hear me
quack about

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,018
how l'm never gonna do it again

19
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,316
After tonight

20
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,388
Correct. l got all tonight to quack

21
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,195
Can l get anyone more coffee?

22
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,125
Oh, Yes

23
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,501
Thank you

24
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:10,260
You're welcome

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,868
l mean, the way it is now

26
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,240
you're taking the same risk as when
you rob a bank

27
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,102
You take more of a risk
Banks are easier

28
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,041
Federal Banks ain't supposed to
stop you in any way during a robbery

29
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,010
They're insured. Why should they
give a fuck?

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,145
You don't even need a gun in
a Federal Bank

31
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:26,748
l heard about this one bloke

32
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,648
he walks into a bank with
a portable phone

33
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,483
He gives the phone to the teller

34
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,190
bloke on the other end of
the phone says

35
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,416
'"We got this guy's little girl'"

36
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,924
'"lf you don't give him all your money
we're gonna kill her'"

37
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,025
Did it work?

38
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:37,754
Fucking way, it works

39
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:38,588
That's what l'm talking about!

40
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,492
Knucklehead walks into a bank with
a telephone

41
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,795
not a pistol, not a shotgun
a fucking phone

42
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,561
Cleans the place out

43
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,136
they don't even lift a fucking finger

44
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,203
Did they hurt the little girl?

45
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,307
l don't know. There probably never was
a little girl in the first place

46
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,173
W...Well, the point of the story isn't
the little girl

47
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,075
The point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone

48
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,807
You want to rob banks?

49
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:58,980
l'm not saying l want to rob banks

50
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,813
l'm just illustrating if we did, it would be
easier than what we been doing

51
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,181
And no more liquor stores?

52
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,151
What we been talking about?

53
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,723
Yeah, no more liquor stores

54
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,386
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be

55
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,288
There's too many foreigners own
liquor stores

56
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,190
Vietnamese, Koreans

57
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,420
they don't even speak fucking English

58
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,529
You tell them, '"Empty out the register'"

59
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,096
They don't know what the fuck you're
talking about

60
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,225
They make it too personal

61
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,494
We keep on, one of these gook fucker's
gonna make us kill him

62
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,496
l'm not gonna kill anybody

63
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,139
l don't want to kill anybody, either

64
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,568
But they'll probably put us in a situation

65
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,037
where it's us or them

66
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,440
And if it's not the gooks

67
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,906
lt's these old fucking Jews

68
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,945
who've owned the store for
15 fucking generations

69
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,481
You got grandpa lrving sitting behind
the counter

70
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,345
with a fucking magnum in his hand

71
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,487
Try walking into one of those places

72
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,018
with nothing but a phone, see how far
that gets you

73
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,849
Fuck it. Forget it. We're out of it

74
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,854
Yeah, well, what then? Day jobs?

75
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,360
Not in this life

76
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,550
What, then?

77
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,962
Garcon! Coffee!

78
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:47,764
This place

79
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,534
Garcon means '"boys'"

80
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,039
This place?

81
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,539
A coffee shop?

82
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,013
What's wrong with that?

83
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,774
Nobody ever robs restaurants

84
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,283
Why not?

85
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,821
Bars, liquor stores

86
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,878
gas stations

87
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,921
You get your head blown off sticking up
one of them

88
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,355
Restaurants, on the other hands

89
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,086
you catch with their pants down

90
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,059
They're not expecting to get robbed

91
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,789
Not as expecting, anyway

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,936
l bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this

93
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,733
Correct. Same as bank
these places are insured

94
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,510
Manager...he don't give a fuck

95
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,610
He's just trying to get you out the door

96
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,277
before you start plugging the diners

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,072
Waitresses? Fucking forget it

98
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,273
No way they're taking a bullet
for the register

99
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,476
Busboys, some wetback getting paid
$1 .50 an hour

100
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,248
really give a fuck you're stealing
from the owner?

101
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,957
Customers sitting there with food
in their mouths

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,285
They don't know what's going on

103
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,824
One minute they're having
a Denver Omelette

104
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,893
next minute someone's sticking a gun
in their face

105
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,698
See, l got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. Remember?

106
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,636
All the customers kept coming in?

107
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,633
Yeah

108
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,597
.You got the idea taking their wallets
.Mm.hmmm

109
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,674
.Now, that was a good idea
.Thank you

110
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,606
Made more from the wallets than
we did from the register

111
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,711
Yes, we did

112
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,639
A lot of people come to restaurants

113
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,109
A lot of wallets

114
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,280
Pretty smart, huh?

115
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,286
Pretty smart

116
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,783
l'm ready. Let's do it. Right now
right here

117
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,252
Come on

118
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,189
All right

119
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,753
Same as last time, remember?

120
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,464
You're crowd control
l handle employees

121
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,504
l love you, Pumpkin

122
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,971
l love you, Honey Bunny

123
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,375
Everybody, be cool! This is a robbery!

124
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,543
Any of you fucking pricks move

125
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,649
and l'll execute every motherfucking
last one of you!

126
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,582
Ha Ha Ha

127
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,090
Jungle Boogie

128
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,800
Jungle Boogie

129
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,366
Get it on

130
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,126
Jungle Boogie

131
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:45,763
Jungle Boogie

132
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:46,802
Get it on

133
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,234
Jungle Boogie

134
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,164
Get up with the boogie

135
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,239
Jungle Boogie

136
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:50,942
Get up with the get down

137
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:51,700
Jungle Boogie

138
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,171
Get down with the boogie

139
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,907
Jungle Boogie

140
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,513
Come and shake it around

141
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,547
OK, so tell me again about
the hash bars

142
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,623
OK. What you want to know?

143
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,154
Hash is legal there, right?

144
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,023
Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal

145
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,028
You just can't walk into a restaurant

146
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,132
roll a joint, and start puffing away

147
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,865
l mean, they want you to smoke
in your home

148
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,536
or certain designated places

149
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,929
And those are hash bars?

150
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,437
Yeah, it breaks down like this, OK?

151
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,868
lt's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it

152
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,001
and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar

153
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,270
it's legal to sell it

154
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,938
lt's legal to carry it, but...but that
doesn't matter

155
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,810
Beause, get a load of this, all right?

156
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,952
lf you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam

157
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,916
it's illegal for them to search you

158
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,687
l mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don't have

159
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,358
Oh, man, l'm going

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,322
That's all there is to it

161
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,322
l'm fucking going

162
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,359
l know, baby. You'd did it the most

163
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,999
But you know what the funniest thing
about Europe is?

164
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:48,657
What?

165
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,027
lt's the little differences

166
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,833
l mean, they got the same shit
over there

167
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,369
that they got here, but it's just

168
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,631
just there it's a little different

169
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,535
Example?

170
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,209
All right, well, you can walk into a movie
theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer

171
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,274
And l don't mean just, like, in no
paper cup

172
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,108
l'm talking about a glass of beer

173
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,750
And in Paris, you can buy a beer
at McDonald's

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,847
And you know what they call a
quarter.pounder with cheese in Paris?

175
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,649
They don't call it a quarter.pounder
with cheese?

176
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,190
No, man, they got the Metric System
there

177
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,088
They wouldn't know what the fuck a
quarter.pounder is

178
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,091
What do they call it?

179
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,925
They call it a '"Royale with Cheese'"

180
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,191
Royale with Cheese

181
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,162
That's right

182
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,494
What do they call a Big Mac?

183
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,599
Well, Big Mac's a Big Mac
but they call it '"Le Big Mac'"

184
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,899
Le Big Mac. Ha ha ha ha

185
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,406
What do they call a whopper?

186
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,342
l don't know. l didn't go into Burger King

187
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,804
You know what they put on French Fries
in Holland instead of Ketchup?

188
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:37,608
What?

189
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,441
Mayonnaise

190
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,640
Goddamn!

191
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,911
Ha ha ha. l've seen them do it, man

192
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,621
They fucking drown them in that shit

193
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,585
Yuck

194
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,418
We should have shotguns for this kind
of deal

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,395
.How many up there? .3 or 4

196
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,163
That's counting our guy?

197
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,038
l'm not sure

198
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,104
So that means it could be up to 5 guys
up there?

199
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,106
lt's possible

200
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,410
We should have fucking shotguns

201
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,443
What's her name?

202
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,205
Mia

203
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,077
Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet?

204
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,252
l don't know. However people
meet people

205
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,086
She used to be an actress

206
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,349
Oh, really? She do anything
l'd have seen?

207
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,488
l think her biggest deal was she starred
in a pilot

208
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,060
Pilot? What's a pilot?

209
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,821
Well, you know the shows on TV?

210
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,660
l don't watch TV

211
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah, but you are aware that there's
an invention called television

212
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,338
and on this invention they show shows
right?

213
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,603
Yeah

214
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,537
Well, the way they pick TV shows is
they make one show

215
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,142
That show's called a pilot

216
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,608
Then they show that one show to the
people who pick shows

217
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,940
and on the strength of that one show

218
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,980
they decide if they want to make
more shows

219
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,652
Some get chosen and become
television programs

220
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,946
Some don't, become nothing

221
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,681
She starred in one of the ones that
became nothing

222
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,791
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

223
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,191
Half.Black, half.Samoan, used to
call him '"Tony Rocky Horrow'"?

224
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,266
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

225
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,297
l wouldn't go so far as to call the
Brother Fat

226
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,332
l mean, he got a weight problem

227
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,060
What's the nigger gonna do
he's Samoan

228
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,261
Yeah, l think l know who you mean

229
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,269
What about him?

230
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,567
Well, Marsellus fucked him up good

231
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,004
Word around the campfire is

232
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,406
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife

233
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,617
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

234
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,792
No, no, no, no, no. Nothing that bad

235
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,248
Well, then, what, then?

236
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,453
Gave her a foot massage

237
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,461
A foot massage?

238
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,026
.That's it? .Mm.hmm

239
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,161
Then what did Marsellus do?

240
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,197
Sent a couple of cats over to his place

241
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,805
They took him out on his patio

242
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,566
threw his ass over the balcony

243
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,778
Nigger fell 4 stories

244
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,606
They had a little garden down
at the bottom

245
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,715
enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse

246
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,746
Nigger fell through that

247
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,119
Since then, he kind of developed
a speech impediment

248
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,290
That's a damn shame

249
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,389
But still, l have to say

250
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,360
you play with matches, you get burned

251
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,330
What do you mean?

252
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:13,162
You don't be giving Marsellus Wallace's
new bride a foot massage

253
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,862
You don't think he overreacted?

254
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,510
Well, Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react the way he did

255
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,737
but he had to expect a reaction

256
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,914
lt was a foot massage. A foot massage
is nothing

257
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,776
l give my mother a foot massage

258
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,283
No, it's laying hands in a familiar way
on Marsellus' new wife

259
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,087
l mean, is it as bad as eating her
pussy out?

260
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,315
No, but it's the same fucking ballpark

261
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop right there

262
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,889
Eating a bitch out and giving a bitch
a foot massage

263
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,425
aint' even the same fucking thing

264
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,260
lt's not. lt's the same ballpark

265
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,298
Ain't and fucking ballpack, neither

266
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,301
Now, look, maybe your method of
massage differs from mine

267
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,132
but you know touching his wife's feet

268
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,638
and sticking your tongue in her holiest
of holies ain't the same fucking ballpark

269
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,672
lt ain't the same league

270
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,310
lt ain't even the same fucking sport

271
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,446
Look, foot massages don't mean shit

272
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,544
Have you ever given a foot massage?

273
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,579
Don't be telling me about
foot massages

274
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,313
.l'm the foot fucking master
.You given a lot of them?

275
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,113
Shit, yeah

276
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,584
Got my technique down and everything

277
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,224
l don't be tickling or nothing

278
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,991
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

279
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:12,863
Fuck you

280
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,062
.You given them a lot? .Fuck you

281
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,669
You know, l'm kind of tired

282
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,236
l could use a foot massage myself

283
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,771
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off

284
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,269
l'm getting a little pissed here

285
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,173
.This is the door .There it is

286
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,010
What time you got?

287
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,647
7:22 in the a.m

288
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,448
No, it ain't quite time yet

289
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,850
Come on. Let's hang back

290
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,194
Now, look, just 'cause l wouldn't give

291
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,561
no man a foot massage don't
make it right

292
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,361
For Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building

293
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:53,763
into a glass motherfucking house

294
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,165
fucking up the way the nigger talks

295
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,271
That shit ain't right

296
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,839
Motherfucker do that shit to me

297
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,136
he better paralyze my ass
Because l'd kill the motherfucker

298
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:00,902
you know what l'm saying?

299
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,478
l ain't saying it's right

300
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,309
But you're saying a foot massage don't
mean nothing

301
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,778
and l'm saying it does

302
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,076
Now, look, l've given a million ladies

303
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,512
a million foot massages, and they all
meant something

304
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,417
Now, we act like they don't, but they do

305
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,388
That's what's so fucking cool about them

306
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,788
There's a sensuous thing going on
where, you know

307
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,862
you don't talk about it, but you know it
and she knows it

308
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,532
Fucking Marsellus knew it

309
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,928
and Antwan should've fucking better
known better

310
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,694
l mean, that's his fucking wife, man

311
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,840
This ain't a man with a sense of humor
about this shit

312
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,702
You know what l'm saying?

313
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,945
lt's an interesting point

314
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,412
Come on. Let's get into character

315
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,114
What's her name again?

316
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,790
.Mia .Mia

317
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,789
Why you so interested in big man's wife?

318
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,223
Well, he's going out of town, Florida

319
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,022
and he asked me if l'd...take care of
her while he's gone

320
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,890
Take care of her?

321
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,228
No, man. Just take her out

322
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,896
You known, show her a good time

323
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,595
Make sure she don't get lonely

324
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,798
You're gonna be taking Mia Wallace out
on a date?

325
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,604
lt is not a date. You know

326
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,578
it's just like if you were going to take you
buddy's wife to a movie or something

327
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,579
lt's just good company, that's all

328
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,584
lt's not a date

329
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,750
lt's a definitely not a date

330
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,492
Hey, kids

331
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,862
How you boys doing?

332
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,870
Hey, keep chilling

333
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,238
You know who we are?

334
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,152
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace

335
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,147
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

336
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,422
Now, let me take a wild guess here

337
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,900
.You're Brett, right? .Yeah

338
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,261
l thought so

339
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,467
You remember your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, don't you, Brett?

340
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,036
Yeah, l remember him

341
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,904
Good

342
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,302
Looks like me an Vincent caught you
boys at breakfast

343
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,847
Sorry about that. What you having?

344
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,108
Hamburgers

345
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,583
Hamburgers!

346
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,550
The cornerstone of any nutritious
breakfast

347
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,554
What kind of hamburgers?

348
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,255
Ch...ch...cheeseburgers

349
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,088
No, no, no, no, no
Where'd you get them?

350
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,492
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack.ln.The.Box
where?

351
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,758
Um, Big Kahuna Burger

352
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,026
Big Kahuna Burger

353
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,863
That's that Hawaiian Burger Joint

354
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,935
l hear they got some tasty burgers

355
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,097
l ain't never had one myself
How are they?

356
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,208
They're good

357
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,140
You mind if l try one of yours?

358
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,276
This is yours here, right?

359
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,108
Yeah

360
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:03,425
Mmm! This is a tasty burger

361
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,364
Vincent, you ever had a
Big Kahuna Burger?

362
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,493
Want a bite? They're real tasty

363
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,303
l ain't hungry

364
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,938
Well, if you like burgers, give them
a try sometime

365
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,198
Me, l can't usually get them

366
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,998
Because my girlfriend's a vegetarian

367
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,407
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian

368
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,574
but l do love the taste of a good burger

369
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:28,016
Mmm. You know what they call a
quarter.pounder with cheese in France?

370
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,446
.No .Tell him, Vincent

371
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,090
Royale with Cheese

372
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,824
Royale with Cheese

373
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,794
You know why they call it that?

374
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,861
Um...because of the Metric System?

375
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,736
Check out the big brain on Brett!

376
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,498
You're a smart motherfucker

377
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,640
That's right. The Metric System

378
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,244
.What's in this? .Sprite

379
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,572
Sprite, good

380
00:16:55,781 --> 00:17:00,081
You mind if l have some of your tasty
beverage to wash this down with?

381
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:01,482
Go right ahead

382
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,664
That hit the spot

383
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,963
You, flock of seagulls

384
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,138
You know why we're here?

385
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,967
Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid at?

386
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,004
lt's over there

387
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,305
l don't remember asking you a
goddamn thing!

388
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,383
You were saying?

389
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,980
lt's in the cupboard

390
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,317
N...no
The one by your kn...knees

391
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,915
We happy?

392
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,251
Vincent?

393
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,352
We happy?

394
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,613
Yeah, we happy

395
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,191
l'm sorry, uh, l...l didn't get your name

396
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,660
l got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?

397
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,696
But... but...l...l never got yours

398
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,594
My name's Pitt, and your ass

399
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,166
Ain't talking your way out of this shit

400
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,631
No, no, no

401
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,365
l just want you to know how

402
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,708
l just want you to know how sorry we are

403
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,145
that... that things got so fucked up
with us and...and Mr. Wallace

404
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,251
l...lt...W...We got into this thing with
the best intentions, really

405
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,351
l never inten

406
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:44,883
Oh, l'm sorry

407
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,624
Did l break your concentration?

408
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,819
l didn't mean to do that

409
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,688
Please, continue

410
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,663
You were saying something about
'"best intentions'"

411
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,092
What's the matter?

412
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,794
Oh, Y...You were finished?

413
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,365
Oh, well, allow me to retort

414
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,280
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?

415
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,276
What?

416
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,944
What country are you from?

417
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:14,778
Wh...what?

418
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,545
'"What'" ain't no country l ever heard of!

419
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,017
They speak English in '"what'"?

420
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,256
W... what?

421
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,583
English, motherfucker! Do you speak it?

422
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,193
Yes

423
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,792
.Then you know what l'm saying
.Yes!

424
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,398
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

425
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,294
What? l

426
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,765
Say '"what'" again! Say '"what'" again!

427
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,972
l dare you! l double.dare you
motherfucker!

428
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,140
Say '"what'" one more goddamn time!

429
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,968
H...H...He's black

430
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:38,666
Go on!

431
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,473
He's bald

432
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,841
.Does he look like a bitch?
.What?

433
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:50,045
.Does he look like a bitch?
.No

434
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,813
Then why you trying to fuck him like
a bitch, Brett?

435
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,491
.l didn't .Yes, you did

436
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,818
Yes, you did, Brett!

437
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,118
You tried to fuck him

438
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:57,761
No

439
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:02,832
Marcellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace

440
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:04,997
You read the Bible, Brett?

441
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,704
Y...yes

442
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,305
Well, there's this passage l got
memorized, sort of fits this occasion

443
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,808
Ezekiel 25:17

444
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:19,213
The path of the the righteous man
is beset on all sides

445
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,980
by the inequities of the selfish
and tyranny of evil men

446
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:29,392
Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will

447
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,496
shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness

448
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,859
for he is truly his brother's keeper

449
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,101
and the finder of lost children

450
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,961
And l will strike down upon thee

451
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,733
with great vengeance and furious anger

452
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,313
those who attempt to poison and
destroy my brothers

453
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,177
And you will know my name is the lord

454
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,546
when l lay my vengeance upon thee!

455
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:57,344
No!

456
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,935
Let's stay together

457
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,732
l think you're gonna find

458
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,634
when all this shit is over and done

459
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,513
l think you're gonna find yourself one
smiling motherfucker

460
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:33,947
Thing is, Butch, right now your got ability

461
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:40,931
But painful as it may be, ability don't last

462
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,431
And your days are just about over

463
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,533
Now, that's a hard motherfucker fact
of life

464
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,766
but that's a fact of life

465
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,479
your ass is gonna have to get
realistic about

466
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:03,244
See, this business is filled to the brim
with unrealistic motherfuckers

467
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,225
motherfuckers who thought their ass
would age like wine

468
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,998
lf you mean it turns to vinegar, it does

469
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,697
lf you mean it gets better with age
it don't

470
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,467
Besides, Butch

471
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,343
How many fights you think you got
in you, anyway?

472
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,740
Hmm?

473
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,547
2?

474
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,415
Boxers don't have an old.timer's day

475
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,191
You came close, but you never made it

476
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,717
And if you were gonna make it

477
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,758
you would have made it before now

478
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,477
You my nigger?

479
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,713
lt certainly appears so

480
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,564
Night of the fight, you may feel
a slight sting

481
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,971
That's pride fucking with you

482
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,272
Fuck pride!

483
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,440
Pride only hurts

484
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,177
lt never helps

485
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,947
You fight through that shit

486
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,420
Because a year from now, when you're
kicking it in the Caribbean

487
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:54,356
you're gonna say to yourself
'"Marsellus Wallace was right'"

488
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,760
l got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace

489
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,700
ln the fifth, your ass goes down

490
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,005
Say it

491
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,153
ln the fifth, my ass goes down

492
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,118
Yo, Vincent Vega, our man
in Amsterdam

493
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,317
Jules Winnfield, our man in lnglewood

494
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,925
Get your asses on in here!

495
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,396
Goddamn, nigger!

496
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,497
What's up with them clothes?

497
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,565
You don't even want to know

498
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,761
Where's the big man?

499
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,064
Big man's right over there taking care
of some business

500
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,708
Why don't you hang back for a second
or 2, you know?

501
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,002
You see the white boy leave
just go on over

502
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,315
How you been?

503
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,046
l've been doing pretty good
How about yourself?

504
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,115
All right

505
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,983
So, l hear you're taking Mia out
tomorrow?

506
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,725
At Marsellus' request

507
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,292
Have you met Mia?

508
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,365
Not yet

509
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:05,961
What's so fucking funny?

510
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,227
Not a goddamn thing

511
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,539
l got to piss

512
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,541
Look, l'm not a fucking idiot, all right?

513
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,169
lt's the big man's wife

514
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,642
l'm gonna sit across from her

515
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,279
chew my food with my mouth closed

516
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,040
laugh at her fucking jokes, and that's it

517
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,185
Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's
between you all

518
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,654
Then what did you fucking ask me
about it for?

519
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,189
Asshole

520
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,257
Give me a pack of Red Apples

521
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,024
.Filters? .Nah

522
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,638
You looking at something, friend?

523
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,632
You ain't my friend, palooka

524
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,243
What was that?

525
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,279
l think you heard me just fine, punchy

526
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,844
Vincent Vega's in the house?

527
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,609
My nigger

528
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,352
Get your ass over here

529
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,592
You'd never do that to me

530
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,319
What's up?

531
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,954
l'm sorry

532
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,292
Don't worry about it

533
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,859
Pack of Red Apples

534
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,462
$1 .40

535
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,099
And some matches

536
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:27,515
lt's as if it turns every part of your body
into the tip of a penis

537
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:28,713
Wow

538
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,718
l'll lend it to you. lt's a great book
on piercing

539
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,753
Well, you see how they use that gun
to pierce your ears?

540
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,893
They don't use that to pierce your
nipples, too, do they?

541
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,860
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing

542
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,624
All my piercing

543
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:42,800
18 places on my body

544
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,832
every one of them done with a needle

545
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,600
5 in each ear

546
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,500
One through the nipple of my left breast

547
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,269
2 in my right nostril

548
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:51,600
One in my left eyebrow

549
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,209
One in my belly. One in my lip

550
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,467
One in my clit

551
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,443
And l wear a stud in my tongue

552
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,047
Excuse me

553
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,978
l was just curious, but, um

554
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,016
why would you wear a stud in
your tongue?

555
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,678
lt's a sex thing

556
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,618
Helps fellatio

557
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:08,856
Vincenzo

558
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,323
Step into my office

559
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,097
This is Panda, from Mexico

560
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,169
Very good stuff

561
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,632
Now, that's Bava

562
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,399
Different, but equally good

563
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,938
And that is Choco

564
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,738
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany

565
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,706
Now, the first two are the same

566
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,142
300 a gram. Those are friend prices

567
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,543
But this one is a little more expensive

568
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,153
This is 500 a gram

569
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,055
but when you shoot it

570
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,350
you will know where that extra money
went

571
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,060
Now, there's nothing wrong with
these two

572
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,421
This is real, real, real good shit

573
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:48,291
But this one is a fucking madman

574
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,765
Remember, l just got back from
Amsterdam

575
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,395
Am l a nigger?

576
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,301
Are we in lnglewood? No
You're in my home

577
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,469
Now, white people who know
the difference

578
00:27:58,643 --> 00:27:59,769
between good shit and bad shit

579
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,275
This is the house they come to

580
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,877
Now, my shit, l'll take the Pepsi
challenge with that Amsterdam shit

581
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,744
any old day of the fucking week

582
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,350
That's a bold statement

583
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,344
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince

584
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,988
This is a seller's market

585
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,187
Coke is fucking dead as...dead

586
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,156
Heroin is coming back in a big
fucking way

587
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,300
All right, give me 3 grams of madman

588
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,130
OK

589
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,497
And if it's as good as you say it is

590
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,467
l'll come back and buy another thousand

591
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,641
Well, l just hope that l still have some
left for you

592
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,679
But...l'm giving you some out of my own
private stash

593
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,370
That is what a nice guy l am

594
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,608
Hey, l'm out of balloons

595
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,786
ls a baggie all right?

596
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,884
Yeah, that's cool

597
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,952
All right. l'll just get one for you

598
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:50,150
Honey, will you get me some baggies
and, uh, twistix from the kitchen?

599
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:51,123
OK

600
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,293
Hey, uh, what do you think about Trudi?

601
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,296
She ain't got a boyfriend

602
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,560
You want to, uh, hang out, get high?

603
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,928
Which one is Trudi?

604
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,727
The one with all the shit in her face

605
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,139
No, that's Jody

606
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:04,936
That's my wife

607
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,304
That one hurt, man

608
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,005
Thank you

609
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,545
No, l can't

610
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,045
Um, l gotta be someplace

611
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,218
Oh, all right. No problem

612
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,475
l'll take a rain check

613
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,617
Thank you, Jody

614
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,689
Still got your Malibu?

615
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,286
Ah, man

616
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,294
You know what some fucker did
the other day?

617
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,261
What?

618
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,500
Fucking keyed it

619
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,702
Oh, man, that's fucked up

620
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,061
Tell me about it

621
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,636
l had it in storage for 3 years

622
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,432
lt was out of 5 days

623
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,009
and some dickless piece of shit fucked
with it

624
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,543
They should be fucking killed, man

625
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,181
No trial, no jury, straight to execution

626
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,747
Boy, l wish l could've caught him
doing it

627
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,681
l'd have given anything to catch that
asshole doing it

628
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,755
lt's been worth him doing it just so
l could've caught him doing it

629
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:53,856
What a fucker!

630
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,788
What's more chicken shit than fucking
with a man's automobile?

631
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,225
l mean, don't fuck with another
man's vehicle

632
00:29:59,397 --> 00:29:59,920
You don't do it

633
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,393
lt's just against the rules

634
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:02,525
Thank you

635
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,632
Thank you

636
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,163
Mind if l shoot up here?

637
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,032
Hey, mi casa, su casa

638
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,630
Muchas gracias

639
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,621
Hello?

640
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,360
Billy Ray was a preacher's son

641
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,330
And when his daddy would visit
he'd come along

642
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,302
Vincent

643
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,136
Vincent

644
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,400
l'm on the intercom

645
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,242
Where is it? Where is the intercom?

646
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,314
lt's on the wall by the 2 African fellows

647
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,110
To your right

648
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,777
...was the son of a preacher man

649
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,818
The only boy

650
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,286
Warm

651
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,691
Warmer

652
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,688
Disco

653
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,488

Push the button if you want to talk

655
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,259
Hello

656
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,331
Go make yourself a drink, and l'll be
down in 2 shakes of a lamb's tail

657
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,698
The bar is by the fireplace

658
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,002
...being good isn't always easy

659
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,702
OK

660
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,314
When he started sweet.talking to me

661
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,111
He'd come and tell me everything
is all right

662
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,686
He'd kiss and tell me everything
is all right

663
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,948
Can l get away again tonight?

664
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,888
The only one who could ever reach me

665
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,188
was the son of a preacher man

666
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,194
The only boy who could ever teach me

667
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,196
was the son of a preacher man

668
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,132
Yes, he was, he was

669
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,436
Lord knows he was

670
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,407
Ooh, yes, he was

671
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,735
How well l remember

672
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,177
The look that was in his eyes

673
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,749
Stealing kisses from me on the sly

674
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,113
Taking time to make time

675
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,079
Telling me that he's all mine

676
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,555
Learning from each other's knowing

677
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,024
Looking to see how much we've grown

678
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,889
And the only one who could ever
reach me

679
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,191
Was the son of a preacher man

680
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,063
The only boy who could ever teach me

681
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,965
Was the son of a preacher man

682
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,869
Yes, he was, he was

683
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,343
Oh, yes, he was

684
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,669
Let's go

685
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,011
What the fuck is this place?

686
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,186
This is Jack Rabbit Slim's

687
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,186
An Elvis man should love it

688
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,319
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak

00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,741
Mm.hmm

756

That's a shake. That's a milk and
ice cream

00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,741
Last l heard

You don't put Bourbon in it or nothing?

00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:49,466
To cry my troubles away

765
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,462
Could you, um

766
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,970
Roll me one of those, cowboy?

767

You can have this one, cowgirl

Thanks

00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,279
...with regret

770
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,145
Think nothing of it

771
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,844
...Lonesome town

772
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,451
l can lean to forget

773
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,590
So

774
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,593
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam

775
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:17,856
Sure did

776
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,087
How long were you there?

777
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,132
Just over 3 years

778
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,397
l go there about once a year to chill out
for a month

779
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,270
No Kidding?

780
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,100
l didn't know that

781
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,970
Why would you?

782
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,550
l heard you did a pilot

783
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,354
That was my 15 minutes

784
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,149
What was it?

785
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,588
lt was a show about a team of female
secret agents called Fox Force Five

786
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,825
What?

787
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,463
Fox Force Five

788
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,893
Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks

789
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,398
Force, as in we're a force to be
reckoned with

790
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,264
And Five, as in there's 1 , 2, 3, 4
five of us

791
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,871
There was a blond one
Somerset O'Neal

792
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,064
She was the leader

793
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:08,240
The Japanese fox was a kung.fu master

794
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,904
The black girl was a demolition expert

795
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,246
French fox's specialty was sex

796
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,748
What was your specialty?

797
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:18,779
Knives

798
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,720
Character l played, Raven NcCoy

799
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,793
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performaners

800
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,027
According to the show

801
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,257
she was the deadliest woman in the
world with a knife

802
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,859
and she knew a zillion old jokes

803
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,471
Her grandfather, and old vaudevillian
taught her

804
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,208
And if we would've got picked up

805
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,572
they would've worked in a gimmick
where every show

806
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,111
l would've told another joke

807
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,276
You know any of them old jokes?

808
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,748
Well, l only got the chance to say one

809
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,854
'cause we only did one show

810
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,353
Tell me

811
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,589
lt's corny

812
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,458
Don't be that way. Tell me

813
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,730
No. You wouldn't like it, and l'd be
embarrassed

814
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,554
You' be em

815
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,291
You told, like, 50 million people
and you can't tell me?

816
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,767
l promise l won't laugh

817
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,937
That's what l'm afraid of, Vince

818
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,242
That's not what l meant, and you know it

819
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,001
Well, now l'm definitely not gonna
tell you

820
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,803
Because it's been built up too much

821
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,136
What a gyp

822
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,748
Martin and Lewis

823
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,049
Vanilla Coke

824
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,798
Mmm. Yummy

825
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,026
You think l could have a sip of that?

826
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,665
Be my guest

827
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,571
l gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like

828
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,700
You can use my straw
l don't have cooties

829
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,511
Yeah, but maybe l do

830
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:50,873
Cooties, l can handle

831
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,581
All right

832
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,086
Goddamn, that's a pretty fucking good
milk shake

833
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,356
Told you

834
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,123
l don't know if it was worth $5.00
but it was pretty fucking good

835
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,665
Don't you hate that?

836
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:46,795
Hate what?

837
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,038
Uncomfortable silences

838
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:55,702
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak
about bullshit in order to be comfortable?

839
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,739
l don't know, but it's a good question

840
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,218
That's when you know you've found
somebody really special

841
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:09,125
when you can just shut the fuck up for a
minute and comfortably share a silence

842
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,816
Well, l don't think we're quite there yet

843
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,996
but don't feel bad
We just met each other

844
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,362
l'll tell you what

845
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,031
l'm going to go to the bathroom and
powder my nose

846
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:24,770
You sit here and think of something
to say

847
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:32,009
.l'll do that .OK

848
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,509
l said goddamn!

849
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,143
Goddamn

850
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,007
Goddamn

851
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,550
l need some hair spray

852
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:18,352
Mmm. Don't you just love it when you
come back from the bathroom

853
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,154
to find your food waiting for you?

854
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,629
We're lucky we got anything at all

855
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,733
l don't think buddy Holly's much of
a waiter

856
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,104
Maybe we should've sat in
s section

857
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:28,896
Would you like some coffee?

858
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,233
Which one? There's 2 Monroes

859
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,339
No, there's not

860
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,733
That is Marilyn Monroe

861
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,441
That is Mamie Van Doren

862
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,577
And l don't see Jayne Mansfield

863
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,412
She must have the night off
or something

864
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,777
Pretty smart

865
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,980
Yeah, l got my moments

866
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,957
So, did you think of something to say?

867
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,720
Actually, l did

868
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,122
However

869
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,257
You seem like a really nice person

870
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,397
and l...l don't want to offend you

871
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,702
This doesn't sound like the usual
mindless, boring

872
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,535
getting.to.know.you chitchat

873
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,409
This sounds like you actually have
something to say

874
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,979
Well, well, l do. l do

875
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,710
But you have to promise not to
be offended

876
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,581
No! No, no, no

877
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,484
You can't promise something like that

878
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,284
l have no idea what you're gonna
ask me

879
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,358
so you can go ahead and ask me what
you're gonna ask me

880
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,926
and my natural response could be
to get offended

881
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,255
Then, through no fault of my own

882
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,965
l would've broken my promise

883
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,460
Let's just forget it

884
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,930
That's an impossibility

885
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,697
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility

886
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:36,804
ls that a fact?

887
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:41,438
Besides, isn't it more exciting
when you don't have permission?

888
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,010
All right. All right

889
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,737
Well, here it goes

890
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,746
What did you, uh, think about what
happened to Antwan?

891
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:49,781
Who's Antwan?

892
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,512
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him

893
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,079
He fell out of a window

894
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,785
Mmm. Mmm. Well, that is one way
to say it

895
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,190
Another way to say it would be that
he was thrown out

896
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,825
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus

897
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,026
and yet even another way is to say

898
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,863
he was thrown of a window by Marsellus
because of you

899
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,538
ls that a fact?

900
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,574
No, no. lt's not a fact
lt's just what l heard

901
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,800
lt's just what l heard

902
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,210
Who told you?

903
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,740
They

904
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,374
They talk a lot, don't they?

905
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,980
They certainly do. They certainly do

906
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,123
Don't be shy, Vincent
What else did they say?

907
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,122
Well, l'm not...l'm not shy. Um

908
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,885
Did it involve the '"F'" word?

909
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,461
No. No, no, no

910
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,996
They just said that Antwan had given
you a foot massage

911
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:38,427
And?

912
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,195
And...and nothing. That's it

913
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,738
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky
Horror of a 4.story window

914
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,410
for giving me a foot massage?

915
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,772
And you believe that?

916
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,511
Well, l mean, at the time l was told
it sounded reasonable

917
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,814
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
4.story window

918
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,218
for massaging my feet seemed
reasonable?

919
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,358
No, it seemed excessive

920
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,186
but that doesn't mean it didn't happen

921
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:09,098
l mean, l understand that Marsellus is
very, very protective of you

922
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,230
A husband being protective of his wife
is one thing

923
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,327
A husband almost killing another man

924
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,530
for touching his wife's feet is
something else

925
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:19,702
But did it happen?

926
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,241
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine

927
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,913
was my hand when he shook it at
my wedding

928
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,212
Really?

929
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,617
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus

930
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,414
threw Tony out of that 4.story window
except Marsellus and Tony

931
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,581
But when you little scamps get together

932
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,349
you're worse than a sewing circle

933
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,356
Ladies and gentlemen

934
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,894
now the moment you've all been waiting
for

935
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:46,728
the world.famous Jack Rabbit Slim's
Twist Contest

936
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,905
This is where one lucky couple

937
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:58,309
will win this handsome trophy that
Marilyn here is holding

938
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,915
Now, who'll be our first contestants?

939
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:02,915
Right here!

940
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,419
Hey, all right!

941
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:06,153
l wanna dance

942
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

943
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,691
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

944
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,418
l do believe Marsellus...My husband
your boss

945
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,360
told you to take me out and do whatever
l wanted

946
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,898
Now l want to dance. l want to win

947
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,736
l want that trophy, so dance good

948
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:21,934
All right. You asked for it

949
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,138
Let's hear it for our first contestants

950
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,607
Let's meet out first contestants here
this evening

951
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,440
Young lady, what is your name?

952
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,310
Mrs. Mia Wallace

953
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,489
And how about your fella here?

954
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,417
Vincent Vega

955
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,456
All right. Let's see what you can do

956
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:44,355
Take it away!

957
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,186
Go for it!

958
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,724
All right!

959
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,148
lt was a teenage wedding

960
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,377
And the old folks wished them well

961
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,988
You could see that Pierre

962
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,126
Did truly love the Mademoiselle

963
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,859
And now the young Monsieur
and Madame

964
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,625
Have rung the chapel bell

965
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,498
'"C'est La Vie'" say the old folks

966
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,706
lt goes to show you never can tell

967
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,432
They furnished off an apartment

968
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,737
With a 2.room roebuck sale

969
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,447
The coolerator was crammed

970
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,880
With TV dinners and ginger ale

971
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,520
But when Pierre found work

972
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,986
The little money coming worked out well

973
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,889
'"C'est La Vie,'" say the old folks

974
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,086
lt goes to show you never can tell

975
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,957
They had a hi.fi phono

976
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,193
Boy, did they let it blast

977
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,166
700 little records

978
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,309
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

979
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,944
But when the sun went down

980
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,047
The rapid tempo of the music fell

981
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,484
'"C'est La Vie,'" say the old folks

982
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,883
lt goes to show you never can tell

983
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,875
They had a teenage wedding

984
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,075
And the old folks wished them well

985
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,012
You could see that Pierre

986
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,280
Did truly love the Mademoiselle

987
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,923
ls that what you call an uncomfortable
silence?

988
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,331
l don't know what you call that

989
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,092
Drinks. Music

990
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,234
l'm gonna take a piss

991
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,235
That's a little bit more information than
l needed, Vince, but go right ahead

992
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,258
Girl

993
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:03,920
Bow, bow, bow

994
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,461
You'll be a woman soon

995
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,302
l love you so much, can't count
all the ways

996
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,337
l'd die for you, girl, and all
they can say is

997
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,064
He's not your kind

998
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,702
They never get tired of putting me down

999
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,711
And l never know when l come around

1000
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,347
What l'm gonna find

1001
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,282
Don't let them make up your mind

1002
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,783
Don't you know, girl

1003
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,786
Bow, bow, bow

1004
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,621
You'll be a woman soon

1005
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,130
One drink and that's it

1006
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,996
Don't be rude. Drink your drink

1007
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,499
But do it quickly

1008
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,469
Say good night and go home

1009
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,699
Girl

1010
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:57,813
You'll be a woman soon

1011
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,274
Soon

1012
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,587
You'll need a woman

1013
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,287
l've been misunderstood for all of my life

1014
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,616
But what they're saying, girl

1015
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:11,588
Just cuts like a knife

1016
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,829
The boy's no good

1017
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,789
Well, l finally have found what l've been
looking for

1018
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,833
But if they get a chance, they'll end it
for sure

1019
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,570
Sure they would

1020
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:25,840
Baby, l've done

1021
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,068
You see, this is a moral test of oneself

1022
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,248
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty

1023
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,748
because being loyal is very important

1024
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,443
They never get tired of putting me down

1025
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,554
And l never know when l come around

1026
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,158
What l'm gonna find

1027
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,693
Don't let them make up your mind

1028
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,358
Don't you know, girl

1029
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:56,804
You'll be a woman soon

1030
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,903
Please

1031
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:04,307
Come take my hand

1032
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,508
Girl

1033
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:13,421
You'll be a woman soon

1034
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,925
Please

1035
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,622
Come take my hand

1036
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:22,827
Hello

1037
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,364
Girl

1038
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,767
So, you're gonna go out there
you're gonna say

1039
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,768
'"Good night, l've had a very
lovely evening'"

1040
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,338
Walk out the door an get in the car

1041
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,212
Go home, jerk off, and that's all you're
gonna do

1042
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,343
Now it's up you, girl

1043
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,721
You'll be a woman soon

1044
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,795
Please

1045
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:58,396
Come take my hand

1046
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,534
You'll be a woman soon

1047
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,837
Soon

1048
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:15,782
You'll need a man

1049
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,392
All right, Mia

1050
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,960
So, listen, l gotta go

1051
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,691
All right?

1052
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,334
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ

1053
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,736
You F...Oh, Jesus Christ

1054
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,070
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

1055
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,770
Oh, come on, girl
We're getting out of here

1056
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,039
We gonna walk now

1057
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,654
Don't fucking die on me, Mia

1058
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,421
Silly fuck

1059
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,865
Answer!

1060
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,839
Have you got the ring?

1061
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,033
Why, certainly

1062
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,371
Join hands, you two love birds

1063
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,046
Please. Please. Hurry up

1064
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,580
Yes, yes, yes, indeed

1065
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,479
Hold hands, you love birds

1066
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,916
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

1067
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,857
Now, what do you say?

1068
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,433
l give up, l'll marry you!

1069
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,203
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

1070
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,905
l can hear it

1071
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,445
l thought you told those fucking assholes
never to call here this late

1072
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:53,775
Yeah, l told them

1073
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,212
and that is exactly what l'm going to tell
this fucking asshole right now

1074
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,154
l'll teach you a thing or two

1075
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:01,655
Don't you dare strike me!

1076
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,391
.Hello? .Lance, Vincent

1077
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,819
l'm in big fucking trouble, man

1078
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,894
l'm coming to your house

1079
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,391
Whoa, whoa. Hold your horses, man

1080
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,058
W...what's the problem?

1081
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,169
l got this chick, she's fucking O.D.ing
on me

1082
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,360
Well, don't bring her here

1083
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,172
l'm not even fucking joking with you
man

1084
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,705
Don't not be bringing some fucked.up
pooh.butt to my house

1085
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,568
No choice

1086
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,108
She's O.D.ing?

1087
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,007
She's fucking dying on me, man!

1088
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,212
OK, well, then you bite the fucking bullet

1089
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,408
and you take her to a hospital and
call a lawyer

1090
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:30,210
Negative

1091
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,081
This is not my fucking problem, man!

1092
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,688
You fucked her up, you fucking deal
with this!

1093
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,187
Are...are you talking to me on a
cellular phone?

1094
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,658
l don't know you. Who is this?

1095
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,297
Don't come here. l'm hanging up
the phone

1096
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,591
Prank caller! Prank caller!

1097
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,669
What the hell was that?!

1098
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,815
Have you lost your fucking mind?!

1099
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,573
You were talking about drug shit on
a cellular ph

1100
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:02,749
Lance, help me

1101
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,077
You crashed your car into my
fucking house!

1102
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,079
Grab her feet

1103
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,620
Hey, hey, hey! Are you deaf?

1104
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,020
You are not bringing this fucked.up
bitch into my house!

1105
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:11,752
This fucked.up.bitch is
Marsellus Wallace's wife

1106
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,485
Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
Do you?

1107
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,262
Yeah

1108
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,329
lf she croaks on me
l'm a fucking grease spot!

1109
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:20,897
Now, look, l will be forced to tell him
that you did not help

1110
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,900
and that you let her die on your
fucking lawn

1111
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,131
Now, come on, help me. Help me
Pick her up

1112
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,037
Shit!

1113
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,904
Lance!

1114
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,515
Shit!

1115
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,585
lt's 1 :30 in the goddamn morning

1116
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,687
What the fuck's going on out here?

1117
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:42,747
Who's she?

1118
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,927
Look, go in the fridge and get the thing
with that adrenaline shot

1119
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,161
What's wrong with her?

1120
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,159
She's O.D.ing!

1121
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,296
Well, get her the hell out of here!

1122
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,191
Get the shot!

1123
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,694
Fuck you! Fuck you, too!

1124
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:54,260
What a fucking bitch

1125
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,563
Look, you just keep talking to her
all right?

1126
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:56,500
She's getting the shot

1127
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,230
l'm gonna go get my little black
medical book

1128
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,736
What the fuck you need a medical book
for?

1129
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:00,374
To tell me what to do

1130
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,301
l never had to give an adrenaline shot
before

1131
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,510
You've never given an adrenaline shot?

1132
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,746
Well, l never had to, all right?

1133
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,380
l don't go joypopping with a bunch of
bubblegummers

1134
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:06,480
My friends can handle their highs

1135
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:07,307
Get the shot!

1136
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,414
Look, l am if you'll let me

1137
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,716
l ain't fucking stopping you!

1138
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,480
Well, stop talking to me
Start talking to her!

1139
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,053
.Get the shot! .All right!

1140
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,020
Hurry up, Lance! We're losing her!

1141
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,685
l'm looking as fast as l can!

1142
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,760
What's he looking for?

1143
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,092
l don't know. Some book

1144
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,459
What are you looking for?

1145
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,034
My little black medical book!

1146
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,232
What are you looking for?

1147
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,030
A little black fucking medical book!

1148
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,435
lt's like a textbook they give to nurses

1149
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,473
l never saw no medical book

1150
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,041
Well, trust me, l have one

1151
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,179
Well, if it's so important, why don't you
keep it with the shot?

1152
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,871
l don't know! Stop bothering me!

1153
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,107
Listen, while you're looking for it

1154
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,784
that gilr's gonna die on our carpet

1155
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:43,918
You're never gonna find anything in here

1156
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,245
Honey, l'm going to fucking kill you
if you don't shut up!

1157
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:46,282
...clean this shit up!

1158
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,088
Get in here!

1159
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,226
Christ

1160
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,585
Get the fuck out of my way

1161
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:52,956
Pig

1162
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,323
Quit fucking around and give her
the shot

1163
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,429
.Come on .OK

1164
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,726
Look, while l'm doing this, you take off
her shirt and find her heart

1165
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,666
Does it got to be exact?

1166
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:01,802
Yeah, it's got to be exact

1167
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,836
l'm giving her a shot in the heart
so l guess it's got to be fucking exact

1168
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,007
l don't know exactly where her heart is

1169
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,207
l mean, l think it's right here

1170
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:06,908
That's it

1171
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,041
This is? All right

1172
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,109
What l need is a big fat magic marker

1173
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,274
.You got it? .What?

1174
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,280
A magic marker! A felt pen!

1175
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,214
A fucking black magic marker!

1176
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:18,215
All right. All right

1177
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:19,115
Come on, man. Hurry up

1178
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,281
Fuck. Ok, ok, ok

1179
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:23,355
l think it's ready

1180
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,420
Hurry up, man. Hurry up

1181
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,426
Here, l'll tell you what to do

1182
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,826
No, no, no. Man, man, l ain't giving

1183
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:30,827
You're gonna give her the shot

1184
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:31,591
No, you're gonna give her the shot

1185
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:32,265
l ain't giving her the shot

1186
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:33,561
l never done this before

1187
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,792
l ain't never done it before, either
all right?

1188
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,734
l ain't starting now. Look, you brought
her here

1189
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,099
and that means that you're gonna give
her the shot

1190
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:39,363
The day that l bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house

1191
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,042
then l give her the shot
Give her the shot

1192
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,141
.Give it to me .Here

1193
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,176
Give me that

1194
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,972
All right. Tell me what to do

1195
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,243
OK. You're giving her an injection
of adrenaline

1196
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,385
straight to her heart, but she's got
a breastplate

1197
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:52,688
You've got to pierce through that

1198
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,517
so what you gotta do is you gotta bring
the needle down in a stabbing motion

1199
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,090
l gotta...l gotta stab her 3 times?

1200
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:58,351
No! You don't gotta fucking stab her
3 times

1201
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,084
You just gotta stab her once

1202
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,592
but it's gotta be hard enough to get
through her breastplate into her heart

1203
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:02,991
All right? And then once you do that

1204
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,733
you press down on the plunger

1205
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,424
OK, then what happens?

1206
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,101
l'm kind of curious about that myself

1207
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,395
This ain't no fucking joke, man!

1208
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,502
.Am l gonna kill her?
.No, no!

1209
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,535
She's supposed to come out of it
like that

1210
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,799
lt's

1211
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,166
All right. Count to 3

1212
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,140
All right. Ready?

1213
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:15,936
1

1214
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,276
2

1215
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,091
3!

1216
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,212
lf you're all right, then say something

1217
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,474
Something

1218
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,883
Ha ha. That was fucking trippy

1219
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,118
Oh, man

1220
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,980
Mia. Mia

1221
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,513
What's

1222
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,384
What's your thoughts on... on

1223
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,150
on how to handle this?

1224
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,355
What's yours?

1225
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:48,098
Well, l'm of the opinion that if Marsellus
lived his whole life

1226
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,602
he don't need to know nothing about
this incident

1227
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,299
lf Marsellus knew about this incident

1228
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,569
l'd be in as much trouble as you

1229
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,777
l seriously doubt that

1230
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,909
l can keep a secret if you can

1231
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:05,513
Shake on it?

1232
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,423
Mum's the word?

1233
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,364
Cool

1234
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:17,330
Now, if you'll excuse me

1235
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,296
l'm gonna go home and have a
heart attack

1236
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,068
Vincent!

1237
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,439
Do you want to hear my Fox Force Five
joke?

1238
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:31,971
Sure

1239
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,974
Except that l think l'm still a little
too petrified to laugh

1240
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,313
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny

1241
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,018
But if you still wanna hear it, l'll tell it

1242
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,152
l can't wait

1243
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:44,750
OK

1244
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,861
3 tomatoes are walking down the street

1245
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:49,156
Papa tomato, mama tomato
and baby tomato

1246
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:54,129
Baby tomato starts lagging behind and
papa tomato gets really angry

1247
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:58,398
goes back and squishes him, and says
'"catch up'"

1248
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,371
Ketchup

1249
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,349
See you around

1250
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:35,572
Oh, that paddlefoot...He funny
silly dog.oot

1251
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,373
He think totem pole alive
Hee hee hee!em pole alive

1252
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,914
He arctic tenderfoot

1253
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,853
That totem pole been here forever

1254
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:46,955
Butch?

1255
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,851
Butch, stop watching TV a second

1256
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:52,784
Yeah?

1257
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,019
We got a special visitor

1258
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:02,902
Now...do you remember when l told you
your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp?

1259
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,634
Well...this here is Captain Koons

1260
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,102
He was in the P.O.W. camp with daddy

1261
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,313
Hello, little man

1262
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:21,251
Boy, l sure heard a bunch about you

1263
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,859
See, l was a good friend of your dad's

1264
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,789
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell
together

1265
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,296
Over 5 years

1266
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:32,560
Hopefully

1267
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,936
you'll never have to experience
this yourself

1268
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,733
but when 2 men are in a situation
like me and your Dad were

1269
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,136
for as long as we were

1270
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,837
you take on certain responsibilites
of the other

1271
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:52,180
lf it had been me who'd...not made it

1272
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,552
Major Coolidge would be talking right
now to my son...Jim

1273
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:58,719
But the way it turned out

1274
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,854
l'm talking to you... Butch

1275
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,500
l got something for ya

1276
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,910
This watch l got here

1277
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:20,278
was first purchased by your great.
grandfather during the first world war

1278
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:24,950
lt was bought in a little general store
in Knoxville, Tennessee

1279
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:28,846
Made by the first company to ever
make wristwatches

1280
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,685
Up till then, people just carried
pocket watches

1281
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,355
lt was bought by private doughboy
Erine Coolidge

1282
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,998
on the day he set sail for Paris

1283
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,496
This was your great.grandfather's
war watch

1284
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:43,503
and he wore it every day he was
in that war

1285
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,764
And when he'd done his duty

1286
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,669
he went home to your
great.grandmother

1287
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:49,409
took the watch off

1288
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,976
put it in an old coffee can

1289
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,241
and in that can it stayed till your
granddad, Dane Coolidge

1290
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,145
was called upon by his country

1291
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:00,579
to go overseas and fight the Germans
once again

1292
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,781
This time they called it World War ll

1293
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,362
Your great.grandfather gave this watch
to your granddad for good luck

1294
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,333
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
as good as his old man's

1295
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:16,561
Dane was a marine, and he was killed
along with all the other marines

1296
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,433
at the battle of Wake lsland

1297
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:21,508
You granddad was facing death

1298
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,603
He knew it

1299
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:28,643
None of those boys had any illusions
about ever leaving that lsland alive

1300
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,844
so, 3 days before the Japanese took
the lsland

1301
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,048
your granddad asked a gunner on an
air force transport

1302
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,815
name of Winocki

1303
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,690
a man he had never met before
in his life

1304
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,592
to deliver it to his infant son

1305
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:46,528
who he had never seen in the flesh
his gold watch

1306
01:06:47,603 --> 01:06:49,764
3 days later, your granddad was dead

1307
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,803
but Winocki kept his word

1308
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,168
After the war was over

1309
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,411
he paid a visit to your grandmother

1310
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:00,606
delivering to your infant father his dad's
gold watch

1311
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,107
This watch

1312
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:10,984
This watch was on your daddy's wrist

1313
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,821
when he was shot down over Hanoi

1314
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,561
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese
prison camp

1315
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,726
He knew that if the gooks ever saw
the watch

1316
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:24,838
they'd confiscate it...take it away

1317
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,567
The way your dad looked at it

1318
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,971
this watch was your birthright

1319
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,578
He'd be damned if any slopes gonna
put their greasy yellow hands

1320
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,113
on his boy's birthright, so he hid it

1321
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,840
in one place he knew he could hide
something

1322
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,042
His ass

1323
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,548
5 long years he wore this watch up
his ass

1324
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,716
Then he died of dysentery
he give me the watch

1325
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,291
l hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal
up my ass, 2 years

1326
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:52,098
Then...after 7 years

1327
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,795
l was sent home to my family. And

1328
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,163
Now

1329
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:02,236
Little man, l give the watch to you

1330
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,627
lt's time, Butch

1331
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,148
...weighing 210 pounds

1332
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,054
Floyd Ray Wilson!

1333
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:51,317
lt's official

1334
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,186
lt's official. Wilson is dead!

1335
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:56,729
Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest
and hands down the most brutal fight

1336
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:57,523
this city has ever seen

1337
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,064
Coolidge was out of there faster than
l've ever seen a victorious boxer

1338
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:00,961
leave the ring

1339
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,297
Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?

1340
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,632
My guess would be yes, Richard

1341
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,205
l could see from my position here
the frenzy in his eyes

1342
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,899
give way to the realization of what
he was doing

1343
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,975
l think any man would have left
the ring that fast

1344
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,407
Dan, do you feel that this tragedy

1345
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:12,945
is gonna have an effect on the world
of boxing?

1346
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,139
Oh, Richard, a tragedy like this

1347
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,817
can't help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundations

1348
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:19,179
but paramount importance is during
the sad weeks ahead

1349
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:20,979
the eyes of the WBA remain

1350
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:57,922
Mia

1351
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,185
Marsellus?

1352
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,464
l didn't do it, man. l didn't do it

1353
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:04,599
How you doing?

1354
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:08,428
Great. l never thanked you for dinner

1355
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:11,935
What you got?

1356
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:12,666
He booked

1357
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:13,637
His trainer?

1358
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,106
Says he don't know nothing
l believe him

1359
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,178
Think Butch surprised his ass same
as us

1360
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,815
No, we don't wanna think
we wanna know

1361
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,209
Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on
his ass

1362
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:26,081
We'll find out for goddamn sure what
he knows and what he don't

1363
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,815
Butch's search...how do you
want it done?

1364
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,151
l'm prepared to scour the earth for
that motherfucker

1365
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,621
lf Butch goes to lndochina

1366
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,590
l want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice

1367
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,491
ready to pop a cap in his ass

1368
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,826
l will take care of it

1369
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,046
Mister?

1370
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,111
.Hey, Mister? .What?

1371
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,020
You were in that fight?

1372
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,987
The fight on the radio

1373
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,418
You're the fighter?

1374
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:05,658
Now, what gave you that idea?

1375
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,959
No, ho, come on

1376
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:10,523
You're him

1377
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,933
l know you're him

1378
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,695
Tell me you're him

1379
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,404
l'm him

1380
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,075
You killed the other boxing man

1381
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,205
He's dead?

1382
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,948
The radio said he was dead

1383
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,181
Sorry about that, Floyd

1384
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,226
What does it feel like?

1385
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:40,927
What does what feel like?

1386
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,423
Killing a man

1387
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:48,865
Beating another man to death with
your bare hands

1388
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,100
Are you're a weirdo?

1389
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,264
No

1390
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:55,704
lt is a subject l have much interest in

1391
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:01,739
You are the first person l have ever met
who has killed somebody

1392
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,248
So

1393
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,814
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1394
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,516
l'll tell you what

1395
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,785
You give me one of them cigarettes
you got up there

1396
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:16,021
and l'll tell you all about it

1397
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:36,243
So

1398
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,543
Esmarelda

1399
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,153
Villalobos

1400
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,117
ls that Mexican?

1401
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:46,226
The name is Spanish
but l am Colombian

1402
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,157
That's some handle you got there
honey

1403
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,319
Thank you

1404
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:51,991
And what is your name?

1405
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,230
.Butch .Butch

1406
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,472
What does it mean?

1407
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,903
l'm an American, honey. Our names
don't mean shit

1408
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:05,508
So, moving right along, Esmarelda

1409
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:07,078
What is it your wanna know?

1410
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,578
l want to know what it feels like to
kill a man

1411
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:12,718
l couldn't tell ya

1412
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,225
l didn't know he was dead until you
told me he was dead

1413
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,297
Now that l know he's dead

1414
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,297
you wanna know how l feel about it?

1415
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,106
l don't feel the least bit bad about it

1416
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,180
What the fuck l tell ya, huh?

1417
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,015
As soon as the word got out the fix
was in, man

1418
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,656
the odds went through the roof

1419
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,292
l know. l know. Unbelievable

1420
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:55,692
Hey, fuck him, Scotty

1421
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,593
lf he was a better boxer
he'd still be alive

1422
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,225
He never laced up his gloves

1423
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,164
which he never shoulda done in the first
fucking place

1424
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,426
he'd still be alive

1425
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,537
Yeah, well

1426
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:07,808
Who gives a fuck? lt's over now

1427
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,004
Yeah, well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Flyod

1428
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,704
let's talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch

1429
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,845
How many bookies you lay it around on?

1430
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,147
All 8?

1431
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:20,886
How long to collect?

1432
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,086
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?

1433
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,293
No, l understand, a few stragglers aside

1434
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:30,298
Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news
that is great news, man

1435
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,232
Yeah, mm.hmm

1436
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,493
No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave
in the morning

1437
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,832
Yeah, it'll probably take us a couple of
days to get down to Knoxville

1438
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,635
OK, my brother

1439
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,842
You're right. You're goddamn right

1440
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,878
All right, Scotty

1441
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,039
Next time l see you, we'll be on
Tennessee time

1442
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,246
Be cool, brother

1443
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,695
$45.60

1444
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:16,571
And, uh, here's little...something
for the effort

1445
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:17,473
Now

1446
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,178
lf anybody asks you who your fare
was tonight

1447
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,347
what are you gonna say?

1448
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,575
The truth

1449
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,617
3 well.dressed, slightly toasted
Mexicans

1450
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,087
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villalobos

1451
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,659
Buenas Noches, Butch

1452
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,943
Keep the light off

1453
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,278
ls that better, sugar pop?

1454
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,311
Oui

1455
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,511
Hard day at the office?

1456
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,788
Pretty hard

1457
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,882
l got in a fight

1458
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,454
Poor baby

1459
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,190
Can we make spoons?

1460
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:09,621
You know what?

1461
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:10,957
l was thinking about taking a shower

1462
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,632
l'm stinking like a dog over here

1463
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,895
Mmm. l like the way you stink

1464
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,005
Let me take this jacket off

1465
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,006
l was looking at myself in the mirrow

1466
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,070
l wish l had a pot

1467
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,708
You were looking at yourself in the
mirror, and you wish you had some pot?

1468
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:31,943
A pot

1469
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:33,818
A pot belly

1470
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,184
Pot bellies are sexy

1471
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,660
Well, you should be happy

1472
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,229
'cause you have one

1473
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,954
Shut up, Fatso!

1474
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:44,598
l don't have a pot

1475
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,399
l have a bit of a tummy

1476
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,569
like Madonna when she did Lucky Star

1477
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,135
lt's not the same thing

1478
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,406
l didn't know there was such a difference
between a pot belly and a tummy

1479
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,475
The difference is huge

1480
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,239
Would you like it if l had a pot belly?

1481
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:06,044
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish or like a gorilla

1482
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:09,453
But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy

1483
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,389
The rest of you is normal

1484
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:15,791
Normal face, normal legs, normal hips
normal ass

1485
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:19,832
but with a big perfectly round pot belly

1486
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:24,161
lf l had one, l'd wear a t.shirt 2 sizes
too small to accentuate it

1487
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,669
You think men would find that attractive?

1488
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,833
l don't give a damn what men
find attractive

1489
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,606
lt's unfortunate what we find pleasing
to the touch

1490
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,612
and pleasing to the eye is seldom
the same

1491
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,088
lf you had a pot belly

1492
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,147
l would punch you in it

1493
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,622
You'd punch me in my belly?

1494
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:45,622
Right in the belly

1495
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,125
Ah! l'd smother you

1496
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,130
l'd drop it right on your face till you
couldn't breathe

1497
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:55,460
.You'd do that? .Yes. Yes

1498
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:11,946
Did you get everything?

1499
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,086
Yes, l did

1500
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:14,846
Good job, sugar pop

1501
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,915
Did everything go as planned?

1502
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,051
You didn't listen to the...ow!

1503
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,589
You didn't listen to the radio?

1504
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:23,321
l never listen to your fights

1505
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:25,191
Were you the winner?

1506
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:26,996
l won, all right

1507
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,269
.Are you still retiring?
.Sure am

1508
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,969
So, it all worked out in the finish?

1509
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,935
We're not at the finish yet, baby. Mmm

1510
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:47,953
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1511
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,118
lf they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?

1512
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,921
But they won't find us, will they?

1513
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,100
Do you still want me to go with you?

1514
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,132
l don't want to be a burden or
a nuisance

1515
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,365
it's

1516
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,482
Say it

1517
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,054
Fabienne

1518
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,646
l want you to be with me

1519
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,852
.Forever? .Forever and ever

1520
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,227
Do you love me?

1521
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:34,996
.Very, very much .Mmm

1522
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,374
.Butch? .Yes

1523
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,406
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1524
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,349
Will you kiss it?

1525
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,219
But you first

1526
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,522
.OK .OK

1527
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,266
Butch

1528
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,247
l think l cracked a rib

1529
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,383
Giving me oral pleasure?

1530
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,221
No, retard. From the fight

1531
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:34,453
Don't call me retard

1532
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,426
My name is Fabby

1533
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,590
.My name is Fabienne
.Stop it. Stop it

1534
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:40,665
My name is Fabienne

1535
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:41,766
Shut up, fuckhead!

1536
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,801
l hate that Mongoloid voice

1537
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:46,667
OK, OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry

1538
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,037
l take it back

1539
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,415
Would you hand me a dry towel
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1540
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,142
Oh, l like that

1541
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,048
l like being called a tulip

1542
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:01,313
Tulip is much better than Mongoloid

1543
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,123
l didn't call you a Mongoloid

1544
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,919
l called you a retard, and l took it back

1545
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,328
Butch?

1546
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:10,826
Yes, lemon pie

1547
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,800
Where are we going to go?

1548
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:14,231
Well, l'm not sure yet

1549
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,362
Wherever you want

1550
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,102
We're gonna get a lot of money
from this

1551
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:21,242
but it ain't gonna be the kinda money

1552
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:24,742
that we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever

1553
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,241
l was thinking maybe we could go down

1554
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,483
someplace in the South Pacific

1555
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:30,950
The kinda money we're gonna have

1556
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,086
is gonna carry us a long way down there

1557
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,847
lf we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?

1558
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,047
You betcha

1559
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,020
And if after a while you didn't dig that

1560
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:42,026
go someplace else, maybe Tahiti
Mexico

1561
01:21:42,264 --> 01:21:43,959
But l do not speak Spanish

1562
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,657
Well, you do not speak Bora Boran
either

1563
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,065
Besides, Mexican is easy

1564
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,164
What does that mean?

1565
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,068
Where is the shoe store?

1566
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:56,268
Spit, please

1567
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,582
Excellent pronounciation. Mmm

1568
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,946
You'll be my little Mamacita in no time

1569
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,616
.What time is it?
.What time is it?

1570
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:13,051
Time for bed

1571
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,156
Sweet dreams, jellybean

1572
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:25,104
Butch?

1573
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,274
Never mind

1574
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:45,819
Merde. You startled me

1575
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,592
Did you have a bad dream?

1576
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,163
Shit

1577
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,536
What is this you're watching?

1578
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,433
A motorcycle movie

1579
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,872
l'm not sure the name

1580
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,440
Are you watching it?

1581
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,375
ln a way

1582
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:14,154
lt's a little early in the morning for
explosions and war

1583
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:19,184
What was it about?

1584
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:20,292
How should l know, Fabrienne?

1585
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,790
You were the one who was watching it

1586
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:24,597
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

1587
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,833
l don't know. l don't remember

1588
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,004
lt's really rare that l remember
my dreams

1589
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:34,039
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning

1590
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,403
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast?

1591
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,208
One more kiss, and l'll get up. Mmm

1592
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:47,353
.Satisfied? .Yep

1593
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:51,518
Then get up, lazy bones

1594
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,829
God. Unh

1595
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:56,630
What time is it?

1596
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,893
Almost 9:00 in the morning

1597
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,025
What time does our train arrive?

1598
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,434
1 1 :00

1599
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,033
You know what l'm gonna have for
breakfast?

1600
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,264
What, lemon pie?

1601
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:13,172
l'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry
pancakes with maple syrup

1602
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,173
Eggs over easy, and 5 sausages

1603
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:19,286
Anything to drink with that?

1604
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,917
Ah, that looks nice

1605
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:28,823
To drink, a tall glass of orange juice and
a black cup of coffee

1606
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,464
After that, l'm going to have a slice
of pie

1607
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,391
Pie for breakfast?

1608
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:37,166
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie

1609
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,937
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes

1610
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:43,837
And on top, a thin slice of melted
cheese

1611
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,068
Where's my watch?

1612
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:53,648
.lt's there .No, it's not

1613
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:56,820
.Have you looked?
.Yes, l fucking looked

1614
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,322
What the fuck do you think l'm doing?

1615
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:00,817
You sure you got it?

1616
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,128
Yes. Bedside table drawer

1617
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:05,357
On the little kangaroo?

1618
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,434
Yes. lt was on the little kangaroo

1619
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,536
Yeah, well, it's not here now

1620
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:12,934
Well, it should be

1621
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:16,238
Yes, it most definitely should be
but it's not here now

1622
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:17,570
So where the fuck is it?

1623
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:26,418
Fabienne, that was my father's
fucking watch

1624
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:31,724
Do you have any idea of what he had to
go through to get me that watch?

1625
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,590
l don't have time to go into it, but he
went through a lot

1626
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,286
Now, all this other shit you could
set on fire

1627
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:40,797
but l specifically reminded you not to
forget the fucking watch

1628
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:42,625
Now think

1629
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:45,971
.Did you get it? .l believe so

1630
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,572
You believe so? What the fuck does
that mean?

1631
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:49,402
You either did, or you didn't get it!

1632
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:52,304
Then l did

1633
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:55,707
Are you sure?

1634
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,015
No

1635
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:04,124
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucker!

1636
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:05,323
Motherfucker!

1637
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,861
Do you know how fucking stupid
you fucking are?

1638
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,087
No!

1639
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,234
lt's not your fault

1640
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,367
lf you left it at the apartment

1641
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,978
if you left it at the apartment
it's not your fault

1642
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,920
l had you bring a bunch of stuff

1643
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,657
l reminded you about it

1644
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:45,697
but l didn't illustrate how personal
the watch was to me

1645
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,863
lf all l give a fuck about was the watch

1646
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:50,798
l should've told you that

1647
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:55,107
You're not a mind reader, are you?

1648
01:27:06,087 --> 01:27:09,113
.l...l'm sorry .Don't be

1649
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,648
lt just means l can't have breakfast
with you

1650
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:14,384
Why does it mean that?

1651
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:20,496
Because l got to go back to my
apartment and get my watch

1652
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,160
Won't the gangsters be looking
for you there?

1653
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,033
Well...that's what l'm gonna to find out

1654
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,403
lf they are and l don't think l can
handle it

1655
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:32,577
Then l'll split

1656
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,749
l saw your watch. l thought l brought it

1657
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:37,779
l'm so sorry

1658
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:45,117
Here's some money

1659
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,520
Go out and get those pancakes
Have a nice breakfast

1660
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:50,990
l'll take your Honda. l'll be back before
you can say blueberry pie

1661
01:27:51,165 --> 01:27:52,189
Blueberry pie

1662
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:58,305
Maybe not that fast, but pretty fast, OK?

1663
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,337
.Bye .Bye

1664
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,305
Shit! Of all the fucking things she could
fucking forget

1665
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,410
she forgets my father's watch!

1666
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,545
l specifically reminded her

1667
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,412
Bedside table, on the kangaroo

1668
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:14,214
l said the words, '"Don't forget my
father's watch'"

1669
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,445
Looking good, Butch

1670
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,022
Flowers on the wall

1671
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:56,388
That don't bother me at all

1672
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,223
Playing solitaire till dawn

1673
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,868
With a deck of 51

1674
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:04,504
That's how you're going to beat them
Butch

1675
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,373
They keep underestimating you

1676
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,671
Kangeroo

1677
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,342
Now, don't tell me

1678
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,410
Counting flowers on the wall

1679
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:18,051
That don't bother me at all

1680
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:19,949
Playing

1681
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:21,654
Solitaire till dawn

1682
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:24,548
With a deck of 51

1683
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,958
Smoking cigarettes

1684
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:30,188
And watching Captain Kangaroo

1685
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:32,457
Now, don't tell me

1686
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,530

1687

Motherfucker

01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:54,750
He's dead

1691
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:55,781
Oh, my God

1692
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:56,990
He's dead

1693
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:08,726
lf you need someone to go to court

1694
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:09,835
l will be glad to help, OK?

1695
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:11,071
That guy was a drunken maniac

1696
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:12,967
He hit you, and then he crashed
into that car

1697
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:16,135
.Who? .Him

1698
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,871

Can l help you with something?

1701
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:05,254
Shut the fuck up

1702
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:08,828
Now you just wait a goddamn minute
now

1703
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,594
What the fuck are you up to?

1704
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:12,558
Come here, motherfucker!

1705
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,433
You feel that sting, big boy, huh?

1706
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,471
That's pride fucking with you, see?

1707
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:20,765
You got to fight through that shit

1708
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:23,972
You better kill me

1709
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:25,373
Yeah, somebody's going to get killed

1710
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,540
Somebody's going to get their
motherfucking head blown to

1711
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:30,877
Hold it right there, God damn it

1712
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:32,643
This ain't none of your business, mister

1713
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,343
l'm making it my business

1714
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:36,220
Toss the weapon

1715
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:37,822
You don't understand, man

1716
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:39,151
Toss the weapon

1717
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:47,991
Take your foot off the nigger

1718
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:49,796
Put your hands behind your head

1719
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:52,233
Approach the counter right now

1720
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:54,938
This motherfucker's trying to kill me

1721
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:56,434
Shut up

1722
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:59,170
Keep a..coming. Come on

1723
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:25,964
Zed, it's Maynard

1724
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:29,699
Yeah. The spider just caught
a couple flies

1725
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:21,727
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed

1726
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:26,889
That's Zed

1727
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,206
l thought you said you waited for me

1728
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:43,111
l did

1729
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:50,655
So how come they're all beat up?

1730
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:53,619
They did that to each other, man

1731
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:54,885
They came in fighting

1732
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,495
Now, this one right here

1733
01:38:58,065 --> 01:38:59,589
he was going to shoot that one

1734
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,067
ls that right?

1735
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:03,002
You going to shoot him, boy?

1736
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:10,035
Hey, is Grace all right out front?

1737
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:12,870
Yeah. lt ain't Tuesday, is it?

1738
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,308
No, it's Thursday

1739
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:15,876
She ought to be fine

1740
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:22,749
Ahh. Well...bring out the gimp

1741
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,418
l think the gimp's sleeping

1742
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:29,494
Well, l guess you'll just have to go
wake him up, now, won't you?

1743
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:11,094
Get up

1744
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:26,150
Get down

1745
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:39,064
Which one of them you want to do first?

1746
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:42,996
l ain't for sure yet

1747
01:40:47,141 --> 01:40:52,044
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

1748
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:55,773
Catch a nigger by the toe

1749
01:40:55,983 --> 01:40:59,544
lf he hollers, let him go

1750
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:04,423
Eenie, meenie...minie, mo

1751
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:19,303
My mother said to pick the perfect one
and you are...it

1752
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:23,007
l guess that means you, big boy

1753
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:30,411
You want to do it in here?

1754
01:41:30,617 --> 01:41:33,586
No. Let's do it back there in Russell's
old room

1755
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,787
Sounds good to me

1756
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:01,577
You keep an eye on this one

1757
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:25,028
Yeah!

1758
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:33,808
Yeah! Go!

1759
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,614
Come on, motherfucker!

1760
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:16,388
Yee...Haw!

1761
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:23,525
Come on, motherfucker!

1762
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:52,650
Shut the fuck up!

1763
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:58,082
Fuck!

1764
01:45:01,228 --> 01:45:02,286
Come on!

1765
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:42,699
You want that gun, don't you, Zed?

1766
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:49,175
Go ahead and pick it up

1767
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:53,206

Come on, honey!

1817

Where did you get this motorcycle?

Come on, let's go

You're hurt?

1825
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:37,720

You were gone so long l started to think
dreadful thoughts

1834
01:50:55,882 --> 01:50:57,713
Oh, l'm sorry, sweetie. l didn't mean
to worry you

1835
01:50:57,917 --> 01:50:59,111
Everything's fine
How was your breakfast?

1836
01:50:59,352 --> 01:50:59,784
lt was good

1837
01:50:59,986 --> 01:51:01,851
Did you get the pancakes?
The blueberry pancakes?

1838
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:02,918
They didn't have blueberry pancakes

1839
01:51:03,089 --> 01:51:03,851
l had to get buttermilk

1840
01:51:04,124 --> 01:51:05,284
Are you sure you're OK?

1841
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:07,152
Honey, since l left you it has

1842
01:51:07,427 --> 01:51:08,086
this has been without a doubt

1843
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:10,226
the single weirdest fucking day
of my life

1844
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:11,897
Come one, hop on. l'll tell you all about it

1845
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:12,996
Come on, get on

1846
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:14,566
Gotta go, gotta go. Come on

1847
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:17,531
Whose motorcycle is this?

1848
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:18,736
lt's a chopper, baby

1849
01:51:18,872 --> 01:51:19,839
Whose chopper is this?

1850
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:21,066
Zed's

1851
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:22,205
Who's Zed?

1852
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:23,908
Zed's dead, baby

1853
01:51:24,477 --> 01:51:25,535
Zed's dead

1854
01:51:41,594 --> 01:51:44,427
Yes, you did, Brett! You tried to fuck him

1855
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:45,387
No

1856
01:51:45,532 --> 01:51:49,992
And Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace

1857
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,465
Oh, God, please. l don't want to die

1858
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:54,367
.You read the bible, Brett?
.Y...Yes!

1859
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,642
Well, there's this passage
l got memorized

1860
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,275
lt sort of fits the ocassion

1861
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:01,237
Ezekiel, 25:17

1862
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:06,114
The path of the rightous man is beset
on all sides

1863
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:08,150
by the inequities of the selfish

1864
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:10,915
and the tyranny of evil men

1865
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:16,260
Blessed is he who in the name of
charity and good will

1866
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:19,364
shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness

1867
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,829
for he is truly his brother's keeper

1868
01:52:22,102 --> 01:52:24,969
and the finder of lost children

1869
01:52:25,105 --> 01:52:27,573
And l will strike down upon thee

1870
01:52:27,807 --> 01:52:31,265
with great vengeance and furious anger

1871
01:52:31,444 --> 01:52:35,744
those who attempt to poison and
destroy my brothers

1872
01:52:36,149 --> 01:52:39,550
And you will know my name is the Lord

1873
01:52:40,019 --> 01:52:43,318
when l lay my vengeance upon thee

1874
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:52,954
l'm fucked. l'm fucked

1875
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:53,995
l'm fucked

1876
01:52:54,134 --> 01:52:55,192
ls he a friend of yours?

1877
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:58,393
Hmm? Oh, Vincent, Marvin

1878
01:52:58,605 --> 01:52:59,230
Marvin, Vincent

1879
01:52:59,405 --> 01:53:00,269
Better tell him to shut the fuck up

1880
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:01,098
He's getting on my nerves

1881
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,865
Marvin. Marvin

1882
01:53:03,076 --> 01:53:04,043
Marvin!

1883
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:06,368
l'd knock that shit off if l was you

1884
01:53:07,147 --> 01:53:08,842
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1885
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,773
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1886
01:53:41,881 --> 01:53:43,007
Slip your mind?

1887
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:46,380
Did you forget that someone was in
there with a goddamn hand.cannon?

1888
01:53:46,586 --> 01:53:48,816
You see the size of that gun he fired
at us?

1889
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:50,046
lt was bigger than him

1890
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:57,760
We should be fucking dead, man

1891
01:53:58,598 --> 01:53:59,929
l know. He was lucky

1892
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:02,961
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck

1893
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:04,597
Yeah, maybe

1894
01:54:05,572 --> 01:54:07,506
This was divine intervention

1895
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,638
You know what divine intervention is?

1896
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:17,441
l think so

1897
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:20,952
That means that God came down from
Heaven and stopped the bullets

1898
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:23,452
That's right. That's exactly what it means

1899
01:54:23,656 --> 01:54:24,816
God came down from Heaven

1900
01:54:24,991 --> 01:54:26,822
and stopped these motherfucker bullets

1901
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:29,792
l think it's time for us to leave, Jules

1902
01:54:29,996 --> 01:54:32,294
Don't do that. Don't fucking blow this
shit off

1903
01:54:32,465 --> 01:54:34,456
What just happened here was
a fucking miracle

1904
01:54:34,734 --> 01:54:36,429
Chill, Jules. This shit happens

1905
01:54:36,603 --> 01:54:39,572
Wrong. Wrong. This shit doesn't
just happen

1906
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:43,172
Do you want to continue this theological
discussion in a car

1907
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:44,901
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1908
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:46,907
We should be fucking dead, my friend

1909
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:49,682
What happened here was a miracle

1910
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:52,248
and l want you to fucking acknowledge it

1911
01:54:52,418 --> 01:54:54,215
All right, it was a miracle

1912
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:56,480
Can we go now?

1913
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:05,527
Let's go, nigger. Come on

1914
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:07,364
Shit

1915
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:11,500
You ever seen that show cops?

1916
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:12,467
Well, l was watching it one time

1917
01:55:12,772 --> 01:55:13,796
and there was this cop on

1918
01:55:13,973 --> 01:55:17,739
and he was talking about this gunfight
he had in a hallway with this guy, right?

1919
01:55:17,944 --> 01:55:19,639
And he just unloaded on this guy

1920
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:21,746
and nothing happened
He didn't hit nothing

1921
01:55:21,948 --> 01:55:23,779
OK? lt was just him and this guy

1922
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:25,241
l mean, you know

1923
01:55:25,952 --> 01:55:28,011
lt's freaky, but it happens

1924
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:29,380
Look, you want to play blind man

1925
01:55:29,589 --> 01:55:30,613
go walk with the shepherd

1926
01:55:30,823 --> 01:55:32,882
but me, my eyes are wide fucking open

1927
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:34,523
What the fuck does that mean?

1928
01:55:35,028 --> 01:55:36,495
lt means that's it for me

1929
01:55:36,663 --> 01:55:38,722
From here on in, you can consider
my ass retired

1930
01:55:38,932 --> 01:55:40,490
.Jesus Christ
.Don't blaspheme

1931
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:42,134
.God damn it
.l said don't do that

1932
01:55:42,335 --> 01:55:44,166
You know, why are you fucking freaking
out on us?

1933
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:46,099
Look, l'm telling Marsellus today

1934
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:47,067
l'm through

1935
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:48,901
Well, why don't you tell him at the same
time why?

1936
01:55:49,075 --> 01:55:49,837
Don't worry. l will

1937
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:52,444
Yeah, and l'll bet you $10,000 he laughs
his ass off

1938
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:54,237
l don't give a damn if he does

1939
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:58,008
Tss. Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

1940
01:55:58,284 --> 01:55:59,945
Man, l don't even have an opinion

1941
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:01,711
Well, you got to have an opinion

1942
01:56:01,888 --> 01:56:04,379
l mean, do you think that God came
down from Heaven and stopped

1943
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:06,353
What the fuck's happening?

1944
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:07,485
Oh, shit, man!

1945
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:10,026
Oh, man, l shot Marvin in the face

1946
01:56:10,263 --> 01:56:11,287
Why the fuck did you do that?

1947
01:56:11,397 --> 01:56:12,887
Well, l didn't mean to do it
lt was an accident

1948
01:56:13,032 --> 01:56:15,398
Oh, man, l've seen some crazy.ass shit
in my time, but this

1949
01:56:15,568 --> 01:56:17,331
Chill out, man. l told you it was
an accident

1950
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:19,094
You probably...you went over a bump
or something

1951
01:56:19,339 --> 01:56:20,670
Hey, the car didn't hit no
motherfucking bump

1952
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:23,307
Hey, look, man, l didn't mean to shoot
the son of a bitch

1953
01:56:23,509 --> 01:56:24,601
The gun went off. l don't know why

1954
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:26,139
Well, look at this fucking mess, man!

1955
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:27,971
We're on a city street in broad daylight

1956
01:56:28,214 --> 01:56:28,737
l can't believe it, man

1957
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:30,006
Well, believe it now, motherfucker

1958
01:56:30,249 --> 01:56:31,477
We got to get this car off the road

1959
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:32,743
You know, cops tend to notice shit

1960
01:56:33,019 --> 01:56:34,008
like you're driving a car drenched
in fucking blood

1961
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,618
Just take it to a friendly place, that's all

1962
01:56:36,889 --> 01:56:37,719
This is the valley, Vincent

1963
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,117
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places

1964
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:41,293
Well, Jules, this ain't my fucking town
man!

1965
01:56:41,527 --> 01:56:43,722
.Shit! .What you doing?

1966
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,363
l'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake

1967
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:46,192
Where's Toluca Lake?

1968
01:56:46,432 --> 01:56:48,923
lt's just over the hill here
over by Burbank Studios

1969
01:56:49,602 --> 01:56:50,569
lf Jimmie's ass ain't home

1970
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:52,170
l don't know what the fuck we going
to do, Man

1971
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:54,363
because l ain't got no other patners
in 818

1972
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:57,603
Jimmie, yo, how you doing, man?
lt's Jules

1973
01:56:57,944 --> 01:56:58,876
Just listen up, man

1974
01:56:59,045 --> 01:57:01,070
Me and my homeboy are in some
serious fucking shit, man

1975
01:57:01,314 --> 01:57:03,077
We're in a car, and we got to get off
the road pronto

1976
01:57:03,316 --> 01:57:05,216
l need to use your garage for
a couple hours

1977
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:09,913
We got to be real fucking delicate with
this Jimmie situation, you know

1978
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:12,384
He's one remark away from kicking our
asses out the door

1979
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:13,650
lf he does, what do we do?

1980
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:16,055
Well, we ain't leaving until we made
a couple calls

1981
01:57:16,262 --> 01:57:17,729
but l don't want it to reach that pitch

1982
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:18,726
l mean, Jimmie's a friend

1983
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:19,829
You don't come into your friend's house

1984
01:57:20,066 --> 01:57:21,465
and start telling him what's what

1985
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:23,328
Yeah, well, just tell him not to be abusive
that's all

1986
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:26,300
l mean, he kind of freaked out back
there when he saw Marvin

1987
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:27,632
Well, put yourself in his position

1988
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:28,865
l mean, it's 8:00 in the morning

1989
01:57:29,075 --> 01:57:31,236
He just woke up. He wasn't expecting
this shit

1990
01:57:31,477 --> 01:57:34,071
l mean, shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor

1991
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,145
Well, if that favor means that l got to
take a shit

1992
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:38,109
then he can stick that favor straight up
his ass

1993
01:57:38,384 --> 01:57:38,975
l don't care

1994
01:57:39,152 --> 01:57:41,484
Hey, fuck, nigger. What the fuck did you
just do to his towel, man?

1995
01:57:41,654 --> 01:57:42,450
l was drying my hands

1996
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:43,814
Well, you're supposed to wash
them first

1997
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,115
Well, you watched me wash them

1998
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:46,482
l watched you get them wet

1999
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:47,556
l was washing them

2000
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:49,257
This shit's hard to get off

2001
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:51,124
Maybe if he had lava, l could've done
a better job

2002
01:57:51,297 --> 01:57:52,594
l used the same fucking soap you did

2003
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:55,595
and when l finished the towel didn't look
like no goddamn maxipad

2004
01:57:55,768 --> 01:57:56,735
Now, what if he was to come in here

2005
01:57:56,969 --> 01:57:58,266
and see this towel like this, Vincent?

2006
01:57:58,438 --> 01:58:01,999
lt's shit like this that's going to bring this
situation to a head, man

2007
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:04,698
Look

2008
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:07,241
l ain't threatening you with nothing
all right?

2009
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:09,039
You know l respect you and all

2010
01:58:09,248 --> 01:58:11,648
but just don't put me in this position
all right?

2011
01:58:11,784 --> 01:58:14,412
All right. Fine. Fine

2012
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:16,645
Ask me nice like that, no problem

2013
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,422
Just go handle your friend

2014
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,886
Go ahead. l don't care

2015
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:25,028
Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie

2016
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:27,222
This is some serious gourmet shit

2017
01:58:27,467 --> 01:58:28,934
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied

2018
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:31,730
with some freeze.dried taster's choice
right?

2019
01:58:31,971 --> 01:58:35,702
Heh! And he springs this serious
gourmet shit on us

2020
01:58:35,942 --> 01:58:36,806
What flavor is this?

2021
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:39,443
.Knock it off, Julie .What?

2022
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:42,376
l don't need you to tell me how fucking
good my coffee is, OK?

2023
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:44,675
l'm the one who buys it. l know how
good it is

2024
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:46,976
When Bonnie goes shopping
she buys shit

2025
01:58:47,353 --> 01:58:49,446
l buy the gourmet expensive stuff
because when l drink it

2026
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:50,486
l want to taste it

2027
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:52,385
But you know what's on my mind
right now?

2028
01:58:52,525 --> 01:58:54,550
lt ain't the coffee in my kitchen

2029
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,728
lt's the dead nigger in my garage

2030
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:58,330
Oh, Jimmie, don't even worry about it

2031
01:58:58,531 --> 01:58:59,555
No, no, no. l don't think about anything

2032
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:00,660
l want to ask you a question

2033
01:59:00,867 --> 01:59:02,198
When you came pulling in here

2034
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:03,768
did you notice a sign out in the front
of my house

2035
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:05,501
that said '"Dead Nigger Storage'"?

2036
01:59:05,671 --> 01:59:06,831
Jimmie, you know l didn't see no shit

2037
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,131
Did you notice a sign in the front
of my house

2038
01:59:09,308 --> 01:59:10,536
that said '"Dead Nigger Storage'"?

2039
01:59:11,777 --> 01:59:14,007
No. l didn't

2040
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,108
You know why you didn't see that sign?

2041
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:16,913
Why?

2042
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:18,845
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing
dead niggers

2043
01:59:19,152 --> 01:59:21,347
ain't my fucking business, that's why!

2044
01:59:21,587 --> 01:59:22,451
Jimmie, we're not going to store
the motherfucker

2045
01:59:22,622 --> 01:59:24,590
No. Don't you fucking realize, man

2046
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:26,155
that if Bonnie comes home

2047
01:59:26,392 --> 01:59:27,723
and finds a dead body in her house

2048
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:28,961
l'm going to get divorced?

2049
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:30,822
All right? No marriage counselor
no trial separation

2050
01:59:30,997 --> 01:59:32,726
l'm going to get fucking divorced, OK?

2051
01:59:32,965 --> 01:59:35,263
And l don't want to get fucking divorced

2052
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:38,300
Now, man, you know, fuck
l mean, l want to help you

2053
01:59:38,504 --> 01:59:40,938
but l don't want to lose my wife doing it
all right?

2054
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:42,801
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't going
to leave you

2055
01:59:42,975 --> 01:59:47,412
Don't fucking '"Jimmie'" me, Jules!
OK? Don't fucking '"Jimmie'" me

2056
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:48,841
There's nothing that you're gonna to say

2057
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:51,515
that's going to make me forget that
l love my wife, is there?

2058
01:59:53,886 --> 01:59:55,046
Look, you know

2059
01:59:55,321 --> 01:59:58,688
she comes home from work in about
an hour and a half

2060
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:01,760
graveyard shift at the hospital

2061
02:00:01,928 --> 02:00:03,725
You got to make some phone calls?

2062
02:00:03,896 --> 02:00:05,488
You got to call some people?

2063
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:09,259
Well, then do it, and then get the fuck
out of my house before she gets here

2064
02:00:09,602 --> 02:00:10,694
That's kook and the gang

2065
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:12,633
You know, we don't want to fuck your
shit up

2066
02:00:12,805 --> 02:00:13,533
All l want to do is call my people

2067
02:00:13,773 --> 02:00:15,240
get them to bring us in, that's all

2068
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:16,463
You don't want to fuck my shit up?

2069
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:18,108
You're fucking my shit up right now

2070
02:00:18,344 --> 02:00:20,642
You're going to fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home

2071
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:22,570
So just do me that favor, all right?

2072
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:24,909
The phone is in my bedroom
l suggest you get going

2073
02:00:25,484 --> 02:00:26,974
Well, say she comes home

2074
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:29,654
What do you think she'll do?

2075
02:00:32,024 --> 02:00:34,424
Oh, no fucking shit, she'll freak

2076
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,118
That ain't no kind of answer

2077
02:00:36,696 --> 02:00:37,958
l mean, you know, l don't

2078
02:00:38,197 --> 02:00:39,755
How much? A lot or a little?

2079
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:44,770
You got to appreciate what an explosive
element this Bonnie situation is

2080
02:00:45,037 --> 02:00:47,062
l mean, if she comes home from a hard
day's work

2081
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,232
and finds a bunch of gangsters in her
kitchen doing a bunch of gangster shit

2082
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:52,737
there ain't no telling what she's liable
to do

2083
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:58,182
Yeah, l've grasped that, Jules

2084
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:00,675
All l'm doing is contemplating the '"if'"s

2085
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,879
l don't want to hear about no
motherfucking '"if'"s

2086
02:01:03,122 --> 02:01:04,419
All l want to hear from your ass is

2087
02:01:04,657 --> 02:01:07,148
You ain't got no problem, Jules
l'm on the motherfucker

2088
02:01:07,326 --> 02:01:08,725
Go back in there, chill them niggers out

2089
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,795
and wait for the Cavalry
which should be coming directly

2090
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:14,299
You ain't got no problem, Jules

2091
02:01:15,268 --> 02:01:16,860
l'm on the motherfucker

2092
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:19,768
Go back in there and chill them
niggers out

2093
02:01:20,139 --> 02:01:22,505
and wait for the wolf, who should be
coming directly

2094
02:01:23,743 --> 02:01:25,005
You're sending the wolf?

2095
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:27,269
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?

2096
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:31,575
Shit, Negro, that's all you had to say

2097
02:01:33,085 --> 02:01:34,677
ls she the hysterical type?

2098
02:01:36,255 --> 02:01:40,453
When is she due? Mmm

2099
02:01:41,494 --> 02:01:43,291
Give me the principals' names again

2100
02:01:46,365 --> 02:01:49,892
Jules. Mm...hmm

2101
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:52,827
Vincent

2102
02:01:57,209 --> 02:01:58,198
Jimmie

2103
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:01,271
Bonnie

2104
02:02:01,747 --> 02:02:02,736
Mm...hmm

2105
02:02:06,986 --> 02:02:08,453
lt's 30 minutes away

2106
02:02:08,688 --> 02:02:09,985
l'll be there in 10

2107
02:02:27,673 --> 02:02:30,437
You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?

2108
02:02:30,609 --> 02:02:31,439
Sure is

2109
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,238
l'm Winston Wolf. l solve problems

2110
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:35,311
Good. We got one

2111
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:36,811
So l heard. May l come in?

2112
02:02:37,149 --> 02:02:38,207
Yeah, please do

2113
02:02:39,385 --> 02:02:42,980
You must be Jules, which would
make you Vincent

2114
02:02:43,289 --> 02:02:45,018
Let's get down to brass tacks
gentlemen

2115
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,215
lf l was informed correctly

2116
02:02:46,425 --> 02:02:47,983
the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?

2117
02:02:48,394 --> 02:02:49,258
100%

2118
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:53,125
Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30
in the a.m., is that correct?

2119
02:02:53,299 --> 02:02:54,095
Uh...huh

2120
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:57,028
l was led to believe if she comes home
and finds us here

2121
02:02:57,236 --> 02:02:58,897
she wouldn't appreciate it none
too much?

2122
02:02:59,238 --> 02:02:59,932
She wouldn't at that

2123
02:03:00,072 --> 02:03:03,405
All right, that gives us 40 minutes to get
the fuck out of dodge

2124
02:03:03,609 --> 02:03:06,407
which, if you do what l say when l say it
should be plenty

2125
02:03:06,612 --> 02:03:10,207
Now, you got a corpse in a car minus
a head in a garage

2126
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:11,247
Take me to it

2127
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:20,649
.Jimmie? .Uh.huh

2128
02:03:21,293 --> 02:03:22,692
Do me a favor, will you?

2129
02:03:22,928 --> 02:03:24,259
l thought l smelled some coffee
back there

2130
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:25,497
Would you make me a cup?

2131
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:28,060
Uh, yeah, sure

2132
02:03:30,002 --> 02:03:32,368
Oh, um, how do you take it?

2133
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:34,005
Lots of cream, lots of sugar

2134
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:39,201
About the car...is there anything l need
to know?

2135
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:41,505
Does it stall, does it smoke, does it
make a lot of noise?

2136
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:43,146
ls there gas in it? Anything?

2137
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:45,249
Aside from how it looks, the car is cool

2138
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:48,109
Positive? Don't get me out there
on the road

2139
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:49,753
l find out the brake lights don't work

2140
02:03:49,955 --> 02:03:52,446
Hey, man, far as l know
the motherfucker's tiptop

2141
02:03:53,459 --> 02:03:54,448
Good enough

2142
02:03:55,494 --> 02:03:56,791
Let's go back to the kitchen

2143
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:04,026
Here you go, Mr. Wolf

2144
02:04:04,203 --> 02:04:05,067
Thank you, Jimmie

2145
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:15,206
OK, first thing

2146
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:18,043
you two take the body
stick it in the trunk

2147
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,046
Now, Jimmie

2148
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:20,809
this looks to be a pretty domesticated
house

2149
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,146
that would lead me to believe that
in the garage

2150
02:04:22,388 --> 02:04:24,447
or under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleaners and cleansers and shit like that

2151
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,679
Yeah, Mr. Wolf. Under the sink

2152
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:27,688
Good. What l need you two fellas to do

2153
02:04:27,927 --> 02:04:30,293
is take those cleaning products and
clean the inside of the car

2154
02:04:30,529 --> 02:04:32,520
l'm talking fast, fast, fast

2155
02:04:32,731 --> 02:04:33,925
You need to go in the back seat

2156
02:04:34,099 --> 02:04:37,262
scoop up all those little pieces of brain
and skull

2157
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:38,265
Get it out of there

2158
02:04:38,471 --> 02:04:39,335
Wipe down the upholstery

2159
02:04:39,538 --> 02:04:40,402
Now, when it comes to upholstery

2160
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:41,765
it don't need to be spick.and.span

2161
02:04:41,974 --> 02:04:42,804
You don't need to eat off it

2162
02:04:43,008 --> 02:04:44,669
Just give it a good once over

2163
02:04:44,877 --> 02:04:47,607
What you need to take care of are
the really messy parts

2164
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:48,905
The pools of blood that have collected

2165
02:04:49,148 --> 02:04:50,775
you got to soak that shit up

2166
02:04:51,283 --> 02:04:52,011
Now, Jimmie

2167
02:04:52,451 --> 02:04:54,043
We need to raid your linen closet

2168
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:57,519
l need blankets. l need comforters
l need quilts. l need bedspreads

2169
02:04:57,723 --> 02:04:59,088
The thinker the better, the darker
the better

2170
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,986
No whites. Can't use them

2171
02:05:01,227 --> 02:05:03,092
We need to camouflage the interior
of the car

2172
02:05:03,395 --> 02:05:05,659
We're going to line the front seat and
the back seat and the floorboards

2173
02:05:06,098 --> 02:05:07,656
with quilts and blankets

2174
02:05:08,133 --> 02:05:10,795
So if a cop stops us and starts sticking
his big snout in the car

2175
02:05:11,036 --> 02:05:12,333
the subterfuge won't last

2176
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:14,471
but at a glance, the car will appear
to be normal

2177
02:05:15,407 --> 02:05:17,898
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work

2178
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:19,604
'"Please'" would be nice

2179
02:05:20,913 --> 02:05:21,709
Come again?

2180
02:05:22,014 --> 02:05:23,572
l said a '"please'" would be nice

2181
02:05:25,718 --> 02:05:26,582
Get it straight, buster

2182
02:05:26,785 --> 02:05:27,752
l'm not here to say '"please'"

2183
02:05:27,953 --> 02:05:29,250
l'm here to tell you what to do

2184
02:05:30,923 --> 02:05:33,084
And if self.preservation is an instinct
you posses

2185
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:35,419
you better fucking do it and do it quick

2186
02:05:36,729 --> 02:05:37,787
l'm here to help

2187
02:05:37,963 --> 02:05:40,261
lf my help is not appreciated
lots of luck, gentlemen

2188
02:05:40,466 --> 02:05:42,024
No, no, no, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that

2189
02:05:42,268 --> 02:05:43,326
Your help is definitely appreciated

2190
02:05:43,569 --> 02:05:44,934
Mr. Wolf, listen

2191
02:05:45,137 --> 02:05:47,469
l don't mean disrespect, OK?
l respect you

2192
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,006
l just don't like people barking orders
at me, that's all

2193
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,674
lf l'm curt with you, it's because time
is a factor

2194
02:05:53,012 --> 02:05:54,639
l think fast, l talk fast

2195
02:05:54,914 --> 02:05:56,040
and l need you guys to act fast

2196
02:05:56,248 --> 02:05:59,843
lf you want to get out this, so pretty
please with sugar on top

2197
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:01,211
clean the fucking car

2198
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:07,516
Don't be looking at me like that, all right?

2199
02:06:07,793 --> 02:06:08,817
l can feel your look

2200
02:06:12,464 --> 02:06:14,489
lt's a 197 4 Chevy Nova

2201
02:06:16,835 --> 02:06:17,767
Green

2202
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:22,269
Nothing except for the mess inside

2203
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:27,871
Mmm, about 20 minutes

2204
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:31,047
Nobody who'll be missed

2205
02:06:33,686 --> 02:06:35,085
You're a good man, Joe

2206
02:06:35,354 --> 02:06:36,378
Thanks a bunch

2207
02:06:37,756 --> 02:06:38,688
How we coming, Jimmie?

2208
02:06:38,891 --> 02:06:42,258
Pretty good. l got it all here, but, uh

2209
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,259
Mr. Wolf, you got to understand
something

2210
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:46,364
Winston, Jimmie, please. Winston

2211
02:06:46,565 --> 02:06:49,295
OK. You got to understand something
now, Winston

2212
02:06:50,102 --> 02:06:51,763
Uh, no, thank you

2213
02:06:52,004 --> 02:06:55,030
Uh, this is our best linen here

2214
02:06:55,274 --> 02:06:57,902
and it's a...it was a wedding present

2215
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:00,134
from my uncle Conrad and
my aunt Ginny

2216
02:07:00,379 --> 02:07:01,573
and they're not with us anymore

2217
02:07:01,747 --> 02:07:02,611
And l really want to help you guys out

2218
02:07:02,815 --> 02:07:06,148
Let me ask you a question, Jimmie
if you don't mind

2219
02:07:06,318 --> 02:07:07,717
No, no, please, please, go ahead

2220
02:07:09,788 --> 02:07:14,521
You uncle Conrad and aunt Ginny
were they millionaires?

2221
02:07:15,728 --> 02:07:16,592
No

2222
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:19,491
Well, you uncle Marsellus is

2223
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:23,666
and l'm positive if uncle Conrad
and aunt

2224
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:24,459
Ginny

2225
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:26,262
Ginny were here

2226
02:07:26,505 --> 02:07:30,168
they would furnished you with a whole
bedroom set

2227
02:07:30,709 --> 02:07:33,041
which your uncle Marsellus is more than
happy to do

2228
02:07:37,916 --> 02:07:39,042
l like oak myself

2229
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:41,879
That's what l have in my bedroom

2230
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,083
How about you, Jimmie?

2231
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:47,251
You an oak man?

2232
02:07:48,994 --> 02:07:50,086
Oak's nice

2233
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:58,666
Oh, man

2234
02:07:58,837 --> 02:08:00,668
l will never forgive your ass for this shit

2235
02:08:00,873 --> 02:08:02,738
This is some fucked.up repugnant shit

2236
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:04,374
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy

2237
02:08:04,576 --> 02:08:06,203
that once a man admits that he is wrong

2238
02:08:06,412 --> 02:08:08,710
that he is immediately forgiven for all
wrongdongs?

2239
02:08:08,914 --> 02:08:09,573
Have you ever heard that?

2240
02:08:09,782 --> 02:08:11,545
Get the fuck out my face with that shit

2241
02:08:11,784 --> 02:08:12,751
The motherfucker said that shit

2242
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:16,182
never had to pick up itty.bitty pieces of
skull on account of your dumb ass

2243
02:08:16,388 --> 02:08:17,218
l got a threshold, Jules

2244
02:08:17,489 --> 02:08:19,423
l got a threshold for the abuse that
l will take

2245
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:21,388
Now, right now, l'm a fucking race car
all right?

2246
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:22,684
And you got me in the red

2247
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:24,986
And l'm just saying...l'm just saying that
it's fucking dangerous

2248
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:27,392
to have a race car in the fucking red
that's all

2249
02:08:27,733 --> 02:08:28,461
l could blow

2250
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,658
Oh, oh, you ready to blow?

2251
02:08:29,868 --> 02:08:30,664
Yeah, l'm ready to blow

2252
02:08:30,869 --> 02:08:33,531
Well, l'm a mushroom cloud laying
motherfucker, motherfucker

2253
02:08:33,772 --> 02:08:35,205
Every time my fingers touch brain

2254
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:38,535
l'm superfly tnt. l'm the guns of
the navarone

2255
02:08:38,844 --> 02:08:40,971
ln fact, what the fuck am l doing
in the back?

2256
02:08:41,146 --> 02:08:43,410
You the motherfucker who should be
on brain detail

2257
02:08:43,649 --> 02:08:45,310
We fucking switching. l'm washing
the windows

2258
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,178
and you picking up this nigger's skull

2259
02:08:57,596 --> 02:08:58,756
Fine job, Gentlmen

2260
02:09:00,566 --> 02:09:01,794
We may get out this yet

2261
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:04,230
l can't believe this is the same car

2262
02:09:05,003 --> 02:09:07,995
Well, let's not start sucking each other's
dicks quite yet

2263
02:09:08,841 --> 02:09:10,206
Phase one is complete...clean the car...

2264
02:09:10,375 --> 02:09:11,967
which moves us right along to phase 2

2265
02:09:12,244 --> 02:09:13,074
clean you two

2266
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:17,580
Strip

2267
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:19,048
All the way?

2268
02:09:19,351 --> 02:09:20,443
To your bare ass

2269
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:23,216
Quickly, gentlemen

2270
02:09:23,822 --> 02:09:25,881
We got about 15 minutes before
Jimmie's better half

2271
02:09:26,125 --> 02:09:27,592
comes pulling into the driveway

2272
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:30,324
Damn. This morning air is some
chilly shit

2273
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:32,360
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

2274
02:09:32,698 --> 02:09:33,824
You know what you two look like?

2275
02:09:33,999 --> 02:09:34,727
What?

2276
02:09:34,967 --> 02:09:37,299
Like a couple of guys who just blew off
somebody's head

2277
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:41,801
Stripping off those bloody rags is
absolutely necessary

2278
02:09:46,278 --> 02:09:47,939
Toss them in Jim's garage bag

2279
02:09:48,180 --> 02:09:50,648
Don't do nothing stupid, like leaving
this shit out front

2280
02:09:50,883 --> 02:09:52,145
for otto the garbageman to pick up

2281
02:09:52,417 --> 02:09:53,042
You know what l'm saying?

2282
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:54,583
Don't worry. We're taking it with us

2283
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:56,748
Jim, the soap

2284
02:09:59,191 --> 02:09:59,714
Vincent

2285
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:00,983
OK, gentlemen

2286
02:10:01,193 --> 02:10:03,184
You've both been to county before
l'm sure

2287
02:10:03,462 --> 02:10:04,258
Here it comes

2288
02:10:05,998 --> 02:10:07,158
Goddamn! The Water's fucking cold

2289
02:10:07,432 --> 02:10:08,922
Better you than me, gentlemen

2290
02:10:09,635 --> 02:10:12,627
Ha ha ha! Don't be afraid of the soap

2291
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:13,699
Spread it around

2292
02:10:13,872 --> 02:10:14,930
Get him up there a little bit

2293
02:10:15,507 --> 02:10:16,405
Vincent's hair

2294
02:10:16,842 --> 02:10:18,833
Come on, do it, God damn it! Do it!

2295
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:21,644
Towel them

2296
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:35,188
They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes

2297
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:39,229
Perfect

2298
02:10:39,731 --> 02:10:42,199
Perfect. We couldn't have planned
this better

2299
02:10:43,368 --> 02:10:44,835
You guys look like...

2300
02:10:45,671 --> 02:10:47,002
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2301
02:10:47,873 --> 02:10:48,771
Dorks

2302
02:10:49,908 --> 02:10:51,375
They look like a couple of dorks

2303
02:10:51,677 --> 02:10:54,771
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes
motherfucker

2304
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,947
Come on, gentlemen

2305
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,648
We're laughing our way right into prison

2306
02:10:57,883 --> 02:10:58,872
Don't make me beg

2307
02:11:02,788 --> 02:11:03,846
OK, gentlemen

2308
02:11:04,056 --> 02:11:05,614
Let's get our rules of the road straight

2309
02:11:06,325 --> 02:11:08,691
We're goining to a place called
Monster Joe's truck and tow

2310
02:11:09,361 --> 02:11:13,058
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to our Dilemma

2311
02:11:13,332 --> 02:11:14,731
The place is North Hollywood

2312
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,331
so a few twists and turns aside

2313
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:18,002
we'll be going up Hollywood way

2314
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:21,203
Now, l'll drive the tainted car

2315
02:11:21,373 --> 02:11:22,567
Jules, you ride with me

2316
02:11:23,742 --> 02:11:25,676
Vincent, you follow in my Acura

2317
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:29,508
Now, if we come across the path of
any John Q. Laws

2318
02:11:29,748 --> 02:11:31,773
nobody does a fucking thing until
l do something

2319
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:33,110
.Right .What did l say?

2320
02:11:34,052 --> 02:11:35,417
Don't do shit unless...

2321
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:36,653
Unless what?

2322
02:11:36,922 --> 02:11:38,219
Unless you do it first

2323
02:11:38,457 --> 02:11:39,981
Spoken like a true prodigy

2324
02:11:40,726 --> 02:11:41,954
How about you, Lash Larue?

2325
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:44,219
Can you keep your spurs from jingling
and jangling?

2326
02:11:44,396 --> 02:11:46,887
Mr. Wolf, look, the gun went off
l don't know why

2327
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:48,293
l'm cool. l promise you

2328
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,401
Fair enough. Now, l drive real fucking
fast, so keep up

2329
02:11:51,803 --> 02:11:53,896
lf l get my car back any different than
l gave it

2330
02:11:54,106 --> 02:11:56,734
Monster Joe's going to be disposing
of 2 bodies

2331
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:01,503
Out of my way, Rex

2332
02:12:04,082 --> 02:12:05,049
We cool?

2333
02:12:05,317 --> 02:12:06,306
Like it never happened

2334
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:08,049
All right.

2335
02:12:08,253 --> 02:12:09,743
Boys, this is Raquel

2336
02:12:10,355 --> 02:12:12,789
Someday, all this will be hers

2337
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:15,989
Hi, so, what's with the outfits?

2338
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:18,626
You guys going to a vollleyball game
or something?

2339
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:22,691
l'm taking my lady out for breakfast

2340
02:12:23,035 --> 02:12:24,059
Maybe l could drop you two off

2341
02:12:24,336 --> 02:12:24,859
Where do you live?

2342
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:26,094
.Redondo .lnglewood

2343
02:12:26,638 --> 02:12:29,232
lt's...lt's your future

2344
02:12:29,808 --> 02:12:32,140
l...l see a...a cab ride

2345
02:12:32,744 --> 02:12:34,371
Move out of the sticks, fellas

2346
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,704
Say good night, Raquel

2347
02:12:35,881 --> 02:12:36,848
Good night, Raquel

2348
02:12:37,149 --> 02:12:38,411
l'll see you guys around

2349
02:12:38,684 --> 02:12:40,311
Stay out of trouble, you crazy kids

2350
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:44,319
Mr. Wolf, l just want to tell you it was
a real pleasure watching you work

2351
02:12:44,523 --> 02:12:46,548
Yeah, really, and thank you very much
Mr. Wolf

2352
02:12:48,493 --> 02:12:49,653
Call me Winston

2353
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:53,960
You see that, young lady? Respect

2354
02:12:54,766 --> 02:12:57,132
Respect for one's elders shows
character

2355
02:12:57,336 --> 02:12:58,325
l have character

2356
02:12:59,171 --> 02:13:02,834
Because you are a character doesn't
mean that you have character

2357
02:13:11,116 --> 02:13:12,242
Want to share a cab?

2358
02:13:13,185 --> 02:13:14,482
l could go for some breakfast

2359
02:13:14,686 --> 02:13:16,051
Feel like having breakfast with me?

2360
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:17,889
Cool

2361
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:24,985
l don't know why, l just thought

2362
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:26,697
he'd be European or something
because he...

2363
02:13:26,898 --> 02:13:28,866
Yo, man, he's about as European
as English bob

2364
02:13:29,034 --> 02:13:30,058
l know that now, but...

2365
02:13:30,268 --> 02:13:31,963
.Was he cool or what?
.Thank you

2366
02:13:32,237 --> 02:13:34,933
Totally fucking cool, in control

2367
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:38,341
Didn't even, you know, really get pissed
when you were fucking with him

2368
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:39,442
l was amazed

2369
02:13:41,146 --> 02:13:42,078
Want some bacon?

2370
02:13:42,314 --> 02:13:44,009
No, man. l don't eat pork

2371
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:45,281
Are you Jewish?

2372
02:13:45,484 --> 02:13:46,143
Naw, l ain't Jewish

2373
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:47,716
l just don't dig on swine, that's all

2374
02:13:47,853 --> 02:13:48,842
Why not?

2375
02:13:49,421 --> 02:13:52,356
Pigs are filthy animals.
l don't eat filthy animals

2376
02:13:52,557 --> 02:13:53,990
Yeah, but bacon tastes good

2377
02:13:54,526 --> 02:13:56,016
Pork chops taste good

2378
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:58,026
Hey, a sewer rat may taste like
pumpkin pie

2379
02:13:58,263 --> 02:14:00,754
but l'd never know because l wouldn't
eat the filthy motherfucker

2380
02:14:02,134 --> 02:14:04,034
Pigs sleep and root in shit

2381
02:14:04,269 --> 02:14:05,463
That's a filthy animal

2382
02:14:05,704 --> 02:14:08,673
l ain't eating nothing that ain't got sense
enough to disregard its own feces

2383
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:11,306
How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces

2384
02:14:11,643 --> 02:14:12,803
l don't eat dog, either

2385
02:14:13,678 --> 02:14:16,146
Yeah, but do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

2386
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:19,174
l wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy

2387
02:14:19,418 --> 02:14:20,851
but they're definitely dirty

2388
02:14:21,386 --> 02:14:23,149
But a dog's got personality

2389
02:14:23,355 --> 02:14:24,583
Personality goes a long way

2390
02:14:24,756 --> 02:14:26,189
Ah, so by that rationale

2391
02:14:26,425 --> 02:14:29,792
if a pig had a better personality
he would cease to be a filthy animal

2392
02:14:30,062 --> 02:14:30,756
ls that true?

2393
02:14:30,962 --> 02:14:33,829
Well, we'd have to be talking about
one charming motherfucking pig

2394
02:14:34,032 --> 02:14:36,057
l mean, he'd have to be 10 times
more charming than

2395
02:14:36,368 --> 02:14:37,300
that Arnold on Green Acres

2396
02:14:37,502 --> 02:14:38,196
You know what l'm saying?

2397
02:14:43,842 --> 02:14:45,241
Oh, man, that's good

2398
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:46,772
That's good, man.

2399
02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:48,671
You're starting to lighten up

2400
02:14:49,548 --> 02:14:51,812
You been sitting there all serious
and shit

2401
02:14:52,017 --> 02:14:53,609
Man, l've just been sitting here thinking

2402
02:14:53,885 --> 02:14:54,817
About what?

2403
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:56,554
About the miracle we witnessed

2404
02:14:57,089 --> 02:14:58,215
The miracle you witnessed

2405
02:14:58,423 --> 02:14:59,947
l witnessed a freak occurrence

2406
02:15:00,158 --> 02:15:01,523
What is a miracle, Vincent?

2407
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:04,555
An act of God

2408
02:15:04,763 --> 02:15:05,923
And what's an act of God?

2409
02:15:10,035 --> 02:15:11,332
When, um...

2410
02:15:11,870 --> 02:15:13,929
God makes the impossible possible

2411
02:15:15,073 --> 02:15:18,736
But this morning l don't think qualifies

2412
02:15:18,944 --> 02:15:19,706
Hey, Vincent

2413
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,708
don't you see that shit don't matter?

2414
02:15:21,913 --> 02:15:23,540
You're judging this shit the wrong way

2415
02:15:23,815 --> 02:15:25,612
l mean, it could be God stopped
the bullets

2416
02:15:25,884 --> 02:15:27,215
or he changed coke to pepsi

2417
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:28,852
he found my fucking car keys

2418
02:15:29,054 --> 02:15:31,318
You don't judge shit like this based
on merit

2419
02:15:31,523 --> 02:15:33,184
Now, whether or not what we
experienced

2420
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:36,952
was an '"According to Hoyle'" miracle
is insignificant

2421
02:15:37,195 --> 02:15:41,154
but what is significant is l felt the touch
of God

2422
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:42,898
God got invovled

2423
02:15:43,735 --> 02:15:45,032
But why?

2424
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,468
Well, that's what's fucking with me

2425
02:15:46,705 --> 02:15:47,694
l don't know why,

2426
02:15:47,973 --> 02:15:49,338
but l can't go back to sleep

2427
02:15:49,875 --> 02:15:50,933
You're serious?

2428
02:15:51,543 --> 02:15:52,874
You're really thinking about quitting?

2429
02:15:53,311 --> 02:15:54,505
.The life? .Yeah

2430
02:15:54,779 --> 02:15:56,371
.Most definitely .Fuck

2431
02:15:58,049 --> 02:15:59,175
What you going to do, then?

2432
02:16:00,285 --> 02:16:03,982
Well...that's what l've been sitting here
contemplating

2433
02:16:04,523 --> 02:16:07,788
First, l'm going to deliver this case
to Marsellus

2434
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:11,329
Then, basically, l'm just going to walk
the earth

2435
02:16:11,496 --> 02:16:12,793
What you mean walk the earth?

2436
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:14,829
You know, like Caine in Kung Fu

2437
02:16:15,066 --> 02:16:16,226
Walk from place to place

2438
02:16:16,434 --> 02:16:17,867
meet people get in adventures

2439
02:16:18,136 --> 02:16:20,400
And how long do you intend to walk
the earth?

2440
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,402
Until God puts me where he wants me
to be

2441
02:16:22,641 --> 02:16:23,869
And what if he don't do that?

2442
02:16:24,075 --> 02:16:26,100
lf it takes forever, then l'll walk forever

2443
02:16:26,978 --> 02:16:28,878
So you decided to be a bum?

2444
02:16:29,114 --> 02:16:32,015
l'll just be Jules, Vincent...no more
no less

2445
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:34,277
No, Jules. You decided to be a bum

2446
02:16:34,619 --> 02:16:37,782
just like all those pieces of shit out there
who beg for change

2447
02:16:37,989 --> 02:16:40,685
who sleep in garbage bins
eat what l throw away

2448
02:16:40,892 --> 02:16:42,291
They got a name for that, Jules

2449
02:16:42,527 --> 02:16:43,789
lt's called a bum

2450
02:16:43,962 --> 02:16:46,760
And without a job, a residence
or legal tender

2451
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:47,828
that's what you're going to be, man

2452
02:16:48,133 --> 02:16:49,691
You're going to be a fucking bum

2453
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:52,461
Look, my friend, this is just where you
and l differ

2454
02:16:52,704 --> 02:16:53,636
Garcon!

2455
02:16:54,806 --> 02:16:55,602
Coffee!

2456
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,537
Jules, look, what happened this morning

2457
02:16:57,709 --> 02:16:59,609
man, l agree it was peculiar

2458
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:00,477
Garcon means boy

2459
02:17:00,712 --> 02:17:01,508
But water into wine. l...

2460
02:17:01,713 --> 02:17:03,203
All shapes and sizes, Vincent

2461
02:17:03,415 --> 02:17:04,939
Don't fucking talk to me that way, Man

2462
02:17:05,116 --> 02:17:06,481
lf my answer frighten you, Vincent

2463
02:17:06,685 --> 02:17:08,949
then you should cease asking scary
questions

2464
02:17:12,324 --> 02:17:13,757
l'm going to take a shit

2465
02:17:18,396 --> 02:17:19,556
Let me ask you something

2466
02:17:19,998 --> 02:17:21,124
When did you make this decision?

2467
02:17:21,366 --> 02:17:22,856
When you were sitting there eating
that muffin?

2468
02:17:23,068 --> 02:17:23,864
Well, yeah.

2469
02:17:24,102 --> 02:17:26,502
l was sitting here eating my muffin and
drinking my coffee...

2470
02:17:26,705 --> 02:17:28,468
and replaying the incident in my head...

2471
02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:32,576
when l had what alcoholics refer to as
a moment of clarity

2472
02:17:33,478 --> 02:17:35,969
Fuck. To be continued

2473
02:17:48,026 --> 02:17:49,493
l love you, Pumpkin

2474
02:17:49,694 --> 02:17:51,059
And l love you Honey Bunny

2475
02:17:52,430 --> 02:17:54,261
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

2476
02:17:55,166 --> 02:17:57,430
Any of you fucking pricks move

2477
02:17:57,669 --> 02:18:00,502
and l'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!

2478
02:18:00,739 --> 02:18:01,763
You got that?

2479
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:03,739
You just be quiet!

2480
02:18:03,975 --> 02:18:06,910
Get the fuck down! Get the fuck down!

2481
02:18:07,345 --> 02:18:08,744
You, you're in a blind spot

2482
02:18:08,913 --> 02:18:11,814
Take your dames over to that booth
over there on the count of 10

2483
02:18:12,017 --> 02:18:13,314
Mexicans out of the fucking kitchen!

2484
02:18:13,485 --> 02:18:16,249
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

2485
02:18:16,521 --> 02:18:17,545
Where the fuck are you going?

2486
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:19,189
You fucking yuppie! Get down!

2487
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:21,754
Hey, you, throw those bags!

2488
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:24,554
Fucking wanker! Move! Move!

2489
02:18:24,996 --> 02:18:27,556
What the fuck are you doing? Move!

2490
02:18:27,832 --> 02:18:28,958
The restaurant's ours!

2491
02:18:29,167 --> 02:18:29,997
Move! Get down on the fucking floor!

2492
02:18:30,168 --> 02:18:31,999
Grandpa, down!

2493
02:18:32,337 --> 02:18:33,497
l'm the Manager here

2494
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:34,761
and there's no problem...

2495
02:18:34,973 --> 02:18:35,871
No problem at all

2496
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:37,303
You're going to give me a problem?

2497
02:18:37,575 --> 02:18:38,132
No, sir, l'm not

2498
02:18:38,443 --> 02:18:40,070
l thought you said you're going to
give me a fucking problem!

2499
02:18:40,312 --> 02:18:41,836
You're going to give me a fucking
problem?

2500
02:18:44,249 --> 02:18:45,716
l think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny!

2501
02:18:45,884 --> 02:18:47,749
Well, just execute him!

2502
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:51,348
l'm not a hero. l'm just a coffee shop...

2503
02:18:51,690 --> 02:18:52,748
Get the fuck down!

2504
02:18:53,191 --> 02:18:54,488
The restaurant's ours!

2505
02:18:54,693 --> 02:18:56,320
Just take whatever you want

2506
02:18:57,796 --> 02:18:58,922
All right, you talk to the customers

2507
02:18:59,097 --> 02:18:59,495
Yeah

2508
02:18:59,698 --> 02:19:00,756
You tell them to be fucking cool...

2509
02:19:00,999 --> 02:19:01,431
Yes

2510
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:02,725
.And everything will be over!
.Yeah

2511
02:19:02,934 --> 02:19:04,458
.You understand me? .Yes

2512
02:19:07,072 --> 02:19:08,369
Listen, everybody

2513
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:10,100

2515
02:19:11,776 --> 02:19:13,971

02:19:14,245 --> 02:19:16,008

your wallets

2519
02:19:31,629 --> 02:19:32,755
You don't fucking talk

2520
02:19:32,964 --> 02:19:34,864
You just throw them in the bag.
Are we clear?

2521
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:36,959
l said, are we fucking clear?

2522
02:19:37,602 --> 02:19:39,160
Good. Now wallets out

02:19:52,484 --> 02:19:54,111

02:20:06,164 --> 02:20:07,131
ln the bag

2536

ln the bag

2537
02:20:36,628 --> 02:20:37,560
What's in the case?

2538
02:20:37,762 --> 02:20:39,195
My boss's dirty laundry

2539
02:20:39,397 --> 02:20:40,489
Your boss makes you do his laundry?

2540
02:20:40,732 --> 02:20:41,562
When he wants it clean

2541
02:20:41,766 --> 02:20:42,698
Sounds like a shit job

2542
02:20:42,901 --> 02:20:44,698
Funny. l was thinking the same thing

2543
02:20:44,869 --> 02:20:45,801
Open it

2544
02:20:46,304 --> 02:20:47,498
Afraid l can't do that

2545
02:20:49,741 --> 02:20:51,971
.l didn't hear you .Yes, you did

2546
02:20:53,244 --> 02:20:54,472
What's going on?

2547
02:20:55,246 --> 02:20:57,180
Looks like we got a vigilante
in our midst

2548
02:20:57,549 --> 02:20:58,948
Shoot him in the face

2549
02:20:59,117 --> 02:21:01,017
l hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time

2550
02:21:01,319 --> 02:21:02,445
l've had a gun pointed at me

2551
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:04,815
You don't take your fucking hand off
that case, it'll be your last

2552
02:21:05,056 --> 02:21:06,250
Stop causing problems!

2553
02:21:06,491 --> 02:21:07,480
You'll get us all killed!

2554
02:21:07,725 --> 02:21:08,851
Give them what you got and get them
out of there!

2555
02:21:09,027 --> 02:21:10,255
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2556
02:21:10,462 --> 02:21:11,929
This ain't none of your goddamn
business

2557
02:21:13,665 --> 02:21:15,496
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool

2558
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,597
lt's no problem. l got it under control

2559
02:21:19,504 --> 02:21:21,096
Now l'm going to count to 3

2560
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:24,508
lf you don't open that case

2561
02:21:24,809 --> 02:21:26,709
l'm going to unload in your fucking face

2562
02:21:31,449 --> 02:21:32,473
We clear?

2563
02:21:36,654 --> 02:21:37,552
1 ...

2564
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,924
2...

2565
02:21:43,495 --> 02:21:44,860
.3 .OK, Ringo

2566
02:21:45,163 --> 02:21:46,130
You win

2567
02:21:47,098 --> 02:21:47,996
lt's yours

2568
02:21:54,072 --> 02:21:55,004
Open it

2569
02:22:00,044 --> 02:22:01,136
What is it?

2570
02:22:02,347 --> 02:22:03,371
What is it?

2571
02:22:05,683 --> 02:22:08,311
.ls that what l think it is?
.Mm.hmm

2572
02:22:11,789 --> 02:22:12,949
lt's beautiful

2573
02:22:13,157 --> 02:22:15,387
God damn it, what is it?

2574
02:22:18,129 --> 02:22:20,689
You let him go! You let him go!

2575
02:22:20,999 --> 02:22:21,522
Let go of him!

2576
02:22:21,733 --> 02:22:23,462
.Tell that bitch to be cool!
.l'm gonna kill you!

2577
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:25,692
.Say, '"Bitch, be cool!'"
.Be cool, Honey Bunny.

2578
02:22:26,004 --> 02:22:27,130
.Say, '"Bitch, be cool!'"
.Be cool!

2579
02:22:27,405 --> 02:22:28,337
Tell that fucking bitch to chill!

2580
02:22:28,773 --> 02:22:29,740
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2581
02:22:30,041 --> 02:22:30,905
Chill that fucking bitch out!

2582
02:22:31,142 --> 02:22:32,074
Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2583
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:34,041
.Let go of him! .Chill!

2584
02:22:34,445 --> 02:22:35,412
Tell her it's going to be all right

2585
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:36,146
lt's going to be all right

2586
02:22:36,347 --> 02:22:37,245
.Promise her! .l promise!

2587
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:38,210
Tell her to chill!

2588
02:22:38,449 --> 02:22:39,211
Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2589
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,212
All right, now tell me her name

2590
02:22:40,618 --> 02:22:41,141
Yolanda

2591
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:42,444
All right, now, Yolanda!

2592
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:44,549
We're not gonna do anything stupid
are we?

2593
02:22:44,756 --> 02:22:45,586
Don't you hurt him!

2594
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:47,485
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody

2595
02:22:47,692 --> 02:22:49,887
We're all gonna be like 3 little
fonzies here

2596
02:22:50,061 --> 02:22:51,085
And what's fonzie like?

2597
02:22:52,564 --> 02:22:54,532
Come on, Yolanda, what's fonzie like?!

2598
02:22:54,699 --> 02:22:55,256
He's cool?

2599
02:22:55,433 --> 02:22:56,365
.What? .Cool

2600
02:22:56,601 --> 02:22:58,193
Correctamundo!

2601
02:22:58,503 --> 02:23:01,870
And that's what we're gonna be
We're gonna be cool

2602
02:23:02,273 --> 02:23:06,369
Now, Ringo, l'm gonna count to 3

2603
02:23:07,045 --> 02:23:08,637
And when l count 3

2604
02:23:09,047 --> 02:23:10,708
l want you to let go of your gun

2605
02:23:11,215 --> 02:23:13,376
put your palms flat on the table

2606
02:23:13,885 --> 02:23:16,012
and sit your ass down

2607
02:23:16,621 --> 02:23:20,421
But when you do it, you do it cool

2608
02:23:20,992 --> 02:23:21,856
You ready?

2609
02:23:23,294 --> 02:23:24,454
1 ...

2610
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:26,692
2...

2611
02:23:27,799 --> 02:23:28,823
3

2612
02:23:37,675 --> 02:23:38,972
OK, now you let him go!

2613
02:23:39,177 --> 02:23:41,168
Yolanda, l thought we were gonna
be cool

2614
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:43,506
Now, when you yell at me
it makes me nervous

2615
02:23:43,681 --> 02:23:45,615
And when l get nervous, l get scared

2616
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:47,249
And when motherfuckers get scared

2617
02:23:47,452 --> 02:23:50,046
that' when motherfuckers accidentally
get shot

2618
02:23:51,356 --> 02:23:54,587
Just know, you hurt him, you die

2619
02:23:55,793 --> 02:23:57,988
Well, that seems to be the situation

2620
02:23:58,429 --> 02:24:02,024
But l don't want that, and you don't
want that

2621
02:24:02,233 --> 02:24:05,168
and Ringo here definitely doesn't
want that

2622
02:24:05,336 --> 02:24:06,928
So let's see what we can do

2623
02:24:08,906 --> 02:24:09,668
Now...

2624
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:12,472
Here's the situation

2625
02:24:13,411 --> 02:24:14,639
Normally both your asses

2626
02:24:14,912 --> 02:24:16,743
would be dead as fucking fried chicken

2627
02:24:16,948 --> 02:24:18,006
but you happened to pull this shit

2628
02:24:18,282 --> 02:24:19,340
while l'm in a transitional period

2629
02:24:19,617 --> 02:24:20,549
and l don't want to kill you

2630
02:24:20,718 --> 02:24:21,844
l want to help you

2631
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:24,012
But l can't give you this case

2632
02:24:24,822 --> 02:24:26,380
'cause it don't belong to me

2633
02:24:26,991 --> 02:24:30,290
Besides, l been through too much shit
over this case this morning

2634
02:24:30,528 --> 02:24:32,553
To just hand it over to your dumb ass

2635
02:24:33,598 --> 02:24:34,121
Vincent!

2636
02:24:34,866 --> 02:24:35,833
Be cool!

2637
02:24:36,768 --> 02:24:39,896
Yolanda, it's cool, baby! lt's cool!

2638
02:24:40,071 --> 02:24:41,038
We still just talking!

2639
02:24:41,205 --> 02:24:42,570
Come on, point the gun at me!

2640
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,035
Point the gun at me! There you go

2641
02:24:45,243 --> 02:24:49,441
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing

2642
02:24:49,647 --> 02:24:50,636
Tell her we're still cool

2643
02:24:52,016 --> 02:24:53,483
We're still cool, Honey Bunny

2644
02:24:53,751 --> 02:24:54,683
How we doing, baby?

2645
02:24:55,987 --> 02:24:59,889
l...l gotta go pee. l want to go home

2646
02:25:00,091 --> 02:25:00,682
Just hang in there, baby

2647
02:25:00,992 --> 02:25:02,254
You're doing great. l'm proud of you

2648
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:03,620
And Ringo's proud of you

2649
02:25:03,895 --> 02:25:04,953
lt's almost over

2650
02:25:05,329 --> 02:25:06,626
Tell her you're proud of her

2651
02:25:07,398 --> 02:25:08,592
l'm proud of you, Honey Bunny

2652
02:25:08,966 --> 02:25:09,990
l love you

2653
02:25:10,635 --> 02:25:12,034
l love you, too, Honey Bunny

2654
02:25:12,236 --> 02:25:17,674
Now, l want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet

2655
02:25:20,478 --> 02:25:21,376
Which one is it?

2656
02:25:21,579 --> 02:25:23,638
lt's the one that says
'"Bad Motherfucker'"

2657
02:25:38,896 --> 02:25:39,828
That's it

2658
02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:41,789
That's my bad motherfucker

2659
02:25:41,966 --> 02:25:43,695
Open it up. Take out the money

2660
02:25:50,108 --> 02:25:50,938
Count it

2661
02:25:58,116 --> 02:25:59,083
How much is there?

2662
02:26:02,854 --> 02:26:04,082
About $1 ,500

2663
02:26:04,288 --> 02:26:06,552
OK, put it in your pocket. lt's yours

2664
02:26:07,692 --> 02:26:09,853
Now, with the rest of those wallets and
the register

2665
02:26:10,361 --> 02:26:12,488
that makes this a pretty successful
little score

2666
02:26:12,697 --> 02:26:14,892
Jules, you give that fucking
nimrod $1 ,500

2667
02:26:15,133 --> 02:26:16,464
And l'll shoot him on general principle

2668
02:26:16,667 --> 02:26:17,497
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2669
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:19,669
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckering thing

2670
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:21,805
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2671
02:26:22,740 --> 02:26:23,331
Shut up!

2672
02:26:23,541 --> 02:26:25,065
Come on, Yolanda, stay with me, baby

2673
02:26:26,744 --> 02:26:28,769
Now, l ain't giving it to him, Vincent

2674
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:31,343
l'm buying something for my money

2675
02:26:32,717 --> 02:26:34,207
Wanna know what l'm buying, Ringo?

2676
02:26:34,886 --> 02:26:35,784
What?

2677
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,109
Your life

2678
02:26:37,588 --> 02:26:40,386
l'm giving you that money so l don't have
to kill your ass

2679
02:26:41,959 --> 02:26:43,221
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2680
02:26:44,762 --> 02:26:46,161
Not regularly, no

2681
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,932
Well, there's this passage
l got memorized

2682
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:51,564
Ezekiel 25:17

2683
02:26:52,703 --> 02:26:55,763
The path of the righteous man is beset
on all sides

2684
02:26:55,973 --> 02:26:59,807
by the inequities of the selfish
and tyranny of evil men

2685
02:27:00,077 --> 02:27:03,012
Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will

2686
02:27:03,181 --> 02:27:05,115
shepherds the weak through the valley
of darkness

2687
02:27:05,416 --> 02:27:06,849
for he is truly his brother's keeper

2688
02:27:07,084 --> 02:27:09,109
and the finder of lost children

2689
02:27:09,687 --> 02:27:11,552
And l will strike down upon thee

2690
02:27:11,756 --> 02:27:14,020
with great vengeance and furious anger

2691
02:27:14,225 --> 02:27:17,160
those who attempt to poison and
destroy my brothers

2692
02:27:17,829 --> 02:27:19,990
and you will know l am the Lord

2693
02:27:20,264 --> 02:27:22,562
when l lay my vengeance upon you

2694
02:27:24,836 --> 02:27:27,066
Now, l been saying that shit for years

2695
02:27:27,271 --> 02:27:30,263
And if you heard it, that meant your ass

2696
02:27:31,742 --> 02:27:33,573
l never gave much thought to what
it meant

2697
02:27:33,778 --> 02:27:36,144
l just thought it was some cold.blooded
shit to say to a motherfucker

2698
02:27:36,414 --> 02:27:38,348
before it popped a cap in his ass

2699
02:27:38,983 --> 02:27:41,474
But l saw some shit this morning made
me think twice

2700
02:27:42,587 --> 02:27:44,248
See, now l'm thinking...

2701
02:27:44,822 --> 02:27:48,155
maybe it means you're the evil man

2702
02:27:48,426 --> 02:27:50,326
and l'm the righteous man,

2703
02:27:50,528 --> 02:27:52,496
and Mr. 9.millimeter here

2704
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:56,496
He's the shepherd protecting my
righteous ass in the valley of darkness

2705
02:27:57,201 --> 02:28:02,264
Or it could mean you're the righteous
man and l'm the shepherd

2706
02:28:02,773 --> 02:28:06,209
and it's the world that's evil and selfish

2707
02:28:06,911 --> 02:28:08,276
Now, l'd like that

2708
02:28:09,113 --> 02:28:10,842
But that shit ain't the truth

2709
02:28:12,216 --> 02:28:13,843
The truth is...

2710
02:28:15,386 --> 02:28:17,286
you're the weak...

2711
02:28:18,356 --> 02:28:21,655
and l am the tyranny of evil men

2712
02:28:23,127 --> 02:28:25,357
But l'm trying, Ringo

2713
02:28:26,097 --> 02:28:31,034
l'm trying real hard to be the shepherd

2714
02:28:47,285 --> 02:28:48,684
Go on

2715
02:29:07,238 --> 02:29:08,967
l think we should be leaving now

2716
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:11,605
Yeah, that's probably a good idea
