爸爸,什么?你在跟踪我吗?
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,800
不，但我不知道还能做什么，因为你不接电话——你能理解我的暗示——我觉得这有点荒唐愚蠢了?
No, but I don't know what else to do because you're not answering your phone - You can understand the hint - I think it's getting a little ridiculous silly?

32
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:52,000
你说我不应该因为他而那样崩溃因为他是个混蛋不，我说他可能不属于你给他的那个高台他也不是你想象中的殉道者
You told me I shouldn't collapse like that because of him because he was a bastard No, I said he might not belong to that high platform you put him on And that he was not a martyr as you imagined him

33
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
你就是这样安慰你女儿的吗?
Is this how you comfort your daughter?

34

我只是希望你能继续你的生活我不想继续，我想念他每天，我想念他看我的眼神我想念我曾经的感觉-亲爱的-别这样
I just want you to be able to move on with your life I don't want to move on, I miss him Every day, I miss the way he used to look at me I miss the feeling I used to have - Honey - Don't do that

35
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,960
我不做什么?你以为你是谁，贝琪?
I don't do what? What do you think you are, Becky?

36
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,080
-离你远点-你不会开车的-停下-从我面前消失!
- Get away from you - You won't drive - Stop . - Get out of my face!

37
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:23,840
你不能这样叫我我把你和你妈妈养大，就是为了让他们变得更好所以喝得酩酊大醉，让你爱的人远离你这没用的听着，你身上发生了可怕的事
You can't call me like that I raised you and your mother to be better than that So get drunk and keep your loved ones away It won't work Well listen, something terrible happened to you

我最好走
I better walk

40
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:50,200
我问你一个问题如果情况反过来，如果你那天摔倒了你觉得丹会一个人站在这里吗?
Let me ask you a question If the situation is reversed, If you fell that day Do you think Dan would stand here alone?

41
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:02,840
沉溺于酒精，悲伤和悲伤，不管你是什么都不会是你很清楚该死的贝琪，我想让你试试
Drowning in drink, sadness and sorrow, whatever you are It won't be And you know that very well Damn Becky, I want you to try

42

I will rest when I die I prepared for something, and I need a partner to accompany me

53
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:49,880

Listen, your dad called me a few weeks ago He didn't know who to turn to and said you were in a bad situation - He doesn't have the right to do that - He's worried about you

54
00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:00,080
新的一年很快就要到来了，他不想让你一个人听着，唯一让我抓狂的是丹的罐头里满是灰尘他是我最好的朋友，被困在这里
The year will soon come and he doesn't want you to be alone Look, the only thing that drives me nuts is Dan's canned remains full of dust in there He being my best friend stuck here with him

It will be an adventure, like the old days And you can throw Dan's ashes upstairs I... haven't climbed anything since... I understand you But if you don't face your fears, you will always be afraid

替补
understudy

113

强者生存，对吧?

如果你在这里挨饿，你也会这么做的
You would do the same thing if you were starving here

115
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,600

After Dan died, I was afraid of my shadow But I struggled and got over it I got over the fear, I took control Don't let this fear eat you Confront him directly and eliminate him

If you can beat it, you can beat anything I'm here by your side all the time

Can we rest a little? I need a drink naturally

139
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,320
这些线条表示我们已经走了一半
These lines mean we've come halfway

140

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,440
没有
no

233
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,320
我的天，我的天，该死
Oh my God, oh my God, damn it

234
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,000
-别放手-我抓住你了"猎人"
- Don't let go - Yeah, I catch you "Hunter"

235
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,400
天啊，别让我走
Oh my God, please don't let me go

236
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,760
不要离开
don't get away

237
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,680
胸大肌?
Pecs?

238
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
抓住你胸大肌
catch you pecs

239
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,840
我能看见梯子
I can see the ladder

240
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
抓住你
catch you

241
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,680
我差点就死了
I just almost died

242
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:55,240
我的天这是怎么回事?天啊天啊，真希望我们拍下了你在这里在我尿在衣服里之前我们回地球吧好吧，休息几分钟好吧
My God Did this just happen? My God Oh my God, we wish we had filmed that you are here Let's go back to Earth before I actually pee in my clothes Yes Well, take a break for a couple of minutes Well

243
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,320
不，是和平他堕落了
No, peace He fell

244
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
亨特，我们怎么下去?
Hunter, how do we get off?

245
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:35,440
拜托告诉我有办法下去杆子上没有我可以踩的东西不-不-不，不，不，一定有东西
Please tell me there is a way down There's nothing on the pole that I can put my feet on no - No - No, no, no There must be something

246
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,920
不，该死，我没有变速器
No, damn it, I don't have a transmission

247
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:50,600
我也没有信号我确定有什么东西我确定只是这里有点波动不，我们太高了，这里没有信号我们会没事的
I don't have any sending either I'm sure there's something that I'm sure is just choppy here No, we're too high, no transmission here we'll be fine

248
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,480
恐慌现在对我们没有任何好处，所以先喘口气我们被困在荒无人烟的披萨大小的平台上了，亨特。
Panicking won't do us any good right now, so just take a breath We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform in the middle of nowhere, Hunter.

249
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,040
贝琪，慌张对我们没有任何好处这对我们没有好处，好吗?没有什么问题
Becky, panicking won't do us any good It won't help us, okay? There is nothing wrong

250
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,200
-我相信我们可以…-嘿，亨特，亨特，看这个。
- I'm sure we can... - Hey, Hunter, Hunter, Hunter, look at this.

251
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:19,320
我的天双筒望远镜，太神奇了我们有红绿灯好吧，好吧，太棒了好，酷
My God Binoculars, that's amazing Well We have a traffic light Well - Well - that's great OK, cool

252
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:41,880
该死，我们的包在下面我们的水在下面该死，我们要渴死了不，不我们没有水，迷路了就会死那声音，这东西坠毁时发出的声音
Damn, our bag is down Our water is below Damn, we're going to die of thirst No no We don't have water, that's how you die when you're lost The noise, the noise this thing made when it crashed

253
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:51,400
不可能没人听到我们说话的时候我打了很多紧急电话你真的这么认为吗?
It is impossible for no one to hear it I'm sure I've made a lot of emergency calls as we speak Do you really think so?

254
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:58,520
是的是的，骑兵会来的，我们只需要等好吧好吧
Yes Yes, the cavalry will arrive, well, we just have to wait Well Well

255
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,320
诅咒是什么?什么?贝琪，你的腿，我的天啊
the curse what? What? Becky, your leg, oh my goodness

256
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:18,640
这是什么?我都没注意到等等，等等来吧，我们点一下-好疼啊-你没事吧?我知道，抱歉，抱歉你能先警告我吗?好吧
Well, what is this? I didn't even notice it wait wait Come on, let's click on it - It hurts so badly - Are you okay? I know, sorry, sorry Can you warn me first? Well

257
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,840
-数到三-对，一，二，对不起，我很抱歉知道-该死-你没事吧?是的，我知道我是……我很好,这是……
- Count to three or something - Yeah, one, two, sorry I am very sorry Know - Damn - Are you okay? ArLionZ - By Mandooz Yeah, I know I'm... I'm fine, that's...

258
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,720
-就这么做-不-就这么做-不，没关系，我能控制自己，我开始生气了
- Just do it - No - Just do it - No, it's okay, I can control myself I'm starting to get annoyed

259
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:58,440
你能再走远点吗?这更像是ArLionZ - Mandooz -好吧，小心，在边缘-我试着停止看我我的天啊，太方便了
Can you get away any further? This is more like ArLionZ - By Mandooz - Well, beware, over the edge - I'm trying to stop looking at me Oh my God, how convenient

260
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:07,160
我很高兴你没觉得有必要排便我们得想个舒服的办法我想我们会在这里待上一段时间
I'm so glad you didn't feel the need to defecate Well, we need to find a way to feel comfortable that I think we'll be here for a while

261
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
好吧
Well

262
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,040
好吧
Well

263
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,720
你真的认为有人要来吗?
Do you really think someone is coming?

264
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,200
百万百分比
million percent

265
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,480
嘿，危险爱好者，怎么了?
Hey danger lover, what's going on?

266
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,120
我来告诉你怎么回事，贝琪·C。
I'll tell you what's going on, Becky C.

267
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:21,000
我们被困在了两千英尺高的塔顶上我们没办法从上面下来我录了一些我人生中最棒的磁带我没办法下载
We're stuck at the top of a 2,000-foot tower And we have no way to get off of it I made some of the best tapes of my life I don't have a way to download it

268
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,040
这就是你对现状的担忧吗?
Is that what worries you about the situation?

269
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:34,480
这太荒谬了别担心，如果你掉下去，你会出名的那个死于自拍的女孩太荒谬了我希望人们在我活着的时候记住我而不是在我死的时候
This is ridiculous Don't worry, you'll be famous if you fall Being the girl who died taking a selfie is ridiculous I want people to remember me in my life and not in my death

270
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:45,520
非常感谢你，标题，我更喜欢生标题，贝基，是卑鄙的标题，亨特说她在YouTube上发布视频是为了钱但我真的认为她是一个喜欢喜欢的婊子
Thank you very much, title, I prefer life over death Title, "Becky" is despicable Title, Hunter says she posts videos on YouTube for money But I really think she's a bitch who likes to like

271
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,120
-不是那样的-那是怎么回事
- It's not like that - How is it then?

272
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
来吧，展示你是谁，展示给我们看"希洛·亨特"
Come on, show who you are, show us "Shilo Hunter"

273
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,600
当你在网上发布视频时告诉我们
Tell us when you post videos online

274
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,520
首先，你是个贱人是的，其次
Well, first you are a bitch Yes secondly

275
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,080
这看起来很荒谬
This would seem ridiculous

276
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,320
但我这么做是因为丹。
But I'm doing this because of Dan.

277
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,840
发生的一切，让我意识到生命是多么短暂
What happened, made me realize how fleeting life is

278
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:38,160
我想要传播的信息是生命短暂，太短暂了所以你要抓住每一刻你要做一些让你感觉活着的事情
And I want to spread the message that life is short, too short So you have to seize every moment You have to do something that makes you feel alive

279
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:56,360
太棒了，我告诉过你，你只需要做你自己太酷了
that was amazing I told you, you just have to be yourself That was really cool

280
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,480
我应该扼杀对危险的热爱吗?
Should I kill the love of danger?

281
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,480
是的，我会帮你埋尸体
Yes, I'll help you bury the body

282
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,640
该死，那边有辆旧拖车我能看看吗?
Damn, there's an old trailer over there May I see it?

283
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,480
不久之后，在大门后面
Behind the gate, shortly afterwards

284
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,560
是啊，看起来废弃了
Yeah, it looks deserted

285
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,800
如果有人报警已经5个小时了，他们现在就会打来了
It's been five hours if someone called 911, they'd be calling now

286
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:04,000
我的天，该死的贝基，如果这里没有信号下面肯定有信号你还记得吗?得到所有这些赞了吗?
My God the curse Hey Becky, if we don't have a transmission here We definitely had a transmission below Do you remember? Got all those likes?

287
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:14,520
死好吧好吧，那我们就不知道我们是在什么时候失去了信号也许是因为干扰了广播天线我想你肯定有问题，亨特。
Die Well Well, then we don't know at what point we lost the transmission Maybe it was here because of jamming with the broadcast antenna I think you must have a problem with that, Hunter.

288
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:27,240
我们有一根50英尺长的绳子-我们可以找找掩护。我想用它来证明-我的发带-是的很好你能给紧急服务部门发个信息吗?
Well, we have a 50-foot rope - We can try to find coverage . - Yeah I want something to prove with it - My hair tie - Yeah cool Well Well Can you send a message to emergency services?

289
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:40,720
我不这么认为，但我有6万多粉丝好吧帮帮我们，我们被困在B67塔里了，打911它准备发布了我们应该在发送的时候听到它
I don't think so but I have over 60,000 followers Well Help us , we are stuck on the B67 tower, call 911 It's ready to publish We should hear it when it's being sent

290
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:53,600
来吧，来吧好吧
come on, come on Well Well

291
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,480
看看能不能再降一点
Let's see if I can lower it further

292
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,840
小心点，我拿到了，好吗快点
Be careful I get it, okay Come on

293
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,520
结束了-我什么都没听到-我也是，我不认为这是发布的
this is the end - I didn't hear anything - Me too I don't think it was posted

294
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,360
好吧，也许我可以把它放得更低你什么意思…我找到了，我有主意了
Well, maybe I can lower it even more what do you mean... I found it, I have an idea

295
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,920
当心,猎人!
Beware, Hunter!

296
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,640
你还好吗?是的，我很好
looks stable Are you well? Yes, I am fine

297

抓住了他

303
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,120
你发广告了吗?
Did you post the ad?

304
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,200
不-我们现在怎么办?我不知道
no - What do we do now? I don't know

305
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:48,160
嘿，等等，我们知道基地里肯定有信号是的如果我们把手机扔了呢?但如果我的手机摔成一百万个碎片呢?
Hey, wait, we know there's a transmission in the base for sure Yes What if we just throw the phone away? But what if my phone is smashed into a million pieces?

306
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:59,400
如果我们加强了他的能力，他就不会像扔鸡蛋那样做了该死的我们只需要放点东西进去是的，这是它和轴融合了
Not if we somehow reinforced him so he wouldn't do it like the egg-throwing challenge Yeah, well, damn it We just need something to put in it Yes this is It's fused to the shaft

Oh my God, they are coming

338
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,440
该死，他们找到车了找到我们的车了，找到了
Damn, they found the car They found our car, they found our car

339
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,680
他们有个杠杆他们可能会打开门-好吧，好吧嘿，这是什么?
They have a lever They will probably open the gate - ok - ok Hey, what is this?

340
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,880
嘿，怎么了?
Hey, what's going on?

341
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:27,360
停止什么?别八卦了，去开门不不不，这是什么?他们偷了我的车什么?-不，你这个野蛮人!
stop what? Stop gossiping, go open the gate no No, no, what is this? They steal my car what? - No, you savage!

342
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,160
-不，不-你这个混蛋，这是什么?
- No, no - You bastard, what is this?

343
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,080
-不，不-我一定要看你这野蛮人我的天啊
- No, no - I have to see that Well, you savages My God

344
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:36,160
好吧，新规则我们中的一个从塔上下来带上你的手机她下来的时候会打电话求助
Well, new rule One of us comes down from the tower Take your cell phone with her She calls for help on the way down

345
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,960
也许你会把视频发布出去，我开玩笑的
Maybe you will post that video I'm kidding

346
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:57,680
我的腿，我现在可以像吃糖果一样吃阿司匹林看起来很糟糕，需要洗一下
My leg, I can eat aspirin like it's candy right now Yeah, looks really bad, needs some washing, huh

347
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,120
对不起
sorry

348
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,000
我们把它盖好
Let's keep it covered

349
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,200
有什么事吗?
What's the matter?

350
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,760
丹从来没说过我爱你
Dan could never say I love you

351
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,520
鈥≠べ?
鈥≠べ?

352
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,320
鈥≠べ?
鈥≠べ?

353
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,120
贝基,我…自从多久?
Becky, I... Since how long?

354
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
四个月
four months

355
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:07,640
这是个天大的错误对不起，非常抱歉因为你和我丈夫有一腿还是因为我发现了?
It was a huge mistake Sorry, so sorry Because you had an affair with my husband or because I found out?

356
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,440
因为我们爱着同一个男人
Because we loved the same man

357
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,320
是谁采取的行动?
Who made the move?

358
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,480
-我们都喝多了——谁?
- We were both pretty drunk. - Who?

359
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,560
他是
he is

360
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,200
但这是个天大的错误，贝克斯。
But it was a big mistake, Bex.

361
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:05,560
不一个吻是个错误，一夜情你说你爱他…
no A kiss is a mistake, a one-night stand affair You said you loved him so...

362
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:25,240
一切都失控了，我努力不去控制但我还是爱上了他他在听我说话，他…他和我约会过的其他混蛋都不一样我以前从来没有过那种感觉
It got out of control I tried so hard not to but I fell in love with him He was listening to me, he was... He was different from every other bastard I'd ever date I've never had that feeling before

363
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,240
然后你让我做你的伴娘，我突然意识到一切都是那么混乱
Then you asked me to be your bridesmaid and suddenly I realized how completely turbulent everything was

364
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,360
我爱他，但是……
I loved him but...

365
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,600
但我更爱你，所以我结束了这段关系
But I love you more so I ended the relationship

366
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,760
看到你俩在一起，我很难过
It was so hard for me to see you two together

367
00:58:48,840 --> 00:59:05,480
丹死后我…我没有足够的力量陪在你身边，没有足够的力量陪着你，所以…所以我跑了现在你恨我，我不怪你现在我们被困在这该死的塔上
And after Dan died, I... I didn't have enough strength to be by your side To be strong enough for you, so... So I ran away Now you hate me and I don't blame you And now we're stuck on this damn tower

368
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,520
在一个偏远的地方，这都是我的错
In the middle of a remote place and it's all my fault

369
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,200
我很抱歉
I am very sorry

370
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,800
这是什么?
What is this?

371
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,120
昨天电话掉了，我接住了
I caught it when we dropped the phone yesterday

372
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,840
已经24小时了
It's been 24 hours

373
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:49,160
我想是时候接受事实了，你的六万粉丝中没有一个真正关心你或者你的手机是最底层的，被切割了一百万块我们还有一次机会，在你的手机上
I guess it's time to accept that none of your 60,000 followers really care about you Or your phone is at the bottom cut a million pieces Well, we have another chance, on your phone

374
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,120
是的，但我们这次没有航线，这意味着机会更小了如果我们失败了，我们就没有希望了
Yes, but we don't have a liner this time , which means the chance is less And if we fail, we don't really have any hope

375
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,960
我们需要多久才能渴死?
How long do we need before we die of thirst?

376
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:13,640
真正让我困扰的是我们的水在那个袋子里是的，有飞行工具我们可以用它来求救我们可以用一个老式的消息让她飞到我们的旅馆
What really bothers me is that our water is down in that bag Yes, with the flying vehicle We could have used it to get help We could have flown her to our inn with an old-fashioned message

377
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:28,920
嘿，也许我能弄到你什么意思?我说它太滑了，没有脚趾是啊，但当我昨天把手机放下来的时候我觉得绳子够得着
Hey, maybe I can get it what do you mean? I said it's too smooth, no toe Yeah, but when I got my cell phone down yesterday I think the rope was long enough to reach

378
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,240
你是认真的吗?是的
are you serious? Yes

379
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,800
是啊，我觉得我能搞定
Yeah, I really think I can get it

380
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:51,880
亨特，我不认为这是个好主意贝基，我认为我们别无选择随着时间的流逝，我们越来越虚弱
Hunter, I don't think it's a good idea Becky, I don't think we have a choice With every passing hour, we get weaker

381
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,960
而且，你可能会走运摔下去
Besides, you might get lucky and fall

382
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,080
“猎人”
"Hunter"

383
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,640
小心
Be careful

384
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,520
对不起,胸大肌。
Sorry, Pecs.

385
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
我爱你
I love you

386
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,360
好吧
Well

387
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,640
亨特，你没事吧?
Hunter, are you okay?

388
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,000
是的是的，一切都很好
Yes Yes, it's all good

389
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,640
好吧
Well

390
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:26,720
亨特，小心点死我够不到上去，我们会把它带到低一点的地方来吧，死
Hunter, be careful Die I can't reach it Just go up, we'll get it to a lower elevation Come on Die

391
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,080
我想我可以把自己降低到一个更低的层次什么?
I think I can lower myself to a lower level What?

392
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,880
你在干什么，亨特?
What are you doing, Hunter?

393
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,720
“猎人”
"Hunter"

394
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,960
死
Die

395
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,160
我想我可以唱"亨特" "亨特"
I think I can swing to it "Hunter", la, "Hunter"

396
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,920
回来，亨特，不要叫"亨特"
come back here Hunter, no "Hunter"

397
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,280
你是好吗?
Are you well?

398
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,800
是的
Yes

399
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,680
有办法下车吗?
Is there a way to get off?

400
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,960
没有，梯子完全从她身上掉下来了
No, the ladder completely fell off her

401
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,400
水
Water

402
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,960
我的天等等，亨特。
My God Wait, Hunter.

403
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,200
你怎么才能回到绳子上呢?
How will you get back on the rope?

404
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,080
死
Die

405
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,880
你够得着吗?
Can you reach it?

406
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:10,520
我的上帝，矮胖子摔得那么重
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall My God Humpty Dumpty has fallen so hard

407
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,920
死
Die

408
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,480
你是好吗?
Are you well?

409

是的，我有一个主意
Yes, I have an idea

Well I'll try to link it to this Then we'll work together to pull me up, okay?

411
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,000

That's amazing, these are MacGyver-style things.

412

我差不多能走到楼梯了
I can almost reach the stairs

420
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,480
《山峰》几乎是我创作的
I almost originate "Peaks"

421
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,320
好吧

不，你还好吗?
No, are you okay?

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,040
我以为你死在那儿了我哪儿也不去，胸肌。
ArLionZ - By Mandooz I thought you died there I'm not going anywhere, Pecs.

429
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:30,000
是啊，太可怕了
Yeah, that was scary

430
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:38,319
我们得把它分成几份
We have to divide it into portions

431
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:42,359
里面有食物吗?
Is there food in it?

432
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:55,200
不，只是你的樱桃润唇膏我觉得你不能吃它好吧，天快黑了我觉得我们应该现在就用那个飞行器，否则永远都不用我觉得我们需要…我们需要写一条信息
No, it's just your cherry lip balm I don't think you can eat it Well, it's almost dark I think we should use that flying vehicle now or never I think we need... we need to write a message

433
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,760
餐厅的收据笔，你有笔吗?
Well, the receipt from the restaurant Pen, do you have a pen?

434
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,120

Eyeliner pencil for the eyes inside Aren't you glad I brought my makeup now?

435
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:15,480

看到这些?
Well See those?

437
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:28,200
这条我们差点出车祸的路通向青年旅社。只要有灯，我们就走吧
This road where we almost got into an accident leads to the hostel Let's do it as long as we have light

438
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,240
好吧
Well

439
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,600
好了，保持直线，顺着线走，让它顺着路走好了
Well, keep it straight and follow the line, let it flow and go down with the road Well

440
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,240
我们快过大门了-不不不-什么?
Well, we're almost past the gate - Oh, no, no, no - What?

441
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:04,160
-电池快没电了-该死按恢复键还是太远了?
- The battery is almost dead - Damn it Hit the restore button or is it too far away?

442
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:16,080
它会返回吗?你不可能确定吗?-连登机口都没有该死，倒下去按恢复键，按恢复键好了-它回来了-飞得高尽你所能把它找回来
Will it return? No way are you sure? - Not even at the gate damn, fall down Press the restore button, press the restore button Well - It's coming back - Fly it high Try your best to get it back to us

443

This is beautiful, great job

446

We have a charger, but we don't have power Maybe you should turn it off and when you rest, you will have more energy It will never be enough, Hunter.

447
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
我们该怎么办?
what shall we do?

448
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:16,840
我们不会惊慌我们会保持冷静我们会找到解决办法的一定会有办法的
We will not panic We will keep calm We will find a solution Well, there must be a way

449
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,840
我们会死吗?
Will we die?

450
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,360
不，不，我们会没事的
No, no, we'll be fine

451
