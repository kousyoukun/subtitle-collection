1
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,590
我的名字是詹姆斯·提比留斯·柯克
My name is Captain James Tiberius Kirk

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,870
星际联邦的舰长
of the United Federation of Planets.

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,430
我谨以弗比安共和国的中立代表身份
I am appearing before you as a neutral representative

4
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,190
前来面见诸位
of the Fibonan Republic.

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,830
我带来了友好信息
I bring you a message of goodwill

6
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,030
同时呈交尊贵的提纳克希议员团
and present to you esteemed members of the Teenaxi Delegation,

7
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,650
一份来自弗比安最高议会的礼物
a gift from the Fibonan High Council

8
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,030
并致以最高敬意
with the highest regard.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,710
它哪里坏了
What's wrong with it?

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
你说什么
Uh, excuse me?

11
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,350
他们干嘛不想再要了
Why don't they want it anymore?

12
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,590
呃 就是 这其实是一件古代的武器
Uh, well, this was once a piece of an ancient weapon,

13
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,670
现在他们把它当做象征 表
and now they offer it as a symbol of...

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,620
表示和平
Of peace.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,310
在弗比安的文化里
In the Fibonan culture,

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
交出武器就意味着 提议停战
to surrender a weapon is an offer of truce.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,150
他们怎么得到的
How did they come by it?

18
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,670
他们告诉我 他们很久以前就得到了
They told me they acquired it a long time ago.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,190
那就是偷来的
So they stole it, then.

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,270
不是 他们 好吧 我也不清楚
No, they, um... Well, I don't know.

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
你们不了解弗比安人 远不如我们
You don't know the Fibonans like we do!

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,450
是啊 你说的非常对 尊敬的阁下 这份礼物
Yeah, that's very true. Your Excellency, this gift...

23
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,070
他们就是一群不值得信赖的窃贼
They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,620
就想看到我们被砍死在自己的床上
who want to see us murdered in our own beds!

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,950
这件深受钟爱的礼物 它象征着信任与和平
This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace.

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,310
他们想把我们切成肉排 然后再放在火上烤
They want to chop us into pieces and roast us over a fire!

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
不 他们 我觉得不会那样
No, no... I don't think that's true.

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,750
再吃掉我们
And eat us!

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
什么
What?

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,910
斯科蒂 快把我弄回去
Scotty! Get me out of here!

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,710
- 快啊 - 斯科蒂
- That was quick. - Scotty!

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,940
地面上的干扰非常严重 长官
There's quite a bit of surface interference, sir.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,150
斯科蒂
Scotty!

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
快把它弄下来
Get it off of me!

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,310
又把我的制服撕破了
I ripped my shirt again.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,620
怎么样
How'd it go?

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,950
舰长 您和提纳克希人达成和平协议了吗
Captain, did you manage to broker a treaty with the Teenaxi?

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,310
噢 这么说吧 快谈到了
Uh... Let's just say I came up short.

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,730
你能 嗯 这个日志 把它锁资料库里
Will you, uh, log that and put it in the vault,

40
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,910
斯波克 谢谢
Spock? Thank you.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,670
吉姆 你看起来很狼狈
Jim, you look like crap.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
谢了 老骨头
Thank you, Bones.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,910
你太阳穴上的那个小血管又爆出来了 没事吧
You got that little vein popping out of your temple again. You okay?

44
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,600
从没这么好过 又是舰队里的一天罢了
Never better! Just another day in the fleet.

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,190
舰长日志 星历2263.2
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,590
今天是我们进入深太空的第966天
Today is our 966th day in deep space,

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,830
我们的五年任务也快到了第三年
a little under three years into our five-year mission.

48
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,310
在深空待的时间越长
The more time we spend out here,

49
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,230
就越来越难以分辨 今天何时结束
the harder it is to tell where one day ends

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,870
下一天何时开始
and the next one begins.

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,890
连脚踏实地的感觉也变成了挑战
It can be a challenge to feel grounded

52
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,030
因为重力也是人工制造的
when even gravity is artificial.

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,110
不过我们还是尽己所能 让它感觉像个家
But, well, we do what we can to make it feel like home.

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,110
不论延长的外太空逗留时间如何艰苦
The crew, as always, continues to act admirably

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,820
还是 要让他们必须做出的个人牺牲
despite the rigors of our extended stay here in outer space.

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,910
船员们都一如既往地延续着十分出色的表现
And the personal sacrifices they have made.

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,290
我们从未间断寻找新的生命形式
We continue to search for new life forms

58
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,470
是为了建立起牢固的外交关系
in order to establish firm diplomatic ties.

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,910
在星图未标绘的地域延长逗留时间
Our extended time in uncharted territory

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,270
考验着飞船的机械性能
has stretched the ship's mechanical capacities.

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,670
但幸运的是 我们的轮机工程部
But fortunately our engineering department,

62
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,830
在斯科蒂先生的率领下 完全能胜任工作
led by Mr. Scott, is more than up to the job.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,780
除了星舰 旷日持久的共居生活
The ship aside, prolonged cohabitation has

64
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,230
也已经对人际动力学产生了确实的影响
definitely had effects on interpersonal dynamics.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,540
有一些向好的方向发展
Some experiences for the better,

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,830
而另一些就越来越糟
and some for the worse.

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,900
至于我 开始觉得情况
As for me, things have started to

68
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,790
有一点儿 难以捉摸
feel a little episodic.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,230
我们走得越远 我就越发觉自己会去想
The farther out we go, the more I find myself wondering

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,430
我们究竟想努力达成什么
what it is we're trying to accomplish.

71
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,750
如果宇宙真的无边无际
If the universe is truly endless,

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,070
那么 我们难道不是在谋求永远无法企及的事吗
then are we not striving for something forever out of reach?

73
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,000
进取号将按照预定日程
The Enterprise is scheduled

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,670
到约克城基地进行补给
for a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,910
那是联邦最新也是最先进的星舰基地
the Federation's newest and most advanced starbase.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,350
也许离开日常工作 会提供一时喘息之机
Perhaps a break from routine will offer up some respite

77
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,110
暂别神秘的未知
from the mysteries of the unknown.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,250
上传至联邦档案资料库  源星球:未知
来源方:弗比安共和国
拒收方:提纳克希议员团

79
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,350
抱歉 来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

80
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,550
金瑟咳出了高浓度绿色黏性物质
Keenser's leaking some kind of highly acidic green goo,

81
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,100
斯科蒂就怕他对着曲速核咳嗽
and Scotty's terrified he's gonna sneeze on the warp core

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
那会要了我们的命
and kill us all.

83
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,710
你在喝什么什么玩意儿
What the hell are you drinking?

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,780
就是在瑟塞斯弄来的那瓶蜥蜴人的白兰地
Uh, I'm pretty sure it's the rest of that Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus.

85
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,350
天呐 老弟 你是想把自己喝瞎吗
My God, man, are you trying to go blind?

86
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,630
那东西是违法的
That stuff's illegal.

87
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,990
何况 我在契科夫的柜子里发现了这个
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
- 喔 - 对吧
- Wow. - Right?

89
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,150
我一直觉得他该是个
I mean, I always assumed he'd be

90
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,990
- 喝伏特加的好手 - 喝伏特加的好手 一点儿没错
- a vodka man. - A vodka guy, exactly.

91
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,110
我想给你的生日弄点像样的东西
I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday.

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,350
你还有几天 你知道我不太在乎这事儿
Uh, that's in a couple days. You know I don't care about that.

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,070
我知道 我知道你不太想庆祝生日
I know. I know you don't like celebrating it on the day

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,670
是因为那天你老爸化作了星尘
because it's also the day your pa bit the dust.

95
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,790
我的神经还算敏感
I was being sensitive.

96
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,790
他们教过你怎么对待别人吗 在医学院
Did they teach you about bedside manner in medical school?

97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,670
敬你那大脑的魅力
It's just your southern charm.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,790
- 噢 是啊 真不错 - 噢
- Oh, yeah. That's good. - Ooh.

99
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
好酒
Lordy!

100
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,510
给你妈妈打个电话
Are you gonna call your mom?

101
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,070
是啊 当然会了 那天再打给她
Yeah, of course. I'll call her on the day.

102
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,990
我又老了一岁
I'm one year older.

103
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,750
是啊 生日就这个意思
Yep, that's usually how it works.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,460
他永远也到不了我这个年纪了
A year older than he ever got to be.

105
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,390
他加入星际舰队 是因为
He joined Starfleet because he...

106
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,190
他有信仰
He believed in it.

107
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
而我是为了一个赌
I joined on a dare.

108
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,150
你加入是想让自己不要辜负他
You joined to see if you could live up to him.

109
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,550
是啊 那么久以来 你一直想成为乔治·柯克
Uh, you spent all this time trying to be George Kirk

110
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,910
可现在你却在想吉姆该是什么样
and now you're wondering just what it means to be Jim.

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,070
你为什么会在这里
Why you're out here.

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,510
耳聪目明 那一脑袋的头发
To perfect eyesight and a full head of hair.

113
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
我是柯克
Kirk here.

114
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,230
舰长 即将抵达约克城基地
Captain, approaching Yorktown base.

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,190
我马上过去 苏鲁先生
I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,510
生日的事儿先别说出去
Let's keep this birthday thing under wraps, huh?

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,230
你知道我的 敏感先生嘛
Yeah, you know me. Mr. Sensitive.

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,190
哇 真是太壮观了
Wow. That is impressive.

119
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,830
是啊 她是个美人儿 是不是
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?

120
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,910
真是个畸形的庞然大物
What a damn monstrosity!

121
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,430
就不能找个星球借点儿地方
Couldn't we just rent some space on a planet?

122
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,210
阐明地理上的偏好
Showing geographical favoritism

123
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,950
会在正式加入联邦世界中
among inducted Federation worlds

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
引发外交紧张
could cause diplomatic tension.

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
看着它就让人紧张
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

126
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,190
像个在太空里要爆掉的该死的雪花球
Looks like a damn snow globe in space just waiting to break!

127
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,590
就你会这么说 老骨头
Oh, that's the spirit, Bones.

128
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,030
斯波克
Spock!

129
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,350
现在有时间吗
Do you have a moment?

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,150
当然有 妮欧塔
Of course, Nyota.

131
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,630
我想你应该把它拿回去
I think you should have this back.

132
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
毕竟 它属于你母亲
After all, it belonged to your mother.

133
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,630
这并不符合瓦肯习俗
It's not in the Vulcan custom

134
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,750
重新接受已被送做礼物的东西
to receive again that which was given as a gift.

135
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
你俩分手了
You guys break up?

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
你干了什么
What'd you do?

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,710
一个典型的抽象提问 医生
A typically reductive inquiry, Doctor.

138
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
要知道 斯波克
You know, Spock,

139
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,070
如果地球的姑娘说 问题在我不在你
if an Earth girl says, uh, "It's me, not you,"

140
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,990
那你肯定有问题
it's definitely you.

141
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,190
打扰一下 斯波克中校
Excuse me. Commander Spock?

142
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,150
可以借用你一些时间吗
May we have a moment of your time?

143
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,590
这真是太棒了 你知道我还没来过这里吗
This is wonderful! You know I've never been here?

144
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,590
我觉得这里的酒吧全都一级棒
What I hear is that the bars here are excellent.

145
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,590
你们来了 我很高兴
I'm so glad you guys could come.

146
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,790
谢谢你们告知我这个消息
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

147
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,950
生生不息 繁荣昌盛
Live long and prosper.

148
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,470
生生不息 繁荣昌盛
Live long and prosper.

149
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,400
生于2230年6月  卒于2263年2月
斯波克大使

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,110
敌我级别警告 有飞船接近
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

151
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,750
非星联飞船
Unidentified. Non-Federation.

152
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,270
注意 不明身份飞船 你无授权接近
Attention, unidentified vessel. You are not authorized for approach.

153
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,270
关闭动力 等待指示
Power down and await instructions.

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,430
不明身份飞船 请服从指令
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

155
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,030
请用规范语言
Speak normally.

156
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,450
语言分析已经完成
Language analysis complete.

157
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,200

这个有用吗
Is this working?

160
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,950
我们在星云内部执行科学任务
We were on a science mission inside the nebula.

161
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,550
我们的飞船受到 发生了很严重的故障
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

162
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,470
我乘逃生舱出来
I took an escape pod

163
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,150
然后 飞船就坠毁在了临近的星球上
before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,830
我们需要一艘飞船 能够在星云内部航行
We need a ship capable of navigating the nebula.

165
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,430
你们必须找
You must have someone

166
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,470
能帮助我们的人
who can help us.

167
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,620
我们追踪到了受困飞船
We tracked her stranded ship

168
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,590
在一处尚未标绘的星云里
to a sector of uncharted nebula,

169
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,670
在210 标号14
here at 2-1-0 mark 14.

170
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,590
- 远程扫描呢 - 没有数据
- Uh, long-range scan? - No data.

171
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,710
星云过于稠密 那是未知的空域
The nebula is too dense. It's uncharted space.

172
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,510
进取号的确配备有星际舰队最好的导航系统
Well, the Enterprise does have the best navigational system in the fleet.

173
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
她能应付
She could handle it.

174
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,110
这里唯一一艘运用更先进技术的星舰
The only ship here with more advanced technology

175
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,390
还在建造当中
is still under construction.

176
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,510
但我派出去的 不只是星舰
But it's not just the ship that I'm sending.

177
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,550
- 我这就集结船员- 舰长
- I'll gather the crew. - Captain.

178
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,750
星际舰队指挥部
Starfleet command sent me your application

179
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,750
把你晋升中将的批复发给了我 你想在这里就职吗
for the Vice Admiral position here at this installation.

180
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,830
是的 长官
Yes, ma'am. Um...

181
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,710
如果可以 我
If I may, I would

182
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,320
更愿意推荐斯波克中校
recommend Commander Spock replace me

183
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,070
接替我担任进取号舰长
as Captain of the Enterprise.

184
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,710
他是星际舰队军官的楷模 也会是位好舰长
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer. He'd make a great captain.

185
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,700
这并非不寻常 你知道
It isn't uncommon, you know,

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,070
就算是想要离任的舰长
even for a captain, to want to leave.

187
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,990
在广袤无垠的太空里 不会有相对方向
There is no relative direction in the vastness of space.

188
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,310
那只有你自己
There is only yourself,

189
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,470
你的飞船 你的船员
your ship, your crew.

190
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,070
只会比你想的更容易迷失航向
It's easier than you think, to get lost.

191
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,240
- 不是因为 - 申请我会递交总理事会
- It's not about... - I'll bring it up with the General Council.

192
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,750
你回来后再做讨论
We'll discuss it when you return.

193
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,390
是 长官
Ma'am.

194
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,980
- 斯波克先生 - 舰长
- Mr. Spock. - Captain.

195
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,680
- 你现在 - 我在想
- I was thinking... - Perhaps there...

196
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,190
- 不 你先说 - 舰长 你先说
- No, please. - Captain, after you.

197
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,630
我坚持
I insist.

198
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,190
等执行完任务 我们 应该坐下来
After this mission, we should, uh, sit down.

199
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,170
我有些事情要跟你说
There's something I need to talk to you about.

200
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,910
我也有事要跟你分享
I as well have something to share.

201
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,390
我们是好伙伴 对吗
We make a good team. Right?

202
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,750
我想我们是的
I believe we do.

203
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
这次我坚持
I insist.

204
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,550
乌胡拉上尉 打开全舰广播
Lieutenant Uhura, open a ship-wide channel.

205
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,990
是 舰长
Yes, Captain.

206
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,550
进取号全体船员请注意
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

207
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,200
我们这次任务很明确
Our mission is straightforward.

208
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,750
前往营救困在一处未标绘空域行星上的船员
Rescue a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space.

209
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,760
航行轨迹将穿过一片不稳定的星云
Our trajectory will take us through an unstable nebula,

210
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,820
期间会失去与星际舰队的一切通讯联络
one which will disable all communications with Starfleet.

211
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,580
就只能靠自己了
We're gonna be on our own.

212
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,460
而进取号有舰队其它星舰没有的
The Enterprise has something no other ship in the fleet has,

213
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
就是各位
you.

214
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,350
也希望大家能明白
And as we've come to understand,

215
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,950
没有什么是未知的
there is no such thing as the unknown,

216
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,070
我们只是暂时藏起来
only the temporarily hidden.

217
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
通话完毕
Kirk out.

218
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,340
读数显示 云层的密度在减少 长官
Mmm. Readings indicate cloud density diminishing, sir.

219
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,190
这里是奥泰梅德 我的飞船就困在这里
This is Altamid. My ship is stranded here.

220
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,790
正在接近奥泰梅德
Approaching Altamid.

221
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,300
M级行星
Class-M planet.

222
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,470
有大量地下进化活动
Massive subterranean development.

223
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,510
但地表无生命形态
But limited to no life forms on the surface.

224
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
接近警报 长官
Proximity alert, sir!

225
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,280
有一艘不明飞船正朝我们过来
We have an unknown ship heading right for us.

226
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
- 乌胡拉中尉 呼叫他们 - 好的 舰长
- Lieutenant Uhura, hail them. - Yes, Captain.

227
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,630
没有回应 我监测到了某种信号
No response. I am picking up some kind of signal.

228
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,000
联系 失败

229
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,400
联系 未知

230
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,650
他们干扰我们的信号
They're jamming us.

231
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,110
把它放大 苏鲁先生
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

232
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,650
联系
[未知]

233
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,790
这是什么
What is this?

234
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,760
升起护盾 红色警戒
Shields up! Red alert!

235
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,470
全舰自由攻击
Fire at will.

236
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,230
长官 我们的相位炮只起到了很小的作用
Sir, our phasers are having minimal effect

237
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,470
鱼雷也没法跟踪它们的移动
and our torpedos can't track their movements!

238
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,870
所有武器全面开火
Fire everything we've got.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
舰长 我们的武器无法匹配这样的交战
Captain, we are not equipped for this manner of engagement.

240
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,410
护盾屏蔽已经失效 长官
Shield frequencies have no effect, sir!

241
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,310
主屏障已损毁 护盾无法操控了
They took out the dish! Shields are inoperable!

242
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,030
- 进曲速 快走 苏鲁先生 - 是 长官
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu. - Yes, sir.

243
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,490
我们怎么动都没动
Why the hell aren't we moving?

244
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,430
没法启动曲速驱动器 长官
I can't engage the warp drive, sir!

245
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,590
斯科蒂 我要曲速 马上
Scotty, I need warp now!

246
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,550
没法子 长官 曲速舱 它们
I cannae, sir! The nacelles, they've...

247
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,100
全没了
They've gone!

248
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,150
安全人员 启用所有应急规程
Security, engage all emergency procedures.

249
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,270
执行舰队安全协议28 准则代码1A0
Active protocol 28 Code One Alpha Zero.

250
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
所有人员进入警戒岗位
All personnel to alert stations.

251
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,990
长官 舰体出现破裂 12至15层
Sir, I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15,

252
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,070
6 9 31 21层都有 长官
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

253
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,650
舰长 我现在还能把存储的能量从曲速核
Captain! There's a chance I can reroute the energy reserves

254
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,310
接到脉冲引擎上
from the warp core to the impulse engines.

255
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
如果再回到星云里 就能甩掉它们
If we can get back into the nebula, maybe we could lose them.

256
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,390
尽管放手去做 斯科蒂
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

257
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,470
小不点儿 我们走
Wee man! Let's go.

258
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,530
清理完毕，克劳。

259
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,910
匹配等离子导管 听我命令准备变更
Fit the plasma conduits and stand by to reroute on my mark!

260
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,100
艾布纳塞到手了。

261
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,110
占领这艘飞船。

262
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,200
- 舰长 - 说 斯波克
- Captain. - Go, Spock.

263
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,560
我确认了
I have identified the individual

264
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,310
那个带领攻击小组的人
who appears to be leading the attack party.

265
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,410
他侵袭了资料库
He infiltrated the archive vault

266
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,670
拿走了我们要送给提纳克希人的那件武器
and removed the artifact from our mission on Teenax.

267
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,230
和他保持安全距离
Hold your distance until...

268
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
斯波克
Spock!

269
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
斯波克
Spock!

270
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,930
你们俩跟我走 苏鲁 由你来指挥
You two, with me. Sulu, you have the conn.

271
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
是 长官
Yes, sir.

272
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,470
我的天呐
My God.

273
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,600
临界警报

274
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
这是
What the hell?

275
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
医生
Doctor?

276
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,630
医生 我们必须马上撤离
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

277
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,670
柯克
Captain

278
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,030
舰长
Kirk.

279
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,750
好 我们的脉冲引擎动力100%
Yes! We are at 100% impulse.

280
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,230
干得漂亮 斯科蒂先生
Great work, Mr. Scott!

281
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,070
最大脉冲速度 进入星云
Maximum impulse towards the nebula.

282
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,460
是
Aye.

283
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,900
克劳，飞船掉头返航了！

284
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,690
切断它的喉咙。

285
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,780
柯克呼叫舰桥
Kirk to Bridge.

286
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,070
我们正在失去惯性阻尼器
We are losing the inertial dampeners!

287
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,160
全舰系统全部开始失效了 舰长
Systems are failing ship-wide, Captain.

288
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,230
正在封闭应急隔板
Emergency bulkheads are sealing,

289
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,790
可结构完整度只有18% 而且还在下降 长官
but structural integrity is at 18% and falling, sir!

290
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,670
全员弃船 苏鲁先生
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

291
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,390
鸣发警报
Sound the alarm.

292
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,950
全员弃船 所有人员请立即撤离
Abandon ship. All personnel.

293
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,040
我们必须给逃生舱创造机会
We need to give those pods a chance to escape.

294
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,670
你能把那些飞船引开吗
Can you lead those ships away?

295
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
脉冲引擎还在从曲速驱动器中接收能量
Impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve.

296
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,950
在碟部彻底分离以前我们不能动
We cannot move until the saucer is separated.

297
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,340
交给我来
I'll handle it.

298
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,070
遵命 长官
Aye-aye, sir.

299
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,670
全员弃船 所有人员请立即撤离
Abandon ship. All personnel evacuate immediately.

300
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,990
你没事吧 快帮帮我 把他扶起来
You okay? Oh, my God. Get him up. Help him up.

301
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
扶好了
Got you.

302
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,080
你们必须全部上逃生舱 快 快走
We've got to get you guys to an escape pod. Go.

303
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,540
快走 希尔少尉
Go! Ensign Syl.

304
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,110
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

305
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,510
好的 长官
Yes, sir.

306
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,190
我的老天
My God.

307
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,470
斯波克 他们把船员抓走了
Spock, they're taking the crew!

308
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,270
全员弃船 所有人员请立即撤离
Abandon ship. All personnel evacuate immediately.

309
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
你没事吧
Are you okay?

310
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,610
碟部应该分离完毕了
The saucer should be free by now!

311
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,230
我知道 苏鲁先生 舰长应该已经到了
I know, Mr. Sulu. The Captain should be there!

312
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,550
全员弃船 所有人员请立即撤离
All personnel evacuate immediately.

313
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
碟形部分分离
确认

314
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,470
脉冲引擎正在从辅助动力发生器获取能量
Impulse engines drawing power from auxiliary generators.

315
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,910
舰长
Captain!

316
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,190
碟部上面还有多少船员
How many of the crew are still aboard the saucer?

317
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,460
没有了
None.

318
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,870
如果我没有看错读数
But if I'm reading this correctly,

319
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,430
入侵者把船员都抓走了
the intruders are taking them.

320
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,150
舰长 我们被星球的重力捕获了
Captain, we are caught in the planet's gravity.

321
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,590
没有办法 逃脱了
We cannot pull away.

322
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,070
上凯尔文联络艇
Get to your Kelvin Pods.

323
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,350
- 明白 长官 - 是 舰长
- Yes, sir. - Aye, Captain.

324
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,990
快 我们走
Come on, let's go!

325
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
快走
Let's go.

326
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
快
Come on.

327
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
契科夫
Chekov!

328
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,150
你知道 你知道我们会受到攻击
You knew. You knew we'd be attacked.

329
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,680
你不明白
You don't understand.

330
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,230
舰长 柯克舰长
Captain! Captain Kirk!

331
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,510
是的 我骗了你们
Yes. I lied.

332
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,280
我们的飞船也受到了攻击
Our ship was attacked.

333
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,270
契科夫 查看信号 联络生还者
Chekov, check the comms for survivors.

334
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,750
- 是 是 是 先生 - 那人是谁
- Aye, Captain. - Who is he?

335
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,390
他的名字叫克劳
His name is Krall.

336
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,350
他抓走了我的船员 你的船员也一样
He took my crew. Like he took yours.

337
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,030
他怎么会对进取号那么了解
How did he know so much about the Enterprise?

338
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,790
我只知道如果我这样做
All I know is that if I did this,

339
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,550
他就会放了我的人
he would set them free.

340
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,510
契科夫 你在扫描仪上发现什么没有
Chekov, are you picking anything up on those scanners?

341
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,030
没有 长官
Nothing, sir.

342
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,950
- 他们会不会 - 不 不会
- What if they... - No, no.

343
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,780
是被带走了
He was taking them.

344
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,670
我们必须找到碟部
We have to find that saucer.

345
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,220
就算是最小的扫描系统
Even minimal scanning systems

346
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,070
也比三路仪的搜索范围大得多
will have more range than a tricorder.

347
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,550
是 舰长 这是有可能的
Aye, Captain, it's possible.

348
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,190
舰长
Captain.

349
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,990
我也是为了保护我的船员
I was protecting my crew.

350
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,570
我们正在寻找舰长。

351
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,260
你的名字是什么
What is your name?

352
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,350
你怎么懂我们的语言
How do you know our language?

353
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,870
我还懂你们的人
I know your kind.

354
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,590
我是联邦星舰进取号的妮欧塔·乌胡拉上尉
I am Lieutenant Nyota Uhura of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

355
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,910
你已经做出了对联邦的侵略行为
And you have committed an act of war against the...

356
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,470
星际联邦
Federation!

357
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,950
星际联邦才是侵略行为
Federation is an act of war.

358
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,910
是你攻击了我们
You attacked us.

359
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,880
你的舰长
Your captain...

360
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,390
为什么你要牺牲自己去救他
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

361
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,710
他也会这么做
He would have done the same.

362
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,550
要是他安全地逃离飞船 就会来救我们
And if he made it off of that ship, he will come for us.

363
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,630
正中我的下怀 乌胡拉上尉
I am counting on it, Lieutenant Uhura.

364
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,430
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

365
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
天呐 斯波克
My God, Spock.

366
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
天呐
God...

367
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,870
到这边坐下
Sit down over here.

368
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,310
好了 好了 坐下 慢点儿
Okay. Okay, sit. Easy.

369
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,150
好了
Okay.

370
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,700
你要 尽量放松 不会有事的
Now, just try and relax. You're gonna be okay.

371
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,030
你语气中的强迫乐观态度
The forced optimism in your voice suggests

372
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,330
表明你正在试图激发镇静的感知意识
that you are trying to elicit a sense of calm in order to...

373
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
那就不用马粪哄你了
I'll cut the horseshit.

374
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,830
医生 我并未看出马的排泄物
Doctor, I fail to see how excrement of any kind

375
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,510
与我们的当前状况有任何关联
bears relevance on our current situation.

376
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,770
你干什么
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
必须离开 医生
We must keep moving, Doctor.

378
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,880
斯波克 这玩意儿穿进了你的腹部
Spock, this thing's punctured your iliac region!

379
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,960
时间是决定性要素
Time is a critical factor.

380
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,720
这话我正想告诉你
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.

381
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,750
听着 要是不取出来 你就没命了
Look, if I can't take this out, you're gonna die.

382
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,560
懂了 即便能取出来但止不住血 你也没命了
Okay? If I take it out and can't stop the bleeding, you're gonna die.

383
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,830
任一选项 其结果均无从上诉
I can see no appeal in either option.

384
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,750
是啊 不管信不信 我有同感
Believe it or not, neither can I.

385
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,750
那么 如果我记得正确的话
So, if I remember correctly,

386
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,230
瓦肯人的心脏应该在 对应人类的肝脏部位
the Vulcans have their hearts where humans have their livers.

387
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,990
很正确 医生
That is correct, Doctor.

388
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,390
这就是你 为什么这么冷漠
That explains a thing or two.

389
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,590
知道吗 你真走运 再往左一英寸
You know, you're lucky. An inch to the left...

390
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,350
你就没命了
And you'd be dead already.

391
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,310
我就不明白了 斯波克
I just don't get it, Spock.

392
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,910
我说他们 干嘛攻击我们
I mean, what did they attack us for?

393
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,310
我是说 大动干戈
I mean, they do all this for some

394
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,550
就为了连那些小动物都不要的那些小玩意儿
doodad that the tiny critters didn't want?

395
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,030
轻视单纯无法理解的事物
It is unwise to trivialize

396
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,860
并不明智 医生
that which one simply does not understand, Doctor.

397
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,550
不妨谨慎地假设 它比小玩意儿更为重要
We can safely assume it is more important than a doodad.

398
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,710
你成功地羞辱了我两次 斯波克
I think you just managed to insult me twice, Spock.

399
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
好了
Okay.

400
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,430
好了 斯波克 我就剩一个问题
All right, Spock, I just got one question.

401
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,840
- 你最喜欢 什么颜色 - 我并未看出颜色与
- What's your favorite color? - I fail to see the relevance.

402
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,070
是啊 他们说出其不意就没那么疼了
Yeah. They say it hurts less if it's a surprise.

403
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,510
如果可以采取你所熟悉的用语
If I may adopt a parlance with which you are familiar,

404
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,910
我可以把你的理论确认为 马粪
I can confirm your theory to be horseshit.

405
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,270
得赶紧离开这儿
We got to get out of here.

406
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
走吧
Come on.

407
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,120
逗我玩呢 你啊
You're kidding me, aren't you?

408
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,460
你们好
Hello there.

409
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
我叫蒙哥马利·斯科特
My name is Montgomery Scott.

410
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,030
那么 你们是谁
And, uh, who might you be?

411
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,900
看着点儿 小子
Watch it, sonny.

412
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,870
我可有用得很 但得我愿意 懂吗
I'm pretty handy when I want to be, all right?

413
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,190
别再来了
Don't come back!

414
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,750
这下让他们见识了 小姑娘
We certainly showed them, eh, lassie?

415
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,150
那归星际舰队所有 不能想拿就拿
That's Starfleet property, okay. You cannae just take it.

416
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,830
不过 今天我挺大方的 你就留着吧
Uh, but I'm feeling generous today, so have at it.

417
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,030
那个 哪里找到的
Where you get that?

418
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,920
- 你会说我们的话 - 在我房子里学的
- Is that English? - I learn it from my house.

419
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,940
哪里找到的
Where you get that?

420
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,000
是我的星际舰队徽章
It's my Starfleet insignia.

421
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
这什么意思
What does it mean?

422
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,150
意思就是 我是星际舰队的一名官员
Means that I'm an officer of Starfleet.

423
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,270
这是轮机工程部
Uh, engineering division.

424
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
轮机工程部
Engineering?

425
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,190
对 说得对 我修东西
That's right. I fix things.

426
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,800
我知道什么是轮机工程部
I know what is engineering.

427
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,560
想消灭我飞船的混蛋 你们不是一伙的吧
You're not with those bastards that killed my ship, are you?

428
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,910
我就当不是了
I'll take that as a no.

429
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,510
他叫克劳 他和他的
He is Krall. Him and his

430
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,340
蜜蜂
bees.

431
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,070
他们搜索行星要找 致命武器
They search the stars for a death machine.

432
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,220
他们就是你在这里的原因
They're the reason why you here.

433
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,470
我们都在这里的原因
Why we are all here.

434
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,230
什么 那三个讨厌鬼也是
Even those three scunners?

435
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,670
他们从天上掉下来 就像我和你
They have fallen from the sky, like me and you.

436
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,910
你跟我走 现在
Come with me. Now!

437
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,970
等等 我说等一下 小姑娘
Wait, no... Hang on a minute, lassie.

438
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,240
我今天碰上的事儿真不少
I'm having a difficult day here.

439
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,270
我必须要找到我的船员
I've got to find my crewmates.

440
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,950
我会帮你找到你的船员
I will help you find your mates.

441
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,750
然后你就要帮助我
And then you will help me.

442
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
要怎么帮
With what?

443
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,580
你想让我修东西
You want me to fix something?

444
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,270
是的 你帮我 我就帮你
Yes. You help me, and I help you.

445
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,170
那好吧 既然都已经这样了
All right, well, things being as they are,

446
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,910
说不准会有个好待遇
I doubt I'll get a better offer today,

447
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,660
那就 带路吧
so, lead the way.

448
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,060
很好
Good.

449
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,750
我是婕拉
I am Jaylah.

450
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,630
你是蒙哥马利·斯科特
And you are Montgomery Scott.

451
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,270
是 你可以叫我斯科蒂
Aye, Scotty.

452
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,430
快走吧 蒙哥马利·斯科蒂
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

453
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,100
好嘞 等等我
All right, hold up.

454
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,710
是进取号
The Enterprise.

455
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,710
它可能都没法把能量输送到舰桥了 舰长
She may not even have power to the Bridge, Captain.

456
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,350
她肯定还有其它的招数
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

457
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,830
我敢打赌
I'd bet on it.

458
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,350
麦考伊呼叫进取号 请回答
McCoy to Enterprise. Come in.

459
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,870
麦考伊呼叫进取号
McCoy to Enterprise.

460
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,870
嗨 你得走慢点儿 斯波克
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.

461
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,830
刚才那只是临时处置
That was just a temporary fix back there.

462
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,110
我明白 医生
I understand, Doctor.

463
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,190
有意思
Fascinating.

464
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,580
不吉利 黑暗 还有危险
Ominous. Dark. Dangerous.

465
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,110
我们进去
We're going in.

466
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,970
耐人寻味
Intriguing.

467
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,990
这些符号与在袭击中
These symbols are the same as those

468
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,310
被劫的武器上的符号一致
depicted on the artifact taken in the attack.

469
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,310
你觉得它来源于这儿
You think it came from here?

470
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,870
看来如此
It would seem so.

471
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,340
见鬼 斯波克
Damn it, Spock.

472
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,630
放松 放松
Easy. Easy.

473
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,190
快点儿
Hurry.

474
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,680
到了没有
Are we there yet?

475
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,800
不要再问了
Stop asking that.

476
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,950
对不起
Sorry.

477
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,540
跟着我走
This is the way. Come.

478
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,710
当心脚底下 你肯定不想踩到我的陷阱
And watch your steps. You do not want to set off my traps.

479
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,110
噢 可真聪明
Oh. That's clever.

480
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,430
这是什么地方
What is this place?

481
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,950
这是我的房子
This is my house.

482
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:25,950
你的房子
Your house?

483
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,630
稍等一下 这不是飞船吗
Hold on a minute. Is this a ship?

484
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,430
我帮你找到你的朋友 然后你帮我修好它
I help you find your friends and you help me fix it.

485
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,710
我就能永远离开这个星球了
So I can leave this planet forever.

486
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,950
你 等一下 这是你的飞船
Wait a minute. Is this your ship?

487
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,990
不 蒙哥马利·斯科蒂
No, Montgomery Scotty.

488
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,950
是你们的飞船
It's yours.

489
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,710
我的老天呐
Oh, my good Lord.

490
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,400
星际联邦 富兰克林号
星舰代码NX326

491
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,300
舰长 看起来还有能量
Captain, it looks like there is power.

492
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,350
好的 我们去舰桥再搜索船员
All right, let's get to the Bridge and find the crew.

493
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,470
控制台没有受损 舰长
The console is intact, Captain.

494
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,350
我重新布线 把能量接过来
I will try to reroute power to it.

495
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
快一点儿
Work fast.

496
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,040
一旦把这里弄亮 就会引来很多的敌人
Once we get this place lit up, we're gonna draw a lot of attention.

497
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,290
你觉得呢 能找到他们吗
What do you think, can you find them?

498
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,460
是 舰长
Aye, Captain.

499
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,810
我正在重新配置扫描器
I am reconfiguring scanners to modulate

500
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,100
调整到搜索船员的频率
for the crew's signals.

501
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,070
你跟我来 我还有东西没拿
You're with me. I left something behind.

502
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,120
金瑟确实够厉害的
That is one heck of a cold.

503
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,750
干得漂亮 金瑟
Nice job, Keenser.

504
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,160
好了 在下一次轮班之前我们大概有15分钟
All right, we got about 15 minutes until the next guard rotation. Come on.

505
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,350
快走 快来
Let's go. Come on.

506
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,940
快点儿
Come on.

507
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,390
这是麦哲伦探测器
This is the Magellan Probe.

508
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,990
联邦就是用它找到了穿过星云的航线
The Federation was using these to find a way through the nebula.

509
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,310
它有什么用
What's he using it for?

510
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
那边有什么
What do you see?

511
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,140
他在探测器之间架设了亚空间通讯链接
He's been piggybacking the subspace links between the probes.

512
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,670
我们能用它发求救信号吗
Can we use it to send a distress signal?

513
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,470
我来试试
I can try.

514
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,600

安全连接已建立

515
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,550
访问中
安全连接已建立

516
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,990
发出去了
It's sent.

517
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,230
他曾访问过约克城基地的数据库
He's accessed the Yorktown database.

518
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
什么
What?

519
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,190
还有星际舰队的数据文件 星舰的日志
He's got Starfleet data files, ship logs,

520
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,310
也包括进取号的
including the Enterprise.

521
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,990
原来他一直在监视我们
He's been watching us this whole time.

522
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,710
舰长
Captain,

523
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,030
那件武器始终都藏在星舰上吗
the artifact was on the ship the whole time?

524
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,780
带着它被抓 我承担不起那么大的责任
I couldn't afford to get caught with it,

525
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,910
所以就藏在这儿了
so I hid it in here.

526
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,310
告诉克劳 我拿到艾布纳塞了
Tell Krall I have the Abronath.

527
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,500
只要听到悲伤的故事 你都会相信
Do you believe every sad story you hear?

528
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,430
也不全是
Not every.

529
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,710
你把枪放下
Put the phaser down.

530
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
请吧
Please.

531
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,310
找到船员了吗 契科夫
You get it, Chekov?

532
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,350
是的 舰长 我追踪到了刚才通讯的位置
Aye, Captain, I have traced the location of her call.

533
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,120
克劳要这东西干什么
What does Krall want with this thing?

534
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,520
解救你们
To save you

535
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,190
别被自己消灭
from yourselves.

536
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,620
长官
Captain!

537
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,670
- 你没事吧 - 是的 舰长
- You all right? - Aye, Captain,

538
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,550
可我们被困住了
but we are trapped!

539
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,680
驱动器你能启动吗
Can you get this thing started?

540
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,070
你是说现在我们应该 发动推进器吗
Are you intimating that we should engage the thrusters?

541
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,830
那你还有其它办法吗
I am open to other suggestions.

542
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,870
好吧
Okay.

543
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,270
- 不过有个问题 先生 - 什么
- There is a problem. - What?

544
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,820
燃料倒是准备好了 可我没法让它燃烧起来
The fuel is primed, but I cannot get it to combust.

545
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,150
舰长 我们几乎就是站在一个非常大的炸弹上
Oy, Captain, we are basically standing on a very large bomb.

546
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,610
如果您没打到燃烧压缩机 舰长
If you miss the combustion compressor...

547
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,690
我不会的 行了
I'm not gonna miss, come on.

548
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,890
您知道燃烧压缩机长什么样吗
Do you even know what the combustion compressor looks like?

549
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,270
呃 是方的 对吗
It's square, right?

550
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,060
不对 舰长 是圆的
No, sir, it's round.

551
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,910
我刚才就那么说的
That's what I said.

552
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,830
跑
Run!

553
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,230
跳
Go!

554
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,830
契科夫
Chekov!

555
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,510
契科夫 跑
Chekov! Move!

556
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,350
你们以为自己知道
You think you know

557
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,910
牺牲的真正意义
what sacrifice really means?

558
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,930
星际联邦只会教你
Federation has taught you

559
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,270
冲突不应该存在
that conflict should not exist.

560
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,430
但是没有抗争
But without struggle,

561
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,430
你就永远不会了解真实的自己
you would never know who you truly are.

562
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,590
你根本不懂我们
You have no idea who we are.

563
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,630
但你很快就会明白
But you'll soon find out.

564
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,210
你说的是那个求救信号
You mean the distress signal

565
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,110
你们以为发送出去了
you thought you sent?

566
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,070
坐标被修改了
The coordinates were altered.

567
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,510
你们的救援飞船会被困在那片星云里
Your rescue ships will be stranded in the nebula

568
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,110
剩下你们的基地脆弱无防
and your base left vulnerable.

569
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,790
你要袭击约克城基地
You're going to attack Yorktown.

570
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,930
星际联邦所属的
Millions of souls

571
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,310
每一个世界 数百万人聚集在那里
from every Federation world holding hands.

572
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,630
一个完美的目标
It's a perfect target.

573
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,310
你错了 那是团结一致的力量
You're wrong. There is strength in unity.

574
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,830
这些其它人的力量 上尉
The strength of others, Lieutenant,

575
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,540
才让我继续生存下去
is what has kept me alive.

576
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,060
不
No!

577
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,420
斯波克
Spock.

578
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,350
斯波克 醒醒 见鬼
Spock, wake up, damn it!

579
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,550
我的意识很完整 医生
I am entirely conscious, Doctor.

580
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,350
我只是在沉思死亡的自然现象
I'm simply contemplating the nature of mortality.

581
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,670
感受哲学时的泰然自若 嗯
Feeling philosophical, huh?

582
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,190
我看你是大量失血才会这样的
Massive blood loss will do that to you.

583
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,310
你问过我乌胡拉上尉和我为何会分开
You asked me why Lieutenant Uhura and I parted ways.

584
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,240
是我有顾虑
I became concerned,

585
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,670
鉴于瓦肯星的消逝
in the light of Vulcan's demise,

586
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,870
我对自己的种族依然亏欠责任
that I owed a debt of duty to my species.

587
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,070
你觉得你应该去建设新瓦肯星 嗯
You thought you should be off making little Vulcans, huh?

588
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,910
是啊 能看出来这对她打击有多大
Yeah, I can see how that would upset her.

589
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,070
我本打算深入跟她讨论这件事
I intended to discuss it with her further,

590
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,270
但却收到一个对我产生了意外影响的消息
but I received some news which affected me unexpectedly.

591
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,230
什么消息
What news?

592
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,430
斯波克大使去世了
Ambassador Spock has died.

593
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,750
噢
Oh.

594
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,670
斯波克 真的很遗憾
Spock, I'm so sorry.

595
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,750
我可能没法想象 你现在的感受
I can't imagine what that must feel like.

596
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,270
像他那样经历过那么多的岁月
When you've lived as many lives as he,

597
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,030
畏惧死亡并不符合逻辑
fear of death is illogical.

598
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,110
畏惧死亡
Fear of death

599
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,790
才能继续生存下去
is what keeps us alive.

600
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,950
我想过他那样的一生
I want to live as he did.

601
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,310
所以我决定
That is why I decided

602
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,230
重新确定我努力的方向 继续他的工作
to redirect my efforts and continue his work

603
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,280
去新瓦肯星
on New Vulcan.

604
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,070
你要离开星际舰队
You're leaving Starfleet?

605
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,390
吉姆对这事儿怎么说
What did Jim have to say about that?

606
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,630
我还没找到时间 去告诉他
I could not find the time to tell him.

607
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,310
那我告诉你 他不会乐意的
Well, I can tell you he's not gonna like that.

608
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,590
见鬼 他要是没了你该怎么办
Hell, I don't know what he'd do without you.

609
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,230
我是说 要知道我已经安排了派对 不过
I mean, me on the other hand, I'd throw a party, but...

610
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,830
上帝 你这是犯糊涂了
My God, you're getting delirious.

611
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,270
离那个信号的坐标位置还有多远
How far are we from the coordinates of that call?

612
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,270
还很远呢 舰长
Still a ways, sir.

613
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,960
- 舰长 - 说吧
- Captain? - Yeah.

614
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,190
您是什么时候开始怀疑她的
When did you begin to suspect her?

615
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,670
还是不够早
Not soon enough.

616
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,790
您怎么发现的
How did you know?

617
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,240
我想说
Well...

618
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,910
你可以说我的好鼻子能嗅到危险
I guess you could say I've got a good nose for danger.

619
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,980
跑
Run!

620
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,430
那是音乐吗
Is that music?

621
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,270
到底从哪儿飘出来的
Where on earth is that coming from?

622
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
那里
There.

623
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,990
我把那个小盒子接到电源上
I plugged the little box in the power cell

624
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,110
然后那个小嘴唱歌了
and the little mouths make it sing.

625
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,790
真是非常聪明
That's very clever.

626
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,990
我对音乐的品味有点儿老派
Music's a bit old-fashioned for my taste,

627
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,720
更何况这些又吵 又会分心的音乐了
not to mention very loud and distracting,

628
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,390
不过也挺不错
but, aye, well played.

629
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,790
我喜欢有鼓点儿的节奏和喊叫
I like the beats and shouting.

630
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,500
是吗
Oh, you do?

631
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,430
- 关掉吧 - 没关系
- Switch it off. - Ach, you're okay.

632
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,230
快关掉
Switch it off!

633
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,230
有人踩到了我的陷阱
Someone set off one of my traps.

634
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,030
嘘
Shh.

635
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,980
是舰长
Captain?

636
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,630
- 你认识这两个人 - 是啊 小姑娘
- You know these men? - Aye, lassie.

637
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,030
- 那个小不点儿 就是帕维尔·契科夫 - 你好
- That wee man there is Pavel Chekov. - Hello.

638
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,470
那边帅气的混球 就是詹姆斯·T·柯克
And that handsome bastard is James T. Kirk.

639
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,820
都是我朋友
They're my mates.

640
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,030
看见你真高兴 长官
It's good to see you, sir.

641
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,470
她要干嘛 斯科蒂
What is she doing, Scotty?

642
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,140
请你不要伤害他们 因为如果你
Don't hurt them. No, don't!

643
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,750
这是什么鬼
Hit her!

644
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,050
你自由了 詹姆斯·T
You're free, James T.

645
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:15,950
起来吧
There we go.

646
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
斯科蒂先生
Mr. Scott.

647
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,350
这位新朋友是谁啊
Who's your new friend here?

648
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,770
还知道铺迎宾毯盛情款待
She sure knows how to throw out a welcome mat.

649
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,700
这位是婕拉
This is Jaylah.

650
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,320
我不知道什么事是迎宾毯
I do not know what is a welcome mat.

651
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,640
- 找到其他人了吗 - 没有 长官
- You find anybody else? - No, sir.

652
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,950
对不起 就只有你们俩
I'm sorry, you're the only ones.

653
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,330
进取号上到底出了什么事情 干嘛攻击我们
What the hell happened up there, Jim? Why were we attacked?

654
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,640
是为了我们从提纳克希带回来的那件武器
They were after the artifact we brought back from T eenax.

655
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
- 他们抢走了 - 没有
- Did they get it? - No.

656
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
- 那你拿走了 - 没有
- Have you got it? - No.

657
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,360
已经转移走了 放在了联络艇里
I had to get it off the Enterprise, put it on a shuttle.

658
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,390
- 把它藏在了联络艇 - 对
- You hid it in a shuttle. - Yes.

659
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,100
也不对
And no.

660
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,430
这是联邦星舰富兰克林号 长官 您能相信吗
This is the U. S. S. Franklin, sir. Can you believe it?

661
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,750
地球第一艘具备曲速4能力的星舰
First Earth ship capable of warp 4.

662
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,870
二十二世纪60年代早期在加加林辐射带失踪
Went missing in the Gagarin Radiation Belt in the early 2160s.

663
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,450
我记得在星舰学院听说过
I remember that from the Academy.

664
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,030
- 巴尔萨泽·爱迪生是舰长 - 是的
- Captain Balthazar Edison. - Aye.

665
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,030
舰队的早期英雄之一
One of the first heroes of Starfleet.

666
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,910
他的飞船怎么会落到这里
How the hell did his ship end up here?

667
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,310
说法就多了 长官
There's a lot of theories, sir.

668
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,830
比如向罗慕伦人投降
Surrendered to the Romulans.

669
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,670
被一只巨大的绿色太空手抓住
Captured by a giant green space hand.

670
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,990
落到这么远的地方 很有可能是被卷进了虫洞
This far out, it's got to be a wormhole displacement.

671
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,220
她还能飞吗
Can she fly?

672
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,790
她少了几个驱动器线圈
She's missing a few driver coils

673
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,270
少了几个电等离子系统导管
and the EPS conduits are fried,

674
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,350
不过婕拉做了了不起的工作
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job

675
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,390
让飞船的系统上线了
of getting the ship's systems back online.

676
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,290
谢谢 蒙哥马利·斯科蒂
Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.

677
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,830
噢 对不起
Pardon me.

678
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,150
契科夫先生 把坐标输进去
Mr. Chekov, can you plug in the coordinates.

679
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,840
看看飞船的传感器能否追踪到船员们的位置
See if you can track the crew's location from the ship's sensors.

680
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,070
是 舰长
Aye, Captain.

681
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,090
- 他喜欢那个座椅 - 斯科特先生
- He likes that seat. - Mr. Scott.

682
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,750
- 巡视一下 - 好的 去餐厅
- Tour. - Yes, the mess hall.

683
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,870
- 婕拉 你愿意的话 - 好的
- Jaylah, if you will. - Yes.

684
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,310
当时没有这些船员的消息吧
No clue what happened to the crew, huh?

685
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,140
没有 长官 到现在他们死了有一百年了
No, sir. They'd be dead a hundred years by now.

686
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,540
难道那是
Is that a...

687
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,030
这是PX-70
That's a PX70!

688
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,900
喔
Wow.

689
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,070
我爸小的时候就有一辆
My dad used to have one when he was a kid.

690
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,480
我妈说我爸把她放在后座上玩命地开
My mom said he'd put her on the back of it,

691
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,420
吓坏她了
drive her nuts.

692
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
长官
Sir.

693
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,120
呃
Um...

694
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,390
你是想告诉我它一直躺在这里
So you're telling me this thing's been here this whole time

695
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,640
从来没人动过
and no one's ever noticed it?

696
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,590
她装好了图像折射器
She's rigged up image refractors.

697
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,120
那儿 这儿
There. Here.

698
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,350
那 就像在用全息技术进行伪装
So, like some sort of holographic camouflage.

699
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,860
是的 长官
Aye, sir.

700
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,020
舰长
Captain!

701
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,310
我拦截到一个微弱的 通讯传输信号 舰长
I have intercepted a weak communications transmission, sir.

702
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,750
是星际舰队的频率
It's a Starfleet frequency.

703
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,400
传输检测

704
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,790
能锁定信号位置吗
Can you lock on to the signal?

705
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,990
能 可怎么去救他们呢
Yes, but how do we get to them?

706
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,060
我有个办法 长官
I have an idea, sir.

707
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
不过 一定得您准许
But I'm gonna need your permission.

708
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,010
为什么非得我准许
Why would you need my permission?

709
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,130
因为要是我搞砸了
Because if I mess it up,

710
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:32,710
我不想只是我一个人的错
I don't want it to be just my fault.

711
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,270
麦考伊 斯波克 呼叫进取号船员 回答
McCoy and Spock to Enterprise crew. Come in, Enterprise crew.

712
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,190
进取号船员
Anyone.

713
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,350
走吧 斯波克
Come on, Spock.

714
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,990
别泄气 你能行的
Come on, you can make it.

715
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,960
把我留下来
Leaving me behind

716
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,870
能显著增加你的生存机率 医生
will significantly increase your chances of survival, Doctor.

717
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,330
是 你倒还仗义
Well, that's damn chivalrous of you,

718
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,570
不过这事儿你想都别想
but completely out of the question.

719
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,750
你会找到其他生还的船员 这是必然的
It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew.

720
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,510
还以为你在乎的是我呢
And here I was thinking you cared.

721
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,150
我当然在乎你了
Of course I care, Leonard.

722
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,590
我始终认为 我对你的尊重很明确
I always assumed my respect for you was clear.

723
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,550
我们之间的谈话 这些年一直
The dialogue we have had across the years has always...

724
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,860
没关系 斯波克
It's okay, Spock.

725
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,390
用不着非说出来
You don't have to say it.

726
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,790
至少我不会孤独地死去
Well, at least I won't die alone.

727
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,550
此人真是堪称典范
Well, that's just typical.

728
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,590
都来啊 一群龟孙子
Come on, you bastards!

729
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,180
噢 天呐
Oh.

730
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,010
真高兴你没散架 医生
Good to see you in one piece, Doctor.

731
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,180
我吗
Oh, am I?

732
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,680
感觉内脏像在谷仓里跳舞
I feel like my innards have been to a barn dance!

733
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,330
是啊 这些老传送器原来只传送货物
Aye, well, these old transporters were only ever used for cargo,

734
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,120
不过 做些改装 似乎能传人了
but a few modifications seem to do the trick.

735
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,200
我想最好一次还是只传一个
I thought it best to beam you one at a time, though.

736
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,550
怕万一 你俩粘一块儿
You know, in case you got spliced.

737
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,200
我想不到还有更糟的情境了
I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

738
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,370
很高兴你回来了 还好吧
Good to have you back. You all right?

739
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,670
是 我很好 他受伤了
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

740
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,630
我的身体机能可以胜任 舰长
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

741
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,830
睁眼说瞎话
In a pig's eye, you are!

742
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,950
舰长 我们发现我们得到的武器
Captain, we discovered that the stolen artifact

743
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,240
似乎来自于这颗行星
appears to have come from this planet.

744
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,600
真见鬼 斯波克
Damn it, Spock.

745
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,210
这地方连点医疗用品也没有吗
Are there any medical supplies on this thing?

746
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,240
在这边
This way.

747
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,350
好 躺下 来吧
All right. Lie down. Come on.

748
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,390
就这样躺好了
There you go.

749
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,330
我们这次该怎么办 斯波克
How are we gonna get out of this one, Spock?

750
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,370
我们 没有飞船 没有船员
We've got no ship, no crew.

751
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,670
几乎没有胜算
Not the best odds.

752
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,360
那就遵循我们一直做的 吉姆
We will do what we have always done, Jim.

753
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,750
在不可能之中找寻希望
We will find hope in the impossible.

754
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,290
好吧 先帮你包扎
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

755
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
不 舰长
No, Captain.

756
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,600
你必须把精力专注于帮助船员
You must focus your efforts on helping the crew.

757
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,750
所以我才需要你在我身边 斯波克
Well, that's why I need you around, Spock.

758
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,680
这些东西从黑暗时代来的
These things are from the dark ages.

759
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,470
老骨头
Bones.

760
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,470
我很肯定这是原生质修复器
I'm pretty sure this is a protoplaser.

761
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,550
应该能止住大量内出血的
Should stop the internal hemorrhaging.

762
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,990
至少我是这么希望
At least that's my hope.

763
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,830
解救苦难 并无其它良药 唯有希望
"The miserable have no other medicine But only hope."

764
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,630
都到死神门口了 他还引用莎士比亚
Death's door and he's quoting Shakespeare.

765
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,510
舰长日志 星历2263.18
Captain's Log, Stardate 2262.18.

766
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,350
任务是 进取号将例行调查
The mission, routine investigation...

767
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,760
我们找遍了飞船残骸，没有发现。一定藏在别处。

768
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,370
我们只抓住了他的船员，克劳。

769
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,650
如果宇宙真的无边无际
If the universe is truly endless...

770
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,550
对我来说 两年前看似清晰
What seemed so clear to me two years ago now seems,

771
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,470
现在 似乎又遥不可及
well, far away.

772
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,830
你会告诉我东西在哪儿
You will tell me where it is!

773
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,160
现在
Now!

774
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,520
住手 住手
Stop! Stop!

775
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,360
放过他 我就把你要的给你
Let him go and I will give you what you want!

776
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,830
不 希尔 不要
No! Syl, don't!

777
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,110
上尉 团结一致 不是你们的力量
Lieutenant, unity is not your strength.

778
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,430
它是 你们的弱点
It is your weakness.

779
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,910
应该等等 等到有绝对把握
We should wait until we're absolutely sure.

780
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,430
不行 必须现在就把船员救出来
No, we have to get the crew back now.

781
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,180
契科夫有准确的坐标
Chekov has the coordinates

782
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,880
能让我们找到他的老巢
that can lead us to Krall's base, so we go!

783
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,410
我们怎么知道卡拉莱联络他的时候
With respect, sir, how do we know that Krall was at the base

784
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,500
克劳是在老巢
when she called him?

785
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,110
就算他在那儿
Even if he was,

786
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,570
可我们也不知道船员在不在那儿
we don't know that the crew is even with him.

787
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,610
说不定他们都还活着
Or if they're even still alive.

788
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,750
契科夫先生 你可以重新设置搜索参数
Mr. Chekov, can you reconfigure the search parameters

789
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,140
来对这个公式进行补偿吗
in order to compensate for this formula?

790
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,910
是 中校 可是这是什么公式
Aye, Commander, but what is this formula?

791
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,430
这是瓦卡雅 契科夫先生
It is Vokaya, Mr. Chekov.

792
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,090
一种独特的瓦肯矿石
A mineral unique to Vulcan

793
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,480
可发射低能量级辐射
which emits low-level radiation.

794
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,430
那我就把其它所有能量辐射都过滤掉
I will have to filter out all other energy emissions.

795
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,450
斯波克 一块瓦肯矿石到底要怎么帮我们出去
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan mineral be doing way out here?

796
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,790
告诉我们 这个是
Where are you going with this?

797
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,670
乌胡拉上尉戴着一个瓦卡雅护身符
Lieutenant Uhura wears a Vokaya amulet

798
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,350
是我赠与她的 象征感情和尊重
which I presented to her as a token of my affection and respect.

799
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,310
你送女朋友的珠宝有放射性
You gave your girlfriend radioactive jewelry?

800
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,770
辐射量对人无害 医生
The emission is harmless, Doctor.

801
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,100
但其独特的信号使之非常容易辨别
But its unique signature makes it very easy to identify.

802
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,350
你给女朋友送了一个跟踪装置
You gave your girlfriend a tracking device.

803
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,700
那并非我的本意
That was not my intention.

804
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,510
好吧 我很高兴他不尊重我
I'm glad he doesn't respect me.

805
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,710
我检测到了一个极其微弱的瓦卡雅信号
I am detecting a very trace amount of Vokaya.

806
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,710
是否与你从卡拉莱那里获得的坐标相匹配
Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalara,

807
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:30,700
契科夫先生
Mr. Chekov?

808
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,230
匹配 长官
It is a match, sir.

809
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,120
信号的出现也就表示
Its presence suggests

810
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,090
乌胡拉上尉和其他的船员
that Lieutenant Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew

811
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,070
都被扣留在克劳的老巢内
are being held at Krall's base of operation.

812
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,630
能把他们传送出来吗
Can you beam them out?

813
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,870
不能 舰长 那里有某种地质上的干扰
No, sir. There is some geological interference

814
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,260
会阻挡传送器的信号
that is blocking the transporter signal.

815
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,770
那我们只能闯进去
Well, I guess we're gonna have to go in

816
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,370
用老办法把他们解救出来了
and break them out the old-fashioned way.

817
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,910
你们不能去这个地方
You cannot go to this place.

818
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,870
每一个去那里的人 他都杀
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

819
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,790
那 那你去过那里 你见过
You've... You've been there? You've seen it?

820
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,970
干嘛不说了 小姑娘
Well, why didn't you say something, lassie?

821
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,560
因为我知道你会要我带你去那里
Because I know you will ask me to take you there.

822
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,460
如果你的朋友在那里 他们会死
If your friends are there, then they will die,

823
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,390
像我家人一样
just like my family.

824
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,310
我绝对不回死亡的地方去
And I will not go back to that death place!

825
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,720
是 你是逃出来的
Aye, but if you've escaped,

826
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,570
那就能告诉我们进出的路
then you can show us the way in and the way out.

827
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,470
不 这不是我们的约定 蒙哥马利·斯科蒂
No! This is not the deal we made, Montgomery Scotty.

828
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,030
如果选择做这件事 那就靠自己
If you choose to do this, you are on your own.

829
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,040
噢 等等 等一下
Wait.

830
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,180
让她走吧
Let her go.

831
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,430
她也失去了她的族人 舰长
She's lost people, too, Captain.

832
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,590
在那儿的都是我们的朋友 对吗 小姑娘
Look, that's our friends out there, lassie. Right?

833
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,430
不能丢下他们不管
We cannae just leave them behind.

834
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,870
现在 我们真的需要你的帮助
Now, we could really use your help.

835
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,950
我们只希望你能勇敢一点儿
We just need you to be brave, is all.

836
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,620
我们还在那里的时候
When we were in that place,

837
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,950
克劳会来带走一个人
Krall would come and take someone.

838
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,270
那些叫声
There were screams.

839
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,430
到现在我还能听见
I can still hear them.

840
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,670
我们就再也看不到那个人了
And we would not see that person again.

841
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,060
我们也不知道谁是下一个
We did not know who would be next.

842
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,790
我父亲计划了一次逃跑
My father planned an escape.

843
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,990
但是被其中一个叫 玛纳斯的看到了
But we were seen by the one they call Manas.

844
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,150
我父亲跟他打了起来 所以我才能逃出来
My father fought him so I could get out.

845
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,270
他很勇敢 可玛纳斯杀了他
He was brave and Manas killed him.

846
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,790
你们想的事做不到
What you want is impossible.

847
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:33,210
也许不行 对吧
Look, maybe it's not.Right.

848
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,110
我祖母常说
My wee granny used to say,

849
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,980
一捆筷子你掰不断的
"Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."

850
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,830
大事面前你是一分子 对吧
You're part of something bigger now, lassie.

851
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,870
可不能放弃
Right? Dinnae give up on that.

852
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,910
因为我们就绝对不会放弃你
'Cause we'll sure as hell never give up on you.

853
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,950
大家庭里一分子的意义就在这里
That is what being part of a crew is all about.

854
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,150
这就是你相信的吗 詹姆斯·T
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

855
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,990
我只知道 有你机会会更大
All I know is we stand a better chance with you.

856
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,830
挖掘的机器可以挖一个隧道 是通往坑地的
The digging machines uncovered a tunnel that goes into the crater.

857
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,060
我就是这么出来的
That's how I got out.

858
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,830
那我们就这么进去
So that'll be our way in.

859
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,010
外勤小队会被传送到隧道的另一边
An away team will beam to the other side of the tunnel,

860
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,180
往下走到克劳的老巢
follow it to Krall's base,

861
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,190
进入到建筑内部救人出来
get inside the building and break out the crew.

862
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,590
舰长 我们没有办法锁定坑地的任何人
Uh, Captain, we cannot lock onto anyone inside the crater

863
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,820
再把他传送出来
in order to beam them out.

864
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,070
可以装个脉冲信标 充当模式增强器
Oh, I could rig up pulse beacons as pattern enhancers.

865
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,800
- 让信号从坑地里传出来 - 是
That'd get the signal out of the crater. - All right.

866
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,760
富兰克林号一次能传送多少人
How many people can the Franklin transport at a time?

867
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,030
再做一点儿调校 20个最多
Uh, with a wee bit of modification, 20 max,

868
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,950
但我不清楚它能坚持多久
but I'm not sure how long it would hold out.

869
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,260
老骨头 契科夫 婕拉
Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,

870
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,490
跟我组成外勤小队
you're with me on the away team.

871
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,350
斯科特把传送器调校好
Mr. Scott, modify that transporter

872
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,610
- 然后尽一切可能让这艘星舰运转起来 - 是
- and then do everything you can to get this ship operational.- Aye.

873
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,350
舰长 契科夫对技术的敏锐
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

874
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,190
使得他与斯科特留在这星舰上更有价值
makes him more valuable aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

875
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,120
也因此由我替代他符合逻辑
It is thereby logical that I would replace him.

876
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,860
怎么就符合逻辑了 斯波克
Why is that logical, Spock?

877
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,200
你才刚好一点儿
You just got back on your feet.

878
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,910
乌胡拉上尉在那个设施里 吉姆
Lieutenant Uhura is in that facility, Jim.

879
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,750
我会把他看紧的
I'll keep an eye on him.

880
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,750
明白了
Understood.

881
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,830
可克劳的士兵到处都是
But his soldiers are everywhere.

882
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,350
进去会被看见
We won't pass unseen.

883
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,030
我们需要分散注意力的办法
What we require is a diversion.

884
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,710
我想我有个办法
I think I have an idea.

885
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,230
这就是艾布纳塞
This is Abronath.

886
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,910
它被古人们当做武器使用
It was used by the Ancient Ones as a weapon.

887
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,470
但不能控制它致命的威力
But when they could not control its deadly power,

888
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,790
于是 把它分成两半
they split it into two

889
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,270
投向了无尽的太空
and ejected the halves into space,

890
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,990
希望它永远消失
hoping it would be lost forever.

891
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,390
不过我很欣慰
But I am grateful.

892
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,150
我竭尽毕生 始终在寻找
I have spent lifetimes searching for it,

893
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,150
没料到你们替我
only to have you

894
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,630
找到了 另一半
find it for me.

895
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,070
一首命运的诗文
The poetry of fate.

896
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,470
我出生的那个世界
The world that I was born into

897
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,070
跟你们的截然不同
is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

898
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,830
我们经受过痛苦 体验过恐怖
We knew pain. We knew terror.

899
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:24,030
抗争让我们强大
Struggle made us strong.

900
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:27,070
没有和平 没有团结一致
Not peace. Not unity.

901
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,070
这些不过是联邦想让你们相信的谬论
These are myths the Federation would have you believe.

902
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:36,820
你说的那些言辞
Those are strong words.

903
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,020
也许你也相信这番话
You might even believe them,

904
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,350
可在你身上一定还有别的
but there's something else going on with you.

905
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,950
在你身体里面
Something underneath.

906
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
乌胡拉
Uhura!

907
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,990
等等
Wait.

908
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,020
你想把它怎么样
What are you doing with her?

909
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,520
你已经得到了你想要的东西 放她走
You already got what you wanted! Let her go!

910
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,550
希尔
Syl!

911
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,110
不要
No, please!

912
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,470
放她出来
Let her go!

913
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,710
玛纳斯 是时候了
Manas, it's time.

914
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,430
星际联邦将前沿疆域的推进
The Federation has pushed the frontier

915
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,270
持续了几个世纪
for centuries.

916
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,430
以后不会了
But no longer.

917
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,140
就从这里开始 上尉
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

918
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,830
前沿疆域就从这里开始反击
This is where the frontier pushes back.

919
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,870
这边
This way.

920
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,390
她哪儿去了
Where is she?

921
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,190
我得承认这绝对分散注意力
I've got to admit, that's a hell of a distraction.

922
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,520
你们的朋友在那里
Your friends are over there.

923
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,230
走吧
Come on.

924
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,990
我去对付他们。

925
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,070
你带领我们走了很远。

926
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,400
完成我们的使命，克劳。

927
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,270
去吧
Go!

928
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,780
中校 乌胡拉被抓走了
Commander. Uhura, they took her.

929
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,320
带余下的船员去安全的地方
Get the remainder of the crew to safety.

930
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,830
快 我们走 快走
Come on, let's go! Move!

931
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,270
- 大家围成一圈 - 做好准备
- Stay in the circle. - Come on! Hurry!

932
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,690
我收到他们了 斯科特先生
I've got them, Mr. Scott!

933
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,310
好的 契科夫先生 增强信号强度
Okay, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal.

934
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,910
我们一次要传回20个人
We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.

935
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,790
- 是 - 希望这次别搞砸了
- Aye. - Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

936
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,390
传送
Energize!

937
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,990
斯波克
Spock.

938
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,950
你来这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

939
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,390
很明显 我是来救你的
Clearly, I am here to rescue you.

940
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,860
我们走
Let's go.

941
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,790
很高兴见到你 小不点儿
Good to see you, wee man.

942
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,910
你会死在这里…

943
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,290
就像你父亲一样。

944
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,010
传送器要10秒钟之后才能完成充能 医生
Ten seconds until the transporter's recharged, Doctor.

945
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,990
- 等我信号 - 医生
- Wait for my signal. - Doctor!

946
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,070
该死的 我们不能扔下他们
Damn it, man, we're not leaving without them!

947
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,350
快点儿 我们走
Come on. Let's go. Move!

948
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,950
快点儿 快走 快
Let's go! Come on!

949
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,490
准备好来接你们了 舰长 把你们的信标打开
We're ready for you next, Captain. Just turn on your beacon.

950
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,910
斯科蒂 人全接到了吗
Scotty, do you have everybody?

951
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,610
是的 长官 只剩你和婕拉
Aye, sir. Everyone except you and Jaylah.

952
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,000
打开信标 把你们传回来
Hit the beacon and we'll grab you.

953
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,300
你要被他们抛弃了。

954
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,120
舰长 打开信标
Captain, your beacon!

955
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,180
- 是信号 - 传送
- There it is! - Energize.

956
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,510
婕拉 快
Jaylah, now!

957
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,160
好了 好了
Okay...

958
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,390
下次可别这么玩了
Let's never do that again.

959
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,230
我同意 詹姆斯·T
I agree, James T.

960
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,440
你还好吗
You all right?

961
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,950
舰长 他手里的那东西 它
Captain! This thing he has...

962
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,630
约克城 他想摧毁约克城基地
Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

963
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,990
你用我的房子
You take my house

964
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,950
你要让它飞起来
and you make it fly.

965
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,710
斯科蒂 能让它发动起来吗
Scotty, can you get this thing started?

966
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,890
什么 发动可以 飞起来就另当别论了
Started, yes. Flying, sir, that's a different thing.

967
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,530
这种旧飞船直接在太空建造
These old vessels, they were built in space.

968
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,940
就没打算从大气层里起飞
They were never supposed to take off from atmosphere.

969
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,150
想办法让它飞
Make it happen.

970
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,130
叫它星际飞船是有道理的
They're called starships for a reason, Captain.

971
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,710
你现在跟我说这个
You're telling me this now?

972
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,170
因为我不想让你失望 对吧
Because I didn't want to disappoint you, you know,

973
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,150
万一你回不来呢
in case you didn't make it back.

974
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,510
你想得真周到 斯科特先生
How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.

975
01:21:58,510 --> 01:21:59,470
舰长
Captain.

976
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,620
那家伙起飞了
He's launching.

977
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,430
攻击约克城基地可能只是个开始
The attack on Yorktown may be just the beginning.

978
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,000
装备这样的生物武器
Armed with this bio-weapon,

979
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,430
可以让他毁灭一切生命
he could rid it of all life

980
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,290
再利用基地的先进科技
and use the base's advanced technology

981
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,240
继而攻击隶属星际联邦的众多行星
to attack an untold number of Federation planets.

982
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,410
那我们就必须让这东西飞起来
Then we're just gonna have to get this thing flying.

983
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,150
不能跳线启动 长官
We cannae just jumpstart it, sir!

984
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,200
星际联邦 富兰克林号
星舰代码 NX-326

985
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,870
好嘞 所有系统上线
Okay! All systems online.

986
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,550
二锂室运行水平70% 还在上升
Dilithium chambers at 70% and climbing.

987
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,390
主动力引擎 准备就绪
Primary support engines standing by.

988
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,030
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu.

989
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,790
你能 就是 让它飞上天吧 嗯
You can, you know, fly this thing, right?

990
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,420
您开玩笑吧 长官
You kidding me, sir?

991
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,260
好极了
Fantastic.

992
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,710
斯科蒂 你那儿怎么样
Scotty, how we looking?

993
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,350
她永远都随时待命 长官
Ready as she'll ever be, sir.

994
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,960
我就爱听你这话 好了
That's what I like to hear. All right.

995
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,790
老骨头 船员们情况如何
Bones, where are we with the crew?

996
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,530
我还需要一个设施齐全的医疗舱
I could use a functioning med-bay,

997
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,070
其他的 我们在这儿很安全
but otherwise we're secure down here.

998
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,230
苏鲁先生
Mr. Sulu,

999
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,990
我们必须达到终端速度
we have to achieve terminal velocity

1000
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,510
稳定器才能够提供足够的升力
in order for the stabilizers to provide lift.

1001
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,470
您能肯定现在的 这个掉落高度够高吗
Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that?

1002
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,230
会弄明白的
We'll find out.

1003
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,750
开始吧 苏鲁先生
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

1004
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,460
遵命 长官
Aye-aye, Captain.

1005
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,290
契科夫先生 听我指令
Mr. Chekov,

1006
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,790
准备完全打开前置稳定器
be ready to hit the forward stabilizers full on my mark.

1007
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,100
- 四分之一脉冲速度 - 是
- One quarter impulse. - Aye.

1008
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,270
二分之一脉冲速度 契科夫先生
One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.

1009
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,630
是
Aye.

1010
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,750
应该系安全带 快去 快快快 快去
We should belt up. Go on. Go!

1011
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,660
慢着点儿 苏鲁先生 别把她摔成两半
Easy, Mr. Sulu. Let's not break her in half.

1012
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:50,900
撞击距离

终端速度

1013
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,670
随时点火 苏鲁先生
Any time, Mr. Sulu.

1014
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,800
撞击距离

终端速度

1015
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,590
就现在 契科夫先生
Now, Mr. Chekov!

1016
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,910
敌我识别警告 有飞船接近
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

1017
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,030
所有频率均未收到身份识别请求
No reply to all-frequency I.D. request.

1018
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,150
显示
Visual.

1019
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,400
多个不明身份飞船来袭

1020
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,070
红色警戒 红色警戒
Red alert! Red alert!

1021
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,870
看他们能有多先进
Look how far they've come.

1022
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,160
所有人员
Please proceed

1023
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,030
请立即前往指定的安全区
to designated safety zones immediately.

1024
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,560
所有人员请立即前往指定的安全区
Please proceed to designated safety zones immediately.

1025
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,650
我在所有来自约克城的频段上
I'm picking up distress signals

1026
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,110
都监测到了求救信号
from every frequency coming from Yorktown.

1027
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,390
克劳已经发动了攻击
Krall's already started his attack.

1028
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,390
斯科特先生 我们手里有什么武器
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons do we have?

1029
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,470
我们有脉冲相位炮 还有空间鱼雷
Uh, we have pulsed phase cannons and spatial torpedoes.

1030
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,560
很好 弹药上膛
Great. Lock and load.

1031
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,230
这没有用处 你没有办法打败蜜蜂
It does not matter. You cannot defeat the bees.

1032
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,550
好 也许 也许能把它们引开
Maybe, uh, maybe we lure them away.

1033
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,990
我们怎么 怎么才能给约克城基地争取时间疏散呢
How do we get Yorktown time to get people to safety?

1034
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,170
不行 跟那些东西比 我们就像马和马车
No, we are a horse and buggy compared to those things.

1035
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,080
我们自己都快散架了 舰长
We're barely holding together as it is, Captain.

1036
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,090
舰长
Captain,

1037
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:32,070
蜜蜂的飞行模式由指定的个体决定
the flight patterns of bees are determined by individual decisions.

1038
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,540
克劳的蜂群编队过于复杂
Krall's swarm formations are too complex not to rely

1039
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,220
因此无法依赖某些形式的 统一神经网络感应协调
on some form of unified cyberpathic coordination.

1040
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,880
- 根据我的推断 如果 - 斯波克
- I surmise that if we... - Spock!

1041
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:39,590
直接说结论
Skip to the end.

1042
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,970
他要说的是 如果我们能迷惑蜂群
What he's saying is that if we disorient the swarm

1043
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,670
就能把他打垮
we can kick its ass!

1044
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,510
很精确
Precisely.

1045
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,650
斯科蒂 能把我传送到敌人的飞船上吗
Scotty, can you beam me onto one of those swarm ships?

1046
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,840
你是不是已经彻底疯了
Have you gone completely mad?

1047
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
- 能还是不能 - 不能
- Yes or no? - No!

1048
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,390
能吧
Yes!

1049
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,680
也许吧
Maybe.

1050
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,550
舰长 我对那些飞船内部的熟悉程度
Captain, my familiarity of the interior of those ships,

1051
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,040
简而言之 让我更具备外勤任务的资格
however brief, makes me more qualified for this away mission.

1052
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,030
斯波克 你的伤还没好
Spock, you're still hurt.

1053
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,030
她说得对 斯波克
She's right, Spock.

1054
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,070
我对关切表示感谢
I acknowledge and respect your concerns.

1055
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,200
或许你会感到更有信心 如果某位
Perhaps you would feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone

1056
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,430
对飞船和我的伤情都很熟悉的人陪伴前往
with familiarity of both the ship and my injury.

1057
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,110
他一定会喜欢的
He's gonna love this.

1058
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:18,910
你想叫我干什么
You want me to do what?

1059
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,830
请跟我来 医生
Come along, Doctor.

1060
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:22,830
喔 等一下
Whoa! Wait a minute.

1061
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,590
你这绿血怪 忘恩负义的
Why, you green-blooded ingrate.

1062
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:25,870
是你的馊点子
This was your idea!

1063
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,480
是个好点子 老骨头
It's a good idea, Bones.

1064
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,520
你听好了 下回再有什么管子卡在你的腹部
You know, next time you have a piece of pipe

1065
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,860
叫管道工帮你拔
stuck in your transverse, call a plumber.

1066
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,850
务必想办法破坏那些飞船
Just make sure you find a way to break those things.

1067
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,680
要是太危险 就马上传你们回来
If it gets hairy, I'll beam you straight back.

1068
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,920
- 传送 - 等等 等
- Energize. - Wait...

1069
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,360
圆满完成任务
You're gonna do great!

1070
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,830
该死的 吉姆 我是医生 又不是
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a...

1071
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,060
你应该还记得上一次我开这玩意儿的时候
You do realize the last time I flew one of these things

1072
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:52,710
是坠机了
we crashed.

1073
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,070
所以你别怨我 要是
So don't blame me if we...

1074
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,800
撞上了东西
Hit something.

1075
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,480
斯波克呼叫富兰克林号
Spock to Franklin.

1076
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,980
斯波克 我们听到了
Spock, we read you.

1077
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,410
舰长 从探查情况来看
Captain, from what I can ascertain,

1078
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,190
它们的确通过共享一个神经网络链接
the ships do indeed share a cyberpathic link

1079
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,600
来协调行动
which coordinates their actions.

1080
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,860
正在向你们转接
Patching it through now.

1081
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,750
原来就是那个信号
That's what that signal was.

1082
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,220
它们不是在干扰我们 而是在相互说话
They weren't jamming us, they were talking to each other.

1083
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,510
怎么才能让它们说不了话呢
Well, how do we get them to stop talking?

1084
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,350
那弄个电磁聚焦怎么样
What about electromagnetic focusing?

1085
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,130
我们可以用传送器扰乱它们的网络
We could use the transporters, disrupt their network.

1086
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,830
有焦点或许过于明确
The focus might be too specific.

1087
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,470
如果我们可以把某种扰乱通讯的信号
If we could plant some sort of disruptive communication signal

1088
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:27,090
植入蜂群内部
inside the swarm,

1089
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,250
或许会对它们的协同能力产生不利影响
it might adversely affect their capacity to coordinate.

1090
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,840
一定要设在一个它们想象不到的频率上
It would have to be at a frequency they will not anticipate.

1091
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,090
然后我们再引发连锁反应
We could cause a chain reaction

1092
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,560
就能击垮整个蜂群
that would wipe out the whole swarm.

1093
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,910
长官 像那样的封闭式网络
Sir, a closed network like that

1094
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,590
可能会受到甚高频的影响
might be susceptible to very high frequency.

1095
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,270
甚高频
VHF.

1096
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,470
无线电
Radio.

1097
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:42,930
我们 我们可以从飞船上广播什么东西
We can broadcast something from the ship

1098
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:44,070
扰乱它们的网络
to drown out their link.

1099
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,750
又吵又会分心的
Something loud and distracting.

1100
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,430
又吵又会分心的
Loud and distracting?

1101
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,910
我这儿正好就有
I've got just the thing!

1102
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,950
不要弄坏我的音乐
Do not break my music.

1103
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,800
弄坏 这是要给你升级
Break it? You're getting an upgrade.

1104
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,590
再过60秒蜂群飞船就要攻入基地了
Swarm ships are 60 seconds from breaking through!

1105
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,390
我只要重新配置甚高频输出
I've just got to reconfigure the VHF output

1106
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,030
给它接上一个多相扫描器
into a multiphasic sweep.

1107
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,260
让我来接
Let me do it.

1108
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,760
让她接
Let her do it.

1109
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:19,430
还是该让你接
You do it.

1110
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,390
这样 看 很简单
There, see? Simple.

1111
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,670
好了 舰长 我们准备好广播了
All right. Captain, we're ready to broadcast.

1112
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,830
但信号没法传递太远 我们得近点儿
But the signal won't travel far. We have to get closer.

1113
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,750
- 要多近 - 很近
- How close? - Very.

1114
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,150
拦截航线 苏鲁先生
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

1115
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,690
让我们直接飞到它们中间去
Put us right in the middle of that thing.

1116
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,860
是 先生
Yes, sir.

1117
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,030
我的老朋友
My old friend.

1118
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,000
<i><b>约克城星舰基地</b></i>

1119
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,630
蜂群转向回来了
The swarm ships are doubling back!

1120
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,430
它们正在集结成一波攻势 舰长
They are forming an attack wave, sir.

1121
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:05,950
已经吸引到它们的注意了
I think we got their attention.

1122
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,940
把稳舵 苏鲁先生
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.

1123
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:08,040
所有人都打起精神来
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1124
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,870
斯波克 准备待命退出蜂群
Spock, stand by to drop out of formation.

1125
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,210
斯科蒂 都准备妥当了吗
Scotty, you all cued up back there?

1126
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:12,110
是 长官
Aye, sir!

1127
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,660
准备进行广播 频率57.7兆赫
Ready to broadcast at 577 megahertz.

1128
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:15,790
选好哪首了 小姑娘
Made your choice, lassie?

1129
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,590
我要带鼓点儿和喊叫的
I have the beat and shouting.

1130
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,350
我们来点儿噪音
Let's make some noise.

1131
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,150
这个选得不错啊
That's a good choice.

1132
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:07,010
再快点儿 医生
Faster, Doctor.

1133
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:08,830
它们的轨迹衰变 我们会有爆燃的风险
We risk being consumed by their trajectorial decay.

1134
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,280
指手画脚的后座司机
Damn backseat driver.

1135
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,190
闪避 医生
Evade, Doctor!

1136
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:13,270
没错 我看见 看见了
I see it, I see it!

1137
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,790
这算是古典音乐
Is that classical music?

1138
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,790
是的 医生 似乎是这样
Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be.

1139
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:39,420
乌胡拉上尉
Lieutenant Uhura,

1140
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,590
让约克城基地也用相同频率进行广播
make sure Yorktown has the frequency to broadcast.

1141
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,910
长官 我们收到了干扰频率
Sir, we now have the disruption frequency.

1142
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:48,150
广播
Broadcast.

1143
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,600
你们俩没事吧 斯波克
You two all right, Spock?

1144
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,580
我们没事 舰长
We are fine, Captain,

1145
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,040
但仍有三艘飞船飞向约克城基地
but there are still three ships heading into Yorktown.

1146
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:15,960
一定是克劳 跟着他 斯波克
That's got to be Krall. Keep on him, Spock.

1147
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:19,150
要不惜一切代价 绝不能让他用那种武器
Do whatever it takes to stop him from using that weapon.

1148
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,950
我的房子要坏了
My house is breaking!

1149
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,820
我们失去了舰体装甲极性
We've lost the polarization of the hull plating!

1150
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,070
我得把二锂室的动力重新布线
I can reroute the power from the dilithium chambers.

1151
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,190
我需要你
I need you.

1152
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,660
还有你 婕拉 我们走
And I need you, Jaylah. Let's go!

1153
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,990
不能跟丢 医生
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1154
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,320
我很欢迎你来跟我换个位置 斯波克
You're more than welcome to switch places with me, Spock.

1155
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,670
舰长 拦截三艘飞船是不可能的
Captain, intercepting all three ships is an impossibility.

1156
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,310
给我约克城基地的结构图
Get me a schematic of Yorktown!

1157
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,350
那儿 约克城基地总部
There! Yorktown headquarters!

1158
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,190
契科夫先生 能对中央广场做一次生物扫描吗
Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan of Central Plaza?

1159
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:55,310
是
Aye.

1160
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,030
他们正在疏散平民
They are clearing civilians.

1161
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:58,990
老骨头 前面有个城市广场
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1162
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,190
你必须把克劳的飞船赶到那里
You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.

1163
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,310
- 为什么 - 你就照做
- Why? - Just do it!

1164
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,030
苏鲁 让我们拉起来
Sulu, get us up there.

1165
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,630
大家抓紧了
Hold onto something!

1166
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,550
干得漂亮 老骨头
Great work, Bones.

1167
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,350
谢了 吉姆
Thanks, Jim.

1168
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,550
眼下我得弄明白怎么降落
Now I've just got to figure out how to land.

1169
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:30,430
舰长 撞击导致了三处舰体破裂
Captain, I have three hull breaches from the impact.

1170
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,030
第三层甲板 货舱 还有轮机室
Deck 3, the cargo bay, and the engine room.

1171
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,110
- 好了 苏鲁 契科夫 - 是
- All right, Sulu, Chekov. - Aye.

1172
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:36,590
去检查一下货舱和第三层甲板
check the cargo bay and Deck 3.

1173
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,810
必须证实那个武器已经被销毁
We need confirmation that the weapon has been neutralized

1174
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,900
克劳也已经死亡
and Krall is dead!

1175
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,800
舰长
Captain!

1176
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,760
是克劳
It's Krall.

1177
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,510
我们见他干过
We've seen him do this.

1178
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:12,030
这应该是某种能量转移 能改变他的身体
It's some kind of energy transference. It physically changes him.

1179
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,870
他一定还在星舰上 否则应该看到他离开
He must still be onboard. We would have seen him leave.

1180
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,140
苏鲁 联络约克城基地的安全部门
Sulu, contact Yorktown security

1181
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,390
封锁这艘飞船
and lock down the ship.

1182
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,820
我们走
Let's go.

1183
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,310
向前沿疆域推进
Push the frontier.

1184
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,260
时间差不多了
It's about damn time.

1185
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:49,020
- 好了吗 长官 - 是的
- Are you ready? - Yeah.

1186
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,110
好了 宝贝儿 我们走
All right, baby, let's go.

1187
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,030
- 时间差不多了 - 向前沿疆域推进
- It's about damn time. - Push the frontier.

1188
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,790
舰长
Captain!

1189
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,680
- 时间差不多了 - 向前沿疆域推进
- It's about damn time. - Push the frontier.

1190
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,840
- 时间差不多了 - 向前沿疆域推进
- It's about damn time. - Push the frontier.

1191
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,230
- 时间差不多了 - 向前沿疆域推进
- It's about damn time. - Push the frontier.

1192
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,950
- 时间差不多了 - 向前沿疆域推进
- It's about damn time. - Push the frontier.

1193
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,990
向前沿疆域推进
...frontier.

1194
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,990
向前沿疆域推进
...frontier.

1195
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,110
就是他
It's him.

1196
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,470
斯科蒂 我要你链接富兰克林号的数据库
Scotty, I need you to link into the Franklin database.

1197
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,860
想办法弄清楚巴尔萨泽·爱迪生的情况
Find out what you can about Balthazar Edison.

1198
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,760
- 什么 富兰克林号舰长 - 没错
- The captai n of the Franklin? - Yeah.

1199
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,480
- 长官 他已经死很久了 - 不 他没有
- Sir, he'll be long dead. - No. He's not.

1200
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,670
不清楚是怎么回事 但爱迪生就是克劳
I don't know how, but Edison is Krall.

1201
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,880
你有什么发现
What'd you find?

1202
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,180
呃 那个 他的记录
His record goes back

1203
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,880
可以追溯到星际联邦成立之前
way before the Federation even existed.

1204
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:52,520
巴尔萨泽·爱迪生
.
.

1205
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,300
巴尔萨泽·爱迪生
他是地球武装突击小队的一名少校
He was a major in the United Earth Military Assault

1206
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:54,490

他是地球武装突击小队的一名少校
He was a major in the United Earth Military Assault

1207
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,670
执行过大量地球以外的任务
Command Operation. A lot of off-world combat.

1208
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,760
他是个军人
He was a soldier.

1209
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,010
是 而且非常优秀
Aye, sir. And a pretty good one.

1210
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,500
但是小队遣散后他的生涯就结束了
His military service came to an end when MACO was disbanded.

1211
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,950
为什么了 怎么了
Why, what happened?

1212
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:03,790
是联邦 长官
The Federation, sir.

1213
01:39:03,790 --> 01:39:05,440
星际舰队不是军事机构
Starfleet. We're not a military agency.

1214
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,450
他们让他当了舰长 给了他富兰克林号
They made him a captain and gave him the Franklin.

1215
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,670
- 把他的日志调出来 - 是 长官
- Scotty, bring up his logs. - Aye, sir.

1216
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,340
舰长日志
Captain's Log...

1217
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:13,110
最后一条
Last entry.

1218
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,190
舰长日志 已经记不起星历是哪一天了
Captain's Log... I don't remember the stardate.

1219
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,030
所有的求救呼叫都没有回应
All distress calls unanswered.

1220
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,750
至于船员
Of the crew,

1221
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,950
也只剩下了三个
only three remain.

1222
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,470
我绝不允许
I won't allow it!

1223
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,030
这里的原生物种很早以前就遗弃了这颗行星
The indigenous race abandoned this planet long ago.

1224
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,550
他们留下了非常精密复杂的采矿设备
They left behind sophisticated mining equipment

1225
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,550
和能充当劳力的无人机
and a drone workforce.

1226
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,230
他们有某种技术
They have some sort of technology

1227
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,310
能够延长人的 寿命
that prolongs life.

1228
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,110
不管要我和我的船员付出什么代价 我都愿意
I will do whatever it takes for me and my crew.

1229
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,750
星际联邦根本不在乎我们
The Federation do not care about us.

1230
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:01,430
你们可能再也见不到我了
You'll probably never see me again.

1231
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,910
万一见到了
But if you do,

1232
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,910
做好准备
be ready.

1233
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,190
为什么他还没有用他的武器
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1234
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,040
因为他要找能造成最大破坏力的地方
'Cause he wants to find somewhere to inflict maximum damage.

1235
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:13,750
他需要一个能流通的系统
He needs a distribution system.

1236
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,810
是这里的空气循环系统
They have to circulate air here, right?

1237
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:19,350
是的 长官 基地核心有一个大气空气调节器
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric regulator at the core.

1238
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,760
上尉 联络基地
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown.

1239
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,120
- 在找到克劳之前 务必关闭调节器 - 明白
- Make sure they shut it down until we find Krall. - Yes.

1240
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,600
怎么样才能进入核心区域
How would he access the core?

1241
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,460
呃 这个
Uh, well,

1242
01:40:25,460 --> 01:40:28,370
在空间站的重力结合点有一座维修塔
there's a maintenance tower at the station's gravitational nexus.

1243
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:29,200
只有一条路
That's the only way.

1244
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,910
斯科蒂 你去基地控制室 一定要保证关闭它
Scotty, you get over there. Make sure it gets shut down!

1245
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,110
小姑娘 跟我走
Lassie, you're with me.

1246
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,750
这个东西 你没有办法把它关掉
Look, this thing is impossible to shut down.

1247
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,110
是吗 好吧
Aye, well,

1248
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,310
那我试试看
we'll see about that.

1249
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,790
斯科蒂先生 调节器怎么还没关掉
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

1250
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,160
我们正在努力 长官
We're working on it, sir,

1251
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,410
但你该明白我要突破很多安全协议
but as you can imagine there's a lot of safety protocols

1252
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,920
毕竟这玩意儿关系到
surrounding the thing that, you know,

1253
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,910
- 所有人的性命 - 想想办法
- keeps everybody alive. - Figure something out.

1254
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,120
小心点儿 舰长
Be careful, Captain.

1255
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:12,830
你越靠近核心
Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy

1256
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,510
重力的作用就越混乱
the closer you get to the center.

1257
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,490
也许 我们该扫描一下结构图
Maybe we should scan the operational schematics,

1258
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,290
- 看有没有后门 - 好的
- see if there's a back door. - Right.

1259
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,640
小姑娘 我需要你帮忙
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1260
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,140
住手
Stop!

1261
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,950
你在那个星球经历了什么事情
What happened to you out there, Edison?

1262
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,220
爱迪生
Edison.

1263
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:48,860
我不得不说 柯克
I have to say, Kirk,

1264
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,830
我怀念过去的自己
I've missed being me.

1265
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,950
我们失去了自我
We lost ourselves

1266
01:41:55,950 --> 01:41:58,190
但找到了目标
but gained a purpose!

1267
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:03,400
我们要让银河系重新陷入争斗
A means to bring the galaxy back to the struggle

1268
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,300
让人类变得强大
that made humanity strong.

1269
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,710
我觉得你低估了人类
I think you underestimate humanity.

1270
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,070
我曾经为人类而战
I fought for humanity!

1271
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,870
同新地人和罗慕伦人的战争中 我们牺牲数以百万
Lost millions to the Xindi and Romulan Wars.

1272
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:16,500
这一切为了什么
And for what?

1273
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,190
为了一个星际联邦的舰长职位
For the Federation to sit me in a captain's chair

1274
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,390
为了跟敌人握手言和
and break bread with the enemy.

1275
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,870
时代变了 我们必须与时俱进
We change. We have to.

1276
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,390
否则我们就会陷入永无休止的战争
Or we spend the rest of our lives fighting the same battles.

1277
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,830
你已经输了
You lost!

1278
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,950
你不可能过得去的
There's no way you can make it back there.

1279
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,110
放弃吧
Give up.

1280
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,790
像你一样吗
What, like you did?

1281
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,110
我看过你的舰长日志
I read your ship's log,

1282
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,430
詹姆斯·T·柯克舰长
Captain James T. Kirk.

1283
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,230
至少我知道我是谁
At least I know what I am.

1284
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,470
我是一个军人
I am a soldier.

1285
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,830
你打赢了战争 爱迪生
You won the war, Edison.

1286
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,750
你为我们创造了和平
You gave us peace.

1287
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,270
和平
Peace

1288
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,430
我出生的时代没有和平
is not what I was born into.

1289
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,160
斯科蒂
Scotty.

1290
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:48,070
舰长 他正在试图利用重力涡流返回核心
Captain, he's using the gravitational slipstream to carry him back to the center.

1291
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,710
不 不
No! No!

1292
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:41,800

- 那是什么 - 是那武器
- What's that? - The weapon's in the chamber.

1293
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,800
检测到外来元素
- 那是什么 - 是那武器
- What's that? - The weapon's in the chamber.

1294
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,500
检测到外来元素
舰长 我们必须马上阻止他
Captain, we have to stop the processor now

1295
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,270
不然约克城里所有要喘气的生物都完了
or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead!

1296
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,660
你休想阻止
You can't stop it.

1297
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,710
你死定了
You will die.

1298
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,870
为拯救他人牺牲自己
Better to die saving lives

1299
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:07,550
好过牺牲他人拯救自己
than to live with taking them.

1300
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,590
这就是我出生的时代
That's what I was born into.

1301
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:12,240
斯科蒂
Scotty!

1302
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,010
长官 我想我能重新引导气流方向
Captain, I think we can redirect it.

1303
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,790
那里有一个排气舱口
There's a sealed construction hatch

1304
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,610
打开阀门就能把武器排放到太空
that will let you vent the weapon into space.

1305
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,050
我可以在这边远程解锁
Now, we can override the locks from up here,

1306
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,530
但还需要你进行手动操作
but you will have to activate the hatch.

1307
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:21,780
我只要按一下按钮吗
So I just hit a button.

1308
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,190
那不是按钮 长官
It's not a button, sir.

1309
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:25,390
是白色面板下面的银色拉杆
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

1310
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,190
- 看到了 - 一共四个
- Got it! - And there's four of them.

1311
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,000
一旦打开排气舱口
Once you've primed the hatch,

1312
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,800
你必须马上离开
you'll have to exit the chamber immediately.

1313
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,800
系统开始循环后 舱口就会打开
If the hatch is open when the processor cycles

1314
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,040
如果你还在里面 就会被吸入到太空
and you're in it, you're gonna get sucked into space.

1315
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,910
要是我打不开舱口呢
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

1316
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,560
你会被吸进大风扇里
You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.

1317
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,030
包括那武器 我们都会完蛋
With the weapon, and we all die.

1318
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,280
该死 吉姆 你恐怕来不及了
Damn it, Jim, you won't make it out in time!

1319
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,840
排气舱口
The vent!

1320
01:45:58,360 --> 01:46:00,110
快离开 詹姆斯·T
Get out of there, James T.!

1321
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,550
斯科蒂 最后一个舱口打不开
Scotty, the last hatch won't open!

1322
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,680
斯科蒂
Scotty!

1323
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,960
排气系统开启倒计时
快啊 舰长 没时间了
Work fast, Captain, time's running out!

1324
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,070
排气系统开启倒计时
恐怕他搞不定了
He's not gonna make it.

1325
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,800
不 不
No! No!

1326
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,070
进入手动操作模式
Manual override engaged.

1327
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,550
没有你我该怎么办 斯波克
What would I do without you, Spock?

1328
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,300
巴尔萨泽·爱迪生

1329
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:02,720
关闭档案
.
.

1330
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,070
关闭档案
多年来 星际联邦一直宣传他是个英雄
For decades the Federation taught that he was a hero.

1331
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,670
我想时间才能评判一切
I guess time will judge us all.

1332
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,070
他只是迷失了自我
He just got lost.

1333
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,110
你拯救了整个基地 柯克
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1334
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,510
拯救了数百万人 谢谢你
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1335
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,990
这不是我的功劳 从来不是
It wasn't just me. It never is.

1336
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,390
毋庸赘言 中将这个职位是你的了
Needless to say, the position of Vice Admiral is yours.

1337
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,590
没人比你更适合
No one deserves it more.

1338
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,430
中将不需要随舰出航吗
Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?

1339
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,070
是的 不需要
No. They don't.

1340
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,510
恕我冒犯 长官
Well, no offense, ma'am,

1341
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,430
那还有什么乐趣可言
but where's the fun in that?

1342
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,800
斯波克大使私人物品

1343
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,040
你没争取申请缩短任务时间吗
You didn't even try to get our time out here reduced?

1344
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,250
为什么要缩短任务时间
Why would I get it reduced?

1345
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,660
老骨头 我们现在知道穿过星云的航线了
Bones, we know our way through the nebula now.

1346
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,510
想想看 我们会发现什么
Can you imagine what we'll find!

1347
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,980
妄想消灭人类的外星暴君
Alien despots hell-bent on killing us?

1348
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,190
致命的外星病毒 微生物
Deadly space-borne viruses and bacteria?

1349
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:03,990
还有能瞬间消灭我们的宇宙异形
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies that could wipe us out in an instant!

1350
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:05,990
那该多有意思啊
It's gonna be so much fun.

1351
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,240
顺便问问 我们去哪儿
By the way, where are we going?

1352
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,760
不是去喝一杯吗
I thought we were gonna get a drink.

1353
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,190
我知道你说要保密 但是
I know you told me to keep it under wraps, but, uh...

1354
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,030
生日快乐
Happy Birthday!

1355
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,470
敏感先生
Mr. Sensitive?

1356
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,030
- 给你 拿好 - 谢了 斯科蒂
- There you go, laddie. - Thanks, Scotty.

1357
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,110
各位 举起酒杯
Everybody, raise a glass

1358
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:26,790
敬舰长詹姆斯·T·柯克
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1359
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,670
- 柯克舰长 - 谢谢大家
- Captain Kirk! - Thanks, everybody.

1360
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,470
- 敬进取号 - 敬进取号
- To the Enterprise. - To the Enterprise.

1361
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:34,950
还有
And

1362
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:37,270
逝去的朋友
to absent friends.

1363
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,670
- 敬逝去的朋友 - 干杯
- Here's to that. - Cheers.

1364
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,470
好了 派对开始了
All right, let's get this party started.

1365
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:44,620
轮到谁了
Whose round is it?

1366
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:48,390
给我来三杯 罗慕伦麦芽酒
Can I get three, uh, Romulan ales for me?

1367
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,550
我以为你要完成任务报告
I thought you had to finish your mission report.

1368
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:53,460
原本是的
I do.
