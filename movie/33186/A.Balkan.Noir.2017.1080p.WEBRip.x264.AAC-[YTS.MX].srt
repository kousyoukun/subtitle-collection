3
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,666
Friends... Seeing is believing.

4
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:33,000
And you can actually see for yourself
why Luckies taste better.

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, you see with your own eyes
that Luckies are made better...

6
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,250
...to taste better.

7
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,375
Watch closely now and listen carefully...

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,791
Did you bring the stuff?

9
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,291
Yeah, I'm fine too. Thanks for asking.

10
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,250
Right, sorry.

11
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,833
So how's it going?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,708
I never felt better, actually.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,791
Atarax, 25 mg. For anxiety.

14
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:45,250
Just basic stuff, nothing complicated.
Don't mix it with alcohol.

15
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,916
It'll make you feel relaxed and drowsy.

16
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,666
Inderal, 10 mg, for heart palpitations.

17
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:03,708
Makes the heart beat slower
and pump less blood through your body.

18
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,541
Common side effects may include
nightmares and sleep problems.

19
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,541
-So nothing you're not used to already.
-Thanks.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,583
Oxascand, 10 mg.

21
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,916
To treat severe anxiety.

22
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,666
When everything feels like shit
you take half a tablet.

23
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,541
Muscle relaxing and just sweet.

24
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,125
Reduce the usage gradually,
or the side effects get worse.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,166
Thanks. I appreciate it.

26
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,125
Thanks.

27
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,666
Wait a minute.

28
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,041
I can't do this anymore.
I can't keep helping you.

29
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,916
I'm drained.

30
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,291
It hurts me to see you like this.

31
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,541
OK, I guess you'll have to avoid me then.

32
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:47,666
Did you know that a man who loses
his wife is called "widower"...

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:51,583
...and a woman who loses
her husband is called "widow".

34
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,291
A child who loses her parents
is called "orphan"...

35
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,791
...but there are no words
for a parent who loses her child.

36
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:10,791
That loss is so devastating
we don't even have a word for it.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,916
MISSING

38
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,791
Turn off the engine.

39
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,666
Turn it off!

40
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,833
Turn off the engine and hand me the keys!

41
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,666
Is this what you came for?
To try to stop me?

42
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,416
Listen, I don't know what you're thinking,
but this won't end well.

43
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,583
Just look at yourself. You're losing it.

44
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,000
What the fuck are you doing?!

45
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:42,416
You've really lost it.
You've lost it completely!

46
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,916
He won't tell you anything,
no matter how much you beat him up

47
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,541
and then what do you do?

48
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,916
I don't care.
I know exactly what to do with him.

49
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,916
Let's go home...and just forget about this.

50
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
-Get out of the car. Go home.
-Let the police deal with it!

51
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
Call Nikola!

52
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,916
Get out. Go home.

53
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,000
Get out of the car!

54
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,250
Close it.

55
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,916
Close the door!

56
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,541
I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:05,666
-I don't think you should smoke here.
-Right, me neither.

58
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,250
But thanks for coming.
I know you didn't want to.

59
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,416
You're welcome.

60
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
Good idea, let some light in.

61
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,916
-Nice old theater, right?
-Yeah, really nice...

62
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,708
I'm happy you're here.

63
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,708
Well, at least someone's happy.

64
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,125
-She can't smoke in here.
-No, I'm aware of that.

65
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,291
Don't worry. Let us do our job
and you focus on doing yours.

66
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,291
There are people lining up outside
so maybe you should see to that.

67
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,250
God, I hate that cover.
And that fucking tree on it.

68
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,000
Hi.

69
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,791
OK, thank you all for coming.

70
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going back.

71
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,583
To Montenegro. Nikola called.

72
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,916
He has a really interesting lead.
He needs me down there.

73
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:27,250
We've done this so many times.
I can't do it anymore.

74
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:32,541
A whole chapter in this book
is devoted to false leads.

75
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,125
-Do you really want to do this again?
-Please, Oscar...

76
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,916
...just sign it.

77
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:44,166
The difference between me and you
is that I still didn't bury our child.

78
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,375
It's just that easy.

79
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,666
Right?

80
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,833
I don't know how you do it.

81
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,708
How do you sleep at night?

82
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,250
I do it because I have to.

83
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:09,166
I sleep because I need to get up
in the morning and go to work

84
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,833
because I need to live,
I need to laugh, cry, everything!

85
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,166
You sure have a lot of needs, don't you?

86
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,666
And how's that working out for you?

87
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,791
Does it have to be like this
every time we see each other?

88
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,375
Yes, apparently it does.

89
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,541
Listen...

90
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,375
...I don't know what to do anymore.

91
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,250
Come with me to Montenegro.

92
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,166
Nikola...

93
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,375
Nikola.

94
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,791
Nikola.

95
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,250
There's something I need to confess.

96
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,291
I've had a lot of time to think about this.

97
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,666
Sure, I could have accused you
of a lot of things...

98
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:41,125
...but I also had a lot of time to think
and to realize just who I am.

99
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,666
And why I'm here, on this earth.

100
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,583
I have experienced things that...

101
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,916
...wouldn't have been possible without you.

102
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,791
Have a look at this. Twelve centimeters.

103
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,000
Some idiot who felt threatened
by his new cellmate

104
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,833
and luckily sucked at making knives.

105
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,916
But I don't blame him. And I don't blame you.

106
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,000
The judge made a mistake, right?

107
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,916
The judge should have told it to me straight.

108
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,000
That he wasn't just
putting me away for six years...

109
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:27,416
...he was also taking
my wife and kids from me.

110
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,916
That he was taking my family.

111
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:36,666
That he would take everything I've earned
and everything I worked for. All I had.

112
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:41,375
But I don't blame him.

113
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,541
Do you know why?

114
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,375
Because I've had time to think.

115
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,541
I've had time to accept the Lord.

116
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,041
I know, that when the time comes
he will open up the gates for me.

117
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:10,666
The Lord knows when the time has come,
and the gates will be open for me.

118
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you understand?

119
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:23,000
And if the devil makes your anger explode...

120
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,291
...you just ask for refuge with God.

121
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,291
With God, Nikola.

122
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,041
Do you know what this means?

123
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,791
You know?

124
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:46,791
It means that my Lord
has given you a new chance, Nikola.

125
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:51,250
My Lord has given you a new chance.

126
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:56,666
He's giving you another chance, you dirty dog.

127
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,541
You ought to thank Him for that.

128
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:06,916
Look at you! Why so tense? Relax!

129
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,541
All that will change when you find Him.

130
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:17,583
I have found him, Nikola. I found peace.

131
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,375
You too will find peace,
when the moment comes.

132
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,916
But do you know what else
I would like to find?

133
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:31,125
I would like to find those fifty grand
that you and those cop buddies of yours took.

134
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,541
Protectors of peace and order.

135
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:38,291
And I would like to find them today.

136
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,666
But the Lord can't help me with that.
You need to make that happen.

137
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:52,916
And you'd better do it so that the Lord
won't take something precious from you.

138
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,666
Unless you want people crying
at the wedding, my poor little Nikola.

139
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:06,250
-I need an ashtray.
-Let me help you.

140
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,041
Ah, there it is.

141
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,250
Easy now, Nikola. Easy.

142
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,916
Seek refuge with Him.

143
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,666
Me and my Winstons

144
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:31,000
We got a real good thing
A real good taste

145
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,375
Men and my Winstons

146
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,916
Me and my Winstons
We got a real good thing

147
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,000
'cause my Winstons taste good

148
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,666
like a

149
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,250
cigarette should

150
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,375
-This is not my thing, Jovana.
-Hold on.

151
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,166
Is it really necessary?

152
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,541
I thought we had an agreement, Dad.

153
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,666
Yeah, but I'm not used to this stuff.

154
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,000
Around here I'm not Nikola
with the golden badge

155
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,708
that you read about in the papers.

156
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:38,666
I'm just Nikola, facing the same problems
as everybody else in this room.

157
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,583
But today it's been four months
that I haven't touched the bottle.

158
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:55,541
I would drink to cope with
all those fucking press conferences.

159
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,250
The pressure on me to solve this case...

160
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,291
...destroyed me.

161
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:14,291
It's been six fucking years now.

162
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:26,583
In the worst moments,
I couldn't recall anything the day after.

163
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,250
That's why I stopped carrying a gun.

164
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,375
And then when...

165
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,541
...I couldn't remember...

166
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,833
...my wife's funeral...

167
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,291
...I knew it was time
to do something about it.

168
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,833
My daughter is soon getting married, and...

169
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,666
-The stuff you make me do...
-Thanks, Dad.

170
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,375
You use that camera
more than you use your gun.

171
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,041
Let me see.

172
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,250
I wouldn't answer the door unarmed.
You're still a cop around here.

173
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,916
This is what I could find.

174
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,833
He's been out of jail for six months.
Which means he's no longer on parole.

175
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
His parole officer had no remarks.

176
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,375
-Is the parole officer clean?
-Who knows.

177
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,666
But the guy waited for six months
before doing what he did to you.

178
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,583
-Thank you.
-What does he want?

179
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:05,000
-They all want something.
-But what do you want to do?

180
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:10,416
-You want to use force?
-No. Let's wait.

181
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,375
You weren't kidding
when you said want to go clean.

182
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,916
Not this time, no.

183
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,916
Customs have registered that Swedish woman.

184
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,041
-She's back.
-So?

185
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,916
Don't know. It's just that every time
she comes around, we get our hands full.

186
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,916
I'll see you at the wedding.

187
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,791
Excuse me, are you looking for something?

188
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,250
Hello.

189
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,833
Can I help you?

190
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,916
Yes, I'm looking for a film.

191
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:15,708
-Some kind of specific film?
-Yeah, like very old.

192
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,666
OK, I think I know someone who can help you.

193
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,125
Just follow me and...

194
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,416
...listen to my instructions.

195
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,833
Just wait here for a second.

196
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,291
You can come in now!

197
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,125
Come. This is the man I told you...

198
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,916
You are his first female customer.

199
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:02,125
Are you looking for some specific film?

200
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,166
Actually, I like music.

201
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,375
He'll try to find something for you.

202
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,375
What about your favorite weapon?

203
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,666
I want something that...

204
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,375
...can hurt.

205
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:39,250
That's a Russian model, Makarov.
A very precise gun.

206
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:46,916
That's a Magnum Zastava .357 model.
Also a strong gun.

207
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,000
That's a Beretta 92F model.

208
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,666
Also a strong one.

209
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,916
What do you need this gun for?

210
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,791
You are listening to P3 Documentary.

211
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,625
On August 8th, 2001

212
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:15,833
6-year old Josephine is reported missing
during a family vacation in Montenegro.

213
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,208
Today, five years have passed
since Josephine's disappearance.

214
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,333
The chances of finding her alive
are becoming smaller every day.

215
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,333
A notorious case surrounded
by massive media hype

216
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,333
that would eventually divide a family.

217
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,958
Years of searching, inquiries and false leads
proved too much for her parents.

218
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,833
They've now written a book
in which the mother blames the father

219
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:40,083
and we are offered new details
about her affair with the detective...

220
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,916
Josephine disappeared on a crowded beach.

221
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:48,166
According to witnesses, a green Hyundai
left the scene at high speed.

222
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:52,666
The police have closed the investigation
and no body has ever been found.

223
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,250
Her family continues to search,
hoping to find her alive...

224
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,250
Nina? Nina, wait!

225
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:18,541
-Please, stop, do it for me!
-I'm not doing anything for you!

226
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,541
You think I don't struggle too?

227
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,708
I just wanted somewhere to go.

228
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,666
To do what, sit and cry
about not doing anything?

229
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,583
You're such a fucking cunt!

230
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,000
What did you just call me?
Did you just call me a cunt?

231
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:44,291
I'm not letting you turn
this place into a burial ground.

232
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,416
The only thing we know
is that our daughter is missing!

233
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:52,125
Do you understand?

234
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:57,791
So do it. Cut down that tree.
See if it helps.

235
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,541
See if it changes anything!

236
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,375
Cut the tree down
and see if you feel any better!

237
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,791
Nikola?

238
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,916
You still smoke the same cigarettes.

239
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,250
Yes.

240
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:46,708
-How long have you been in the country?
-For a few days.

241
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:52,916
We had a deal about this.
I must know where you are around here.

242
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,791
I'm here now.

243
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:03,916
-Are you taking care of yourself?
-Are you?

244
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,791
I'm trying.

245
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:12,375
I heard about that albino girl
that you arrested.

246
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,791
-Who told you that?
-Your colleagues.

247
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,833
I paid them.

248
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,916
I'm very happy...

249
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,791
...that you're looking.

250
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:32,916
It makes me very... Yeah.
It's very nice.

251
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:39,666
-I heard your book is doing good.
-Yes.

252
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,916
You wanna read it?

253
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,375
-Maybe, yes.
-I'll give you a copy.

254
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:54,000
Maybe I should write my own book?

255
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,125
Yeah.

256
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,916
You want to write a book?

257
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,666
I will be the police,
and you can write a book.

258
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,250
Look...

259
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:15,000
This is something we do...

260
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,583
...when a few years have gone by.

261
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:23,000
It's a sketch...

262
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,583
...of how your daughter would look today.

263
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:46,708
Children change a lot when they are young.

264
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:50,583
She will no longer be how you remember her.

265
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:56,791
And this is something that is
sometimes hard to accept for a parent.

266
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:06,916
Take your time.

267
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,708
What do you want with this?
This is not my child.

268
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,791
How long can you stay?

269
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:36,041
I will stay now. As long as it takes.

270
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,541
I'm not leaving
until someone has paid for this.

271
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,000
Begin.

272
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:01,666
Relax the arm. Stronger. Hit it.

273
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:05,166
That's the hammer. Come on, hit it.

274
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,666
That's it.

275
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,166
Relax the arm. Relax it.

276
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:18,125
Pull the rifle towards you.
Towards you, not away from you!

277
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,375
Good.

278
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,833
Enough.

279
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:35,125
This is an M48.

280
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:41,416
Domestic production.
Three times stronger than...

281
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,666
...anything else.

282
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,166
This bullet...

283
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,375
...when it enters the human body...

284
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,375
...it fucks everything in its path. Understand?

285
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,125
I had two of these.

286
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,250
The first one was fired
when you were born.

287
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,250
And this one I saved for today.

288
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,166
Go on.

289
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,583
Move it towards you. Towards you.

290
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:20,041
OK, good. Let's go.

291
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,125
Aim carefully. Good. Don't breathe.

292
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,000
Listen, you little shit.

293
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,708
Did that dog do anything to you?

294
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,791
We only shoot dirty dogs.

295
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,666
Go ahead.

296
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,666
You know, if you were
to follow a busy doctor

297
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:10,666
you'll find yourself having
a mighty busy time keeping up with them.

298
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:14,375
Time out for many men of medicine
usually means just long enough

299
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,166
to enjoy a cigarette.

300
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:21,708
And because they know what a pleasure it is
to smoke a mild, good-tasting cigarette

301
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,791
they're particular
about the brand they choose.

302
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:30,541
Doctors in all parts of the country were asked,
"What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?"

303
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:33,666
Once again, the brand named most was Camel.

304
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:37,666
More doctors smoke Camels
than any other cigarette.

305
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,250
See how mild and good-tasting
a cigarette can be.

306
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,041
What's this?

307
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,541
It helps me think.

308
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,541
When I'm stuck, I hit...

309
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,666
...and look at that board.

310
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,250
I hit...

311
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,541
...and look at that board.

312
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,708
With this I solved a lot of cases.

313
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,666
Not mine.

314
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:29,125
I'm ready.

315
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:36,375
Listen, there is something
you must know about him.

316
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,708
-I don't care.
-OK.

317
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,000
Here.

318
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,791
How does it work?

319
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:57,916
Every police has to try it.
It sends ten thousand volts

320
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,916
in five seconds. This should do it.

321
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,000
-I want to try it.
-You will.

322
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,000
On me.

323
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:16,166
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

324
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,708
You must lay down.

325
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,916
Again.

326
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,375
Again.

327
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,541
You are going to need someone to help you.

328
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,916
Oskar will help me.

329
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,166
He will do it.

330
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,250
Thanks for coming.

331
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:36,541
Why did you want me to be here?

332
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,000
Can we talk about that later?

333
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:56,791
I reread our book on the plane.

334
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:01,916
Did you read the last chapter?

335
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,916
The one I wrote for Josephine.

336
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,583
I would like to read it to you.

337
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,250
'Cause I was thinking...

338
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:19,125
I think I should read it to you.
The last chapter says it all.

339
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:28,666
"Hi, Josephine. I'm sitting in our kitchen,
trying to write down some..."

340
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,166
Alright, I'm sorry.

341
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,916
Read it, and then we'll talk.

342
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,250
"Hi, Josephine."

343
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:52,166
"I'm sitting in our kitchen,
trying to write some final words"...

344
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,000
Final words?

345
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:05,041
"Hi, Josephine. I'm sitting in our kitchen,
trying to write some final words."

346
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,583
"I look around and I see no traces of you.
At least no physical traces."

347
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,041
"We're selling the house
and everything in it."

348
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,375
"Yesterday I was standing
by the birch tree we planted together."

349
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,125
That's enough, Oscar. What's your point?

350
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,541
You wrote a farewell letter
to our daughter who's not dead.

351
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:26,250
That's the difference between us, Oskar.

352
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,416
-Nina, it's time to move on.
-No.

353
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:37,541
No, not for me. And that's why you're here.

354
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:42,916
That's why you're here in Montenegro.
You're here to help me, OK?

355
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,583
You're going to help me.

356
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:48,291
Because I've found him.
I've found that monster.

357
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,916
The monster...from our book.

358
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,541
Did he do something else to you?

359
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:35,916
The wedding dress covered in blood.
Is that not enough?

360
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,541
I didn't mean it like that.

361
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,000
I'll take care of it.

362
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,791
Did you really believe the world
will forget about what you've done

363
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,541
just because you've turned
into some sort of saint now?

364
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:19,041
-Was he alone?
-Yes.

365
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:25,916
He wanted to know
where the wedding will take place.

366
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:37,125
When I was small and I sat on your lap
you told me that your badge

367
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:41,416
would always protect me
from people like that.

368
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:50,250
This is all on your hands.

369
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,041
When stealing from these monsters...

370
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,666
You and your colleagues... Some cops.

371
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,708
I'll fix this.

372
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:33,791
Hi, Nina. It's me, Nikola.

373
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,916
Something has come up. Buy a ticket.

374
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,791
We've got a lead.

375
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:45,375
Light up a Lucky, it's light-up time

376
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,833
Be happy, go Lucky, it's light-up time

377
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,166
For the taste that you like,
light up a Lucky Strike

378
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,375
Relax...

379
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:59,791
...it's light-up time!

380
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,833
Oh, your cigarette.

381
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,541
There's something special...

382
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,541
...when someone else lights your cigarette.

383
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,916
I got married like that.

384
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,666
I got married once like that.

385
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,541
-You mean you met your wife like that?
-Yes.

386
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,583
You know, I don't like
that you make me feel good.

387
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,833
Can you please stop?

388
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:49,250
-What's wrong?
-What do you think?

389
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,833
As soon as I feel a little good...

390
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,916
...something else comes back to me, you know.

391
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,250
My life is not good.

392
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,291
It's not going to be good.

393
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,916
I miss her, you know.

394
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:21,250
I miss her. And that's the only thing...

395
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:25,250
...in my life.

396
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,833
How I will hurt this person.

397
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,708
It's my dream.

398
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,250
Do you understand?

399
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,375
Huh? Do you understand?

400
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,833
Thank you.

401
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,375
You know, I got married like this once.

402
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,375
Someone lighting my cigarette.

403
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,666
Yeah?

404
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,916
It's very nice. I like this lighter you have.

405
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,916
It's nice.

406
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,541
Where did you get it?

407
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:44,000
-I steal...
-Oh, you steal?

408
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:47,708
Did you steal this lighter? From whom?

409
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,791
A guard in prison.

410
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:53,916
Oh, OK.

411
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:59,250
You know, white lighters are not good.
It's bad luck. You should throw it out.

412
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,000
-It's bad luck?
-You don't believe me?

413
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:05,291
-It's OK, I'm bad luck.
-You're bad luck?

414
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:09,416
Well, I really think you should throw it out.

415
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:12,375
-Yeah? Like...?
-Yes.

416
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,833
-You can give it to me.
-Yeah? Why?

417
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,666
You know this story? Famous artists...

418
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,916
...Janis Joplin, Jim Morrisson, Jimi Hendrix...

419
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,583
They all had white lighters when they died.

420
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:28,416
The police found white lighters in their pockets.

421
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:33,250
So it's true! It's really true. It's bad luck.

422
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:35,666
I'll throw it for you.

423
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:40,666
-Do we know each other?
-No.

424
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,541
Good. You did great.

425
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,791
OK, get the car!

426
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,416
Tie him up.

427
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,666
Enough! Get him in the car, Oskar!

428
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,791
Let's go.

429
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:49,833
You have one old message.

430
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,125
Nikola?

431
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,583
I did it. I did it.

432
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,583
I did it. I did it, OK?

433
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:11,666
He's dead. It's over.

434
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,125
I'm coming home now.

435
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,541
Nikola?

436
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:29,791
Were you thinking of shooting me?

437
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,916
-Hell no!
-I thought you stopped carrying a gun.

438
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,166
What do you want?

439
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,916
What's going on with you?

440
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,666
I wish I could hit this damn bag all day.

441
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:51,791
That...I...would...do.

442
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,166
And why is that?

443
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,916
Because the rest of the world
is working against me.

444
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:06,000
Maybe your wish came true.

445
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,916
I'm taking over the case...

446
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,583
...and you're coming with me.

447
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,833
How could this go so wrong?

448
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:24,541
What happened that night with Nina?

449
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:27,375
Justice failed her.

450
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,250
It's time you and I meet.

451
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,583
Don't worry.

452
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,791
This is not going to hurt you.

453
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:25,125
Today...you will...

454
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:30,583
...die.

455
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,916
It's an old model.
Takes a while for it to heat up.

456
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,375
-Where is my daughter?
-What?

457
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:14,916
Where is my daughter?!

458
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:21,291
Where is my daughter?

459
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:24,125
What daughter? What is this?

460
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,791
I have nothing to do with this! Let me go!

461
00:58:56,166 --> 00:59:00,000
Light up a Lucky
It's light-up time

462
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:03,708
Be happy, go Lucky
It's light-up time

463
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:08,250
For the taste that you like
light up a Lucky Strike

464
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,666
Relax...

465
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:14,791
It's light-up time!

466
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:20,375
Man, that smoking enjoyment!

467
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,708
To come out of a good movie
and light up a Lucky.

468
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:25,791
Boy, that's good.
Especially when it's a Lucky.

469
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:45,833
And all this girl wanted and knew
was to play the drums.

470
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,916
Which didn't make her
very popular at her palace.

471
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:58,291
Yeah, she was an orphan
and the only thing that would comfort her

472
01:03:58,541 --> 01:04:01,916
was the sound of the drums.

473
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:05,541
The only thing that the girl
remembered from her mother

474
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:10,416
was the beat of her heart
from when she was in her belly.

475
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:26,291
And the little girl became
the best drummer in the whole kingdom!

476
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:31,791
Then one day, war came to her country.

477
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,916
You're not listening to me!

478
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:41,250
The powerful Ubir soldiers
started surrounding the palace...

479
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:47,791
...and in that moment the girl
thought of her mother's heartbeat.

480
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:50,916
And she started to play the drum like that.

481
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,250
And that drum awakened...

482
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:58,000
...Azdaja...

483
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:01,666
...the big dragon with three heads.

484
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,916
-And in that moment, the dragon...
-Dad!

485
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:09,791
Oh, well, I'll tell you the rest of it
at some other wedding.

486
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:11,833
Run off and play!

487
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:23,250
-Hey, sweetheart.
-This is for you.

488
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:33,541
But this is my last one.

489
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:37,375
What's next? Are you becoming a priest?

490
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,791
I don't think I deserve that.

491
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:46,916
Did I ever tell you how I met your mom?

492
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:49,250
Of course I did.

493
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,833
I need help with the chairs.

494
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,833
Will you give me a moment?

495
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:07,833
I just wanted to thank you for everything.

496
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:11,250
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

497
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,375
Your Swedish acquaintance...

498
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,250
We'd been following her.

499
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,041
She was armed and we had to respond.

500
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,375
We opened fire.

501
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,166
Can I have one more of this? Thank you.

502
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,125
Where are you from?

503
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:40,125
I'm from a little bit of here and there.

504
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,916
What brings you to Montenegro?

505
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:49,125
I was looking for a man, actually.

506
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:52,000
No good men where you come from?

507
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:56,916
This one I met...

508
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:59,541
...is a very specific man.

509
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,416
How long have you been looking for him?

510
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:05,375
For a long time. And then I found him, so...

511
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,916
...I'm happy...

512
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:11,916
-...to see him again.
-Lucky him.

513
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,916
So now that you've found him?

514
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,666
Well, I'm going to return his lighter.

515
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,166
We met only briefly once.

516
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:26,791
-First date?
-Yeah...

517
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:30,000
...or last date. You know how it is.

518
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,916
It's difficult.

519
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,125
Can I have one more?

520
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,416
-Do you have a coin?
-What?

521
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:47,166
A coin...for the jukebox.

522
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:54,708
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

523
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,250
-You want a drink?
-No, it's fine.

524
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:03,250
Thank you. Can I have it?

525
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:25,791
Do you know this song?

526
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:28,291
Yes, but not like this.

527
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,708
People think they know about this song.

528
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,250
-What do they think?
-That it's a happy song.

529
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:38,000
She's dancing, they laugh and dance.
They think it's a happy song.

530
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,916
But it's not a happy song.

531
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,916
It's a very sad song.

532
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,166
It's like the saddest song in the world.

533
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,791
I didn't know that.

534
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,375
It's good for you, because now you know.

535
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:56,583
Friends, here's a wonderful Christmas gift
for anyone who smokes.

536
01:12:56,791 --> 01:13:02,458
Because it says "Merry Christmas
and Happy Smoking" 200 times.

537
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,750
Yes, ten packs of those
better tasting Luckies.

538
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:08,333
All done up for Christmas
in a beautiful carton

539
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:12,458
and it's such a welcome gift
to anyone who enjoys a good smoke.

540
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:16,333
'Cause you know, smoking enjoyment
is all a matter of taste.

541
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,000
And the fact of the matter is...

542
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:20,333
...Luckies taste better.

543
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:26,458
Be happy, go Lucky
for Christmas gifts this year
