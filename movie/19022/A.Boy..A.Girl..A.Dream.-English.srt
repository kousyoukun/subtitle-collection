00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,244
There's still
some key states

3
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,681
that we need
to keep our eyes on.

4
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:33,381
There's Michigan, Georgia,
Nevada, Iowa.

5
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,252
None of these
states have been called.

6
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:43,521
...at this hour, Donald Trump is
projected to win North Carolina.

7
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,481
This is a reliably
Republican state,

8
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,091
with the exception of 2008,

9
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,441
when the state
voted for Obama.

10
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:03,672
We just know that
we deserve to be in there,

11
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,195
and not sitting out here.

12
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,806
Hey, yo, listen. Y'all
know why my nickname is Rock?

13
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,026
'Cause you can always
lean on me.

14
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,030
What?

15
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,142
Oh, shit. Listen, listen.

16
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,499
We're gonna get drunk,
we're here to have a good time.

17
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,588
You know what I'm sayin'?

18
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:56,507
Listen, listen, what's the worst
Instagram account out there?

19
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,596
Who?

20
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,511
What's the funniest?

21
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:03,601
I think that's 'cause
y'all need to see it.

22
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,562
I got the best Instagram
account in the world.

23
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,524
He's like a cornerstone.

24
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,614
Yeah, I'm a cornerstone.

25
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,530
Hey man, y'all ordering food
or what?

26
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,141
You hungry?

27
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,708
- You orderin' food?
- If you wanna eat.

28
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,884
- What you wanna eat?
- Are they hungry?

29
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,321
Man, don't worry about them.

30
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,801
They in their salad days?
She needs a Coke.

31
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,890
These LA girls, come on, man.
You already know.

32
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:34,763
- She need a Coke.
- It's very cold.

33
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,894
She's warm!

34
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,418
Here, I got a warm heart.

35
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,724
I can give you my
coat up until the door.

36
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,638
Then I'm gettin' my coat back.

37
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,292
I got a warm heart.

38
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,121
I give you the coat
up until the door,

39
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,819
- then I'm gettin' my coat back.
- Hey, hey.

40
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,648
Go talk to him. Go talk to him.
Check this out.

41
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,433
You-you about give up
your coat, for real?

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,609
What are you,
like, Prince Charming now?

43
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:58,090
Guess what? Guess what?
I'm gonna get it back.

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,831
- This is some bullshit.
- Turn around.

45
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,268
No, no.

46
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,704
- Oh, damn, Rock!
- No.

47
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,402
- It ain't happening? It ain't happening?
- Nope.

48
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,535
- Nope. Nope.
- This party is fit tonight.

49
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,276
This party is fit.

50
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,149
You want me to
put your jacket on?

51
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,374
I can't even get in there!

52
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,506
You just gotta throw it
over my shoulders.

53
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,508
Bootsy Collins!
Yo, Bootsy Collins!

54
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,861
All right, let me get
my jacket back though.

55
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,559
- Somebody might drive by and see me.
- Yeah, that's true.

56
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,691
Yeah, let me
get my jacket back.

57
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,259
When are we getting
in this place, though?

58
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,782
People know me,
you know what I'm saying?

59
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,958
- Free!
Can't be doing that.

60
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,133
Yeah, come on.

61
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,310
Yup, yup, yup!

62
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,357
Thank you!

63
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,710
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

64
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,847
You in a rush?
Where you trying to go?

65
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,371
So, are you ready
to get to this club?

66
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,506
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this.

67
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,813
Why are we waiting?
Like, let's do this.

68
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,513
I got you, boss.
Why you in a rush?

69
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,126
What's up?

70
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:18,780
What's up?

71
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,697
Uh, where your crew?

72
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,265
What do you mean?

73
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,268
I mean, you just
out here alone?

74
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,487
I mean, yeah. I'm good.

75
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,317
This is really good.

76
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:37,494
I bet. I've never
seen you before.

77
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,106
What, you know
all the girls in LA?

78
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,065
Something like that.

79
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh.

80
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,850
Okay, then.

81
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,200
So, you goin' to the Spot?

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,071
"Spot"?

83
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:53,728
- Spot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I already went out.

84
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,295
Where'd you go?

85
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,603
Across the street to that bar.

86
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,476
'Cause I don't like the lines.

87
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,826
Oh, we don't do the lines.

88
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,743
Just tellin' my new friend
that we don't do lines.

89
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,527
What up, Miss Lady?
How you doin'?

90
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:12,877
- That's Rock.
- I'm Rock.

91
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:15,837
- Nice to meet you.
- We go straight to the front.

92
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,055
We're good.

93
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,056
We?

94
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,538
Thought it was just you.

95
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,760
Me and my sandwich.
Sorry, my sandwich and I.

96
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,327
We good.

97
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:28,850
Okay.

98
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:30,939
Your loss.

99
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,116
- Cass, you comin'?
- I'm comin' right now.

100
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:37,380
- Enjoy your sandwich.
- Thank you.

101
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:39,817
Are we doing this
or what?

102
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,342
- Yeah, we doing this.
- What you doin' back there, man?

103
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,519
Huh? Bro!

104
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,957
How come every time I look over,
you on your phone, man?

105
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:52,003
So what, man?
It's just one state, man.

106
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,571
Come on. We're not going to be
doing this bullshit all night.

107
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,095
We're gonna get in here and we're gonna
have a good fucking time, you hear me?

108
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,358
- Let's rock, Rock.
- Alright, dude.

109
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,490
Let's do it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

110
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,100
Let's do this. Come on, y'all.

111
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,972
- Yeah, let's do this.
- You ain't cold!

112
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,278
You got Cass' jacket.

113
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,066
You look good, though.

114
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:14,156
You know why you look good?
You don't need a jacket.

115
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,986
- She don't need a jacket 'cause she look good?
- Nope. 'Cause she look good.

116
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:21,163
Listen, if you had my jacket--
Look, Cass...

117
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,513
I swear to God,
if she had my jacket...

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,646
- She'd be--
- We'd be taking all her beauty away!

119
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,822
You know what I'm saying?
She's beautiful!

120
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,215
We be maskin' the beauty.

121
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,351
No, you'd be
keeping her ass warm.

122
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,881
Hey Rock, hold up for
a minute. Rock, Rock, Rock!

123
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,230
All right, all right.

124
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:45,883
What?

125
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,278
Just hold up! What?

126
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,021
Mimi, just what? What?
Come on.

127
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,023
I'm busy, yeah.
I'm taking care of our son.

128
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,939
That's what I'm doin',
I'm workin'.

129
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:58,548
What?

130
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,073
Yeah, of course. Put him on.

131
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,424
Man...

132
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:09,516
What's up, man?

133
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,257
Son, what's up?

134
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,434
What do you mean
you're scared?

135
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,696
You're there with your mother,
I'm here.

136
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,002
I mean, what do you mean?

137
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,180
She's screamin' at the TV?

138
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,140
What did I tell you?
Listen to me, Rumi. Rumi, Rumi.

139
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,968
What did I tell you?

140
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,492
What did I tell you?

141
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,712
It doesn't matter
what happens tonight.

142
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,801
Just, you say it with me.

143
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:34,976
That I'm...

144
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,110
That's right.
Okay, and what else?

145
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,634
Exactly.

146
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,070
And what else?

147
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:47,945
That I'm a strong, smart,
loving, black man. That's right.

148
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:50,905
All right. On the count of
three. One, two, three!

149
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,515
One. Two. Three.

150
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,605
Ommm...

151
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,262
All right. So, you better?

152
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,698
- Cass! Come on, man!
- There you go.

153
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:04,222
- Let's do this!
- Look, go hug your mother.

154
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,311
Tell her we got this. Why?

155
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:10,228
You tell me why we got this.
Tell Dad why we got this.

156
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,927
Exactly. 'Cause we got this.

157
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:14,798
All right.

158
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,930
I love you.

159
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,802
OK, goodnight.

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,186
Fucking shit.

316
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:10,714
Fuck...

317
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:15,937
Shit.

318
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,383
Talk to me that way.

319
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,908
Bullshit, I fucking
took care of her.

320
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,399
Yeah!

321
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:48,926
Oh, shit!

322
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,668
Damn! Hey, hey!

323
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,412
You gotta smile more, girl!
Come on.

324
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,066
Hey, let me get that number.

325
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,763
- Hey, yo, yo!
- Let me get that number!

326
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,812
Yo, yo! Hey!
Get your fucking hands off her!

327
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,380
- Chill, chill.
- Your pimp's here now?

328
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,859
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

329
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:12,472
Who do you think you are?
Go on, man.

330
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,736
- What the fuck you--
- Stop! Stop!

331
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,825
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hey, fuck you!

332
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:19,653
Hey, stop!

333
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,915
- Hey!
- What the fuck!

334
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,482
- Fuck off!
- Stop!

335
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,920
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

336
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,704
- This dude right here!
- Ma'am, stand back.

337
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,706
- Stand back!
- No! It's not him!

338
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,969
- Okay!
- It's not him, though, it was them!

339
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:36,060
- Why are you going after him?
- Torres! Torres!

340
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:36,974
Torres!

341
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,369
The girl says the guys running
attacked her.

342
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:43,242
Come on, man.

343
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:46,070
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.

344
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,116
Those guys came up to me
they were trying to hit on me,

345
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:51,075
they were getting, like,
touchy-grabby, my boy came up,

346
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,904
and he told them, like,
to back up. The dude pushed him.

347
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:59,388
So when he pushed him, like,
the dude was aggressive first.

348
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:03,697
- Let's go.
- Come on, man.

349
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,469
- Are you Cass?
- No.

350
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,298
Cass Film, that is you, bro!

351
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,082
Either you or your twin!

352
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:43,519
- Yo, what happened? You all right?
- Yeah, what's up?

353
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,305
Look, I go to USC.
I got one more year left.

354
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,959
And I promise you,
your film was everything.

355
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:51,266
You know they still show it
there, right?

356
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:52,963
So, what's up?

357
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:57,490
When the feature supposed to
drop, man? We all waitin'!

358
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:01,015
You look like a bright kid, man.
Keep right, all right?

359
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,800
- Oh, you keepin' it under wraps and shit, huh?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:07,108
- All right, man.
- All right.

361
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,806
- Stay in school.
- Indeed!

362
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:13,549
Hey.

363
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:15,943
Hey.

364
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,384
- What was that?
- Nothing.

365
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,952
- Yo!
- I said nothing.

366
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:30,044
No, I just-- I heard about,
you did a film or something?

367
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,481
- Can I see it?
- No.

368
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,441
- Why not?
- I said, no!

369
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,139
Look, I'm gonna go back in there
and tell Rock I'm out, OK?

370
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,228
You can stay with him if you want,
he'll take care of you, all right?

371
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:44,493
I'm not-- No, come here,
come here, come here.

372
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:45,799
Hey.

373
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:49,803
What?

374
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,373
Come here.

375
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:03,643
Come sit down.

376
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:06,515
Let's just sit for a minute.

377
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:11,433
Let's just sit down. Come on.

378
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:03,093
Shit.

379
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:20,154
Um...

380
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,115
I'm sorry about before.

381
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:25,855
What?

382
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,163
I said, I'm sorry about before.

383
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:31,687
You're sorry, what?

384
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:36,170
I said, I'm sorry about before.
In the bathroom.

385
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,130
It's OK.

386
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,525
Hey.

387
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,049
It's OK.

388
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:55,755
Yeah, you just pulled up right
in front of me.

389
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:56,843
Where...?

390
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,803
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Where are you going?

391
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,589
Anywhere but here.

392
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,593
You walkin'?

393
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:10,813
Let's go.

394
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,317
How you all doing?

395
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,232
Oh, man, OK.

396
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,801
It's been a tough night.

397
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,293
Thank you.

398
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,515
For what?

399
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:07,870
That was, uh...
that was cute.

400
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,135
- Cute?
- Yeah.

401
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,530
I'm a grown-ass man, woman.

402
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,577
Does that mean
you can't be cute?

403
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:33,766
Home to Detroit, Michigan,

404
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:36,246
Milwaukee and Wisconsin.

405
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,729
It could impede in what
the polls are saying right now.

406
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,992
Michigan and Wisconsin
are so close.

407
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,778
Um, just a really quick update
right now,

408
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:49,956
we have Hillary with New Mexico,
Virginia, Colorado, Oregon--

409
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,308
These are all
no surprises:

410
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,615
Hawaii, California,

411
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,803
Thank you for fighting for me.

412
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:12,892
Thank you.

413
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,156
You're welcome.

414
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,202
The least I could do.

415
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,381
We did not expect this race

416
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:27,820
to be this close,
that is for sure.

417
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,648
Brother, you need
some napkins?

418
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:30,997
I have napkins up here.

419
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:31,954
I'm fine.

420
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,132
What happened?

421
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,351
Ignorance.

422
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,571
That's what happened.
Let's just...

423
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,878
We don't need
to talk about it.

424
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,925
I know all about that one.

425
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,928
What you mean,
you know about all that?

426
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:51,670
What you know about all what?

427
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,327
My dad is Arabic.
I was raised Muslim, man.

428
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,678
I deal with it every day.

429
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,985
The Arabic part helps you out.

430
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,857
Hmm! Does it?

431
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:05,814
Trust me.

432
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,991
Yeah, tell that
to my fam, bro.

433
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,299
Yeah, you can't know what's it
like to wake up every...

434
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,127
every day, over and
over and over,

435
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:17,608
they disrespect you just because
of the color you were born in.

436
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,523
I ain't disrespectin' you.

437
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,742
I'm tellin' you.

438
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,353
The Arabic side helps you out.

439
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,312
Black man in America,

440
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,619
you gotta wake up and act like
the shit didn't happen.

441
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,144
So you can't know about it.

442
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,714
Man, my mom's black.

443
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,069
Try being a black man in America
every day, and then, uh..

444
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,985
being put on a terrorist list.

445
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:50,685
Your, uh, dad being stopped
for no reason, and, uh,

446
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:55,298
your cousins not being
able to come here.

447
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:01,478
It's like being
a black man in America.

448
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,267
This shit ain't OK.

449
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,922
Shit ain't OK, man.

450
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,359
No, the fuckin' shit ain't OK.

451
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:12,881
Hey.

452
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,756
Shit is not OK.

453
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,541
It's fucked up.

454
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,370
But you know what,
it's different.

455
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,024
It's different for you,
it's different for him,

456
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,200
it's different for me.

457
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,942
It's fucked up.

458
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:32,509
God.

459
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,687
Especially now.

460
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,216
It's fucking crazy.

461
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,307
Donald Trump
has always had money.

462
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,440
Do you think-- Listen,
people who are voting for him--

463
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,443
This is for the voters:
he has always had money.

464
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,751
He has never even known
anybody that is poor,

465
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,929
that's middle-class,
that's working class--

466
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,712
You OK?

467
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm fine.

468
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:12,071
I mean, not really,
but I'm fine.

469
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,207
Just tired as shit.

470
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,080
Same old shit.

471
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,996
Every city, same old shit.

472
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,263
Yeah.

473
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,183
- Yeah.
- And he only cares now

474
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,576
because he wants your vote.

475
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,796
And if he wins tonight,

476
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:45,669
because of you, you're going
to find out very soon

477
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,847
that his interests
are not yours.

478
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,329
Welcome to L.A.

479
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,204
Shit. Welcome to America.

480
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,554
Yeah, that too.

481
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,523
Trump began
his unlikely bid

482
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,700
to the White House
in June 2015...

483
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,703
What do you want?

484
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:22,402
What?

485
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,189
What do you want?
Like, what do you really want?

486
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:27,842
Uh...

487
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,760
I mean, does it really matter,
what I really want?

488
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,284
It's not the movies, so...

489
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:36,633
What?

490
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:42,683
I mean, nobody ever gets
what they really want.

491
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,337
Says who?

492
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,775
Who told you that? Society?

493
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:51,083
Nah, man, it's just there's...

494
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,694
things that I know, and that's
one thing that I know.

495
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:57,916
And I ask again,
who told you that?

496
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,048
Everybody.

497
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,791
My mom, my sisters, my dad.

498
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,619
I mean, literally everybody.

499
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,099
Yeah, but you said
you were grown.

500
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:07,795
No. OK.

501
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,581
I am grown.
Let me put it this way.

502
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:15,107
My mom... she had things
that she wanted to do.

503
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:18,414
Things that she
was excited about.

504
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:19,894
She had kids

505
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:21,200
and then,

506
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,115
we came along and

507
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,509
she ain't get to
do those things.

508
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,425
So, how am I supposed to be
just completely irresponsible

509
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,905
and just go after

510
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,689
something that's crazy, like...

511
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:33,516
Just...

512
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,649
- Crazy?
- How can you do that?

513
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,867
Yes, crazy.

514
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,219
OK, so what...

515
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:43,744
What did you go after?

516
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,357
I'm a lawyer.

517
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,447
That's nice.

518
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,152
You hate it, huh?

519
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,157
That why you rockin'
the short crop

520
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,897
with the blond hair at the top?

521
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,943
- 'Cause you being rebellious?
- Nah.

522
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,467
Everybody needs a change.

523
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,168
Even lawyers, huh?

524
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,649
Even lawyers.

525
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,353
What's that look?

526
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,485
It's nothing.

527
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,532
No, it's something.
I mean, it's...

528
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,664
It's like it's different.
Like it changed.

529
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:35,926
What's that look?

530
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,493
I said it's fine.

531
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,890
No, I'm saying it's different.
Like, I'm, you know...

532
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,370
I'm a film director, so I--

533
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,502
OK, could you just
leave it alone, please?

534
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,113
I said it's fine.

535
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,681
My bad.

536
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,425
I make good money.

537
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,862
I own a condo and I'm able
to take care of my mom,

538
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:01,604
and she's the one
who supported all of us.

539
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,041
I'm good. I...

540
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:04,781
OK, so...

541
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:10,091
You got money in the bank.
That's dope.

542
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,746
What do you mean by that?

543
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,531
Like I said, it's dope.

544
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,534
You still didn't answer
my question, though.

545
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,145
Yes, I did.

546
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,798
No, you didn't. I asked you
what you really want.

547
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:26,020
And I said nobody ever gets
what they really want.

548
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,771
That ain't my life.

549
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:39,077
Oh.

550
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,472
So, what? What, you went
after the dream?

551
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,474
You went after what
you really wanted, so...

552
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,823
- Yeah
- I mean, what now?

553
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,434
I'm going after mine.

554
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:49,696
What you mean, "what now?"
I'm going after mine.

555
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:50,566
Are you?

556
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:51,828
Yeah.

557
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:53,961
What?

558
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,355
Nothing.

559
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:58,661
Hmm.

560
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:10,064
What do you really want to be?

561
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,022
I--

562
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,852
Go ahead. I'm listening.

563
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:18,812
Uh...

564
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,164
At one point...

565
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,688
I wanted to be a DJ.

566
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,345
You made me laugh.

567
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:34,262
- I made you laugh?
- No, I mean, in a good way.

568
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,568
That's cool.

569
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,005
- Word. A DJ.
- Like...

570
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,356
No, seriously though, like...

571
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:44,490
At all of my, like, little get-togethers
with my family and stuff,

572
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,361
I like to pull out
my Bluetooth speaker,

573
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:47,971
and like... I don't know.

574
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,104
- Like what?
- Just...

575
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:53,281
- Like what?
- Make people feel something.

576
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,369
You know?

577
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,457
Move them.

578
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,591
Make them think.

579
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,377
Or just have fun
for a little while.

580
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,163
Music does that for me.

581
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,209
Film does that for me.

582
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,082
Touché.

583
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,480
Well...
I don't know, you got...

584
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,178
a playlist? Spotify?

585
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,614
What?

586
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,050
Come on, you're old-school.
You got a mix-tape, right?

587
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:23,703
What?

588
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,010
- Nah, man.
- Yo, Naqeeb!

589
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,838
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

590
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:29,491
Um...

591
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,059
We got a DJ back here.

592
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,147
- Word?
- Yo.

593
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,627
- Yo!
- She got a mix-tape.

594
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,455
I do not have a mix-tape!

595
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,152
Let me--
Let me hear it!

596
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,764
I know you got headphones in
that purse, too. Come on.

597
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,810
Once a DJ, always a DJ.

598
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:45,290
Let it rip.

599
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,772
- Hold that.
- OK.

600
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,560
All right.

601
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:58,955
These things don't usually
do well with my ears.

602
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,566
- Well...
- I got little ears, but...

603
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,655
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do got little ears,

604
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:05,484
but hopefully your music
is big.

605
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:06,963
Oh, God...

606
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,183
- OK.
- All right. Let me know what you think.

607
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,923
I'm in.

608
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,230
- You're in?
- I'm in.

609
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:16,843
You go to the song
you want me to...

610
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,366
Uh... That one.

611
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,499
There we go.

612
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,111
For real?

613
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,157
For real?

614
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:31,988
Yo!

615
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:35,383
Lawyer?

616
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,255
Whatever.

617
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:39,779
Damn!

618
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,828
What's your DJ name?

619
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,525
What?

620
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,441
I ain't got a DJ name.

621
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:52,270
Yo, this is hot!

622
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,844
Your mama know
you're this good?

623
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:02,976
Exactly.

624
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:14,901
Yo.

625
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,998
Hmm.

626
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,268
- Yeah, this is it, man.
- OK.

627
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,617
That's good.

628
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,626
That's dope.

629
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:45,279
Yeah?

630
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:48,674
What's up?

631
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,982
What? You didn't like it?

632
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:58,031
Nah, it's incredible.

633
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,748
No, I mean, it was
incredible. Honestly.

634
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,533
I just, you know...

635
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,579
- My phone.
- I real-- Yeah.

636
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,451
- Right.
- You got a whole life back home,

637
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:29,062
and, look,
this is borrowed time.

638
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,457
OK... Look, I'm not
with him anymore.

639
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,676
It's-- It's none of
my business.

640
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:37,810
Oh, so you're not
seeing someone?

641
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,334
Yeah, I'm seeing everyone.

642
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:44,382
Oh, come on, man, don't be
like that. I saw you earlier.

643
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,471
I saw you on your phone
when I was walking up,

644
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:49,082
and you sounded like
you were all in love.

645
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:49,735
Yeah.

646
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,391
What? Now you don't remember?

647
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:55,871
Oh, OK.

648
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:59,397
But it's funny when you do it.

649
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:00,354
Rumi.

650
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,664
Rumi is my son.
He's five years old.

651
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:06,839
Oh.

652
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,321
Look, I understand that--

653
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:15,064
No, I don't think
you do understand.

654
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,285
You fought for me
the first day we met.

655
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,418
And he's only ever...

656
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,202
fought me.

657
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:27,555
And he's only fighting
for me now because I'm gone.

658
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,706
Oh, my God, that view.

659
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,839
Look at this.

660
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,060
Ohh!

661
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,252
So pretty.

662
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:26,135
- It's so quiet up here, eh?
- Yeah.

663
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,574
Thank you.

664
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:33,708
Hmm.

665
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,585
Look up.

666
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:45,938
Oh, my God.

667
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,332
It's a full moon.

668
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:50,943
Shit.

669
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:54,120
Like a record.

670
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,035
Yeah.

671
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,125
Maybe it's a sign.

672
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,431
Maybe it is a sign.

673
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:06,393
Hmm.

674
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:08,438
God likes music too.

675
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,311
Oh, God loves music.

676
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,415
Wait. Where are we?

677
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:32,593
A friend's house.

678
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,335
Find ourselves here a lot.

679
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,511
After these kind of nights,
you know?

680
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,252
Mm-hmm.

681
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,820
Let's go check it out.

682
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,213
- Let's do it.
- OK.

683
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,748
Ah.

684
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,061
Oh, thank you.

685
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,465
This is it.

686
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:19,988
Let's go in. Oh!

687
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,955
Uh, anybody in here?

688
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:34,916
- Hey, what's up, Cass?
- You got it.

689
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,962
What's good with it?

690
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,703
- You all right?
- All good, man.

691
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,052
This is Free.

692
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:43,011
How you doing?
Nice to meet you too.

693
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,885
Donald Trump
absolutely needed it.

694
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,626
He got it and now,
as we talked about,

695
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:52,107
he has many different ways
to get to the 270 votes he needs

696
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:55,807
to be the next
President of the United States.

697
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,460
Clinton County had a surge

698
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,332
of Latino voters
in the state of Florida.

699
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:02,204
Looks like they actually did get
an increase in Latino turnout,

700
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,902
but it wasn't enough.

701
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,338
In Wisconsin
and, earlier in the night,

702
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,906
Michigan was blue,
and now they're undecided

703
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,211
and they're leaning
towards Trump

704
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,126
and so, that's a big upset,

705
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:14,347
stating that,
you know, Michigan...

706
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:18,220
Uh... I didn't expect
for this to be so...

707
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,792
Hey, guys.

708
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:30,580
But, thing is, if he keeps
winning this, mathematically,

709
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,408
she can't beat this shit out!

710
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:35,803
But she-- He can't win.
I mean that-- I mean...

711
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,065
Come on.

712
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,372
But I mean, if they--
Who didn't vote?

713
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:43,593
Like, who sat at home and
skipped out on this election?

714
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,030
'Cause I voted.

715
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:47,685
You're right. We all voted.

716
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:52,864
If she loses Pennsylvania,
it's a fucking wrap.

717
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,259
Radio silence in Brooklyn
right now at Clinton's party.

718
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,480
A place that was jubilant
and excited just hours ago,

719
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,482
now you can hear a pin drop.

720
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,614
That is not a good sign
for the Clinton camp.

721
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,008
I can only imagine
the devastation

722
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:11,360
going through Hillary Clinton's
mind right now...

723
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,374
We can leave if you want,
you know.

724
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,898
No, no, it's OK.

725
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,030
- Sure?
- Yeah.

726
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:33,208
All right. I'm gonna go...
make us a drink.

727
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:34,732
- OK
- All right.

728
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:40,694
- Whiskey? Wine?
- Wine. Something. Champagne.

729
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,130
We just heard
the list of states

730
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,784
where Hillary Clinton
would have to win

731
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:47,353
all those states
to have any chance...

732
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:48,789
What's up?

733
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:51,661
Good to see y'all, man.

734
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,402
- What's up, man?
- Got it.

735
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,708
What's up, K?

736
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:56,231
- Good to see you, my man.
- You good?

737
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,667
You know.

738
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,582
- All right.
- You know. I'm hanging in there.

739
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,236
- Hello.
- Hey.

740
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,455
Thanks for inviting us.

741
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,152
Of course!
Wait, that ain't me.

742
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,459
Russell invited y'all.

743
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,813
You're not drinking?

744
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,772
I had a little bit.

745
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,686
Now, I'm having
a little bit more.

746
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,427
That's a lot more.

747
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,566
Some big news here.

748
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,263
Huge news.
The AP now projecting

749
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,397
that Donald Trump has won
the state of Pennsylvania.

750
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,703
This is a breaking announcement

751
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,619
- from the Associated Press that cannot be underestimated.
- It's over!

752
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:40,580
This is 20 more electoral votes
for Donald Trump.

753
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,234
All the pundits--

754
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:44,323
This is breaking
everyone's expectation--

755
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,282
Honestly, I never thought that
that would happen...

756
00:46:56,552 --> 00:47:00,034
Hey. How've you been?
Good to see you.

757
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:02,080
I can't believe what's
going on right now.

758
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,603
Crazy, right?

759
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:02,531
I'm gonna start throwing
parties out here and be done.

760
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,881
This is crazy!

761
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,970
It's fucking crazy!

762
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:15,631
What is happening
is so crazy!

763
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,395
We need to see this,
though.

764
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,441
Cass, what the fuck
is your girl doing?

765
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,660
- Wait, what's
- Turn it back on!

766
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,967
Wait, wait, wait.

767
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:50,275
- Can you turn back on the TV?
- Listen, listen, listen, like,

768
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:51,841
I know we're all
watching this right now,

769
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,756
I know we're all caught up
in this right now,

770
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,368
but I think like, we just
need to take a moment.

771
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:57,891
We just need to feel good,
like--

772
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:59,240
It's the election
though!

773
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,981
This is fucking crazy.
I know! I know!

774
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:02,504
But we need a minute, y'all!

775
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,332
We need a minute to feel good.

776
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,812
We want to watch history...

777
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,379
But we don't need
to watch this history.

778
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,946
We need to think
about our history.

779
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,209
We need to think about life,
we need to just...

780
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,080
- feel good, y'all.
- But I am thinking about--

781
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,734
Hey, yo! Hold on.

782
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,432
- Give her a second.
- This is consuming us.

783
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,044
Ma, go do your thing. Do your
thing. Play your-- Play your...

784
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,741
Thank you.

785
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:30,141
Yeah, I hate it. Hey Cass!
Come get her, man!

786
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:31,925
Hey, come on, man.

787
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,409
Get out of here!

788
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,200
Turn the TV back on.

789
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,467
Grab her. Grab her.
Dance with her.

790
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:56,384
Just dance. Just da-- Hey!

791
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,083
Hey! Just dance. Grab her.

792
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,649
Whatever, I mean...

793
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:04,001
The world is not
dancing, man.

794
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:10,355
- Might as well, you know?
- I know. Hell. Yeah.

795
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,096
Watch your drink.

796
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,490
It is, but I mean, you know,

797
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,101
it's not the end
of the world, y'all.

798
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,494
It is
the end of the world!

799
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,762
Cass!

800
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:34,205
It's good.

801
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:37,077
It's good what you did.
Hey, hey, hey.

802
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,905
Really! Don't worry about it.

803
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,254
You did good.

804
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,735
You see,
they're hugging each other.

805
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,388
Yeah.

806
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,349
They're dancing. Look.

807
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,179
He's dancing.

808
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:00,144
You good?

809
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,234
All right.

810
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,633
Sorry!

811
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,987
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

812
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,294
Don't worry about it.
Come on. Let's go outside.

813
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:22,035
Come on, let's go.

814
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:25,343
Wait! Wait!

815
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,476
You turn the thing off and now
you're leaving with the music?

816
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:32,132
We're going
upstairs for a bit.

817
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,004
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Love y'all.

818
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,530
Turn the election back on!

819
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,749
Hey, I'm sorry Cass!

820
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,665
...those 20
electoral votes

821
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,407
get Trump to 264, six away--

822
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:48,453
I like her haircut!

823
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,937
Man...

824
00:51:58,332 --> 00:51:59,638
That was crazy.

825
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:03,337
Yeah, it was crazy.
Watch your step.

826
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,298
We need that, man.

827
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:09,909
- Yeah.
- We need that.

828
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,954
Hey.

829
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:15,697
- I want to show you something.
- Wait. Huh?

830
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:18,047
Ugh!

831
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:20,876
- Let me show you something.
- Sorry, what were you saying?

832
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:23,488
No, take that. Just take it.

833
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,751
- No, take it, take it. It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

834
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,145
It's all right.

835
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,103
Hello?

836
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:32,758
What?

837
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,677
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Look, it's--

838
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:43,725
What are you talking about?

839
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,641
Yeah, well, that was like...
That was your whole thing.

840
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,514
Like, that's your own problem,
like...

841
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,733
Yeah, but why are you
stressing me out like this?

842
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,040
It's so annoying, like...

843
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,088
Seriously? Seriously? Now? Now?

844
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:02,179
Now you're feeling bad? Like...

845
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,486
Dude, what are you
talking about? Like...

846
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:09,273
Why are you stressing me out
for nothing?

847
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,021
Ugh! Are you serious?
Like, really? Really?

848
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:26,290
All right, well, I gotta go.

849
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:27,334
I gotta go!

850
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:05,111
Hey.

851
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:06,460
So?

852
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:10,421
Uh, man.

853
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,119
I had a great time.

854
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:15,513
I had a lot of fun tonight.

855
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:17,558
Probably about that time, right?

856
00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:19,212
You gotta get going?

857
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,214
- What?
- You gotta--

858
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,086
Wait, wait, what were you
about to show me?

859
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:26,480
- Nah, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.

860
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,700
You got a flight
to catch, right?

861
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:31,311
Come on, man.
What were you about to show me?

862
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,791
It's nothing.

863
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,662
Seriously?

864
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:39,841
- Just show me, like...
- No, it's nothing.

865
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:46,108
What?

866
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:47,632
Yo!

867
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:56,597
All right, then we'll just give up
'cause I can see that you already have.

868
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,340
What'd you say to me?

869
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,692
What about that script
that actress asked about?

870
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,346
Your film that
everybody's waiting to see?

871
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,696
It's all over you, like...

872
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:11,699
You came out here
to do something.

873
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,658
Are you just giving up?

874
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,275
Says the lady who...

875
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:29,891
You're not even trying to
follow your dream.

876
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:31,415
Give me a break.

877
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,506
What do you mean?

878
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,899
What do I mean? You're not
trying to follow your dream.

879
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,379
You're living all safe,

880
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,642
you go back to your little
comfy, boredom,

881
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:44,558
basic... what,
nine to five?

882
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,779
You kidding me?
Telling me I'm giving up?

883
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:49,433
Fuck outta here.

884
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:50,999
- Come on.
- Oh. OK.

885
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:52,784
So, now you know my life.

886
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,655
- Yeah, I do.
- You do? You know my life?

887
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,483
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I live here.

888
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,007
The city of dreams, right?

889
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,403
People be like,
"Girl, let's go to LA!

890
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,754
Let's go to New York!
Let's go to Miami, but, whoa,

891
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:11,324
let's not go too crazy, like,
let's not get free."

892
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,022
What you're trying to say?
You're free?

893
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:15,110
- Yeah.
- Are you free?

894
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:16,416
- Really?
- Yeah.

895
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,810
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

896
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:22,379
I'm getting mine, yeah.

897
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,294
You think so?

898
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:36,741
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I see you getting yours.

899
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:40,353
You know what's crazy to me?
I think, um...

900
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:43,051
I think you're safer than I am.

901
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:44,923
I think the closest that
you've come to feeling alive

902
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,360
is trying to fuck a girl named
Free in the club bathroom.

903
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:51,408
So, yeah, I see you.
I see you getting yours.

904
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:01,983
I'm sorry.

905
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:08,555
I saw that kid, earlier.

906
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:11,253
I saw how he looked at you.

907
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,952
He admired you.

908
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:16,128
Hey.

909
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,091
What do you really want?

910
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,054
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

911
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,926
Nothing happened, all right?

912
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:33,319
Nothing. Nothing happened.

913
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:37,149
Everything's always
fucking happening.

914
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,109
I get tired of
fighting every day.

915
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,113
I fight every day.
That's my occupation.

916
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,941
I fight every day.

917
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,988
That's what happened.

918
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:17,363
He really did a number
on you, huh?

919
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:38,558
Hey.

920
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:22,863
Oh, my God!
He did not just win!

921
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:24,735
He did not just win!

922
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:30,131
Trump is fucking
president.

923
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:33,439
Oh...

924
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,274
Wow.

925
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:17,439
Oh...

926
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:29,538
Geez...

927
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,378
I'll follow you.

928
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:46,338
Shit.

929
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:35,996
Hey, hey, y'all!
Hey, hey, hey.

930
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,694
Everybody knows what
it's like to fight.

931
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,522
We've all fuckin'
have fought before.

932
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:43,525
Everybody knows what
it feels like to struggle.

933
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,614
Uh, struggle to be loved,

934
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,226
to love, to work,
to be free.

935
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:52,883
So, uh...

936
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:56,930
we're still fighting, right?

937
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,106
Tonight proves
that it's not different.

938
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,587
So now we know we just got
more work to do.

939
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,503
That means you too, huh?

940
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:05,199
What?

941
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:07,854
That means you too.

942
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:11,945
What you're saying is you got
more work to do, too, right?

943
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:13,338
Yeah, Ray.

944
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:16,341
Real work that we all know
you can do.

945
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,866
- I said, "Yeah."
- Yeah.

946
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:22,913
- All right.
- That means me, too.

947
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,568
Handle your business, Cass.

948
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:37,710
Let's go.

949
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:01,908
Oh, man...

950
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,513
Ohh...

951
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:48,607
Doesn't look as bright
as it was before.

952
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,696
Yeah.

953
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,134
Oh, well...

954
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:06,320
Naqeeb...
you're still here.

955
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,193
Yeah, I got, uh...

956
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,412
stuck listening to all of this.

957
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:14,198
I would've been
a danger on the road, so...

958
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,895
I didn't drive.

959
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,810
Understood.

960
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,681
What is it, man?

961
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,728
How could you not be,
man?

962
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,993
You guys leaving?

963
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,473
You want some company?

964
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,084
Yeah.
Could use some of that.

965
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,912
So how about I order it
and then you--

966
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,567
No, man. I got you.

967
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:37,482
Nah, it's cool. I can--

968
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:39,876
Nah.
Where you all goin'?

969
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:40,615
Hop in.

970
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:42,704
Goin' to Mel's.

971
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:46,404
- I got you.
- All right.

972
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:11,733
Thank you.

973
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:14,214
Of course.

974
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,217
- You said "Mel's", right?
- Yeah.

975
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:18,827
Donald Trump,
after the election's,

976
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,917
president-elect
of the United States.

977
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:24,790
And then Clinton headquarters
in New York City

978
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:28,141
stand on baited breath
waiting for the final word,

979
01:05:28,228 --> 01:05:30,709
that there may
still be a chance,

980
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:33,538
but all they get instead
is a simple statement

981
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,844
from Chairman John Podesta,

982
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,804
saying, "We're not going to have
anything to say tonight.

983
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:41,459
Get some sleep.
We're so proud of you--"

984
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:43,287
Naqeeb, you can turn the heat
down a little bit.

985
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:44,853
Of course.

986
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,247
"She's not done yet."

987
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:49,467
I'm at a loss for words.

988
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,470
I digress,
I go to my listeners.

989
01:05:52,557 --> 01:05:53,775
Caller one?

990
01:05:57,344 --> 01:06:00,173
It's kinda funny saying "Turn
the heat down in Los Angeles."

991
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,612
He's waving
to the public.

992
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,527
There's no question--

993
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:08,529
It's kind of a cold night,
though.

994
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,705
Understand.

995
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,927
...misogyny, homophobia,
the bigotry...

996
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:18,104
This is what we've seen
in real time

997
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:21,281
and through history
with this guy,

998
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:25,198
when he was kicking black people
out of their homes in New York,

999
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,287
when he was piling up

1000
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:30,334
the sexual assault cases
from these young women,

1001
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:33,554
a lot of them are probably still
scared to say anything.

1002
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,383
But what's deeper than that,
Tim, what's deeper than that,

1003
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,212
what I'm worried about is what's
happening to our country.

1004
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,562
What's happening to the people,

1005
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:43,129
to the children,

1006
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,001
because of a guy like that...

1007
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:48,047
Say what you will
about Obama,

1008
01:06:48,178 --> 01:06:51,094
but he won by people
coming together

1009
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:53,792
and believing
in something bigger.

1010
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:57,622
I remember that day
and I know you do, too.

1011
01:06:57,709 --> 01:07:00,407
Trump? Trump will not heal.

1012
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,149
It was his appeal.

1013
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,934
And now,
this country's more divided

1014
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,024
than I've ever seen in my life.

1015
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,025
My job...

1016
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:16,728
we represent bad people.

1017
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:22,473
There's too many
bad people winning.

1018
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,434
...just lying
and hateful and violent--

1019
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:29,610
Too many bad people winning.

1020
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:32,439
And I'm afraid.

1021
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,399
Can't say it better.

1022
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,358
Sums it up.

1023
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,502
God.

1024
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:54,722
Dig even deeper
than that and what do we have?

1025
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:57,812
We have, what, the-the massacre

1026
01:07:57,943 --> 01:08:01,033
of our-our Native...
Native American Indians?

1027
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,731
Dig deeper.
What about slavery?

1028
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:08,388
And the confiscation
of our native peoples' land?

1029
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:12,392
He made
America hate again.

1030
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:18,094
This country is called "the
United States," for a reason.

1031
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:19,878
Think about that.

1032
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:24,143
The first name in our country
is "United".

1033
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:27,146
And, I'm sorry,

1034
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,454
we're more divided than ever.

1035
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,153
And I don't know
what's gonna change it.

1036
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,765
That's all I gotta say.
Thank you.

1037
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:39,245
Oh, my goodness.

1038
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:41,160
Rob, I'm happy to know

1039
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,249
there are people like you
out there in the world.

1040
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:47,166
That this is what makes
America great.

1041
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:49,037
You OK?

1042
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:56,958
I will be.

1043
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,421
Trump promised
to build a separate wall

1044
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:26,423
between the southern border
and Mexico.

1045
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,729
Bringing back
manufacturing jobs--

1046
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:36,955
Feel bad for the children
that have to...

1047
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:40,480
Say the first president
was this guy.

1048
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:08,291
What are you thinking?

1049
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,818
Was thinking how
I named my son after...

1050
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,299
my favorite poet.

1051
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,696
Or how excited I was to, um--

1052
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:27,919
when he was old enough
to understand it.

1053
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:31,531
Yeah, Rumi was one of our
great writers.

1054
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,317
I was thinking how

1055
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,976
there would be nothing better
right now than for my kid

1056
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:44,065
to write a poem, so...

1057
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,297
Oh, man...

1058
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,266
I always tell him
that he's smart,

1059
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:13,051
he's strong and he's loving.

1060
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,278
If he's anything like,
you, then he is.

1061
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,459
It's nice to meet you.

1062
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:33,506
It's nice to meet you, too.

1063
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:19,335
You know what, Free?

1064
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,991
It's safe to say
I'm starting to remember

1065
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,863
why I moved out here.

1066
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:29,432
Why?

1067
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:57,982
So the good people
can win for once.

1068
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,985
The good people
can win for one.

1069
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,205
Amen.

1070
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,862
Naqeeb, you want anything?

1071
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:12,475
Nah, I'm good, man.
Thank you.

1072
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:13,954
God bless you.

1073
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:16,304
As-Salaam-Alaikum.

1074
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,786
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

1075
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,168
Is this...?

1076
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:24,476
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1077
01:18:12,339 --> 01:18:12,992
Wow...

1078
01:18:16,126 --> 01:18:16,561
Wow.

1079
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:22,480
- What are you thinking?
- I mean...

1080
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,094
I need to see this.

1081
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:31,445
- Like, I need to see that.
- But it's not--

1082
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:33,360
The full-length version
of that!

1083
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:36,233
- It's a rough-- Gotta edit it--
- No. No! No, seriously.

1084
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,104
Like, you need to send that.

1085
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:39,627
Send the script.

1086
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,368
It's just--
It's not finished--

1087
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:44,415
Send the script to the actress
from the club.

1088
01:18:44,502 --> 01:18:46,809
Just send it to her.
Send it as is.

1089
01:18:46,896 --> 01:18:48,549
Go for it. Like...

1090
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:54,860
Like... do you understand

1091
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,906
how important this is now?

1092
01:18:56,993 --> 01:18:59,343
And how important art is?

1093
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,911
This is everything,
this is our voice,

1094
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:03,521
this is who we are.

1095
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:05,871
This is all we have left.

1096
01:19:06,002 --> 01:19:09,179
This is important, man, like...

1097
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,964
Just let me clean it up first.

1098
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:12,791
No, man.

1099
01:19:15,576 --> 01:19:17,796
You need to send that.

1100
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:22,453
You need to send that.
Like, you need to send that!

1101
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,715
Seriously.

1102
01:19:25,935 --> 01:19:27,153
This is everything.

1103
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,546
- Yeah?
- Whoa.

1104
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:32,376
Oh, with everything
that's going on,

1105
01:19:32,463 --> 01:19:36,119
the fucking shit
we're dealing with, like...

1106
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,773
we got nothing else.

1107
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,426
We got our voice.

1108
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:42,516
We got what we put
into the world.

1109
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:44,910
We got purpose, we got...

1110
01:19:46,433 --> 01:19:48,000
We can inspire.

1111
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:53,440
It can really change things.

1112
01:19:53,527 --> 01:19:55,442
- You really think so?
- I really do.

1113
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,140
I really, really--

1114
01:19:57,227 --> 01:19:58,315
I really do.

1115
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:06,236
- You're not bullshitting me?
- No.

1116
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:09,543
All right.

1117
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,632
You send that,

1118
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,505
get this thing going,

1119
01:20:15,114 --> 01:20:16,550
and I'll, um...

1120
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:19,553
I'll cancel my flight.

1121
01:20:23,209 --> 01:20:24,167
I'll stay.

1122
01:20:26,517 --> 01:20:28,432
- No, for real, like, I'll--
- You wouldn't do that.

1123
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:33,480
--cancel my flight. I'll quit
my fucking job and stay.

1124
01:20:34,568 --> 01:20:36,440
You crazy.

1125
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,404
