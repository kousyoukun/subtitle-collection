00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,244
[woman continues] There's still
some key states

3
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,681
that we need
to keep our eyes on.

4
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:33,381
There's Michigan, Georgia,
Nevada, Iowa.

5
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,252
None of these
states have been called.

[continues indistinct]

00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:43,521
...at this hour, Donald Trump is
projected to win North Carolina.

8
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:46,481
This is a reliably
Republican state,

9
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,091
with the exception of 2008,

10
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,441
when the state
voted for Obama.

we deserve to be in there,

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,195
and not sitting out here.

15
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,806
[man] Hey, yo, listen. Y'all
know why my nickname is Rock?

16
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,026
'Cause you can always
lean on me.

[Rock] We're gonna get drunk,
we're here to have a good time.

24
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,588
You know what I'm sayin'?

25
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:56,507
Listen, listen, what's the worst
Instagram account out there?

26
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,596
[Rock] Who?

27
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,511
What's the funniest?

28
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:03,601
I think that's 'cause
y'all need to see it.

29
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,562
I got the best Instagram
account in the world.

32
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,614
[Rock] Yeah, I'm a cornerstone.

33
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,530
Hey man, y'all ordering food
or what?

34
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,141
[Rock] You hungry?

35
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,708
- You orderin' food?
- If you wanna eat.

36
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:25,884
- What you wanna eat?
- Are they hungry?

37
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,321
Man, don't worry about them.

38
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,801
They in their salad days?
She needs a Coke.

39
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,890
These LA girls, come on, man.
You already know.

40
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:34,763
- She need a Coke.
- It's very cold.

41
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,894
[woman] She's warm!

42
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,418
Here, I got a warm heart.

43
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,724
I can give you my
coat up until the door.

44
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,638
Then I'm gettin' my coat back.

I got a warm heart.

46
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,121
I give you the coat
up until the door,

47
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,819
- then I'm gettin' my coat back.
- Hey, hey.

48
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:50,648
Go talk to him. Go talk to him.
Check this out.

49
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,433
You-you about give up
your coat, for real?

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,609
What are you,
like, Prince Charming now?

51
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:58,090
Guess what? Guess what?
I'm gonna get it back.

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,831
- This is some bullshit.
- Turn around.

53
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,268

- Nope. Nope.
- This party is fit tonight.

57
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,276
This party is fit.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,149
You want me to
put your jacket on?

59
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,374
I can't even get in there!

60
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,506
You just gotta throw it
over my shoulders.

61
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,508
Bootsy Collins!
Yo, Bootsy Collins!

- [laughter]

63
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,861
All right, let me get
my jacket back though.

64
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,559
- Somebody might drive by and see me.
- [Cass] Yeah, that's true.

65
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,691
[Rock] Yeah, let me
get my jacket back.

66
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,259
[woman] When are we getting
in this place, though?

67
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,782
People know me,
you know what I'm saying?

68
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,958
- [woman] Free!
Can't be doing that.

69
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,133
Yeah, come on.

Sorry, sorry, sorry!

[Rock] You in a rush?
Where you trying to go?

74
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,371
So, are you ready
to get to this club?

75
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:05,506
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do this.

76
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:08,813
Why are we waiting?
Like, let's do this.

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,513
[Rock] I got you, boss.
Why you in a rush?

[chatter fades]

Uh, where your crew?

What do you mean?

83
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,268
I mean, you just
out here alone?

84
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,487
I mean, yeah. I'm good.

85
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,317
This is really good.

86
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:37,494
I bet. I've never
seen you before.

87
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:41,106
What, you know
all the girls in LA?

88
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,065
Something like that.

89
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:43,500
Oh.

90
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,850
Okay, then.

00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,200
So, you goin' to the Spot?

92
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,071
"Spot"?

93
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:53,728
- Spot.
- Oh, no, no, no. I already went out.

94
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,295
Where'd you go?

95
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,603
Across the street to that bar.

96
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,476
'Cause I don't like the lines.

97
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,826
Oh, we don't do the lines.

98
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,743
Just tellin' my new friend
that we don't do lines.

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,527
[Rock] What up, Miss Lady?
How you doin'?

100

We're good.

103
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,056
We?

104
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,538
Thought it was just you.

105
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,760
Me and my sandwich.

- [Rock] Cass, you comin'?
- I'm comin' right now.

110
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:37,380

- Huh? Bro!
- [Cass' phone beeps]

114
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,957
How come every time I look over,
you on your phone, man?

115
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:52,003
So what, man?
It's just one state, man.

116
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,571
Come on. We're not going to be
doing this bullshit all night.

117
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,095
We're gonna get in here and we're gonna
have a good fucking time, you hear me?

118
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,358
- Let's rock, Rock.
- Alright, dude.

119

Let's do it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

120
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,100
Let's do this. Come on, y'all.

You got Cass' jacket.

123

[women chatter]

124
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,066
[Rock] You look good, though.

125
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:14,156
You know why you look good?
You don't need a jacket.

126
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,986
- [Cass] She don't need a jacket 'cause she look good?
- Nope. 'Cause she look good.

127
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:21,163
Listen, if you had my jacket--
Look, Cass...

128
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,513
I swear to God,
if she had my jacket...

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,646
- [Cass] She'd be--
- We'd be taking all her beauty away!

130
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,822
You know what I'm saying?
She's beautiful!

131
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,215
We be maskin' the beauty.

132
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:35,351
[Cass] No, you'd be
keeping her ass warm.

133
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,353
[Cass' phone rings]

134
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,881
[Cass] Hey Rock, hold up for
a minute. Rock, Rock, Rock!

135
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,230
[Rock] All right, all right.

136
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:45,883
What?

137
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,278
Just hold up! What?

138
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:53,021
Mimi, just what? What?
Come on.

139
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,023
I'm busy, yeah.
I'm taking care of our son.

140
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,939
That's what I'm doin',
I'm workin'.

141
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:58,548
What?

142
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,073
Yeah, of course. Put him on.

143
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,424
Man...

144
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:09,516
What's up, man?

145
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,257
Son, what's up?

146
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,434
What do you mean
you're scared?

147
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,696
You're there with your mother,
I'm here.

148
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,002
I mean, what do you mean?

149
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,180
She's screamin' at the TV?

150
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,140
What did I tell you?
Listen to me, Rumi. Rumi, Rumi.

151
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,968
What did I tell you?

152
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,492
What did I tell you?

153
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:31,712
It doesn't matter
what happens tonight.

154
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,801
Just, you say it with me.

155
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:34,976
That I'm...

156
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,110
That's right.
Okay, and what else?

157
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,634
Exactly.

158
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,070

00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:05,814
Trust me.

473
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,991
[man] Yeah, tell that
to my fam, bro.

474
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,299
Yeah, you can't know what's it
like to wake up every...

475
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,127
every day, over and
over and over,

476
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:17,608
they disrespect you just because
of the color you were born in.

477
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,523
I ain't disrespectin' you.

478
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,742
I'm tellin' you.

479
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,353
The Arabic side helps you out.

480
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,312
Black man in America,

481
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,619
you gotta wake up and act like
the shit didn't happen.

482
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,144
So you can't know about it.

483
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,714
[man] Man, my mom's black.

484
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,069
Try being a black man in America
every day, and then, uh..

485
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,985
being put on a terrorist list.
[scoffs]

486
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:50,685
Your, uh, dad being stopped
for no reason, and, uh,

487
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:55,298
your cousins not being
able to come here.

488
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:01,478
It's like being
a black man in America.

489
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,267
This shit ain't OK.

490
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:09,922
[man] Shit ain't OK, man.

491
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,359
No, the fuckin' shit ain't OK.

492
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:12,881
Hey.

493
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,756
Shit is not OK.

494
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,541
It's fucked up.

495
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,370
But you know what,
it's different.

496
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,024
It's different for you,
it's different for him,

497
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,200
it's different for me.

498
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,942
It's fucked up.

499
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:32,509
God.

500
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,687
Especially now.

501
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,167
[sighs]

502
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:40,822
[phone dings]

503
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,216
It's fucking crazy.

504
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,307
[man on radio] Donald Trump
has always had money.

505
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,440
Do you think-- Listen,
people who are voting for him--

506
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:53,443
This is for the voters:
he has always had money.

507
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,751
He has never even known
anybody that is poor,

508
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:00,929
that's middle-class,
that's working class--

509
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,712
You OK?

510
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:05,760
I'm fine.

511
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:12,071
I mean, not really,
but I'm fine.

512
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,207
Just tired as shit.

513
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,080
Same old shit.

514
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:23,996
Every city, same old shit.

515
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,263
Yeah.

516
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,183
- Yeah.
- [man continues] And he only cares now

517
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,576
because he wants your vote.

518
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,796
And if he wins tonight,

519
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:45,669
because of you, you're going
to find out very soon

520
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,847
that his interests
are not yours.

521
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,329
Welcome to L.A.

522
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:54,853
[chuckles]

523
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,204
Shit. Welcome to America.

524
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,554
Yeah, that too.

525
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,428
[man continues, indistinct]

526
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,523
[woman on radio] Trump began
his unlikely bid

527
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,700
to the White House
in June 2015...

528
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,703
What do you want?

529
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:22,402
What?

530
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,189
What do you want?
Like, what do you really want?

531
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:27,842
Uh...

532
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,760
I mean, does it really matter,
what I really want?

533
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,284
It's not the movies, so...

534
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:36,633
What?

535
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:42,683
I mean, nobody ever gets
what they really want.

536
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:44,337
Says who?

537
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:47,775
Who told you that? Society?

538
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:51,083
Nah, man, it's just there's...

539
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,694
things that I know, and that's
one thing that I know.

540
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:57,916
[chuckles] And I ask again,
who told you that?

541
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,048
Everybody.

542
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,791
My mom, my sisters, my dad.

543
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,619
I mean, literally everybody.

544
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:07,099
Yeah, but you said
you were grown.

545
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:07,795
No. OK.

546
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,581
I am grown.
Let me put it this way.

547
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:15,107
My mom... she had things
that she wanted to do.

548
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:18,414
Things that she
was excited about.

549
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:19,894
She had kids

550
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:21,200
and then,

551
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,115
we came along and

552
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,509
she ain't get to
do those things.

553
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,425
So, how am I supposed to be
just completely irresponsible

554
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,905
and just go after

555
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,689
something that's crazy, like...

556
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:33,516
Just...

557
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:35,649
- Crazy?
- How can you do that?

558
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,867
Yes, crazy.

559
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,219
OK, so what...

560
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:43,744
What did you go after?

561
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,357
I'm a lawyer.

562
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,447
That's nice.

563
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,797
[Free chuckles softly]

564
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,152
You hate it, huh?

565
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,157
That why you rockin'
the short crop

566
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,897
with the blond hair at the top?

567
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,943
- 'Cause you being rebellious?
- Nah.

568
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,467
Everybody needs a change.

569
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,168
Even lawyers, huh?

570
00:33:18,344 --> 00:33:19,649
Even lawyers.

571
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,353
[Cass] What's that look?

572
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,485
It's nothing.

573
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,532
[Cass] No, it's something.
I mean, it's...

574
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:34,664
It's like it's different.
Like it changed.

575
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:35,926
What's that look?

576
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,493
I said it's fine.

577
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,890
No, I'm saying it's different.
Like, I'm, you know...

578
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,370
I'm a film director, so I--

579
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,502
OK, could you just
leave it alone, please?

580
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,113
I said it's fine.

581
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,681
My bad.

582
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,425
I make good money.

583
00:33:56,556 --> 00:33:58,862
I own a condo and I'm able
to take care of my mom,

584
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:01,604
and she's the one
who supported all of us.

585
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,041
I'm good. I...

586
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:04,781
OK, so...

587
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:10,091
You got money in the bank.
That's dope.

588
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,746
What do you mean by that?

589
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,531
Like I said, it's dope.

590
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,534
You still didn't answer
my question, though.

591
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,145
Yes, I did.

592
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,798
No, you didn't. I asked you
what you really want.

593
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:26,020
And I said nobody ever gets
what they really want.

594
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:31,199
[Cass chuckles]

595
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,771
That ain't my life.

596
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:39,077
Oh.

597
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,472
So, what? What, you went
after the dream?

598
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,474
You went after what
you really wanted, so...

599
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:46,823
- Yeah
- I mean, what now?

600
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,434
I'm going after mine.

601
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:49,696
What you mean, "what now?"
I'm going after mine.

602
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:50,566
Are you?

603
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:51,828
Yeah.

604
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:53,961
What?

605
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,355
Nothing.

606
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:58,661
[Free] Hmm.

607
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:10,064
What do you really want to be?

608
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,022
I--

609
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:15,852
Go ahead. I'm listening.

610
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:18,812
Uh...

611
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,164
At one point...

612
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,688
I wanted to be a DJ.

613
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,345
[chuckles]
You made me laugh.

614
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:34,262
- I made you laugh?
- No, I mean, in a good way.

615
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,568
That's cool.

616
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:38,005
- Word. A DJ.
- Like...

617
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,356
No, seriously though, like...

618
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:44,490
At all of my, like, little get-togethers
with my family and stuff,

619
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,361
I like to pull out
my Bluetooth speaker,

620
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:47,971
and like... I don't know.

621
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,104
- Like what?
- Just...

622
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:53,281
- Like what?
- Make people feel something.

623
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:54,369
You know?

624
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,457
Move them.

625
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,591
Make them think.

626
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,377
Or just have fun
for a little while.

627
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:05,163
Music does that for me.

628
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,209
Film does that for me.

629
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:12,082
Touché.

630
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,434
[Cass chuckles]

631
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,480
Well...
I don't know, you got...

632
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,178
a playlist? Spotify?

633
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,614
What?

634
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,050
Come on, you're old-school.
You got a mix-tape, right?

635
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:23,703
What?

636
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,010
- Nah, man.
- Yo, Naqeeb!

637
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,838
- That's your name, right?
- [Naqeeb] Yeah.

638
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:29,491
Um...

639
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,059
We got a DJ back here.

640
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,147
- [Naqeeb] Word?
- Yo.

641
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,627
- Yo!
- She got a mix-tape.

642
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,455
I do not have a mix-tape!

643
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,152
Let me--
Let me hear it!

644
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,764
I know you got headphones in
that purse, too. Come on.

645
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:43,810
Once a DJ, always a DJ.

646
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:45,290
Let it rip.

647
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,772
- Hold that.
- OK.

648
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,560
All right.

649
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:58,955
These things don't usually
do well with my ears.

650
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:00,566
- Well...
- I got little ears, but...

651
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,655
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do got little ears,

652
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:05,484
but hopefully your music
is big.

653
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:06,963
Oh, God...

654
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,183
- OK.
- All right. Let me know what you think.

655
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,923
I'm in.

656
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,230
- You're in?
- I'm in.

657
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:16,843
You go to the song
you want me to...

658
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,366
Uh... That one.

659
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,499
There we go.

660
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:24,111
For real?

661
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,157
For real?

662
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:31,988
Yo!

663
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:35,383
Lawyer?

664
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,255
Whatever.

665
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:39,779
Damn!

666
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,828
What's your DJ name?

667
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,525
What?

668
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:49,441
I ain't got a DJ name.

669
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:52,270
Yo, this is hot!

670
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:01,844
Your mama know
you're this good?

671
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:02,976
Exactly.

672
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,283
[phone buzzes]

673
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:14,901
Yo.

674
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,998
[Cass] Hmm.

675
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,268
- Yeah, this is it, man.
- [Naqeeb] OK.

676
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,617
That's good.

677
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,626
- That's dope.
- [car door opens]

678
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:45,279
Yeah?

679
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:48,674
What's up?

680
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,982
What? You didn't like it?

681
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:58,031
[Cass] Nah, it's incredible.

682
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,129
[Free scoffs]

683
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,748
No, I mean, it was
incredible. Honestly.

684
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,533
I just, you know...

685
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,579
- My phone.
- I real-- Yeah.

686
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,451
- Right.
- You got a whole life back home,

687
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:29,062
and, look,
this is borrowed time.

688
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,457
OK... Look, I'm not
with him anymore.

689
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:34,676
It's-- It's none of
my business.

690
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:37,810
Oh, so you're not
seeing someone?

691
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,334
Yeah, I'm seeing everyone.

692
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:44,382
Oh, come on, man, don't be
like that. I saw you earlier.

693
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,471
I saw you on your phone
when I was walking up,

694
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:49,082
and you sounded like
you were all in love.

695
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:49,735
Yeah.

696
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,391
What? Now you don't remember?

697
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:55,871
Oh, OK.

698
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:59,397
But it's funny when you do it.

699
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:00,354
Rumi.

700
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,664
Rumi is my son.
He's five years old.

701
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:06,839
Oh.

702
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,321
Look, I understand that--

703
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:15,064
No, I don't think
you do understand.

704
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,285
You fought for me
the first day we met.

705
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,418
And he's only ever...

706
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,202
fought me.

707
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:27,555
And he's only fighting
for me now because I'm gone.

708
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,706
Oh, my God, that view.

709
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,839
Look at this.

710
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,060
Ohh!

711
00:40:58,412 --> 00:40:59,500
[chuckles]

712
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,252
So pretty.

713
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:26,135
- It's so quiet up here, eh?
- [Free] Yeah.

714
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,574
Thank you.

715
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:33,708
Hmm.

716
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,585
[Cass] Look up.

717
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:45,938
[Free] Oh, my God.

718
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,332
It's a full moon.

719
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:50,943
[Cass] Shit.

720
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:54,120
- Like a record.
- [Free laughs]

721
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,035
Yeah.

722
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,125
[Cass] Maybe it's a sign.

723
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,431
[Free] Maybe it is a sign.

724
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:06,393
Hmm.

725
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:08,438
God likes music too.

726
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,311
Oh, God loves music. [laughs]

727
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:14,967
[both sigh]

728
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,415
Wait. Where are we?

729
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:32,593
[Cass] A friend's house.

730
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,335
Find ourselves here a lot.

731
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,511
After these kind of nights,
you know?

732
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,252
[Free] Mm-hmm.

733
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,820
[Cass] Let's go check it out.

734
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,213
- Let's do it.
- [Cass] OK.

735
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,563
[Cass sighs]

736
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:50,002
[Free clears her throat]

737
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,748
[Free] Ah.

738
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,061
[Free] Oh, thank you.

739
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,980
[Free exhales]

740
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:13,982
[Cass sighs]

741
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,465
[Cass] This is it.

742
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:19,988
Let's go in. Oh!

743
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:24,123
[Cass sighs]

744
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,996
[indistinct chatter]

745
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,955
Uh, anybody in here?

746
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:34,916
- [man] Hey, what's up, Cass?
- You got it.

747
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,962
[Cass] What's good with it?

748
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,703
- [man] You all right?
- [Cass] All good, man.

749
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,052
This is Free.

750
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:43,011
How you doing?
Nice to meet you too.

751
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,885
[man on TV] Donald Trump
absolutely needed it.

752
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:48,626
He got it and now,
as we talked about,

753
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:52,107
he has many different ways
to get to the 270 votes he needs

754
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:55,807
to be the next
President of the United States.

755
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,460
Clinton County had a surge

756
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,332
of Latino voters
in the state of Florida.

757
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:02,204
Looks like they actually did get
an increase in Latino turnout,

758
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:03,902
but it wasn't enough.

759
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,338
[woman on TV] In Wisconsin
and, earlier in the night,

760
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,906
Michigan was blue,
and now they're undecided

761
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,211
and they're leaning
towards Trump

762
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,126
and so, that's a big upset,

763
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:14,347
stating that,
you know, Michigan...

764
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:18,220
Uh... I didn't expect
for this to be so...

765
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,792
[man] Hey, guys.

766
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:30,580
But, thing is, if he keeps
winning this, mathematically,

767
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,408
she can't beat this shit out!

768
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:35,803
But she-- He can't win.
I mean that-- I mean...

769
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,065
Come on.

770
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,372
But I mean, if they--
Who didn't vote?

771
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:43,593
Like, who sat at home and
skipped out on this election?

772
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,030
'Cause I voted.

773
00:44:45,117 --> 00:44:47,685
You're right. We all voted.

774
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:52,864
If she loses Pennsylvania,
it's a fucking wrap.

775
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,259
[man on TV] Radio silence in Brooklyn
right now at Clinton's party.

776
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,480
A place that was jubilant
and excited just hours ago,

777
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,482
now you can hear a pin drop.

778
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,614
That is not a good sign
for the Clinton camp.

779
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,008
I can only imagine
the devastation

780
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:11,360
going through Hillary Clinton's
mind right now...

781
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,536
[indistinct chatter]

782
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,374
We can leave if you want,
you know.

783
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:26,898
No, no, it's OK.

784
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:29,030
- Sure?
- Yeah.

785
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:33,208
All right. I'm gonna go...
make us a drink.

786
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:34,732
- OK
- All right.

787
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:40,694
- Whiskey? Wine?
- Wine. Something. Champagne.

788
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,130
[man on TV] We just heard
the list of states

789
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,784
where Hillary Clinton
would have to win

790
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:47,353
all those states
to have any chance...

791
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:48,789
What's up?

792
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:51,661
Good to see y'all, man.

793
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,402
- [man] What's up, man?
- Got it.

794
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,708
What's up, K?

795
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:56,231
- Good to see you, my man.
- You good?

796
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:57,667
You know.

797
00:45:57,798 --> 00:45:59,582
- All right.
- You know. I'm hanging in there.

798
00:45:59,669 --> 00:46:01,236
- [woman] Hello.
- Hey.

799
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,455
[woman] Thanks for inviting us.

800
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,152
Of course!
Wait, that ain't me.

801
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,459
Russell invited y'all.

802
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:12,813
[Cass] You're not drinking?

803
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,772
I had a little bit.

804
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,686
Now, I'm having
a little bit more.

805
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,427
That's a lot more.

806
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:26,566
[man on TV] Some big news here.

807
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:28,263
Huge news.
The AP now projecting

808
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,397
that Donald Trump has won
the state of Pennsylvania.

809
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,703
- [all shouting]
- [man on TV] This is a breaking announcement

810
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,619
- from the Associated Press that cannot be underestimated.
[woman] It's over!

811
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:40,580
This is 20 more electoral votes
for Donald Trump.

812
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,234
[woman on TV] All the pundits--

813
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:44,323
[man on TV] This is breaking
everyone's expectation--

814
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,282
Honestly, I never thought that
that would happen...

815
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:49,589
[overlapping chatter]

816
00:46:56,552 --> 00:47:00,034
Hey. How've you been?
Good to see you.

817
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:02,080
[woman] I can't believe what's
going on right now.

818
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,603
Crazy, right?

819
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,488
[chatter fades]

820
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:02,531
I'm gonna start throwing
parties out here and be done.

821
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,881
This is crazy!

822
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,970
It's fucking crazy!

823
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:15,631
[man] What is happening
is so crazy!

824
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:22,900
[indistinct chatter continues]

825
00:48:35,129 --> 00:48:36,565
[all shouting]

826
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,395
[woman] We need to see this,
though.

827
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,441
[woman] Cass, what the fuck
is your girl doing?

828
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,660
- Wait, what's
- Turn it back on!

829
00:48:44,747 --> 00:48:46,967
- Wait, wait, wait.
- [people shouting]

830
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:50,275
- Can you turn back on the TV?
- Listen, listen, listen, like,

831
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:51,841
I know we're all
watching this right now,

832
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,756
I know we're all caught up
in this right now,

833
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:56,368
but I think like, we just
need to take a moment.

834
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:57,891
We just need to feel good,
like--

835
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:59,240
[woman] It's the election
though!

836
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,981
This is fucking crazy.
I know! I know!

837
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:02,504
But we need a minute, y'all!

838
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:04,332
We need a minute to feel good.

839
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,812
We want to watch history...

840
00:49:05,899 --> 00:49:07,379
But we don't need
to watch this history.

841
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,946
We need to think
about our history.

842
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,209
We need to think about life,
we need to just...

843
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,080
- feel good, y'all.
- But I am thinking about--

844
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,734
Hey, yo! Hold on.

845
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,432
- Give her a second.
- [Free] This is consuming us.

846
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,044
Ma, go do your thing. Do your
thing. Play your-- Play your...

847
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,741
[Free] Thank you.

848
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:24,874
[electronic music plays]

849
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:30,141
Yeah, I hate it. Hey Cass!
Come get her, man!

850
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:31,925
[man] Hey, come on, man.

851
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,579
[all grumbling]

852
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,409
Get out of here!

853
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,200
Turn the TV back on.

854
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,467
[Cass] Grab her. Grab her.
Dance with her.

855
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:56,384
Just dance. Just da-- Hey!

856
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:59,083
Hey! Just dance. Grab her.

857
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,649
Whatever, I mean...

858
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:04,001
[man] The world is not
dancing, man.

859
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:10,355
- Might as well, you know?
- I know. Hell. Yeah.

860
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,096
Watch your drink.

861
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,490
It is, but I mean, you know,

862
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,101
it's not the end
of the world, y'all.

863
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:19,494
[woman] It is
the end of the world!

864
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,366
[music continues]

865
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:23,759
[chatter continues]

866
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:26,762
[woman] Cass!

867
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:34,205
It's good.

868
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:37,077
It's good what you did.
Hey, hey, hey.

869
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,905
Really! Don't worry about it.

870
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:40,254
You did good.

871
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,735
You see,
they're hugging each other.

872
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:43,388
Yeah.

873
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,349
They're dancing. Look.

874
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:52,179
He's dancing.

875
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:00,144
You good?

876
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,234
All right.

877
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:08,804
[Free clears her throat]

878
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,893
- [music stops]
- [Free's phone buzzes]

879
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,633
Sorry!

880
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,987
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

881
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,294
Don't worry about it.
Come on. Let's go outside.

882
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:22,035
Come on, let's go.

883
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:25,343
[woman] Wait! Wait!

884
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,476
You turn the thing off and now
you're leaving with the music?

885
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:32,132
[Cass] We're going
upstairs for a bit.

886
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,004
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Love y'all.

887
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,530
[man] Turn the election back on!

888
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,749
[man 2] Hey, I'm sorry Cass!

889
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:43,665
[man on TV] ...those 20
electoral votes

890
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:46,407
get Trump to 264, six away--

891
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:48,453
[woman] I like her haircut!

892
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,498
[chatter and TV fade]

893
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:54,937
[Free] Man...

[Free laughs]

895
00:51:58,332 --> 00:51:59,638
That was crazy.

896
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:03,337
[Cass] Yeah, it was crazy.
Watch your step.

897
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:07,298
We need that, man.

898
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:09,909
- [Cass] Yeah.
- [Free] We need that.

- [phone buzzes]
- Hey.

900
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:15,697
- I want to show you something.
- Wait. Huh?

901
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:18,047
- [phone buzzes]
- Ugh!

902
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:20,876
- Let me show you something.
- Sorry, what were you saying?

903
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:23,488
- [phone buzzes]
- No, take that. Just take it.

904
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,751
- No, take it, take it. It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

905
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:28,145
- It's all right.
- [sighs]

906
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,103
Hello?

907
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:32,758
What?

908
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,677
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Look, it's--

909
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:43,725
What are you talking about?

910
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:46,641
Yeah, well, that was like...
That was your whole thing.

911
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:49,514
Like, that's your own problem,
like...

912
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,733
Yeah, but why are you
stressing me out like this?

913
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,040
It's so annoying, like...

914
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,088
Seriously? Seriously? Now? Now?

915
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:02,179
Now you're feeling bad? Like...

916
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,486
Dude, what are you
talking about? Like...

917
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:09,273
Why are you stressing me out
for nothing?

918
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,021
Ugh! Are you serious?
Like, really? Really?

919
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:26,290
All right, well, I gotta go.

920
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:27,334
I gotta go!

921
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,034
[Free sighs]

922
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:05,111
- [Free] Hey.
- [Cass sighs]

923
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:06,460
So?

924
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:10,421
Uh, man.

925
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,119
I had a great time.

926
00:54:13,206 --> 00:54:15,513
I had a lot of fun tonight.

927
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:17,558
Probably about that time, right?

928
00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:19,212
You gotta get going?

929
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,214
- What?
- You gotta--

930
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,086
Wait, wait, what were you
about to show me?

931
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:26,480
- Nah, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.

932
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,700
You got a flight
to catch, right?

933
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:31,311
Come on, man.
What were you about to show me?

934
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,791
It's nothing.

935
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,662
Seriously?

936
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:39,841
- Just show me, like...
- No, it's nothing.

937
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:46,108
What?

938
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:47,632
Yo!

939
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:56,597
All right, then we'll just give up
'cause I can see that you already have.

940
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:00,340
What'd you say to me?

941
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,692
What about that script
that actress asked about?

942
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:06,346
Your film that
everybody's waiting to see?

943
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,696
It's all over you, like...

944
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:11,699
You came out here
to do something.

945
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:13,658
Are you just giving up?

946
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:15,050
[Cass scoffs]

947
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,275
Says the lady who...

948
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:29,891
You're not even trying to
follow your dream.

949
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:31,415
Give me a break.

950
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,506
[Free] What do you mean?

951
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:37,899
What do I mean? You're not
trying to follow your dream.

952
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:39,379
You're living all safe,

953
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,642
you go back to your little
comfy, boredom,

954
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:44,558
basic... what,
nine to five?

955
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,779
You kidding me?
Telling me I'm giving up?

956
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:49,433
Fuck outta here.

957
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:50,999
- Come on.
- [Free] Oh. OK.

958
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:52,784
So, now you know my life.

959
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,655
- Yeah, I do.
- You do? You know my life?

960
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,483
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I live here.

961
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,007
The city of dreams, right?

962
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,403
People be like,
"Girl, let's go to LA!

963
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,754
Let's go to New York!
Let's go to Miami, but, whoa,

964
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:11,324
let's not go too crazy, like,
let's not get free."

965
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,022
What you're trying to say?
You're free?

966
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:15,110
- Yeah.
- Are you free?

967
00:56:15,197 --> 00:56:16,416
- Really?
- Yeah.

968
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,810
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

969
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:22,379
I'm getting mine, yeah.

970
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,294
You think so?

971
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:36,741
[Free] Mm-hmm, yeah,
I see you getting yours.

972
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:40,353
You know what's crazy to me?
I think, um...

973
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:43,051
I think you're safer than I am.

974
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:44,923
I think the closest that
you've come to feeling alive

975
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,360
is trying to fuck a girl named
Free in the club bathroom.

976
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:51,408
So, yeah, I see you.
I see you getting yours.

977
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:01,983
I'm sorry.

978
00:57:06,074 --> 00:57:08,555
I saw that kid, earlier.

979
00:57:08,686 --> 00:57:11,253
I saw how he looked at you.

980
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,952
He admired you.

981
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:16,128
Hey.

982
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,091
What do you really want?

983
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:29,054
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

984
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,926
Nothing happened, all right?

985
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:33,319
Nothing. Nothing happened.

986
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:37,149
Everything's always
fucking happening.

987
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,109
I get tired of
fighting every day.

988
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,113
I fight every day.
That's my occupation.

989
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,941
I fight every day.

990
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,988
That's what happened.

991
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,574
[Free clears her throat]

992
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:17,363
He really did a number
on you, huh?

993
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:38,558
Hey.

994
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:22,863
[woman] Oh, my God!
He did not just win!

995
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:24,735
He did not just win!

996
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:30,131
[man] Trump is fucking
president.

997
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:33,439
[Free] Oh...

998
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,274
Wow.

999
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,856
[Free scoffs]

1000
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:14,872
[sniffles]

1001
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:17,439
Oh...

1002
01:00:28,102 --> 01:00:29,538
[Free] Geez...

1003
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:39,374
[Free sighs]

1004
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,378
I'll follow you.

1005
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:46,338
[sighs] Shit.

1006
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:54,563
[people shouting]

1007
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:22,722
[all shouting]

1008
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:35,996
Hey, hey, y'all!
Hey, hey, hey.

1009
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,694
Everybody knows what
it's like to fight.

1010
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,522
We've all fuckin'
have fought before.

1011
01:01:40,609 --> 01:01:43,525
Everybody knows what
it feels like to struggle.

1012
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,614
Uh, struggle to be loved,

1013
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,226
to love, to work,
to be free.

1014
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:52,883
So, uh...

1015
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:56,930
we're still fighting, right?

1016
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,106
Tonight proves
that it's not different.

1017
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,587
So now we know we just got
more work to do.

1018
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,503
[man] That means you too, huh?

1019
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:05,199
What?

1020
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:07,854
[man] That means you too.

1021
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:11,945
What you're saying is you got
more work to do, too, right?

1022
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:13,338
Yeah, Ray.

1023
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:16,341
Real work that we all know
you can do.

1024
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,866
- I said, "Yeah."
- Yeah.

1025
01:02:19,953 --> 01:02:22,913
- All right.
- That means me, too.

1026
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,568
Handle your business, Cass.

1027
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:37,710
Let's go.

1028
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:40,017
[chatter resumes]

1029
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:01,908
[Free] Oh, man...

1030
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:41,513
[Free] Ohh...

1031
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:48,607
Doesn't look as bright
as it was before.

1032
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:50,696
[Free] Yeah.

1033
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,134
Oh, well...

1034
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:06,320
[Cass] Naqeeb...
you're still here.

1035
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,193
[Naqeeb] Yeah, I got, uh...

1036
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,412
stuck listening to all of this.

1037
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:14,198
I would've been
a danger on the road, so...

1038
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,895
I didn't drive.

1039
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,810
[Cass] Understood.

1040
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,681
[Naqeeb] What is it, man?

1041
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,728
[Cass] How could you not be,
man?

1042
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,993
[Naqeeb sighs] You guys leaving?

1043
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,473
[Cass] You want some company?

1044
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,084
[Naqeeb] Yeah.
Could use some of that.

1045
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,912
[Cass] So how about I order it
and then you--

1046
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:35,567
[Naqeeb] No, man. I got you.

1047
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:37,482
[Cass] Nah, it's cool. I can--

1048
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:39,876
[Naqeeb] Nah.
Where you all goin'?

1049
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:40,615
Hop in.

1050
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:42,704
[Cass] Goin' to Mel's.

1051
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:46,404
- [Naqeeb] I got you.
- [Cass] All right.

1052
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:54,064
[car door closes]

1053
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:57,328
[Cass grunts]

1054
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,156
[Free sighs]

1055
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:02,420
[engine starts]

1056
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,682
[door closes]

1057
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,423
[exhales deeply]

1058
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:11,733
Thank you.

1059
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:14,214
[Naqeeb] Of course.

1060
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,217
- You said "Mel's", right?
- [both] Yeah.

1061
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:18,827
[woman on radio] Donald Trump,
after the election's,

1062
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,917
president-elect
of the United States.

1063
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:24,790
And then Clinton headquarters
in New York City

1064
01:05:24,877 --> 01:05:28,141
stand on baited breath
waiting for the final word,

1065
01:05:28,228 --> 01:05:30,709
that there may
still be a chance,

1066
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:33,538
but all they get instead
is a simple statement

1067
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,844
from Chairman John Podesta,

1068
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,804
saying, "We're not going to have
anything to say tonight.

1069
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:41,459
Get some sleep.
We're so proud of you--"

1070
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:43,287
Naqeeb, you can turn the heat
down a little bit.

1071
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:44,853
[Naqeeb] Of course.

1072
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,247
[woman on radio]
"She's not done yet."

1073
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:49,467
I'm at a loss for words.

1074
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:52,470
I digress,
I go to my listeners.

1075
01:05:52,557 --> 01:05:53,775
Caller one?

1076
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:56,517
[man on radio, indistinct]

1077
01:05:57,344 --> 01:06:00,173
It's kinda funny saying "Turn
the heat down in Los Angeles."

1078
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,045
[Naqeeb laughs]

1079
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,612
[man on radio] He's waving
to the public.

1080
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,527
There's no question--

1081
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:08,529
It's kind of a cold night,
though.

1082
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,705
[Naqeeb] Understand.

1083
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:12,620
[man on radio continues]

1084
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,927
...misogyny, homophobia,
the bigotry...

1085
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:18,104
This is what we've seen
in real time

1086
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:21,281
and through history
with this guy,

1087
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:25,198
when he was kicking black people
out of their homes in New York,

1088
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,287
when he was piling up

1089
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:30,334
the sexual assault cases
from these young women,

1090
01:06:30,421 --> 01:06:33,554
a lot of them are probably still
scared to say anything.

1091
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:36,383
But what's deeper than that,
Tim, what's deeper than that,

1092
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,212
what I'm worried about is what's
happening to our country.

1093
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,562
What's happening to the people,

1094
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:43,129
to the children,

1095
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,001
because of a guy like that...

1096
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:48,047
Say what you will
about Obama,

1097
01:06:48,178 --> 01:06:51,094
but he won by people
coming together

1098
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:53,792
and believing
in something bigger.

1099
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:57,622
I remember that day
and I know you do, too.

1100
01:06:57,709 --> 01:07:00,407
Trump? Trump will not heal.

1101
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,149
- [sniffles]
- It was his appeal.

1102
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,934
And now,
this country's more divided

1103
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,024
than I've ever seen in my life.

1104
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,025
My job...

1105
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,898
[woman on radio, indistinct]

1106
01:07:14,508 --> 01:07:16,728
we represent bad people.

1107
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:22,473
There's too many
bad people winning.

1108
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:27,434
[man on radio] ...just lying
and hateful and violent--

1109
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:29,610
Too many bad people winning.

1110
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:32,439
[man on radio] And I'm afraid.

1111
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,399
Can't say it better.

1112
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,358
Sums it up.

1113
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,753
[woman on radio, indistinct]

1114
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:50,066

[woman on radio] Dig even deeper
than that and what do we have?

1117
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:57,812
We have, what, the-the massacre

1118
01:07:57,943 --> 01:08:01,033
of our-our Native...
Native American Indians?

1119
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,731
Dig deeper.
What about slavery?

1120
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:08,388
And the confiscation
of our native peoples' land?

1121

[man on radio] He made
America hate again.

1122
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:18,094
This country is called "the
United States," for a reason.

1123
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:19,878
Think about that.

1124
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:24,143
The first name in our country
is "United".

1125
01:08:25,753 --> 01:08:27,146
And, I'm sorry,

1126
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,454
we're more divided than ever.

1127
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,153
And I don't know
what's gonna change it.

1128
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,765
That's all I gotta say.
Thank you.

Oh, my goodness.

Rob, I'm happy to know

1131
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,249
there are people like you
out there in the world.

1132
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:47,166
That this is what makes
America great.

1133
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:49,037
You OK?

1134
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:56,958

[woman on radio, indistinct]

1136

Trump promised
to build a separate wall

1137
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:26,423
between the southern border
and Mexico.

Feel bad for the children
that have to...

1142
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:40,480
Say the first president

[woman on radio, indistinct]

What are you thinking?

1145
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,818
Was thinking how
I named my son after...

1146
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:16,299
my favorite poet.

1147
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,696
Or how excited I was to, um--

1148
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:27,919
when he was old enough
to understand it.

1149
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:31,531
Yeah, Rumi was one of our
great writers.

1150
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,317
I was thinking how

1151
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,976
there would be nothing better
right now than for my kid

1152
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:44,065
to write a poem, so...

1153
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,297
Oh, man...

1154
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,266
I always tell him
that he's smart,

1155
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:13,051
he's strong and he's loving.

1156
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,278
If he's anything like,
you, then he is.

1157
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,459
It's nice to meet you.

You know what, Free?

1161
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,991
It's safe to say
I'm starting to remember

1162
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,863
why I moved out here.

1163
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:29,432
Why?

1164
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:57,982
So the good people
can win for once.

1165
