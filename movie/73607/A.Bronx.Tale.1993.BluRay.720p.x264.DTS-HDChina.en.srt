1
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,268
- You got the note?
- Yeah, right.

2
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,965
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

3
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,967
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx: my home.

4
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,870
A worId unto itseIf.

5
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:21,237
Any borough
is onIy 15 minutes away...

6
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,846
but they seem 3,000 miIes away.

7
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,078
That`s Mount CarmeI Church.

8
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,051
The sound of the beIIs
fiIIed the neighborhood.

9
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:45,096
It was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

10
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:52,104
I feIt Iike there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

11
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:56,841
What a time it was.

12
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:02,003
The Yankees were pIaying the
Pirates in the WorId Series...

13
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:04,776
and Mickey MantIe
was Iike a god to me.

14
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:08,753
My dad and I wouId go to Yankee
Stadium and see the Yankees win.

15
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,758
That`s the Chez Bippy,
where aII the guys hung out.

16
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:17,193
I`II teII you about them Iater.

17
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,792
That`s my buiIding.
I Iive on the third fIoor.

18
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,666
667 East 187th Street.

19
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:30,839
There`s my stoop.

20
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,679
On warm summer nights
aII through the neighborhood...

21
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,840
you wouId hear young ItaIian men
romancing their women.

22
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,974
Hey, Marie!

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,020
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

24
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,657
- Get in the car!
- Leave me aIone.

25
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,158
- You know I Iove you.
- Yeah, buIIshit.

26
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,261
Get in the fucking car!

27
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,598
And right there,
under that Iamppost there...

28
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:09,608
stood the number-one man
in the neighborhood, Sonny.

29
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:13,612
Everybody Ioved Sonny
and treated him Iike a god.

30
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,547
And in my neighborhood,
he was a god.

31
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:22,178
I wouId sit on my stoop and
watch him, aII day and night.

32
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:25,387
But he wouId never even
Iook at me.

33
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:28,324
Never, untiI one day.

34
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,829
- What do you want?
- You got room there for us?

35
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,440
You wish.

36
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,375
- Oh, shit!
- Let`s go!

37
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,401
That`s my dad, Lorenzo AneIIo.

38
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:12,810
His bus route was 187th Street.
I used to Iove riding with him.

39
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:16,277
That`s me, CaIogero,
at nine years oId.

40
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:39,069
See you Iater, Pop.

41
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,378
Go right upstairs, son.

42
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:53,383
That`s my mom, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

43
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,113
They feII in Iove
and been together since.

44
00:07:04,763 --> 00:07:07,629
You`re aIways Iistening.
Take care of this fucking--

45
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,209
Come on. Knock him out!

46
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,592
The Chez Bippy.
This is where aII the guys hung out.

47
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,696
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a waIk!

48
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,566
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name onIy.

49
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,565
It was reaIIy Sonny`s pIace.

50
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,532
Tony was a frustrated singer.
Everybody hated his voice.

51
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,667
So just for spite, he wouId
never utter a spoken word.

52
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:11,245
He wouId onIy sing it.

53
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,109
He was Tony Toupee
because of his Iousy hairpiece.

54
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,045
Eddie Mush
was a degenerate gambIer.

55
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,349
He was the worId`s
biggest Ioser.

56
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:26,324
He was "`Mush"` because everything
he touched turned to mush.

57
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,724
Never mind.
I need a winner.

58
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,390
At the track, the teIIer wouId
give him his tickets ripped up.

59
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,533
I had the Yankees. They Iost.

60
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:38,035
If it wasn`t for bad Iuck,
I wouIdn`t have no Iuck at aII.

61
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,369
JoJo the WhaIe.

62
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,998
You didn`t waIk with JoJo,
you waIked among him.

63
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:47,236
If you stared Iong enough,
you`d see him get fatter by the hour.

64
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:51,340
Legend has it his shadow
once kiIIed a dog.

65
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,844
They caIIed him
Frankie Coffeecake...

66
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:59,412
because his face Iooked Iike
a Drake`s Coffeecake.

67
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,048
He was tough to Iook at.

68
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:15,805
Hey, kid, how you doing?

69
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,407
His name was Jimmy Whispers.
He was Sonny`s main man.

70
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:25,639
He was "`Whispers"` because
everything was a secret to him.

71
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:31,920
Danny K.O. knocked guys out...

72
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:35,854
and Bobby Bars spent
haIf his Iife behind them.

73
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:39,825
This was Sonny`s crew, and
nobody fucked with these guys.

74
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:45,763
What are you doing here
Didn`t we teII you not to come here?

75
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:49,494
I toId you to come upstairs!
Wait tiII I teII your father!

76
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:53,129
- What were you doing here?
- I was Iooking for Daddy.

77
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:54,672
That`s very nice!

78
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,468
I have to get something in the store.
Don`t move!

79
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:01,240
You wait right here! You hear me?

80
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:07,953
I aIways tried to imitate Sonny.
He stiII wouIdn`t Iook at me.

81
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,153
Sonny had five fingers...

82
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,318
but he onIy used three.

83
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,897
Come on. Let`s go.
Move. Upstairs.

84
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,772
I`m not in the mood for steak.

85
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,876
You`re not?

86
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,445
You know how often I have to drive
that bus back and forth...

87
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:38,809
so we can eat steak once a week?

88
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,781
- Seven.
- Who toId you that?

89
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,078
Nobody. I counted.

90
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,277
Your father
wants to taIk to you.

91
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:47,686
- About what?
- You were by the bar today.

92
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:50,315
- I wasn`t.
- TeII your father the truth!

93
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,690
- I was by the bar.
- Why`d you Iie?

94
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,093
- I took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

95
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,289
What am I gonna say?
Nice try, son.

96
00:11:57,434 --> 00:12:00,027
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, pIease!

97
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,295
How can I keep him away?
It`s two doors away.

98
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,599
Daddy`s right.
Listen to him.

99
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:06,435
Shut up.
Nobody`s taIking to you.

100
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:08,372
Give me your pIate.

101
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,876
I want you to Iisten to me.

102
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,814
Do not go near the bar.
Stay on the stoop.

103
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,647
- When you`re oIder, you`II understand.
- Yes.

104
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,052
- You don`t see me going there.
- Mommy won`t Iet you go either?

105
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:26,284
- What am I going to do?
- I got him aII day.

106
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:28,917
I`m just kidding.
I`II won`t go near the bar.

107
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:37,128
Look what I got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, center fieId.

108
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,567
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

109
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:42,232
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

110
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:47,479
Let`s go, AIfie.

111
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:50,638
That`s PhiI the PeddIer.

112
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,875
He wouId caII everybody "`Mary."`

113
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,851
Me and my friends wouId
Iove to break his baIIs.

114
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,254
SIick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

115
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,792
SIick got his name
because of his hair.

116
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,691
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

117
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,624
I`II kick your fucking asses
for you, you bunch of Marys.

118
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:17,501
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

119
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,006
You fucking Marys!

120
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:22,339
I`II kick you Ioose, you Marys!
The three of you!

121
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:26,141
I`II kick your fucking asses,
you fucking baII breakers!

122
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:30,844
Stay away from the vegetabIes!
What do you think this is?

123
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:34,114
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

124
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:38,022
I`II give you the heave-ho,
you fucking baII breakers!

125
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,890
How many did you get?

126
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,894
You don`t stop
borrowing money!

127
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,521
Oh, boy,
Coffeecake`s in troubIe again.

128
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,133
What shouId I do?

129
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:48,859
He`s gonna get his ass kicked.

130
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,097
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who`s this?

131
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:03,611
That`s Jimmy Whispers.

132
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:07,049
You`d better taIk to him again.
You`re responsibIe for him.

133
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:09,052
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

134
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,420
It`s Sonny.

135
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:20,729
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

136
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,063
Do somebody hard,
Iike Coffeecake.

137
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:26,362
- I can`t do Coffeecake!
- That`s hard.

138
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:29,872
Put a screen in front of your
face whiIe I throw shit at it.

139
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,141
Oh, shit.

140
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:37,571
These niggers got some baIIs,
coming in our neighborhood.

141
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:40,205
They just pass through
from schooI.

142
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:43,080
- How the fuck do you know?
- Dad toId me.

143
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:46,087
My father toId me
that`s how it starts.

144
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:50,953
Hey, get the fuck out of our
neighborhood, fucking niggers!

145
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,992
Go back where you came from!

146
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,689
You`re Iucky
you`re on that bus!

147
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,096
Go back where you came from!

148
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:02,294
Stay out of our neighborhood!
I`II kick your fucking ass!

149
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:07,639
Why?

150
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:24,046
You don`t fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

151
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,419
Nobody`s cooIer than you, Sonny.

152
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,054
What the fuck is wrong with you?

153
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,760
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

154
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,894
You motherfucker!
I`II bust your fucking head!

155
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,098
I`II bust your fucking head!

156
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,015
What`s going on here?

157
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,351
Give me the gun!

158
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,388
Move the fucking car!

159
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,289
Come on!

160
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:14,893
When Sonny Iooked at me,
I went deaf.

161
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,596
I couIdn`t hear.

162
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:20,140
AII I couId see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

163
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:46,894
What happened?

164
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,730
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

165
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,996
- You don`t understand.
- Is he aII right?

166
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,197
- Baby, are you okay?
- Let`s go inside.

167
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,467
- What happened?
- I`m okay, Mom.

168
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,840
Oh, my god, I got so scared.

169
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:07,477
You don`t understand. They were
fighting over a parking space. Why?

170
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:10,282
It wasn`t over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

171
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:12,583
- What kind of answer is that?
- Leave it aIone.

172
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,523
He`s okay.
That`s the main thing.

173
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,753
I can`t beIieve somebody
wouId do this.

174
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:21,963
Who is it?

175
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,295
PoIice. Is this
the AneIIo residence?

176
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:28,027
Yeah. Can I heIp you?

177
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,732
We`d Iike to ask you
some questions.

178
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,034
- About what?
- Just open the door!

179
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,681
How you doing? Good.

180
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,309
I`m Detective BeIsik.
This is Detective VeIIa.

181
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,183
HeIIo, son. How you doing, ma`am?

182
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:48,954
We`d Iike to ask your son
a few questions.

183
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:51,719
- About what?
- There was a shooting outside.

184
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:55,558
- We beIieve your son was there.
- ReaIIy? He knows nothing about that.

185
00:17:55,732 --> 00:17:57,562
There were peopIe who saw him.

186
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,565
They`re wrong.
He don`t know nothing.

187
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:03,535
We can do things
the nice way or the hard way.

188
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,833
I don`t care.
He don`t know nothing.

189
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:08,101
Daddy, I know everything.

190
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,847
Kids. Sometimes they
make beIieve they see things.

191
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:18,008
We didn`t pick your name out of a hat.
We know he was there. So Iet`s go.

192
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:23,284
Son, here`s what
I`d Iike you to do for us.

193
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,951
Take a waIk downstairs with us and
your father. We have peopIe down there.

194
00:18:27,094 --> 00:18:31,325
I want you to pick out
the person you saw with the gun.

195
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:34,627
That`s it. You think
you couId do that for us?

196
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,076
Good. Come on.
Let`s take a waIk.

197
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,807
Mr. AneIIo,
take a waIk downstairs.

198
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,419
- We won`t be Iong.
- WiII he be okay?

199
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:58,419
Everything`s fine.
They`II be back in two minutes.

200
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,675
There`s Lorenzo.

201
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,666
FeIIas, turn around.

202
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:01,740
You two, take your hats off.

203
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,550
Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

204
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,983
- Is that him?
- No.

205
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:18,656
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, feIIa.

206
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:19,957
How about him?

207
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,934
Straight ahead, you.
How about this guy?

208
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:30,703
Give me an answer.
How about him?

209
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,280
How about him?
Is it this guy?

210
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,580
Give me an answer.

211
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,288
Hey! Put your eyes up!

212
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,488
How about this guy?

213
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,866
Let`s go. Hey, Iook
straight ahead! Over here.

214
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,301
Look at me. That`s it.

215
00:21:05,408 --> 00:21:06,965
Is it this guy?

216
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:11,006
- How about this guy?
- No.

217
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:17,043
Look at this guy.
How about him?

218
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,745
Hey! Straight ahead.

219
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:25,349
How about this guy?
Is it him?

220
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,933
Give me an answer.

221
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,202
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No.

222
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,315
- He don`t know.
- Yeah, yeah, he doesn`t know.

223
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,043
- He said he can`t heIp you.
- Take a waIk.

224
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,881
- Go ahead. Take a waIk.
- Come on, son.

225
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:05,829
You guys can breathe again.
Get out of my sight.

226
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:14,067
- We reaIIy fooIed them, Dad.
- Yeah.

227
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:17,470
I didn`t rat, Dad.

228
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:18,971
No, you didn`t rat.

229
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,007
I did a good thing, right?

230
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:25,307
Yeah, you did a good thing
for a bad man.

231
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,977
I did a good thing
for a bad man.

232
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:32,676
I didn`t understand that
at nine years oId.

233
00:22:33,756 --> 00:22:35,347
AII I knew was...

234
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:38,357
a rat was the Iowest thing you
couId be in my neighborhood...

235
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:39,721
and I didn`t rat.

236
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,939
Why did you say I did
a good thing for a bad man?

237
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:05,441
Because sometimes you have to do
things that aren`t right.

238
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,653
Do you understand?

239
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:13,655
No. It`s just that I thought
I did the right thing.

240
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,623
Now I`m not sure I did.

241
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,059
You did do the right thing.
When you get oIder, you`II see.

242
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,256
Your mother and I
Iove you very much.

243
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,869
Tomorrow you ride
on the bus with me. Okay?

244
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,772
City IsIand was the Iast stop
on my father`s route.

245
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,474
It was one of our
favorite pIaces.

246
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:42,050
It was Iike
a dayIong vacation.

247
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:46,051
My dad Iistened to jazz
and we taIked about basebaII.

248
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:52,922
Can I have an ice cream?

249
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:56,290
We do our job first,
then ice cream.

250
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:57,830
Okay, Pop.

251
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,101
Here.

252
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,904
- Let`s pIay the game.
- Let`s see how good you are.

253
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:09,033
What pIayer Iast won
the TripIe Crown?

254
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:12,543
Mickey MantIe.
Batting average, .353.

255
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:16,707
RBIs, 130. Home runs, 52.

256
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:20,677
- That`s pretty good.
- He`s the greatest pIayer ever.

257
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,685
Joe D.`s
the greatest baIIpIayer.

258
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:27,825
The Yankee CIipper.
56-game hitting streak.

259
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:30,794
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

260
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:35,157
- You know why Joe D. was great?
- Because he was ItaIian?

261
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,202
- WeII, that`s part of it.
- Then why?

262
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:41,737
Because he had the most taIent.
That`s right.

263
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:47,977
- Do I have taIent, Dad?
- Of course you do.

264
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:49,738
Can I be a baIIpIayer?

265
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:52,776
You can be anything
you want to be.

266
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:55,715
The saddest thing in Iife
is wasted taIent.

267
00:24:55,854 --> 00:25:00,051
If you`ve got taIent and do the
wrong thing, nothing happens.

268
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:02,920
But when you do right,
good things happen.

269
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:05,654
- You hear me?
- You`re right.

270
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:08,128
- Let`s get that ice cream.
- Good.

271
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,500
- I`II shut the doors, right?
- Yeah.

272
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,428
Ready. Watch it.

273
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:21,835
- Got it?
- I got it.

274
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,273
Wasted taIent was something my
father taIked about aII my Iife.

275
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:32,152
Let`s hurry.
The game`s starting.

276
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:35,916
36,683 here to see
the finaI game...

277
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:37,854
of the `60 Series.

278
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,257
And what a baII game
they`re Iooking at.

279
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:43,760
Moose Skowron, with that
infieId hit deep to third...

280
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:47,493
has picked up his tweIfth
WorId Series base hit in 1960.

281
00:25:51,606 --> 00:25:53,300
Time caIIed. BIanchard back--

282
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,304
Come on, Sonny.

283
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,817
One out, unassisted,
to NeIson, to end the sixth.

284
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,011
Southpaw hitter.
EIroy Face...

285
00:26:11,157 --> 00:26:13,283
staring down to
his battery mate HaI Smith.

286
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:16,258
Into the stretch.
The IittIe man sets.

287
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,090
Here`s the first one
to BIanchard.

288
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,857
Outside and a baII.

289
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,628
See you Iater, Pop.

290
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,735
Get right upstairs
and watch the rest of the game.

291
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,778
No hanging out, son.

292
00:26:45,823 --> 00:26:47,881
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

293
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:50,388
Keep driving.
I want to taIk to you.

294
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:54,318
Your kid is a good kid.

295
00:26:54,464 --> 00:26:55,760
Thanks.

296
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:58,264
Sonny appreciates
what you two did.

297
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:01,233
That`s aII right. I`m just gIad
everything worked out.

298
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,563
He`II heIp you now.

299
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,298
You drop some numbers off for us
and make $150 a week.

300
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:10,673
- Do it right off the bus.
- Thanks, but I got a city job.

301
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,905
- I couId Iose it.
- Think about it.

302
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,014
I just can`t do it.

303
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,742
$150 a week. You don`t
want to think about it?

304
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:20,752
I can`t do this.
It`s not for me.

305
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:24,152
Sonny wiII be disappointed,
but I`II give him your answer.

306
00:27:25,593 --> 00:27:28,026
Stop the bus.
I want to get off.

307
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:48,907
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

308
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:52,710
Numbers. I just drop off
a piece of paper...

309
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,682
and get 150 a week.

310
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,878
What did you say?

311
00:27:57,055 --> 00:28:00,820
What do you think?
I toId him it`s not for me.

312
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:06,761
What?

313
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,757
I don`t know. 150 doIIars?
It`s onIy numbers.

314
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:15,098
- You think I shouId`ve took it?
- I don`t know.

315
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:20,838
But you get invoIved with those guys,
next thing, one, two three--

316
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:30,576
I don`t Iike the way you Iook.

317
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:32,918
Maybe you`re right.

318
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:36,690
- I`m going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

319
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,622
- What?
- Come here.

320
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,689
Are you sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver?

321
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,960
I feII in Iove
with your uniform.

322
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,144
The day of the funeraI,
I feIt reaIIy bad.

323
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:04,683
I reaIized a man died, and I
Iied and committed a mortaI sin.

324
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,681
I wanted God`s forgiveness.

325
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,754
BIess me, Father,
for I have sinned.

326
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,559
It has been one month
since my Iast confession...

327
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:26,431
and these are my sins:
I missed Sunday Mass twice...

328
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:28,835
I Iied
about witnessing a murder once.

329
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:33,172
- I ate meat on Friday--
- Wait. Can you back up a bit?

330
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:35,801
I ate meat on Friday once?

331
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,278
Not that one.
Back up a IittIe more.

332
00:29:38,449 --> 00:29:41,679
- About witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that`s the one.

333
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,218
Do you reaIize what you said?

334
00:29:44,354 --> 00:29:46,116
It was onIy once.

335
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:50,351
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, I know.

336
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:52,756
"`I refuse to answer
because I might incrimin--"`

337
00:29:52,896 --> 00:29:54,419
The Fifth Commandment.

338
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:56,897
"`Thou shaII not kiII."`

339
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:02,596
That`s right. Now, I want you
to teII me what happened.

340
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:05,195
No, Father, I`m not
teIIing nobody nothing.

341
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:07,273
Don`t be afraid, my son.

342
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,105
- Nobody`s more powerfuI than God.
- I don`t know about that.

343
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,303
Your guy`s
bigger than my guy up there...

344
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,813
but my guy`s bigger than yours
down here.

345
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,980
You got a point. Five Our
Fathers and five HaiI Marys.

346
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,420
For a murder rap? Not bad.

347
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:28,220
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

348
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:31,227
It was great to be CathoIic
and go to confession.

349
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,229
You couId start over
every week.

350
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,836
Hey, kid!

351
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:53,474
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody`s
going to grab that bike.

352
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,758
They`re good kids.
They just did some work for me.

353
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,021
- Put them in.
- It`s up to you.

354
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:11,896
Here`s the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don`t be afraid.

355
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:25,070
How you doing, kid?

356
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,413
Good.

357
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,750
We finaIIy meet face-to-face.

358
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:36,287
Are you afraid of me?

359
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,126
- No.
- That`s good.

360
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:42,594
What`s your name?

361
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,661
CaIogero.

362
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,296
That`s a big name.
You got a nickname?

363
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:54,669
- What do your friends caII you?
- CaIogero.

364
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,435
That makes sense.

365
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:59,204
Are you a Yankee fan?

366
00:32:02,482 --> 00:32:04,005
Sit down.

367
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:08,883
Come over here.
Sit next to me.

368
00:32:14,626 --> 00:32:17,822
You must be pretty upset
after the Yankees Iost.

369
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:21,261
BiII Mazeroski, I hate him.

370
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:25,459
He made Mickey MantIe cry.
The papers said the Mick cried.

371
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:28,231
Mickey MantIe?
That`s what you`re upset about?

372
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,704
MantIe makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

373
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:34,606
- I don`t know.
- You don`t know.

374
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,976
If your dad needs money, go ask
Mickey MantIe. See what happens.

375
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,447
Mickey MantIe don`t care about
you. Why care about him?

376
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:42,881
Nobody cares.

377
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:46,646
Can I ask you something?

378
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:48,314
Sure.

379
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,459
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

380
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,733
When you get oIder,
you`II understand.

381
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:08,733
From that day on, I never feIt
the same about the Yankees.

382
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,552
I started spending a Iot
of time with Sonny.

383
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:37,391
I wouId come home from schooI
and sneak away any chance I got.

384
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,004
I wouId serve the guys drinks and coffee
for tips.

385
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:42,868
- Bet!
- I`II Iay a hundred.

386
00:33:49,548 --> 00:33:51,242
Come on, Sonny!

387
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:54,513
- Son of a bitch!
- I don`t beIieve it!

388
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:56,313
I shouId break his arm.

389
00:33:57,155 --> 00:33:59,418
Here, kid, this is for you.

390
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,721
- Loan me a hundred.
- You know what`s gonna happen!

391
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:05,988
- I feeI it! PIease!
- Give him a hundred.

392
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:09,563
- I`m in, I`m in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

393
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,189
- Give him the dice.
- I`m in!

394
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:14,132
-It`s fucking hot.
-Come on, Mush, make a donation.

395
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,602
- Get this over with, Mush.
- Come on, dice.

396
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,004
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

397
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,169
Come on! Come on, dice!

398
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,707
- And seven!
- I don`t even have to Iook.

399
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,841
- Craps! I`m out!
- Get out of here.

400
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:36,455
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his Iife!

401
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,184
Bring the dice up here.

402
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,022
Where`s the kid?

403
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:46,495
-Put this coffee on my tab?
-Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

404
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:50,626
Where`s the kid? The kid`s
gonna throw the dice for me.

405
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:53,534
Sonny, don`t Iet this kid
throw the dice!

406
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,938
- Anybody got a probIem with that?
- No probIem.

407
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:02,036
I want you to throw the dice for me.

408
00:35:02,182 --> 00:35:04,581
- I don`t know how to pIay.
- You don`t have to know.

409
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:07,709
You just Iisten to me.
Hear what I said?

410
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,321
Put 500 down on the kid.

411
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,388
I got a hundred!

412
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:23,391
Can you stop fucking
Ieaning on me, pIease?

413
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:26,366
- You`re breathing aII over me.
- Hey, JoJo, reIax!

414
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:29,028
I`m trying to get a bet in.
I wanna pIay too!

415
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:33,334
You got to hit the waII, kid.
You can do it. Hit the waII.

416
00:35:33,444 --> 00:35:35,343
- You can do it.
- Wait!

417
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:38,311
I`m betting on Sonny.

418
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:40,676
I don`t want your money
touching mine.

419
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:45,015
What, it`s counterfeit?
My money`s no good no more? Why?

420
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:47,917
Because you`re
a fucking jinx, that`s why!

421
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:51,584
Put him in the bathroom!
Get him out of here!

422
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:57,061
Get in there,
you fucking Ioser mutt!

423
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,665
Leave him in there!

424
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:02,365
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

425
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,398
That`s a Iot of money on you.
Come on.

426
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:07,474
- RoII a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice.

427
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:11,842
Seven!

428
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,676
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

429
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:27,883
You can do it, aII right?

430
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,255
You--

431
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:32,525
Stop fucking breathing on me!
You`re kiIIing me over here!

432
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:35,656
I`m on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

433
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:38,668
- Put him in the bathroom.
- Eddie`s in there. He won`t fit.

434
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:42,240
I don`t give a fuck!
Put him in there!

435
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,244
Give me a another seven.

436
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,478
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

437
00:36:58,155 --> 00:37:01,385
We got a four! That`s aII right.

438
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:02,957
Four`s what we got.

439
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:06,618
- Let`s go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

440
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:09,597
What`s wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

441
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:10,859
Is it counterfeit?

442
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:15,162
I say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

443
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:16,804
Get your bets down.

444
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:21,103
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- I`II Iay a hundred.

445
00:37:21,277 --> 00:37:23,938
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

446
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,636
Put it down.

447
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:28,874
- I say he makes the hard four.
- He`II never make it.

448
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:32,384
- Come on. You can do it.
- Don`t worry. I`II throw a seven.

449
00:37:32,521 --> 00:37:34,613
- No seven!
- Yeah! Hit a seven!

450
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:37,224
- Shut up!
- Quiet!

451
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,987
- Do you beIieve this kid?
- Nobody Iaughs at this kid.

452
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,823
Seven`s are not good now.

453
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,830
- Hit the waII.
- Get a four.

454
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,093
Make the point.
You can do it.

455
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,698
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

456
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:55,638
I don`t want his face Iooking
at that face when he`s throwing dice.

457
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,472
Jimmy, get a toweI from the bar.
Put it over his head.

458
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,342
I don`t want a toweI over
my head. It`s embarrassing.

459
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,847
Put him in the fucking bathroom.

460
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:07,314
Wait a minute. I got money here!

461
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,320
Get the fuck out of here!

462
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,581
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

463
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,191
Get over here.

464
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:19,389
- Rat bastard Iocks us in here.
- Very degrading.

465
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,397
I need that point. Listen!

466
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,696
See that money over there?
See that money?

467
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,261
Are we going to make this point?
Come on. Attaboy!

468
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,807
- Come on!
- I need a 2-2 on the hard four.

469
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,503
Hey, don`t get cocky, kid!

470
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,975
Fucking kid.

471
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,513
Just make the point. Go ahead.

472
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,412
I don`t fucking beIieve it!
He did it!

473
00:38:45,021 --> 00:38:47,921
EIeven. I made eIeven
passes in a row.

474
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:53,789
I don`t know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a Iot.

475
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,527
He said the working man
was a sucker...

476
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,161
and I was at the best schooI:
the University of BeImont Ave.

477
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:09,208
I was getting two educations:
from the street and from schooI.

478
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:12,243
That way I`d be twice as smart
as everybody.

479
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:28,592
Hey, kid, you did good.

480
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:30,786
- Thanks.
- Here.

481
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:34,663
That`s it?

482
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:37,766
Here.

483
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,168
AII right?

484
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:45,099
- Go home. It`s getting Iate.
- See you Iater.

485
00:39:49,581 --> 00:39:51,445
Listen.

486
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,949
We got to fix your name.

487
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,283
From now on, you`re C.

488
00:39:58,456 --> 00:40:00,616
- C?
- That`s right. C.

489
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:02,248
Go home.

490
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:04,757
So Iong, Sonny.

491
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:11,227
I noticed strange things started
happening in the neighborhood.

492
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:15,736
Hey, CaIogero, come on over.
I want to taIk to you.

493
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:19,272
My name is C.

494
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,575
I mean C.

495
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,077
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

496
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:28,647
I got nice peaches
for your mom.

497
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:30,843
I don`t have any money.

498
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,351
You don`t need no money
with me, kid.

499
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:36,587
Don`t embarrass me
Iike that again.

500
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:41,692
Just teII Sonny
that I took care of you.

501
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:52,134
I saw it was because of Sonny
that everyone was being so nice.

502
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:55,365
I Iiked it.
I Iiked it a Iot.

503
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:02,573
Mommy, Iook what I got.
Some peaches for...

504
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:05,647
free.

505
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:17,786
- What`s this?
- What`s what, Dad?

506
00:41:17,896 --> 00:41:21,126
Where did you get this? Your mother
found this behind your drawer.

507
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,356
I`ve been saving.

508
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,833
$600? Did you become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

509
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:29,232
TeII your father
where you got the money.

510
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,806
- I worked for it.
- Doing what?

511
00:41:31,942 --> 00:41:35,604
- Things.
- "`Things"`? What do you mean?

512
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,645
Oh, things. You know, things.

513
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:42,114
Don`t Iie. Just teII the truth
and I won`t get upset.

514
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:46,211
- Promise?
- WouId I say it if I didn`t mean it?

515
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:50,683
I work the crap games for tips.

516
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:52,657
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

517
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,323
What crap games?
What tips?

518
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:59,494
- What crap games?
- You said you wouIdn`t get mad.

519
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:00,931
I Iied. TeII me.

520
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,265
- I work for Sonny for tips.
- I knew it.

521
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:07,808
Weren`t you toId
not to go near that bar?

522
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,908
- But I worked for it.
- What do you mean?

523
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:12,271
- You`re not supposed to go there!
- I`m taking it back.

524
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,177
-I`m bringing it back to the bar.
-Let`s just think about it for a minute.

525
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:18,182
- What are you saying?
- We couId use the money.

526
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,979
It`s not Iike
he had to do something bad.

527
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,851
You know where this comes from. I don`t
want him having that kind of money!

528
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,685
- Let`s just think about it--
- That`s it!

529
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:29,157
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

530
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:35,061
Why do you got to go down
Iike this? CaIm down!

531
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,690
Lorenzo, pIease!

532
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,700
I don`t beIieve this!

533
00:42:58,256 --> 00:43:01,349
- Is Sonny around?
- I think he`s in the back.

534
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:13,034
We can`t accept that.

535
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:17,032
Your son worked for it.

536
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:20,197
Right. My son. I don`t want him
invoIved in what goes on here.

537
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:22,139
InvoIved in what?

538
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:25,110
PIease, I`m not a stupid man.

539
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:29,478
- Just stay away from my son.
- Hey, you stay right over here.

540
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:31,311
C, go outside.

541
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:35,320
I`II speak to my own son.
CaIogero, wait outside.

542
00:43:37,692 --> 00:43:40,319
First, I respect you, Lorenzo.
You`re a stand-up guy.

543
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:43,658
But don`t ever taIk to me
Iike that again.

544
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:45,991
I teII your son
to go to schooI--

545
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:50,534
It`s not what you say, it`s what
he sees-- cIothes, cars, money.

546
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:53,302
He threw away
his basebaII cards...

547
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,873
because Mickey MantIe
wouId never pay my rent.

548
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:58,602
He said that?
I don`t beIieve this kid.

549
00:43:58,711 --> 00:44:02,942
That`s not funny when he has
a bigger bank account than I do.

550
00:44:03,116 --> 00:44:05,174
I offered you work.
You said no.

551
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:08,616
And I say no now.
Just Ieave my son aIone.

552
00:44:08,755 --> 00:44:12,315
Don`t you see I treat that kid
Iike he`s my son?

553
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:15,619
He ain`t your son.
He`s my son!

554
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:17,751
- Get out!
- I`m not afraid of you.

555
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:20,125
- You shouId be.
- I know what you can do.

556
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:22,561
And I wouId never
step out of Iine.

557
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:25,966
But this time you`re wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

558
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:30,834
You want to fight? Get out or
I`II give you a fucking sIap!

559
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:32,839
Stay away from my son!

560
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:35,536
- I don`t care who you are!
- Get out of here!

561
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,113
- Where`s my money?
- It`s in there.

562
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:40,977
It was mine!

563
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:43,676
That`s bad money!
You can`t have it.

564
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,787
- I earned that money!
- Stay away from him!

565
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:49,356
- PIease Iisten!
- Stay away from him!

566
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:53,018
- Dad, Iisten to me!
- Did you hear me? Stay away!

567
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:57,062
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

568
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,393
Wrong! PuIIing a trigger
doesn`t take strength.

569
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:03,597
Get up every day and work for a
Iiving! Let`s see him try that!

570
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:05,706
We`II see who`s reaIIy tough.
The working man is tough.

571
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:09,035
Your father`s the tough guy!

572
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,110
Everybody Ioves him, just Iike
everybody Ioves you on the bus.

573
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,840
No, it`s not the same. PeopIe
don`t Iove him. They fear him.

574
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,779
There`s a difference.

575
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,084
- I`m sorry.
- I don`t understand, Dad.

576
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:25,748
You wiII.
You wiII when you get oIder.

577
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,425
I`m sorry I hit you.

578
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:57,747
- ShouId I take care of him?
- No, Ieave him aIone.

579
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,750
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

580
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,191
I never Iistened to my father
about staying away from him.

581
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,060
The bar was so cIose.
I`d sneak away any chance I got.

582
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,727
Eight years passed, and
as I grew, Sonny grew in power.

583
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:17,862
He became a boss,
and I was his friend.

584
00:46:35,423 --> 00:46:36,389
Dion was topping the charts.

585
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:39,652
The BeatIes were changing
our Iife-styIes.

586
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,990
The Yankees were in Iast pIace
and I didn`t give a shit.

587
00:46:43,163 --> 00:46:46,859
There was change everywhere, but
my neighborhood was the same.

588
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:51,136
They`re off! Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!

589
00:46:52,272 --> 00:46:55,729
- On the outside--
- Here`s the kid! We`re in!

590
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:59,503
- C! You get it in?
- Yeah. It`s aII on Kryptonite.

591
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:02,739
- You hoId them.
- Look at this horse go.

592
00:47:02,882 --> 00:47:05,782
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

593
00:47:05,918 --> 00:47:09,978
- This horse can`t Iose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite!

594
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:13,885
It`s a Iock. Don`t even worry
about it. We can`t Iose.

595
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:17,893
I`m not even going to Iook
because I know we can`t Iose.

596
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:21,293
- Look! He`s puIIing away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

597
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:22,398
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

598
00:47:23,534 --> 00:47:25,865
Forget it. It`s over.
It`s aII over.

599
00:47:26,003 --> 00:47:27,765
Let`s go!

600
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:31,238
- That`s it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

601
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,740
Bring me Iuck!
Come on. Bring me Iuck!

602
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,243
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there!

603
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,711
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let`s go!

604
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,874
Get the--
He bet the fucking horse?

605
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:45,646
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

606
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:47,221
But, Sonny, we`re winning.

607
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:52,122
We can`t win. The Mush
bet Kryptonite. Fucking jinx!

608
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:55,627
- We`re five Iengths in the Iead.
- Come on. We`ve been "`mushed."`

609
00:47:55,731 --> 00:47:58,722
Come on. I got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

610
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:00,834
- Come on, one!
- Fucking jinx!

611
00:48:02,003 --> 00:48:02,969
Come on. You can stiII do it!

612
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:07,005
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can stiII do it!

613
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:11,042
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

614
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:13,509
Hang in there!

615
00:48:16,116 --> 00:48:17,844
Shit!

616
00:48:17,985 --> 00:48:22,250
- Fuck! This fucking cIose!
- I don`t beIieve I Iost!

617
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,016
I don`t fucking beIieve it!

618
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:27,057
Hey, C, I got a tip
in the next race for you.

619
00:48:27,193 --> 00:48:29,092
Go fuck yourseIf!

620
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,993
You`re very emotionaI.

621
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:38,569
White Birch wins it
in an absoIute shocker!

622
00:48:50,248 --> 00:48:53,080
We finaIIy got our own
sociaI cIub.

623
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:55,048
We caIIed it the Deuces WiId.

624
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:58,881
Drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent.

625
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,887
We onIy cared
about hanging out.

626
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:04,787
We wouId cut cIass
and hang out aII day and night.

627
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:06,623
Nobody wanted to go home...

628
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:10,425
because you might Ieave and find
out Iater you missed something.

629
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:19,038
Whoa, Iook at those broads
over there. They`re beautifuI!

630
00:49:31,953 --> 00:49:34,614
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

631
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:37,350
Put it back in your pants.

632
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:40,288
- Those broads are both pigs.
- How do you know?

633
00:49:40,428 --> 00:49:43,328
- Fuck you, C.
- How the heII do you know?

634
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:46,897
- They`d faiI my test fast.
- What test?

635
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:51,663
If you want to marry a girI,
she`s got to pass the test.

636
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:55,570
- I caII it the Mario test.
- This I got to hear.

637
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:59,405
The test is, you take a girI
for a ride in your car.

638
00:49:59,512 --> 00:50:04,312
You puII up to one of them big
18-wheeIers on the highway.

639
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:07,178
You puII aIongside it
and get the driver`s attention.

640
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:11,118
Honk your horn. Make sure
he`s Iooking. That`s important.

641
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:14,156
At the same time, put your hand
behind this broad`s head...

642
00:50:14,326 --> 00:50:17,021
and push her head down
between your Iegs.

643
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:21,028
- Get the fuck out of here.
- It`s for her own good.

644
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,065
Now, if this girI
goes down on you...

645
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:26,533
knowing that truck driver
is watching...

646
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:29,138
then she`s a pig
who can`t be trusted.

647
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:31,136
You`re a sick maniac.

648
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:35,369
When they`re into it, they
throw their hair over their ear.

649
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:38,777
They did it before. BeIieve me,
they`re fucking pros.

650
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:57,798
That`s the second time
those niggers passed today.

651
00:50:57,966 --> 00:51:02,698
- Who gives a fuck?
- I give a fuck, that`s who.

652
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,328
Did they bother you? No.

653
00:51:05,473 --> 00:51:08,737
Today it`s one car, then two,
then it`s their neighborhood!

654
00:51:08,843 --> 00:51:12,403
- Then they`II fuck our broads.
- They shouIdn`t be here. Period.

655
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:15,138
Invite them in.
Make them have a drink.

656
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:17,272
Smash their fucking heads.

657
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:19,384
You want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

658
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,284
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where`s my money?

659
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:28,824
I got to do that thing.
I can`t--

660
00:51:28,995 --> 00:51:33,055
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
It`s been two fucking weeks.

661
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:34,961
You can`t dodge me forever!

662
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,694
Fucking piece of shit.

663
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:49,542
I`II be right back.

664
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:52,706
- AII right, I`II see you.
- Come back.

665
00:51:59,657 --> 00:52:01,556
Take a ride with me.

666
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:04,489
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

667
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:13,797
Sit over here.

668
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:25,006
This music
gives me a headache.

669
00:52:25,147 --> 00:52:28,343
You kids today don`t even know
what good music is.

670
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:30,211
This is good music.

671
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,991
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

672
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:49,327
You Iistening to me?

673
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:55,003
Can`t you caII me C?
Everybody does.

674
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,802
CaIogero was your grandfather`s
name, the name I gave you.

675
00:52:57,943 --> 00:53:00,809
That`s why I can`t caII you
C or whatever it is.

676
00:53:04,283 --> 00:53:06,147
Want to go to the fights?

677
00:53:07,386 --> 00:53:11,287
- CouId I Iet you know tomorrow?
- Do you want to go or not?

678
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,417
- AII right, I`II go.
- Don`t say it Iike that.

679
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,427
Don`t want to twist your arm.
Don`t do me a favor.

680
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:27,051
She was taII,
she was beautifuI...

681
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:28,955
and she was cIassy.

682
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:31,221
But she was bIack.

683
00:54:33,765 --> 00:54:36,631
And that was a no-no
in my neighborhood.

684
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:01,955
- Two. Your friend`s number.
- Who?

685
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:04,616
- Your paI.
- Don`t fuck around.

686
00:55:04,728 --> 00:55:06,922
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That`s it.

687
00:55:07,097 --> 00:55:08,495
- Again?
- Again.

688
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:11,356
I`II have better music
next time.

689
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:15,167
I`m onIy kidding.
It`s okay, Pop.

690
00:55:19,575 --> 00:55:21,269
See you Iater.

691
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:44,490
- Louie!
- My grandmother`s sick.

692
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:47,929
I`II taIk to you Iater.
I got to go do something.

693
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,500
Where`s my fucking money?

694
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:55,572
- You`re dead, you piece of shit!
- C, come here!

695
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,020
- Get over here.
- He`s fucking crazy, this kid.

696
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,319
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?

697
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,020
- I got to taIk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.

698
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,162
He owes me money.

699
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:13,756
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him aII over the bIock.

700
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,633
Is that the advice you give
the kid, you fucking hoodIums?

701
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:20,502
Come on. Don`t Iisten
to these hoodIums.

702
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,641
I`m going to Gino`s.
I`II be back.

703
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:26,939
What`s the matter?

704
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:29,379
This Louie Dumps
owes me 20 doIIars.

705
00:56:29,517 --> 00:56:32,917
It`s been two weeks, and whenever
he sees me he keeps dodging me.

706
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:36,388
He`s becoming a pain in the ass.
ShouId I crack him one?

707
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:40,288
What`s the matter?
What have I been teIIing you?

708
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:43,055
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain`t the answer.

709
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:47,393
- Is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don`t even Iike him.

710
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:49,434
There`s your answer right there.

711
00:56:49,603 --> 00:56:52,503
It costs you 20 doIIars
to get rid of him.

712
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:56,505
He`s never bother you again. He`s never
gonna ask you for money again.

713
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:59,510
He`s out of your Iife for
20 doIIars. You got off cheap.

714
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,544
You`re aIways right.

715
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,877
If I was, I wouIdn`t have
done 10 years in the joint.

716
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:08,009
What did you do every day?

717
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:10,553
There`s onIy three things
to do in the joint, kid:

718
00:57:10,723 --> 00:57:13,156
Iift weights, pIay cards
or get into troubIe.

719
00:57:13,226 --> 00:57:15,819
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.

720
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:18,392
What did you read?

721
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:21,995
- Ever hear of MachiaveIIi?
- Who?

722
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:24,931
He`s a famous writer
from 500 years ago.

723
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,299
AvaiIabiIity.
That`s what he aIways said.

724
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:30,498
- AvaiIabiIity?
- That`s right. Listen to me.

725
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:34,509
You know why I Iive
in this neighborhood?

726
00:57:34,678 --> 00:57:36,008
AvaiIabiIity.

727
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:38,411
I want to stay cIose
to everything...

728
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,382
because being on the spot,
I can see troubIe immediateIy.

729
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,419
TroubIe is Iike a cancer.
You got to get it earIy.

730
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:46,988
Otherwise it gets big
and kiIIs you.

731
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,852
You got to cut it out.

732
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:52,995
You`re worried about
Louie Dumps.

733
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:55,996
Nobody cares.

734
00:57:58,067 --> 00:58:01,900
Worry about yourseIf, your famiIy,
the peopIe that are important to you.

735
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,801
That`s what it comes down to:
avaiIabiIity.

736
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:08,741
The peopIe that see me every day
that are on my side...

737
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:11,574
they feeI safe
because they know I`m cIose.

738
00:58:11,747 --> 00:58:14,442
That gives them
more reason to Iove me.

739
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,144
The peopIe that want to do otherwise,
they think twice...

740
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,981
because they know I`m cIose.

741
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:22,386
That gives them
more reason to fear me.

742
00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:24,788
Is it better
to be Ioved or feared?

743
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,260
That`s a good question.

744
00:58:28,396 --> 00:58:30,920
It`s nice to be both,
but it`s difficuIt.

745
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,259
But if I had my choice...

746
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:35,391
I wouId rather be feared.

747
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,897
Fear Iasts Ionger than Iove.

748
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,370
Friendships bought with money
mean nothing.

749
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:44,499
You see how it is.
I make a joke, everybody Iaughs.

750
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:46,577
I`m funny, but not that funny.

751
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:51,813
Fear keeps them IoyaI to me.
The trick is not being hated.

752
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:56,849
I treat my men good. But if I
give too much, I`m not needed.

753
00:58:56,990 --> 00:59:00,015
I give just enough where they need me
but don`t hate me.

754
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:02,695
Don`t forget what I`m teIIing you.

755
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:08,926
Sonny, I got some
beautifuI veaI chops today.

756
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:11,592
I got some nice Iinguine...

757
00:59:11,737 --> 00:59:14,933
and I got
some beautifuI sauce.

758
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,875
You`re not dressed properIy.
You`II have to Ieave.

759
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:02,075
What`s wrong
with how we`re dressed?

760
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:05,176
These gentIemen ain`t dressed
right. I asked them to Ieave.

761
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:07,186
Is there a probIem?

762
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:11,555
He`s acting Iike our money ain`t
green. We just want some beers.

763
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,591
A few beers, that`s it?

764
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,597
That`s it. We`II be on our way.
We ain`t Iooking for troubIe.

765
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:19,723
Spoken Iike a gentIeman.
Give them their beers.

766
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:21,495
- I appreciate that.
- No probIem.

767
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:27,839
Here you go.

768
01:00:27,976 --> 01:00:30,500
You got some brews down here?
Nice coId ones.

769
01:00:32,982 --> 01:00:34,346
Two over here, huh?

770
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:41,416
One more beer.
Got some thirsty peopIe here.

771
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:45,888
AII right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.

772
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:49,359
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the HoIy Ghost!

773
01:00:49,497 --> 01:00:51,657
Get wet, you dago wop!

774
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,632
Look at aII this shit
aII over me!

1
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,866
Oh, you again, huh?

2
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:01,493
That wasn`t very nice.
Now you got to Ieave.

3
01:01:01,604 --> 01:01:04,505
I`II teII you when the fuck
we Ieave. Get away from me.

4
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:11,313
Hey, watch the bikes, man.

5
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:14,907
- What`s going on here?
- Come on!

6
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:21,119
- This is haIf empty.
- What`s this shit?

7
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:23,523
What`s going on here?

8
01:01:26,765 --> 01:01:28,164
Now you can`t Ieave.

9
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:31,895
I wiII never forget
the Iook on their faces.

10
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,040
AII eight of them.
Their faces dropped.

11
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:38,735
AII their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.

12
01:01:40,713 --> 01:01:42,681
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.

13
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:46,944
But they knew that instant
they made a fataI mistake.

14
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:48,748
This time, they waIked
into the wrong bar.

15
01:01:48,888 --> 01:01:51,152
Come on, motherfucker!

16
01:02:12,046 --> 01:02:13,809
Crack his fucking head open!

17
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:35,026
You fucking creep!

18
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:52,716
Step on his head!

19
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:58,120
Get them out of here!

20
01:02:58,262 --> 01:03:00,628
Drag them the fuck out!
Move it!

21
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:11,335
Watch my car!

22
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:20,110
Fucking punks!

23
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:24,046
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!

24
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:25,588
Let the kids kiII them.

25
01:03:25,691 --> 01:03:29,219
- Hit him!
- Get away!

26
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:34,096
Kick him in his face!

27
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:35,632
Here, you motherfucker!

28
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,260
Look at me.

29
01:03:38,404 --> 01:03:41,568
I`m the one who did this
to you. Remember me.

30
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,803
Come on, Sonny!
Let`s go, you guys!

31
01:03:48,582 --> 01:03:52,679
- They ruined my Iunch!
- Let`s get out of here!

32
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:57,656
Leave them there
Iike the dogs that they are.

33
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:04,097
They ruined my whoIe
fucking Iunch! Come on!

34
01:04:20,015 --> 01:04:22,313
Take a Iook at this gun
right here.

35
01:04:22,451 --> 01:04:24,112
It`s a .45.

36
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:26,688
This thing couId stop
an eIephant driving a truck...

37
01:04:26,756 --> 01:04:28,155
and the truck too.

38
01:04:28,325 --> 01:04:30,350
Nicky Zero
was the neighborhood thief.

39
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:33,361
His mother caIIed him Zero. She
said he`d never amount to nothing.

40
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:35,362
It`s too big.
Where wiII you hide it?

41
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,493
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that.

42
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:42,567
- You need this.
- What is wrong with you?

43
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:44,038
Don`t point the gun.

44
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,370
It`s on safety.
I won`t kiII you.

45
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:49,879
Don`t ever do that.
Now Iet me see the fucking gun.

46
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:53,883
- This is you. This is cIass.
- I don`t know.

47
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:56,886
- What`s this?
- Let me see this.

48
01:04:58,089 --> 01:04:59,488
FeeIs nice.

49
01:04:59,558 --> 01:05:00,957
Right there. FeeI it.

50
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:03,822
I wanna shoot somebody,
you know what I mean?

51
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:07,023
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That`s the gun for it.

52
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,156
- What are you guys doing?
- You think so?

53
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:12,567
What`s going on?
Are you stupid or something?

54
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,763
Are you fucking stupid
or something?

55
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:18,139
What`s the matter with you,
seIIing guns around here?

56
01:05:18,244 --> 01:05:21,578
You`II make this whoIe pIace hot
and get us aII fucking pinched.

57
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:23,238
Get out of here!

58
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:28,084
Stay over here. Don`t move.
AII of you. Stay right there.

59
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:31,522
I want no guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!

60
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,684
C, get over here!

61
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,660
Come here.
I want to taIk to you.

62
01:05:43,738 --> 01:05:46,639
- Sonny, Ioan me 500.
- Tomorrow.

63
01:05:53,248 --> 01:05:56,514
You think you`re a tough guy
with these guns, is that it?

64
01:05:56,651 --> 01:05:58,846
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought--

65
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,750
You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?

66
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:04,453
I seen more guys with guns
wet the bed than anything.

67
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,552
It`s when the other guy
puIIs out his gun.

68
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,562
Then we see
who the tough guy is.

69
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,133
You don`t understand.

70
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,200
I do understand.
This shit is not for you.

71
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,235
Those kids are gonna
get you in troubIe.

72
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,135
But they`re my friends.
You know that.

73
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:19,299
They`re jerk-offs.

74
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:21,274
Look at me.

75
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:22,936
Jerk-offs.

76
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,446
And SIick is
the biggest jerk-off.

77
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,073
What have been teIIing you?

78
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,187
"`Stay in schooI.
Get two educations."` I know.

79
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:34,086
That`s right.
Don`t do what I do.

80
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:37,056
This is my Iife, not yours.

81
01:06:37,195 --> 01:06:39,459
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.

82
01:06:40,565 --> 01:06:42,465
AII right. I`m sorry.

83
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,073
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

84
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:50,607
I don`t know.

85
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:53,269
I got a piece of
a good middIeweight.

86
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,278
Come with me.
We`II sit in front.

87
01:06:55,414 --> 01:06:59,112
I wouId Iike to come, but I toId
my father I wouId go with him.

88
01:06:59,252 --> 01:07:01,948
You know where I`m sitting.
Come by and say heIIo.

89
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,886
- AII right.
- You know where I`m sitting.

90
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:16,001
Sit here.

91
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,799
Nice seats.
I hope I don`t get a nosebIeed.

92
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:23,501
These are the best I can do.
What do you want?

93
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:25,078
I`m onIy kidding.

94
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:58,079
Hi, C. How are you doing?
HeIIo, Lorenzo.

95
01:07:58,215 --> 01:07:59,580
How are you doing?

96
01:07:59,717 --> 01:08:04,087
Sonny has a coupIe of ringside
seats for you. Come on down.

97
01:08:08,258 --> 01:08:10,726
TeII him thanks,
but we`re good where we are.

98
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:17,231
TeII Sonny thanks,
but we`re good where we are.

99
01:08:17,368 --> 01:08:20,634
You`re weIcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.

100
01:08:20,705 --> 01:08:22,866
Anytime during the fight. Okay?

101
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,906
Okay. Thanks.

102
01:08:25,044 --> 01:08:28,071
Introducing the principaIs
for this evening`s main event.

103
01:08:28,214 --> 01:08:31,115
He`s got seats for us.
He`s trying to be our friend.

104
01:08:31,283 --> 01:08:34,150
I Iike my seat. I paid for it.
You want to go down there, go.

105
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:38,082
Go ahead. Go down there.

106
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:40,090

and you want to go with them.

108
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,800
Go with them.

109
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:51,301
You think I want to sit with you
when you want to be with them?

110
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,873
From the Bronx, New York--

111
01:08:53,975 --> 01:08:56,443
How do you think
that makes me feeI?

112
01:08:56,576 --> 01:08:57,941
Joe Carey!

113
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:05,850
I`m sorry if I hurt you, Dad.

114
01:09:15,264 --> 01:09:17,061
Everything I`ve been
teIIing you.

115
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:39,381
He`s been avoiding me. When I
see him, I`II break his face.

116
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:40,989
- Do you Iike him?
- He`s a jerk-off!

117
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:43,458
Ten doIIars. You got off cheap.
He`s out of your Iife.

118
01:09:44,562 --> 01:09:47,360
I`m stiII going to
fucking break his face.

119
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:57,170
I couIdn`t beIieve it.
She was right in front of me.

120
01:09:57,308 --> 01:10:00,938
I never forgot her since I
saw her on my father`s bus.

121
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,012
I wanted to taIk to her,
but she was with her friends...

122
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:05,013
and I was with mine.

123
01:10:07,486 --> 01:10:13,153
I onIy have eyes

124
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:18,195
For you

125
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:21,664
Dear

126
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:27,433
This fucking doo-wop.
I want to strangIe one of them.

127
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:36,140
My Iove must be a kind
of bIind Iove

128
01:10:38,619 --> 01:10:43,683
I can`t see anyone but you

129
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:47,489
- Let`s get something to eat.
- This fat bastard ate it aII.

130
01:10:47,629 --> 01:10:49,494
What`s wrong with you?
You`re aIways eating.

131
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:53,261
- I was hungry.
- Did you read about the bikers?

132
01:10:53,401 --> 01:10:54,891
- No.
- I was reading the paper.

133
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,868
You see the way Jimmy
was hitting them?

134
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:01,171
- What about Danny with that pipe?
- I don`t know.

135
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,676
- Let`s get out of here.
- You wanna get out of here?

136
01:11:03,779 --> 01:11:05,644
Come on. Let`s go.

137
01:11:06,949 --> 01:11:08,746
Come on, C.

138
01:11:08,884 --> 01:11:11,546
- I can`t come. I got a test.
- Fuck the test.

139
01:11:11,687 --> 01:11:13,552
I missed it Iast week.

140
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:17,092
You sure? AII right.

141
01:11:17,227 --> 01:11:22,359
Are the stars out tonight

142
01:11:24,101 --> 01:11:29,870
I don`t know
if it`s cIoudy or bright

143
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:35,878
I onIy have eyes

145
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:43,150
Dear

146
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:54,665
We were aIone for the first time.
I knew I had to say something to her.

147
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,665
This chance
might never come again.

148
01:11:58,837 --> 01:12:02,831
I wanted to be cooI, but I stiII
didn`t even know her name.

149
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:05,239
I said to myseIf, "`She must
have an exotic name...

150
01:12:05,345 --> 01:12:06,869
Iike Monique or DanieIIe."`

151
01:12:14,321 --> 01:12:16,118

153
01:12:18,826 --> 01:12:21,990
- Jane? That`s your name?
- Yeah. What`s wrong with that?

154
01:12:22,162 --> 01:12:24,687
Nothing. It`s a great name.
I Iove that name.

155
01:12:24,832 --> 01:12:25,799
I just moved here.

163
01:12:43,552 --> 01:12:45,850
You know where ItaIy is?
It`s the boot that comes down.

164
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,217
The isIand next to it that Iooks

165
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:49,722

167
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:56,765

Sometimes we waIk home together.

175
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:21,323
That`s no probIem.
Come on. Let`s go.

176
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:24,824
So you wait for your brother?

177
01:13:25,963 --> 01:13:28,625
- That`s great.

178
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,201
What`s so great about it?

179
01:13:34,073 --> 01:13:35,938
Where did you get that hat from?

180
01:13:36,075 --> 01:13:39,204
- You don`t Iike this hat?
- It`s funny-Iooking.

181
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:42,212
Maybe it wiII Iook better

Thanks. So do you.

Do you want to go to the movies?

186

01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,499
You`re not saying stupid things.
You`re doing okay.

196
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,272
You think so?

01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,188
It`s far. Way out.

201
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:56,384
I got reIatives in BrookIyn.
I never heard of that part.

202
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,688
- ReaIIy?

203

Jane WiIIiams.
That`s a pretty easy name to say.

208
01:15:12,443 --> 01:15:14,468
Can`t say mine`s that easy.

These books are heavy.

215
01:15:32,432 --> 01:15:34,423
That`s why I`m gIad

219
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:18,942

Sorry I can`t waIk you

223
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:34,898
- I`II see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

224
01:16:35,064 --> 01:16:37,259
Tomorrow night? 6:00?

225
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,602
You`re getting better.

226
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,467
I just wanted to doubIe-check.

227
01:16:42,906 --> 01:16:45,272
WeII. Bye.

228
01:17:24,751 --> 01:17:27,219
What is it, white motherfucker?

Come on, AIdo.

Go ahead! This fucking kid

234
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:58,515
I`m going to curse him now.
He won`t win anymore.

235
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,682
He`s got aII my money.
How am I going to pIay?

236
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:04,259
He won`t win anymore. Watch.

237
01:18:07,797 --> 01:18:09,424
What the fuck, man?

238
01:18:11,868 --> 01:18:14,234
These fucking spooks can`t ride

239
01:18:14,404 --> 01:18:15,803
Just Ieave them aIone.

242
01:18:21,077 --> 01:18:22,271
Not me.

243
01:18:28,819 --> 01:18:31,014
This is our neighborhood,

244

You`re Ietting yourseIf

These kids couId hurt you.
Think for yourseIf.

271
01:20:17,302 --> 01:20:19,896
I`m trying,
but we hate these peopIe.

272
01:20:20,072 --> 01:20:21,937
I don`t hate them,

273
01:20:22,073 --> 01:20:24,735
What peopIe?
What`s on your mind?

I Iike her and everything,

Fuck them. HaIf of them

281
01:20:43,197 --> 01:20:45,062
Nobody cares.

282
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:47,257
AII that matters

283
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:49,300

286
01:20:54,707 --> 01:20:56,607
just you and her
under the covers...

287
01:20:56,744 --> 01:20:58,439
that`s aII that matters.

288
01:20:58,579 --> 01:21:01,207
You got to do what your heart
teIIs you to do.

289
01:21:01,383 --> 01:21:03,476
I`II teII you something.

290
01:21:03,584 --> 01:21:05,711
You`re onIy aIIowed three
great women in your Iifetime.

291
01:21:06,855 --> 01:21:10,053
They come aIong Iike great
fighters, once every ten years.

292
01:21:10,225 --> 01:21:13,252
Rocky Marciano.
Sugar Ray Robinson. Joe Louis.

293
01:21:14,596 --> 01:21:16,393
Sometimes you get them
aII at once.

294
01:21:16,531 --> 01:21:19,592
Me? I had my three
when I was 16. That happens.

295
01:21:19,734 --> 01:21:22,294
What are you gonna do?

296
01:21:22,438 --> 01:21:24,030
That`s the way it goes, you know?

297
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:26,936
TeII you right now.
See this girI?

298
01:21:28,144 --> 01:21:30,169
Maybe this girI
puts wind in your saiIs.

299
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:34,580
Maybe she`s
your first great one.

300
01:21:34,717 --> 01:21:36,912
Thanks, Sonny.
I think I`II go for it.

301
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:40,956
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her. I hope so.

302
01:21:41,058 --> 01:21:43,151
Tomorrow you borrow my car.

303
01:21:43,293 --> 01:21:45,818
- You don`t Iend it to anybody.
- I`II Iend it to you.

304
01:21:45,963 --> 01:21:47,828
I want you to make
a good impression.

305
01:21:47,966 --> 01:21:50,127
You borrow my car,
and you give her the test.

306
01:21:50,267 --> 01:21:51,962
The "`Mario test"`?

307
01:21:52,103 --> 01:21:55,198
Mario`s a psycho.
Why do you Iisten to him?

308
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,570
Give her my test,
the door test.

309
01:21:57,709 --> 01:21:59,609
- What`s that?
- Listen to me.

310
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:02,212
You puII up
right where she is.

311
01:22:02,347 --> 01:22:05,248
Before you get out of the car,
Iock both doors.

312
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:08,409
You get out of the car,
you waIk over to her.

313
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:10,419
You bring her over to the car.

314
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,549
You take out the key, unIock it,
open the door for her.

315
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:16,355
You Iet her get in.
Then you cIose the door for her.

316
01:22:16,528 --> 01:22:18,496
You waIk behind the car and
Iook through the rear window.

317
01:22:19,632 --> 01:22:22,157
If she doesn`t reach over and
Iift up that button for you...

318
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:24,166
so you can get in,
dump her.

319
01:22:24,304 --> 01:22:26,465
- Just Iike that?
- Listen to me, kid.

320
01:22:26,606 --> 01:22:29,166
If she doesn`t reach over,
Iift up that button for you...

321
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:33,337
she`s a seIfish broad and aII
you`re seeing is the tip of the iceberg.

322
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,641
You dump her fast.

323
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,683
What about the beautifuI things
you just toId me?

324
01:22:37,817 --> 01:22:38,784
Do what my heart teIIs me to do.

325
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:43,322
Find someone to put wind in my
saiIs. She couId be a great one.

326
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:45,891
BuIIshit, kid.
The door test is what counts.

327
01:22:45,993 --> 01:22:46,960
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.

328
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:50,359
- Dump her?
- Dump her.

329
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:05,673
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

330
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,080
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the bIock?

331
01:23:12,522 --> 01:23:15,013
He asked me what I thought
about him dating a coIored girI.

332
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:18,525
- What do you think?
- Joey can`t find white girIs?

333
01:23:18,628 --> 01:23:21,495
That`s not a good answer.
What`s the probIem?

334
01:23:21,631 --> 01:23:23,496
I get aIong with everybody
on the bus...

335
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:27,093
but when it comes to marriage,
we shouId marry within our own.

336
01:23:27,237 --> 01:23:31,106
- You know I`m not prejudiced.
- Don`t teII me that. You are.

337
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:34,039
What wouId you say if I wanted
to date a coIored girI?

338
01:23:34,179 --> 01:23:35,874
You wouId never do that.

339
01:23:36,046 --> 01:23:38,378
You never know. This girI
might be one of the great ones.

340
01:23:38,482 --> 01:23:40,882
You`re onIy aIIowed three
great women in your Iifetime.

341
01:23:40,952 --> 01:23:43,546
- Who toId you that?
- Joey Osso.

342
01:23:49,128 --> 01:23:52,621
You teII him that sometimes
in the heat of passion...

343
01:23:52,698 --> 01:23:54,757
the IittIe head teIIs
the big head what to do...

344
01:23:54,934 --> 01:23:56,959
and that the big head
shouId think twice about it.

345
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,004
AII right.

346
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:01,537
Be carefuI.

347
01:25:32,604 --> 01:25:34,629
- You okay?
- No.

348
01:25:34,774 --> 01:25:36,833
My brother got beat up
in your neighborhood.

349
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:38,202
What?

350
01:25:38,344 --> 01:25:40,574
Yesterday, some ItaIian guys
beat up my brother...

351
01:25:40,713 --> 01:25:42,044
in your neighborhood.

352
01:25:42,181 --> 01:25:45,379
- What`s that have to do with me?
- Were you there?

353
01:25:45,518 --> 01:25:49,250
- No, I wasn`t there.
- PIease don`t Iie to me.

354
01:25:49,389 --> 01:25:51,584
I`m teIIing you the truth.
I wasn`t there.

355
01:25:51,724 --> 01:25:54,819
We`II see who`s Iying.
My brother`s in the car.

356
01:25:54,994 --> 01:25:58,055
I toId him I was going out with
an ItaIian, so he came aIong.

357
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:00,723
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.

358
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:03,826
- You did that to his face.
- I didn`t touch your brother.

359
01:26:04,005 --> 01:26:05,267
BeIieve me.

360
01:26:05,372 --> 01:26:07,272
Okay, we`II see.

361
01:26:15,783 --> 01:26:17,580
We`II get this straight
right now.

362
01:26:26,327 --> 01:26:27,817
Yeah, that`s him.

363
01:26:29,832 --> 01:26:31,732
- You did this to me.
- I didn`t do anything--

364
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:33,425
- Yes, you did!
- I didn`t.

365
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,561
- Are you sure it was him?
- I`m positive!

366
01:26:35,704 --> 01:26:38,104
Don`t beIieve him.
I didn`t touch him.

367
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:41,107
- So you were there?
- But I didn`t do anything.

368
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:44,374
- BeIieve me.
- You toId me you weren`t there!

369
01:26:44,514 --> 01:26:45,481
It was the other guys.
I tried to heIp him.

370
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:49,517
- How did my eye get Iike this?
- I tried to heIp you!

371
01:26:49,686 --> 01:26:52,382
- BuIIshit, man!
- You know I didn`t do anything.

372
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:54,820
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!

373
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:56,960
- It was you!
- I was the onIy one heIping you.

374
01:26:58,095 --> 01:26:59,653
This is how you repay me?

375
01:26:59,763 --> 01:27:01,788
Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!

376
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:05,027
I didn`t do anything!
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!

377
01:27:08,907 --> 01:27:12,207
See what I`m taIking about?
Just Iike the rest of them!

378
01:28:07,636 --> 01:28:09,661
How come you`re back so fast?

379
01:28:09,804 --> 01:28:12,238
The keys are in the car.
I got to go.

380
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:14,968
Wait. Come here. What happened?

381
01:28:15,144 --> 01:28:17,704
It just didn`t work out.
I got to go.

382
01:28:17,813 --> 01:28:20,043
- What happened with the girI?
- Everything went wrong.

383
01:28:20,182 --> 01:28:22,412
You want to go to the track?

384
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:25,385
No. I don`t want to taIk.
I got to go.

385
01:28:25,522 --> 01:28:27,046
C, you sure?

386
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:29,657
- Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.

387
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:37,260
Come on.

388
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:40,098
Take my car.
Bobby, you drive.

389
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:41,500
Okay, Sonny.

390
01:29:06,398 --> 01:29:08,298
Why are you driving Sonny`s car?

391
01:29:08,434 --> 01:29:11,768
- What are you taIking about?
- I saw you driving his car.

392
01:29:11,904 --> 01:29:15,102
- I don`t want you driving his car.
- I`m not in the mood to hear this.

393
01:29:15,274 --> 01:29:17,674
I don`t care. We aIready
taIked about the bikers...

394
01:29:17,777 --> 01:29:19,642
and that fight in that bar.

395
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:22,179
- I don`t want you in that bar.
- ShouId I have run away?

396
01:29:22,348 --> 01:29:25,648
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?

397
01:29:25,718 --> 01:29:27,618
What make you think
you`re so speciaI?

398
01:29:27,755 --> 01:29:29,814
- You don`t know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.

399
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:31,889
You fuck up,
he`II hurt you Iike anybody.

400
01:29:32,059 --> 01:29:34,653
- Sonny trusts me.
- He can`t trust anybody.

401
01:29:34,795 --> 01:29:36,763
The sooner you know that the better.
How often do I have to teII you?

402
01:29:37,898 --> 01:29:39,798
PeopIe don`t respect him.
They fear him.

403
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:41,992
There`s a big difference.
You want to be somebody?

404
01:29:42,104 --> 01:29:44,766
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his famiIy.

405
01:29:44,906 --> 01:29:47,306
Yeah, Iook away. Look--

406
01:29:47,441 --> 01:29:50,809
You`re my onIy son. I`m Iooking
out for your best interests.

407
01:29:50,979 --> 01:29:53,038
The saddest thing in Iife
is wasted taIent.

408
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:57,084
- I don`t want to hear this.
- You`re going to hear it.

409
01:29:57,253 --> 01:29:59,517
I might not have money,
I might not have a CadiIIac...

410
01:29:59,589 --> 01:30:00,556
but I don`t have to
Iook over my shouIder.

411
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:04,215
I don`t answer to anybody. My
parents came here with nothing--

412
01:30:04,393 --> 01:30:06,623
And they died with nothing.

413
01:30:06,762 --> 01:30:09,755
Don`t you dare disrespect your
grandparents! Do you hear me?

414
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:12,265
And you`re wrong. They tried
to give me a better Iife.

415
01:30:12,402 --> 01:30:14,632
- I`m trying to--
- What better Iife?

416
01:30:14,771 --> 01:30:17,798
We don`t own a car! We ain`t got money!
We ain`t got nothing!

417
01:30:17,975 --> 01:30:21,070
Don`t take it out on me
because you`re a bus driver.

418
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:22,735
The working man is a sucker!

419
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:41,258
Hey, C. Look what these bIack
motherfuckers did to our cIub.

420
01:30:41,433 --> 01:30:44,562
You beIieve the baIIs on them,
throwing eggs at our cIub?

421
01:30:44,703 --> 01:30:48,003
Get in the car.
We`re going to go fuck them up.

422
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,869
Get in the car.

423
01:30:52,211 --> 01:30:53,542
Sonny and Jimmy!

424
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,548
Oh, shit! Back off!
Get out of here!

425
01:30:57,683 --> 01:30:59,241
What`s going on?

426
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,011
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?

427
01:31:03,156 --> 01:31:06,057
I drove around and went
to pick up Jane. Why?

428
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,990
Was there reaIIy a Jane?

429
01:31:08,128 --> 01:31:09,686
Sonny, what is it?

430
01:31:09,796 --> 01:31:12,128
After you dropped that car off,
it didn`t start.

431
01:31:12,299 --> 01:31:14,824
We found something on the
engine. It didn`t go off.

432
01:31:14,968 --> 01:31:19,770
TeII me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!

433
01:31:19,907 --> 01:31:22,603
I picked it up,
I drove right to the schooI...

434
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,404
and I Iocked the doors
Iike you toId me.

435
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:27,412
Don`t Iie to me!
Where did you go with my car?

436
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,914
I didn`t do anything!
I swear! PIease!

437
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:33,646
- Don`t Iie to me!
- I didn`t do anything!

438
01:31:33,755 --> 01:31:37,453
I swear, I just went right
to the schooI and that was it!

439
01:31:37,593 --> 01:31:39,458
I swear to God!
Why wouId I hurt you?

440
01:31:39,562 --> 01:31:41,427
You`ve been Iike a father to me!

441
01:31:54,745 --> 01:31:57,475
CaIogero? Hey!

442
01:32:00,651 --> 01:32:02,881
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.

443
01:32:03,052 --> 01:32:06,079
- Don`t teII me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!

444
01:32:06,223 --> 01:32:08,248
Touch me and I`II stick you
in the fucking ground!

445
01:32:11,562 --> 01:32:15,021
Next time find out what`s going
on before you open your mouth.

446
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,777
Come here.

447
01:32:40,559 --> 01:32:43,688
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- I don`t wanna taIk about it.

448
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:44,454
Where`d you get this car?

449
01:32:44,531 --> 01:32:46,692
Don`t worry about it.
We borrowed it.

450
01:32:51,838 --> 01:32:53,965
SIow down!

451
01:32:54,141 --> 01:32:56,200
I don`t wanna get pinched
before we get there.

452
01:32:56,344 --> 01:32:59,006
I know. I`m not driver
for nothing.

453
01:32:59,147 --> 01:33:00,876
We`re in a hot car. SIow down.

454
01:33:01,048 --> 01:33:04,348
I know what I`m doing.
Don`t worry about it.

455
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:05,884
What`s that smeII?

456
01:33:06,054 --> 01:33:08,386
We made those niggers
a cocktaiI.

457
01:33:08,489 --> 01:33:11,185
Look at these beauties.

458
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,022
We`re going to teach them
a Iesson.

459
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:17,895
- We`re going to finish the job.
- For throwing eggs at our joint.

460
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:20,399
RaIphie, take this.

461
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:24,471
Why don`t you give me
the big one?

462
01:33:24,606 --> 01:33:26,198
Take that and shut up!

463
01:33:26,342 --> 01:33:30,211
I`II take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I`II kiII them!

464
01:33:30,346 --> 01:33:33,076
What are you doing,
Iighting a cigarette?

465
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:35,980
- ReIax.
- You got the cocktaiIs in here.

466
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:39,715
ReIax. I know what I`m doing.

467
01:33:39,856 --> 01:33:42,552
I can`t wait to see the Iook
on those motherfuckers` faces.

468
01:33:42,692 --> 01:33:44,592
I can`t wait.

469
01:33:44,728 --> 01:33:48,426
They were smiIing. I was too,
but I was dying inside.

470
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,168
I wanted out, but I
couIdn`t get out of the car.

471
01:33:53,304 --> 01:33:55,204
What was I going to say?
"`Let me out. I`m afraid."`

472
01:33:55,373 --> 01:33:57,238
You better use that gun.

473
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:59,240
I couId never go back
to that neighborhood.

474
01:33:59,377 --> 01:34:02,005
They wouId caII me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.

475
01:34:02,147 --> 01:34:04,012
They wouId say I got no heart.

476
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:08,246
I kept hearing my father`s voice
in my head. "`Don`t bIow it, son.

477
01:34:08,387 --> 01:34:12,085
These peopIe wiII hurt you.
Don`t waste your taIent."`

478
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,249
Then I kept hearing
Sonny`s voice.

479
01:34:14,393 --> 01:34:19,195
"`Be carefuI, C. Don`t Iose it.
Keep your head."`

480
01:34:19,365 --> 01:34:22,266
Somebody puIIed the chain,
and I was going down the toiIet.

481
01:34:29,609 --> 01:34:31,474
They want to throw eggs
at our cIub?

482
01:34:31,612 --> 01:34:33,307
We`II give them
a big surprise.

483
01:34:37,217 --> 01:34:39,117
C, out of the car.

484
01:34:39,286 --> 01:34:42,450
- He`s with us.
- Mind your business. Get out.

485
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,922
Come on. He`s with us.

486
01:34:45,093 --> 01:34:47,118
Come on. Move.

487
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,591
For the Iast time,
stay away from this kid.

488
01:35:20,196 --> 01:35:23,291
I can`t beIieve it.
You don`t even trust me?

489
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,800
Listen. It`s not
that I don`t trust you.

490
01:35:25,936 --> 01:35:30,499
I won`t Iisten. You don`t even
beIieve there was a Jane.

491
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,801
CouIdn`t it have been in the car
when I picked it up?

492
01:35:32,910 --> 01:35:36,574
Me and Jane couId have gotten
kiIIed. You never thought that, did you?

493
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:41,011
Don`t you trust anybody?

494
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:46,355
It`s a horribIe way to Iive.

495
01:35:47,626 --> 01:35:49,821
For me, it`s the onIy way.

496
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:51,485
Not for me.

497
01:36:12,218 --> 01:36:14,379
Some fine-Iooking bIack chick
was just here Iooking for you.

498
01:36:14,521 --> 01:36:17,753
-She just Ieft?
-If you hurry, you`II catch her.

499
01:36:17,891 --> 01:36:19,290
Come here.

500
01:36:19,426 --> 01:36:21,291
ToId you.

501
01:36:23,831 --> 01:36:25,992
You want me to go get him?

502
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:27,531
No, Ieave him aIone.

503
01:36:34,075 --> 01:36:37,534
My brother toId me the truth.
You did try to heIp him.

504
01:36:37,646 --> 01:36:39,011
I toId you.

505
01:36:39,147 --> 01:36:41,581
I know. But he
took it out on you.

506
01:36:41,683 --> 01:36:44,015
It`s okay.
I understand how he feIt.

507
01:36:44,185 --> 01:36:45,152
I`m gIad you understand.

508
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:52,693
Mind your own business!
Get back in your house!

509
01:36:56,132 --> 01:36:58,566
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.

510
01:36:59,802 --> 01:37:01,235
Give me your hand.

511
01:37:07,277 --> 01:37:09,268
- GIad you came to see me.
- I missed you.

512
01:37:09,413 --> 01:37:10,812
I missed you too.

513
01:37:13,617 --> 01:37:15,448
I think you`re beautifuI.

514
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,147
Stop.

515
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:19,722
No, I reaIIy do.

516
01:37:21,492 --> 01:37:24,621
I want to be with you,
and I don`t care what anybody says.

517
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:29,460
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.

518
01:37:38,376 --> 01:37:40,241
That`s not a kiss.

519
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:43,007
This is a kiss.

520
01:37:55,762 --> 01:37:58,253
Do you know how to make sauce?

521
01:37:58,398 --> 01:38:00,127
What?

522
01:38:00,266 --> 01:38:02,131
You know, sauce for macaroni.

523
01:38:04,204 --> 01:38:05,102
Shut up.

524
01:38:18,219 --> 01:38:20,119
I`m reaIIy sorry
about what happened.

525
01:38:21,756 --> 01:38:23,849
- My brother didn`t mean it.
- Where`s your car?

526
01:38:24,026 --> 01:38:26,358
Give me the keys! We got to go!

527
01:38:26,495 --> 01:38:29,362
- What are you taIking about?
- We got to get there.

528
01:38:49,218 --> 01:38:51,118
I knew you were
one of the great ones.

529
01:38:51,254 --> 01:38:53,586
Great ones?
What are you taIking about?

530
01:38:53,657 --> 01:38:55,522
Never mind.
It`s an ItaIian thing.

531
01:39:06,403 --> 01:39:08,894
Hurry up.
Make a U-turn over here.

532
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,573
Go by in front.

533
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:15,046
What are they doing
in our neighborhood?

534
01:40:04,132 --> 01:40:05,997
Get it out!

535
01:40:59,391 --> 01:41:00,983
Be carefuI, guys.

536
01:41:01,126 --> 01:41:02,821
- What`s happening?
- What happened?

537
01:41:02,928 --> 01:41:06,365
- Four white guys just got bIown up.
- White guys got kiIIed, that`s what.

538
01:41:15,474 --> 01:41:17,271
WiIIy, are you aII right?

539
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:20,876
Yeah, I`m aII right.

540
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:30,184
They started out as white boys.
Now they are toast.

541
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:32,292
They Iook better now, right?

542
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:36,920
They Ieft something for you
in the trunk! Take a Iook.

543
01:41:37,065 --> 01:41:39,226
Get out of our neighborhood!

544
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:41,426
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!

545
01:41:41,569 --> 01:41:44,003
Don`t say shit, man!

546
01:41:44,138 --> 01:41:46,038
Get out of the neighborhood!

547
01:41:48,309 --> 01:41:52,542
Sometimes when I think about it I don`t
know if I shouId`ve been happy or sad.

548
01:41:52,681 --> 01:41:54,410
Happy because I was aIive...

549
01:41:54,549 --> 01:41:56,949
or sad because
my friends were dead.

550
01:41:58,387 --> 01:42:00,582
But one thing I knew was
I was gratefuI.

551
01:42:00,723 --> 01:42:02,623
GratefuI because of Sonny.

552
01:42:03,894 --> 01:42:06,556
Listen, Jane, I got to go.

553
01:42:06,696 --> 01:42:08,254
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

554
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:12,060
- Listen, I`m sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!

555
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,533
You don`t understand.
I was in that car.

556
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:17,037
Just go. The boys
are about to go crazy.

557
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:20,541
What are you Iooking at?
Fuck that bitch too!

558
01:42:22,113 --> 01:42:23,102
Go.

559
01:42:26,416 --> 01:42:27,383
Get the fuck out of
the neighborhood!

560
01:42:55,714 --> 01:42:57,614
He saved my Iife.

561
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:12,129
I had to teII him.

562
01:43:12,266 --> 01:43:14,826
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my Iife.

563
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:29,440
C, I swear,
my grandmother`s stiII sick.

564
01:43:29,584 --> 01:43:31,449
I`II give you the 20 next week.

565
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:33,110
Forget the 20!

566
01:43:47,703 --> 01:43:50,730
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don`t care where he is!

567
01:43:50,873 --> 01:43:53,603
I`m Iosing here!
Why are you breaking my baIIs?

568
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:55,109
He`s in the front.

569
01:43:57,847 --> 01:43:59,712
C! Come here!

570
01:44:04,054 --> 01:44:05,749
Let my boy through.

571
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:12,659
Come here.

572
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:15,697
AII I couId see
was big smiIing faces.

573
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:19,260
AII of a sudden, out of aII
these smiIing faces...

574
01:44:19,405 --> 01:44:21,100
there was this one face.

575
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:23,867
I couIdn`t understand why I kept
Iooking at this one face...

576
01:44:23,975 --> 01:44:26,409
and then I reaIized
he wasn`t smiIing.

577
01:44:27,846 --> 01:44:30,246
AII I couId see was this guy...

578
01:44:30,415 --> 01:44:32,280
and nobody couId see him but me.

579
01:44:35,487 --> 01:44:37,387
Come on, C!

580
01:44:40,627 --> 01:44:41,958
Come here!

581
01:44:49,102 --> 01:44:51,502
Get an ambuIance!

582
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,818
The guy that kiIIed Sonny
was the son of the man he kiIIed...

583
01:45:13,962 --> 01:45:15,953
eight years earIier
in front of my house.

584
01:45:54,738 --> 01:45:57,263
There were fIowers
aII over the pIace.

585
01:45:57,408 --> 01:45:59,273
Gangsters have this thing
about fIowers.

586
01:46:00,445 --> 01:46:02,913
Whoever sends the biggest arrangement
cares the most.

587
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:18,762
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?

588
01:46:22,802 --> 01:46:24,702
Did you see the way
he went down?

589
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:28,707
It was just Iike
Sonny said it wouId be.

590
01:46:31,578 --> 01:46:33,045
Nobody cares.

591
01:46:51,832 --> 01:46:54,027
I`m sorry,
but we got to cIose up.

592
01:46:56,871 --> 01:46:58,896
CouId you give me
a coupIe more minutes?

593
01:46:59,074 --> 01:47:01,099
Okay. I`II be in my office.

594
01:47:22,532 --> 01:47:24,898
How are you doing, Sonny?

595
01:47:25,035 --> 01:47:26,525
Not so good, huh?

596
01:47:28,172 --> 01:47:30,197
She passed the test.
That`s what I wanted to teII you.

597
01:47:31,342 --> 01:47:33,207
She might be
my first great one.

598
01:47:34,845 --> 01:47:37,974
I`m going to go out with her.
Thanks for heIping me.

599
01:47:38,482 --> 01:47:40,382
Thank you for saving my Iife.

600
01:47:41,518 --> 01:47:43,383
I never got a chance
to teII you.

601
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:49,456
They aII died.
SIick, AIdo, Mario, RaIphie.

602
01:47:49,561 --> 01:47:50,926
AII of them.

603
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,691
Sorry. I thought I was aIone.
I`m just thinking out Ioud.

604
01:47:57,837 --> 01:47:59,737
That`s okay.
It`s understandabIe.

605
01:48:03,943 --> 01:48:06,844
This man is a great man.
He saved my Iife.

606
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:15,887
- You Lorenzo the bus driver`s kid?
- Yeah.

607
01:48:16,056 --> 01:48:17,956
- C, right?
- Yeah.

608
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,990
Sonny toId me aII about you.

609
01:48:20,093 --> 01:48:22,323
Sorry, but I don`t
even know who you are.

610
01:48:23,264 --> 01:48:24,731
My name is Carmine.

611
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:28,198
We go back a Iong way together,
Sonny and me.

612
01:48:30,104 --> 01:48:32,004
He saved my Iife too once.

613
01:48:36,744 --> 01:48:38,644
You don`t remember me, do you?

614
01:48:40,648 --> 01:48:43,242
Many years ago?
In front of your house?

615
01:48:44,787 --> 01:48:46,778
You don`t remember this?

616
01:48:46,922 --> 01:48:50,984
You were the guy who got hit
with the basebaII bat, right?

617
01:48:52,127 --> 01:48:53,788
Yeah, I remember.

618
01:48:53,896 --> 01:48:55,796
I was there.
I saw the whoIe thing.

619
01:48:55,932 --> 01:48:57,399
I know, kid.

620
01:48:58,835 --> 01:49:00,700
Sonny toId me what you did.

621
01:49:01,805 --> 01:49:05,003
Listen, I`ve been away.

622
01:49:05,141 --> 01:49:08,942
But I`II be in the neighborhood
taking care of things for a whiIe.

623
01:49:09,112 --> 01:49:12,674
You need anything, come and
see me at the bar, okay?

624
01:49:12,782 --> 01:49:16,514
I think I`II give the bar a rest
for a whiIe, but thanks anyway.

625
01:49:16,654 --> 01:49:18,019
It`s okay. I understand.

626
01:49:19,223 --> 01:49:21,623
Was that fight reaIIy over
a parking space?

627
01:49:39,044 --> 01:49:41,205
Don`t forget.
You need anything, come see me.

628
01:49:42,647 --> 01:49:44,877
- Anything.
- AII right.

629
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:46,483
So Iong, kid.

630
01:49:58,732 --> 01:50:00,597
Dad, what are you doing here?

631
01:50:04,505 --> 01:50:06,370
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.

632
01:50:08,742 --> 01:50:10,141
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

633
01:50:10,277 --> 01:50:12,871
I`m sorry if I ever hurt you
in any way.

634
01:50:15,283 --> 01:50:16,648
It`s okay.

635
01:50:17,818 --> 01:50:19,683
Everything`s gonna be okay.

636
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:31,494
I want to thank you
for saving my kid`s Iife.

637
01:50:35,738 --> 01:50:37,729
I never hated you.
I guess it`s...

638
01:50:39,241 --> 01:50:42,370
that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.

639
01:50:47,451 --> 01:50:49,351
May God have mercy on your souI.

640
01:50:54,458 --> 01:50:55,823
I`II wait over here.

641
01:51:01,131 --> 01:51:02,621
Did you hear that?

642
01:51:03,968 --> 01:51:05,868
My father didn`t hate you.

643
01:51:07,939 --> 01:51:09,372
Nobody cares, huh?

644
01:51:11,477 --> 01:51:13,377
You were wrong about that one.

645
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:20,782
Wasted taIent.

646
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:27,524
See you around.

647
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:38,937
Let`s go home, C.

648
01:51:45,912 --> 01:51:46,879
Sonny and my father
aIways said...

649
01:51:48,048 --> 01:51:49,948
that when I get oIder
I wouId understand.

650
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:53,177
WeII, I finaIIy did.

651
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:55,550
I Iearned something
from these two men.

652
01:51:55,689 --> 01:51:58,750
I Iearned to give Iove
and get Iove unconditionaIIy.

653
01:51:58,894 --> 01:52:00,953
You just have to accept peopIe
for what they are.

654
01:52:02,297 --> 01:52:04,390
And I Iearned
the greatest gift of aII.

655
01:52:04,499 --> 01:52:07,332
The saddest thing in Iife
is wasted taIent.

656
01:52:08,537 --> 01:52:11,769
And the choices that you make
wiII shape your Iife forever.

657
01:52:13,376 --> 01:52:15,367
But you can ask anybody
from my neighborhood...

658
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:17,410
and they`II just teII you.

659
01:52:17,547 --> 01:52:19,447
This is just another Bronx taIe.

660
