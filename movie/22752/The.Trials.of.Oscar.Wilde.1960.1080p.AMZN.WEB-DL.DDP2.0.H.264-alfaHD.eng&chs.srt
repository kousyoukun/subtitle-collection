00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,750
but as a poet like yourself might say, "What's in a name?"
但正如您自己的诗句中所说“什么是名头？”

I used to do odd jobs for His Lordship.
我曾经给爵士做一些特别的工作

279
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,130
there are parts that could be "misconstrued," I think is the word, sir.
有些部分，在语句上会引起“误会”，先生

280
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,530
How did you come by this?

Ah, yes, well, I used to...

As well you may know.

伍德先生，你是想让我赎回我自己的作品吗？

Well, sir, I... Come, sir, that's not very sound economics.
那么，先生，我。。。说吧，这也没什么不好意思的。

Then I suggest that you sell it at once.

for a prose work of that length.

You take the letter, sir.

我真愚蠢，和您讨价还价。

The thing is, sir, that I'm desperate for money and...
可事实上，我已经在经济上很拮据了

295
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,220
A hungry man gets driven to do stupid things.

Oh, would you like a ham sandwich?

On the contrary, Mr. Wood.

不不不，请再呆一会，喝完酒再走。

That's very kind of you.

303
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,150
You're a very poor criminal, Mr. Wood, if I may say so.
伍德先生，你是个可怜的罪犯，我能这么说吧。

304

The fact is I came to London to look for some work.
实际上，我是到伦敦找工作的。

Shall I serve dinner, madam?

he would be in for dinner.

It usually heralds an unpleasant scene.

WAITER: Good morning, My Lord.

Do you mean he blackmailed you?
你是说他敲诈你了？

把那封信放到任何人可以得到它的地方，这不仅仅是你的粗心大意，

Ah, when I was young I thought money was everything.

你知道，自从你我在一起，我花了多少钱吗？

Bosie, you seem to think that you have a right to live at my expense
波西，你有权靠我的花费过着

It isn't worthy of you, Oscar.

or what they are saying?

I adore scandal about other people,

Robbie, are you being solicitous about my welfare?

That is very impertinent of you.

I don't mean to be.

is done purely for effect. You've an artist.

The public expects you to be different.

你已经不是一个从牛津来的，苦兮兮的年轻诗人。

-Relax.  -You're a highly successful playwrighter

at the peak of your career.

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,570
Ah.
啊

431
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,100
You're walking along a precipice, Oscar.
你现在正走在悬崖边上，奥斯卡。

432

Just as long as you continue to play court jester,

433
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,060
society will accept you.

But tax their tolerance too far

435
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,630
and they'll send you crashing from the heights
那他们将把你从高处彻底击碎

436
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,670
-to the depths of obscurity.  -Oh, really.
-把我打回默默无闻的深渊。  -哦，真的。

437
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,500
A halo doesn't have to fall very far, Oscar, to become a noose.
光环不久就会变成套索落下，奥斯卡。

438
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,370
Really, Robbie, this all very tedious.
真的，罗比，这也太无聊了。

439
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,510
Just tell me one thing.
你只要告诉我一件事。

440
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,730
These stories I hear about you.

441
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,510
There isn't any truth in them, is there?

442
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,900
As I don't know what the stories are,

443

I'm hardly in a position to answer you.
我不知该如何回答你。

444
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,080
They say that you...
他们说你。。。

445

446
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,530
That you consort with criminals, stable boys.
你和罪犯打交道，那个马夫。

447
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,230
This sounds all very exciting and intriguing.

448
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,660
Do go on.

I just want to hear you tell me it isn't true.

Robbie,

I'm deeply hurt that you use our friendship to pry into my private life.
你有我们的友谊来刺探我个人的生活，对此我感到很受伤。

452
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,200
I thought you were a gentleman. I now see that you are not.
我过去认为你是一个绅士，现在我不这么认为。

453
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,990
I just want to hear you deny it, Oscar.
我只想听你否认它，奥斯卡。

You must think what you will, Robbie.

Mr. Wood to see you, sir.

I'd like some champagne tonight.

All right?

They didn't deliver any this week.

For heaven's sake, why not?
天呐，为什么？

473
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,590
Perhaps the fact that we owe the wine merchant 85 pounds
事实上，我们已经欠了酒商85英镑。

474
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,850
might have something to do with it.
这件事该认真对待了。

We've living on credit, Oscar, and that can't go on much longer.
我在靠信用过活，奥斯卡，再也不能这样下去了。

Well, if I can finish this play, everything will be all right.
等我这部戏写完，一切都会解决的。

477
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,340

If you please, sir.

好吧，昆斯博里侯爵，可以，阿瑟，你们走吧。

It seems the peerage don't have a monopoly of good manners.
看来，礼貌也并不是贵族的专利。

486
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,230
To hell with good manners, sir.
让礼貌见鬼去吧，先生

487
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,930
What I have to say to you has very little to do with good manners.
我不得不跟你说的，与礼貌毫无关系。

in the smallest sense of humanity, Lord Queensberry.
最起码的人性，昆斯博里侯爵。

Personally, I've sooner have 50 unnatural vices

than one unnatural virtue.
而不是一个天生的美德。

Yes, I can well believe that. Now, you listen to me, sir.
是的，我非常相信这点。现在，你给我听好了，先生。

I presume you have come to make a speech.
我猜你是来做一个演讲的。

499
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,920
If so, I hope it's a short one because I have work to do.

501
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,790

your disgusting relationship with my son.

to every cab driver and messenger boy in London.
伦敦任何一个马车夫或送信童都有同感。

509
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,610
Lord Queensberry, are you seriously suggesting that
昆斯博里侯爵，你难道不是认真地暗示

510
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,830
there is improper conduct between your son and myself?

我将拿鞭子抽你，直到把你抽倒在地上。

you choose to ignore the Queensberry rules.

-是的，我给你公平的警告。  -我也要给你公平的警告。

519
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,730
If you've not out of my house in two minutes, I shall throw you out.
如果你两分钟内不离开我的房间，我将把你扔出去。

520
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,250
I refuse to leave until I've had my say.
我不说完我不会离开的。

521
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,250
On the contrary, sir, you are leaving now.

522

Hit him! Hit him!

Arthur, open the door! This gentleman is leaving.

Gladly, sir.

This, Arthur, is the Marquis of Queensberry.
这位，阿瑟，是昆斯博里第八代侯爵。

这个伦敦最臭名昭着的畜生，你不能让他再进我的家门。

-Is that clear?   -Perfectly, sir.

Now get out.

But you'll regret this, I promise you.

I hope so, Arthur.

Now, this has got to stop.

You are the only one who can stop it, Oscar.
你是唯一能阻止这些事情的人，奥斯卡。

537
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,960
My God, am I not allowed to get on with my work in peace?
上帝啊，我到底能不能安静地工作?

538
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,610
What with creditors knocking at the door

539
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,530
and Bosie dropping in as if this was some sort of club.
如果是波西或者俱乐部其他人拜访怎么办。

而现在是那些粗鄙的恶棍和他所雇佣的打手。

I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite intolerable.
我能抵抗畜生的力量，但是畜生的理智却让人不能忍受。

542
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,800
It's like hitting below the intellect.
就像打击弱智的人。

543
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,410
Oscar, I beg of you to give up this friendship with Bosie.
奥斯卡，我希望你放弃和波西的友谊。

Not for me, but for your own sake.

He takes up too much of your time,

The truth is the boy has a strange fascination for me

that I can't get free of.

550
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,570
He needs you more than you need him.

551
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,570
He needs you because he is weak and conceited.
它需要你，因为他的脆弱和自负。

552
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,140
And you give him a stature he could never acquire alone.
而你给了他一个人永远达不到的声望。

553
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,880
And he will go on taking and taking until there's nothing left.

He'll destroy you, Oscar.

555
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,280
When I married you,
当我嫁给你时，

I still love you, darling.

To me you are higher and greater than any man in the world.

Help me, Constance.

560
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,420
Help me.
救我。

561
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,650
Why not go away for a little while?

562
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,430
At least until you have finished your play.
至少等到你写完你的剧本。

563
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,830
Maybe it will give you a chance to think more clearly.
也许，它会给你一个机会去想清楚这些。

564
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,740
Yes, I may.

565
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,440
You always liked the sea. Why not go down to Brighton?
你一直喜欢大海，为什么不去一趟布莱顿（英格兰西部港口）呢？

566
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,180
It should be very quiet at this time of year.
它将是这年中非常平静的时候。

567
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,010
It's a wonderful idea, Constance,
好主意，康斯坦斯，

568
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,190
but we've hardly enough money to pay the tradesmen, let alone hotel bills.
但是我们几乎没有足够钱来支付那些商人，更不用说旅馆账单。

569
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,190
I haven't touched my father's allowance for some months.
我已经有几个月没有动用过我父亲给我的津贴。

570

-It isn't very much, I'm afraid.   -No, no, Constance.

574
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,190
Goodness Lordy, Mr. Wilde, wherever have you been?
上帝啊，王尔德先生，你去哪里了？

575
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,490
I've been conversing with the elements, Mrs. Burgess.
我去和大自然谈了会儿话，伯杰斯夫人。

576
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,320
Oh, goodness me, you've soaked to the skin.
哦，天呐，您都湿透了。

577
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,930
Listening to the wisdom of the sea, Mrs. B.

578
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,760
Out all night in weather like this.
  这个天气，你居然在外头呆了一晚上

579

Now, you come upstairs and we'll get those wet clothes off
现在赶紧上楼，把湿衣服换下来

-在你将冻死之前。   -它都装在这里了。

Every word and every epigram, Mrs. Burgess.
每一个单词和每一个警句，伯杰斯夫人。

Oh, I'm very glad, Mr. Wilde, but do come on.
哦，我很高兴，王尔德先生，但要快点脱。

583
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,810
Every move and every curtain.

584

It's all here.

585
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,160
And the important thing is who is Ernest.

(此时王尔德正在构思剧本《不可儿戏》，欧内斯特是剧中人物）

586
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,290
Oh, yes, that will be nice.

Ernest and his little aunt...

But upstairs now, like a good boy, please, Mr. Wilde.
快上楼，像个乖孩子，王尔德先生。

You've very kind, Mrs. Burgess.
您太善良了，伯杰斯夫人。

Well, if we can't show a little kindness on this earth,
在这个世界上，如果我们再不表现出一点善良，

591
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,880
we might as well not be here, that's the way I see it.
那还是别在这里生存下去了，这是就我明白的地方。

00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,840
Now, you keep nice and warm.
现在，你暖暖和和地睡个好觉。

你能肯定是这个地方吗？老伙计。

Good morning, madam.

It's just at the top of the stairs.

Oh, but I'm rather you didn't disturb him, sir.
我希望您别打扰他，先生。

I was wondering if I'd send for the doctor.

609
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,340
A doctor, madam, would probably prescribe

610
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,170
a little less brandy in his soda.

I've been all over Brighton.

From one hotel to another,

tracking you down like some private detective.

-What do you want?  -What?

What do I want?

Good heavens, it's so dark in here.

00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,990
I think I've got a chill, I...
我想我是着凉了，我。。。

625
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,120
You must be out of your mind coming to a place like this.

I can't imagine what the food must be like.

Of course, as soon as I knew you were in Brighton,

我已经订了一间能看到海景的最豪华的套房。

631

And I shall get the bill, no doubt, in due course.
毫无疑问，到时候，我就会收到账单的。

632

Seriously though, Os, I won't allow you to stay

in this dreary little hovel another minute.

Just look at this picture, really.

Bosie, can't you understand

that I came here to finish my play in peace and quiet?
我来这里是为了平和安静地完成我的剧本（指《不可儿戏》）？

I was driven nearly frantic in London with you and your father.

Bosie, I've got to work.
波西，我得工作。

I'm the last person in the world to want to interfere with your work.
我可是这个世界上最后一个想干预你的作品的人。

641
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,950
Whether you mean it or not, you do.
不论你说的是或不是，你都这样干了。

642
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,860
What are you looking for?
你在找什么？

Here it is, for heaven's sake.
在这呢，天呐。

Really, Oscar, when you are ill, you've singularly unamusing.
真的，奥斯卡，当你病了的时候，你就更有魅力了。

I can't help being ill.

But you can help being a bore.

我很高兴听到这些。贫穷疾病成就了你。

坦率地说，我都不知道整件事情你是怎么想的。

You disappear, leaving me in town without a penny piece.
你去玩失踪，我却身无分文地被丢在城里。

Bosie, can't you see that I'm ill and I hardly know what I'm doing?

You mean for good?

再也不能这样下去了，你的疯狂暴怒和你的奢侈挥霍。

It's got to stop, Bosie.

he'd finally broken up our friendship?

My God, it is stuffy in here.

看在老天爷的份上，把窗户关上吧。

我还需要为我那个失疯的父亲说过的疯话负责吗？

Bosie, are you insane?

对昆斯博里侯爵提起文字中伤的诉讼

909
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,290
Does that mean, Sir Edward, that you will take the case?
这就是说，爱德华爵士，您将接手这个案子？

910
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,210
Well, the question is, of course,
那么，问题是，当然，

911
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,820
do you want to proceed with this action?
您是否要进行诉讼？

912
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,390
Well, of course!
当然要！

913
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,000
Why do you ask that, Sir Edward?
您为什么要问这个？爱德华爵士。

914
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,610
Well, no doubt, Queensberry's defense
那么，毫无疑问，昆斯博里的辩护

915
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,910
will be that the libelous statement complained of
将会是他的文字诽谤的观点的抱怨缘由

916
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,700
was justified and in effect true.
是否是合理公正的和有效真实的

917
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,610
It most certainly isn't true.
它显然不是真实的

918
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,010
Nevertheless, the defense will make every effort to prove that it is,
不过，他们的辩护将努力证明它是真实的，

919
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,450
and that could be extremely embarrassing for Mr. Wilde.
而这将使得王尔德先生很难堪。

920
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,450
I agree. Oscar, it simply isn't worth it.
我同意，奥斯卡，这样不值得。

921
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,190
Queensberry's obviously a lunatic.
昆斯博里显然是个疯子。

922
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,540
To take an action against him is exactly what he wants.
对他进行诉讼正是他想要的。

923
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,450
That's why he left that card.
这就是他为什么要留下这张纸条。

924
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,980
But if we let him get away with this,there'll be no holding him.
但是，如果让他这么逃脱，那就没什么阻挠他下一步的了。

925
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:05,330
We have to draw a line somewhere. It's a matter of principle.
我们必须明确界限，这是原则问题。

926
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,030
I'm afraid Lord Alfred is right.
我认为阿尔弗雷德爵士是对的。

927
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:09,070
The man must be stopped somewhere.
必须得有什么能够阻止这个人。

928
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,940
Then you wish to proceed with this action?
那么你将进行诉讼了？

929
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:13,470
I do.
我要。

930
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:16,170
Can't wait to see my father's face when I go into the witness box.
当我进入证人席，真想看看我父亲是什么狼狈相。

931
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,560
When I tell...

You're not going into the witness box, Bosie.

933
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,650
Are you mad, Oscar?

934
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,220
I've only got to tell them how he's...
只有我才能告诉大家他是。。。

935
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,000
How he's persecuted me these past two years,
过去两年中，他是怎么迫害我的，

936
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,870
how he drove my mother out of the house with his insane ravings.
怎么用疯话把我的母亲赶出那座房子的。

937
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,090
I'm not having you involved, Bosie.
我不想让你卷进来，波西。

938
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,530
I'm afraid, Mr. Wilde, that Lord Alfred is already involved.
王尔德先生，我恐怕，阿仁弗雷德爵士已经卷进来了。

939
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,320
Well, of course I'm involved.
那么，当然，我也就卷进来了。

940
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,800
I'm not having you exposed to more scandal than is necessary.
不到万不得已的时候，我不会让你曝光更多的绯闻。

941
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,580
Oscar, don't you realize...
奥斯卡，难道你没有意识到。。。

942
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,710
Bosie, you're not going into the witness box and that is final.
波西你不会进入证人席，就这么定了。

943
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,690
You'll have to forgive Bosie. He's a little impulsive.
你要原谅波西，他有点冲任性。

944
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,260
So it would seem.
好象是的。

945
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,780
Anyway, you have a very strong case, Mr. Wilde.
不管怎么样，王尔德先生，你将有一场很激烈的官司。

946
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,350
What's the matter, Robbie?
谁在乎呢，罗比？

947
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,270
Are you determined to bring about your own destruction, Oscar?
你这个决定将给你自己带来毁灭，奥斯卡？

948
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,530
Is that what you've trying to do?
这是你将要做的吗？

949
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,880
I don't understand.
我不明白。

950
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,840
I used to think you had a mind of your own.
我过去曾经认为你有自己的想法。

951
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,450
A great mind. Oh, really.
很伟大的思想，哦，真的。

952
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,270
Oscar, you mustn't let Bosie push you into this thing.
奥斯卡，你不能让波西把你推入这些事情。

953
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,970
-What's the alternative?    -Go abroad.
-那该怎么躲开呢？  -出国去。

954
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:23,150
Let Queensberry and his son fight their quarrel without you.
让昆斯博里父子互相斗争，而你置身其外。

955
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:24,280
They've well-matched.
他们俩旗鼓相当。

956
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,060
It's too late, Robbie.
这太晚了，罗比。

957

Well, Sir Edward, I'm entirely at your disposal.
好吧，爱德华爵士，我将随时听后你的吩咐。

Any further information you need?

01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:59,180
putting forward perverted moral views may be a good book?
提出一个歪曲道德标准的观点也能算是一本好书？

会引导一个普通个体
（书中道林格雷做出很多不道德的事情）

1197
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,600
to believe that it might have a certain tendency.

I have no knowledge of the views of ordinary individuals.

1199
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:30,780

“我不得不承认我疯狂地，放肆地，荒唐地仰慕你。”

describes the natural feeling of one man towards another?

Dorian Gray's was a remarkable personality.
道林格雷有着非常显着的个性。

May I take it that you as an artist have never known the feeling described here?
这里我是否可以把你当成（书中的）那个艺术家，你从来没有体验过这里描述的感觉?

1213
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:18,430
No. It is a work of fiction.

1214

Let us go over it phrase by phrase.

And we come now to the letter which you wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas.
现在我们来谈谈你写给阿尔弗雷德·道格拉斯勋爵的信。

It begins, "My own boy."
开头就是，“我的宝贝男孩."

1230
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,570

No, I like him.

1235
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,500
And that's not an ordinary letter.

1236
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,110
You might as well cross examine me

as to whether a Shakespeare sonnet was improper.

Suppose a man who was not an artist had written this letter.
设想一下，如果一个非艺术家的男人写下这样一封信

一个不是艺术家的男人也写不出这样的信。

1241

Well, I can suggest, for the sake of your reputation,
那么，我就提示一下，为了你的名誉考虑，

"Those red rose leaf lips of yours..."
“你的红玫瑰花瓣般的嘴唇。。。”

1244
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,520
It largely depends on how it's read.
这封信主要是取决于怎么去读它。

1245
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:55,220
"Your slim guilt soul walks between passion and poetry."
“你的纤细的愧疚心灵行走在激情和诗歌之间。”

1246
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,710
Is that a beautiful phrase, Mr. Wilde?
这是一个很优美语句吗？王尔德先生。

不是您这样读的，卡森先生，你读得太糟糕了。

And when I hear you give evidence,

1250
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,200
I've very glad that I am not.

1251
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,330
My Lord, I don't think mylearned friend should talk like that.
大人，我认为不该以这种方式与我博学的朋友谈话。

1252
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:15,980
May I suggest, Mr. Carson,
我能提示一下吗？卡森先生，

1253
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:19,990
that you do not air your personal opinions in this court?

It is very difficult, My Lord.
这很困难，大人。

1255
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,860
JUDGE: Yet nevertheless.

他来到我家。我想是在1893年1月。

I did, and I was determined to face it.
我想过，而且我决定要面对这件事。

以带他出去吃晚饭，还给他40英镑的方法吗？

Well, I saw that the letter was of no value,
其实，我当时认为那封信没那么值钱，

抗议这种，提问我博学的朋友的方式。

An immoral relationship with me, isn't that so?

considerable weight, Mr. Wilde.

我都无法想象那些不列颠的陪审员们在我面前怎么开口。

顺便说一句，明天你不用亲自到庭。

其实，你真的没有必要在这个国家出现。

You're be well advised to be on it.

1401
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:32,160
not to rise in such circumstances.

1402
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,990
I ask you to bear in mind that Lord Queensberry's son
我请你们记住，昆斯博里侯爵的儿子

1403
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:39,380
was so dominated by Wilde that he threatened to shoot his own father.
是受到王尔德的操控，而向自己父亲开枪的。

If he's been in my regiment, sir,

Live and let live, that's what I say.
别理它们，把它们放一边，这就是我想说的。

Mr. Wilde.

that have shocked me greatly.

而最高法院却没有打算，检控其中任何一个证人

They are to go scot-free.

Such a state of affairs has profoundly shaken

Thank you.

Mr. Wilde,

证人阿特金曾经在他自己的案子上做伪证。

Your Lordship dismissed this witness for that reason.
法官大人因为这个原因取消了他的证词。

证人的证词不受记录的影响，爱德华爵士。

In fact, these witnesses, according to you,

（出自圣经，两人之间心心相印，纯洁友爱）

Such as Plato made the very basis of philosophy
正如柏拉图奠定的哲学基础

It is a deep, spiritual affection

它都不敢说出它的名字。

And on account of it, I'm placed where I am today.
