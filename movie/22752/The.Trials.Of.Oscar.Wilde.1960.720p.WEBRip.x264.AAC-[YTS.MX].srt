3
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,191
-Get me a cab, will you?
-Yes, sir.

4
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,846
The most
brilliantly written
play I'’ve seen in years.

5
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,152
The man'’s a born wit.

6
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,849
The whole play was
tremendously exciting.

7
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,503
I hear he'’s writing a new one.

8
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:37,418
I can hardly wait to see it.

9
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,333
Cab!

10
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:42,466
Well, gentlemen, the English
theater has just given birth
to a genius.

11
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,860
I feel sure
Wilde would be the first
to agree with you, Harry.

12
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,558
I wish I could approve of
the playwright as much as
I approve of his play.

13
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,300
Who cares about him as long
as he continues to give us
plays like this?

14
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,074
Well, Oscar, how does it feel
to be a success?

15
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,858
Did you have
any doubts, Robbie?

16
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,954
Congratulations, Oscar.
Brilliant play! Brilliant!

17
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,043
Ah, there I'’m bound
to agree with you,
Lord Sonning.

18
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:42,787
My dear Mr. Wilde, I was
simply delighted with
your play.

19
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,962
I even enjoyed the interval.

20
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:49,272
Dear Lady Sonning,
she has the remains
of a remarkable ugliness.

21
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,101
I'’ve always been
a great admirer of
your work, Mr. Wilde.

22
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,277
And I'’ve always
been a great admirer
of my work, Mr. Shaw.

23
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,845
-Frank!
-Oscar!

24
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,238
-Wonderful play.
-Thank you.

25
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,761
-My dear lady mother.
-Oscar.

26
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:03,286
My dear boy, a triumph.
A magnificent triumph.

27
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,681
Ada, what are you going to say
about my play in that woman'’s
magazine you run?

28
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:09,074
I shall praise
it as highly as you
would yourself, Oscar.

29
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,554
You'’ve always been
the best critic
of my work.

30
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,600
-But I never
criticize your work.
-Exactly.

31
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:16,691
I'’m so proud, Oscar.

32
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,214
And I'’m so proud of you.

33
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,085
You look wonderful.

34
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,305
Oscar, people are watching.

35
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:23,915
I hardly think Oscar
is the type of man

36
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,743
to worry about his behavior
in public.

37
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,528
And how did brother Willie
like the play?

38
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,790
Or couldn'’t you
see it from the bar?

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,357
Ooh, I'’m perfectly sober,
thank you, Oscar.

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,141
I'’ve ordered a table
at the Savoy.

41
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,925
OSCAR: Get a cab, Robbie,
there'’s a good chap.
ROBBIE: Of course.

42
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,797
Constance, you don'’t mind
not coming.

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,929
-But you know,
these supper parties.
-Very well, Oscar.

44
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:40,062
-Mother will take you.
Now, won'’t you, Mother?
-Yes, of course.

45
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,759
-Willie, get my wrap.
-Goodbye, my dear.

46
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:42,630
Ada.

47
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,240
Come along, Bosie.

48
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,982
Good night, Mrs. Wilde.

49
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,070
Good night, Bosie.

50
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,729
A green carnation.
How delightfully eccentric.

51
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,296
Damned ridiculous,
if you ask me.

52
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,298
But who'’s the handsome
young boy with him?

53
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,300
Good heavens, Edith,
you are out of touch.

54
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,127
Why, the whole of London
is talking about them.

55
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:04,347
It'’s a damn disgrace
the way the fellow
is carrying on.

56
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,654
These artistic fellows
think they can get away
with anything.

57
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:07,959
But who is he? Well, you...

58
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,875
He'’s Lord Alfred Douglas.
Queensberry'’s son.

59
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,661
If I were Queensberry, I'’d...

60
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,228
You'’d do what, sir?
What would you do?

61
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,797
What would you do?

62
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,147
Excuse me.

63
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,456
Lord Alfred, you remember
my daughter?

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,240
-Oh, Mrs. Somers.
How do you do?
-Phyllis.

65
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,720
Poor Mrs. Somers.

66
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,201
Still trying to get
that daughter off
her hands.

67
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,072
Well, she'’s wasting
her time with him.

68
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,987
Oh, my lord.

69
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,337
You wicked man.

70
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,170
Bosie!

71
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,870
Don'’t you even
acknowledge me anymore?

72
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,175
What do you want, Father?

73
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,048
Have you any idea
how sick it makes me

74
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,137
to watch you making
a fool of yourself?

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,835
A fine spectacle you are, sir,
fawning and crawling round
this fellow, Wilde,

76
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,489
like some damn little lapdog.

77
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,143
Are we going to
have another one of
your scenes, Father?

78
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,406
Scenes or no scenes, sir.
I'’ll not tolerate
this behavior.

79
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,235
Would you sooner I went
around with professional
boxers and sporting gentry?

80
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,758
At least my friends
behave like men.

81
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,760
-Father, I'’m over 21...
-Only just.

82
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,762
I don'’t see that
I have to answer to
you for my behavior,

83
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,851
nor seek your permission
for the choice of my friends.

84
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,766
You are a disgrace to
the name of Queensberry!

85
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,768
I really don'’t have...
Bosie, is the cab ready yet?

86
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,337
Oscar, this unpleasant
little man is my father.

87
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,469
-Lord Queensberry?
-Yes.

88
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,687
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

89
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:24,775
The pleasure is entirely yours,
Mr. Wilde.

90
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,342
-Oscar, let'’s go.
-Just a minute.

91
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,865
-I have a few things
to say to this gentleman.
-Father!

92
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,563
-You listen to me, sir.
-Oh, really, Lord Queensberry.

93
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,303
I think the public
have had enough play
acting for one night.

94
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,001
I demand to be heard!

95
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:34,263
You are being heard, sir,
by the entire theater.
I should...

96
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:35,960
Well done, Wilde.

97
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,963
Most entertaining.
We both thought so,
didn'’t we, my dear?

98
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,617
You'’re very flattering,
Your Royal Highness.

99
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,576
And Mrs. Langtry,
you'’re very beautiful.

100
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,405
I adore flattery almost
as much as you do, Oscar.

101
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,537
I didn'’t know
you were a patron
of the arts, Queensberry.

102
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:51,149
I thought
fist fighting was
more in your line.

103
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,543
Well, thank you for a most
enjoyable evening, Wilde.

104
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,284
We shall look forward
to the next play.

105
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,245
Good night, sir.

106
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:01,943
You coming, Bosie?

107
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,035
Let me just say this, Father.
You'’ve been hounding me
long enough.

108
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,819
If you try and interfere
with me again,

109
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,691
or write anymore of
your abusive letters,

110
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,433
I shall have no hesitation
in seeking the protection
of the law.

111
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,305
You may have the law on your
hands much sooner than you
think, my boy.

112
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,426
Good morning, Edward.

113
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,733
Good morning, Mr. Wilde, sir.
Lovely morning.

114
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,996
Yes, I think I'’ll
walk a little. Follow.

115
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,261
Where to, sir?

116
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,132
The Cafe Royal.

117
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:03,221
Cafe Royal? Very good, sir.

118
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,928
Mr. Wilde. Mr. Wilde, sir.

119
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,147
Mr. Wilde, one thing my
readers are anxious to learn.

120
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,149
-What paper do
you write for, sir?
-The Echo,sir.

121
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:20,108
Well, if your readers
were anxious to learn
anything,

122
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,109
they wouldn'’t take the Echo.

123
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,548
May I ask you, sir,
why do you always wear
a green carnation?

124
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,115
REPORTER: Mr. Wilde,
your book Dorian Gray...

125
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,333
Wait a minute.
What did you say, sir?

126
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,900
Why do you always
wear a green carnation?

127
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,685
I consider nature
to be quite inadequate.

128
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,817
Why she never thought
of a green carnation,
I can'’t imagine.

129
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,906
REPORTER: Mr. Wilde.
No doubt she will
get around to it in time.

130
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,041
Mr. Wilde, your book
Dorian Grayhas been
severely criticized.

131
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:41,782
Not by me.

132
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,175
Yes, but, many people
do consider it immoral.

133
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,223
Ah, now, sir.
What is immorality?
I consider that to conform

134
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,921
to the narrow
moral standards of
this Victorian age

135
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,620
the grossest form
of immorality.

136
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,230
Yes, but, you know,
it is said, sir,

137
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,841
that much of your writing
and indeed your basic
philosophy

138
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,930
is fundamentally immoral.
What have you to say to that?

139
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,497
I may have offended
some people,

140
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,586
but I'’m sure that in 50 years,

141
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,501
the works of Oscar Wilde
will be standard literature

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,503
for every fifth form schoolboy.

143
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,678
Hear! Hear!

144
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,550
My only regret is
that I shan'’t be there

145
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,856
-to collect the royalties.

146
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,381
I must say I hardly
think a newspaperman

147
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,340
is in a position to
speak of immorality.

148
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:20,298
-What?
-Indeed, Lord Alfred.

149
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,605
Well, what could be more
immoral than a newspaper?

150
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,564
It condemns gambling
on the front page

151
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,783
and prints racing tips
on the back.

152
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,611
Brilliant, Bosie.
I wish I'’d said that.

153
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,657
You will, Oscar. You will.

154
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:35,183
When you go back to Oxford,
you can say you outwitted
Oscar Wilde.

155
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,620
If I ever go back,
I certainly will.

156
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:38,578
What do you mean?

157
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,538
Well, didn'’t you know?
I'’ve been sent down.

158
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,235
Congratulations!

159
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,324
All the best people
are being sent down
these days.

160
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,718
What did you do, Bosie?
Set fire to the
dean'’s trousers?

161
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,154
Waiter! Waiter!
More champagne.

162
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,983
Frankly I believe too much
education'’s a bad thing.

163
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,158
Don'’t you agree, Oscar?

164
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,856
I certainly do.

165
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,075
Ignorance is
a delicate blossom.
Touch it and it'’s gone.

166
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,777
You didn'’t tell me
that you'’d been sent down.

167
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:06,693
-Didn'’t I?
-No.

168
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,609
-Oh.
-Why?

169
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,089
It was all rather tedious.

170
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,787
Tedious or not,
I'’d like to hear about it.

171
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,316
Well, there was
some scandal over
a boy in the town.

172
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,274
You know how
provincial Oxford
can be in some ways.

173
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,756
Frankly, I find
the whole thing
rather amusing,

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,325
but unfortunately
my father didn'’t.

175
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:33,720
He was so disgusted with
his "so called son"
as he put it,

176
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,026
that he'’s disowned
me completely.

177
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,289
So now, I haven'’t
a penny in the world.

178
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,987
MAN: Frank, you'’re drunk.

179
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,902
FRANK: Drunk? Who'’s drunk?

180
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:45,035
Oscar, have you
ever seen me when I had
more than I could carry?

181
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,864
No, but I'’ve seen
you when you should have
taken more than one trip.

182
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,087
Why didn'’t you tell
me about this before?

183
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,697
Well, you were so busy,
what, with your play and...

184
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:58,570
If you'’re in any trouble,
you only have to come to me.

185
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,660
And if it'’s
money you need,
you needn'’t worry.

186
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,316
You'’re very kind to me, Oscar.

187
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,622
I'’m very fond of you.

188
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,582
Besides, what is
friendship for?

189
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,410
Come on, Mr. Wilde,
we'’re running out
of conversation.

190
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,977
As long as we'’re not
running out of wine.

191
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,415
Waiter! Waiter!

192
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,417
You know, gentlemen,
in the past few years,

193
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,854
I'’ve made
a remarkable discovery.

194
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,116
What was that, Oscar?

195
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,552
Alcohol, if taken in
sufficient quantities,

196
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,685
produces all the effects
of intoxication.

197
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,818
Gentlemen, I give you a toast.

198
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,212
To youth.

199
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,388
HARRIS: Oscar,
you talk as if
you'’re an old man.

200
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:35,738
I am. I'’d do anything
to regain my lost youth

201
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,654
except take up exercise or
get up early in the morning.

202
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,875
Waiter! Waiter,
where'’s that champagne?

203
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,354
MAN: Ah, thank you.
Here we are.

204
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:07,639
-Good evening, sir.
-Hello, Arthur.

205
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,468
Oscar! You said
you'’d be in for lunch.

206
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,776
Yes, I had a meeting
with my publisher.

207
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,299
The children have
been asking for you.

208
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,910
OSCAR: Oh.

209
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,521
They refuse
to go to sleep until
you tell them a story.

210
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,523
Oh, very well.

211
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,136
BOYS: Daddy! Daddy!

212
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,835
Now, what'’s all
this about your not sleeping?

213
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,880
We want you to tell us a story.

214
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,882
I see.

215
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,579
Well, now,
what shall I tell
you tonight about?

216
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:35,755
Not too long, Oscar.

217
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,148
Giants or dragons?

218
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:41,717
You told us the story
about giants last night.

219
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,199
Well, have I told you
the story about
the Happy Prince?

220
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,069
No.

221
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:50,247
High above the city
on a tall column

222
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,642
stood the statue
of the Happy Prince.

223
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:57,733
He was gilded all over
with thin leaves
of fine gold.

224
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:02,216
For eyes he had
two bright sapphires

225
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:05,262
and a large red ruby
glowed on his sword hilt.

226
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:09,527
He was as beautiful
as a weather cock.

227
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,841
Yes, sir?

228
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,625
Mr. Oscar Wilde?

229
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,758
I don'’t know that
he'’s at home, sir.

230
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,412
Ah. My name is Wood.

231
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:25,979
-Wood, sir?
-Yes.

232
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,850
I'’m a friend of
Lord Alfred Douglas.

233
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:30,984
Oh, I see, sir.
Would you step
inside, sir?

234
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:34,117
I'’ll enquire if Mr. Wilde
will see you, sir.

235
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:36,728
"Dear little swallow,"
said the prince.

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,515
"You tell me marvelous things,

237
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,780
"but more marvelous
than anything

238
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,739
"is the suffering
of men and women."

239
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:55,617
Excuse me, sir.
There'’s a person
to see you, sir.

240
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,748
Very well.

241
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,935
-He gave his name as Wood, sir.
-Wood?

242
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:10,937
Said he was a friend
of Lord Alfred'’s, sir.

243
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,981
Oh, I see.

244
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,156
He'’s in the front room, sir.

245
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,549
Thank you, Arthur.

246
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,422
Mr. Wood?

247
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,383
That'’s right, sir.

248
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:26,604
Oh. Very delicate.
Very delicate indeed.

249
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,911
I understand you are
a friend of Lord Alfred'’s.

250
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:32,001
Uh, well, I suppose
you might say that,
sir, yes.

251
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,656
A very friendly gentleman,
His Lordship, sir,
very friendly.

252
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,745
Well, he didn'’t mention you,
Mr. Wood, but...

253
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,921
Uh, Alfred Wood, sir.

254
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:41,097
Same name as His Lordship, sir.

255
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,794
I'’m no lord, of course, sir,

256
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,754
but as a poet like
yourself might say,
"What'’s in a name?"

257
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,191
Cognac, Mr. Wood?

258
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,062
Thank you, sir.

259
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,847
You knew Lord Alfred at Oxford?

260
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,676
Well, not
exactly at Oxford, sir.

261
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,678
No, sir,
not in the way
that you might mean.

262
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:59,637
I used
to do odd jobs
for His Lordship.

263
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,770
Oh, very kind he
was to me, sir. Yes.

264
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:04,077
A gentleman
like yourself, sir,
in every particular.

265
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,036
Thank you, sir.
Well, I'’m very glad to
meet any friend of Bosie'’s.

266
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,168
Bosie?

267
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,647
Oh.

268
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,345
Yes, of course, sir.

269
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,657
Your health, sir.

270
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,060
Very fine brandy this, sir.
Drives the cold from
the bones.

271
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,980
Well, I, uh...

272
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:40,200
I won'’t beat about
the bush, sir,
as the saying goes.

273
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,340
Quite by accident, sir,
I assure you, I a...

274
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:54,997
I came across
that letter from you
to Lord Alfred Douglas.

275
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,131
Very beautiful letter,
if I might say so, sir.

276
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,264
Only I think that perhaps

277
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:05,138
there are parts that
could be "misconstrued,"
I think is the word, sir.

278
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,531
How did you come by this?

279
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,142
Ah, yes, well, I used to...

280
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,187
Used to press
Lord Alfred'’s clothes.

281
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,668
Very particular
about his clothes, sir.

282
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:14,538
As well you may know.

283
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:18,020
I, uh, found it
in one of his pockets.

284
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:21,371
Are you asking me to
purchase my own work,
Mr. Wood?

285
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:24,635
Well, sir, I...
Come, sir, that'’s not
very sound economics.

286
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:28,335
Well, I'’ve already
been offered £60
for it, sir.

287
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:31,425
Then I suggest that
you sell it at once.

288
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:34,123
I myself have seldom
been offered so much

289
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,343
for a prose work
of that length.

290
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,824
You take the letter, sir.

291
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,044
It was stupid of me
to try and rent you.

292
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,916
The thing is, sir,
that I'’m desperate
for money and...

293
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,223
A hungry man gets
driven to do stupid things.

294
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,051
Oh, would you like
a ham sandwich?

295
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,400
Now you'’re making
fun of me, sir.

296
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,054
On the
contrary, Mr. Wood.

297
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,448
You'’re doing
remarkably well yourself.

298
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,971
Well, I think I'’ll
be going now, sir.

299
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,800
No, no, no, no.
Please stay and
finish your drink.

300
00:16:58,843 --> 00:16:59,844
That'’s very kind of you.

301
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:07,156
You'’re a very poor criminal,
Mr. Wood, if I may say so.

302
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,205
The fact is
I came to London
to look for some work.

303
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,773
Ah, work, Mr. Wood, is the
curse of the drinking classes.

304
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,083
The secret of maintaining youth

305
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:27,611
is an inordinate
passion for pleasure.

306
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,490
£40, sir?

307
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,580
I'’m going
out to dine in a moment.
Perhaps you'’d care to join me.

308
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,886
Well, that'’s very kind
of you, sir.

309
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,410
There'’s a fascinating charm

310
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:47,283
about your halfhearted
criminal tendencies,
Mr. Wood.

311
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:51,374
I suspect that you lead
a wonderfully wicked life.

312
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,681
Ah, well,
there'’s good and
bad in all of us, sir.

313
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,422
Mr. Wood, you'’re
a born philosopher.

314
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,206
I'’m sure we shall
get along extremely well.

315
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,077
Your health, sir.

316
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,704
Shall I serve dinner, madam?

317
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,229
I can'’t understand it.
I'’m sure Mr. Wilde said

318
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,013
he would be in for dinner.

319
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,973
Well, perhaps
he'’s been detained
on business, madam.

320
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,235
Yes.

321
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,106
Shall we wait?

322
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,718
No, Arthur, I'’ll dine alone.

323
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:31,588
Very well, madam.

324
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,008
Bosie, you'’re
nearly an hour late.

325
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,878
Yes, I know.

326
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,707
Oh, I know what
that face means.

327
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,275
It usually heralds
an unpleasant scene.

328
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,147
It would be nice
if it could be avoided.

329
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,018
I'’m in a singularly good mood.

330
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,281
-Are you?
-I was.

331
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,066
No doubt, having
entertained your friend
at the Savoy last night.

332
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,765
You mean Mr. Wood?

333
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,202
Really, Oscar, have
you no sense of propriety?

334
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,421
The man is a valet.

335
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,684
A very amusing valet.

336
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:27,731
Thank heavens, Bosie,
I am not inhibited
by your sense of class.

337
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,472
So it seems.

338
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,952
Anyway, he was your friend.

339
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,694
I hardly knew the man.

340
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,609
That'’s not the impression
that he gave to me.

341
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,132
WAITER: Good morning, My Lord.

342
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,829
What did he want anyway?

343
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,831
Money. What do
the poor usually want?

344
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,355
Would you like to
order now, My Lord?

345
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,530
And you gave it to him?

346
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:47,360
For a valuable
piece of property.

347
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,753
A letter I wrote you at Oxford.

348
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,451
WAITER: May I recommend
the lobster, My Lord?

349
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,019
-I'’ll have the sole meuniere.
-Very good.

350
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:58,632
Do you mean he blackmailed you?

351
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:02,723
Leaving that letter
around for anyone to find
was not only careless of you,

352
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,812
but singularly
lacking in respect

353
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,076
for something
that I'’d hoped was
private and personal.

354
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,514
Waiter, bring some
champagne right away.

355
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:12,385
Very good, My Lord.

356
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,999
It'’d seem, Bosie,
that I am forever paying

357
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,523
for your indiscretions
and your extravagances.

358
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,221
Money, is that all
you ever think of?

359
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,919
Ah, when I was young
I thought money was
everything.

360
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,660
Now that I'’m older
I know that it is.

361
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,792
My God, Oscar,
you'’re never satisfied.

362
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:29,924
You have a successful book out,

363
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,142
a play running
in the West End...

364
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,449
Playing to packed
houses of creditors.

365
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:36,322
Have you any idea
how much money I'’ve spent
since we'’ve been together?

366
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,281
I'’m sure you've
kept an account.

367
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:43,590
Luncheon every day here,
dinner at the Savoy,
supper at...

368
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,287
-Oh, look what you'’ve done.
-I'’m sorry, sir.

369
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,854
-Please.
-Oh, go away, stop fussing.

370
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,292
And always the best champagne

371
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,512
because you have
a very delicate palate.

372
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,863
Bosie, you seem to think
that you have a right to
live at my expense

373
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,823
in a profuse luxury to
which you have never
been accustomed.

374
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:03,305
I pay
your hotel bills,
your tailor'’s bill,

375
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,698
your gambling debts.

376
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:09,703
You demand
without grace and you
receive without thanks.

377
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,358
Have you finished?

378
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,146
Now tell
me honestly, Oscar.
What did you expect, hmm?

379
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,583
Did you think I was
some common street Arab

380
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,237
to be bought
with cheap trinkets

381
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,501
and an occasional supper
in some Soho restaurant?

382
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,851
I'’ve given
you my friendship
for two years, Oscar.

383
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:31,333
I'’ve admired your genius,
laughed at your jokes,
flattered your vanity.

384
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,771
And now you question the
price of such a friendship.

385
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,556
It isn'’t worthy of you, Oscar.

386
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,731
-Good evening, Mr. Wilde.
-Evening, William.

387
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:23,124
Sydney.

388
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,387
Thank you, sir.

389
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,476
-Good evening, Mr. Wilde.
-Good evening.

390
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,001
I want you to take
this to this address.

391
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,700
It'’s just around the corner.

392
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,747
-Straight away, hmm?
-Right away, sir.

393
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:42,448
Hello, Robbie.

394
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,014
Hello, Oscar.

395
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,147
What will you have?

396
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,671
Brandy, and a large one.

397
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,456
John. A large brandy.

398
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,459
Give me a cigarette,
there'’s a dear fellow.

399
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:54,503
I seem to have
left mine at home.

400
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,810
-What?
-A cigarette.

401
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:57,941
Oh, yes, of course.

402
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,248
Thank you.

403
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,607
What is it, Oscar?
Are you not well?

404
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,479
No, just very tired,
that'’s all.

405
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,394
Your brandy, sir.

406
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,309
Thank you.

407
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:25,708
Oscar, did you know that
some of the club members

408
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,884
have approached
the Committee
to get you to resign?

409
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,669
Well, I hope not. I shall
have to find somewhere else

410
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,410
to sleep in the afternoons.

411
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,412
Have you any idea how much
people are talking about you

412
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,543
or what they are saying?

413
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,850
I adore scandal
about other people,

414
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,505
but about myself
I find it extremely dull.

415
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,507
It hasn'’t the charm of novelty.

416
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,901
I don'’t think you'll
find this gossip dull.

417
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:47,687
Robbie, are you being
solicitous about my welfare?

418
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,471
That is very
impertinent of you.

419
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,994
I don'’t mean to be.

420
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,997
Oscar, I realize
that much of your
extravagant behavior

421
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,260
is done purely for effect.
You'’re an artist.

422
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,349
The public expects
you to be different.

423
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:01,396
But you'’re no longer
an ascetic young poet
just down from Oxford.

424
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
-Relax.
-You'’re a highly
successful playwrighter

425
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,400
at the peak of your career.

426
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,795
You dine with royalty.
You mix in the highest
social circles.

427
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,579
Ah.

428
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,102
You'’re walking along
a precipice, Oscar.

429
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,714
Just as long
as you continue
to play court jester,

430
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,063
society will accept you.

431
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,674
But tax their tolerance too far

432
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,633
and they'’ll send you
crashing from the heights

433
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,678
-to the depths of obscurity.
-Oh, really.

434
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,507
A halo doesn'’t have to fall
very far, Oscar, to become
a noose.

435
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,378
Really, Robbie,
this all very tedious.

436
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,511
Just tell me one thing.

437
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,732
These stories I hear about you.

438
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,516
There isn'’t any truth
in them, is there?

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,909
As I don'’t know
what the stories are,

440
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,258
I'’m hardly in a position
to answer you.

441
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,086
They say that you...

442
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:43,394
You'’re being
blackmailed because of
your association with Bosie.

443
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:48,530
That you consort with
criminals, stable boys.

444
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,231
This sounds all very
exciting and intriguing.

445
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:55,668
Do go on.

446
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,496
I just want to hear
you tell me it isn'’t true.

447
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:02,196
Robbie,

448
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:06,026
I'’m deeply hurt
that you use our friendship
to pry into my private life.

449
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,206
I thought
you were a gentleman.
I now see that you are not.

450
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,990
I just want to
hear you deny it, Oscar.

451
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,036
You must think
what you will, Robbie.

452
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:18,821
Mr. Wood to see you, sir.

453
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:19,692
Thank you.

454
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:30,746
Robbie, because
I'’m very fond of you

455
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,443
I shall forget everything
you'’ve said tonight.

456
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,489
Good night.

457
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,186
Good night.

458
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,670
Hello, Oscar.

459
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,589
Lovely club you'’ve got here.

460
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,113
-I like that.

461
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,724
I'’d like some
champagne tonight.

462
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,613
Oh, you shouldn'’t
have bothered.

463
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,050
You must eat something.

464
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,753
All right?

465
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,363
You know, I'’ve eaten in all
of the best restaurants
in Europe

466
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,583
but I'’ve never tasted
anything like your
sweetbreads.

467
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,367
Where'’s the wine?

468
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,978
They didn'’t deliver
any this week.

469
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,590
For heaven'’s sake, why not?

470
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,593
Perhaps the fact that we
owe the wine merchant £85

471
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,856
might have something
to do with it.

472
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,641
We'’re living on credit,
Oscar, and that can'’t
go on much longer.

473
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,253
Well, if I can
finish this play,
everything will be all right.

474
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:47,344
If that'’s Bosie,
tell him I'’m not at home.

475
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,524
QUEENSBERRY: I wish
to see Mr. Oscar Wilde.

476
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,570
ARTHUR: I'’m sorry, sir,
but Mr. Wilde is not at home.

477
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,832
Well, I'’m sorry,
but I demand to
see him.

478
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:57,790
You can'’t go in there, sir.

479
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,182
If you please, sir.

480
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,706
Wilde, I want to have
a word with you. Sit down.

481
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:05,319
Well, Lord Queensberry.
It'’s all right, Arthur,
you can go.

482
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:08,365
It seems
the peerage don'’t have
a monopoly of good manners.

483
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,237
To hell with good manners, sir.

484
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,935
What I have to say
to you has very little
to do with good manners.

485
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,285
Indeed?
And I presume you'’ve
brought your ugly friend

486
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,983
to lend you moral support.

487
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,202
When it comes
to morals, I have
all the support I need,

488
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,161
thank you very much.

489
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,467
I'’ve seldom
come across anybody in whom
the moral sense was dominant

490
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:27,341
who was not heartless,
cruel, vindictive
and completely lacking

491
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,430
in the smallest
sense of humanity,
Lord Queensberry.

492
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:32,738
Personally,
I'’d sooner have
50 unnatural vices

493
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,435
than one unnatural virtue.

494
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,612
Yes, I can
well believe that.
Now, you listen to me, sir.

495
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,266
I presume you have
come to make a speech.

496
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,921
If so,
I hope it'’s a short one
because I have work to do.

497
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:46,665
Wilde.

498
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:49,798
Wilde.

499
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:54,934
I'’ve come here today
to protest against

500
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,676
your disgusting
relationship with my son.

501
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,728
That is a revolting
and slanderous statement,

502
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,556
and I demand an apology.

503
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,297
I refuse to apologize.

504
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,258
I refuse to apologize for
saying something which is
common knowledge

505
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,739
to every cab driver
and messenger boy
in London.

506
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,610
Lord Queensberry,
are you seriously
suggesting that

507
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,830
there is improper conduct
between your son and myself?

508
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,268
I do not say that you are.

509
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:28,271
I say
that you look it,
which is just as bad.

510
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,490
But I'’ll tell you this.

511
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,189
If I catch you
two again together,

512
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:37,803
I shall take a whip to you,
sir, and I shall thrash
you to the ground.

513
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,461
I see that when
it comes to fighting,

514
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,508
you choose to ignore
the Queensberry rules.

515
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,640
-Yes, well,
I give you fair warning.
-And I give you fair warning.

516
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,730
If you'’re not out of
my house in two minutes,
I shall throw you out.

517
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,253
I refuse to leave
until I'’ve had my say.

518
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,255
On the contrary, sir,
you are leaving now.

519
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,736
Hit him! Hit him!

520
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:04,307
Arthur, open the door!
This gentleman is leaving.

521
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,265
Gladly, sir.

522
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,922
This, Arthur,
is the Marquis
of Queensberry.

523
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,707
The most infamous brute in
London and you'’re never to
let him in my house again.

524
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,013
-Is that clear?
-Perfectly, sir.

525
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,319
Now get out.

526
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,799
Very well.

527
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,888
But you'’ll regret this,
I promise you.

528
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,020
I promise you.

529
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,329
Go back to your room
this instant.

530
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:29,376
Will that be all, sir?

531
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,594
I hope so, Arthur.

532
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,218
Now, this has got to stop.

533
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,439
You are the only one
who can stop it, Oscar.

534
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,964
My God, am I
not allowed to get on
with my work in peace?

535
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,617
What with creditors
knocking at the door

536
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,532
and Bosie dropping in
as if this was some
sort of club.

537
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,579
And now this coarse brute
with his hired pugilists.

538
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,669
I can stand brute force,
but brute reason is
quite intolerable.

539
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,801
It'’s like hitting
below the intellect.

540
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:10,417
Oscar, I beg of you
to give up this friendship
with Bosie.

541
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,160
Not for me,
but for your own sake.

542
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,205
He takes up
too much of your time,

543
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,207
demands too much
of your emotions.

544
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,253
I know.

545
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:25,171
The truth is the boy has
a strange fascination
for me

546
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,174
that I can'’t get free of.

547
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:34,571
He needs you more
than you need him.

548
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:37,574
He needs you
because he is
weak and conceited.

549
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,142
And you give him
a stature he could
never acquire alone.

550
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,884
And he will
go on taking and taking
until there'’s nothing left.

551
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,538
He'’ll destroy you, Oscar.

552
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,281
When I married you,

553
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:51,675
I didn'’t believe
it was possible to love
anybody more than I loved you.

554
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,899
I still love you, darling.

555
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:01,685
To me you are higher and
greater than any man in
the world.

556
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:02,904
Help me, Constance.

557
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,427
Help me.

558
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,651
Why not go away
for a little while?

559
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,436
At least until you
have finished your play.

560
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,830
Maybe it will
give you a chance
to think more clearly.

561
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:17,745
Yes, I may.

562
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:22,445
You always liked the sea.
Why not go down to Brighton?

563
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:24,186
It should be very quiet
at this time of year.

564
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:28,016
It'’s a wonderful idea,
Constance,

565
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,194
but we'’ve hardly enough money
to pay the tradesmen,
let alone hotel bills.

566
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:35,197
I haven'’t
touched my father'’s
allowance for some months.

567
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:36,851
-It isn'’t very much,
I'’m afraid.
-No, no, Constance.

568
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,200
Please. Please.

569
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,426
I love you.

570
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,602
I love you.

571
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:55,190
Goodness Lordy, Mr. Wilde,
wherever have you been?

572
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,497
I'’ve been conversing
with the elements,
Mrs. Burgess.

573
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,325
Oh, goodness me,
you'’re soaked
to the skin.

574
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,936
Listening to the wisdom
of the sea, Mrs. B.

575
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,764
Out all night
in weather like this.

576
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:06,245
Now, you come upstairs
and we'’ll get those
wet clothes off

577
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,681
-before you catch your death.
-It'’s all here.

578
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,422
Every word and every epigram,
Mrs. Burgess.

579
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,119
Oh, I'’m very glad, Mr. Wilde,
but do come on.

580
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:12,816
Every move and every curtain.

581
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,166
It'’s all here.

582
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,168
And the
important thing
is who is Ernest.

583
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:17,299
Oh, yes, that will be nice.

584
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:18,866
Ernest and his little aunt...

585
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,347
But upstairs now, like
a good boy, please,
Mr. Wilde.

586
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,613
You'’re very kind, Mrs. Burgess.

587
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:30,704
Well, if we can'’t show
a little kindness
on this earth,

588
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,881
we might
as well not be here,
that'’s the way I see it.

589
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,841
Now, you keep nice and warm.

590
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:02,388
Are you sure this is
the right place,
my dear chap?

591
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,955
This is where
I brung him, sir.
No mistaking him.

592
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,870
Proper artistic
gentleman he was.

593
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:07,915
Just wait here, will you?

594
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:08,785
Right, sir.

595
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,188
Good morning, madam.

596
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:23,887
Is it remotely possible you
have a Mr. Oscar Wilde
staying here?

597
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:24,932
Why, yes, sir.

598
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,587
How extraordinary.

599
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,893
-Ah, may I step inside?
-Certainly, sir.

600
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,983
Which is his room?

601
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:34,550
It'’s just at
the top of the stairs.

602
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,770
Oh, but I'’d rather
you didn'’t disturb him, sir.

603
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,860
You see, he was out
all night and he'’s
not at all well.

604
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,689
Indeed?

605
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:45,518
I was wondering if
I'’d send for the doctor.

606
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,346
A doctor, madam,
would probably
prescribe

607
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,174
a little less brandy
in his soda.

608
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,007
Well.

609
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,229
So this is
where you'’ve been
hiding yourself, hmm?

610
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:02,535
Bosie.

611
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,189
Really, Oscar, you are
the most tedious person.

612
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:05,712
I'’ve been all over Brighton.

613
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:07,061
From one hotel to another,

614
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,498
tracking you down like
some private detective.

615
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,847
-What do you want?
-What?

616
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:12,849
What do I want?

617
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,374
I don'’t want a thing,
I came to see you.

618
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,115
Good heavens,
it'’s so dark in here.

619
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,817
Well, I must say
you don'’t look
any too good.

620
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,035
Oh, yeah.

621
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,994
I think I'’ve got a chill, I...

622
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:29,127
You must
be out of your mind
coming to a place like this.

623
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,606
I can'’t imagine what
the food must be like.

624
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,260
Of course,
as soon as I knew
you were in Brighton,

625
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:33,783
I naturally went
straight to The Grand.

626
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,959
Naturally.

627
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,745
I have a most delightful
suite there overlooking
the sea.

628
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:42,096
And I shall get the bill,
no doubt, in due course.

629
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,838
Seriously though, Os,
I won'’t allow you to stay

630
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,101
in this dreary little hovel
another minute.

631
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,670
Besides, the most fascinating
people are staying at
The Grand.

632
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,457
Just look
at this picture, really.

633
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,938
Bosie, can'’t you understand

634
00:35:57,981 --> 00:36:01,289
that I came here
to finish my play
in peace and quiet?

635
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,510
I was driven
nearly frantic in London
with you and your father.

636
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:07,165
Bosie, I'’ve got to work.

637
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,080
I'’m the last
person in the world to want
to interfere with your work.

638
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,952
Whether you mean it or not,
you do.

639
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,867
What are you looking for?

640
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,260
I'’m looking for
my handkerchief. What do
you think I'’m looking for?

641
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,653
Here it is, for heaven'’s sake.

642
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:19,916
Really, Oscar,
when you are ill,
you'’re singularly unamusing.

643
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,179
I can'’t help being ill.

644
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,876
But you can help being a bore.

645
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,622
Is this your new play?

646
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:30,840
"The Importance
of Being Earnest."

647
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,236
Yes, it'’s nearly finished.

648
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,545
I'’m glad to hear it.
Poverty ill becomes you.

649
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:43,288
Frankly, I think you'’re being
very unreasonable about this
whole thing.

650
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,813
You disappear,
leaving me in town
without a penny piece.

651
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:48,815
Are you trying to end
this relationship, Oscar?

652
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,469
Is that what you want?

653
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:53,211
I don'’t know what I want.
I just want to be left
in peace.

654
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,734
"Thank you for your company.

655
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,910
"It was charming while it
lasted. Now kindly get out."

656
00:36:56,953 --> 00:37:00,087
Bosie, can'’t you see that I'm
ill and I hardly know what
I'’m doing?

657
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,871
And what about me?

658
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,308
I don'’t care what you do,

659
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,613
but as long
as you go away
and leave me alone.

660
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,921
You mean for good?

661
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:13,927
It can'’t go on,
your insane tantrums
and your extravagances.

662
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,451
It'’s got to stop, Bosie.

663
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:19,759
Wouldn'’t my father
be delighted to think

664
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,630
he'’d finally broken up
our friendship?

665
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,197
My God, it is stuffy in here.

666
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,807
I don'’t know
how you can breathe.

667
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:28,420
Once and for all, I'’m sick
to death of being a cat'’s-paw

668
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,291
in this terrible war
between you and
your father.

669
00:37:31,597 --> 00:37:33,425
And for heaven'’s sake,
close the window.

670
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:35,949
Am I to be held responsible
for the ravings of my
lunatic father?

671
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,081
I sometimes think there'’s very
little difference between him
and you.

672
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,909
You'’re both insane.
Bosie, the window.

673
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,390
My God, I'’ve had
just about had as much
as I can stand of this.

674
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,044
-Oh, my God.
-Is this the thanks I get

675
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:45,611
-for devoting myself to
you these past two years?
-My God!

676
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:46,916
What is happening to me?

677
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,744
How I ever came to think
you were so marvelous...

678
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,051
-Bosie, for God'’s sake,
go away.
-Oscar Wilde, the great genius,

679
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,835
the great wit.

680
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,968
Idol of society. And look
at you sniveling like
some kicked dog.

681
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:58,058
Do you think I'’m
going to let you end
this so easily, Oscar?

682
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,712
You'’re not going
to throw me aside

683
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:01,191
because you'’ve
no further use for me.

684
00:38:01,235 --> 00:38:02,628
You'’re not my father!

685
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,067
Bosie, are you insane?

686
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,503
Didn'’t you know?
It runs in the family.

687
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,548
Bosie, put it down.

688
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,245
Bosie, please!

689
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:23,866
How insignificant you look
when you'’re afraid, Oscar.

690
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,870
I never thought
you'’d be afraid of me.

691
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,752
Oh, this place depresses me.

692
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,858
Oh, um...

693
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:02,122
I don'’t suppose you could let
me have some money to pay the
cab, could you? I...

694
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:06,735
Oh, well.

695
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,458
Wait for me, will you?

696
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,372
Yes, ma'’am.

697
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,167
Good afternoon, madam.
Good afternoon, Arthur.

698
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,473
Is Mr. Wilde at home?

699
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,170
Yes, he'’s working
at the moment, madam.

700
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:52,172
But Mrs. Wilde is
in the front room.

701
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,570
-Mrs. Leverson, madam.
-CONSTANCE: Ada!

702
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:00,572
My dear,
I hope you don'’t mind
my just dropping in.

703
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:02,704
Of course not. Arthur,
may we have some tea,
please?

704
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,184
Certainly, madam.

705
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,968
How nice to see you.
Good heavens, you'’re freezing.

706
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:07,753
Come and get warm by the fire.

707
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,930
I was just embroidering
my birthday present
for Oscar.

708
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,714
Do you think
he'’s going to like it?

709
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:16,196
Oh, I'’m sure he will,
it'’s most handsome.

710
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,591
Oscar has
the most expensive tastes,
even in the simplest things.

711
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:20,679
How is Oscar?

712
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,071
Oh, much better.

713
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,160
He just needed
looking after properly.

714
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,645
What about Bosie?

715
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,608
That'’s all over now, thank God.

716
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:39,785
I can'’t tell you
what it was like, Ada.

717
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,874
To have
a woman come between
yourself and your husband,

718
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:43,571
that'’s something
a wife can understand.

719
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:46,444
But another man.

720
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,101
OSCAR: Constance,
is that Ada'’s voice I hear?

721
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,668
Yes, it is, dearest.

722
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,149
I must hide this, I don'’t
want to spoil the surprise.

723
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,195
Ada, my dear.

724
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,762
You'’re looking
wonderful, Oscar.

725
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:03,156
Mm, what a delicious hat!

726
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,463
Constance, where'’s that bottle
of champagne I'’ve been
hoarding?

727
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,595
Oscar, you'’re not going
to start drinking so early.

728
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,728
Of course I am.
This is a celebration.

729
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:10,946
You finished the play?

730
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,557
The curtain fell
on the third act of

731
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,646
The Importance
of Being Earnest
as the doorbell rang.

732
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,821
I'’ll get the champagne.

733
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,213
Ada, your timing is impeccable.

734
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:19,215
-Is it a good play?
-Quite extraordinary.

735
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:21,304
Ada, I'’m happier than
I'’ve been for years.

736
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,481
I'’m working.
I'’m seeing more
of the children.

737
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,439
Constance is a guardian angel.

738
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,922
In fact, I believe
I'’m getting dull and
bourgeois and very old.

739
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,057
You miss him, don'’t you?

740
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:38,670
Yes.

741
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:45,503
Sometimes when I see the
sunlight on an evening sky

742
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,942
or wander by the river
and watch the dark waters,

743
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,250
I seem to see him
flitting by me in
the darkness,

744
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,603
and then I feel terribly alone.

745
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:06,001
Have you seen this?

746
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:13,966
Couldn'’t find
the champagne glasses.

747
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:16,359
It'’s been
such a long time
since we used them.

748
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:19,188
Oscar, what on earth is it?

749
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:24,585
Bosie'’s elder brother
was killed yesterday
in a hunting accident.

750
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,979
Oh, how terrible.

751
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,807
That would be Francis,
wouldn'’t it?

752
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,939
Bosie was very fond
of him, wasn'’t he?

753
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:32,767
-Arthur.
-Sir?

754
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:35,422
I want you
to go to the post office
presently and send a telegram.

755
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:36,292
Very good, sir.

756
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,643
I think he may need me.

757
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:49,088
For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God

758
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:54,223
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear
brother departed,

759
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,662
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

760
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,333
Well...

761
00:44:01,943 --> 00:44:04,903
It would seem it takes
a death to bring about

762
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:07,253
a family reunion in this house.

763
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,351
You'’re all very silent.

764
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:21,484
I'’ve just lost a son.

765
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:23,661
Doesn'’t that mean
anything to any of you?

766
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:26,620
Hmm?

767
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:34,889
You'’re his mother.
Don'’t you weep
for your son?

768
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:39,241
The only real male son
you ever bore.

769
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:42,462
-Really, Father...
-The only real man
among the three of you!

770
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:56,476
Goodbye, Mother.

771
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:57,390
Goodbye, Bosie.

772
00:44:58,086 --> 00:44:58,913
Bosie!

773
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:04,614
Where the devil do
you think you'’re going?

774
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,140
I'’ve buried my brother.

775
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:11,447
There'’s nothing
to keep me here any longer.

776
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,319
This is
your home, damn you!

777
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:16,931
You belong here!

778
00:45:17,976 --> 00:45:20,630
You were born here!

779
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:24,199
Kinmount has been
the House of Douglas
for more than 300 years.

780
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,984
-Goodbye, Percy.
-Bosie!

781
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:32,512
Bosie.

782
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,996
Don'’t go, boy. Stay here.

783
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,475
Just for a few days, eh?

784
00:45:41,826 --> 00:45:45,220
It gets so lonely
here sometimes
and...

785
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:49,094
Well, just for a few days,
eh, Son?

786
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:53,054
You call me son?

787
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,710
I'’m not your son.

788
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,713
You disowned me,
or had you forgotten?

789
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,671
You disowned me
just as you'’ve disowned
the whole family.

790
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:02,934
You drove Mother
out of this house

791
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,980
with your abuse
and your immorality.

792
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,940
You persecuted me until I
had to keep away from you

793
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:11,464
for fear of what
I might do if I were
here to lay hands on you.

794
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,077
I tried to make
a man out of you.

795
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,341
I tried to protect you
against yourself.

796
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,256
It'’s no more than any other
self-respecting father
would do.

797
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,346
You lost your self respect
the day you threw my mother
out of this house

798
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,566
and brought your mistress
here to live with you.

799
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:31,963
-Damn your insolence!
-Please!

800
00:46:32,006 --> 00:46:34,095
I ought to take a whip
and thrash you to the ground.

801
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:35,967
I would welcome
the opportunity,
believe me.

802
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,620
You talk to me
of the moral issue.

803
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:39,013
-For heaven'’s sake,
-Father!

804
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:40,449
Well, what about him and
that damned Wilde fellow?

805
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:43,801
Thank God I succeeded
in putting an end to that.

806
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:46,064
One of these days
you'’ll get down on your knees

807
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:47,369
and you'’ll thank me for it.

808
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,417
He sent me a telegram
this morning.

809
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,986
At least he has more sympathy
with my bereavement than you
seem to have.

810
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,858
I'’m going back to London
this afternoon,
and I warn you,

811
00:46:57,902 --> 00:47:01,383
if ever
you try and interfere in
my private affairs again,

812
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:05,823
I'’ll buy myself a pistol
and I'’ll hunt you down
and kill you.

813
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,014
Bosie!

814
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,717
Bosie!

815
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,591
Bosie!

816
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:37,724
You'’re no son of mine,
do you hear?

817
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:40,901
You'’re not my son!

818
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,381
Go back to your
precious friend,

819
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:44,557
but, I warn you,
I haven'’t finished
with you yet!

820
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,385
Or him!

821
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:48,343
I'’ll see you both behind bars!

822
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,476
Do you hear?

823
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,391
Behind bars!

824
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,063
I have a great deal to
make up to you for, Oscar.

825
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,457
I'’ve been perfectly
horrible to you
in the past.

826
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:17,111
No, don'’t mention it anymore.

827
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,636
Sometimes it takes
a good row to clear the air.

828
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,515
What are we going to
do about your father?

829
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,474
Believe me, it'’s
only because of you

830
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:35,651
that I haven'’t taken some
sort of legal action
against him.

831
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:37,566
And involve your
whole family in
a scandal?

832
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,960
That wouldn'’t
help anybody except
perhaps the journalists.

833
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,831
Just so long as he
leaves me alone,
that'’s all.

834
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,055
Good heavens,
what are we talking
about my father for?

835
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,144
Your new play
opens on Saturday.

836
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:51,885
We should be drinking
to its success.

837
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,105
Its success?

838
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:57,325
My dear boy,
you don'’t doubt it'll
be a success, do you?

839
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:01,982
To The Importance
of Being Earnest.

840
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,943
To the importance
of friendship.

841
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,280
-Wait there.
-Yes, sir.

842
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,286
Lord Queensberry, sir?

843
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:31,028
Yes.

844
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,117
I'’m sorry, sir, I've strict
instructions not to let you
into the theater.

845
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:37,686
You must be out of your senses.

846
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,557
I'’m sorry, sir.

847
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:41,299
Who the devil are you anyway?

848
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:42,648
I'’m a police officer, sir.

849
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:45,042
Are you indeed?

850
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,174
Police officer, are you?

851
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:49,089
Are you?

852
00:50:58,316 --> 00:51:00,057
Don'’t forget the cripple, sir.

853
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:02,798
I'’m sorry, sir.

854
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:04,713
No unauthorized persons
are permitted to enter
the theater.

855
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:06,585
Do you realize
who you'’re talking to?

856
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:08,717
Oh, I do indeed, Your Lordship.

857
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:10,763
Now look here, My Lord,
why don'’t you run along
and forget the whole thing?

858
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:13,200
You don'’t want to
go in there and spoil
everybody'’s enjoyment.

859
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:14,723
I'’m not
completely
without influence.

860
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,247
I'’m quite sure
you'’re not, My Lord.

861
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,771
No, I shall
report you to your
senior officer, sir.

862
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,432
Bit loose
in the upper story,
wouldn'’t you say, sir?

863
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:29,303
Hmm.

864
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:31,262
Well, let'’s hope that's
the last we'’ve seen
of him tonight.

865
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:51,891
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have enjoyed this
evening immensely.

866
00:51:53,849 --> 00:51:57,723
The actors have given
a charming rendering
of a delightful play.

867
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:05,426
And your appreciation
has been most intelligent.

868
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,344
I congratulate
you on the success
of your performance,

869
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:11,824
which proves to me

870
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:15,044
that you think
almost as highly
of the play as I do.

871
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:52,691
-That'’s quite a wit...
-Cab!

872
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,083
There'’s Queensberry.

873
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,259
Queensberry? What'’s he up to?

874
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:56,695
Mad as ever, I suppose.

875
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:00,916
Mad.

876
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:06,400
QUEENSBERRY:
Excuse me! Excuse me!

877
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:18,325
Mr. Wilde,
may I present
you with this, sir?

878
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,808
How charming.

879
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,593
Every time I smell them,
I shall think of you,
Lord Queensberry.

880
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,233
The Albemarle Club.

881
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,980
Hurry. Hurry!

882
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,174
Can I help you, sir?

883
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,263
Give me a pen.

884
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:29,527
Now, I want you

885
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,574
to give this message

886
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:37,186
to Mr. Oscar Wilde.

887
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,187
Very good, sir.

888
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,318
Here you are, Edward.

889
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:22,536
Thank you, Mr. Wilde, sir.

890
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,712
-Good morning, Wilde.
-Congratulations!

891
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,583
-Thank you.
-Cab!

892
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:34,853
Wilde, my dear fellow.

893
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:38,117
Saw your
play last night.
Laughed myself sick.

894
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,467
You seem to have made
a remarkable recovery, Major.

895
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:46,168
Oh, Mr. Wilde.
A gentleman left this
for you last night, sir.

896
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:48,562
-Oh.
-I hear your play
was a big success, sir.

897
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,347
Congratulations,
if I may say so.

898
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:51,217
Thank you, Sydney.

899
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:08,495
Hello, old chap.
Enjoyed your play...

900
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:19,245
Well, there'’s no doubt,
Mr. Wilde,

901
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,552
on the basis
of what is written
on this card alone,

902
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,510
you have the strongest
possible grounds

903
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:26,426
for an action against
Lord Queensberry for
criminal libel.

904
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,298
Does that mean,
Sir Edward, that
you will take the case?

905
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,213
Well, the question is,
of course,

906
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:32,824
do you want to proceed
with this action?

907
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:34,391
Well, of course!

908
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,002
Why do you ask that,
Sir Edward?

909
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:38,612
Well, no doubt,
Queensberry'’s defense

910
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,919
will be that the libelous
statement complained of

911
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:43,704
was justified
and in effect true.

912
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,619
It most certainly isn'’t true.

913
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:49,014
Nevertheless, the defense
will make every effort to
prove that it is,

914
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,451
and that could be extremely
embarrassing for Mr. Wilde.

915
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,453
I agree. Oscar,
it simply isn'’t worth it.

916
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,194
Queensberry'’s
obviously a lunatic.

917
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:57,544
To take
an action against him
is exactly what he wants.

918
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,459
That'’s why he left that card.

919
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,983
But if we let
him get away with this,
there'’ll be no holding him.

920
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:05,334
We have to
draw a line somewhere.
It'’s a matter of principle.

921
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,032
I'’m afraid Lord Alfred
is right.

922
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:09,077
The man must be
stopped somewhere.

923
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:10,949
Then you
wish to proceed
with this action?

924
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:13,473
I do.

925
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:16,171
Can'’t wait to see
my father'’s face when
I go into the witness box.

926
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:17,564
When I tell...

927
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,740
You'’re not going into
the witness box, Bosie.

928
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:22,656
Are you mad, Oscar?

929
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,223
I'’ve only got
to tell them
how he'’s...

930
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:26,007
How he'’s
persecuted me
these past two years,

931
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,879
how he drove my
mother out of the house
with his insane ravings.

932
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,098
I'’m not having
you involved, Bosie.

933
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,537
I'’m afraid, Mr. Wilde,
that Lord Alfred is
already involved.

934
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,321
Well, of course I'’m involved.

935
00:57:35,364 --> 00:57:37,802
I'’m not having
you exposed to more
scandal than is necessary.

936
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:39,586
Oscar, don'’t you realize...

937
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,719
Bosie, you'’re not going
into the witness box
and that is final.

938
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,694
You'’ll have
to forgive Bosie.
He'’s a little impulsive.

939
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:03,262
So it would seem.

940
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:05,786
Anyway, you have a very
strong case, Mr. Wilde.

941
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:08,354
What'’s the matter, Robbie?

942
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:12,271
Are you determined
to bring about your
own destruction, Oscar?

943
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:13,533
Is that what you'’re
trying to do?

944
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:14,882
I don'’t understand.

945
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:15,840
I used to think
you had a mind
of your own.

946
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,450
A great mind. Oh, really.

947
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,278
Oscar, you mustn'’t
let Bosie push you
into this thing.

948
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:20,975
-What'’s the alternative?
-Go abroad.

949
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:23,151
Let Queensberry
and his son fight
their quarrel without you.

950
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:24,283
They'’re well-matched.

951
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:27,068
It'’s too late, Robbie.

952
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:28,983
Well, Sir Edward,
I'’m entirely at
your disposal.

953
00:58:29,027 --> 00:58:30,550
Any further information
you need?

954
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,683
There is one question
I feel compelled to ask.

955
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:34,685
Please do.

956
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:37,122
I can only accept
this brief, Mr. Wilde,

957
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:40,081
if you assure
me on your honor as
an English gentleman

958
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,997
that there is no truth in
the charges made against you.

959
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,873
I assure you as
an Irish gentleman

960
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:52,050
that there'’s no truth
whatever in any of them.

961
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:54,531
Well, then, shall we say
here tomorrow morning
at 10:30, Mr. Wilde?

962
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:58,056
Good. Mr. Humphries.

963
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,978
Paper! Queensberry arrested!

964
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:10,111
Paper! Paper! Special edition!

965
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:11,635
Queensberry arrested!

966
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:14,289
Paper! Paper, sir! Paper!

967
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:36,573
COURT USHER: Silence!

968
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:04,731
That'’s Edward Carson,
defending Queensberry.

969
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,914
We went to
Trinity College together.

970
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:17,918
No doubt he'’ll perform
his task with all the added
bitterness of an old friend.

971
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,964
COURT USHER: Silence!

972
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,879

her crown and dignity,

999
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:34,794
"John Sholto Douglas,
Marquis of Queensberry,

1000
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:37,579
"upon the
aforesaid indictment,
how do you plead?"

1001
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,234
Guilty or not guilty?

1002
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:41,670
Not guilty, My Lord.

1003
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:44,195
If it please you, My Lord,

1004
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:46,980
it is my client'’s plea
that the alleged libel

1005
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:49,504
according to the natural
meaning of the words thereof

1006
01:02:49,548 --> 01:02:51,332
is true in substance
and in fact,

1007
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:54,205
and that it was for the
public benefit and interest

1008
01:02:54,248 --> 01:02:57,251
that the matter contained in
the alleged libel should
be published.

1009
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:00,254
Such a plea has been
filed with this court?

1010
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:01,560
It has, My Lord.

1011
01:03:01,603 --> 01:03:04,476
Thank you, Mr. Carson.
Let the jury be sworn.

1012
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:09,263
Take the Bible
in your right hand
and read from the card.

1013
01:03:09,307 --> 01:03:13,093
"I swear by Almighty God
that I will well and truly..."

1014
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,660
I put the card in an envelope,

1015
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:16,793
which I addressed
to Mr. Oscar Wilde

1016
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:18,925
and when Mr. Wilde
came into the club,

1017
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:22,711
I handed it to him saying that
Lord Queensberry had asked
me to give it to him.

1018
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,323
And did you look at this card
when Lord Queensberry
gave it to you?

1019
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,454
I did, sir.

1020
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:28,065
Thank you, Mr. Wright.

1021
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,111
I have no questions, My Lord.

1022
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:33,026
COURT USHER:
The witness may stand down.

1023
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:40,425
I don'’t think there's
any suggestion by the defense

1024
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:43,254
that Lord Queensberry did
not leave this card at
the Albemarle Club,

1025
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:46,039
nor that he wrote upon it
the words complained of
by my client.

1026
01:03:47,388 --> 01:03:49,347
In his plea of justification

1027
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:52,132
in which the defendant seeks
to malign the character
of Mr. Oscar Wilde,

1028
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:54,613
the defendant put
in evidence a letter

1029
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:57,877
written by
Mr. Oscar Wilde to
Lord Alfred Douglas,

1030
01:03:57,921 --> 01:03:59,661
the son of the accused.

1031
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:02,447
I now propose
to read the letter
to the court, My Lord.

1032
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,494
"My own boy, your
sonnet is quite lovely,

1033
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:10,150
"and it is a marvel that
those red rose leaf lips
of yours

1034
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:14,938
"should have been made
no less for music of song
than for madness of kisses.

1035
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:18,506
"Your slim guilt soul walks
between passion and poetry.

1036
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,509
"I know Hyacinthus,
whom Apollo loved
so madly,

1037
01:04:21,553 --> 01:04:23,555
"was you in Greek days.

1038
01:04:23,598 --> 01:04:27,167
"Always with undying love,
yours, Oscar."

1039
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:32,912
The words contained in that
letter may appear somewhat
extravagant

1040
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:36,655
for those normally
engaged in the writing of
commercial correspondence.

1041
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:39,136
Silence!

1042
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,312
But Mr. Wilde is a poet

1043
01:04:41,355 --> 01:04:44,881
and that letter
is considered by him
to be a prose sonnet,

1044
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:48,406
and one in which
he is no way ashamed.

1045
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:51,322
I now ask
Mr. Oscar Wilde to
go into the witness box.

1046
01:04:59,243 --> 01:05:02,986
Take the Bible
in your right hand
and read from the card.

1047
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:06,119
"I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give
to this court

1048
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:08,469
"shall be the
truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1049
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,557
"so help me God."

1050
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:17,696
You are Mr. Oscar Wilde and
you are the prosecutor in
this case.

1051
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:18,958
I am.

1052
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,481
How old are you, Mr. Wilde?

1053
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:22,048
I'’m 39.

1054
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:23,876
Are you married, Mr. Wilde?

1055
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,228
I am, and I have two children,
one aged nine and the other
eight.

1056
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:30,883
And when did you
first become acquainted
with Lord Alfred Douglas?

1057
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,974
In 1891.

1058
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,976
A friend
brought him to my house.

1059
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,631
And since that time you
have become close friends?

1060
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,938
He was a guest at
my house many times.

1061
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,375
A guest of yourself
and your wife?

1062
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:45,245
Certainly.

1063
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:49,858
In March 1893,

1064
01:05:49,902 --> 01:05:54,037
did it come to your notice
that a letter addressed by
you to Lord Alfred Douglas

1065
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,171
had come
into the hands of
a certain person?

1066
01:05:58,215 --> 01:06:00,608
Yes, a man named Wood
came to me

1067
01:06:00,652 --> 01:06:04,743
and said that he'’d found it in
a suit of clothes belonging to
Lord Alfred.

1068
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:06,658
Did he
demand money
for that letter?

1069
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:08,921
He said a man had
offered him £60
for it.

1070
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,401
And what did you say to that?

1071
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,490
I said
I'’d never received
so large an amount

1072
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,274
for a prose work
of that length,

1073
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:17,277
and I advised him to
sell it to the man
at once.

1074
01:06:20,585 --> 01:06:24,502
Prior to this time,
you had been subjected
to considerable annoyance

1075
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,112
by Lord Queensberry,
had you not?

1076
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,419
Oh, yes.

1077
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:30,856
He'’d written several
abusive letters to myself
and my friends

1078
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:33,511
and on one occasion,
he forced his way
into my house

1079
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:34,947
and I was compelled
to eject him.

1080
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,297
And what
took place on
that occasion?

1081
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:40,953
He made certain accusations
about my relationship
with Lord Alfred

1082
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,042
and I said to him,

1083
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:47,351
"Lord Queensberry, do you
seriously accuse your son
and me of improper conduct?"

1084
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:49,222
And what did he say to that?

1085
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:52,921
He said,
"I don'’t say you are,
but I say you look it."

1086
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,750
Silence in court!

1087
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:57,752
If there
is the slightest
disturbance again,

1088
01:06:57,796 --> 01:06:59,015
I shall have the court cleared.

1089
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:05,369
Mr. Wilde,
your attention has been
drawn to certain statements

1090
01:07:05,412 --> 01:07:07,371
made in the plea
of justification

1091
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,982
filed by
the defendant,
Lord Queensberry,

1092
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:14,378
with reference to different
persons impugning your
conduct with them.

1093
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:15,944
Yes.

1094
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:18,947
Mr. Wilde,

1095
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:23,039
is there any
truth whatever in any
of those accusations?

1096
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:24,779
None whatever in any of them.

1097
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:34,876
Thank you, Mr. Wilde.

1098
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:47,150
Mr. Wilde,
you stated earlier
that your age was 39.

1099
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,760
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

1100
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:56,811
You were born in 1854.
That makes you over
40, doesn'’t it?

1101
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:00,902
Oh, very well.

1102
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:04,036
Hmm.

1103
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,518
At what age was
Lord Alfred Douglas
when you first met him?

1104
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:09,433
He was between 20 and 21.

1105
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:11,609
Not yet 21. Hmm.

1106
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:16,483
And since that time you
have been close friends?

1107
01:08:17,354 --> 01:08:18,877
Yes.

1108
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,401
You'’ve stayed with
him at many places?

1109
01:08:22,446 --> 01:08:24,056
Yes.

1110
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:27,973
At Oxford, Brighton,
on several occasions?

1111
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:29,844
Yes.

1112
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:32,020
And at various
hotels in London?

1113
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,022
Yes.

1114
01:08:34,066 --> 01:08:36,503
You'’ve also been abroad
with him several times.

1115
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:40,377
Yes, to Egypt,
Paris and Monte Carlo.

1116
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,642
One could
therefore describe
your friendship as intimate?

1117
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:46,687
Yes, very.

1118
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:50,735
Indeed.

1119
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:54,695
I have
here a magazine
called The Chameleon,

1120
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,480
in which is
an article by yourself.

1121
01:08:56,523 --> 01:08:59,613
Also, two
poems contributed
by Lord Alfred Douglas.

1122
01:08:59,657 --> 01:09:01,528
Yes, I thought them
exceedingly beautiful.

1123
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:04,531
Did you?

1124
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,230
Do you remember
the titles of these
two poems, Mr. Wilde?

1125
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,536
Yes. One was called
In Praise of Shame,

1126
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,407
and the other, Two Loves.

1127
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,279
Thank you.

1128
01:09:13,323 --> 01:09:16,587
These two loves,
they were two boys,
weren'’t they?

1129
01:09:17,544 --> 01:09:18,371
Yes.

1130
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:26,553
One boy calls his love
true love and the other
boy calls his love shame.

1131
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:28,033
That is correct.

1132
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:32,385
Do you think that made
any improper suggestion?

1133
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:33,865
No, not at all.

1134
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:36,215
Hmm.

1135
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:41,960
There'’s another article
in this magazine

1136
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:45,398
entitled The Priest
and the Acolyte.
Have you read that?

1137
01:09:46,094 --> 01:09:47,879
I have.

1138
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:51,622
Did you consider
that this article
was in any way immoral?

1139
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,928
It was worse.
It was very badly written.

1140
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:59,847
Was it not the
story of a priest who fell
in love with an altar boy?

1141
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:02,546
Well, I read it only once
and nothing would induce
me to read it again.

1142
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:04,417
Do you think the
story blasphemous?

1143
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:07,464
I think
it violates every
artistic canon of beauty.

1144
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,117
That is not an answer.

1145
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:10,815
That'’s the only answer
I can give.

1146
01:10:10,858 --> 01:10:13,818
I wish to know
whether you thought
the story blasphemous?

1147
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:18,344
It disgusted me,
and the end was
completely wrong.

1148
01:10:18,388 --> 01:10:19,911
Will you answer the question?

1149
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:22,261
Did you or did you not
consider the story
blasphemous?

1150
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,003
I thought it was horrid.
Blasphemous is not
a word of mine.

1151
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:26,657
I see.

1152
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:32,402
Now, from the same
magazine here

1153
01:10:32,445 --> 01:10:37,233
are some of the phrases and
philosophies for the use
of the young

1154
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:39,278
which you contributed.

1155
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,541
"Wickedness is a myth
invented by good people

1156
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:44,327
"to account
for the curious
attractiveness of others."

1157
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,285
Do you think that true?

1158
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:48,766
I rarely think anything
I write is true.

1159
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:55,555
"Religions die hard when
they are proved to be true."

1160
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:56,991
Is that true?

1161
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,341
Yes, I hold to that,

1162
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:00,604
but it'’s too big
a question to go
into here.

1163
01:11:00,647 --> 01:11:02,475
Did you think
that was a safe axiom

1164
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:05,130
to put forward for the
philosophy of the young?

1165
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:07,480
I think it'’s most stimulating.

1166
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:11,092
"If one tells the truth, one
is sure sooner or later to
be found out."

1167
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,098
A pleasing paradox, but I do
not set very much store
on it as an axiom.

1168
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:19,318
Whether moral or immoral?

1169
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:22,843
There is no morality
or immorality in thought.

1170
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:24,889
There are immoral emotions.

1171
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:25,977
Quite so.

1172
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,286
Now then.

1173
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:34,638
This is the
introduction to your book,
The Picture of Dorian Gray.

1174
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:39,251
"There is no such thing
as a moral or immoral book.

1175
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,862
"Books are
well written
or badly written."

1176
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:43,516
That expresses your view?

1177
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,301
My view on art, yes.

1178
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:49,000
Then no matter how
immoral a book may be,
if it is well written,

1179
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:51,002
it is in your opinion
a good book.

1180
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:54,266
If it is well written so as
to produce a sense of beauty.

1181
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,833
Then a well written book

1182
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:59,184
putting forward perverted
moral views may be
a good book?

1183
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:01,534
A work
of art doesn'’t
put forward views.

1184
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:03,057
Views are for people.

1185
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:05,625
A perverted novel
might be a good book?

1186
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:08,019
I don'’t know
what you mean by
a perverted novel.

1187
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:10,195
Then, I will suggest
The Picture of Dorian Gray

1188
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,329
as being open
to the interpretation
of being such a book.

1189
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,374
Only to brutes and illiterates.

1190
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:19,726
The affection
and love of the artist
for the youth, Dorian Gray,

1191
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,207
might lead
an ordinary individual

1192
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,602
to believe
that it might have
a certain tendency.

1193
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:28,518
I have no knowledge
of the views of
ordinary individuals.

1194
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:30,781
Hmm.

1195
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:33,523
I propose, if I may, to quote

1196
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:36,569
a few passages from this book.

1197
01:12:36,613 --> 01:12:39,572
The artist Hallward is
speaking to Dorian Gray.

1198
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:42,227
"It is quite true
that I have worshiped you

1199
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:46,449
"with far more romance than
a man usually gives to
a friend.

1200
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:49,713
"I have never loved a woman.

1201
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:52,019
"From the moment I met you,

1202
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:55,327
"your personality had
the most extraordinary
influence over me.

1203
01:12:55,371 --> 01:13:02,116
"I quite admit I adored you
madly, extravagantly,
absurdly."

1204
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,075
Do you mean to
say that that passage

1205
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:07,818
describes the natural
feeling of one man
towards another?

1206
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:10,821
Dorian Gray'’s was
a remarkable personality.

1207
01:13:10,864 --> 01:13:15,695
May I take it that you as
an artist have never known
the feeling described here?

1208
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:18,437
No. It is a work of fiction.

1209
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:22,180
Let us go over it
phrase by phrase.

1210
01:13:22,223 --> 01:13:25,749
"I quite admit that I
have adored you madly."

1211
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:29,274
What do you say to that?
Have you ever adored
a young man madly?

1212
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:31,668
I'’ve never given
adoration to anyone.

1213
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,060
Except myself.

1214
01:13:36,237 --> 01:13:38,892
I suppose you think
that a very smart thing?

1215
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:39,763
Not at all.

1216
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,158
"I have adored
you extravagantly."

1217
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:46,247
Do you mean financially?

1218
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,728
Oh, yes, financially!

1219
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:51,035
Do you think that we
are talking about finance?

1220
01:13:51,078 --> 01:13:52,602
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

1221
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,430
Don'’t you?

1222
01:13:54,473 --> 01:13:56,693
Then I hope that I shall
make myself very plain
before I have done.

1223
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:04,004
And we come now
to the letter which you
wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas.

1224
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:08,748
It begins, "My own boy."

1225
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:12,578
Now, why should
a man of your age
address a young boy

1226
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:16,408
nearly 20
years younger
as "My own boy"?

1227
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,498
I was fond of him.
I'’ve always been
fond of him.

1228
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:20,978
Did you adore him?

1229
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:24,329
No, I like him.

1230
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:25,504
And that'’s not
an ordinary letter.

1231
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:27,114
You might as well
cross examine me

1232
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:29,595
as to whether a Shakespeare
sonnet was improper.

1233
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,033
Suppose a man
who was not an artist
had written this letter.

1234
01:14:33,077 --> 01:14:35,209
Would you say that
this was a proper letter?

1235
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:37,908
A man who was not an artist
wouldn'’t have written
that letter.

1236
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,388
Well, I can suggest, for
the sake of your reputation,

1237
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:43,043
that there'’s nothing
very wonderful in this.

1238
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:46,525
"Those red rose
leaf lips of yours..."

1239
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,527
It largely depends on
how it'’s read.

1240
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:55,229
"Your slim guilt soul walks
between passion and poetry."

1241
01:14:58,058 --> 01:15:00,713
Is that
a beautiful
phrase, Mr. Wilde?

1242
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:03,499
Not as you
read it, Mr. Carson.
You read it very badly.

1243
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:07,894
I do not profess
to be an artist,
Mr. Wilde.

1244
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:09,374
And when I hear
you give evidence,

1245
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:11,202
I'’m very glad that I am not.

1246
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:14,335
My Lord, I don'’t think my
learned friend should
talk like that.

1247
01:15:14,379 --> 01:15:15,989
May I suggest, Mr. Carson,

1248
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:19,993
that you do not air your
personal opinions in
this court?

1249
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:21,560
It is very difficult, My Lord.

1250
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:23,867
JUDGE: Yet nevertheless.

1251
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:28,480
Where did you first meet
the man Wood, Mr. Wilde?

1252
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:32,353
He came to my house.
I think it was in
January of 1893.

1253
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:35,226
And on the same evening,
you took him out to supper?

1254
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:37,402
Yes.

1255
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:40,318
Did you consider that
he'’d come to levy blackmail?

1256
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:42,581
I did, and I was
determined to face it.

1257
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,889
By taking
him out to supper
and giving him £40?

1258
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:48,152
Well, I saw that
the letter was
of no value,

1259
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:50,502
and I gave him
the money after he
told me a pitiful tale

1260
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,851
about being out of work.

1261
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:54,637
I suggest that you
had immoral relations

1262
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,421
with him first and
then gave him the money.

1263
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:58,162
My Lord, I really must protest

1264
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:00,033
at my learned friend'’s
method of questioning
the witness.

1265
01:16:00,077 --> 01:16:03,428
I do not see
that Mr. Carson is
in any way out of order.

1266
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:07,824
Thank you, My Lord.

1267
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:12,742
Do you know a man named
Charles Parker, Mr. Wilde?

1268
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:20,532
The witness will
answer the question.

1269
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:24,971
Yes, he was a friend
of Lord Alfred'’s.

1270
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,582
And a man named Atkin?

1271
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,672
Yes, he was a friend
of Parker'’s.

1272
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:32,196
A man named Grainger?

1273
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,851
Yes, he was
a manservant
of Lord Alfred'’s.

1274
01:16:34,894 --> 01:16:38,898
And Taylor, Mr. Wilde.
Do you know anyone
called Taylor?

1275
01:16:38,942 --> 01:16:41,640
Yes, I have been to parties
at his house. We...

1276
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:46,602
Were all these, with
the exception of Taylor,
young men of about 20?

1277
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:49,387
I like the society
of young men.

1278
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,781
Have you given money
to any of them?

1279
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,218
I may have.

1280
01:16:54,261 --> 01:16:55,088
Or presents?

1281
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:59,266
A silver cigarette case
for Mr. Taylor,

1282
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:03,488
gold-topped walking
stick for Mr. Parker,

1283
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:08,275
a book for
Mr. Wood inscribed,
"To Alfred from Oscar."

1284
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,585
Did you know, Mr. Wilde,

1285
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,196
that Wood had been
unemployed for three years,

1286
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,548
that Parker was a valet,
and that the man Taylor
was also out of work?

1287
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:22,681
That would
not have affected my
friendship with them.

1288
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:26,598
And yet you gave them presents
and entertained them to supper
on diverse occasions.

1289
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,992
No doubt you drank
wine and champagne.

1290
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:31,255
Iced champagne is
a favorite drink
of mine,

1291
01:17:31,298 --> 01:17:32,691
much against
my doctor'’s orders.

1292
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,258
Never mind
your doctor'’s orders.

1293
01:17:34,301 --> 01:17:35,172
I never do.

1294
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:39,916
And at these supper parties

1295
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:42,309
your guests no doubt
had plenty of champagne.

1296
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:43,528
I didn'’t press them to drink.

1297
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:44,877
You did not stint them?

1298
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:47,140
What gentleman
would stint his guests?

1299
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:50,709
What gentleman would stint
his valet and a groom,
Mr. Wilde?

1300
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:53,625
My Lord, I really must protest
at my learned friend'’s
sneering remarks.

1301
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:58,238
Mr. Carson, I suggest
you confine yourself to
questions, not opinions.

1302
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,676
Very well, My Lord.

1303
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:07,073
Did you know, Mr. Wilde,

1304
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,510
that Taylor, Atkin and Parker

1305
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:13,340
had been arrested in a raid
on a house in Fitzroy Square?

1306
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,299
Yes, I read about that.

1307
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:18,606
You know
that they were charged
with felonious practices?

1308
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:21,871
I understand
that the magistrate
dismissed the charge.

1309
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:24,874
About the young man Grainger.

1310
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,312
Have you ever dined with him?

1311
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:29,182
No, never.

1312
01:18:30,183 --> 01:18:32,098
But you know him?

1313
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:36,102
Yes, he was a manservant
at Lord Alfred'’s house
in Oxford.

1314
01:18:36,146 --> 01:18:37,887
So you saw him on
several occasions?

1315
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,889
I stayed in the house
on several occasions.

1316
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:40,977
Grainger waited at table.

1317
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:46,547
Did you ever kiss him,
Mr. Wilde?

1318
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,811
Oh, dear, no.
He was extremely ugly.

1319
01:19:00,431 --> 01:19:02,172
Is that the reason
you did not kiss him?

1320
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:04,957
Mr. Carson,
you are very insolent.

1321
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:07,090
Did you say that
you never kissed him?

1322
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:08,874
It'’s a foolish question.

1323
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:11,616
Then why, sir,
did you mention that
this boy was extremely ugly?

1324
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:13,313
I don'’t know
why I mentioned
that he was ugly

1325
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,054
except that
you stunned me with
your insolent remark

1326
01:19:15,098 --> 01:19:17,013
and the insulting way
you'’ve treated me
during this hearing.

1327
01:19:17,056 --> 01:19:19,102
Why did you mention
his ugliness?

1328
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:20,407
It was simply that I...

1329
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:21,844
Why? Why? Why?

1330
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:24,107
"I didn'’t
kiss Grainger
because he was ugly."

1331
01:19:24,150 --> 01:19:26,065
Quite untrue...
I protest, My Lord,
at his accusations.

1332
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:27,763
My learned friend
puts words into
the witness'’ mouth.

1333
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:29,721
The witness
is putting words
into his own mouth.

1334
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,984
-I object.
-I will not have this
brawling between counsels.

1335
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:33,943
If I may say so, My Lord,

1336
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,901
my learned friend has no right
to make suggestions of
a certain behavior

1337
01:19:35,945 --> 01:19:37,990
with a group of persons
not represented in
this court

1338
01:19:38,034 --> 01:19:39,383
and whose evidence
we have not heard.

1339
01:19:39,426 --> 01:19:41,298
But you will hear it,
Sir Edward.

1340
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:43,691
It is my intention
to produce every one of
the persons mentioned here

1341
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:46,216
just now in
this courtroom
tomorrow morning.

1342
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:48,566
Wood, Parker, Atkin,
Grainger and Taylor

1343
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:51,395
will relate
their loathsome experiences
at the hands of the witness.

1344
01:19:51,438 --> 01:19:54,050
By your own admission,
a group of blackmailers
and police suspects, sir.

1345
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:56,313
Nevertheless,
they'’ll be here
to give their testimony,

1346
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:59,620
testimony that will prove my
client'’s plea of justification

1347
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:01,579
beyond any possible shadow
of a doubt.

1348
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:04,582
Silence in court.

1349
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:07,890
I think this would be
an appropriate moment
to adjourn.

1350
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,543
The witness may stand down.

1351
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:18,335
The court
will reconvene at
10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1352
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,294
Be upstanding in court.

1353
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,472
All persons who have
anything further to do

1354
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:28,084
before My Lords,
the Queen'’s justices
of oyer and terminer...

1355
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:37,006
Before this unfortunate
trial started,

1356
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:39,138
you gave me your word that
there was no truth whatever

1357
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:41,445
in any of these
dreadful accusations.

1358
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:45,318
I know, Sir Edward. It was
unforgivably stupid of me,

1359
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:48,408
but I was afraid you
wouldn'’t take the case.

1360
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,325
As it is,
you realize you'’ve
already lost this case.

1361
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:55,154
But what is
infinitely more serious

1362
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:57,765
is that when Carson
puts these young men
into the witness box,

1363
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:00,203
as he obviously intends to do,

1364
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:03,206
their evidence
will inevitably result
in your being arrested

1365
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,904
on some extremely
grave charges.

1366
01:21:05,948 --> 01:21:08,341
Sir Edward,
may I just say one thing?

1367
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:10,387
Please do.

1368
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:14,217
The whole case started with my
father accusing Mr. Wilde
of carrying on an...

1369
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,697
An immoral relationship
with me, isn'’t that so?

1370
01:21:17,263 --> 01:21:18,961
Yes.

1371
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,658
Then why in heaven'’s name
can I not go into the
witness box

1372
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,660
-and deny this
disgusting accusation?
-Bosie, for the last time.

1373
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:24,227
-But it isn'’t true, Oscar.
-You know it isn'’t.

1374
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,837
Such a denial
would undoubtedly add

1375
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,926
considerable weight, Mr. Wilde.

1376
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:32,061
In my opinion, not to
put Lord Alfred into the
box would be a grave mistake.

1377
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:34,280
One that
you might regret for
the rest of your life.

1378
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:39,720
Gentlemen, I have infinite
faith in the good sense
of the common man,

1379
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:41,374
and if,
as you say,
this case hangs

1380
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:43,768
on the evidence
of paid informers

1381
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,683
and criminals
like Wood and Parker,

1382
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,904
I cannot conceive
that a British jury would
take their word before mine.

1383
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:51,341
I wish I could
share your faith.

1384
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:54,866
Well, what must be must be.

1385
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,607
But I want
you to understand
that Lord Alfred is not

1386
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:57,782
to give evidence at this trial.

1387
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:01,046
Very well.

1388
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:04,136
Well, I shall endeavor to
salvage what is left of
your reputation

1389
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,400
by withdrawing
from the case first thing
in the morning.

1390
01:22:07,444 --> 01:22:11,535
Incidentally, there'’s no need
for you to be present in
court tomorrow.

1391
01:22:11,578 --> 01:22:13,929
Indeed there'’s
no need for you to
be present in this country.

1392
01:22:16,366 --> 01:22:19,325
There is a boat train leaving
for Calais at 10:00 tonight,
Mr. Wilde.

1393
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:21,937
You'’d be well advised
to be on it.

1394
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:26,767
Before you condemn
Lord Queensberry,

1395
01:22:26,811 --> 01:22:29,857
I ask you to
consider whether the
gorge of any father ought

1396
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:32,164
not to rise in
such circumstances.

1397
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,993
I ask you to
bear in mind that
Lord Queensberry'’s son

1398
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:39,389
was so dominated by Wilde
that he threatened to
shoot his own father.

1399
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:43,219
I now have
a more painful part
of the case to approach.

1400
01:22:43,262 --> 01:22:45,177
It'’s my unhappy duty
to bring before you
young men...

1401
01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:48,006
-Did Wilde get away?
-No.

1402
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:50,704
...to tell their
miserable tales.

1403
01:22:50,748 --> 01:22:53,098
I first call Charles Parker.

1404
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,840
May I claim Your Lordship'’s
indulgence while I interpose

1405
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,624
to make a statement,
which is, of course,

1406
01:22:57,668 --> 01:22:59,757
made under a feeling
of great responsibility?

1407
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,020
By all means, Sir Edward.

1408
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,021
Forgive me, Mr. Carson.

1409
01:23:05,241 --> 01:23:06,807
I'’m sure it must be
apparent to Your Lordship

1410
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,636
that those
who represent
Mr. Wilde in this case

1411
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,857
have before them
a terrible anxiety.

1412
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,903
A verdict given in favor of
the defendant Lord Queensberry

1413
01:23:15,947 --> 01:23:20,343
might be interpreted
as conclusive proof as to
the accusations of impropriety

1414
01:23:20,386 --> 01:23:23,563
brought against the plaintiff,
Mr. Oscar Wilde

1415
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,565
and thus, we would be
going through,

1416
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:29,004
day after day,
an investigation of matters
of the most appalling nature.

1417
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:31,745
Under these circumstances,

1418
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:34,226
I feel I am
not going beyond
the bounds of my duty

1419
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:37,142
if I now interpose
and say on behalf
of Mr. Wilde

1420
01:23:37,186 --> 01:23:39,927
that I would ask to
withdraw from the prosecution.

1421
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:42,713
If that is your wish,
Sir Edward, so be it.

1422
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:43,975
COURT USHER: Silence.

1423
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,803
And if I may say so
in the circumstances,

1424
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:47,805
I think you have
made a wise decision.

1425
01:23:47,848 --> 01:23:49,589
Are you taking a cab?
Yes, come on.

1426
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:51,287
Get this
to the office
as soon as you can.

1427
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,811
"Oscar Wilde
withdraws from case."

1428
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:56,814
-Take a cab and hurry.
-Yes, sir.

1429
01:23:56,857 --> 01:24:02,298
Either the words
complained of were
justified or they were not.

1430
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:06,084
If they were,
then the statement,
"posing as a sodomite"

1431
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:10,001
is true
and the publication
was for the public benefit.

1432
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,308
You will now consider
your verdict.

1433
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:19,837
We'’ve already agreed
upon a verdict, My Lord.

1434
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:22,753
The prisoner will rise.

1435
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:28,585
Gentlemen of the jury,
do you find

1436
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:31,414
the plea
of justification
has been proved or not?

1437
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:32,850
We do.

1438
01:24:32,893 --> 01:24:35,592
And do you
find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?

1439
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:36,984
Not guilty, My Lord.

1440
01:24:38,508 --> 01:24:41,685
Silence in court!
Silence! Silence!

1441
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:43,904
Usher, silence the court.

1442
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:44,818
Usher!

1443
01:24:46,603 --> 01:24:48,257
Well, they haven'’t
wasted any time.

1444
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,649
Why, what do you mean?

1445
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:51,564
A copy
of the evidence
has already been sent

1446
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:52,870
to the Director of
Public Prosecutions.

1447
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,189
Bosie, for God'’s sake,
stop walking up and down.

1448
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,549
Oh.

1449
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,638
Oh, you haven'’t
eaten a thing, sir.

1450
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,249
I don'’t really want it.

1451
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:26,338
Thank you, Arthur.

1452
01:25:35,521 --> 01:25:38,394
Oscar, I'’ve just heard
from one of the reporters.

1453
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:39,960
There'’s a warrant
out for your arrest.

1454
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:43,964
What about Constance
and the children?

1455
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:47,054
I saw them off
on the train myself.

1456
01:25:49,056 --> 01:25:49,883
Thank you, Robbie.

1457
01:25:51,102 --> 01:25:52,408
Oscar, I beg of you.

1458
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:53,713
There'’s still time to
catch the 10:00 train.

1459
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:54,888
I have a cab waiting outside.

1460
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:57,021
You'’re wasting
your time, Robbie.

1461
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:59,284
I'’ve been trying
for the past two hours.

1462
01:25:59,328 --> 01:26:01,547
Oscar, will you
please listen to me?

1463
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:03,375
-It'’s too late.-It'’s not too late, I tell you.

1464
01:26:03,419 --> 01:26:05,334
-Look, it'’s 9:35.
-Oh, Robbie, have a drink.

1465
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:06,770
In three hours
we can be in France.

1466
01:26:06,813 --> 01:26:08,293
You look as if you need it.

1467
01:26:32,099 --> 01:26:34,363
-Mr. Wilde?
-Yes.

1468
01:26:34,406 --> 01:26:36,887
We'’re police officers.
We hold a warrant
for your arrest.

1469
01:26:38,105 --> 01:26:40,107
Really?

1470
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:42,414
I must ask
you to accompany us
to the police station.

1471
01:26:54,557 --> 01:26:57,037
Bosie, do something for me.

1472
01:26:57,908 --> 01:26:59,301
Anything.

1473
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:01,390
Leave the country.
If possible, tonight.

1474
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:04,697
-I can'’t desert you.
-Bosie, please.

1475
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:10,225
Very well.

1476
01:27:12,052 --> 01:27:13,793
So it'’s goodbye, hmm?

1477
01:27:13,837 --> 01:27:15,926
-Oscar, I can'’t believe...
-Goodbye.

1478
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:17,406
We'’ll come with you.

1479
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:19,495
-There'’ll be no need
for that, sir.
-Thank you.

1480
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:49,089
Why do you look
at me like that?

1481
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:51,309
It'’s not my fault.

1482
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,442
I loved him just as much
as you did.

1483
01:27:53,485 --> 01:27:55,270
Don'’t you think if there
was anything I could have...

1484
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:56,532
You can do as
Oscar says, Bosie.

1485
01:27:58,708 --> 01:27:59,796
Leave the country.

1486
01:28:04,627 --> 01:28:06,019
And the sooner the better,
I should say.

1487
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,834
"Lord Queensberry
is triumphant.

1488
01:28:37,877 --> 01:28:40,402
"Mr. Oscar Wilde is
damned and done forever."

1489
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:41,881
And about time.

1490
01:28:41,925 --> 01:28:43,666
-"Public morality
will be vindicated."
-Hear, hear.

1491
01:28:43,709 --> 01:28:47,626
"And this evil in our midst
will, I hope, be removed
forever."

1492
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:49,933
Damn good thing, too.
I never liked
the fellow from the first.

1493
01:28:49,976 --> 01:28:53,197
Couldn'’t stand his plays.
Lot of immoral rubbish.

1494
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,330
Damn it all, Bentley,
the fellow
hasn'’t been tried yet.

1495
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,462
Innocent until proved
guilty and all that
sort of...

1496
01:28:57,506 --> 01:28:58,985
If he'’d been in
my regiment, sir,

1497
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:01,118
he'’d have been lashed to
a gun carriage and flogged.

1498
01:29:01,161 --> 01:29:03,599
These artistic chaps
are all the same.

1499
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,470
A lot of long-haired
degenerates.

1500
01:29:05,514 --> 01:29:07,951
I think you fellows are
taking the whole damn
thing too seriously.

1501
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,692
Live and let live,
that'’s what I say.

1502
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:11,563
Anyway, I don'’t care
what they do

1503
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:13,565
as long as they don'’t do it
in the street and frighten
the horses.

1504
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:29,102
All right.

1505
01:29:35,326 --> 01:29:37,067
Do you want me to
burn them, Mr. Brace?

1506
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:40,113
Good heavens, no.
Fellow might get off.

1507
01:29:58,436 --> 01:29:59,394
Mr. Humphries.

1508
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,570
Sir Edward.

1509
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:04,834
I... They didn'’t
tell me that it was you.

1510
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:08,054
Mr. Wilde.

1511
01:30:10,492 --> 01:30:14,713
I don'’t know what
arrangements you'’ve
made about your defense,

1512
01:30:16,454 --> 01:30:18,108
but if you wish it,

1513
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:20,850
Sir Edward and I
would be most happy
to act on your behalf.

1514
01:30:22,504 --> 01:30:24,941
Thank you, I'’m...
I'’m very grateful.

1515
01:30:24,984 --> 01:30:27,378
There are certain legal
aspects of this case,
Mr. Wilde,

1516
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,293
that have shocked me greatly.

1517
01:30:29,336 --> 01:30:32,165
The prosecution
has based its entire case
on the evidence of witnesses

1518
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:38,694
who admitted crimes ranging
from assault, petty larceny
to blackmail.

1519
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:41,784
Yet the Crown has
no intention of prosecuting
any of these witnesses.

1520
01:30:41,827 --> 01:30:43,263
They are to go scot-free.

1521
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,484
Such a state
of affairs has
profoundly shaken

1522
01:30:46,528 --> 01:30:49,095
my inherent faith
in British justice.

1523
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:51,663
In these circumstances,
I would consider it an honor,

1524
01:30:51,707 --> 01:30:53,491
if you'’ll permit me
to offer my services.

1525
01:30:55,145 --> 01:30:57,060
Thank you.

1526
01:30:57,103 --> 01:31:00,237
I'’m afraid the cost
of the other case
is still unpaid,

1527
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,456
and I'’m in considerable debt.

1528
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:05,938
Mr. Wilde,

1529
01:31:05,982 --> 01:31:09,115
Sir Edward and I are
agreed that there is
no question of a fee.

1530
01:31:11,204 --> 01:31:12,031
Thank you.

1531
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,947
Thank you.

1532
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:17,341
Well, there are many matters
we should discuss, Mr. Wilde.

1533
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:26,176
CLERK: Put up Oscar
Fingal O'’Flahertie
Wills Wilde.

1534
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:28,831
Oscar Fingal O'’Flahertie
Wills Wilde.

1535
01:31:32,182 --> 01:31:34,924
COURT USHER:
Silence in court. Silence!
JUDGE: Order. Order.

1536
01:31:37,796 --> 01:31:40,886
CLERK:
Are you Oscar Fingal
O'’Flahertie Wills Wilde?

1537
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,105
I am.

1538
01:31:42,148 --> 01:31:43,933
Oscar Fingal O'’Flahertie
Wills Wilde,

1539
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:46,979
you stand charged on 25 counts.

1540
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:52,594
On the first count,
the jurors for Our Lady,
the Queen, upon their oath

1541
01:31:52,637 --> 01:31:56,293
present that Oscar Fingal
O'’Flahertie Wills Wilde,

1542
01:31:56,336 --> 01:32:00,732
on 14th day of March in
the year of Our Lord 1893,

1543
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:03,735
in the County of London
and within the jurisdiction
of this court,

1544
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:08,435
being a male person,
unlawfully did commit
acts of gross indecency

1545
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,744
with another male person,
one Alfred Wood.

1546
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:16,574
And against the form of the
statuette in such case
made and provided,

1547
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:18,663
and against the peace
of Our Lady the Queen,

1548
01:32:18,707 --> 01:32:20,012
her crown and dignity.

1549
01:32:21,884 --> 01:32:25,540
On the second count,
the juries aforesaid...

1550
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:29,848
...against the form of the
statute in such case
made and provided

1551
01:32:29,892 --> 01:32:34,723
and against the peace of
our said Lady the Queen,
her crown and dignity.

1552
01:32:36,638 --> 01:32:40,598
Oscar Fingal O'’Flahertie
Wills Wilde,

1553
01:32:40,642 --> 01:32:43,732
on the aforesaid indictments,
how do you plead?

1554
01:32:43,775 --> 01:32:45,211
Guilty or not guilty?

1555
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,084
Not guilty.

1556
01:32:50,434 --> 01:32:53,742
My Lord, gentlemen of the jury,

1557
01:32:53,785 --> 01:32:58,268
the first nine counts
in the indictment refer
to the prisoner'’s misconduct

1558
01:32:58,311 --> 01:33:01,532
with a young man
named Alfred Wood.

1559
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,969
The next three
to Frederick Atkin.

1560
01:33:04,013 --> 01:33:07,886
Two to the man Taylor.
Three to Charles Parker.

1561
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:11,542
And the last
to Wilde'’s conduct
with a lad named Shelley.

1562
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,371
It will
be shown that Wilde
systematically endeavored

1563
01:33:14,414 --> 01:33:17,592
to influence these young
men'’s minds towards
vicious causes.

1564
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:20,943
And to mold them to
his own depraved will.

1565
01:33:20,986 --> 01:33:24,468
Gentlemen of the jury,
when you have heard the
evidence of these men,

1566
01:33:24,511 --> 01:33:27,079
I assure you that
you will be justified

1567
01:33:27,123 --> 01:33:29,429
in finding the prisoner
guilty on all counts.

1568
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:31,170
I call first Alfred Wood.

1569
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,566
COURT USHER: Call Alfred Wood.

1570
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,872
Alfred Wood.

1571
01:33:48,927 --> 01:33:52,104
Take the Bible
in your right hand
and read from the card.

1572
01:33:52,148 --> 01:33:55,238
"I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I give
to this court

1573
01:33:55,281 --> 01:33:58,458
"shall be the truth,
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth,

1574
01:33:59,372 --> 01:34:00,460
"so help me, God."

1575
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:09,600
In all my years at the bar,
I cannot remember coming
face to face

1576
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,298
with such a miserable
collection of witnesses.

1577
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,999
Wood, Parker, Atkin.

1578
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:20,350
The prosecution
must have scraped

1579
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:23,048
the bottom of the barrel
to get that lot together.

1580
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:26,530
What I cannot understand
is how a man of Wilde'’s
taste and breeding

1581
01:34:26,573 --> 01:34:28,271
can come to associate
with such people.

1582
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:29,968
Well, to understand that,
Charles,

1583
01:34:30,012 --> 01:34:31,622
you'’d have to understand the
nature of Wilde'’s perversion.

1584
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,842
And I'’m a lawyer, not a doctor.

1585
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:37,149
To me, it'’s loathsome,
degenerate and unnatural.

1586
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,936
Yet I feel so sorry for him.

1587
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:44,896
It is a terrible thing,
Charles, when a man of
Wilde'’s talents and genius

1588
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:48,987
is slowly crucified by
a lot of blackmailers
and common criminals.

1589
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:54,732
There'’s very little hope
for an acquittal, is there?

1590
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:58,344
Well, the case
has already been judged
by the press and the public.

1591
01:34:58,388 --> 01:35:01,478
As far as
they'’re concerned,
Wilde is guilty.

1592
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:04,916
It only remains for him
to be sentenced.

1593
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,009
The most we can hope for is
that, out of this hysteria
of prejudice and hatred,

1594
01:35:11,053 --> 01:35:15,840
there might shine
a glimmer of Christian
charity and forgiveness.

1595
01:35:15,884 --> 01:35:17,973
Do I understand
you to say then,
Mr. Wilde,

1596
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,715
that there is no
truth whatsoever in the
evidence of Alfred Wood?

1597
01:35:21,933 --> 01:35:23,718
It'’s true
that we had
supper together,

1598
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:26,677
but the accusations of
impropriety are quite untrue.

1599
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,636
Charles Parker,
what part of his
evidence is untrue?

1600
01:35:31,247 --> 01:35:33,031
He never came
to the hotel with me.

1601
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:35,077
He never had dinner with me
and he never came to my room.

1602
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,865
We had tea
at the St. James'’s once,
but all of the rest...

1603
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:42,606
Is untrue.

1604
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:45,478
Then, Atkin.
What of his evidence?

1605
01:35:45,522 --> 01:35:47,611
My Lord,
my learned friend
seems to have forgotten

1606
01:35:47,654 --> 01:35:49,787
that the witness Atkin
perjured himself in
the box.

1607
01:35:49,831 --> 01:35:52,311
Your Lordship dismissed
this witness for that reason.

1608
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:55,358
The witness'’s evidence was
not struck from the record,
Sir Edward.

1609
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:57,882
In my humble submission,
My Lord, it should have been.

1610
01:35:57,926 --> 01:35:59,449
That is for me to decide.

1611
01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:03,888
As Your Lordship pleases.

1612
01:36:05,411 --> 01:36:08,763
What of Atkins'’
evidence, Mr. Wilde?

1613
01:36:08,806 --> 01:36:11,548
The accusations of indecency
are quite untrue.

1614
01:36:11,591 --> 01:36:15,770
In fact,
these witnesses,
according to you,

1615
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:17,772
have lied throughout the trial.

1616
01:36:17,815 --> 01:36:19,164
With remarkable ease.

1617
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,123
As an experienced
writer and storyteller,

1618
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:23,821
I'’m lost in admiration
of their inventiveness.

1619
01:36:25,867 --> 01:36:29,958
You seem also to have been
lost in admiration for
their youth, sir.

1620
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:31,524
I'’m a lover of youth.

1621
01:36:36,616 --> 01:36:39,968
Yes, we have gathered that.

1622
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:43,841
Now, let us turn to this
publication, The Chameleon.

1623
01:36:43,885 --> 01:36:46,278
My Lord,
are we to be subjected
to a further discourse

1624
01:36:46,322 --> 01:36:48,977
on the
literary morals
of the defendant?

1625
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,806
I understood from
my learned friend that
he'’s going to confine himself

1626
01:36:51,849 --> 01:36:53,851
to the specific charges
made in the indictment.

1627
01:36:53,895 --> 01:36:56,854
This is
cross examination
as to credit, My Lord.

1628
01:36:56,898 --> 01:37:00,249
I feel obliged to say that
questions which learned
counsel thinks

1629
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:02,381
should go to credit,
he is entitled to put.

1630
01:37:08,344 --> 01:37:11,042
I shall not keep you long,
Mr. Wilde.

1631
01:37:11,086 --> 01:37:13,305
I trust not, Mr. Gill.

1632
01:37:13,349 --> 01:37:15,786
In this magazine, to
which you made a contribution,

1633
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:18,571
there appears a poem
by Lord Alfred Douglas

1634
01:37:18,615 --> 01:37:21,487
entitled Two Loves.

1635
01:37:22,314 --> 01:37:24,186
It contains these lines.

1636
01:37:25,448 --> 01:37:27,493
"Sweet youth,

1637
01:37:27,537 --> 01:37:29,844
"tell me why, sad and sighing,

1638
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:32,759
"does thou rove
these pleasant realms?

1639
01:37:32,803 --> 01:37:36,024
"I pray,
tell me sooth.
What is thy name?

1640
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:40,419
"He said, '’My name is Love.'

1641
01:37:40,463 --> 01:37:43,205
"Then straight
the first did
turn himself to me

1642
01:37:43,248 --> 01:37:47,078
"and cried, '’He lieth,
for his name is Shame.

1643
01:37:47,122 --> 01:37:50,908
"'’But I am Love, and I was to
be alone in this fair garden,

1644
01:37:50,952 --> 01:37:53,302
"'’till he came
unasked by night.

1645
01:37:53,955 --> 01:37:55,957
"'’I am true Love.

1646
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,482
"'’I fill the hearts of boy
and girl with mutual flame.'’

1647
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,964
"Then, sighing, said the other,

1648
01:38:03,616 --> 01:38:05,662
"'’Have thy will,

1649
01:38:05,705 --> 01:38:10,406
"'’I am the love that
dare not speak its name.'’"

1650
01:38:13,322 --> 01:38:20,198
And what, Mr. Wilde,
is the love that dare
not speak its name?

1651
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:27,945
The love
that dare not speak
its name, in this century,

1652
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:31,601
is such a great affection
of an elder for a younger man.

1653
01:38:31,644 --> 01:38:34,734
As there was between
David and Jonathan.

1654
01:38:34,778 --> 01:38:37,433
Such as Plato made
the very basis of philosophy

1655
01:38:37,476 --> 01:38:40,915
and such as you will find in
the sonnets of Michelangelo
and Shakespeare.

1656
01:38:42,394 --> 01:38:46,877
It is a deep,
spiritual affection

1657
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,227
that is as perfect
as it is pure.

1658
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:54,537
It is in this
century misunderstood,
so much misunderstood

1659
01:38:54,580 --> 01:39:00,238
that it may
be called the love that
dare not speak its name.

1660
01:39:00,282 --> 01:39:03,241
And on account of it,
I'’m placed where I
am today.

1661
01:39:04,808 --> 01:39:06,244
But it is beautiful,

1662
01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:09,073
it is fine,

1663
01:39:09,117 --> 01:39:11,641
it is the noblest
form of affection.

1664
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:13,773
There is nothing
unnatural about it.

1665
01:39:14,774 --> 01:39:16,602
It is intellectual.

1666
01:39:16,646 --> 01:39:20,650
And is repeatedly to be
found between an elder
and a younger man

1667
01:39:20,693 --> 01:39:25,742
when the elder man has
intellect and the younger
man has all the hope and joy

1668
01:39:25,785 --> 01:39:27,918
and glamour of life before him.

1669
01:39:30,312 --> 01:39:32,836
But it is so the world
does not understand.

1670
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:36,579
The world mocks at it.

1671
01:39:36,622 --> 01:39:39,147
And sometimes puts
one in the pillory
for it.

1672
01:39:45,283 --> 01:39:46,719
COURT USHER: Silence in court.

1673
01:39:46,763 --> 01:39:47,720
Rubbish!

1674
01:39:47,764 --> 01:39:50,854
Silence in court!
Sit down, sir!

1675
01:39:50,897 --> 01:39:55,032
If there is the
slightest manifestation
of feeling like this again,

1676
01:39:55,076 --> 01:39:57,295
I shall have the court cleared.

1677
01:39:57,339 --> 01:40:00,472
I have no further
questions, My Lord.

1678
01:40:00,516 --> 01:40:02,083
JUDGE:
The witness
may stand down.

1679
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:10,439
That concludes the case
for the prosecution,
My Lord.

1680
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:27,412
May it
please you, My Lord,
gentlemen of the jury,

1681
01:40:27,456 --> 01:40:31,851
this is a serious
and grave question
for you to decide.

1682
01:40:31,895 --> 01:40:34,289
And yours is a position
of great responsibility.

1683
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,120
Now, a great deal of
public feeling has been
excited against Mr. Wilde

1684
01:40:39,163 --> 01:40:42,253
by the
quotation of passages
of poetry and literature

1685
01:40:42,297 --> 01:40:46,040
and in particular
from Mr. Wilde'’s book,
The Picture of Dorian Gray.

1686
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:48,129
Now I ask you,
members of the jury,

1687
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:52,437
is an author to be judged on
the morals of the characters
of his book?

1688
01:40:52,481 --> 01:40:55,614
Was Stevenson accused of
being a lustful and
depraved monster

1689
01:40:55,658 --> 01:40:58,748
because he wrote
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

1690
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:03,405
As to the affection which
Mr. Wilde expressed in
his letters,

1691
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:06,451
he himself
has described it as
pure, true affection,

1692
01:41:06,495 --> 01:41:09,411
absolutely unconnected with
and completely alien to the

1693
01:41:09,454 --> 01:41:12,109
filthy practices
described in this court

1694
01:41:12,153 --> 01:41:14,677
by the prosecution'’s
band of criminals.

1695
01:41:16,461 --> 01:41:19,160
Mr. Wilde is not
an ordinary man.

1696
01:41:19,203 --> 01:41:22,337
He is a man
who has written
poetry and prose,

1697
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,905
brilliant dramas,
charming essays.

1698
01:41:25,949 --> 01:41:28,691
He writes letters in
a tone which to most
of us may appear

1699
01:41:28,734 --> 01:41:34,479
high-flown, inflated,
exaggerated, even absurd.

1700
01:41:34,523 --> 01:41:38,483
But he'’s not ashamed
or afraid to produce
those letters.

1701
01:41:38,527 --> 01:41:41,573
When a man comes forward
with letters such as
these and says,

1702
01:41:41,617 --> 01:41:44,663
"I do not shrink
from the judgment of the
world upon these productions,"

1703
01:41:44,707 --> 01:41:48,928
has he not given the
best proof of his innocence?

1704
01:41:48,972 --> 01:41:51,757
Innocence,
gentlemen of the jury,
has courage and faith

1705
01:41:51,801 --> 01:41:53,890
in the ultimate
judgment of mankind.

1706
01:41:56,022 --> 01:42:00,418
As to the evidence
of the youths,
Parker, Atkin, Wood

1707
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:03,291
and their associates,

1708
01:42:03,334 --> 01:42:06,511
I respectfully submit that
no jury can find a man guilty

1709
01:42:06,555 --> 01:42:09,210
on their tainted evidence.

1710
01:42:09,253 --> 01:42:12,082
It deepens
one'’s horror to think
the prisoner'’s freedom

1711
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:13,866
is at the peril
of such persons.

1712
01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:19,220
Before you consider
this case, therefore,

1713
01:42:19,263 --> 01:42:24,007
I implore you to
let your judgment only be
affected by those witnesses

1714
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:27,010
of whom you,
as true and honorable men

1715
01:42:27,053 --> 01:42:29,143
can say, with a clear
conscience have given

1716
01:42:29,186 --> 01:42:33,408
true, honest and
honorable testimony.

1717
01:42:33,451 --> 01:42:36,802
And if, upon the examination
of the evidence, you find
it your duty to say

1718
01:42:36,846 --> 01:42:40,110
that the charges
against the prisoner
have not been proved,

1719
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:43,200
I know you'’ll be glad
that that bright reputation,

1720
01:42:43,244 --> 01:42:46,290
so nearly quenched
in a torrent of prejudice,

1721
01:42:46,334 --> 01:42:51,165
will have been saved by
your verdict from
absolute ruin.

1722
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:54,820
And that
it will leave Mr. Wilde,a distinguished man of letters,

1723
01:42:54,864 --> 01:42:57,388
to live a life
of honor and repute

1724
01:42:57,432 --> 01:43:01,218
and to give, in the
maturity of his genius,
gifts to our literature

1725
01:43:01,262 --> 01:43:04,178
of which, already,
he has shown such
brilliant promise.

1726
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:36,095
COURT USHER: Be
upstanding in court.

1727
01:44:48,717 --> 01:44:53,112
Gentlemen of the jury,
I understand that you are
unable to arrive at a verdict.

1728
01:44:53,156 --> 01:44:54,810
That is so, My Lord.

1729
01:44:54,853 --> 01:44:57,247
Is there any prospect
that if you retired

1730
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:59,597
and continued your
deliberations a little longer,

1731
01:44:59,641 --> 01:45:01,730
you'’ll be able to
come to some agreement?

1732
01:45:01,773 --> 01:45:04,341
We have considered
the question
for three hours, My Lord.

1733
01:45:04,385 --> 01:45:07,649
And the only
result we have come to
is that we cannot agree.

1734
01:45:07,692 --> 01:45:11,435
Yes, I have no doubt
that you have tried
very hard

1735
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:14,438
to come
to some agreement,
but on the other hand,

1736
01:45:14,482 --> 01:45:18,050
the inconveniences
of another trial
are very great.

1737
01:45:18,094 --> 01:45:21,010
My Lord, I fear there is
no chance of an agreement.

1738
01:45:21,053 --> 01:45:23,708
JUDGE:
Then, gentlemen,
you are discharged.

1739
01:45:23,752 --> 01:45:25,101
FOREMAN: Thank you, My Lord.

1740
01:45:25,144 --> 01:45:27,495
My Lord, on the
question of bail,

1741
01:45:27,538 --> 01:45:29,714
it may be some weeks
before a retrial...

1742
01:45:32,413 --> 01:45:38,636
Retrial!
Retrial! Retrial! Retrial!
Retrial! Retrial! Retrial!

1743
01:45:48,429 --> 01:45:50,300
Hello, Robbie.

1744
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,998
Mr. Wilde, we managed
to raise bail.

1745
01:45:53,042 --> 01:45:55,479
Come on, Oscar.
Let me take you home.

1746
01:45:55,523 --> 01:45:57,176
Who put up the money
for my bail?

1747
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:59,831
Bosie'’s brother Percy
put up most of the money.

1748
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:01,877
Percy? How kind.

1749
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,096
The rest was put up
by the Reverend Headlam.

1750
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:05,968
£5,000 in all.

1751
01:46:06,011 --> 01:46:09,406
It'’s preposterous.
A common felon would not
be so heavily penalized.

1752
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:11,800
The Reverend Headlam? Mmm-hmm.

1753
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:16,108
Extraordinary!
I hardly know him.

1754
01:46:37,086 --> 01:46:39,175
-Oscar, let'’s go to a hotel.
-No!

1755
01:46:46,225 --> 01:46:48,880
ARTHUR: Mr. Wilde!

1756
01:46:48,924 --> 01:46:53,755
Mr. Wilde.
Oh, sir, I'’ve done
everything I could.

1757
01:46:53,798 --> 01:46:57,236
Your manuscripts.
I'’ve managed to save
some of them,

1758
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:00,370
but they'’ve been going
through the house like
vultures, sir.

1759
01:47:02,154 --> 01:47:04,330
AUCTIONEER: £20! 25!

1760
01:47:04,374 --> 01:47:09,771
£25 I'’m bid for this priceless
first edition by Walt Whitman,
whoever he may be.

1761
01:47:09,814 --> 01:47:12,904
Now, now, come along,
gentlemen. Do I hear £30?

1762
01:47:12,948 --> 01:47:14,645
£30, 30. £35.

1763
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:17,561
£35, 35. Come along,
we haven'’t got all night.

1764
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:21,870
Going then at £30.
Going once, twice,
three times.

1765
01:47:21,913 --> 01:47:24,176
Charles, the gent
over there with the cigar.

1766
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:29,312
Now then.
Hello, hello, hello.
What have we got here?

1767
01:47:29,355 --> 01:47:32,924
A painting of
the dear boy himself.

1768
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:35,318
Very pretty, I'’m sure.
Very pretty.

1769
01:47:35,361 --> 01:47:39,627
Now what am I bid
for this masterpiece?
Do I hear 10 shillings?

1770
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:41,890
MAN: Ten shillings.
AUCTIONEER: Ten
shillings I'’m bid.

1771
01:47:41,933 --> 01:47:43,239
Do I hear a pound?

1772
01:47:43,282 --> 01:47:44,153
-£1.
-£1!

1773
01:47:44,196 --> 01:47:46,634
£1, 1.

1774
01:47:49,027 --> 01:47:53,554
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,
I think we have company.

1775
01:47:55,817 --> 01:47:59,473
Perhaps His Eminence will
bid for this artistic
painting.

1776
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:03,389
What about 30 bob, sir?

1777
01:48:04,608 --> 01:48:06,480
Come on, Oscar.
Haven'’t you seen enough?

1778
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:11,833
-No?

1779
01:48:11,876 --> 01:48:17,882
Well, all right, then.
Going at a pound.
Going, going...

1780
01:48:17,926 --> 01:48:19,188
40 guineas!

1781
01:48:19,231 --> 01:48:22,017
-AUCTIONEER: 40 guineas.

1782
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:24,976
Well, then.
Any advance
on 40 guineas?

1783
01:48:26,587 --> 01:48:29,459
All right. Sold to
His Lordship for
40 guineas.

1784
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,767
Charlie, give the
gentleman his painting.

1785
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,856
-40 guineas.
-Thank you, My Lord.

1786
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:36,945
-Thank you.
-What are you going to do
with it now you'’ve bought it?

1787
01:48:36,988 --> 01:48:38,381
Hang it in the bathroom!

1788
01:48:47,216 --> 01:48:50,393
Aw, blimey, governor.
What a waste of 40 quid.

1789
01:48:50,436 --> 01:48:53,396
MAN:
I say, a little
bit rash, what?

1790
01:48:56,573 --> 01:48:57,618
I feel like a drink.

1791
01:49:01,926 --> 01:49:03,188
Excuse me, please.

1792
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:07,323
Excuse me. Thank you.
Excuse me, madam.

1793
01:49:08,367 --> 01:49:10,021
Excuse me. Thank you.

1794
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:12,502
Excuse me.

1795
01:49:15,897 --> 01:49:17,115
Come on, Oscar.

1796
01:49:19,378 --> 01:49:21,859
AUCTIONEER: Well,
we weren'’t very
quick there.

1797
01:49:21,903 --> 01:49:25,471
We should have
asked His Eminence to
autograph a few books, eh?

1798
01:49:27,386 --> 01:49:30,825
Now then,
an original manuscript
of that uproarious comedy,

1799
01:49:30,868 --> 01:49:33,654
The Importance
of Being Earnestby
the late Oscar Wilde.

1800
01:49:33,697 --> 01:49:35,481
-Now, then, do I hear £10?

1801
01:49:58,766 --> 01:49:59,984
Mr. Wilde.

1802
01:50:01,812 --> 01:50:03,597
I'’m most dreadfully
sorry about this, sir,

1803
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:05,990
but I'’m afraid
we must ask you to leave.

1804
01:50:06,034 --> 01:50:07,818
Ask us to leave?
But how dare you
come up...

1805
01:50:07,862 --> 01:50:09,646
-I'’m very sorry, sir.
-Don'’t you realize
that Mr. Wilde'’s...

1806
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:10,908
It'’s all right, Robbie.

1807
01:50:10,952 --> 01:50:11,953
Let'’s go.

1808
01:50:19,482 --> 01:50:21,745
Remarkable, the sort
of people they allow
in here these days!

1809
01:50:21,789 --> 01:50:23,921
-I thought it was
a high-class place!

1810
01:50:23,965 --> 01:50:26,054
I think it'’s
blooming disgusting.

1811
01:50:26,097 --> 01:50:28,709
Come on, my friends, drink up.
Pay the bill, will you,
Freddie?

1812
01:50:28,752 --> 01:50:30,014
Why, certainly, Q.

1813
01:50:30,058 --> 01:50:31,189
Cab!

1814
01:50:31,233 --> 01:50:33,191
God bless you, Mr. Wilde.

1815
01:50:34,192 --> 01:50:35,193
Hello, Amy.

1816
01:50:36,847 --> 01:50:38,196
Knightsbridge, cabby.

1817
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,067
Yes, sir.

1818
01:50:42,897 --> 01:50:44,899
MAN 1: Blimey! It'’s raining!

1819
01:50:44,942 --> 01:50:46,248
QUEENSBERRY: Get my carriage.

1820
01:50:46,291 --> 01:50:47,466
So long, Oscar!

1821
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:48,772
Are we going to have
a bit of sport then?

1822
01:50:48,816 --> 01:50:50,078
Yes, I think so.

1823
01:50:50,121 --> 01:50:52,471
MAN 2: Come on, there we go,
let'’s get in.

1824
01:50:53,037 --> 01:50:54,125
Come on.

1825
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,433
Follow him. As fast as you can.

1826
01:50:57,476 --> 01:50:58,782
MAN 2: Tallyho!

1827
01:51:06,877 --> 01:51:09,575
By God,
they'’re following us.
The man must be mad.

1828
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:11,534
I should have thought it
was common knowledge
by now, Robbie.

1829
01:51:11,577 --> 01:51:12,709
Go faster, driver!

1830
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:17,845
MAN 2: Tallyho!

1831
01:51:20,586 --> 01:51:22,763
Faster, driver, faster!

1832
01:51:22,806 --> 01:51:24,155
MAN 2: Tallyho!

1833
01:51:27,724 --> 01:51:30,553
This is madness.
I'’m going to walk.
Stop the cab, driver!

1834
01:51:30,596 --> 01:51:31,902
Oscar, don'’t be foolish.

1835
01:51:31,946 --> 01:51:32,903
I'’m not
going to put you
through all this.

1836
01:51:37,778 --> 01:51:39,301
Oscar, where will you be?

1837
01:51:39,344 --> 01:51:40,606
-I'’m going to my mother.
-Right.

1838
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:41,999
Carry on, driver.

1839
01:52:18,819 --> 01:52:20,821
Well, now,
my old darling,
where'’s your friend?

1840
01:52:20,864 --> 01:52:22,344
Why are you doing this,
Queensberry?

1841
01:52:22,387 --> 01:52:23,954
Why are you hounding
this man in this way?

1842
01:52:23,998 --> 01:52:26,870
Haven'’t you had
your pound of flesh?

1843
01:52:26,914 --> 01:52:28,916
You don'’t know me
very well, do you,
Mr. Ross?

1844
01:52:28,959 --> 01:52:30,352
I'’m not so easily satisfied.

1845
01:52:30,395 --> 01:52:31,483
That'’s quite evident.

1846
01:52:31,527 --> 01:52:33,268
Tell Wilde that
I shall not be happy

1847
01:52:33,311 --> 01:52:35,096
until I see him
under six feet
of earth.

1848
01:52:35,139 --> 01:52:36,619
Six feet of earth,
Lord Queensberry,

1849
01:52:36,662 --> 01:52:38,708
puts us all very much
on the same level.

1850
01:52:40,666 --> 01:52:42,973
I'’ve not finished with him yet!

1851
01:52:43,017 --> 01:52:45,019
I shall hound him
until his dying day!

1852
01:52:46,977 --> 01:52:49,197
Until his dying day!

1853
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:51,460
Well, what now, Q?
Is the hunt still on?

1854
01:52:52,548 --> 01:52:53,767
Let'’s go to The Savoy.

1855
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,681
Ah, let'’s go to The Savoy.
Go to The Savoy.

1856
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:05,953
Oscar!

1857
01:53:06,605 --> 01:53:08,520
Oscar, is that you?

1858
01:53:10,044 --> 01:53:11,088
Willie!

1859
01:53:11,132 --> 01:53:15,092
Dear darling Mother.
Yes, what is it?

1860
01:53:15,136 --> 01:53:18,530
Dearest Mother,
you know you should
have been an actress.

1861
01:53:18,574 --> 01:53:21,142
I doubt if the great
Sarah Bernhardt herself

1862
01:53:21,185 --> 01:53:24,101
made a more imposing
Lady Macbeth.

1863
01:53:24,145 --> 01:53:27,365
But aren'’t you just
a little premature
to wear mourning?

1864
01:53:28,889 --> 01:53:31,979
Oscar isn'’t quite
dead yet, you know.

1865
01:53:32,022 --> 01:53:33,589
They crucified him.

1866
01:53:33,632 --> 01:53:35,460
Now, Mother,
if you'’re going to
go on like this, I...

1867
01:53:48,691 --> 01:53:49,910
Who'’s there?

1868
01:53:49,953 --> 01:53:51,694
OSCAR: Willie, let me in,
for God'’s sake.

1869
01:53:58,048 --> 01:54:00,659
Willie, let me stay.
Let me stay.

1870
01:54:01,573 --> 01:54:03,140
Or I shall die on the streets.

1871
01:54:09,233 --> 01:54:10,278
Are you drunk?

1872
01:54:19,374 --> 01:54:20,549
Here you are.

1873
01:54:21,158 --> 01:54:24,335
Is this my son?

1874
01:54:24,379 --> 01:54:28,687
Is this Oscar Wilde,
cringing in the dark
like a frightened animal?

1875
01:54:28,731 --> 01:54:30,385
Mother, for heaven'’s sake!

1876
01:54:30,428 --> 01:54:31,995
Stand up, sir.

1877
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:33,779
Stand up and face them, sir!

1878
01:54:35,607 --> 01:54:36,870
For God'’s sake,
don'’t let them in, Willie.

1879
01:54:38,959 --> 01:54:41,396
Willie, open the door.

1880
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:43,354
My son is ready for them.

1881
01:54:50,796 --> 01:54:52,886
Robbie. Thank God you'’ve come.

1882
01:54:56,933 --> 01:54:58,761
Ada.

1883
01:54:58,804 --> 01:55:00,763
-Robbie, what'’s
to become of me?
-It'’s all right.

1884
01:55:00,806 --> 01:55:03,461
Couldn'’t you have
taken his coat off?
He'’s soaked to the skin.

1885
01:55:04,462 --> 01:55:05,942
He'’s ill. He should be in bed.

1886
01:55:05,986 --> 01:55:08,858
But he... He can'’t
stay here, you know.
Well...

1887
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,947
I mean,
it would be awkward,
you see.

1888
01:55:10,991 --> 01:55:12,949
There'’s been mobs hanging
about in the street all day,

1889
01:55:12,993 --> 01:55:14,908
and if they were to
find out he was here,

1890
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:17,040
well, there'’s no
knowing what they'’d do.

1891
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:19,738
My son is not afraid of them!

1892
01:55:19,782 --> 01:55:22,350
He'’ll stand up and face them

1893
01:55:22,393 --> 01:55:24,569
like a true Irish gentleman.

1894
01:55:24,613 --> 01:55:27,833
I can find him a bed
at my house. Come, Oscar.

1895
01:55:27,877 --> 01:55:31,228
Don'’t sit up too late, my son.

1896
01:55:31,272 --> 01:55:34,231
You need all the sleep
you can get

1897
01:55:34,275 --> 01:55:37,539
in this terrible time
we'’re all passing through.

1898
01:55:39,584 --> 01:55:41,412
Come on, Oscar.

1899
01:55:41,456 --> 01:55:43,719
I'’m not thinking of
myself, you understand.

1900
01:55:43,762 --> 01:55:46,200
He is my brother.
But it'’s my mother.

1901
01:55:46,243 --> 01:55:48,680
She'’s not very well and
any sudden shock might...

1902
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,040
The prisoner will rise.

1903
01:56:02,564 --> 01:56:06,089
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you agreed upon
a verdict?

1904
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:07,786
We have.

1905
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:11,486
Do you find the
prisoner at the bar
guilty or not guilty?

1906
01:56:12,443 --> 01:56:13,705
Guilty, My Lord.

1907
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:16,882
COURT USHER: Silence in court!

1908
01:56:16,926 --> 01:56:19,494
And is that
the verdict of you all?

1909
01:56:19,537 --> 01:56:21,322
Yes. Guilty.

1910
01:56:23,802 --> 01:56:26,022
COURT USHER: Silence!

1911
01:56:26,066 --> 01:56:30,722
Oscar Wilde,
the crime for which
you have been convicted

1912
01:56:30,766 --> 01:56:37,077
is so bad that one has to
put a stern restraint
upon one'’s self

1913
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:42,908
to avoid describing,
in language I would
rather not use,

1914
01:56:42,952 --> 01:56:47,130
the sentiments that must
rise in the breasts of
every man of honor

1915
01:56:47,174 --> 01:56:51,439
who has listened
to the details of
these terrible trials.

1916
01:56:51,482 --> 01:56:55,138
That you have been
the center of a circle

1917
01:56:55,182 --> 01:56:58,446
of the most terrible
corruption among young men,

1918
01:56:58,489 --> 01:57:01,753
it is impossible to doubt.

1919
01:57:01,797 --> 01:57:06,932
And under the circumstances,
I shall pass the severest
sentence the law allows.

1920
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:10,719
Although, in my judgment

1921
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:14,157
it is totally inadequate
for a case of this sort.

1922
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,249
Sentence of the court is
that you go to imprisonment

1923
01:57:19,293 --> 01:57:22,687
and be kept
to hard labor
for two years.

1924
01:57:24,341 --> 01:57:25,299
COURT USHER: Silence!

1925
01:57:29,564 --> 01:57:31,305
Be upstanding in court.

1926
01:57:33,524 --> 01:57:37,180
All persons having
anything further to
do before My Lords...

1927
01:57:37,224 --> 01:57:39,791
Come on, back! Back.
Come on, back!

1928
01:57:52,543 --> 01:57:54,806
He'’ll get his hair cut now,
won'’t he?

1929
01:58:46,206 --> 01:58:51,428
OSCAR: "I never saw sad men
who looked with such
a wistful eye

1930
01:58:51,472 --> 01:58:57,260
"upon that
little tent of blue
we prisoners call the sky,

1931
01:58:57,304 --> 01:59:02,352
"and at every happy cloud that
passed in such strange
fre edom by."

1932
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:25,914
My dearest, your hands.

1933
02:00:28,569 --> 02:00:32,181
I'’ve
never been so idle
and worked so hard.

1934
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:38,187
Please, my dear,
we have so little time.

1935
02:00:39,928 --> 02:00:42,713
Oh, Constance,
I'’ve waited all these
months for you to come.

1936
02:00:44,149 --> 02:00:47,196
I would'’ve come
before, Oscar, only...

1937
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,590
I don'’t know, it's all been
so confusing.

1938
02:00:51,418 --> 02:00:52,593
Why have you come now?

1939
02:00:54,116 --> 02:00:55,900
I have some bad news
for you, Oscar.

1940
02:00:55,944 --> 02:00:58,120
I didn'’t want you to hear it
from anyone else.

1941
02:01:00,949 --> 02:01:02,080
Your mother...

1942
02:01:03,778 --> 02:01:04,692
She'’s dead, Oscar.

1943
02:01:07,347 --> 02:01:09,784
There was no pain.
She passed away
in her sleep.

1944
02:01:14,092 --> 02:01:16,356
I wish I could
leave here in that way.

1945
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:18,706
No, Oscar,
you mustn'’t say that.
You must be patient.

1946
02:01:18,749 --> 02:01:21,186
It'’s not patience that's
needed here, it'’s apathy.

1947
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:25,234
And apathy is the
most pitiful of vices.

1948
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:28,455
Constance, I don'’t
think I can survive
another year of this.

1949
02:01:28,498 --> 02:01:31,066
Oh, my dear.
It'’s only the thought
of the children

1950
02:01:31,109 --> 02:01:33,895
that keeps me alive in
these terrible months
of waiting.

1951
02:01:35,810 --> 02:01:36,898
How are they?

1952
02:01:41,729 --> 02:01:42,643
They'’re well.

1953
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,648
It'’ll be
Vyvyan'’s birthday soon.

1954
02:01:47,691 --> 02:01:51,042
-Oscar, I...
-Is he 9 or 10?

1955
02:01:51,086 --> 02:01:53,131
The time passes so slowly.

1956
02:01:53,175 --> 02:01:56,047
Oscar, I cannot
allow you to see
the children again.

1957
02:02:05,230 --> 02:02:07,320
I'’m only trying to do
what I think is right.

1958
02:02:07,363 --> 02:02:09,409
I'’ve thought and thought
about it and I...

1959
02:02:17,634 --> 02:02:19,070
Forgive me, my dearest.

1960
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:23,336
Please. Forgive me.

1961
02:02:31,082 --> 02:02:32,257
Oscar.

1962
02:02:39,613 --> 02:02:40,918
I brought you some cigarettes

1963
02:02:42,050 --> 02:02:43,878
and some delicacies,
some chicken.

1964
02:02:43,921 --> 02:02:45,749
I know what the food
must be like.

1965
02:02:53,975 --> 02:02:54,845
Goodbye, my dear.

1966
02:03:44,547 --> 02:03:46,810
Will he have time to catch
the boat train?

1967
02:03:46,854 --> 02:03:48,116
If we hurry.

1968
02:03:55,079 --> 02:03:56,646
Goodbye, Mr. Wilde, sir.

1969
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:58,909
Goodbye, Dick. Thank you.

1970
02:04:16,492 --> 02:04:17,624
Thank you, my dear.

1971
02:04:20,714 --> 02:04:22,106
Oscar.

1972
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:23,238
Come on, we must hurry.

1973
02:04:37,165 --> 02:04:38,601
You look well, Oscar.

1974
02:04:44,302 --> 02:04:45,956
The children send their love.

1975
02:04:47,523 --> 02:04:48,481
Thank you.

1976
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:53,137
I told them
you were very ill.
I hope you understand.

1977
02:04:55,313 --> 02:04:56,619
Yes, of course.

1978
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:02,320
Well, I suppose
we'’d better get
down to business.

1979
02:05:02,364 --> 02:05:03,539
There isn'’t very much time.

1980
02:05:06,368 --> 02:05:12,592
I'’ve arranged
with my lawyer to
pay you £150 a year.

1981
02:05:12,635 --> 02:05:15,203
It'’s not much, I'm afraid,
but it'’s all I can afford.

1982
02:05:16,596 --> 02:05:18,511
I am very grateful
to you, Constance.

1983
02:05:20,469 --> 02:05:22,732
Only I'’m sorry I had
to make one condition.

1984
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:29,391
If you see or communicate with
Bosie again, the payments
will stop.

1985
02:05:34,701 --> 02:05:37,268
Yes, I... I understand.

1986
02:05:37,312 --> 02:05:38,748
I know that may sound harsh,

1987
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:41,011
but I promise you
I'’m doing it to help you.

1988
02:05:43,927 --> 02:05:44,754
Hmm.

1989
02:06:07,864 --> 02:06:08,735
Porter.

1990
02:06:12,826 --> 02:06:14,044
-Boat train, sir?
-Yes.

1991
02:06:26,666 --> 02:06:27,623
Ada.

1992
02:06:29,059 --> 02:06:31,235
You look lovelier than ever.

1993
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:33,150
Oh, it'’s good
to see you, Oscar.

1994
02:06:36,676 --> 02:06:37,720
Ticket, madam?

1995
02:06:37,764 --> 02:06:39,113
The gentleman has them.
Thank you.

1996
02:06:41,724 --> 02:06:44,074
Oh, Robbie,
I can'’t bear to
see him looking so ill.

1997
02:06:44,118 --> 02:06:46,120
I was talking to the
prison doctor yesterday.

1998
02:06:46,163 --> 02:06:48,601
Another six months in there
and he'’d never come out alive.

1999
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:55,564
Constance.

2000
02:06:56,783 --> 02:06:58,523
I want you to remember this.

2001
02:06:59,742 --> 02:07:02,092
I have always loved you,
and I always will.

2002
02:07:04,529 --> 02:07:08,316
You talk as if...
You'’re going to get well again

2003
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:10,927
and you'’ll forget
about these past two years.

2004
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:14,191
You'’ll start work again.

2005
02:07:14,235 --> 02:07:16,977
I know you too well, Oscar.
Once you start writing, you...

2006
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:26,682
Ada, don'’t be so depressed
on my behalf.

2007
02:07:26,726 --> 02:07:30,773
What better reward
for one'’s sins than
to be exiled to Paris?

2008
02:07:30,817 --> 02:07:34,908
Where no doubt
I shall die as I have lived,
beyond my means.

2009
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,606
What a gorgeous hat.

2010
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,651
Oh, Oscar.

2011
02:07:40,696 --> 02:07:42,306
Goodbye, my dear.

2012
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:43,917
Take care of the children.

2013
02:07:56,973 --> 02:07:58,061
Hello, Oscar.

2014
02:08:47,632 --> 02:08:49,156
I never understood it, Ada.

2015
02:08:50,505 --> 02:08:51,898
I just never understood it.

2016
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:59,296
OSCAR: "Yet each man
kills the thing he loves.

2017
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,429
"By each let this be heard.

2018
02:09:01,472 --> 02:09:03,474
"Some do it with a bitter look,

2019
02:09:03,518 --> 02:09:05,694
"some with a flattering word.

2020
02:09:06,695 --> 02:09:09,002
"A coward does it with a kiss,

2021
02:09:09,045 --> 02:09:11,439
"the brave man with a sword."
