00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,343
for a prose work
of that length.

307
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,824
You take the letter, sir.

308
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,044
It was stupid of me
to try and rent you.

309
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,916
The thing is, sir,
that I'’m desperate
for money and...

310
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,223
A hungry man gets
driven to do stupid things.

311
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,051
Oh, would you like
a ham sandwich?

312
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,400
Now you'’re making
fun of me, sir.

313
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,054
[LAUGHS] On the
contrary, Mr. Wood.

314
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,448
You'’re doing
remarkably well yourself.

315
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,971
Well, I think I'’ll
be going now, sir.

316
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,800
No, no, no, no.
Please stay and
finish your drink.

317
00:16:58,843 --> 00:16:59,844
That'’s very kind of you.

318
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,022
[CHUCKLES]

319
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:07,156
You'’re a very poor criminal,
Mr. Wood, if I may say so.

320
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,205
The fact is
I came to London
to look for some work.

321
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,773
Ah, work, Mr. Wood, is the
curse of the drinking classes.

322
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,079
[LAUGHS]

323
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,083
The secret of maintaining youth

324
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:27,611
is an inordinate
passion for pleasure.

325
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,490
L40, sir?

326
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,580
I'’m going
out to dine in a moment.
Perhaps you'’d care to join me.

327
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,886
Well, that'’s very kind
of you, sir.

328
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,410
There'’s a fascinating charm

329
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:47,283
about your halfhearted
criminal tendencies,
Mr. Wood.

330
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:51,374
I suspect that you lead
a wonderfully wicked life.

331
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,681
Ah, well,
there'’s good and
bad in all of us, sir.

332
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,422
Mr. Wood, you'’re
a born philosopher.

333
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,206
I'’m sure we shall
get along extremely well.

334
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,077
Your health, sir.

335
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,652
[CLOCK CHIMING]

336
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,704
Shall I serve dinner, madam?

337
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,229
I can'’t understand it.
I'’m sure Mr. Wilde said

338
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,013
he would be in for dinner.

339
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:24,973
Well, perhaps
he'’s been detained
on business, madam.

340
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,235
Yes.

341
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,106
Shall we wait?

342
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,718
No, Arthur, I'’ll dine alone.

343
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:31,588
Very well, madam.

344
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,008
Bosie, you'’re
nearly an hour late.

345
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,878
Yes, I know.

346
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,707
Oh, I know what
that face means.

347
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,275
It usually heralds
an unpleasant scene.

348
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,147
It would be nice
if it could be avoided.

349
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,018
I'’m in a singularly good mood.

350
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,281
Are you?
- I was.

351
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,066
No doubt, having
entertained your friend
at the Savoy last night.

352
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,765
You mean Mr. Wood?

353
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,202
Really, Oscar, have
you no sense of propriety?

354
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,421
The man is a valet.

355
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,684
A very amusing valet.

356
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:27,731
Thank heavens, Bosie,
I am not inhibited
by your sense of class.

357
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,472
[SCOFFS] So it seems.

358
00:19:29,516 --> 00:19:30,952
Anyway, he was your friend.

359
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,694
I hardly knew the man.

360
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,609
That'’s not the impression
that he gave to me.

361
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,132
WAITER: Good morning, My Lord.

362
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,829
What did he want anyway?

363
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,831
Money. What do
the poor usually want?

364
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,355
Would you like to
order now, My Lord?

365
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,530
And you gave it to him?

366
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:47,360
For a valuable
piece of property.

367
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,753
A letter I wrote you at Oxford.

368
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,451
WAITER: May I recommend
the lobster, My Lord?

369
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,019
I'’ll have the sole meuniere.
- Very good.

370
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:58,632
Do you mean he blackmailed you?

371
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:02,723
Leaving that letter
around for anyone to find
was not only careless of you,

372
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,812
but singularly
lacking in respect

373
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,076
for something
that I'’d hoped was
private and personal.

374
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,514
Waiter, bring some
champagne right away.

375
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:12,385
Very good, My Lord.

376
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,518
[LAUGHS]

377
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,999
It'’d seem, Bosie,
that I am forever paying

378
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,523
for your indiscretions
and your extravagances.

379
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,221
Money, is that all
you ever think of?

380
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,919
Ah, when I was young
I thought money was
everything.

381
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,660
Now that I'’m older
I know that it is.

382
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,792
My God, Oscar,
you'’re never satisfied.

383
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:29,924
You have a successful book out,

384
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,142
a play running
in the West End...

385
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,449
Playing to packed
houses of creditors.

386
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:36,322
Have you any idea
how much money I'’ve spent
since we'’ve been together?

387
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,281
I'’m sure you've
kept an account.

388
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:43,590
Luncheon every day here,
dinner at the Savoy,
supper at...

389
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,287
Oh, look what you'’ve done.
- I'’m sorry, sir.

390
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,854
Please.
- Oh, go away, stop fussing.

391
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,292
And always the best champagne

392
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,512
because you have
a very delicate palate.

393
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,863
Bosie, you seem to think
that you have a right to
live at my expense

394
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,823
in a profuse luxury to
which you have never
been accustomed.

395
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:03,305
I pay
your hotel bills,
your tailor'’s bill,

396
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,698
your gambling debts.

397
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:09,703
You demand
without grace and you
receive without thanks.

398
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,358
Have you finished?

399
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,146
Now tell
me honestly, Oscar.
What did you expect, hmm?

400
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,583
Did you think I was
some common street Arab

401
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,237
to be bought
with cheap trinkets

402
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,501
and an occasional supper
in some Soho restaurant?

403
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,851
I'’ve given
you my friendship
for two years, Oscar.

404
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:31,333
I'’ve admired your genius,
laughed at your jokes,
flattered your vanity.

405
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,771
And now you question the
price of such a friendship.

406
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,556
It isn'’t worthy of you, Oscar.

407
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,731
Good evening, Mr. Wilde.
- Evening, William.

408
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:23,124
Sydney.

409
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,387
Thank you, sir.

410
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:27,476
Good evening, Mr. Wilde.
- Good evening.

411
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,001
I want you to take
this to this address.

412
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,700
It'’s just around the corner.

413
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,747
Straight away, hmm?
- Right away, sir.

414
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:42,448
Hello, Robbie.

415
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,014
Hello, Oscar.

416
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,147
What will you have?

417
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,671
Brandy, and a large one.

418
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,456
John. A large brandy.

419
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,459
Give me a cigarette,
there'’s a dear fellow.

420
00:22:53,502 --> 00:22:54,503
I seem to have
left mine at home.

421
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,810
What?
- A cigarette.

422
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:57,941
Oh, yes, of course.

423
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:00,248
Thank you.

424
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,607
What is it, Oscar?
Are you not well?

425
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:13,479
No, just very tired,
that'’s all.

426
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,436
[SIGHS]

427
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,394
Your brandy, sir.

428
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,309
Thank you.

429
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:25,708
Oscar, did you know that
some of the club members

430
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,884
have approached
the Committee
to get you to resign?

431
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,669
Well, I hope not. I shall
have to find somewhere else

432
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,410
to sleep in the afternoons.

433
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,412
Have you any idea how much
people are talking about you

434
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,543
or what they are saying?

435
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:36,850
I adore scandal
about other people,

436
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,505
but about myself
I find it extremely dull.

437
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,507
It hasn'’t the charm of novelty.

438
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,901
I don'’t think you'll
find this gossip dull.

439
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:47,687
Robbie, are you being
solicitous about my welfare?

440
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,471
That is very
impertinent of you.

441
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,994
I don'’t mean to be.

442
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,997
Oscar, I realize
that much of your
extravagant behavior

443
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,260
is done purely for effect.
You'’re an artist.

444
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,349
The public expects
you to be different.

445
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:01,396
But you'’re no longer
an ascetic young poet
just down from Oxford.

446
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
Relax.
- You'’re a highly
successful playwrighter

447
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,400
at the peak of your career.

448
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,795
You dine with royalty.
You mix in the highest
social circles.

449
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,579
Ah.

450
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,102
You'’re walking along
a precipice, Oscar.

451
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,714
Just as long
as you continue
to play court jester,

452
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,063
society will accept you.

453
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,674
But tax their tolerance too far

454
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,633
and they'’ll send you
crashing from the heights

455
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,678
to the depths of obscurity.
- Oh, really.

456
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,507
A halo doesn'’t have to fall
very far, Oscar, to become
a noose.

457
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,378
Really, Robbie,
this all very tedious.

458
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,511
Just tell me one thing.

459
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,732
These stories I hear about you.

460
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,516
There isn'’t any truth
in them, is there?

461
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,909
As I don'’t know
what the stories are,

462
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,258
I'’m hardly in a position
to answer you.

463
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,086
They say that you...

464
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:43,394
You'’re being
blackmailed because of
your association with Bosie.

465
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:48,530

criminals, stable boys.

Do go on.

you tell me it isn'’t true.

Robbie,

471

I'’m deeply hurt
that you use our friendship
to pry into my private life.

472
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,206
I thought
you were a gentleman.
I now see that you are not.

473
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,990
I just want to
hear you deny it, Oscar.

00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,036
You must think
what you will, Robbie.

Mr. Wood to see you, sir.

476
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:19,692
Thank you.

477
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:30,746
Robbie, because
I'’m very fond of you

I shall forget everything

Hello, Oscar.

482
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,589
Lovely club you'’ve got here.

00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,113
[OSCAR LAUGHING]
- I like that.

484
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,724
I'’d like some
champagne tonight.

485

Oh, you shouldn'’t
have bothered.

486

You must eat something.

487
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,753
All right?

488
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,363
You know, I'’ve eaten in all
of the best restaurants
in Europe

489
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:24,583
but I'’ve never tasted
anything like your
sweetbreads.

490
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,367
Where'’s the wine?

491
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,978
They didn'’t deliver
any this week.

492
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,590
For heaven'’s sake, why not?

493
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,593
Perhaps the fact that we
owe the wine merchant L85

494
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,856
might have something
to do with it.

495
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,641
We'’re living on credit,
Oscar, and that can'’t
go on much longer.

496
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,253
Well, if I can
finish this play,
everything will be all right.

to see Mr. Oscar Wilde.

ARTHUR: I'’m sorry, sir,
but Mr. Wilde is not at home.

Well, I'’m sorry,
but I demand to
see him.

You can'’t go in there, sir.

503
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,182
If you please, sir.

504
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,706
Wilde, I want to have
a word with you. Sit down.

505
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:05,319
Well, Lord Queensberry.
It'’s all right, Arthur,
you can go.

506
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:08,365
It seems
the peerage don'’t have
a monopoly of good manners.

507
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,237
To hell with good manners, sir.

508
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,935
What I have to say
to you has very little
to do with good manners.

509
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,285
Indeed?
And I presume you'’ve
brought your ugly friend

510
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,983
to lend you moral support.

511
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,202
When it comes
to morals, I have
all the support I need,

512
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,161
thank you very much.

513
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,467
I'’ve seldom
come across anybody in whom
the moral sense was dominant

514
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:27,341
who was not heartless,
cruel, vindictive
and completely lacking

515
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,430
in the smallest
sense of humanity,
Lord Queensberry.

516
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:32,738
Personally,
I'’d sooner have
50 unnatural vices

517
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,435
than one unnatural virtue.

518
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,612
Yes, I can
well believe that.
Now, you listen to me, sir.

519
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,266
I presume you have
come to make a speech.

520
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,921
If so,
I hope it'’s a short one
because I have work to do.

I'’ve come here today
to protest against

524
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:57,676
your disgusting
relationship with my son.

525
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:06,728
That is a revolting
and slanderous statement,

526
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,556
and I demand an apology.

527
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,297
I refuse to apologize.

528
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,258
I refuse to apologize for
saying something which is
common knowledge

529
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:17,739
to every cab driver
and messenger boy
in London.

530
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,610
Lord Queensberry,
are you seriously
suggesting that

531
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:21,830
there is improper conduct
between your son and myself?

532
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,268
I do not say that you are.

533
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:28,271
I say
that you look it,
which is just as bad.

534
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:29,490
But I'’ll tell you this.

535
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,189
If I catch you
two again together,

536
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:37,803
I shall take a whip to you,
sir, and I shall thrash
you to the ground.

537
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,461
I see that when
it comes to fighting,

538
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,508
you choose to ignore
the Queensberry rules.

539
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,640
Yes, well,
I give you fair warning.
- And I give you fair warning.

540
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,730
If you'’re not out of
my house in two minutes,
I shall throw you out.

541
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,253
I refuse to leave
until I'’ve had my say.

542
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:55,255
On the contrary, sir,
you are leaving now.

543
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:57,736
Hit him! Hit him!

544
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:04,307
Arthur, open the door!
This gentleman is leaving.

545
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:05,265
Gladly, sir.

546
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,922
This, Arthur,
is the Marquis
of Queensberry.

547
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,707
The most infamous brute in
London and you'’re never to
let him in my house again.

548
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,013
Is that clear?
- Perfectly, sir.

549
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,319
Now get out.

550
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,799
Very well.

551
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,888
But you'’ll regret this,
I promise you.

552
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,020
I promise you.

553
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,329
Go back to your room
this instant.

554
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:29,376
Will that be all, sir?

555
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,594
I hope so, Arthur.

556
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,218
Now, this has got to stop.

557
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:49,439
You are the only one
who can stop it, Oscar.

558
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,964
My God, am I
not allowed to get on
with my work in peace?

559
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,617
What with creditors
knocking at the door

560
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,532
and Bosie dropping in
as if this was some
sort of club.

561
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:58,579
And now this coarse brute
with his hired pugilists.

562
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,669
I can stand brute force,
but brute reason is
quite intolerable.

563
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,801
It'’s like hitting
below the intellect.

564
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:10,417
Oscar, I beg of you
to give up this friendship
with Bosie.

565
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,160
Not for me,
but for your own sake.

566
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,205
He takes up
too much of your time,

567
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,207
demands too much
of your emotions.

568
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,253
I know.

569
00:30:21,776 --> 00:30:25,171
The truth is the boy has
a strange fascination
for me

570
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,174
that I can'’t get free of.

571
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:34,571
He needs you more
than you need him.

572
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:37,574
He needs you
because he is
weak and conceited.

573
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,142
And you give him
a stature he could
never acquire alone.

574
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,884
And he will
go on taking and taking
until there'’s nothing left.

575
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,538
He'’ll destroy you, Oscar.

When I married you,

577
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:51,675
I didn'’t believe
it was possible to love
anybody more than I loved you.

Help me.

Why not go away
for a little while?

At least until you
have finished your play.

Maybe it will
give you a chance
to think more clearly.

Yes, I may.

You always liked the sea.
Why not go down to Brighton?

a good boy, please,

You'’re very kind, Mrs. Burgess.

Well, if we can'’t show
a little kindness
on this earth,

614
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,881
we might
as well not be here,
that'’s the way I see it.

Now, you keep nice and warm.

Are you sure this is
the right place,

This is where
I brung him, sir.

Why, yes, sir.

[CHUCKLING]
How extraordinary.

Ah, may I step inside?
- Certainly, sir.

626
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,983
Which is his room?

It'’s just at
the top of the stairs.

Oh, but I'’d rather
you didn'’t disturb him, sir.

629
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:39,860
You see, he was out
all night and he'’s
not at all well.

630
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,689
Indeed?

631
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:45,518
I was wondering if
I'’d send for the doctor.

632
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,346
A doctor, madam,
would probably
prescribe

a little less brandy
in his soda.

you were in Brighton,

Naturally.

I have a most delightful

Well, there'’s no doubt,
Mr. Wilde,

954
00:56:19,288 --> 00:56:21,552
on the basis
of what is written
on this card alone,

955
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,510
you have the strongest
possible grounds

956
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:26,426
for an action against
Lord Queensberry for
criminal libel.

957
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:29,298
Does that mean,
Sir Edward, that
you will take the case?

958
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,213
Well, the question is,
of course,

959
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:32,824
do you want to proceed
with this action?

960
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:34,391
Well, of course!

961
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,002
Why do you ask that,
Sir Edward?

962
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:38,612
Well, no doubt,
Queensberry'’s defense

963
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,919
will be that the libelous
statement complained of

964
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:43,704
was justified
and in effect true.

965
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:45,619
It most certainly isn'’t true.

966
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:49,014
Nevertheless, the defense
will make every effort to
prove that it is,

967
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,451
and that could be extremely
embarrassing for Mr. Wilde.

968
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:53,453
I agree. Oscar,
it simply isn'’t worth it.

969
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,194
Queensberry'’s
obviously a lunatic.

970
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:57,544
To take
an action against him
is exactly what he wants.

971
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,459
That'’s why he left that card.

him get away with this,
there'’ll be no holding him.

The witness may stand down.

any suggestion by the defense

not leave this card at

to malign the character
of Mr. Oscar Wilde,

in evidence a letter

I didn'’t press them to drink.

You did not stint them?

What gentleman
would stint his guests?

What gentleman would stint
his valet and a groom,

My Lord, I really must protest
at my learned friend'’s
sneering remarks.

Mr. Carson, I suggest
you confine yourself to

Very well, My Lord.

that Taylor, Atkin and Parker

1378

had been arrested in a raid

Yes, I read about that.

You know
that they were charged

But you know him?

Yes, he was a manservant
at Lord Alfred'’s house
in Oxford.

Oh, dear, no.
He was extremely ugly.

Is that the reason
you did not kiss him?

Mr. Carson,
you are very insolent.

Did you say that
you never kissed him?

It'’s a foolish question.

I don'’t know
why I mentioned
that he was ugly

as conclusive proof as to

not going beyond

complained of were
justified or they were not.

then the statement,

01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:20,350
The prosecution
must have scraped

1663
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:23,048
the bottom of the barrel
to get that lot together.

1664
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:26,530
What I cannot understand
is how a man of Wilde'’s
taste and breeding

1665
01:34:26,573 --> 01:34:28,271
can come to associate
with such people.

1666
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:29,968
Well, to understand that,
Charles,

1667
01:34:30,012 --> 01:34:31,622
you'’d have to understand the
nature of Wilde'’s perversion.

1668
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:33,842
And I'’m a lawyer, not a doctor.

1669
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:37,149
To me, it'’s loathsome,
degenerate and unnatural.

1670
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:40,936
Yet I feel so sorry for him.

1671
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:44,896
It is a terrible thing,
Charles, when a man of
Wilde'’s talents and genius

1672
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:48,987
is slowly crucified by
a lot of blackmailers
and common criminals.

1673
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:54,732
There'’s very little hope
for an acquittal, is there?

1674
01:34:54,776 --> 01:34:58,344
Well, the case
has already been judged
by the press and the public.

1675
01:34:58,388 --> 01:35:01,478
As far as
they'’re concerned,
Wilde is guilty.

1676
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:04,916
It only remains for him
to be sentenced.

1677
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,009
The most we can hope for is
that, out of this hysteria
of prejudice and hatred,

1678
01:35:11,053 --> 01:35:15,840
there might shine
a glimmer of Christian
charity and forgiveness.

1679
01:35:15,884 --> 01:35:17,973
Do I understand
you to say then,
Mr. Wilde,

1680
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,715
that there is no
truth whatsoever in the
evidence of Alfred Wood?

1681
01:35:21,933 --> 01:35:23,718
It'’s true
that we had
supper together,

1682
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:26,677
but the accusations of
impropriety are quite untrue.

1683
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,636
Charles Parker,
what part of his
evidence is untrue?

1684
01:35:31,247 --> 01:35:33,031
He never came
to the hotel with me.

1685
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:35,077
He never had dinner with me
and he never came to my room.

1686
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,865
We had tea
at the St. James'’s once,
but all of the rest...

1687
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:42,606
Is untrue.

1688
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:45,478
Then, Atkin.
What of his evidence?

1689
01:35:45,522 --> 01:35:47,611
My Lord,
my learned friend
seems to have forgotten

1690
01:35:47,654 --> 01:35:49,787
that the witness Atkin
perjured himself in
the box.

1691
01:35:49,831 --> 01:35:52,311
Your Lordship dismissed
this witness for that reason.

1692
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:55,358
The witness'’s evidence was
not struck from the record,
Sir Edward.

1693
01:35:55,401 --> 01:35:57,882
In my humble submission,
My Lord, it should have been.

What of Atkins'’
evidence, Mr. Wilde?

The accusations of indecency
are quite untrue.

In fact,
these witnesses,
according to you,

In this magazine, to

entitled Two Loves.

1721
01:37:22,314 --> 01:37:24,186
It contains these lines.

01:37:25,448 --> 01:37:27,493
"Sweet youth,

"'’Have thy will,

"'’I am the love that

And what, Mr. Wilde,
is the love that dare
not speak its name?

1737
01:38:23,985 --> 01:38:27,945
The love
that dare not speak
its name, in this century,

1738
01:38:27,989 --> 01:38:31,601
is such a great affection
of an elder for a younger man.

As there was between
David and Jonathan.

the sonnets of Michelangelo
and Shakespeare.

1742
01:38:42,394 --> 01:38:46,877
It is a deep,
spiritual affection

1743
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:49,227
that is as perfect
as it is pure.

1744
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:54,537
It is in this
century misunderstood,
so much misunderstood

1745
01:38:54,580 --> 01:39:00,238
that it may
be called the love that
dare not speak its name.

1746
01:39:00,282 --> 01:39:03,241
And on account of it,
I'’m placed where I
am today.

But it is beautiful,

01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:09,073
it is fine,

1749
01:39:09,117 --> 01:39:11,641
it is the noblest
form of affection.

1750
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:13,773
There is nothing
unnatural about it.

1751
01:39:14,774 --> 01:39:16,602
It is intellectual.

1752
01:39:16,646 --> 01:39:20,650
And is repeatedly to be
found between an elder
and a younger man

1753
01:39:20,693 --> 01:39:25,742
when the elder man has
intellect and the younger
man has all the hope and joy

And yours is a position
of great responsibility.

Now, a great deal of
public feeling has been

by the
quotation of passages
of poetry and literature

1773

and in particular
from Mr. Wilde'’s book,
The Picture of Dorian Gray.

1774
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:48,129
Now I ask you,

1775
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:52,437
is an author to be judged on
the morals of the characters
of his book?

being a lustful and

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

1778
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:03,405
As to the affection which
Mr. Wilde expressed in
his letters,

1779
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:06,451
he himself
has described it as
pure, true affection,

1783

Mr. Wilde is not
an ordinary man.

He is a man
who has written

charming essays.

1786
01:41:25,949 --> 01:41:28,691
He writes letters in
a tone which to most
of us may appear

1787
01:41:28,734 --> 01:41:34,479
high- flown, inflated,
exaggerated, even absurd.

1788
01:41:34,523 --> 01:41:38,483
But he'’s not ashamed
or afraid to produce
those letters.

1789
01:41:38,527 --> 01:41:41,573
When a man comes forward
with letters such as
these and says,

"I do not shrink
from the judgment of the
world upon these productions,"

1791

has he not given the
best proof of his innocence?

is at the peril
of such persons.

01:42:16,565 --> 01:42:19,220
Before you consider
this case, therefore,

1801
01:42:19,263 --> 01:42:24,007
I implore you to
let your judgment only be
affected by those witnesses

true, honest and
honorable testimony.

1805

And if, upon the examination
of the evidence, you find
it your duty to say

1806
01:42:36,846 --> 01:42:40,110
that the charges
against the prisoner
have not been proved,

You look lovelier than ever.

Oh, it'’s good
to see you, Oscar.

Ticket, madam?

The gentleman has them.
Thank you.

Oh, Robbie,
I can'’t bear to
see him looking so ill.

I was talking to the
prison doctor yesterday.

02:06:46,163 --> 02:06:48,601
Another six months in there

I want you to remember this.

I have always loved you,

about these past two years.

You'’ll start work again.

Ada, don'’t be so depressed
on my behalf.

What better reward
for one'’s sins than
to be exiled to Paris?

I shall die as I have lived,

What a gorgeous hat.
