1
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:30,582
Jesus!

2
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,243
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,668
"I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:39,863
"...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:43,129
"lf you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,229
"...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...

7
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,220
"...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,976
"lf I do not hear from you...

9
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,910
"...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a....

10
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,428
"...Scorpio."

11
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:02,202
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,577
Kooks.

13
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,572
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:11,157
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:16,024
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,061
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,526
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:25,277
Inspector Callahan. He's outside.

19
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:31,518
Send lnspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:35,926
Callahan?

21
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,414
Mr. Mayor, lnspector Callahan.

22
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,695
All right.

23
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,073
Let's have it.

24
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,620
-What?
-Your report. What have you done?

25
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,282
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,262
...I've been sitting in your
outer office waiting on you.

27
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:55,230
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:00,763
Won't you sit down, lnspector Callahan?

29
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,543
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:15,899
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,820
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,495
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,971
...rifle nuts, peepers--

34
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,629
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,932
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:35,510
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:37,467
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:39,834
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,460
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:44,346
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist--

41
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:46,299
We're running a computer check...

42
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:50,107
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,764
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:52,981
Why?

45
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,935
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,010
Thank you, lnspector.

47
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,632
Mention this note to anyone?

48
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,406
How about you?

49
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,740
Nobody.

50
00:08:06,943 --> 00:08:08,732
Your wife, sweetheart? Press?

51
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,171
Nobody.

52
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:16,218
All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.

53
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:19,573
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,750
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:23,674
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,626
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,829
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,589
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:34,263
Nope, none of that.
It would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:37,278
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,221
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,139
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,372
That's my policy.

64
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,772
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:08:55,967 --> 00:09:00,124
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:01,912
Intent?

67
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,671
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:10,165
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,629
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:19,382
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:14,613
-lnspector Callahan.
-Jaffee.

72
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,347
Usual.

73
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:19,448
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,141
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:23,292
Not much.

76
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,996
Hey, Jaffee...

77
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,934
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,135
Tan Ford?

79
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:38,997
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,246
Engine running?

81
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,930
I don't know. How can I tell?

82
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:47,579
-Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
-That's awful!

83
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,883
Look at that pollution.

84
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,380
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,319
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:01,270
Police Department?

87
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:04,122
Tell them lnspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,352
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:10,453
Got it.

90
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:13,884
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,191
In progress.

92
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:16,601
Yes, sir.

93
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:24,537
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

94
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,404
Shit!

95
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:43,891
Halt!

96
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,354
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,621
Did he fire six shots or only five?

98
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:14,808
To tell the truth, in all the excitement
I've kind of lost track myself.

99
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,229
But since this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun...

100
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,635
...and would blow
your head clean off...

101
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,889
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

102
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,647
Well, do you, punk?

103
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,749
I got to know.

104
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,854
Son of a bitch!

105
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:15,158
It looks like we can save that leg.

106
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:17,147
I've got a couple under my knee.

107
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,066
Ever consider
another line of work?

108
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,620
I really appreciate this, Steve.

109
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:24,157
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

110
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,041
Nothing fancy, now.

111
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,686
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

112
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,822
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

113
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,174
-I haven't got all night.
-You might experience discomfort.

114
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,888
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

115
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,133
Sorry, Harry.

116
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,012
What will you do with those?

117
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:46,425
Cut your pants off.

118
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:49,339
-No. We'll pull them off.
-lt'll hurt.

119
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,956
For $29.50, let it hurt.

120
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,646
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

121
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,278
-Good morning, lnspector.
-Maria.

122
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,285
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

123
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:30,387
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

124
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,413
Whenever you do.

125
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:36,535
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

126
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,963
-Put in for overtime.
-That'll be the day.

127
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:42,329
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

128
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,560
-He was?
-He wanted me to tell you: "Well done! "

129
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,701
I can't tell you how moved I am.

130
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,942
I pass along a compliment...

131
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,917
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

132
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,998
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

133
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,380
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

134
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:03,422
-I'll get right on it.
-Now wait a minute!

135
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,141
I'll put somebody with you.

136
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,925
What are you saying?

137
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,533
You need a partner.

138
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:17,176
-What's wrong with the one I've got?
-He's in the hospital!

139
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,761
-He'll be out in a few weeks.
-Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

140
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,577
-He'll be working with you.
-You must be kidding.

141
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,913
I have no time to break in newcomers.

142
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,177
-Why don't you do this boy a favor?
-What do you mean?

143
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:33,469
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

144
00:17:33,662 --> 00:17:35,004
...and Fanduchi's dead.

145
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:36,409
So?

146
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:41,043
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

147
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,391
What about DiGeorgio?

148
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:43,867
No way!

149
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,234
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

150
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,405
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

151
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,408
I got it.

152
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:59,291
If you see DiGeorgio, send him in here!

153
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,205
You from around here?

154
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,471
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

155
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,020
-Play ball?
-No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

156
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:11,069
Just what I need is a college boy.

157
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:15,059
-Found anything you like about me yet?
-It's early yet.

158
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,401
-Get your degree?
-Sociology.

159
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:22,388
-Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.
-I intend to.

160
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,695
Inspector Callahan.

161
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,507
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

162
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:30,011
I'll remember that.

163
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,003
-Hero! Nice work yesterday.
-Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

164
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:37,980
You're a sweet man, Harry.

165
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,274
There is one question,
lnspector Callahan.

166
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,604
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

167
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,562
That's one thing about our Harry.

168
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:51,034
Doesn't play favorites.

169
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,605
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

170
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,307
You name it.

171
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,364
-How does he feel about Mexicans?
-Ask him!

172
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,931
Especially spics.

173
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:51,771
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

174
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,908
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

175
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,327
You, on the roof!

176
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,282
You, there!

177
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,202
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

178
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,989
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

179
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:44,755
I don't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

180
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,867
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

181
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:51,772
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

182
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:53,493
That's possible.

183
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:03,862
-Attention, all units.
-Turn that thing up louder.

184
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:08,662
Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

185
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:09,974
He is an adult male.

186
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:13,719
Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

187
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:16,154
When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

188
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,060
...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

189
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:21,596
He had a tan suitcase...

190
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,946
...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted....

191
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:29,403
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

192
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:31,480
I know what you mean.

193
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:35,417
There!

194
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,280
What?

195
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:38,104
Tan suitcase.

196
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:39,192
Where?

197
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:40,666
I lost him.

198
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:44,212
There he goes, over there.

199
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:45,691
Does that bag look tan?

200
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,058
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

201
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:49,847
Go to Filber and hang a left.

202
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:51,764
Look out for these people!

203
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:52,762
Fruitcake!

204
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,998
Get out of the way, hammerhead!

205
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:02,195
It was a tan suitcase. I know it was.

206
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:05,533
I saw him.

207
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:07,319
-There he is.
-I see him.

208
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,771
Car 2, the license number...

209
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:14,715
...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

210
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:23,644
-How do you want to work this?
-Find another way in. I'll go in here.

211
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,587
Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

212
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,121
Car 2. It's an lmpala convertible.

213
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:33,912
10-4.

214
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,536
You can cancel that 1 0-25.
Three cars here.

215
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:12,216
Anybody home?

216
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,020
Did you bring me a present?

217
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:38,133
Let me see it.

218
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:53,784
It's beautiful!

219
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,718
Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

220
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,792
You getting an eyeful?

221
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,161
You goddamn pie hawker!

222
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,627
-We should call the police.
-I am a police--

223
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,828
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

224
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,495
Let them go.

225
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:27,420
You heard me.

226
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:29,239
They assaulted a police officer.

227
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:32,504
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

228
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:34,589
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

229
00:26:34,782 --> 00:26:36,189
Beat it. Get out of here.

230
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,734
-How about the man with the suitcase?
-Wrong number.

231
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,804
I just had another thought.

232
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,435
Yeah? About what?

233
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:51,027
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

234
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:59,225
Inspector 71.

235
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:04,637
Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

236
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,899
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

237
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,958
-This is lnspector 71.
-I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

238
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:14,711
California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

239
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,634
1 0-4. We're on our way.

240
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,074
It's some idiot.

241
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,285
Where? I don't see him.

242
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:43,129
-There he is.
-Yeah. Now I see him.

243
00:27:44,926 --> 00:27:48,538
I have a 1 0-29 and a 10-28.

244
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,930
In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

245
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:56,763
California license.
D-dog, C-Charlie, V-Victor 4-7-2.

246
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,890
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

247
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:25,948
-Anybody try to talk him down?
-Yeah, no luck. But now you're here....

248
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:28,892
-You mean, I go up.
-We'd sure appreciate it.

249
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,605
Look at him go, will you?
He's going to get hurt!

250
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:40,157
Don't you try to get me!

251
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:44,918
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

252
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:49,045
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

253
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:54,068
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

254
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:56,245
Won't you try to grab me?

255
00:29:57,502 --> 00:30:02,172
A friend of mine was up about 20 floors
with a jumper a few years ago.

256
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,504
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

257
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,749
Mashed all over.

258
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:10,041
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which....

259
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:13,402
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

260
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:16,733
-I'd just like your name and address.
-Why?

261
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:19,381
It's such a mess down there afterwards!

262
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:23,641
It makes identification impossible.
Even if they find your driver's license!

263
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:25,179
All that blood!

264
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,899
I think I'm going to puke!

265
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:34,648
Don't do that, son.
All those people down there looking up.

266
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,693
The fire chief looking up.
With his face....

267
00:30:38,366 --> 00:30:39,576
You rotten bastard!

268
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,972
Get the stretcher out here.

269
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:43,515
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes along.

270
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,205
Inspector 71.

271
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,592
This is lnspector 71.

272
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:06,198
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

273
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:09,556
What about him?

274
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:12,441
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

275
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,221
Anybody know who the boy is?

276
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:18,453
His name was Charlie Russell.

277
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,275
I'm his mother.

278
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:23,827
He's only 10 years old.

279
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,703
Inspector, this officer--
Oh, Jesus Christ!

280
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,006
You'd better go check on the mother.

281
00:32:54,046 --> 00:32:55,126
What do you have?

282
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,296
That 30-06 shell casing.

283
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,217
He was up here all right.

284
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:06,490
Welcome to Homicide.

285
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:28,792
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

286
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:31,189
...has to sell these for a living!

287
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,785
.458 Magnum?

288
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,557
-This thing will stop an elephant.
-Yeah.

289
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:47,315
-Apparently you like a little edge.
-All I can get, sir.

290
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,616
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

291
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:52,406
What have you got, Lieutenant?

292
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:56,829
The blue flags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

293
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,258
-Double shifts and overtime.
-At nighttime.

294
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,203
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

295
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,326
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

296
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:08,981
-Except here.
-Right. The North Beach area.

297
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,807
We're saving that for him.

298
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,589
-Have you found a good stakeout?
-I think so.

299
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:17,651
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

300
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,862
Something bothering you?

301
00:34:20,573 --> 00:34:21,369
Nothing.

302
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,704
Speak up.
You're among friends here.

303
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:26,935
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

304
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:30,133
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

305
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:33,846
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

306
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,786
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

307
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:41,658
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

308
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,338
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

309
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,811
Scorpio strikes again.

310
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,365
They like that feeling.

311
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:53,078
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

312
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:56,245
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's church.

313
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:58,485
And they're having a novena tonight.

314
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:00,246
Go on.

315
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:03,637
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

316
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,431
The Russell boy was black.

317
00:35:05,629 --> 00:35:09,273
He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.

318
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:25,787
Inspector 71.

319
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,339
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

320
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,431
How about the priest?

321
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,858
-He knows he's being set up for bait?
-Yeah, he wanted to.

322
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,925
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

323
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:02,517
Who?

324
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:05,397
Never guess.

325
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:08,917
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

326
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:39,131
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

327
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:55,609
Son-of-a-bitch took the bait!

328
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,099
When I say " now,"
hit him with the light.

329
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:40,849
Now!

330
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,946
-You all right?
-I think so.

331
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,060
Call an ambulance.

332
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,159
Collins never knew what hit him.

333
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:26,387
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

334
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:28,891
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

335
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,856
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

336
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,828
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

337
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:22,425
Ann-Mary Deacon.

338
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:26,004
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

339
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:30,580
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

340
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:32,601
"Ann-Mary Deacon, buried alive."

341
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:36,474
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

342
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:40,120
" Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

343
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:43,895
" New ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

344
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:46,102
"One man with yellow bag.

345
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:48,854
"South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

346
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:50,427
"9 p. m.

347
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,760
"She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. tomorrow.

348
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,413
" Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

349
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:59,290
"Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

350
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:02,103
"...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio."

351
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:05,491
Anything else?

352
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:11,223
The mother identified the bra,
the hank of hair.

353
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:12,628
And that.

354
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,487
The dentist identified that.

355
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,932
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

356
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:21,845
You know she's dead.

357
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:26,268
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

358
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:30,769
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

359
00:42:31,645 --> 00:42:33,172
He's using up a lot of favors.

360
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,787
He wants to pay.

361
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:39,891
No tricks.

362
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:47,645
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

363
00:42:49,661 --> 00:42:50,643
You got it.

364
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:53,812
-Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
-All right.

365
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:56,598
-Wait a minute. What about me?
-You're out.

366
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:58,520
No cover?
Not even one man?

367
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:02,108
Sure that's how to do it?

368
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:05,148
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

369
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:10,876
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

370
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:14,167
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

371
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:17,972
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

372
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,981
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

373
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,006
Testing 1, 2, 3--

374
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:37,433
-What are you yelling for?
-All you have to do is whisper.

375
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,503
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow."

376
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,228
Okay, that's better.

377
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:45,276
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

378
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:46,876
...forget it.

379
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:49,270
All right, Sid. What do I owe you?

380
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:51,509
Bring it back in one piece.

381
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:57,273
$200,000.

382
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,378
Count it and sign for it.

383
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:03,772
Did you count it out?

384
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:07,864
Did you count it, chief?

385
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:11,705
It's not my responsibility.

386
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:17,204
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

387
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:22,995
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

388
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:29,779
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

389
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:32,315
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

390
00:44:32,573 --> 00:44:35,508
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

391
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,489
Nothing cute. Nothing fancy.

392
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:49,848
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

393
00:44:52,573 --> 00:44:55,355
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

394
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:09,265
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

395
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:14,807
-You got a yellow suitcase?
-Yeah, I got it right with me.

396
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,250
-What's your name?
-Callahan.

397
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,933
-What are you?
-Police officer.

398
00:46:24,444 --> 00:46:25,786
Hello?

399
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,035
All right, police officer...

400
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:39,992
...this is how we play.

401
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:44,248
I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

402
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,700
If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

403
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:51,861
If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

404
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:53,595
...the girl dies.

405
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:56,756
-ls the girl okay?
-Just shut up and listen.

406
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:58,330
No car.

407
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:02,326
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

408
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:06,004
I ring 4 times.
You don't answer by the fourth ring...

409
00:47:06,205 --> 00:47:08,147
...that's the end of the game.

410
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:10,165
The girl dies.

411
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:12,154
What time you got?

412
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:16,280
-9:30. Now listen--
-You listen.

413
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:18,451
I'm watching you.

414
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:22,516
Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

415
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:27,772
Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

416
00:47:33,405 --> 00:47:36,220
-Yeah.
-I hope you're not stupid.

417
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,329
Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

418
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:21,144
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

419
00:50:21,757 --> 00:50:23,699
You sound like you had a good rest.

420
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:27,445
You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

421
00:50:27,644 --> 00:50:30,993
You better make it,
because if you don't, dead girl!

422
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:34,263
Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

423
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,380
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

424
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:13,523
What's in the bag, man?

425
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,882
-You dudes get lost now, you hear?
-Screw the bag!

426
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:19,383
Just give us the wallet.

427
00:51:23,037 --> 00:51:24,662
You don't listen, asshole!

428
00:51:51,293 --> 00:51:53,049
Don't answer that!

429
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:06,300
-Who picked it up?
-Some old guy. Never saw him before.

430
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:12,566
Chico, he hung up.

431
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:17,241
-You know Mt. Davidson Park?
-Yeah.

432
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:18,647
Go to the cross.

433
00:52:56,157 --> 00:52:58,328
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

434
00:52:59,324 --> 00:53:01,266
I'm going up.

435
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,010
I see a couple of people.

436
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:22,040
Just a couple of kids necking.

437
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:24,438
Boys or girls?

438
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,501
I'm Callahan.

439
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,498
My friends call me Alice.

440
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:50,330
And I will take a dare.

441
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:54,362
When was the last time
you were busted?

442
00:53:54,877 --> 00:53:57,779
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

443
00:53:58,332 --> 00:53:59,609
Well, do it at home.

444
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:01,684
Freeze!

445
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:04,441
Just like a statue.

446
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,769
That's right.

447
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:10,332
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

448
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:13,077
I'll kill you and the girl both.

449
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:15,065
Understand?

450
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:17,686
Yeah.

451
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:20,436
Drop the bag.

452
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:25,210
Left hand.

453
00:55:25,692 --> 00:55:27,285
Let's see the gun.

454
00:55:32,604 --> 00:55:33,749
My!

455
00:55:34,204 --> 00:55:35,765
That's a big one.

456
00:55:37,245 --> 00:55:39,099
Left hand. Throw it.

457
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:41,526
Easy.

458
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:47,066
Raise your hands.

459
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,951
Come on, get them up.

460
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:53,782
Now turn.

461
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,703
Face the cross.

462
00:55:58,236 --> 00:55:59,316
Come on.

463
00:55:59,516 --> 00:56:02,233
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

464
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,286
You lift that hand once more and
I won't let you know where the girl is!

465
00:56:27,644 --> 00:56:29,400
Do we understand each other?

466
00:56:30,364 --> 00:56:31,640
Do we understand each other?

467
00:56:32,988 --> 00:56:34,897
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

468
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,693
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

469
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:39,031
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

470
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,449
Do we understand each other?

471
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:47,701
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

472
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,045
Listen to me carefully.

473
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,766
I've changed my mind.

474
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:53,909
I'm going to let her die.

475
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,944
I just wanted you to know that.

476
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:06,515
You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

477
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,011
Goodbye, Callahan!

478
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:27,767
Chico, don't kill him!

479
00:59:18,076 --> 00:59:21,305
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, Chief.

480
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,736
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

481
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:25,594
He's right here.

482
00:59:25,788 --> 00:59:27,348
He's got two cracked ribs.

483
00:59:27,548 --> 00:59:30,297
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

484
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:33,590
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

485
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:35,032
I'm sending him home.

486
00:59:35,228 --> 00:59:36,569
Right, Chief.

487
00:59:37,564 --> 00:59:39,320
He says beat it! That's an order.

488
00:59:41,372 --> 00:59:44,755
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

489
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,469
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

490
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,773
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

491
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:53,558
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

492
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,447
What am I going to tell him?

493
00:59:57,852 --> 01:00:00,154
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

494
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:03,832
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

495
01:00:04,092 --> 01:00:06,547
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

496
01:00:06,748 --> 01:00:10,131
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

497
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:14,710
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

498
01:00:21,596 --> 01:00:23,701
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

499
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:28,250
-Put him on.
-What is it?

500
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:33,879
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

501
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:38,418
Yeah, doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

502
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:40,695
Long blond hair...

503
01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:45,529
...medium build, about 150 pounds.
Pale complexion.

504
01:00:45,756 --> 01:00:49,237
-He didn't give you his name, doc?
-Nope.

505
01:00:50,332 --> 01:00:51,957
They usually give a phony name.

506
01:00:53,372 --> 01:00:55,259
But I've seen him someplace.

507
01:00:55,772 --> 01:00:59,765
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

508
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:01,938
I'm trying to think!

509
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,481
It was....

510
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:05,779
I believe he works around here.

511
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,046
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

512
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:10,837
Yes, just a moment.

513
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,369
She'll be dead in an hour!

514
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,514
I'm trying to remember!

515
01:01:20,796 --> 01:01:22,618
I've got who he is.

516
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:27,510
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

517
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:30,807
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

518
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:33,492
-Live where?
-There.

519
01:01:38,363 --> 01:01:39,924
Kezar Stadium.

520
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:43,796
Illegal entry. No warrant.

521
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:45,782
Looks like we climb.

522
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,529
Too much linguine.

523
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:52,310
I'll find another way.

524
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,322
Stop!

525
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:24,533
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

526
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:26,964
You need any help?

527
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:32,340
-Go on and get some air, fatso.
-Please! No more!

528
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:36,114
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

529
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,772
Let me have a doctor!

530
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:41,403
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

531
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:43,377
The girl, where is she?

532
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,824
You tried to kill me!

533
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:49,045
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

534
01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:50,387
I want a lawyer.

535
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:52,442
I said, where's the girl?

536
01:06:52,795 --> 01:06:54,257
I have the right for one.

537
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:55,888
Where's the girl?

538
01:06:56,091 --> 01:06:59,190
I have the right for a lawyer!

539
01:06:59,963 --> 01:07:01,457
Don't! Please!

540
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:03,643
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

541
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,954
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

542
01:08:41,148 --> 01:08:44,977
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

543
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:48,341
-It's lnspector Callahan.
-Have him come in, please.

544
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,478
Won't you come this way?

545
01:08:51,868 --> 01:08:55,129
-May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
-No, thanks.

546
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:05,174
I'll be done in a minute.

547
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,225
Have a seat.

548
01:09:11,483 --> 01:09:14,799
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

549
01:09:16,347 --> 01:09:19,544
A very unusual piece of police work.

550
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:22,486
Really amazing.

551
01:09:23,707 --> 01:09:24,819
I had some luck.

552
01:09:25,019 --> 01:09:28,761
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

553
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,151
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

554
01:09:36,347 --> 01:09:40,242
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

555
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:43,572
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

556
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:47,448
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

557
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:52,217
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

558
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:56,182
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

559
01:09:56,379 --> 01:09:58,681
You should be.
I've got news for you.

560
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,526
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

561
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:04,241
What are you talking about?

562
01:10:04,507 --> 01:10:05,620
He's free!

563
01:10:06,523 --> 01:10:07,767
You're letting him go?

564
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,686
We have to.
We can't try him.

565
01:10:09,884 --> 01:10:11,160
And why is that?

566
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:14,257
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

567
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,598
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

568
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:19,505
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

569
01:10:19,707 --> 01:10:21,201
What do you call that?

570
01:10:21,404 --> 01:10:22,516
I call it nothing.

571
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:24,117
Zero.

572
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:29,079
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

573
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:32,210
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

574
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,386
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

575
01:10:36,443 --> 01:10:38,964
-But it's inadmissible as evidence!
-Who says?

576
01:10:39,163 --> 01:10:40,276
It's the law.

577
01:10:40,956 --> 01:10:42,417
Then the law is crazy!

578
01:10:43,451 --> 01:10:46,168
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

579
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:51,153
He also holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

580
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:52,370
Your Honor?

581
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:58,297
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

582
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:02,453
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

583
01:11:02,651 --> 01:11:04,561
...is inadmissible in court.

584
01:11:04,763 --> 01:11:08,592
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

585
01:11:08,859 --> 01:11:11,958
-It's that simple.
-Search warrant? A girl was dying!

586
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:15,067
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

587
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:16,503
But I didn't know that!

588
01:11:17,019 --> 01:11:21,689
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

589
01:11:21,915 --> 01:11:25,974
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

590
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:30,100
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

591
01:11:30,299 --> 01:11:31,543
...physical evidence...

592
01:11:31,803 --> 01:11:33,974
...would have to be excluded.

593
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:41,595
You can get him on something!

594
01:11:41,788 --> 01:11:44,635
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

595
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:48,086
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

596
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:52,025
Now, the suspect's rights...

597
01:11:52,219 --> 01:11:54,008
...were violated...

598
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,308
...under the 4th and 5th...

599
01:11:56,507 --> 01:11:59,289
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

600
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:01,938
And Ann-Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

601
01:12:02,139 --> 01:12:05,074
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

602
01:12:05,275 --> 01:12:06,836
The district attorney's office!

603
01:12:07,739 --> 01:12:09,430
If you'll let us.

604
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:14,964
I have a wife and kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

605
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:16,950
He won't be out there long.

606
01:12:17,147 --> 01:12:19,286
What is that supposed to mean?

607
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:22,609
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

608
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,395
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

609
01:12:26,011 --> 01:12:30,135
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

610
01:12:30,491 --> 01:12:31,920
How do you know?

611
01:12:33,147 --> 01:12:34,773
Because he likes it.

612
01:14:56,379 --> 01:14:58,102
You sure you weren't tailed?

613
01:14:58,555 --> 01:14:59,732
Yeah.

614
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:25,590
You really want $200 worth.

615
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:28,473
Every penny of it.

616
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:43,610
Might as well be comfortable.

617
01:15:44,283 --> 01:15:45,843
Go on, sit.

618
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:54,617
Relax.

619
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:57,658
Take it easy.

620
01:15:58,075 --> 01:16:00,311
It's going to be all right.

621
01:16:39,931 --> 01:16:42,102
You sure you want the rest of it?

622
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:44,533
Every penny's worth!

623
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:49,295
You black son of a bitch!

624
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:12,474
This one's on the house.

625
01:17:26,586 --> 01:17:28,147
That's got to be him.

626
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:34,420
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

627
01:17:34,618 --> 01:17:36,473
I swear it. As God is my judge.

628
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,739
Why are they harassing you?

629
01:17:38,939 --> 01:17:40,914
They tried to frame me with the murder.

630
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,897
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

631
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:48,182
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty and look at what they did to me.

632
01:17:48,379 --> 01:17:51,510
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

633
01:17:52,027 --> 01:17:54,842
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

634
01:17:55,034 --> 01:17:57,074
-Did you see who did this to you?
-Yes.

635
01:17:57,275 --> 01:17:58,452
Can you identify him?

636
01:17:58,651 --> 01:18:03,124
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

637
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:08,532
Now, that's the reruns
from the 4 o'clock news.

638
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,600
Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.

639
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:15,286
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

640
01:18:16,187 --> 01:18:17,878
What about it, Harry?

641
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,233
-You want my star?
-I want an answer.

642
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,126
Have you been following him?

643
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:28,083
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

644
01:18:28,282 --> 01:18:30,519
-Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
-How?

645
01:18:31,099 --> 01:18:33,783
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

646
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:37,270
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

647
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:40,085
I don't want any more surveillance!

648
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:42,646
Neither does he.

649
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:45,521
What does that mean?

650
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:48,884
Good night, sir.

651
01:18:52,538 --> 01:18:54,262
Go ahead. Try them.

652
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:58,259
-Guy makes them where I always eat.
-Thank you.

653
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:00,946
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

654
01:19:01,978 --> 01:19:04,499
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

655
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:08,146
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

656
01:19:11,195 --> 01:19:14,195
Doing a lot of thinking about it and....

657
01:19:16,123 --> 01:19:19,254
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

658
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:21,841
...what for? You know?

659
01:19:25,115 --> 01:19:27,930
-Time for therapy.
-You hang in there now.

660
01:19:33,691 --> 01:19:35,698
See you tomorrow. Same time?

661
01:19:57,627 --> 01:20:00,212
-It's my fault, you know.
-What?

662
01:20:00,859 --> 01:20:03,225
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

663
01:20:03,418 --> 01:20:04,825
No class.

664
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:07,667
-Don't ever say that.
-What?

665
01:20:07,931 --> 01:20:09,687
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

666
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:13,652
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

667
01:20:13,978 --> 01:20:16,083
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

668
01:20:16,283 --> 01:20:18,704
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

669
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:21,176
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

670
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:26,007
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

671
01:20:26,203 --> 01:20:27,447
And I think...

672
01:20:28,507 --> 01:20:30,896
...what if it's the last time I see him?

673
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:33,490
Am I the only one?

674
01:20:33,851 --> 01:20:35,639
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

675
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:37,075
No.

676
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,211
You mean she got used to it?

677
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,425
No, she never did, really.

678
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:43,863
What then?

679
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:45,751
She's dead.

680
01:20:46,778 --> 01:20:48,469
Please, forgive me.

681
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:52,247
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

682
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:53,784
No reason for it, really.

683
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:56,822
-I'm so sorry.
-That's okay.

684
01:20:57,531 --> 01:20:59,091
I want you to tell Chico...

685
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:02,134
...that I understand him quitting.

686
01:21:02,331 --> 01:21:05,331
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

687
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:08,978
-Why do you stay in it, then?
-I don't know.

688
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:11,897
I really don't.

689
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:49,846
Let me have a 5th of Seagram's.
Please.

690
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:53,146
What the hell happened to you?

691
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:55,226
My wife's brother.

692
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:56,530
I hit her...

693
01:21:56,731 --> 01:21:58,389
...so he hit me.

694
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,015
Several times.

695
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:02,927
$5.69.

696
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:07,858
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

697
01:22:08,059 --> 01:22:10,448
14 times the last 3 years.

698
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,552
Last 2 times, they sent them
out here on platters.

699
01:22:13,755 --> 01:22:16,275
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

700
01:22:17,339 --> 01:22:20,884
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

701
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:23,570
Please, I scare easy.

702
01:22:26,522 --> 01:22:29,370
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

703
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:05,459
Goodbye.

704
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,438
See you tomorrow.

705
01:23:17,946 --> 01:23:20,434
Everybody out who gets out here?

706
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:22,224
School bus inspector.

707
01:23:22,427 --> 01:23:24,947
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody--

708
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:26,805
I'm authorizing it, so go.

709
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,726
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

710
01:23:28,922 --> 01:23:33,079
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

711
01:23:35,067 --> 01:23:38,515
-Where?
-Just get started. I'll tell you where.

712
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:44,691
Let's have some fun now.

713
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,352
Who knows a song?

714
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,620
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

715
01:23:49,978 --> 01:23:51,701
Come on, sing for us.

716
01:23:52,603 --> 01:23:54,970
Old McDonald had a farm

717
01:23:55,163 --> 01:23:56,985
E-l-E-l-O

718
01:23:57,178 --> 01:23:59,895
And on his farm, he had some ducks.

719
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:34,553
-Millie, this is lnspector Callahan.
-The Mayor is waiting for you.

720
01:25:38,618 --> 01:25:41,204
-What's up?
-Another note from our boy.

721
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:45,330
-Who's he grabbed now?
-That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

722
01:25:47,451 --> 01:25:50,102
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in 1/2 an hour.

723
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:53,618
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

724
01:25:54,074 --> 01:25:55,929
Tell them the man is dangerous.

725
01:25:56,122 --> 01:25:59,701
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

726
01:26:00,027 --> 01:26:01,521
"To the City of San Francisco...

727
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:04,111
"You double-crossed me
for the last time.

728
01:26:04,315 --> 01:26:08,788
" I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

729
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:13,175
" I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

730
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:16,022
"...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

731
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:18,389
"...exactly what I say. Scorpio."

732
01:26:21,243 --> 01:26:23,250
Better have somebody standing by!

733
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,338
I don't think it's a false alarm.

734
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:27,669
There's a call for you on line 2.

735
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:30,234
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

736
01:26:36,634 --> 01:26:39,449
-It's the Mayor.
-I got 7 kids from Park Street School.

737
01:26:41,786 --> 01:26:42,964
I got the bus and....

738
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:46,545
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

739
01:26:46,746 --> 01:26:48,634
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

740
01:26:48,922 --> 01:26:50,264
Just tell him.

741
01:26:50,682 --> 01:26:52,089
Not my fault, he had a gun--

742
01:26:52,282 --> 01:26:53,264
Just your name!

743
01:26:57,082 --> 01:26:58,544
This is Marcella Platt.

744
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:02,768
You can check if you want.
But I don't see any point.

745
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,531
I'm not bullshitting.

746
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:07,600
It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...

747
01:27:07,802 --> 01:27:09,329
...the kids start dying.

748
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:13,011
-The plane ready?
-It's being fueled, and ready to go.

749
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:15,893
The money will be there
by the time you get there.

750
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:19,254
Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

751
01:27:19,451 --> 01:27:21,360
Just me and a busload of kids.

752
01:27:21,562 --> 01:27:24,791
I'll turn off at Sir Drake Blvd.,
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

753
01:27:24,986 --> 01:27:26,644
I don't want any police cars...

754
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:28,052
...helicopters, whatever.

755
01:27:28,314 --> 01:27:32,307
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

756
01:27:32,506 --> 01:27:34,132
Where are you going?

757
01:27:34,746 --> 01:27:37,299
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

758
01:27:39,706 --> 01:27:42,838
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

759
01:27:43,034 --> 01:27:44,529
I give you my word of honor.

760
01:27:45,818 --> 01:27:47,673
Marcella Platt. It checks.

761
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:53,811
Willing to take the money to him?

762
01:27:54,138 --> 01:27:58,229
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

763
01:27:58,426 --> 01:28:01,361
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

764
01:28:01,947 --> 01:28:04,729
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

765
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:06,613
And that's a direct order!

766
01:28:08,506 --> 01:28:11,768
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

767
01:29:29,274 --> 01:29:31,281
Row, row, row your boat

768
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:33,522
Gently down the stream

769
01:29:33,722 --> 01:29:37,813
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

770
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:43,447
Where are we going?

771
01:29:44,378 --> 01:29:47,923
-This isn't the right way!
-We're going to the ice cream factory.

772
01:29:48,122 --> 01:29:50,009
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

773
01:29:50,202 --> 01:29:52,690
I want to go home to my mother.

774
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:54,101
Go home to your what?

775
01:29:54,906 --> 01:29:56,564
Now, sing! Sing again!

776
01:29:56,762 --> 01:29:58,322
Row, row, row your boat

777
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:00,344
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

778
01:30:01,946 --> 01:30:04,085
Are you sick? What is it?

779
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:07,346
Sing or your mothers will die!

780
01:30:07,546 --> 01:30:10,197
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

781
01:30:17,242 --> 01:30:19,097
Get in the right-hand lane.

782
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,591
Not right to treat children that way.

783
01:30:21,786 --> 01:30:24,241
-You'll hurt them.
-Just drive the goddamn bus!

784
01:30:24,442 --> 01:30:26,416
And get in the right-hand lane!

785
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,057
I want my mother.

786
01:30:43,066 --> 01:30:44,593
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

787
01:30:44,794 --> 01:30:45,940
Make a right there.

788
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,280
Not this one.

789
01:30:52,858 --> 01:30:54,200
I want my mother.

790
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:56,149
Shut up!

791
01:30:58,394 --> 01:30:59,920
Just get to the right!

792
01:31:14,234 --> 01:31:15,728
Jesus!

793
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,556
What the hell is he doing up there?

794
01:31:30,362 --> 01:31:33,396
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

795
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:46,226
Drop the gun, creep!

796
01:34:48,954 --> 01:34:50,961
I'll blow his brains out.

797
01:34:54,266 --> 01:34:55,924
Drop the fucking gun!

798
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,092
I know what your thinking, punk.

799
01:35:44,282 --> 01:35:47,577
You're thinking:
"Did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?"

800
01:35:48,506 --> 01:35:51,768
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself,
in all this excitement.

801
01:35:52,665 --> 01:35:56,244
But being this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun...

802
01:35:56,442 --> 01:35:59,126
...and will blow your head clean off...

803
01:35:59,385 --> 01:36:01,273
...you've got to ask yourself...

804
01:36:02,522 --> 01:36:04,212
..."Do I feel lucky?"

805
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:11,988
Well, do you, punk?
