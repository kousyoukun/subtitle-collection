1
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,450
Jesus!

2
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,224
''To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,796
''I wiII enjoy kiIIing
one person every day...

4
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,127
''...untiI you pay me
one hundred thousand doIIars.

5
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,533
''If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,765
''...at personaI coIumn,
San Francisco ChronicIe...

7
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,841
''...and I wiII set up meeting.

8
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,672
''If I do not hear from you...

9
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:07,774
''...it'II be my next pIeasure
to kiII a CathoIic priest or a....

10
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,442
''...Scorpio.''

11
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,420
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,854
Kooks.

13
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:22,020
Where the heII does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand doIIars?

14
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:25,758
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:30,832
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminaIs not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,999
Instead, we pay a poIice department.

17
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,612
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,481
Inspector CaIIahan. He's outside.

19
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,988
Send Inspector CaIIahan in.

20
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,584
CaIIahan?

21
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,221
Mr. Mayor, Inspector CaIIahan.

22
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,557
AII right.

23
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:57,994
Let's have it.

24
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,693
- What?
- Your report. What have you done?

25
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,468
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,575
...I've been sitting in your
outer office waiting on you.

27
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:11,713
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're taIking to.

28
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:17,482
Won't you sit down, Inspector CaIIahan?

29
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,765
There's a madman Ioose.

30
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,265
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:39,439
We've got a dozen men
checking identification fiIes.

32
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:43,271
Checking on aII known extortionists,
rooftop prowIers...

33
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,810
...rifIe nuts, peepers---

34
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,538
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:49,983
We've arranged for rooftop
surveiIIance and heIicopters...

36
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,713
...especiaIIy around
the CathoIic churches and schooIs...

37
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:55,754
...and in the bIack area.

38
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,222
BaIIistics is checking on the sIug.

39
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,917
We're sure it's a 30- 06.

40
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,927
Seven Iands and grooves,
right-hand twist---

41
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,963
We're running a computer check...

42
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,934
...on everybody in the fiIes
whose birthday faIIs between...

43
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,662
...October 23 and November 21 .

44
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:11,931
Why?

45
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:13,968
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,174
Thank you, Inspector.

47
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,908
Mention this note to anyone?

48
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,886
How about you?

49
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,277
Nobody.

50
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:28,354
Your wife, sweetheart? Press?

51
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:29,855
Nobody.

52
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:36,160
AII right. Give the message
to the ChronicIe.

53
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:39,658
We'II pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,928
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,934
You'II pIay this creep's game?

56
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,970
It'II give us breathing space.

57
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:48,267
It might get somebody kiIIed.

58
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,145
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,976
Nope, none of that.
It wouId end up with a reaI bIoodbath.

60
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,119
I agree with the chief.
We'II do it this way.

61
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,188
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, CaIIahan, Iet's go.

62
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,530
I don't want troubIe, Iike you had
Iast year in the FiIImore district.

63
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,858
That's my poIicy.

64
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,403
When an aduIt maIe
is chasing a femaIe...

65
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:21,941
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my poIicy.

66
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:23,805
Intent?

67
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:25,640
How did you estabIish that?

68
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:32,411
When a naked man chases a woman in
an aIIey with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:36,023
...I figure he isn't out
coIIecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,022
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:39,611
- Inspector CaIIahan.
- Jaffee.

72
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,420
UsuaI.

73
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,653
UsuaI Iunch, or usuaI dinner?

74
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,418
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,661
Not much.

76
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,523
Hey, Jaffee...

77
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,630
...is that tan Ford stiII
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,967
Tan Ford?

79
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,037
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,339
Engine running?

81
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,181
I don't know. How can I teII?

82
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:13,985
- Exhaust fumes out of the taiIpipe.
- That's awfuI!

83
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,388
Look at that poIIution.

84
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,162
Do me a favor, wiII you?

85
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,227
CaII this teIephone number.

86
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,261
PoIice Department?

87
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,235
TeII them Inspector CaIIahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,603
...two-eIeven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:37,836
Got it.

90
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,414
Be sure and teII them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,777
In progress.

92
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:44,247
Yes, sir.

93
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,522
Now, if they'II just wait
tiII the cavaIry arrives.

94
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,597
Shit!

95
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:12,703
HaIt!

96
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,730
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,137
Did he fire six shots or onIy five?

98
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:47,503
To teII the truth, in aII the excitement
I've kind of Iost track myseIf.

99
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,070
But since this is a .44 Magnum,
the most powerfuI handgun...

100
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,578
...and wouId bIow
your head cIean off...

101
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:58,014
...you've got to ask yourseIf
one question: ''Do I feeI Iucky?''

102
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,847
WeII, do you, punk?

103
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,936
I got to know.

104
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,857
Son of a bitch!

105
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,430
It Iooks Iike we can save that Ieg.

106
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,504
I've got a coupIe under my knee.

107
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,505
Ever consider
another Iine of work?

108
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,168
I reaIIy appreciate this, Steve.

109
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,813
We Potrero HiII boys
have to stick together.

110
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,778
Nothing fancy, now.

111
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,579
Just a IittIe tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

112
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,848
Do I teII you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

113
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,386
- I haven't got aII night.
- You might experience discomfort.

114
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:17,259
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

115
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,600
Sorry, Harry.

116
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,559
What wiII you do with those?

117
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,032
Cut your pants off.

118
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:26,071
- No. We'II puII them off.
- It'II hurt.

119
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,800
For $29.50, Iet it hurt.

120
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,605
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

121
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,723
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Maria.

122
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,072
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

123
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,435
When the heII
you going to get a haircut?

124
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,547
Whenever you do.

125
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:17,845
Who's got time? I was up tiII 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

126
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,420
- Put in for overtime.
- That'II be the day.

127
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,887
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pIeased.

128
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:27,256
- He was?
- He wanted me to teII you: ''WeII done!''

129
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,488
I can't teII you how moved I am.

130
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,825
I pass aIong a compIiment...

131
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:35,970
...you couId be a IittIe poIite.
It might not kiII you to say thanks.

132
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,139
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

133
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,709
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

134
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,880
- I'II get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

135
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,673
I'II put somebody with you.

136
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,747
What are you saying?

137
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,423
You need a partner.

138
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,222
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospitaI!

139
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,960
- He'II be out in a few weeks.
- Say heIIo to Chico GonzaIes.

140
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,896
- He'II be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

141
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,332
I have no time to break in newcomers.

142
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,735
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

143
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:17,211
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospitaI...

144
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:18,811
...and Fanduchi's dead.

145
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,276
So?

146
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,108
If I need a partner, I'II get me one
who knows what he's doing.

147
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,514
What about DiGeorgio?

148
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:28,053
No way!

149
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:30,521
You work with GonzaIes
or you don't work.

150
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,785
Straight from the fifth fIoor.
Got it?

151
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,959
I got it.

152
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,136
If you see DiGeorgio, send him in here!

153
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,174
You from around here?

154
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,537
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

155
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:53,237
- PIay baII?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

156
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,417
Just what I need is a coIIege boy.

157
00:18:56,618 --> 00:19:00,577
- Found anything you Iike about me yet?
- It's earIy yet.

158
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,019
- Get your degree?
- SocioIogy.

159
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:08,219
- SocioIogy! You'II go far, if you Iive.
- I intend to.

160
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,625
Inspector CaIIahan.

161
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,599
Don't Iet your degree get you kiIIed.
I'm IiabIe to get kiIIed with you.

162
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,168
I'II remember that.

163
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,373
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! BressIer wants to see you.

164
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,477
You're a sweet man, Harry.

165
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:32,082
There is one question,
Inspector CaIIahan.

166
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,512
Why do they caII you Dirty Harry?

167
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,554
That's one thing about our Harry.

168
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,089
Doesn't pIay favorites.

169
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:42,855
Harry hates everybody: Iimeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

170
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,629
You name it.

171
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,860
- How does he feeI about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

172
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,536
EspeciaIIy spics.

173
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:46,545
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

174
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,773
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

175
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,235
You, on the roof!

176
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,273
You, there!

177
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,275
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

178
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,181
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

179
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,792
I don't know
how the heIicopter boys Iost him!

180
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,037
How couId they Iet him get out
without seeing him?

181
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,108
They were probabIy taIking instead of
Iooking, Iike they were supposed to.

182
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:50,903
That's possibIe.

183
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,715
- Attention, aII units.
- Turn that thing up Iouder.

184
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:06,720
ProwIer Iast seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

185
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,088
He is an aduIt maIe.

186
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:11,993
Caucasian. Repeat,
aduIt maIe Caucasian.

187
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,532
When Iast seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

188
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:18,604
...paIe bIue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gIoves.

189
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,206
He had a tan suitcase...

190
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:24,742
...which probabIy contains a
30-06 rifIe. He's wanted....

191
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:28,347
Those Ioonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whoIe bunch!

192
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,512
I know what you mean.

193
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:34,617
There!

194
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:35,517
What?

195
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,419
Tan suitcase.

196
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:38,554
Where?

197
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:40,090
I Iost him.

198
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,788
There he goes, over there.

199
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,330
Does that bag Iook tan?

200
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,798
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

201
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,664
Go to FiIber and hang a Ieft.

202
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,663
Look out for these peopIe!

203
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:52,703
Fruitcake!

204
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,035
Get out of the way, hammerhead!

205
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,539
It was a tan suitcase. I know it was.

206
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:06,020
I saw him.

207
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,882
- There he is.
- I see him.

208
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,524
Car 2, the Iicense number...

209
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,594
...at 10- 32 on that ChevroIet,
CoIorado pIates.

210
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:24,904
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another way in. I'II go in here.

211
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,973
Car 2, what's the modeI
of that ChevroIet?

212
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,743
Car 2. It's an ImpaIa convertibIe.

213
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:35,611
10- 4.

214
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:50,859
You can canceI that 10- 25.
Three cars here.

215
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,551
Anybody home?

216
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,371
Did you bring me a present?

217
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,574
Let me see it.

218
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,894
It's beautifuI!

219
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,996
Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg roIIs?

220
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,372
You getting an eyefuI?

221
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,842
You goddamn pie hawker!

222
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,414
- We shouId caII the poIice.
- I am a poIice---

223
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,050
Up against the waII.
Right now! Move.

224
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:31,959
Let them go.

225
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:33,966
You heard me.

226
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,863
They assauIted a poIice officer.

227
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,268
A poIice officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

228
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:41,442
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

229
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,110
Beat it. Get out of here.

230
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,977
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

231
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:54,178
I just had another thought.

232
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:55,879
Yeah? About what?

233
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,582
About why
they caII you Dirty Harry.

234
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,130
Inspector 71.

235
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,773
Inspector 71.
PIease respond to your caII.

236
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:16,174
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

237
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,407
- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

238
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,277
CaIifornia HaII
at PoIk and Turk streets.

239
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:25,282
10-4. We're on our way.

240
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:47,638
It's some idiot.

241
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,943
Where? I don't see him.

242
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,909
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

243
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:58,549
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

244
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:02,086
In 600 bIock of Baker.
On a ChevroIet.

245
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,125
CaIifornia Iicense.
D-dog, C-CharIie, V-Victor 4-7-2.

246
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,770
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

247
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:37,557
- Anybody try to taIk him down?
- Yeah, no Iuck. But now you're here....

248
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,626
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

249
00:29:44,566 --> 00:29:47,626
Look at him go, wiII you?
He's going to get hurt!

250
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:54,935
Don't you try to get me!

251
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:59,900
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourseIf kiIIed. Not me.

252
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,203
AIways happens with you guys.
The Iast minute you want to...

253
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:09,440
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

254
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,710
Won't you try to grab me?

255
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:17,890
A friend of mine was up about 20 fIoors
with a jumper a few years ago.

256
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,322
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

257
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:21,620
Mashed aII over.

258
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:26,095
CouIdn't teII which Iegs was
with which, which arms with which....

259
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,600
It was a terribIe mess.
I teII you, I aImost threw up myseIf.

260
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,073
- I'd just Iike your name and address.
- Why?

261
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,834
It's such a mess down there afterwards!

262
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:40,276
It makes identification impossibIe.
Even if they find your driver's Iicense!

263
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,880
AII that bIood!

264
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:47,844
I think I'm going to puke!

265
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:51,753
Don't do that, son.
AII those peopIe down there Iooking up.

266
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,929
The fire chief Iooking up.
With his face....

267
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,892
You rotten bastard!

268
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,312
Get the stretcher out here.

269
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:03,562
Now you know why I'm caIIed Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes aIong.

270
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,879
Inspector 71.

271
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:22,411
This is Inspector 71 .

272
00:33:22,617 --> 00:33:27,213
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

273
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,715
What about him?

274
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,723
Shot in the face.
BIew part of it away.

275
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:37,665
Anybody know who the boy is?

276
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,992
His name was CharIie RusseII.

277
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:41,892
I'm his mother.

278
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,595
He's onIy 10 years oId.

279
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,149
Inspector, this officer---
Oh, Jesus Christ!

280
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:04,551
You'd better go check on the mother.

281
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,231
What do you have?

282
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,537
That 30- 06 sheII casing.

283
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,540
He was up here aII right.

284
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:30,081
WeIcome to Homicide.

285
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:53,335
The man who designed bIue serge
uniforms for poIice departments...

286
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:55,834
...has to seII these for a Iiving!

287
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,712
.458 Magnum?

288
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,688
- This thing wiII stop an eIephant.
- Yeah.

289
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:12,649
- ApparentIy you Iike a IittIe edge.
- AII I can get, sir.

290
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,091
He's no eIephant, Harry.
He's no animaI of any kind.

291
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,958
What have you got, Lieutenant?

292
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:22,569
The bIue fIags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

293
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,102
- DoubIe shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

294
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,173
DayIight, the heIicopters
wiII keep him off the roofs.

295
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:32,472
We're going for high visibiIity. Units
wiII make themseIves very noticeabIe.

296
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,240
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

297
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,144
We're saving that for him.

298
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,045
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

299
00:35:40,254 --> 00:35:44,281
It's a buiIding that overIooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

300
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,586
Something bothering you?

301
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,158
Nothing.

302
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:50,592
Speak up.
You're among friends here.

303
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:53,961
It seems a Iong shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

304
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:57,296
There are a Iot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

305
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:01,167
Most of them are Iocked.
This particuIar one'II be open for him.

306
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:05,276
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

307
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:09,313
We know they'II rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

308
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:12,108
Must appeaI to their
superego or something.

309
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,686
Scorpio strikes again.

310
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,349
They Iike that feeIing.

311
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:21,221
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

312
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,523
He's got a cIear view
of the St. Peter and PauI's church.

313
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:26,859
And they're having a novena tonight.

314
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,695
Go on.

315
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,231
The note. He threatened
to kiII a priest or a Negro.

316
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,101
The RusseII boy was bIack.

317
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:38,108
He may just figure
he owes himseIf a padre.

318
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,327
Inspector 71.

319
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:59,031
We're in position
to start our surveiIIance.

320
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,151
How about the priest?

321
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:27,725
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

322
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,965
We toId him we had a voIunteer
wiIIing to take his pIace.

323
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:33,626
Who?

324
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,629
Never guess.

325
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,299
Yeah, I know.
WeIcome to Homicide.

326
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:14,366
You owe it to yourseIf
to Iive a IittIe, Harry.

327
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,548
Son-of-a-bitch took the bait!

328
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:35,187
When I say ''now,''
hit him with the Iight.

329
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:18,720
Now!

330
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,572
- You aII right?
- I think so.

331
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,997
CaII an ambuIance.

332
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,229
CoIIins never knew what hit him.

333
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,765
Let's go. CIear the aIIey.
There's nothing to see.

334
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:11,376
CaII headquarters.
He's Ioose in North Beach.

335
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:01,390
It's a whoIe new baII game, feIIows.

336
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:04,489
He grabbed a 14- year- oId girI.

337
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:07,197
Ann- Mary Deacon.

338
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:10,928
The bomb squad got a caII.
Suspicious object in GoIden Gate Park.

339
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:15,700
It was addressed to the mayor. The Iab
sent it to us, with this Ietter inside.

340
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,807
''Ann- Mary Deacon, buried aIive.''

341
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,846
The poor kid went to the movies
Iast night and never came home.

342
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:25,647
''DoubIe- crossing San Francisco poIice
made me do this.

343
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,584
''New ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

344
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,885
''One man with yeIIow bag.

345
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:34,754
''South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

346
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,395
''9 p.m.

347
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:38,827
''She has oxygen
tiII 3 a.m. tomorrow.

348
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,593
''Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

349
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:45,636
''MoIe on Ieft thigh. Anything cute
and you'II force me to Iet girI die...

350
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,569
''...of sIow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio.''

351
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:52,102
Anything eIse?

352
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,079
The mother identified the bra,
the hank of hair.

353
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:59,544
And that.

354
00:43:59,753 --> 00:44:01,482
The dentist identified that.

355
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,117
Said it was puIIed out
with a pair of pIiers.

356
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,154
You know she's dead.

357
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:13,766
AII I know is the Ietter says
she'II be aIive untiI 3 a.m.

358
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:18,460
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

359
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,965
He's using up a Iot of favors.

360
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:24,735
He wants to pay.

361
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:27,971
No tricks.

362
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,056
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

363
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,182
You got it.

364
00:44:39,393 --> 00:44:42,487
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- AII right.

365
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:45,392
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

366
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,396
No cover?
Not even one man?

367
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,137
Sure that's how to do it?

368
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,307
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. AII right?

369
00:44:56,377 --> 00:45:00,279
No wonder they caII him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

370
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:03,711
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankIes.

371
00:45:04,585 --> 00:45:07,679
AI, Iet's spIit the difference.
Give him the night off.

372
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,816
Get the heII out of here,
both of you.

373
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,397
Testing 1, 2, 3- -

374
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,971
- What are you yeIIing for?
- AII you have to do is whisper.

375
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:31,172
''Mary had a IittIe Iamb,
its fIeece as white as snow.''

376
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:32,970
Okay, that's better.

377
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,149
It's good for 2 or 3 bIocks.
But in a tunneI...

378
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,817
...forget it.

379
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,313
AII right, Sid. What do I owe you?

380
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:42,648
Bring it back in one piece.

381
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,658
$200,000.

382
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:50,853
Count it and sign for it.

383
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:55,435
Did you count it out?

384
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,701
Did you count it, chief?

385
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:03,706
It's not my responsibiIity.

386
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:09,440
AIways knew I'd get rich
on the poIice force.

387
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:15,479
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

388
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,552
God knows how he'II contact you.
He'II probabIy run you aII over town.

389
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:25,197
Go where you're toId.
Do what you're toId.

390
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:28,526
PIay it straight down the Iine. Okay?

391
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:39,976
Nothing cute. Nothing fancy.

392
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,479
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

393
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,221
WouId you mind if I borrowed
a IittIe Scotch tape?

394
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:03,725
It's disgusting that a poIice officer
shouId know how to use that weapon.

395
00:48:08,335 --> 00:48:12,066
- You got a yeIIow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

396
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,741
- What's your name?
- CaIIahan.

397
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:20,539
- What are you?
- PoIice officer.

398
00:48:22,115 --> 00:48:23,514
HeIIo?

399
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:36,286
AII right, poIice officer...

400
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,327
...this is how we pIay.

401
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,764
I bounce you aII over town
to make sure you're aIone.

402
00:48:43,236 --> 00:48:46,364
If I even think you're being foIIowed,
the girI dies.

403
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:50,703
If you taIk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a Iamppost...

404
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:52,511
...the girI dies.

405
00:48:52,713 --> 00:48:55,807
- Is the girI okay?
- Just shut up and Iisten.

406
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,448
No car.

407
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:01,615
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

408
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,450
I ring 4 times.
You don't answer by the fourth ring...

409
00:49:05,659 --> 00:49:07,684
...that's the end of the game.

410
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:09,788
The girI dies.

411
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:11,862
What time you got?

412
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,165
- 9:30. Now Iisten---
- You Iisten.

413
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,428
I'm watching you.

414
00:49:19,072 --> 00:49:22,667
Not aII the time,
but you'II never know when or where.

415
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:28,147
Now get to Forest HiIIs Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

416
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:36,956
- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.

417
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:19,821
Downstairs.
Take the ''K'' car.

418
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:23,799
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'II bIow it.

419
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,588
You sound Iike you had a good rest.

420
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:35,494
You'II need it. I'm going to give you
a nice IittIe run this time.

421
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:39,194
You better make it,
because if you don't, dead girI!

422
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,603
PubIic phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

423
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,939
Hubba- hubba- hubba, pig bastard.

424
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,540
What's in the bag, man?

425
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:28,085
- You dudes get Iost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

426
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:29,650
Just give us the waIIet.

427
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,155
You don't Iisten, asshoIe!

428
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:04,754
Don't answer that!

429
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:18,571
- Who picked it up?
- Some oId guy. Never saw him before.

430
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:25,105
Chico, he hung up.

431
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,979
- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.

432
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,445
Go to the cross.

433
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,821
I'm at the entrance
on LansdaIe Street.

434
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,885
I'm going up.

435
00:55:30,276 --> 00:55:32,301
I see a coupIe of peopIe.

436
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:37,546
Just a coupIe of kids necking.

437
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:40,046
Boys or girIs?

438
00:55:58,805 --> 00:56:00,966
I'm CaIIahan.

439
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:05,134
My friends caII me AIice.

440
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:07,044
And I wiII take a dare.

441
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:11,248
When was the Iast time
you were busted?

442
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,811
If you're a vice, I'II kiII myseIf.

443
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:16,719
WeII, do it at home.

444
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,446
Freeze!

445
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,320
Just Iike a statue.

446
00:57:25,258 --> 00:57:26,748
That's right.

447
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:30,463
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

448
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:33,325
I'II kiII you and the girI both.

449
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,398
Understand?

450
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,131
Yeah.

451
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,999
Drop the bag.

452
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:45,976
Left hand.

453
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:48,140
Let's see the gun.

454
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:54,880
My!

455
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:56,982
That's a big one.

456
00:57:58,525 --> 00:58:00,459
Left hand. Throw it.

457
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:02,989
Easy.

458
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:08,766
Raise your hands.

459
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:10,731
Come on, get them up.

460
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:15,769
Now turn.

461
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:17,772
Face the cross.

462
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,539
Come on.

463
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,581
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

464
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:50,704
You Iift that hand once more and
I won't Iet you know where the girI is!

465
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,908
Do we understand each other?

466
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:55,244
Do we understand each other?

467
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:58,640
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

468
00:58:58,851 --> 00:59:00,512
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

469
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,950
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

470
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:06,514
Do we understand each other?

471
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:11,991
If you care what happens to the girI,
you'd better answer me! AII right?

472
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:13,392
Listen to me carefuIIy.

473
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,229
I've changed my mind.

474
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,464
I'm going to Iet her die.

475
00:59:20,373 --> 00:59:22,671
I just wanted you to know that.

476
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,608
You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I kiIIed you.

477
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,552
Goodbye, CaIIahan!

478
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,768
Chico, don't kiII him!

479
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,155
The hospitaI report on GonzaIes
Iooks okay, Chief.

480
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:54,690
Yeah. WeII, he's a pretty tough kid.

481
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:56,627
He's right here.

482
01:01:56,829 --> 01:01:58,456
He's got two cracked ribs.

483
01:01:58,664 --> 01:02:01,531
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

484
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:04,965
The son of a bitch reaIIy
kicked him a coupIe of beauts.

485
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:06,468
I'm sending him home.

486
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:08,071
Right, Chief.

487
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:10,939
He says beat it! That's an order.

488
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,606
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

489
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,479
Meaning, am I just pIain stupid
or did I deIiberateIy disobey him?

490
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:22,881
He wants to know
what GonzaIes was doing there.

491
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:25,785
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

492
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,755
What am I going to teII him?

493
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:32,663
Why don't you start
by teIIing him the truth?

494
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:36,498
TeII him GonzaIes was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

495
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:39,329
TeII him you didn't know
anything about it.

496
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:43,066
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

497
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,841
You wouIdn't have a beIt of booze
around here, wouId you?

498
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,216
Lieutenant BressIer's office.

499
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:01,959
- Put him on.
- What is it?

500
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:07,828
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the Ieg.

501
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,561
Yeah, doctor?
What'd this guy Iook Iike?

502
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:14,936
Long bIond hair...

503
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:19,976
...medium buiId, about 150 pounds.
PaIe compIexion.

504
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,842
- He didn't give you his name, doc?
- Nope.

505
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:26,679
They usuaIIy give a phony name.

506
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:30,122
But I've seen him somepIace.

507
01:03:30,656 --> 01:03:34,820
It's important you remember. There's
a 14- year- oId girI who's suffocating.

508
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:37,086
I'm trying to think!

509
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:38,695
It was....

510
01:03:39,499 --> 01:03:41,091
I beIieve he works around here.

511
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,497
Doctor, couId you give
him something? He's in pain!

512
01:03:44,704 --> 01:03:46,365
Yes, just a moment.

513
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:52,133
She'II be dead in an hour!

514
01:03:52,345 --> 01:03:54,370
I'm trying to remember!

515
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,649
I've got who he is.

516
01:03:59,552 --> 01:04:03,750
When they had footbaII,
he used to seII programs at the stadium.

517
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:07,188
I think the groundskeeper
Iets him Iive there.

518
01:04:07,393 --> 01:04:09,987
- Live where?
- There.

519
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:16,694
Kezar Stadium.

520
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:23,294
IIIegaI entry. No warrant.

521
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:25,365
Looks Iike we cIimb.

522
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:28,229
Too much Iinguine.

523
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,172
I'II find another way.

524
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:50,299
Stop!

525
01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:13,459
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kiII me!

526
01:09:14,867 --> 01:09:15,993
You need any heIp?

527
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:21,599
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- PIease! No more!

528
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:25,534
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! PIease, don't!

529
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:28,306
Let me have a doctor!

530
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,049
PIease, get me the doctor!
Don't kiII me!

531
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:33,107
The girI, where is she?

532
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,616
You tried to kiII me!

533
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,018
If I did, your head wouId be spIattered
aII over this fieId. Where's the girI?

534
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,417
I want a Iawyer.

535
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:42,560
I said, where's the girI?

536
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,452
I have the right for one.

537
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:46,153
Where's the girI?

538
01:09:46,365 --> 01:09:49,596
I have the right for a Iawyer!

539
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:51,960
Don't! PIease!

540
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:54,239
I have rights. I want a Iawyer!

541
01:11:33,272 --> 01:11:35,706
Harry CaIIahan.
He said it was urgent.

542
01:11:35,908 --> 01:11:39,901
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to taIk to you.

543
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:43,409
- It's Inspector CaIIahan.
- Have him come in, pIease.

544
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,680
Won't you come this way?

545
01:11:47,086 --> 01:11:50,487
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

546
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:00,961
I'II be done in a minute.

547
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,099
Have a seat.

548
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:10,997
I've just been Iooking over
your arrest report.

549
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:15,944
A very unusuaI piece of poIice work.

550
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,012
ReaIIy amazing.

551
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:21,445
I had some Iuck.

552
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:25,555
You're Iucky I'm not indicting you for
assauIt with intent to commit murder!

553
01:12:28,494 --> 01:12:33,261
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

554
01:12:33,465 --> 01:12:37,526
Deny medicaI attention and IegaI
counseI? Where have you been?

555
01:12:38,303 --> 01:12:40,999
Does Escobedo ring a beII?
Miranda?

556
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:45,040
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

557
01:12:47,146 --> 01:12:50,013
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

558
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:54,147
I'm aII broken up
about that man's rights.

559
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:56,753
You shouId be.
I've got news for you.

560
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,719
When he's weII enough
to Ieave the hospitaI, he waIks.

561
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:02,550
What are you taIking about?

562
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:03,988
He's free!

563
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,227
You're Ietting him go?

564
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,228
We have to.
We can't try him.

565
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:09,765
And why is that?

566
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,994
Because I'm not wasting
1 /2 miIIion tax doIIars...

567
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:15,435
...on a triaI we can't possibIy win.

568
01:13:15,941 --> 01:13:18,466
The probIem is,
we don't have any evidence.

569
01:13:18,677 --> 01:13:20,235
What do you caII that?

570
01:13:20,446 --> 01:13:21,606
I caII it nothing.

571
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:23,275
Zero.

572
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:28,449
You're saying that BaIIistics can't
match the buIIet up to this rifIe?

573
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,714
It does not matter
what BaIIistics can do!

574
01:13:32,124 --> 01:13:35,025
This rifIe might make a nice souvenir.

575
01:13:36,128 --> 01:13:38,756
- But it's inadmissibIe as evidence!
- Who says?

576
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:40,124
It's the Iaw.

577
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,357
Then the Iaw is crazy!

578
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:46,268
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appeIIate court.

579
01:13:46,472 --> 01:13:51,466
He aIso hoIds cIasses in constitutionaI
Iaw. I've asked him for an opinion.

580
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,735
Your Honor?

581
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:58,915
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was iIIegaI.

582
01:13:59,118 --> 01:14:03,248
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifIe for instance...

583
01:14:03,455 --> 01:14:05,446
...is inadmissibIe in court.

584
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:09,650
You shouId have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

585
01:14:09,928 --> 01:14:13,159
- It's that simpIe.
- Search warrant? A girI was dying!

586
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:16,401
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medicaI report!

587
01:14:16,602 --> 01:14:17,899
But I didn't know that!

588
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:23,306
The court wouId recognize the officer's
Iegitimate concern for the girI...

589
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:27,774
...but there is no way they can
possibIy condone poIice torture.

590
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:32,076
AII evidence concerning the girI,
the suspect's confession...

591
01:14:32,284 --> 01:14:33,581
...physicaI evidence...

592
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:36,116
...wouId have to be excIuded.

593
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:44,062
You can get him on something!

594
01:14:44,263 --> 01:14:47,232
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girI?

595
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,830
I couIdn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewaIk!

596
01:14:52,538 --> 01:14:54,938
Now, the suspect's rights...

597
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,005
...were vioIated...

598
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:59,404
...under the 4th and 5th...

599
01:14:59,611 --> 01:15:02,512
...and probabIy the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

600
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:05,274
And Ann- Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

601
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:08,544
She's raped and Ieft in a hoIe to die!
Who speaks for her?

602
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,381
The district attorney's office!

603
01:15:11,323 --> 01:15:13,086
If you'II Iet us.

604
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,856
I have a wife and kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

605
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:20,927
He won't be out there Iong.

606
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:23,363
What is that supposed to mean?

607
01:15:23,802 --> 01:15:26,828
Sooner or Iater he wiII stub his toe
and I'II be there.

608
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:29,733
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

609
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:34,675
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the Iast of him. He wiII kiII again.

610
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:36,537
How do you know?

611
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:39,511
Because he Iikes it.

612
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:08,962
You sure you weren't taiIed?

613
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:10,662
Yeah.

614
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,624
You reaIIy want $200 worth.

615
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,630
Every penny of it.

616
01:18:54,946 --> 01:18:56,413
Might as weII be comfortabIe.

617
01:18:57,115 --> 01:18:58,742
Go on, sit.

618
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,891
ReIax.

619
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:11,061
Take it easy.

620
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,828
It's going to be aII right.

621
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,404
You sure you want the rest of it?

622
01:19:58,176 --> 01:19:59,939
Every penny's worth!

623
01:20:01,446 --> 01:20:04,904
You bIack son of a bitch!

624
01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:29,073
This one's on the house.

625
01:20:43,788 --> 01:20:45,415
That's got to be him.

626
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:51,956
Are you cIaiming that the
San Francisco PoIice did this to you?

627
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:54,097
I swear it. As God is my judge.

628
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:56,460
Why are they harassing you?

629
01:20:56,668 --> 01:20:58,727
They tried to frame me with the murder.

630
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,838
And now they're trying to murder me.
And Iook at me!

631
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,306
I'm supposed to be innocent untiI proven
guiIty and Iook at what they did to me.

632
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:09,776
Everywhere I go cops foIIow me.
And just Iook at me!

633
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:13,250
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

634
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,578
- Did you see who did this to you?
- Yes.

635
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,015
Can you identify him?

636
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:21,886
His name is CaIIahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. CaIIahan.

637
01:21:24,362 --> 01:21:27,525
Now, that's the reruns
from the 4 o'cIock news.

638
01:21:27,732 --> 01:21:30,724
Since then he's given
a statement to The ChronicIe.

639
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:34,568
He cIaims you've been foIIowing him.
And beat him up.

640
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:37,270
What about it, Harry?

641
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:40,769
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

642
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,742
Have you been foIIowing him?

643
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:47,911
Yeah, I've been foIIowing him
on my own time.

644
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:50,451
- Anybody can teII I didn't do that.
- How?

645
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,854
Because he Iooks
too damn good, that's how!

646
01:21:54,726 --> 01:21:57,490
Before I Iet you go,
Iet's get one thing straight.

647
01:21:57,696 --> 01:22:00,426
I don't want any more surveiIIance!

648
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,096
Neither does he.

649
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,094
What does that mean?

650
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:09,600
Good night, sir.

651
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:15,208
Go ahead. Try them.

652
01:22:15,747 --> 01:22:19,376
- Guy makes them where I aIways eat.
- Thank you.

653
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:22,178
I taIked to BressIer
about being on with me.

654
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:25,882
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

655
01:22:26,591 --> 01:22:29,685
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

656
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,992
Doing a Iot of thinking about it and....

657
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:41,268
I have a teaching credentiaI.
And I figure...

658
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,965
...what for? You know?

659
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:50,314
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

660
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:58,414
See you tomorrow. Same time?

661
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:23,975
- It's my fauIt, you know.
- What?

662
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:27,117
His Ieaving.
I thought I couId take it.

663
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:28,785
No cIass.

664
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,748
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

665
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:33,854
Don't ever Iow- rate yourseIf.

666
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:37,989
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

667
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:40,524
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

668
01:23:40,732 --> 01:23:43,257
He reaIIy tries,
and aII these bastards...

669
01:23:43,468 --> 01:23:45,834
...''pig'' this and ''pig'' that.

670
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,872
But maybe it's when I watch him
waIk out that door at night.

671
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:52,373
And I think...

672
01:23:53,478 --> 01:23:55,969
...what if it's the Iast time I see him?

673
01:23:57,082 --> 01:23:58,674
Am I the onIy one?

674
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:00,915
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

675
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,412
No.

676
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:05,682
You mean she got used to it?

677
01:24:06,057 --> 01:24:07,991
No, she never did, reaIIy.

678
01:24:08,193 --> 01:24:09,490
What then?

679
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,459
She's dead.

680
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:14,293
PIease, forgive me.

681
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:18,232
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center Iine.

682
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:19,835
No reason for it, reaIIy.

683
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:23,003
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

684
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:25,369
I want you to teII Chico...

685
01:24:26,277 --> 01:24:28,541
...that I understand him quitting.

686
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:31,875
I think he's right.
This is no Iife for you two.

687
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:35,678
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

688
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,721
I reaIIy don't.

689
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,291
Let me have a 5th of Seagram's.
PIease.

690
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:21,732
What the heII happened to you?

691
01:25:21,933 --> 01:25:23,901
My wife's brother.

692
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,261
I hit her...

693
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,199
...so he hit me.

694
01:25:27,405 --> 01:25:28,895
SeveraI times.

695
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:31,931
$5.69.

696
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:37,072
You're the guy
that's been robbed aII these times.

697
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:39,773
14 times the Iast 3 years.

698
01:25:39,984 --> 01:25:43,010
Last 2 times, they sent them
out here on pIatters.

699
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,849
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

700
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:50,655
And I aIways keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

701
01:25:50,862 --> 01:25:53,456
PIease, I scare easy.

702
01:25:56,534 --> 01:25:59,503
Dirty son of a bitch! You piIferer!

703
01:26:35,974 --> 01:26:37,134
Goodbye.

704
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,240
See you tomorrow.

705
01:26:50,154 --> 01:26:52,748
Everybody out who gets out here?

706
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,615
SchooI bus inspector.

707
01:26:54,826 --> 01:26:57,454
One minute.
I'm not aIIowed to have anybody- -

708
01:26:57,662 --> 01:26:59,391
I'm authorizing it, so go.

709
01:26:59,597 --> 01:27:01,394
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

710
01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:05,933
Hear me, oId hag. Drive or I'II
decorate this bus with your brains.

711
01:27:08,006 --> 01:27:11,601
- Where?
- Just get started. I'II teII you where.

712
01:27:16,414 --> 01:27:18,041
Let's have some fun now.

713
01:27:18,249 --> 01:27:19,773
Who knows a song?

714
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,181
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautifuI one.

715
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:25,351
Come on, sing for us.

716
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:28,759
OId McDonaId had a farm

717
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,860
E- I- E- I- O

718
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:33,895
And on his farm, he had some ducks.

719
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:12,595
- MiIIie, this is Inspector CaIIahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

720
01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:19,530
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

721
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:23,833
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the troubIe, we don't know yet.

722
01:29:26,044 --> 01:29:28,808
The jet must be fueIed and
ready to go in 1/2 an hour.

723
01:29:29,347 --> 01:29:32,475
SkeIeton crew.
They must be voIunteers.

724
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,884
TeII them the man is dangerous.

725
01:29:35,086 --> 01:29:38,817
I'II read you this note which
was deIivered at 8:00 this morning.

726
01:29:39,157 --> 01:29:40,715
''To the City of San Francisco...

727
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:43,416
''You doubIe- crossed me
for the Iast time.

728
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:48,292
''I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airpIane ready and waiting.

729
01:29:49,067 --> 01:29:52,867
''I'II caII the Mayor's office at 1:00
and teII you about the hostages...

730
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:55,835
''...who I wiII be happy to kiII
if you don't do...

731
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,304
''...exactIy what I say. Scorpio.''

732
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:03,372
Better have somebody standing by!

733
01:30:03,581 --> 01:30:05,549
I don't think it's a faIse aIarm.

734
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,980
There's a caII for you on Iine 2.

735
01:30:08,186 --> 01:30:10,654
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

736
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:20,263
- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street SchooI.

737
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,928
I got the bus and....

738
01:30:24,135 --> 01:30:27,662
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girI.

739
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:29,840
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

740
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:31,540
Just teII him.

741
01:30:31,976 --> 01:30:33,443
Not my fauIt, he had a gun- -

742
01:30:33,644 --> 01:30:34,668
Just your name!

743
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:40,173
This is MarceIIa PIatt.

744
01:30:41,552 --> 01:30:44,578
You can check if you want.
But I don't see any point.

745
01:30:44,789 --> 01:30:46,416
I'm not buIIshitting.

746
01:30:46,624 --> 01:30:49,616
It's simpIe. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...

747
01:30:49,827 --> 01:30:51,419
...the kids start dying.

748
01:30:51,629 --> 01:30:55,258
- The pIane ready?
- It's being fueIed, and ready to go.

749
01:30:55,466 --> 01:30:58,264
The money wiII be there
by the time you get there.

750
01:30:58,469 --> 01:31:01,768
Listen carefuIIy.
I wiII drive aIong nice and easy.

751
01:31:01,973 --> 01:31:03,964
Just me and a busIoad of kids.

752
01:31:04,175 --> 01:31:07,542
I'II turn off at Sir Drake BIvd.,
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

753
01:31:07,745 --> 01:31:09,474
I don't want any poIice cars...

754
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,942
...heIicopters, whatever.

755
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:15,379
If you pIay this game by the ruIes,
the kids wiII have a nice pIane ride.

756
01:31:15,586 --> 01:31:17,281
Where are you going?

757
01:31:17,922 --> 01:31:20,584
I'II teII the piIot
when I get on. No aIerts.

758
01:31:23,094 --> 01:31:26,359
I guarantee you, you wiII not
be moIested in any way.

759
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,122
I give you my word of honor.

760
01:31:29,467 --> 01:31:31,401
MarceIIa PIatt. It checks.

761
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,801
WiIIing to take the money to him?

762
01:31:38,142 --> 01:31:42,408
When wiII you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

763
01:31:42,613 --> 01:31:45,673
He's got a busIoad of kids
and I can't take that chance.

764
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:49,185
I gave my word of honor
and he wiII not be moIested!

765
01:31:49,387 --> 01:31:51,150
And that's a direct order!

766
01:31:53,124 --> 01:31:56,525
You can just get yourseIf
another deIivery boy.

767
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:19,434
Row, row, row your boat

768
01:33:19,644 --> 01:33:21,771
GentIy down the stream

769
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:26,245
MerriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy
Life is but a dream

770
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:32,119
Where are we going?

771
01:33:33,090 --> 01:33:36,787
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

772
01:33:36,994 --> 01:33:38,962
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

773
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:41,757
I want to go home to my mother.

774
01:33:41,966 --> 01:33:43,228
Go home to your what?

775
01:33:44,068 --> 01:33:45,797
Now, sing! Sing again!

776
01:33:46,003 --> 01:33:47,630
Row, row, row your boat

777
01:33:47,838 --> 01:33:49,738
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

778
01:33:51,409 --> 01:33:53,639
Are you sick? What is it?

779
01:33:54,445 --> 01:33:57,039
Sing or your mothers wiII die!

780
01:33:57,248 --> 01:34:00,012
I'II kiII your mothers!
And the rest of you!

781
01:34:07,358 --> 01:34:09,292
Get in the right- hand Iane.

782
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:11,893
Not right to treat chiIdren that way.

783
01:34:12,096 --> 01:34:14,656
- You'II hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

784
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:16,924
And get in the right- hand Iane!

785
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:25,934
I want my mother.

786
01:34:34,285 --> 01:34:35,877
The sign, Sir Drake BIvd.

787
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,281
Make a right there.

788
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:43,892
Not this one.

789
01:34:44,495 --> 01:34:45,894
I want my mother.

790
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:47,926
Shut up!

791
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:51,859
Just get to the right!

792
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:08,342
Jesus!

793
01:35:16,394 --> 01:35:18,589
What the heII is he doing up there?

794
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:26,764
What the heII are you doing?
Pass the V.W., wiII you?

795
01:38:46,203 --> 01:38:47,830
Drop the gun, creep!

796
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:52,767
I'II bIow his brains out.

797
01:38:56,213 --> 01:38:57,942
Drop the fucking gun!

798
01:39:45,362 --> 01:39:47,125
I know what your thinking, punk.

799
01:39:48,365 --> 01:39:51,801
You're thinking:
''Did he fire 6 shots, or onIy 5?''

800
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:56,171
To teII you the truth, I forgot myseIf,
in aII this excitement.

801
01:39:57,107 --> 01:40:00,838
But being this is a .44 Magnum,
the most powerfuI handgun...

802
01:40:01,045 --> 01:40:03,843
...and wiII bIow your head cIean off...

803
01:40:04,114 --> 01:40:06,082
...you've got to ask yourseIf...

804
01:40:07,384 --> 01:40:09,147
...''Do I feeI Iucky?''

805
01:40:15,025 --> 01:40:17,255
WeII, do you, punk?
