1
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,430
Jesus!

2
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,930
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,560
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,850
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,230
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
<i>...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...</i>

7
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,570
...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,450
If I do not hear from you...

9
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,330
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a... "

10
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,290
"Scorpio. "

11
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,210
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,710
Kooks.

13
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,880
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,590
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,720
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,850
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,270
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

19
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,870
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,450
Callahan?

21
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,420
All right.

23
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,830
Let's have it.

24
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,380
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

25
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,260
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,430
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

27
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,560
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,350
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,620
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,120
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,420
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,260
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,710
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,550
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,840
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,680
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,480
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,020
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,650
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,770
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

41
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,650
We're running a computer check...

42
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,740
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,530
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Why?

45
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,830
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,040
Thank you, inspector.

47
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,630
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

48
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,670
How about you?

49
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,130
Nobody.

50
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,220
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

51
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,720
Nobody.

52
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,020
<i>All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.</i>

53
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,560
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,770
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,770
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,820
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,110
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,910
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,830
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,870
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,380
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,640
That's my policy.

64
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,180
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,730
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,610
Intent?

67
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,520
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,200
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,910
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,620
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,510
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

72
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,270
Usual.

73
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,520
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,270
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,520
Not much.

76
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,490
Hey, Jaffe...

77
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,490
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,830
Tan Ford?

79
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,960
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,000
Engine running?

81
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,050
I don't know.
How can I tell?

82
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,840
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

83
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,090
Look at that pollution.

84
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,180
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,230
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,230
Police Department?

87
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,230
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,820
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,610
Got it.

90
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,120
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,160
In progress.
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,340
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

93
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,550
Shit!

94
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,570
Halt!

95
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,400
I know what you're thinking.

96
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,990
Did he fire six shots or only five?

97
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,370
To tell the truth, in the excitement
I kind of lost track myself.

98
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,870
This is a. 44 Magnum, the most
powerful handgun in the world...

99
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,420
...and would blow
your head clean off...

100
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,920
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

101
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,800
Well, do you, punk?

102
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,780
I got to know.

103
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,760
Son of a bitch!

104
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,180
It looks like we can save that leg.

105
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,350
I've got a couple under my knee.

106
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,350
Ever consider
another line of work?

107
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,020
I really appreciate this, Steve.

108
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,730
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

109
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,610
Nothing fancy, now.

110
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,450
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

111
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

112
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,250
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

113
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,130
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

114
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,460
Sorry, Harry.

115
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,420
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

116
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,930
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

117
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,680
For $29.50, let it hurt.

118
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,470
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

119
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,600
- Good morning, inspector.
- Maria.

120
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,940
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

121
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,280
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

122
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,410
Whenever you do.

123
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,750
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a. m.
Checking the search patterns.

124
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,290
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

125
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,750
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

126
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,130
- He was?
- He said to say, "Well done!"

127
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
I can't tell you how moved I am.

128
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,680
I pass along a compliment...

129
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,810
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

130
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,020
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

131
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,560
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

132
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,770
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

133
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,530
I'm putting somebody
with you.

134
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,280
- What are you talking about?
- You need a partner.

135
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,080
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

136
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,920
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

137
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,840
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

138
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,170
I have no time to break in newcomers.

139
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,630
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

140
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,100
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

141
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,640
...and Fanduchi's dead.

142
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,140
So?

143
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,940
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

144
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,400
What about De Georgio?

145
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,940
No way!

146
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,360
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

147
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,650
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

148
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,830
I got it.

149
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,000
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

150
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,000
You from around here?

151
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,380
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

152
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,090
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

153
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,260
Just what I need is a college boy.

154
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,430
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

155
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,890
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

156
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,690
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.

157
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,110
I intend to.

158
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,530
Inspector Callahan.

159
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,490
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

160
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,030
I'll remember that.

161
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,240
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

162
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,370
You're a sweet man, Harry.

163
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,960
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

164
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

165
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,430
That's one thing about our Harry.

166
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,930
Doesn't play favorites.

167
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,720
Harry hates everybody: Limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

168
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,520
You name it.

169
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,730
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

170
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,440
Especially spics.

171
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,370
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

172
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,540
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

173
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,020
<i>You, on the roof!</i>

174
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,060
<i>You, there!</i>

175
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,020
<i>Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.</i>

176
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,030
<i>Turn around
and put your hands in the air.</i>

177
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,590
<i>I don't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!</i>

178
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,840
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

179
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,890
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

180
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,760
That's possible.

181
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,480
<i>- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.</i>

182
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,450
<i>Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.</i>

183
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,820
<i>He is an adult male.</i>

184
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,740
<i>Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.</i>

185
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,290
<i>When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...</i>

186
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,380
<i>...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.</i>

187
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,960
<i>He had a tan suitcase...</i>

188
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,460
<i>...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...</i>

189
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,130
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

190
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,260
I know what you mean.

191
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,310
- There!
- What?

192
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,230
Tan suitcase.

193
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,900
- Where?
- I lost him.

194
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,570
There he goes, over there.

195
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,150
Does that bag look tan?

196
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,650
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

197
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,610
Go to Filbert and hang a left.

198
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,450
Look out for these people!

199
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,830
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

200
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,340
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

201
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,800
I saw him.

202
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,670
- There he is.
- I see him.

203
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,300
<i>Car 2, the license number...</i>

204
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,390
<i>...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.</i>

205
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,650
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go here.

206
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,820
<i>Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?</i>

207
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,530
<i>Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.</i>

208
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,410
<i>10-4.</i>

209
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,630
<i>You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.</i>

210
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,330
Anybody home?

211
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,600
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

212
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,040
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

213
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,090
You getting an eyeful?

214
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,550
You goddamn pie hawker!

215
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,180
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

216
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,850
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

217
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,690
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

218
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,610
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

219
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,030
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

220
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,200
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

221
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,870
Beat it. Get out of here.

222
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,750
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

223
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,920
I just had another thought.

224
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,630
Yeah? About what?

225
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,350
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

226
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,900
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

227
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,570
<i>Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.</i>

228
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,990
<i>Inspector 71.
Do you read me?</i>

229
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,120
<i>- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.</i>

230
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,080
<i>California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.</i>

231
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,080
10-4. We're on our way.

232
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,440
It's some idiot.

233
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,770
Where? I don't see him.

234
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,730
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

235
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,410
<i>I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.</i>

236
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,910
<i>In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.</i>

237
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,960
<i>California license D-dog,
C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.</i>

238
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,590
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

239
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,440
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

240
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,490
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

241
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,810
Don't you try to get me!

242
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,730
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

243
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,030
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

244
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,290
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

245
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,540
Won't you try to grab me?

246
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,670
A friend of mine was up about 20
floors with a jumper a few years ago.

247
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,130
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

248
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,420
Mashed all over.

249
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,890
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

250
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,430
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

251
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,270
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

252
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,770
It's a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

253
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,150
Even if they find
your driver's license!

254
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,780
All that blood!

255
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,660
I think I'm going to puke!

256
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,580
Don't do that, son. All those people
down there looking up.

257
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,750
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

258
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,630
You bastard!

259
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,090
Get the stretcher up here.

260
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,190
Now you know why I'm called
Dirty Harry.

261
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,820
Every dirty job that comes along.

262
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,670
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

263
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,210
This is Inspector 71.

264
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,010
<i>Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.</i>

265
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,430
What about him?

266
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,430
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

267
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,390
Anybody know who the boy is?

268
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,770
His name was Charlie Russell.

269
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,650
I'm his mother.

270
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,400
He's only 10 years old.

271
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,960
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

272
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,340
You'd better go check on the mother.

273
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,970
What do you have?

274
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,270
<i>That 30-06 shell casing.</i>

275
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,310
<i>He was up here all right.</i>

276
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,570
Welcome to Homicide.

277
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,090
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

278
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,600
...has to sell these for a living!

279
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,480
.458 Magnum?

280
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,480
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

281
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

282
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,820
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

283
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,700
What have you got, lieutenant?

284
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,330
The blue flags represent the units that
will be on duty by dark tonight.

285
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,830
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

286
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,880
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

287
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,220
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

288
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,010
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

289
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,930
We're saving that for him.

290
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,760
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

291
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,100
It's a building that overlooks the
roof where they spotted him yesterday.

292
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,350
Something bothering you?

293
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,480
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

294
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,820
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

295
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,240
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

296
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,990
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

297
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,120
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

298
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,210
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

299
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,960
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

300
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,550
Scorpio strikes again.

301
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,180
They like that feeling.

302
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,010
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

303
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,310
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

304
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,690
And they're having a novena tonight.

305
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,520
Go on.

306
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,070
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

307
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,940
The Russell boy was black.

308
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,950
<i>He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.</i>

309
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,220
Inspector 71.

310
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,890
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

311
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,990
How about the priest?

312
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,540
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

313
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,790
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

314
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,500
Who?

315
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,460
Never guess.

316
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,140
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

317
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,770
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

318
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,370
Son of a bitch took the bait!

319
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,670
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

320
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,540
Now!

321
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,380
- You all right?
- I think so.

322
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,770
Call an ambulance.

323
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,060
Collins never knew what hit him.

324
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,700
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

325
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,200
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

326
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,500
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

327
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,920
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

328
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,750
Ann Mary Deacon.

329
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,630
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

330
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,510
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

331
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,560
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive. "

332
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,230
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

333
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,360
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

334
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,320
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

335
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,360
One man with yellow bag.

336
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,450
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

337
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,120
9 p. m.

338
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,540
She has oxygen
till 3 a. m. Tomorrow.

339
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,410
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

340
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,460
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

341
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,300
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio. "

342
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Anything else?

343
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,930
The mother identified the bra...

344
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,800
...the hank of hair...

345
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,350
...and that.

346
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,220
The dentist identified that.

347
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,650
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

348
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,860
You know she's dead.

349
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,490
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a. m.

350
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,240
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

351
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,700
He's using up a lot of favors.

352
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,460
He wants to pay.

353
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,710
No tricks.

354
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,760
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

355
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:38,890
You got it.

356
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,220
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p. m.
- All right.

357
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,100
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

358
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,100
No cover?
Not even one man?

359
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,860
Sure that's how to do it?

360
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,030
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

361
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,410
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

362
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,450
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

363
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,420
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

364
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,540
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

365
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,100
Testing 1, 2, 3...

366
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,730
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

367
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,940
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow. "

368
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,770
Okay, that's better.

369
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,940
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

370
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,570
...forget it.

371
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,990
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

372
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,410
Bring it back in one piece.

373
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,330
$200,000.

374
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,580
Count it and sign for it.

375
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,130
Did you count it out?

376
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,470
Did you count it, chief?

377
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,470
It's not my responsibility.

378
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,140
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

379
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,190
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

380
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,280
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

381
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,910
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

382
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,290
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

383
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,630
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

384
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,180
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

385
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,930
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

386
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:03,450
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

387
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,810
<i>- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.</i>

388
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,400
<i>- What's your name?
- Callahan.</i>

389
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,280
<i>- What are you?
- Police officer.</i>

390
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,240
Hello?

391
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
<i>All right, police officer...</i>

392
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,040
<i>...this is how we play.</i>

393
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,460
<i>I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.</i>

394
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,090
<i>If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.</i>

395
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,470
<i>If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...</i>

396
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:52,220
<i>...the girl dies.</i>

397
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,560
<i>- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.</i>

398
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,150
<i>No car.</i>

399
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,320
<i>I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.</i>

400
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,150
<i>I ring 4 times.
You don't answer by the fourth ring...</i>

401
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,410
<i>...that's the end of the game.</i>

402
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,450
<i>The girl dies.</i>

403
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,580
<i>What time you got?</i>

404
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,870
<i>- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.</i>

405
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,170
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

406
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,420
<i>Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.</i>

407
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,880
<i>Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?</i>

408
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,690
<i>- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.</i>

409
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,600
<i>Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.</i>

410
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,610
<i>Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.</i>

411
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,280
<i>You sound like you had a good rest.</i>

412
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:35,320
<i>You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.</i>

413
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,950
<i>You better make it,
because if you don't, dead girl!</i>

414
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,410
<i>Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.</i>

415
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,750
<i>Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.</i>

416
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,290
What's in the bag, man?

417
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,750
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

418
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,380
Just give us the wallet.

419
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,880
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

420
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,700
Don't answer that!

421
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,300
<i>- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.</i>

422
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,850
<i>Chico, he hung up.</i>

423
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,640
<i>- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.</i>

424
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,150
<i>Go to the cross.</i>

425
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,560
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

426
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,610
<i>I'm going up.</i>

427
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,040
I see a couple of people.

428
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,250
Just a couple of kids necking.

429
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,920
Boys or girls?

430
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm Callahan.

431
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,740
My friends call me Alice.

432
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,780
And I will take a dare.

433
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,950
When was the last time
you were busted?

434
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,540
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

435
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,420
Well, do it at home.

436
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,150
Freeze!

437
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,030
Just like a statue.

438
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,490
That's right.

439
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,160
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

440
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:33,120
I'll kill you and the girl both.

441
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,120
Understand?

442
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,830
Yeah.

443
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,710
Drop the bag.

444
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,670
Left hand.

445
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,840
Let's see the gun.

446
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,600
My!

447
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,730
That's a big one.

448
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,190
Left hand. Throw it.

449
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,730
Easy.

450
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,450
Raise your hands.

451
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,450
Come on, get them up.

452
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,500
Now turn.

453
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,540
Face the cross.

454
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,250
Come on.

455
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,300
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

456
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,410
You lift that hand once more and I
won't let you know where the girl is!

457
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,660
Do we understand each other?

458
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,950
Do we understand each other?

459
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,370
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

460
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,250
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

461
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,670
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

462
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,250
Do we understand each other?

463
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,680
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

464
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,140
Listen to me carefully.

465
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,930
I've changed my mind.

466
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,180
I'm going to let her die.

467
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,400
I just wanted you to know that.

468
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,360
<i>You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.</i>

469
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,290
Goodbye, Callahan!

470
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,510
Chico, don't kill him!

471
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,920
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, chief.

472
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,550
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

473
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,420
He's right here.

474
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,260
He's got two cracked ribs.

475
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,300
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

476
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,720
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

477
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,230
I'm sending him home.

478
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,810
Right, chief.

479
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,690
He says beat it! That's an order.

480
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,400
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

481
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,280
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

482
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:22,700
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

483
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,580
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

484
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,540
What am I going to tell him?

485
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,420
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

486
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,260
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

487
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,180
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

488
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,850
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

489
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,600
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

490
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,780
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

491
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,700
- Put him on.
- What is it?

492
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:07,580
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

493
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,330
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

494
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,710
Long blond hair...

495
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,920
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

496
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,760
Pale complexion.

497
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,600
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

498
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,430
They usually give a phony name.

499
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:29,890
But I've seen him someplace.

500
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,560
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

501
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,820
I'm trying to think!

502
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:38,440
It was...

503
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,950
I believe he works around here.

504
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,240
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

505
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,160
Yes, just a moment.

506
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,870
She'll be dead in an hour!

507
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,170
I'm trying to remember!

508
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,460
I've got who he is.

509
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,550
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

510
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,890
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

511
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,850
- Live where?
- There.

512
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,440
Kezar Stadium.

513
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,050
Illegal entry. No warrant.

514
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,130
Looks like we climb.

515
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,010
Too much linguine.

516
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,930
I'll find another way.

517
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,090
Stop!

518
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:13,240
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

519
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,780
You need any help?

520
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,370
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

521
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:25,330
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

522
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,040
Let me have a doctor!

523
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,840
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

524
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,960
The girl, where is she?

525
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,380
You tried to kill me!

526
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:38,800
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

527
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,220
I want a lawyer.

528
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,350
I said, where's the girl?

529
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,850
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

530
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,360
I have the right to a lawyer!

531
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,780
Don't! Please!

532
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:54,570
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

533
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,420
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

534
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,670
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

535
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:43,180
<i>- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.</i>

536
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,430
Won't you come this way?

537
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:50,270
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

538
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,740
I'll be done in a minute.

539
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,860
Have a seat.

540
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:10,790
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

541
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,750
A very unusual piece of police work.

542
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,800
Really amazing.

543
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,300
I had some luck.

544
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:25,350
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

545
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:33,100
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

546
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:37,320
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

547
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:40,780
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

548
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,490
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

549
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:49,790
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

550
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,040
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

551
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,590
You should be.
I've got news for you.

552
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,500
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

553
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,340
What are you talking about?

554
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,760
He's free!

555
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,970
You're letting him go?

556
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,010
We have to.
We can't try him.

557
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,510
And why is that?

558
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,770
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

559
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,270
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

560
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:18,270
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

561
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,400
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

562
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,070
Zero.

563
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:28,280
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

564
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:31,540
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

565
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,830
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

566
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,500
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

567
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:39,920
It's the law.

568
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,130
Then the law is crazy!

569
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:46,130
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

570
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:51,220
He holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

571
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,560
Your Honor?

572
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:58,690
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

573
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,110
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

574
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,240
...is inadmissible in court.

575
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:09,450
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

576
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,950
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

577
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,250
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

578
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,670
But I didn't know that!

579
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,090
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

580
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:27,550
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

581
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:31,850
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

582
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,350
...physical evidence...

583
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,890
...would have to be excluded.

584
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,860
There must be something
you can get him on!

585
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:47,070
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

586
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,620
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

587
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:54,740
Now, the suspect's rights...

588
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,790
...were violated...

589
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,210
...under the 4th and 5th...

590
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,250
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

591
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,050
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

592
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,380
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

593
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,180
The district attorney's office!

594
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,890
If you'll let us.

595
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,640
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

596
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,730
He won't be out there long.

597
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,150
What is that supposed to mean?

598
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,610
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

599
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,530
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

600
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,450
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

601
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,330
How do you know?

602
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,370
Because he likes it.

603
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,650
You sure you weren't tailed?

604
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,400
Yeah.

605
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,340
You really want $200 worth.

606
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,350
Every penny of it.

607
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,110
Might as well be comfortable.

608
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,450
Go on, sit.

609
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,660
Relax.

610
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,830
Take it easy.

611
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:13,550
It's going to be all right.

612
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,130
You sure you want the rest of it?

613
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,630
Every penny's worth!

614
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:04,640
You black son of a bitch!

615
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,790
This one's on the house.

616
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:44,970
That's got to be him.

617
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,690
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

618
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:53,850
I swear it. As God is my judge.

619
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,230
Why are they harassing you?

620
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,480
They tried to frame me with the murder.

621
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:01,610
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

622
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,030
I'm innocent until proven guilty
and look at what they did to me.

623
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,490
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

624
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,040
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

625
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,290
Did you see who did this to you?

626
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:16,710
Can you identify him?

627
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,590
<i>His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.</i>

628
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:27,180
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

629
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:30,390
<i>Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.</i>

630
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:34,190
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

631
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,940
What about it, Harry?

632
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,360
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

633
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,360
Have you been following him?

634
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,490
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

635
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:50,160
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

636
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,620
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

637
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,130
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

638
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,050
I don't want any more surveillance!

639
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,760
Neither does he.

640
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,800
What does that mean?

641
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,220
Good night, sir.

642
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,850
Go ahead. Try them.

643
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,980
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

644
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,940
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

645
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,610
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

646
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,320
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

647
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:35,620
Doing a lot of thinking
about it and...

648
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:40,920
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

649
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,630
...what for? You know?

650
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:49,930
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

651
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,100
See you tomorrow. Same time?

652
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,710
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

653
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,720
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

654
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,470
No class.

655
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,430
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

656
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,560
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

657
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,810
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

658
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,100
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

659
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,900
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

660
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,480
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

661
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:50,490
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

662
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:51,990
And I think...

663
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,620
...what if it's the last time
I see him?

664
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:58,370
Am I the only one?

665
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,620
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

666
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,040
No.

667
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:05,340
You mean she got used to it?

668
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,630
No, she never did, really.

669
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,170
What, then?

670
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,430
She's dead.

671
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,930
Please, forgive me.

672
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:17,810
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

673
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,520
No reason for it, really.

674
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,650
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

675
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,070
I want you to tell Chico...

676
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:28,150
...that I understand him quitting.

677
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,570
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

678
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,370
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

679
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,410
I really don't.

680
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,950
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

681
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,330
What the hell happened to you?

682
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,540
My wife's brother.

683
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,920
I hit her...

684
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,840
...so he hit me.

685
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:28,590
Several times.

686
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,590
$5.69.

687
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:36,680
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

688
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:39,390
14 times the last 3 years.

689
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,640
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

690
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:45,480
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

691
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:50,440
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

692
01:25:50,650 --> 01:25:53,150
Please, I scare easy.

693
01:25:56,410 --> 01:25:59,120
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

694
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,780
Goodbye.

695
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:39,870
See you tomorrow.

696
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,500
Everybody out who gets out here?

697
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,420
School bus inspector.

698
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:57,260
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

699
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:59,090
I'm authorizing it, so go.

700
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:01,180
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

701
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:05,730
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

702
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:11,440
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

703
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:17,740
Let's have some fun now.

704
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,530
Who knows a song?

705
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,780
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

706
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,080
Come on, sing for us.

707
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:12,350
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

708
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:19,230
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

709
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,610
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

710
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,580
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

711
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,120
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

712
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,580
Tell them the man is dangerous.

713
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:38,630
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

714
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,380
"To the City of San Francisco.

715
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:43,130
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

716
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,100
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

717
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:52,600
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

718
01:29:52,850 --> 01:29:55,440
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

719
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:58,060
...exactly what I say. Scorpio. "

720
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:03,110
Better have somebody standing by!

721
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,280
I don't think it's a false alarm.

722
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:07,740
<i>There's a call for you on line 2.</i>

723
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,410
<i>I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.</i>

724
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,920
<i>- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.</i>

725
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,630
I got the bus and...

726
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:27,390
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

727
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,470
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

728
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:31,260
Just tell him.

729
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:33,180
Not my fault, he had a gun...

730
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,310
Just your name!

731
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,810
<i>This is Marcella Platt.</i>

732
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:44,240
<i>You can check if you want.
But I don't see any point.</i>

733
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:46,030
<i>I'm not bullshitting.</i>

734
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,370
<i>It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...</i>

735
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:51,160
<i>...the kids start dying.</i>

736
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:55,000
<i>- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.</i>

737
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:58,000
<i>The money will be there
by the time you get there.</i>

738
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,380
<i>Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.</i>

739
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:03,590
<i>Just me and a busload of kids.</i>

740
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,130
<i>I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.</i>

741
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,220
<i>I don't want any police cars...</i>

742
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:10,600
<i>...helicopters, whatever.</i>

743
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:15,060
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

744
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:17,060
Where are you going?

745
01:31:17,690 --> 01:31:20,860
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

746
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:25,940
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

747
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,780
I give you my word of honor.

748
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:31,030
Marcella Platt. It checks.

749
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:37,500
Willing to take the money to him?

750
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:42,040
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

751
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,340
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

752
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,930
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

753
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:50,800
And that's a direct order!

754
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:56,220
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

755
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,780
Where are we going?

756
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:36,490
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

757
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,620
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

758
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,450
I want to go home to my mother.

759
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,870
Go home to your what?

760
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,500
Now, sing! Sing again!

761
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,380
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

762
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,300
Are you sick?
What is it?

763
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,720
Sing or your mothers will die!

764
01:33:56,970 --> 01:33:59,680
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

765
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,940
Get in the right-hand lane.

766
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:11,570
Not right to treat children that way.

767
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:14,280
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

768
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,620
And get in the right-hand lane!

769
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,620
I want my mother.

770
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:35,630
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

771
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,930
Make a right there.

772
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,010
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

773
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,560
Not this one.

774
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,560
I want my mother.

775
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:47,900
Shut up!

776
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,520
Just get to the right!

777
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,040
Jesus!

778
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:18,720
What the hell is he doing up there?

779
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,430
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

780
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,510
Drop the gun, creep!

781
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:52,430
I'll blow his brains out.

782
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:57,600
Drop the fucking gun!

783
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:46,780
I know what you're thinking.

784
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:51,530
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

785
01:39:52,490 --> 01:39:55,830
To tell you the truth, I forgot
myself, in all this excitement.

786
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:00,580
But being this is a. 44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world...

787
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:03,500
...and will blow your head
clean off...

788
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,710
...you've got to ask yourself:

789
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,800
"Do I feel lucky?"

790
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:16,930
Well, do you, punk?
