1
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Jesus!

2
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,900
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,400
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,500
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...

7
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,900
...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,700
If I do not hear from you...

9
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,400
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

10
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,100
"Scorpio. "

11
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,900
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,300
Kooks.

13
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,300
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,900
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

19
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,300
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Callahan?

21
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,100
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
All right.

23
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,800
Let's have it.

24
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,300
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

25
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,900
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

27
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,900
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,500
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,600
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,700
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,300
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,700
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,300
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,100
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

41
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
We're running a computer check...

42
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,800
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,500
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,700
Why?

45
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,700
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Thank you, Inspector.

47
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,300
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

48
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,100
How about you?

49
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Nobody.

50
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

51
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Nobody.

52
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,900
All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.

53
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,500
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,500
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,900
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,900
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,900
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,000
That's my policy.

64
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,800
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
Intent?

67
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,800
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,400
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,400
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

72
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,100
Usual.

73
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,900
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Not much.

76
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Hey, Jaffe...

77
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,700
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
Tan Ford?

79
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Engine running?

81
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,700
I don't know.
How can I tell?

82
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,300
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

83
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,500
Look at that pollution.

84
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
Police Department?

87
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,000
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,100
Got it.

90
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,500
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,400
In progress.
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

93
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,200
Shit!

94
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,600
Halt!

95
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,900
I know what you're thinking.

96
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,300
Did he fire six shots or only five?

97
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,500
To tell the truth, in all the excitement
I've kind of lost track myself.

98
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Since this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

99
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,300
...and would blow
your head clean off...

100
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,700
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

101
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Well, do you, punk?

102
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,500
I got to know.

103
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Son of a bitch!

104
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,800
It looks like we can save that leg.

105
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,900
I've got a couple under my knee.

106
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
Ever consider
another line of work?

107
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,300
I really appreciate this, Steve.

108
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,900
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

109
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,700
Nothing fancy, now.

110
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,400
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

111
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,500
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

112
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,900
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

113
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,600
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a... .

114
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,900
Sorry, Harry.

115
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,700
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

116
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,100
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

117
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
For $29.50, let it hurt.

118
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

119
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Maria.

120
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

121
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,100
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

122
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Whenever you do.

123
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
checking the search patterns.

124
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,700
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

125
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,100
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

126
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,300
- He was?
- He wanted me to tell you: "Well done! "

127
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,500
I can't tell you how moved I am.

128
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I pass along a compliment...

129
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,600
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

130
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,700
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

131
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,100
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

132
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,200
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

133
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,900
I'm putting somebody
with you.

134
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
What are you talking about?

135
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
You need a partner.

136
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,900
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

137
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,600
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

138
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,400
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

139
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I have no time to break in newcomers.

140
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,900
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

141
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,200
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

142
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,700
...and Fanduchi's dead.

143
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,100
So?

144
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,700
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

145
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,100
What about De Georgio?

146
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
No way!

147
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,900
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

148
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

149
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,100
I got it.

150
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

151
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,900
You from around here?

152
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

153
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,700
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

154
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Just what I need is a college boy.

155
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,800
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

156
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,100
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

157
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,100
- Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.
- I intend to.

158
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,500
Inspector Callahan.

159
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,300
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

160
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,700
I'll remember that.

161
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,700
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

162
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,700
You're a sweet man, Harry.

163
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

164
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

165
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
That's one thing about our Harry.

166
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,700
Doesn't play favorites.

167
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,300
Harry hates everybody: limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

168
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,100
You name it.

169
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,100
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

170
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,700
Especially spics.

171
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,500
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

172
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

173
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,100
You, on the roof!

174
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
You, there!

175
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,900
Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.

176
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
Turn around
and put your hands in the air.

177
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,500
I don 't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!

178
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,600
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

179
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,500
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

180
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,300
That's possible.

181
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.

182
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,300
Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.

183
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,700
He is an adult male.

184
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.

185
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...

186
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,800
...pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.

187
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,300
He had a tan suitcase...

188
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
...which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...

189
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,100
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

190
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,200
I know what you mean.

191
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
- There!
- What?

192
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,900
Tan suitcase.

193
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
- Where?
- I lost him.

194
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,900
There he goes, over there.

195
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,500
Does that bag look tan?

196
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,900
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

197
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,700
Go to Filber and hang a left.

198
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,500
Look out for these people!

199
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,700
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

200
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,900
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

201
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,300
I saw him.

202
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,100
- There he is.
- I see him.

203
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,500
Car 2, the license number...

204
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,500
...at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.

205
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,300
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go in here.

206
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?

207
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,900
Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.

208
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,700
10-4.

209
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,300
You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.

210
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,900
Anybody home?

211
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

212
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

213
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,500
You getting an eyeful?

214
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,800
You goddamn pie hawker!

215
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,300
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

216
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,600
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

217
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

218
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,900
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

219
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

220
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,300
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

221
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
Beat it. Get out of here.

222
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

223
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,500
I just had another thought.

224
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,100
Yeah? About what?

225
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,700
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

226
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,900
Inspector 71.

227
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.

228
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,700
Inspector 71.
Do you read me?

229
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,600
- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.

230
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,400
California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.

231
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,400
10-4. We're on our way.

232
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
It's some idiot.

233
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Where? I don't see him.

234
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,900
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

235
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,300
I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.

236
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,700
In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.

237
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,500
California license D-dog,
C-Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.

238
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,600
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

239
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,700
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here... .

240
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,700
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

241
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,900
Don't you try to get me!

242
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,700
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

243
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

244
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,800
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

245
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Won't you try to grab me?

246
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,900
A friend of mine was up about 20 floors
with a jumper a few years ago.

247
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,300
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

248
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,500
Mashed all over.

249
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,700
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which... .

250
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,100
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

251
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,800
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

252
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,100
It's such a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

253
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,000
Even if they find your driver's license!
All that blood!

254
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,600
I think I'm going to puke!

255
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,400
Don't do that, son.
All those people down there looking up.

256
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,500
The fire chief looking up.
With his face... .

257
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,300
You bastard!

258
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,700
Get the stretcher up here.

259
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,300
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry.
Every dirty job that comes along.

260
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Inspector 71.

261
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,400
This is Inspector 71.

262
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,000
Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

263
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,300
What about him?

264
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

265
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Anybody know who the boy is?

266
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
His name was Charlie Russell.

267
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm his mother.

268
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,600
He's only 10 years old.

269
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,500
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

270
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,800
You'd better go check on the mother.

271
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,900
What do you have?

272
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,000
That 30-06 shell casing.

273
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,000
He was up here all right.

274
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,000
Welcome to Homicide.

275
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,500
The man who designed blue serge uniforms
for police departments...

276
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,900
...has to sell these for a living!

277
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,500
.458 Magnum?

278
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,300
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

279
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,100
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

280
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,300
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

281
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,100
What have you got, Lieutenant?

282
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,600
The blue flags represent the units that
are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

283
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

284
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,900
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

285
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,100
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

286
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,700
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

287
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,600
We're saving that for him.

288
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

289
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,500
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

290
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,600
Something bothering you?

291
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,500
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

292
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,700
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

293
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

294
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,600
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

295
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,500
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

296
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,500
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

297
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,100
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

298
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
Scorpio strikes again.

299
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
They like that feeling.

300
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,800
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

301
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,900
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

302
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
And they're having a novena tonight.

303
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,000
Go on.

304
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

305
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,200
The Russell boy was black.

306
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,000
He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.

307
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Inspector 71.

308
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,100
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

309
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,200
How about the priest?

310
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,600
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

311
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,700
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

312
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,300
Who?

313
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,100
Never guess.

314
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

315
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,400
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

316
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,300
Son of a bitch took the bait!

317
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,500
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

318
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,600
Now!

319
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,700
- You all right?
- I think so.

320
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,700
Call an ambulance.

321
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
Collins never knew what hit him.

322
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,200
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

323
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

324
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

325
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,300
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

326
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,000
Ann Mary Deacon.

327
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,700
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

328
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,400
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

329
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,300
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive. "

330
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,900
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

331
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

332
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,600
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

333
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
One man with yellow bag.

334
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,500
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

335
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,100
9 p.m.

336
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,500
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. tomorrow.

337
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,200
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

338
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,100
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

339
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,800
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio. "

340
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,200
Anything else?

341
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,100
The mother identified the bra...

342
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,900
...the hank of hair...

343
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,400
...and that.

344
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,200
The dentist identified that.

345
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,500
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

346
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
You know she's dead.

347
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,000
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

348
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,500
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

349
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,900
He's using up a lot of favors.

350
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,500
He wants to pay.

351
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
No tricks.

352
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,300
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

353
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,300
You got it.

354
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,500
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

355
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,300
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

356
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,200
No cover?
Not even one man?

357
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,800
Sure that's how to do it?

358
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

359
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,600
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

360
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,900
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

361
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,700
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

362
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,700
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

363
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,700
Testing 1, 2, 3...

364
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,200
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

365
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,300
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow. "

366
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
Okay, that's better.

367
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,100
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

368
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,600
...forget it.

369
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

370
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,300
Bring it back in one piece.

371
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,900
$200,000.

372
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,100
Count it and sign for it.

373
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,500
Did you count it out?

374
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,600
Did you count it, chief?

375
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,500
It's not my responsibility.

376
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,900
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

377
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,700
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

378
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,500
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

379
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,000
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

380
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

381
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,100
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

382
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,500
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

383
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,100
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

384
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,000
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

385
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,500
- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.

386
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,900
- What's your name?
- Callahan.

387
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,700
- What are you?
- Police officer.

388
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,500
Hello?

389
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,700
All right, police officer...

390
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,700
...this is how we play.

391
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,900
I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.

392
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,400
If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.

393
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,600
If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

394
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,300
...the girl dies.

395
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,500
- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.

396
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,000
No car.

397
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,000
I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.

398
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,700
I ring 4 times.
You don 't answer by the fourth ring...

399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,900
...that's the end of the game.

400
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,800
The girl dies.

401
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,900
What time you got?

402
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,000
- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.

403
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,200
I'm watching you.

404
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,300
Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.

405
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,500
Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?

406
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,900
- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.

407
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,100
Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.

408
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,900
Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

409
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,400
You sound like you had a good rest.

410
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,300
You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.

411
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,700
You better make it,
because if you don 't, dead girl!

412
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,100
Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

413
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

414
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,300
What's in the bag, man?

415
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,500
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

416
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,100
Just give us the wallet.

417
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,400
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

418
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,000
Don't answer that!

419
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,000
- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.

420
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,300
Chico, he hung up.

421
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,900
- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.

422
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,300
Go to the cross.

423
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,100
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

424
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm going up.

425
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,700
I see a couple of people.

426
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,700
Just a couple of kids necking.

427
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,300
Boys or girls?

428
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,200
I'm Callahan.

429
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,100
My friends call me Alice.

430
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,100
And I will take a dare.

431
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,100
When was the last time
you were busted?

432
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,500
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

433
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,300
Well, do it at home.

434
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Freeze!

435
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,100
Just like a statue.

436
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,500
That's right.

437
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,000
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

438
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,800
I'll kill you and the girl both.

439
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,800
Understand?

440
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,400
Yeah.

441
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,100
Drop the bag.

442
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,900
Left hand.

443
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,000
Let's see the gun.

444
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,500
My!

445
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,500
That's a big one.

446
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,800
Left hand. Throw it.

447
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,300
Easy.

448
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,700
Raise your hands.

449
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,700
Come on, get them up.

450
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,500
Now turn.

451
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,500
Face the cross.

452
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Come on.

453
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,900
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

454
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You lift that hand once more and
I won't let you know where the girl is!

455
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,100
Do we understand each other?

456
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,300
Do we understand each other?

457
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

458
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,400
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

459
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

460
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,200
Do we understand each other?

461
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,400
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

462
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,800
Listen to me carefully.

463
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,500
I've changed my mind.

464
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,600
I'm going to let her die.

465
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,700
I just wanted you to know that.

466
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:06,300
You understand? I ijust wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.

467
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,700
Goodbye, Callahan!

468
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,500
Chico, don't kill him!

469
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,100
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, Chief.

470
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,500
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

471
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,300
He's right here.

472
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,100
He's got two cracked ribs.

473
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,000
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

474
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,300
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

475
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,700
I'm sending him home.

476
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,300
Right, Chief.

477
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,000
He says beat it! That's an order.

478
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,500
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

479
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,200
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

480
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

481
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,300
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

482
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,200
What am I going to tell him?

483
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,900
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

484
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

485
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,300
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

486
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,900
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

487
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,400
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

488
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

489
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,900
- Put him on.
- What is it?

490
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,600
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

491
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,100
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

492
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,400
Long blond hair...

493
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,500
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

494
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,300
Pale complexion.

495
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,900
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

496
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,700
They usually give a phony name.

497
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,000
But I've seen him someplace.

498
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,500
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

499
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,600
I'm trying to think!

500
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,200
It was... .

501
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,600
I believe he works around here.

502
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,700
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

503
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,600
Yes, just a moment.

504
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,100
She'll be dead in an hour!

505
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,300
I'm trying to remember!

506
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,400
I've got who he is.

507
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,300
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

508
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,500
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

509
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,300
- Live where?
- There.

510
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,600
Kezar Stadium.

511
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Illegal entry. No warrant.

512
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,500
Looks like we climb.

513
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,300
Too much linguine.

514
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,000
I'll find another way.

515
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,100
Stop!

516
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,300
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

517
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,700
You need any help?

518
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:32,100
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

519
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,900
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

520
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,500
Let me have a doctor!

521
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,100
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

522
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,200
The girl, where is she?

523
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,500
You tried to kill me!

524
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,800
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

525
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,100
I want a lawyer.

526
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,200
I said, where's the girl?

527
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,500
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

528
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,900
I have the right to a lawyer!

529
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,200
Don't! Please!

530
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,900
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

531
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,600
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

532
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,700
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

533
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,100
- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.

534
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,200
Won't you come this way?

535
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,900
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

536
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,900
I'll be done in a minute.

537
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,900
Have a seat.

538
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,500
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

539
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,300
A very unusual piece of police work.

540
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,200
Really amazing.

541
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,600
I had some luck.

542
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,500
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

543
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,900
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

544
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,000
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

545
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,300
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

546
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,800
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

547
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,900
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

548
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,000
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

549
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,500
You should be.
I've got news for you.

550
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,300
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

551
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,000
What are you talking about?

552
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,300
He's free!

553
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,500
You're letting him go?

554
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,400
We have to.
We can't try him.

555
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,900
And why is that?

556
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,000
Because I'm not wasting
1 /2 million tax dollars...

557
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,400
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

558
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,300
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

559
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,300
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

560
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,900
Zero.

561
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:28,900
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

562
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,000
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

563
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,100
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

564
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,700
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

565
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,000
It's the law.

566
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,100
Then the law is crazy!

567
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,000
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

568
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,900
He also holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

569
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,100
Your Honor?

570
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,000
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

571
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,300
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

572
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,300
...is inadmissible in court.

573
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,300
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

574
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,700
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

575
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,900
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

576
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,200
But I didn't know that!

577
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:21,400
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

578
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,700
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

579
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,800
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

580
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,300
...physical evidence...

581
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,700
...would have to be excluded.

582
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,300
There must be something
you can get him on!

583
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,400
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

584
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,800
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

585
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,800
Now, the suspect's rights...

586
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,700
...were violated...

587
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,100
...under the 4th and 5th...

588
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,000
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

589
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,700
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

590
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,900
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

591
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,600
The district attorney's office!

592
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,200
If you'll let us.

593
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,700
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

594
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,700
He won't be out there long.

595
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
What is that supposed to mean?

596
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,300
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

597
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,100
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

598
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,900
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

599
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,700
How do you know?

600
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,600
Because he likes it.

601
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,800
You sure you weren't tailed?

602
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,500
Yeah.

603
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,300
You really want $200 worth.

604
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,200
Every penny of it.

605
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,300
Might as well be comfortable.

606
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,600
Go on, sit.

607
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,400
Relax.

608
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,500
Take it easy.

609
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,100
It's going to be all right.

610
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,900
You sure you want the rest of it?

611
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,300
Every penny's worth!

612
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,100
You black son of a bitch!

613
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,200
This one's on the house.

614
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,700
That's got to be him.

615
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,200
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

616
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,300
I swear it. As God is my judge.

617
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,500
Why are they harassing you?

618
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,700
They tried to frame me with the murder.

619
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,700
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

620
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,900
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty and look at what they did to me.

621
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:51,300
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

622
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,700
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

623
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,800
Did you see who did this to you?

624
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,200
Can you identify him?

625
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,900
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.

626
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

627
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,300
Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.

628
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,900
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

629
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,600
What about it, Harry?

630
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,900
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

631
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,800
Have you been following him?

632
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,700
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

633
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,300
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

634
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,600
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

635
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,900
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

636
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,700
I don't want any more surveillance!

637
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,300
Neither does he.

638
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,300
What does that mean?

639
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,500
Good night, sir.

640
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,900
Go ahead. Try them.

641
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,900
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

642
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,700
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

643
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,200
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

644
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,800
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

645
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,900
Doing a lot of thinking about it and... .

646
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,900
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

647
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,500
...what for? You know?

648
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,600
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

649
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,400
See you tomorrow. Same time?

650
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,000
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

651
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,900
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

652
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,500
No class.

653
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,400
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

654
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

655
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,500
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

656
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,700
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

657
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,400
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

658
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,900
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

659
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,700
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

660
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,100
And I think...

661
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,600
...what if it's the last time I see him?

662
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,200
Am I the only one?

663
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,400
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

664
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,700
No.

665
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,900
You mean she got used to it?

666
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,100
No, she never did, really.

667
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,600
What, then?

668
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,700
She's dead.

669
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,100
Please, forgive me.

670
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,900
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

671
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,500
No reason for it, really.

672
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,500
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

673
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,800
I want you to tell Chico...

674
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,800
...that I understand him quitting.

675
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,100
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

676
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,700
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

677
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,600
I really don't.

678
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,500
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

679
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,800
What the hell happened to you?

680
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,900
My wife's brother.

681
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,200
I hit her...

682
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,100
...so he hit me.

683
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,700
Several times.

684
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,600
$5.69.

685
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,500
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

686
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,100
14 times the last 3 years.

687
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,200
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

688
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,900
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

689
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,700
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

690
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,300
Please, I scare easy.

691
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,000
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

692
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,100
Goodbye.

693
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,100
See you tomorrow.

694
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,200
Everybody out who gets out here?

695
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,100
School bus inspector.

696
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,800
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

697
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,500
I'm authorizing it, so go.

698
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,500
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

699
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,900
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

700
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:38,400
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

701
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,400
Let's have some fun now.

702
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,200
Who knows a song?

703
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,400
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

704
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,600
Come on, sing for us.

705
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,700
Old MacDonald had a farm.

706
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,800
E-l-E-l-O

707
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,600
And on his farm, he had some ducks...

708
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,400
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

709
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,000
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

710
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,200
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

711
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,900
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

712
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,300
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

713
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,700
Tell them the man is dangerous.

714
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,600
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

715
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,300
"To the City of San Francisco.

716
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,900
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

717
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,700
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

718
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,000
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

719
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,700
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

720
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,200
...exactly what I say. Scorpio. "

721
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,100
Better have somebody standing by!

722
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,100
I don't think it's a false alarm.

723
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,500
There's a call for you on line 2.

724
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,100
I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.

725
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,200
- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.

726
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:42,700
I got the bus and... .

727
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,300
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

728
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,300
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

729
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,100
Just tell him.

730
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,900
Not my fault, he had a gun...

731
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,000
Just your name!

732
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,300
This is Marcella Platt.

733
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,500
You can check if you want.
But I don 't see any point.

734
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,200
I'm not bullshitting.

735
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,400
It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...

736
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,100
...the kids start dying.

737
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,800
- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.

738
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,700
The money will be there
by the time you get there.

739
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,900
Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.

740
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,100
Just me and a busload of kids.

741
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,500
I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
Blvd., on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.

742
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,500
I don 't want any police cars...

743
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:27,800
...helicopters, whatever.

744
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,100
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

745
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,000
Where are you going?

746
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,600
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

747
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,500
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

748
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,300
I give you my word of honor.

749
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,400
Marcella Platt. It checks.

750
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,600
Willing to take the money to him?

751
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:57,900
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

752
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,100
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

753
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,500
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

754
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,300
And that's a direct order!

755
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,500
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

756
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Row, row, row your boat

757
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,300
Gently down the stream

758
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,600
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

759
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,200
Where are we going?

760
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,700
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

761
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:49,700
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

762
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,500
I want to go home to my mother.

763
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,800
Go home to your what?

764
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,300
Now, sing! Sing again!

765
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,100
Row, row, row your boat

766
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,100
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

767
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,800
Are you sick?
What is it?

768
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,100
Sing or your mothers will die!

769
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,900
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

770
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,800
Get in the right-hand lane.

771
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,300
Not right to treat children that way.

772
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,900
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

773
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,200
And get in the right-hand lane!

774
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,800
I want my mother.

775
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,400
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

776
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,700
Make a right there.

777
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,600
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

778
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,000
Not this one.

779
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,900
I want my mother.

780
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,200
Shut up!

781
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,700
Just get to the right!

782
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,500
Jesus!

783
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,700
What the hell is he doing up there?

784
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,100
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

785
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,000
Drop the gun, creep!

786
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,700
I'll blow his brains out.

787
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,700
Drop the fucking gun!

788
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,800
I know what you're thinking.

789
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,400
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

790
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,500
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself,
in all this excitement.

791
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,100
But being this is a.44 Magnum,
the most powerful handgun in the world...

792
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,900
...and will blow your head clean off...

793
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,000
...you've got to ask yourself...

794
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,900
..."Do I feel lucky?"

795
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,700
Well, do you, punk?

796
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:22,700
