1
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,260
上帝!
Jesus!

2
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,400
"致旧金山市府.
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,210
"我十分乐意每天干掉一个人...
"I will enjoy killing one person every day...

4
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,340
"...直到给我10万美金.
"...until you pay me one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,540
"如果没问题,请在明天早上...
"If you agree, say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,830
"...旧金山时报登个私人启示...
"...at personal column, San Francisco Chronicle...

7
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,170
"...到时我回合你们联络.
"...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,070
"如果我没有收到你们的回话...
"If I do not hear from you...

9
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,850
"...我将十分乐意再干掉一个天主教的牧师或者一个（黑鬼）...
"...it'll be my next pleasure to kill a Catholic priest or a...

10
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,910
"...蝎子."
"...Scorpio."

11
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,440
他们究竟在想些什么?
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,450
疯子.
Kooks.

13
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,410
他到底想让我到哪去筹集10万美元呢?
Where the hell does he expect me to find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,930
市长先生,你不会想付钱给他吧？
You're not thinking of paying him, are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,550
旧金山市府不会同罪犯妥协的.
The City of San Francisco does not pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,480
相反,我们会把钱花在警察局.
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,350
局长,谁负责这个案子？
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,260
科拉汉探员,他正在外面等候.
Inspector Callahan. He's outside.

19
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,050
叫科拉汉探员进来.
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,020
科拉汉？
Callahan?

21
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,840
市长先生,他就是科拉汉探员..
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,960
好的.
All right.

23
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,350
让我们谈谈吧.
Let's have it.

24
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,510
- 谈什么? - 你的报告.你调查到了什么？
- What? - Your report. What have you done?

25
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
在过去的45分钟...
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,180
...我一直在你的办公室外傻等.
...I've been sitting in your outer office waiting on you.

27
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,110
小心点,哈里. 要知道你在和市长先生说话.
Damn it, Harry. It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,630
我们能坐下来谈么,克拉汉探员.
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,480
已经有一个女士死了！
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,780
我已经问过你进展得怎么样了？ 难道还不够么？
I've asked you what's being done. Fair enough?

31
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,280
我们已经派一组人鉴定档案.
We've got a dozen men checking identification files.

32
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,910
调查每一个有案底的勒索者. 梁上君子...
Checking on all known extortionists, rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,380
...枪手,偷窥者...
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,900
市长先生?
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,530
我们已经在屋顶部署了人员 还安排了直升机...
We've arranged for rooftop surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,060
...尤其在天主教堂和学校附近...
...especially around the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,890
...还有黑人聚集区.
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,390
武器专家正在鉴定子弹.
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,690
我们已经确认型号是30-60.
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,490
七条膛线,右手螺旋....
Seven lands and grooves, right-hand twist...

41
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,910
我们正在用计算机搜集...
We're running a computer check...

42
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,680
...所有出生在...
...on everybody in the files whose birthday falls between...

43
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,210
..9月21日和10月23日之间的人的名单..
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,270
为什么？
Why?

45
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,620
因为这些人的星座是天蝎.
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,340
谢谢你,探员..
Thank you, Inspector.

47
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,660
你们向外界透露这些了吗？
Mention this note to anyone?

48
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,430
你呢？
How about you?

49
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,110
没有.
Nobody.

50
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,980
你的妻子,情人,还有媒体?
Your wife, sweetheart? Press?

51
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,280
没有.
Nobody.

52
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,890
好吧,让媒体放风.
All right. Give the message to the Chronicle.

53
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,510
就说我们会付钱 但是这么多钱需要时间.
We'll pay. But we need time to get the money together.

54
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,570
等一下.你的意思是？
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
你想耍花招？
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,760
这将给我们喘息的时间.
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,780
但这会害死其他人的.
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,830
让我会会这个杂种！
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,460
不,不会这样的 那才真会已一场惨剧收场.
Nope, none of that. It would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,550
我同意局长的意见. 我们就这样做.
I agree with the chief. We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,700
谢谢你的赏脸,市长阁下. 来吧,探员,我们走.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,960
我不希望你去年 在菲尔莫制造的灾难重现.
I don't want trouble, like you had last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
先生
sir？

64
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,810
哈里
harry

65
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,590
知道么？这是原则.
understand？That's my policy.

66
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,590
当一个男子追一位妙龄少女...
When an adult male is chasing a female...

67
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,930
并想强奸时,开枪是我的职责.
...with intent to commit rape, I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

68
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,870
准备？
Intent?

69
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,500
你怎么会那么认为？
How did you establish that?

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,030
当一个裸体男人在小巷里追一个女人, 上举刀下举棍,嘿嘿..
When a naked man chases a woman in an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

71
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,430
我认为这种人是 不会为红十字会筹款的.
...I figure he isn't out collecting for the Red Cross.

72
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
他说的对.
I think he's got a point.

73
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
-汉拉克探员 -杰非
- Inspector Callahan. - Jaffee.

74
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,470
谢谢
thanks

75
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,150
照旧.
Usual.

76
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,650
是照旧的午餐还是晚餐?
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

77
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,200
有什么不同么？
What difference does it make?

78
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,050
没什么.
Not much.

79
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,150
嗨,杰斐...
Hey, Jaffee...

80
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,520
那个褐色福特轿车 还停在银行前面的吗？
...is that tan Ford still in front of the bank?

81
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,110
褐色福特轿车？
Tan Ford?

82
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,480
是的,褐色福特.
Yeah, tan Ford.

83
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,060
没熄火？
Engine running?

84
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,120
我不知道,我怎么知道？
I don't know. How can I tell?

85
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,700
- 看看排气管冒黑烟么？ - 嗯,真恶心.
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe. - That's awful!

86
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,950
看那些烟？
Look at that pollution.

87
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,750
哦？

88
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,970
你能帮个忙么？
Do me a favor, will you?

89
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,680
打这个电话
Call this telephone number.

90
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,100
警察局？
Police Department?

91
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,200
告诉他们克拉汉探员认为...
Tell them Inspector Callahan thinks there's a...

92
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,360
有人正在银行抢劫,明白听清了么？
...two-eleven in progress at the bank. Got it?

93
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,420
听清了么.
Got it.

94
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,110
一定要告诉他们正在抢,懂么？
Be sure and tell them it's in progress, right?

95
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,270
正在抢.
In progress.

96
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,530
是的,先生.
Yes, sir.

97
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,310
现在,他们就等着警察来吧.
Now, if they'll just wait till the cavalry arrives.

98
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,980
妈的!
Shit!

99
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,810
站住!
Halt!

100
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,260
我知道你在想什么.
I know what you're thinking.

101
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,060
"这个人是开了六枪还是五枪？"
Did he fire six shots or only five?

102
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,590
说实话,由于兴奋我忘了数.
To tell the truth, in all the excitement I've kind of lost track myself.

103
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,720
但我拿着这把44毫米口径的转轮手枪 世界上威力最大的手枪，
But since this is a.44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun...

104
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,010
...可以完全打爆你的头情况下...
...and would blow your head clean off...

105
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,730
...你该问问自己 "我今天走运么？"
...you've got to ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

106
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,540
哦.你觉得呢？渣滓?
Well, do you, punk?

107
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,440
我想知道.
I got to know.

108
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,360
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!

109
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,090
不错,哈里,看来这条腿还有救.
It looks like we can save that leg.

110
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,960
为了生活没办法.
I've got a couple under my knee.

111
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,760
考虑换个别的工作？
Ever consider another line of work?

112
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,030
我十分感谢你的建议斯蒂芬.
I really appreciate this, Steve.

113
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,640
当然.我们乡下小子总该同舟共济的.
We Potrero Hill boys have to stick together.

114
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,640
面对现实吧.
Nothing fancy, now.

115
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,390
用镊子涂一点药水就够了.
Just a little tweezers and Mercurochrome.

116
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,450
我有去到到警察局 教你如何逼供犯人吗？
Do I tell you how to beat a confession out of a prisoner?

117
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,210
- 我过界了. - 你或许会有些不舒服.
- I haven't got all night. - You might experience discomfort.

118
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,870
如果那样,就让你妻子帮...
But if you do, just have your wife fix a...

119
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,140
对不起,哈里.
Sorry, Harry.

120
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,110
你用那个做什么？
What will you do with those?

121
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,660
把你的裤子剪开.
Cut your pants off.

122
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,500
-不,我们还是把它脱了吧. - 那会弄伤你的.
- No. We'll pull them off. - It'll hurt.

123
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,030
为了节约 $29.50, 就痛点吧.
For $29.50, let it hurt.

124
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,620
你可以转过身,如果觉难堪的话.
You can turn your back if you're embarrassed.

125
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,500
- 早上好,探长.. - 你好,麦瑞.
- Good morning, Inspector. - Maria.

126
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,100
当然！
yeah！

127
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,250
你要见我么,长官？
You wanted to see me, Lieutenant?

128
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,870
你究竟打算什么时候去剪发？
When the hell you going to get a haircut?

129
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,920
你去剪的时候.
Whenever you do.

130
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,180
谁有空？ 我一直在寻找线索到凌晨三点.
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m. Checking the search patterns.

131
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,750
- 都花在加班上了. - 要干一天的..
- Put in for overtime. - That'll be the day.

132
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,360
你做的不错. 局长很满意.
You made a good pinch. Chief was pleased.

133
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,520
- 他很满意？ - 是的,他说你做的很棒.
- He was? - He wanted me to tell you: "Well done!"

134
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,960
我真是感动得一塌糊涂.
I can't tell you how moved I am.

135
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,530
顺便说一下
I pass along a compliment...

136
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,680
你可以有礼貌一点 说句谢谢又不会死.
...you could be a little polite. It might not kill you to say thanks.

137

探长.我想问个问题.

171

为什么大家都叫你硬汉哈里.
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

172

凡是你能想到的,他都不喜欢.
You name it.

176
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,030
- 那么,墨西哥人呢? - 自己问他!
- How does he feel about Mexicans? - Ask him!

177
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830

I don't know how the helicopter boys lost him!

185

他们怎么眼睁睁看着他跑了?
How could they let him get out without seeing him?

186
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,000
他们只说没做，正如所料.
They were probably talking instead of looking, like they were supposed to.

187
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,590
有可能.
That's possible.

It was a terrible mess. I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

266
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,920
- 我上来只是想知道你的名字和住址. - 为什么?
- I'd just like your name and address. - Why?

267
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,660
等你下去后,会变得支离破碎!
It's such a mess down there afterwards!

268
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,990
根本无法确认你的身份. 即使找到你的驾照!
It makes identification impossible. Even if they find your driver's license!

269
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,940
也会被血泡碎!
All that blood!

270
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,510
我想,我想我要吐了.
I think.I think I'm going to puke!

271
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,800
不要吐,宝贝. 底下那些人都在看着.
Don't do that, son. All those people down there looking up.

272
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,760
消防队长也在仰头看...
The fire chief looking up. With his face...

273
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,780
你这个杂种!
You rotten bastard!

274
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,440
把担架抬走.
Get the stretcher out here.

275
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,490
现在你明白我为什么叫硬汉哈里了？ 每一件脏活都是这么解决的.
Now you know why I'm called Dirty Harry. Every dirty job that comes along.

276
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,960
71号探员.71号探员.
Inspector 71.Inspector 71.

277
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,090
我是71号探员
This is Inspector 71.

278
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,140
刚得到消息,在希尔和特斯街角 一个黑人男孩出事了.
Got something for you. Corner of Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.

279
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,520
他怎么了？
What about him?

280
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,480
他被子弹打中面部,轰的四分五裂.
Shot in the face. Blew part of it away.

281
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,420
确认死者身份了么?
Anybody know who the boy is?

282
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,950
他叫查理拉塞尔.
His name was Charlie Russell.

283
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,480
我是他妈妈.
I'm his mother.

284
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,310
他才十岁.
He's only 10 years old.

285
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,900
探长,这位长官... 哦,天呀!
Inspector, this officer... Oh, Jesus Christ!

286
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,100
你还是去安慰那位妈妈吧.
You'd better go check on the mother.

287
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,020
你发现什么了么?
What do you have?

288
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,330
发现了30-05型的弹壳.
That 30-06 shell casing.

289
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,340
他应该就在这开的枪.
He was up here all right.

290
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,590
那个坏蛋又犯案了.
Welcome to Homicide.

291
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,420
为警察局设计这套蓝色制服的家伙...
The man who designed blue serge uniforms for police departments...

292
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,960
...现在不得不靠买这种刷子谋生了!
...has to sell these for a living!

293
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,050
448毫米的,大弹匣步枪?
.458 Magnum?

294
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,290
- 这能打死头大象了. - 是的.
- This thing will stop an elephant. - Yeah.

295
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,030
- 显然你只喜欢小型的. - 先生,我只有那些.
- Apparently you like a little edge. - All I can get, sir.

296
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,750
他不是大象,哈里. 他不是任何动物.
He's no elephant, Harry. He's no animal of any kind.

297
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,410
你们发现什么了, 先生?
What have you got, Lieutenant?

298
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,810
蓝色标识的地方今晚将有人巡逻.
The blue flags represent the units that are going to be on duty by dark tonight.

299
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,140
- 两班倒,还开加班. - 尤其是晚上.
- Double shifts and overtime. - At nighttime.

300
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,010
白天有直升机,令他无法活动.
Daylight, the helicopters will keep him off the roofs.

301
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,120
我们尽量高调. 所有警员尽量引人注目。
We're going for high visibility. Units will make themselves very noticeable.

302
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,680
- 除了这块地区. - 对.北滩地区.
- Except here. - Right. The North Beach area.

303
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,380
把那里留他.
We're saving that for him.

304
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,930
- 你知道在哪监视比较好? - 知道.
- Have you found a good stakeout? - I think so.

305
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,960
就是昨天他们发现他的那个地方.
It's a building that overlooks the roof where they spotted him yesterday.

306
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,150
有什么问题么?
Something bothering you?

307
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,850
没有.
Nothing.

308
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:49,080
说吧. 这没外人.
Speak up. You're among friends here.

309
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,410
他再回到那个屋顶是不太可能的.
It seems a long shot that he'd come back to the same roof.

310
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,540
在旧金山有那么多高楼
There are a lot of rooftops in San Francisco.

311
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,650
但是多数上屋顶的门已经被锁住了. 只有这个是给他留着的.
Most of them are locked. This particular one'll be open for him.

312
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,830
这些变态的家伙的行为是有规律的.
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

313
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,880
我们不是见过有些人总是去抢 同一条街上的商店3,4次.
We know they'll rob the very same store 3, 4 times in a row.

314
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,210
或许是在寻找某种变态的满足吧.
Must appeal to their superego or something.

315
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,760
蝎子又行动了.
Scorpio strikes again.

316
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,850
他们喜欢那种感觉.
They like that feeling.

317
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,750
还有一个理由令他选择同一个屋顶.
There's one other reason why he might pick the same rooftop.

318
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,940
能清楚地监视到圣保罗教堂.
He's got a clear view of the St. Peter and Paul's church.

319
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,060
而今晚教堂将举行弥撒.
And they're having a novena tonight.

320
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,570
还有呢.
Go on.

321
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,810
在纸条上他说要杀一个黑鬼和一个神父.
The note. He threatened to kill a priest or a Negro.

322
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,550
那个男孩是个黑小子.
The Russell boy was black.

323
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,350
他将要兑现另一个目标--神父.
He may just figure he owes himself a padre.

324
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,900
这是71号探员.
Inspector 71.

325
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,440
我们已经到达了监视地点.
We're in position to start our surveillance.

326
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,840
神父怎么办?
How about the priest?

327
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,210
- 他知道自己是诱饵么? - 是的,他愿意做.
- He knows he's being set up for bait? - Yeah, he wanted to.

328
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,530
我们告诉他今晚将有人顶替他.
We told him we had a volunteer willing to take his place.

329
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,690
谁?
Who?

330
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,160
你猜不到的.
Never guess.

331
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,300
嗯.我知道了 要静候凶手.
Yeah, I know. Welcome to Homicide.

332
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,600
你有点亏待自己,哈里.
You owe it to yourself to live a little, Harry.

333
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,490
狗娘养的,他上勾了!
Son-of-a-bitch took the bait!

334
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,990
等我说 "照," 就用手电筒照他.
When I say "now," hit him with the light.

335
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,170
照!
Now!

336
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,070
- 你还好么? - 我想没事.
- You all right? - I think so.

337
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,440
叫救护车来.
Call an ambulance.

338
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,020
克林永远不会搞清楚是谁开的枪.
Collins never knew what hit him.

339
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,550
我们走. .清理现场 没什么好看的.
Let's go. Clear the alley. There's nothing to see.

340
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,080
呼叫总部. 他在北滩逃脱..
Call headquarters. He's loose in North Beach.

341
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,230
又是一场新的较量,伙计.
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

342
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,950
他绑架了一个14岁的女孩儿.
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

343
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,810
安-玛丽-迪肯.
Ann-Mary Deacon.

344
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,330
防爆小组接到电话,在金门公园发现了 一个可疑物体.
The bomb squad got a call. Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

345
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,900
是给市长的. 实验室把它转到这里来 里面有一封信.
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab sent it to us, with this letter inside.

346
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,790
"安-玛丽-迪肯, 将被活埋了."
"Ann-Mary Deacon, buried alive."

347
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,620
可怜的孩子昨晚去看电影后就没回家.
The poor kid went to the movies last night and never came home.

348
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,210
旧金山警局耍了我两次。 这是你们逼的.
"Double-crossing San Francisco police made me do this.

349
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,940
"我要10元和20元面值的赎金20万.
"New ransom $200,000, in used tens and twenties.

350
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,370
"派一个人用黄皮包送到.
"One man with yellow bag.

351
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,030
"格林伊斯特港的南面的码头.
"South side Marina. Green East Harbor.

352
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,050
"晚上九点.
"9 p.m.

353
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,280
"否则,她只会活到明早三点.
"She has oxygen till 3 a.m. Tomorrow.

354
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,360
"红色的乳罩和内裤,可爱的乳头
"Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

355
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,190
"左腿上的痣.任何差错都有可能让我杀了她...
"Mole on left thigh. Anything cute and you'll force me to let girl die...

356
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,920
"...让她窒息而死. 署名, 蝎子."
"...of slow suffocation. Signed, Scorpio."

357
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,950
还有么?
Anything else?

358
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,850
女孩的妈妈已经确认头发和乳罩都是那孩子的.
The mother identified the bra, the hank of hair.

359
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,070
还有.
And that.

360
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,370
牙医也认定过了.
The dentist identified that.

361
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,520
说是用钳子拽下来的.
Said it was pulled out with a pair of pliers.

362
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,860
你应该知道孩子已经死了.
You know she's dead.

363
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,260
我只知道如果不付钱,孩子明早三点才会死.
All I know is the letter says she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

364
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,920
市长现在正在四处筹钱.
The mayor's out trying to put the money together now.

365
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,730
他已经精疲力竭了.
He's using up a lot of favors.

366
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,190
他要付赎金.
He wants to pay.

367
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,290
不耍花样.
No tricks.

368
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,650
我需要一个送钱的. 你去么?
We need a bag man. You want the job?

369
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,470
就你了.
You got it.

370
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,560
- 晚上6点到局长办公室. - 好的.
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m. - All right.

371
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,840
- 等等,我呢? - 你没任务了.
- Wait a minute. What about me? - You're out.

372
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,320
不要掩护? 就一个人去?
No cover? Not even one man?

373
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:49,719
确定那么做?
Sure that's how to do it?

374
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,960
不,我不确定! 但那都是我的命令,懂么?
I'm not sure! But those are my orders. All right?

375
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,220
不要忘了他叫硬汉哈里. 他会把事情搞砸得.
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry. He gets the shit end of the stick.

376
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,050
再多说一句,我会把你踢死.
One more word and you're chopped off at the ankles.

377
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,050
我们都让一步 让他今晚出任务吧.
Al, let's split the difference. Give him the night off.

378
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,320
都他妈的离开这, 你们两个.
Get the hell out of here, both of you.

379
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,050
喂,1, 2, 3...
Testing 1, 2, 3...

380
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,180
- 你那么大声干什么? - 你只要小声说些话就行了.
- What are you yelling for? - All you have to do is whisper.

381
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,910
"玛丽有只小羊羔, 它的毛就像雪一样白."
"Mary had a little lamb, its fleece as white as snow."

382
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,510
不错,效果很好.
Okay, that's better.

383
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,470
两三个障碍物还可以. 但是在隧道里...
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks. But in a tunnel...

384
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,930
...就不行了.
...forget it.

385
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,090
好的, 西德. 我欠你个人情.
All right, Sid. What do I owe you?

386
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,210
把它完整的还回来.
Bring it back in one piece.

387
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:47,360
20万英镑.
$200,000.

388
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,350
数一下,然后签个字.
Count it and sign for it.

389
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,730
你数过了么？
Did you count it out?

390
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,030
局长,你呢?
Did you count it, chief?

391
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,580
那不是我的活.
It's not my responsibility.

392
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:07,669
早就知道我能在警察队伍中发财.
Always knew I'd get rich on the police force.

393
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,639
记住不能让其他人把包拿走.
Just make sure nobody takes it away from you.

394
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,020
上帝知道他怎么和你联络. 他有可能耍你在整个城跑.
God knows how he'll contact you. He'll probably run you all over town.

395
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,750
你要完全按照他的吩咐做.
Go where you're told. Do what you're told.

396
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,460
按照他的规矩做,懂么?
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

397
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,530
不要自作主张. 不要轻举妄动王东.
Nothing cute. Nothing fancy.

398
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:41,949
只管把钱付了,然后回来报告.
Just pay the ransom money and report back here.

399
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,020
你是否介意我拿点透明胶？
Would you mind if I borrowed a little Scotch tape?

400
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,120
警官要懂得如何用那种武器 真令人厌恶.
It's disgusting that a police officer should know how to use that weapon.

401
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,770
-你拿到了一个黄色手提箱？ -是的,就在我手上
- You got a yellow suitcase? - Yeah, I got it right with me.

404
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,101
喂？
Hello?

405
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,760
喂？
Hello?

406
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:34,910
好吧,警官...
All right, police officer...

407
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,740
...我来讲游戏规则.
...this is how we play.

408
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,850
为了确定你是单独一个人, 我会让你在镇子上兜几圈
I bounce you all over town to make sure you're alone.

409
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,950
如果让我认为你被跟踪着 那女孩救死
If I even think you're being followed, the girl dies.

410
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,300
如果你和任何人说话, 就算是一条在路灯下撒尿的狗...
If you talk to anyone, even if it's a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...

411
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,180
...那女孩就死
...the girl dies.

412
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,770
- 那女孩现在怎样？ - 闭上嘴听我说！
- Is the girl okay? - Just shut up and listen.

413
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,130
不许开车
No car.

414
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,490
我给你时间在电话亭之间转移
I give you some time to go from phone booth to phone booth.

415
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,270
我打四次电话 如果你在铃响第四次时仍未接听...
I ring 4 times. You don't answer by the fourth ring...

416
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,300
...游戏结束.
...that's the end of the game.

417
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,580
女孩没命
The girl dies.

418
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,529
你的表几点钟
What time you got?

419
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,560
- 9:30. 现在听着... - 你听着.
- 9:30. Now listen... - You listen.

420
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,650
我在监视你.
I'm watching you.

421
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,990
不是一直 但你不会知道是什么时候或是在哪儿.
Not all the time, but you'll never know when or where.

422
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:26,860
现在马上去福瑞斯特希尔车站 明白了吗？
Now get to Forest Hills Station as fast as you can. Understand?

423
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,550
- 是的. - 希望你不太蠢.
- Yeah. - I hope you're not stupid.

424
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,620
-科拉汉. -科拉汉.

425
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,570
下楼. 上k号车.
Downstairs. Take the "K" car.

426
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,330
在教堂20号下车,快一点 否则你就输了
Get off at Church and 20th. Hurry up, or you'll blow it.

427
00:52:28,339 --> 00:52:30,359
听起来你休息得很好
You sound like you had a good rest.

428
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,090
你确实需要它 这一次会让你享受一些小跑动.
You'll need it. I'm going to give you a nice little run this time.

429
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,590
你最好能做到,因为如果你做不到 那女孩就死定了
You better make it, because if you don't, dead girl!

430
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,400
水生物公园汉堡包店的公共电话.
Public phone, hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.

431
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,820
呵呵呵,猪杂种
Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.

432
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:22,729
包里是什么？伙计.
What's in the bag, man?

433
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,740
- 你们这些家伙迷路了吗？让开,听见没？ - 打开包！
- You dudes get lost now, you hear? - Screw the bag!

434
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,280
把钱包给我们.
Just give us the wallet.

435
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:33,479
你没听到吗,混蛋？
You don't listen, asshole!

436
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:03,049
别接电话
Don't answer that!

437
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:15,889
- 谁接的电话了？ - 一个老家伙,从没见过的
- Who picked it up? - Some old guy. Never saw him before.

438
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,070
奇科, 他挂了.
Chico, he hung up.

439
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,530
- 知道密特戴维森公园吗？ - 知道.

440
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,880
去十字架那里.
Go to the cross.

441
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,740
我在兰斯德尔街的入口.
I'm at the entrance on Lansdale Street.

442
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,770
我进去了.
I'm going up.

443
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,679
我看见两个人.
I see a couple of people.

444
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,130
是两个人在亲热而已.
Just a couple of kids necking.

445
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,800
男的还是女的？
Boys or girls?

446
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,080
我是科拉汉.
I'm Callahan.

447
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,750
我的朋友叫我艾里斯.
My friends call me Alice.

448
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,780
我会很猛的.
And I will take a dare.

449
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,150
你上次被修理是什么时候？
When was the last time you were busted?

450
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,780
如果你是坏人,我可以杀了我自己.
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

451
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:15,269
那么,在家里完成.
Well, do it at home.

452
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,130
别动!
Freeze!

453
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,780
就像一塑雕像.
Just like a statue.

454
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:24,949
就这样.
That's right.

455
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,870
只要有一点小动作,不管是什么动作.
One wrong move, anything, I don't care.

456
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,740
我就把你和那个女孩都杀了.
I'll kill you and the girl both.

457
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,760
明白了吧?
Understand?

458
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,580
是的.
Yeah.

459
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,440
把包扔在地上.
Drop the bag.

460
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,500
用左手.
Left hand.

461
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,280
把枪拿出来.
Let's see the gun.

462
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:53,449
哦!
My!

463
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,520
是把大家伙.
That's a big one.

464
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,850
用左手扔掉他.
Left hand. Throw it.

465
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,249
慢点.
Easy.

466
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:07,099
把你的手举起来.
Raise your hands.

467
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,160
来.把双手举起来.
Come on, get them up.

468
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,270
现在,转过去.
Now turn.

469
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:16,289
面向十字架.
Face the cross.

470
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,160
快.
Come on.

471
00:58:20,899 --> 00:58:23,729
把脸贴在墙上.
Put your nose right up against the cement.

472
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:48,820
你再把手举起来一次, 我就不会告诉你女孩在哪!
You lift that hand once more and I won't let you know where the girl is!

473
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,190
我们彼此都十分了解?
Do we understand each other?

474
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,970
我们彼此都十分了解?
Do we understand each other?

475
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,610
不要耍花样! 不要.
Don't pass out on me yet! No, no.

476
00:58:56,979 --> 00:58:58,639
不,不.不要.不要!
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

477
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,990
不要给我装死, 你这头蠢猪!
Don't pass out on me yet, you rotten oinker!

478
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,850
我们真的彼此了解?
Do we understand each other?

479
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,960
如果你真想救回那个女孩 你最好回答我,知道么?
If you care what happens to the girl, you'd better answer me! All right?

480
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,150
仔细听着.
Listen to me carefully.

481
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,710
我改变主意了.
I've changed my mind.

482
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,100
我要杀死她.
I'm going to let her die.

483
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,370
我就是要你知道这个.
I just wanted you to know that.

484
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,730
你懂么? 我想让你死前知道这个.
You understand? I just wanted to make sure you knew that before I killed you.

485
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:41,089
再见,科拉汉!
Goodbye, Callahan!

486
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,419
奇科, 不要杀了他!
Chico, don't kill him!

487
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,850
局长,大夫说冈萨雷斯没什么.
The hospital report on Gonzales looks okay, Chief.

488
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,290
是的. 没错,他是个坚强的小伙子.
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

489
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,800
他在这.
He's right here.

490
01:01:55,699 --> 01:01:57,329
他断了两个肋骨.
He's got two cracked ribs.

491
01:01:57,329 --> 01:02:00,189
他们还要在早上给他做更详细的检查.
They want to do some more tests on him in the morning.

492
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,510
那个杂种把他揍得不轻.
The son of a bitch really kicked him a couple of beauts.

493
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,810
我会送他回家的.
I'm sending him home.

494
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:06,750
是的,局长.
Right, Chief.

495
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:09,529
他说滚! 这是命令.
He says beat it! That's an order.

496
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,370
局长问我是否误会了他的指令.
The chief wants to know if I misunderstood his orders.

497
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:19,030
意思是, 我是真蠢呢 还是故意违背他?
Meaning, am I just plain stupid or did I deliberately disobey him?

498
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,520
他想知道冈萨雷斯怎么会在那.
He wants to know what Gonzales was doing there.

499
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:24,639
既然他想知道我们为什么隐瞒实情.
He wants to know why we screwed everything up.

500
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:26,409
我跟他说什么?
What am I going to tell him?

501
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:31,459
就告诉他真相.
Why don't you start by telling him the truth?

502
01:02:31,459 --> 01:02:34,759
说是冈萨雷斯的上级让他这么做， 就是我.
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders from a superior. Me.

503
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:37,619
告诉他你什么都不知道.
Tell him you didn't know anything about it.

504
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,450
当事情结束他如果想撤我的职 我没意见.
When this is over, if he wants my badge, he can have that too.

505
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,600
你带酒了么?
You wouldn't have a belt of booze around here, would you?

506
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,760
布莱斯勒副局长的办公室.
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

507
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,740
- 找到他! - 发生什么了?
- Put him on. - What is it?

508
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,430
是公园的急救中心, 他们刚诊治了一个受了腿伤的家伙.
It's Park Emergency. They just treated a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

509
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,900
是的,医生? 那个人长的什么样？
Yeah, doctor? What'd this guy look like?

510
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:13,449
长长的金发...
Long blond hair...

511
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:18,699
...中等身材, 大约150磅. 面色苍白.
...medium build, about 150 pounds. Pale complexion.

512
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,700
- 医生,他说名字了么? - 没.
- He didn't give you his name, doc? - Nope.

513
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,450
他们通常都给一个假名.
They usually give a phony name.

514
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,280
但我在什么地方看过他.
But I've seen him someplace.

515
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:33,540
你的线索很重要. 有一个女孩子就要窒息而死了.
It's important you remember. There's a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

516
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,600
我再想想!我再想想!
I'm trying to think!

517
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:37,259
在哪来着...
It was...

518
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,990
我肯定他就在附近工作.
I believe he works around here.

519
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,190
医生,能看看么?他很疼!
Doctor, could you give him something? He's in pain!

520
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,850
好的,等等.
Yes, just a moment.

521
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,250
孩子一个小时以后就要死了.!
She'll be dead in an hour!

522
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,270
我在努力想!
I'm trying to remember!

523
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,199
哦,我想起来了.
I've got who he is.

524
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,320
当举行球赛的时候 他在那卖日程表.
When they had football, he used to sell programs at the stadium.

525
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,939
我想是球场的守门人让他住那的.
I think the groundskeeper lets him live there.

526
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,730
- 在哪? - 那.
- Live where? - There.

527
01:04:13,379 --> 01:04:15,009
卡泽球场.
Kezar Stadium.

528
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,610
没有搜查证，要非法进入？
Illegal entry. No warrant.

529
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,110
我们爬进去.
Looks like we climb.

530
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,910
不太好爬.
Too much linguine.

531
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,920
我再去找条路进去.
I'll find another way.

532
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:49,199
别动!
Stop!

533
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,980
别再开枪了! 你要杀了我!
Don't do anything more! You tried to kill me!

534
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:13,710
你需要帮忙么?
You need any help?

535
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:20,549
- 不关你事, 胖子. - 求求你了,不要开枪了!
- Go on and get some air, fatso. - Please! No more!

536
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:24,429
你没看见我受伤了么? 你射中我了,不要再开枪了!
Can't you see I'm hurt? You shot me! Please, don't!

537
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,720
我需要医生!
Let me have a doctor!

538
01:09:27,619 --> 01:09:30,089
我要医生! 请不要杀我!
Please, get me the doctor! Don't kill me!

539
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,870
那孩子在哪?
The girl, where is she?

540
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,170
你想杀了我？
You tried to kill me!

541
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:37,370
如果我想,你的脑浆早就把这玷污了,孩子在哪?
If I did, your head would be splattered all over this field. Where's the girl?

542
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,530
我要我的律师.
I want a lawyer.

543
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,460
我问你,孩子在哪?
I said, where's the girl?

544
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,360
我有权要一个律师.
I have the right for one.

545
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,850
孩子在哪?
Where's the girl?

546
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,510
我有权找律师!
I have the right for a lawyer!

547
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,070
不,不要这样!
Don't! Please!

548
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:52,040
我有权利. 我要我的律师!
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

549
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:34,780
哈里-科拉汉. 有什么急事找我？
Harry Callahan. He said it was urgent.

550
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,770
是的检察官有话和你说.
Yes, the district attorney has been wanting to talk to you.

551
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:41,970
- 科拉汉探长到了. - 请他进来.
- It's Inspector Callahan. - Have him come in, please.

552
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,350
请这边走.
Won't you come this way?inspector.

553
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,120
- 你要咖啡么? - 不,谢谢.
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee? - No, thanks.

554
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,800
我马上就好.
I'll be done in a minute.

555
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,660
坐吧.
Have a seat.

556
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:09,200
我仔细看了你的逮捕报告.
I've just been looking over your arrest report.

557
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,140
将警察工作做的非常与众不同.
A very unusual piece of police work.

558
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,690
令人惊讶.
Really amazing.

559
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:20,540
我比较走运罢了.
I had some luck.

560
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,440
你应该感到幸运我没有控告你谋杀!
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for assault with intent to commit murder!

561
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:32,080
谁给你权力去私闯民宅和拷打犯人?
Where does it say you've got a right to kick down doors, torture suspects?

562
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,140
拒绝提供医疗服务和法律援助, 你都干了些什么?
Deny medical attention and legal counsel? Where have you been?

563
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,810
我以圣母之名，起誓.
Does Escobedo ring a bell? Miranda?

564
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:43,140
你一定知道第四修正案!
You must have heard of the 4th Amendment!

565
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,690
我要说的是,人都有权利.
What I'm saying is, that man had rights.

566
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,000
我完全糊涂了,哪个人的权利？
I'm all broken up about that man's rights.

567
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:55,960
你应该知道. 我告诉你个新消息.
You should be. I've got news for you.

568
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,720
他已经离开医院了,他被释放了.
When he's well enough to leave the hospital, he walks.

569
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:01,750
你说什么?
What are you talking about?

570
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,910
他自由了!
He's free!

571
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,220
你把他放了?
You're letting him go?

572
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,040
我们必须那样做. 我们不能再扣留他.
We have to. We can't try him.

573
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:08,670
为什么?
And why is that?

574
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,030
我不能用50万元纳税人的钱...
Because I'm not wasting 1/2 million tax dollars...

575
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,260
...去打一场不可能赢得官司.
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

576
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,970
问题就是我们没有证据.
The problem is, we don't have any evidence.

577
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,160
那些又是什么?
What do you call that?

578
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,320
我说那些什么都不是.
I call it nothing.

579
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,130
什么都不是.
Zero.

580
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,660
你说专家认为子弹和枪不吻和?
You're saying that Ballistics can't match the bullet up to this rifle?

581
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:30,720
专家说的算不了什么!
It does not matter what Ballistics can do!

582
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,900
这把枪或许可以是个不错的收藏品.
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

583
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,270
- 但是不足以作为证据! - 谁说的?
- But it's inadmissible as evidence! - Who says?

584
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:38,820
法律.
It's the law.

585
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,020
法律一定是疯了!
Then the law is crazy!

586
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,970
这是法院的检察长.
This is Judge Bannerman of the appellate court.

587
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:49,970
他对宪法的了如指掌. 我咨询过他的看法.
He also holds classes in constitutional law. I've asked him for an opinion.

588
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,400
你能谈谈?
Your Honor?

589
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,430
据我所知这次搜查是违法的.
In my opinion, the search of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

590
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:02,110
从而这些证据都是违法的...
Evidence obtained thereby, such as that hunting rifle for instance...

591
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,100
...不足以作为证据.
...is inadmissible in court.

592
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:08,690
我十分遗憾.你应该拿到搜查证再去的.
You should have gotten a search warrant. I'm sorry.

593
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:11,920
- 就是这样. - 搜查证? 一个女孩子已经死了!
- It's that simple. - Search warrant? A girl was dying!

594
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,310
根据医学报告，她确实死了.
She was, in fact, dead according to the medical report!

595
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,610
但是我不知道这件事!
But I didn't know that!

596
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:22,010
法院会同情警官对女孩的关心...
The court would recognize the officer's legitimate concern for the girl...

597
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,560
...但不会因此宽恕他们施暴.
...but there is no way they can possibly condone police torture.

598
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,690
所有关于女孩的证据如嫌犯的证词...
All evidence concerning the girl, the suspect's confession...

599
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,360
...还有物证...
...physical evidence...

600
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,630
...都不会被采纳.
...would have to be excluded.

601
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,560
你能控告他么!
You can get him on something!

602
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,240
没有了女孩和枪?
Without the evidence of the gun and the girl?

603
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,660
我总不能控告 他在人行道上吐痰吧!
I couldn't convict him of spitting on the sidewalk!

604
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,620
现在, 嫌犯的权利...
Now, the suspect's rights...

605
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,490
...被亵渎了...
...were violated...

606
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,050
...在第四第五...
...under the 4th and 5th...

607
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,950
...或者是第六第十四修正法案下.
...and probably the 6th and 14th Amendments.

608
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,880
那么那个女孩呢, 她的权利呢?
And Ann-Mary Deacon, what about her rights?

609
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:07,570
她被强奸并死在了井里? 谁为她说话.
She's raped and left in a hole to die! Who speaks for her?

610
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,190
区检察院办公室.
The district attorney's office!

611
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,680
如果你愿意让我们做的话.
If you'll let us.

612
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,740
我也有妻子和孩子. 我想把他抓起来的心情比你急切.
I have a wife and kids. I don't want him on the streets any more than you do.

613
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,990
他不会子外面呆很久的.
He won't be out there long.

614
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,220
你是什么意思?
What is that supposed to mean?

615
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,590
不久他会打断自己的腿. 我会在现场.
Sooner or later he will stub his toe and I'll be there.

616
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,530
这里不会容忍任何私刑的!
This office won't stand for any harassment!

617
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,340
如果你认为这是他最后一次 你一定是疯了.他还会杀人的.
You're crazy if you think you've heard the last of him. He will kill again.

618
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,310
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

619
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,190
因为他热衷杀人.
Because he likes it.

620
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,470
你肯定没人跟踪?
You sure you weren't tailed?

621
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,920
是的.
Yeah.

622
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:36,330
你真的要200美元的？
You really want $200 worth.

623
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,700
是的.
Every penny of it.

624
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,050
享受为你的服务吧.
Might as well be comfortable.

625
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,300
来吧, 坐.
Go on, sit.

626
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,430
别紧张.
Relax.

627
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,670
放松.
Take it easy.

628
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,950
都会好的.
It's going to be all right.

629
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,970
你肯定你还要？
You sure you want the rest of it?

630
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:58,700
给够每一分!
Every penny's worth!

631
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,860
你这个黑狗!
You black son of a bitch!

632
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,070
这是免费的.
This one's on the house.

633
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,130
就是他.
That's got to be him.

634
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,380
你说这是旧金山警局对你做的么?
Are you claiming that the San Francisco Police did this to you?

635
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,940
我发誓. 上帝会给我作证.
I swear it. As God is my judge.

636
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,100
为什么他们打你?
Why are they harassing you?

637
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,580
他们要设计陷害我谋杀罪.
They tried to frame me with the murder.

638
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,860
现在他们做到了. 看看我!
And now they're trying to murder me. And look at me!

639
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:05,130
在我被证明有罪之前，我都是清白的. 但看看他们对我所做的一切.
I'm supposed to be innocent until proven guilty and look at what they did to me.

640
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,550
我无论去哪他都跟着我. 监视我.
Everywhere I go cops follow me. And just look at me!

641
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,820
等一会, 护士. 让我再问一个问题.
Just a minute, nurse. Let me ask him one more question.

642
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,520
- 你知道谁揍得你么? - 是的.
- Did you see who did this to you? - Yes.

643
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,970
你认识他?
Can you identify him?

644
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:21,050
他是克拉汉.他是个警察 专业杀人犯.科拉汉.
His name is Callahan. He's a big cop. Works Homicide. Callahan.

645
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,970
看,那是四点的新闻的重播.
Now, that's the reruns from the 4 o'clock news.

646
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,200
他还在时报上登了个声明.
Since then he's given a statement to The Chronicle.

647
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,500
他说你跟踪他并把他揍了.
He claims you've been following him. And beat him up.

648
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,220
是那么回事么,哈里?
What about it, Harry?

649
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,200
- 你要收我的勋章? - 我要你回答.
- You want my star? - I want an answer.

650
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,500
你跟踪他了么?
Have you been following him?

651
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:46,330
我下班后跟踪他.
Yeah, I've been following him on my own time.

652
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,660
- 任何人都知道我没揍他. - 为什么?
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that. - How?

653
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,660
因为他那样子还是太漂亮了 这就是为什么!
Because he looks too damn good, that's how!

654
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,040
在你走之前 我们要讲明一件事.
Before I let you go, let's get one thing straight.

655
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,770
不得再有监视行为!
I don't want any more surveillance!

656
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,760
他也不得有.
Neither does he.

657
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,460
什么意思?
What does that mean?

658
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,620
晚安,先生.
Good night, sir.

659
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:13,340
去,试试.
Go ahead. Try them.

660
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,150
- 我经常吃饭的地方给做的. - 谢谢.
- Guy makes them where I always eat. - Thank you.

661
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,970
我和布来希勒谈过 一起搭档的事.
I talked to Bressler about being on with me.

662
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,240
等你出来继续和我干吧.
So you know you got a spot when you get out.

663
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,280
我不知道我是否还回去.哈里.
I don't know if I am coming back, Harry.

664
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:33,260
我仔细考虑了一下...
Doing a lot of thinking about it and...

665
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,760
我还有个教师资格证.... 我的意思是...
I have a teaching credential. And I figure...

666
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,910
...那是为什么? 你明白么?
...what for? You know?

667
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,620
- 现在是治疗的时间了. - 你如今陷进去了.
- Time for therapy. - You hang in there now.

668
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,040
再见,亲爱的.

669
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,660
明天这个时候见.
See you tomorrow. Same time?

670
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,840
- 你知道这是我的错. - 什么你的错?
- It's my fault, you know. - What?

671
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,830
他的辞职. 我原以为我会无所谓...
His leaving. I thought I could take it.

672
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,300
他不教书.
No class.

673
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,100
- 不要那么说. - 为什么?
- Don't ever say that. - What?

674
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,530
任何时候都不要对自己失望.
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

675
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:36,970
我的意思是 无论如何作为一个警察的妻子...
What I meant was, whatever it takes to be a cop's wife...

676
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,300
...我不知能否能够胜任.
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

677
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:42,080
他尽力了, 但是那些混蛋总是...
He really tries, and all these bastards...

678
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,450
...鸡蛋里面挑骨头.
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

679
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,620
或许我晚上看着他出门.
But maybe it's when I watch him walk out that door at night.

680
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,920
我想...
And I think...

681
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,790
...可能那是最后一次看到他!
...what if it's the last time I see him?

682
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,280
就我一个人这样么?
Am I the only one?

683
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,550
你的老婆不会吗?
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

684
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,670
不.
No.

685
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,080
她习惯了?
You mean she got used to it?

686
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,370
不,她从没有习惯过,真的.
No, she never did, really.

687
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,030
那为什么?
What then?

688
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,450
她死了.
She's dead.

689
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,690
对不起,原谅我.
Please, forgive me.

690
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,850
她驾车回家的路上， 一个酒鬼驾车越过中线.
She was driving home and a drunk crossed the center line.

691
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,540
没什么,真的.
No reason for it, really.

692
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,610
- 我很抱歉. - 没关系.
- I'm so sorry. - That's okay.

693
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,990
我要你告诉奇科...
I want you to tell Chico...

694
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,250
...我理解他辞职.
...that I understand him quitting.

695
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,510
他是对的. 这不是你们两个该过的生活.
I think he's right. This is no life for you two.

696
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:34,310
- 那你为什么还干这行? - 我也不知道.
- Why do you stay in it, then? - I don't know.

697
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,420
我真的不知道.
I really don't.

698
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,040
给我一瓶五级的格莱姆酒. 稍等.
Let me have a 5th of Seagram's. Please.

699
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,140
你怎么了?
What the hell happened to you?

700
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,100
我妻子的兄弟干的
My wife's brother.

701
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:24,030
我打了她...
I hit her...

702
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,230
...他就揍了我.
...so he hit me.

703
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,720
好几次了.
Several times.

704
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,650
5.69美元.
$5.69.

705
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,770
你是不是被抢了好几次了.
You're the guy that's been robbed all these times.

706
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,460
最近三年里14次了.
14 times the last 3 years.

707
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,480
不过最近两次混蛋们都是从担架上出去的.
Last 2 times, they sent them out here on platters.

708
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,390
我枪法很棒.
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

709
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:49,380
我总把它放在这. 就在这,很顺手.
And I always keep it right here. Right where it's handy.

710
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:52,380
别开玩笑,我胆子小。
Please, I scare easy.

711
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:57,310
贱货生的狗杂种！强盗！
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

712
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,000
再见了.

713
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:39,050
明天见.
See you tomorrow.

714

要下车的快点下.
Everybody out who gets out here?

715

我是校车调查员。

716
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,230
等一下.我没有权力让任何人包括...

717
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:57,960
那我来授权你,快走.
I'm authorizing it, so go.

718
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,760
你在干什么？ 我不认识你.
What are you doing? I don't know you.

719

- Where? - Just get started. I'll tell you where.

现在我们来活跃一下气氛.
Let's have some fun now.

722
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,330
谁会唱歌？
Who knows a song?

723
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:21,520
每个人都会.你怎么样？ 你一定唱得很好听！
Everybody knows a song. You? You must know a beautiful one.

724
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,310
来吧,唱一个给我们听听.
Come on, sing for us.

725
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,190
老麦有个农场...

726
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,200

- Who's he grabbed now? - That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

732

飞机一定要在半小时内就绪.
The jet must be fueled and ready to go in 1/2 an hour.

告诉他们那个人很危险.

When will you stop messing around with this guy? He has to be stopped now!

轻轻的划着小船...

792
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,990
走右手的通道.
Get in the right-hand lane.

793
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:10,740
不能那样对待孩子.
Not right to treat children that way.

794
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:13,670
- 你会伤害他们. - 开你的车吧！
- You'll hurt them. - Just drive the goddamn bus!

795
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,730
走右手的通道！
And get in the right-hand lane!

796
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:24,760
我要妈妈！
I want my mother.

797
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:34,749
看到路标,斯达克布韦德.
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

798
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,230
在那右转.
Make a right there.

799
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,540
不是这里.
Not this one.

800
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,840
我要妈妈.
I want my mother.

801
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:46,810
闭上嘴！
Shut up!

802
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,519
赶快右转.
Just get to the right!

803
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,050
天啊！
Jesus!

804
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,090
他到底在哪干什么？
What the hell is he doing up there?

805
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:25,190
你到底在干什么？ 你能不能超过那辆大众车？
What the hell are you doing? Pass the V.W., will you?

806
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:46,920
放下枪,趴下！
Drop the gun, creep!

807
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:50,950
我会把他的头打烂！
I'll blow his brains out.

808
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,820
把那该死的枪放下！
Drop the fucking gun!

809
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,930
我知道你在想什么,人渣！
I know what your thinking, punk.

810
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,590
"这个人是开了六枪还是五枪？
You're thinking: "Did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?"

811
01:39:51,239 --> 01:39:54,639
告你你吧,我太兴奋了,不记得了
To tell you the truth, I forgot myself, in all this excitement.

812
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:59,950
但在我拿着这把44毫米口径的转轮手枪, 世界上威力最大的手枪...
But being this is a.44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun...

813
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:02,750
...可以彻底打爆你的头情况下...
...and will blow your head clean off...

814
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,820
...你该问问自己...
...you've got to ask yourself...

815
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,860
...我今天走运么？...
..."Do I feel lucky?"

816
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,950
你走运么,人渣？
Well, do you, punk?
