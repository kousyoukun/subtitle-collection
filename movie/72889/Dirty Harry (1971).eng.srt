1
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,500
Jesus!

2
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,007
"To the city of San Francisco.

3
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:49,630
I will enjoy killing
one person every day...

4
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,926
...until you pay me
one hundred thousand dollars.

5
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:56,305
If you agree,
say so tomorrow morning...

6
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,565
<i>...at personal column,
San Francisco Chronicle...</i>

7
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,643
...and I will set up meeting.

8
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,527
If I do not hear from you...

9
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,399
...it'll be my next pleasure
to kill a Catholic priest or a..."

10
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,361
"Scorpio."

11
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,284
What goes on in their minds?

12
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,787
Kooks.

13
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,958
Where the hell does he expect me to
find a hundred thousand dollars?

14
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,666
You're not thinking of paying him,
are you, Mr. Mayor?

15
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,800
The City of San Francisco does not
pay criminals not to commit crimes.

16
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,932
Instead, we pay a police department.

17
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,345
Chief, who's in charge of this case?

18
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,397
Inspector Callahan.
He's outside.

19
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,943
Send Inspector Callahan in.

20
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:51,525
Callahan?

21
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,114
Mr. Mayor, Inspector Callahan.

22
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,489
All right.

23
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,913
Let's have it.

24
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,462
- Have what?
- Your report. What have you been doing?

25
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,333
For the past 3/4 hour...

26
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,510
...I've been sitting on my ass
waiting on you.

27
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,633
Damn it, Harry.
It's the mayor you're talking to.

28
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:17,435
Won't you sit down, Inspector Callahan?

29
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,691
There's a madman loose.

30
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:33,202
I've asked you what's being done.
Fair enough?

31
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,496
We've got a dozen men
checking identification files.

32
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:43,336
Checking on all known extortionists,
rooftop prowlers...

33
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,789
...rifle nuts, peepers...

34
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,627
Mr. Mayor?

35
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,922
We've arranged for rooftop
surveillance and helicopters...

36
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,757
...especially around
the Catholic churches and schools...

37
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,554
...and in the black area.

38
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,099
Ballistics is checking on the slug.

39
00:07:58,355 --> 00:07:59,731
We're sure it's a 30-06.

40
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,852
Seven lands and grooves,
right-hand twist...

41
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,730
We're running a computer check...

42
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:08,820
...on everybody in the files
whose birthday falls between...

43
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,616
...October 23 and November 21.

44
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:11,864
Why?

45
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:13,901
Natives of Scorpio.

46
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:17,119
Thank you, inspector.

47
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,701
Have you mentioned this note to anyone?

48
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,756
How about you?

49
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,206
Nobody.

50
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,299
Your wife, sweetheart?
Press?

51
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,792
Nobody.

52
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:36,093
<i>All right. Give the message
to the Chronicle.</i>

53
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:39,640
We'll pay. But we need time
to get the money together.

54
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,855
Wait a minute. Do I get this right?

55
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,859
You'll play this creep's game?

56
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:45,902
It'll give us breathing space.

57
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:48,195
It might get somebody killed.

58
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:50,991
Let me meet with the son of a bitch!

59
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:54,908
Nope, none of that.
We would end up with a real bloodbath.

60
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,957
I agree with the chief.
We'll do it this way.

61
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,079
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Come on, Callahan, let's go.

62
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:11,466
I don't want trouble, like you had
last year in the Fillmore district.

63
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:13,717
That's my policy.

64
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:17,260
When an adult male
is chasing a female...

65
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,814
...with intent to commit rape,
I shoot the bastard. That's my policy.

66
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,686
Intent?

67
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:25,603
How did you establish that?

68
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:32,280
When a naked man chases a woman in
an alley with a knife and a hard-on...

69
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:35,987
...I figure he isn't out
collecting for the Red Cross.

70
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,708
I think he's got a point.

71
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,596
- Inspector Callahan.
- Jaffe.

72
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:41,352
Usual.

73
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,605
Usual lunch, or usual dinner?

74
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,359
What difference does it make?

75
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,607
Not much.

76
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,569
Hey, Jaffe...

77
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:56,567
...is that tan Ford still
in front of the bank?

78
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:59,904
Tan Ford?

79
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,035
Yeah, tan Ford.

80
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,082
Engine running?

81
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,134
I don't know.
How can I tell?

82
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,922
- Exhaust fumes out of the tailpipe.
- That's awful!

83
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,181
Look at that pollution.

84
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,271
Do me a favor, will you?

85
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,315
Call this telephone number.

86
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,309
Police Department?

87
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:31,322
Tell them Inspector Callahan
thinks there's a...

88
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,908
...two-eleven in progress
at the bank. Got it?

89
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:37,701
Got it.

90
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:41,206
Be sure and tell them
it's in progress, right?

91
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:44,248
In progress.
Yes, sir.

92
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:53,419
Now, if they'll just wait
till the cavalry arrives.

93
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,641
Shit!

94
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:12,653
Halt!

95
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:39,489
I know what you're thinking.

96
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,082
Did he fire six shots or only five?

97
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:47,452
To tell the truth, in the excitement
I kind of lost track myself.

98
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:50,964
This is a.44 Magnum, the most
powerful handgun in the world...

99
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:53,506
...and would blow
your head clean off...

100
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:58,009
...you've got to ask yourself
one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

101
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,891
Well, do you, punk?

102
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,867
I got to know.

103
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,849
Son of a bitch!

104
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:50,273
It looks like we can save that leg.

105
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:52,437
I've got a couple under my knee.

106
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,441
Ever consider
another line of work?

107
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,109
I really appreciate this, Steve.

108
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,819
We Potrero Hill boys
have to stick together.

109
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,699
Nothing fancy, now.

110
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:05,539
Just a little tweezers
and Mercurochrome.

111
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:08,795
Do I tell you how to beat a confession
out of a prisoner?

112
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:13,342
- I haven't got all night.
- You might experience discomfort.

113
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:17,218
But if you do,
just have your wife fix a...

114
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,551
Sorry, Harry.

115
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:22,508
- What will you do with those?
- Cut your pants off.

116
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,023
- No. We'll pull them off.
- It'll hurt.

117
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,765
For $29.50, let it hurt.

118
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:31,564
You can turn your back
if you're embarrassed.

119
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,694
- Good morning, inspector.
- Maria.

120
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,036
You wanted to see me, lieutenant?

121
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,376
When the hell
you going to get a haircut?

122
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,505
Whenever you do.

123
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:17,839
Who's got time? I was up till 3 a.m.
Checking the search patterns.

124
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:21,383
- Put in for overtime.
- That'll be the day.

125
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,849
You made a good pinch.
Chief was pleased.

126
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:27,223
- He was?
- He said to say, "Well done!"

127
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,474
I can't tell you how moved I am.

128
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,774
I pass along a compliment...

129
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:35,896
...you could be a little polite.
It might not kill you to say thanks.

130
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:38,114
I'd rather say thanks to a raise.

131
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:42,661
Harry, check communications.
Something from Chicago. A gun nut.

132
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:45,868
- I'll get right on it.
- Now wait a minute!

133
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:47,620
I'm putting somebody
with you.

134
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:56,380
- What are you talking about?
- You need a partner.

135
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:00,174
- What's wrong with the one I've got?
- He's in the hospital!

136
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:04,016
- He'll be out in a few weeks.
- Say hello to Chico Gonzales.

137
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:06,897
- He'll be working with you.
- You must be kidding.

138
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,270
I have no time to break in newcomers.

139
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,728
- Why don't you do this boy a favor?
- What do you mean?

140
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:17,193
You know what happens to guys I worked
with. Deitzick's in the hospital...

141
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:18,736
...and Fanduchi's dead.

142
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,238
So?

143
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:25,031
If I need a partner, I'll get me one
who knows what he's doing.

144
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,489
What about De Georgio?

145
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,031
No way!

146
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,452
You work with Gonzales
or you don't work.

147
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,753
Straight from the fifth floor.
Got it?

148
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:36,916
I got it.

149
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,091
If you see De Georgio,
send him in here!

150
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,105
You from around here?

151
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,478
Yeah, but I went to San Jose State.

152
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:53,184
- Play ball?
- No, I boxed. Light heavyweight.

153
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,363
Just what I need is a college boy.

154
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,529
- Found anything you like about me yet?
- It's early yet.

155
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,991
- Get your degree?
- Sociology.

156
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:06,782
Sociology! You'll go far, if you live.

157
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,199
I intend to.

158
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,625
Inspector Callahan.

159
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,580
Don't let your degree get you killed.
I'm liable to get killed with you.

160
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,122
I'll remember that.

161
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:21,337
- Hero! Nice work yesterday.
- Fatso! Bressler wants to see you.

162
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,465
You're a sweet man, Harry.

163
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:32,062
There is one question,
Inspector Callahan.

164
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,477
Why do they call you Dirty Harry?

165
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,528
That's one thing about our Harry.

166
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,026
Doesn't play favorites.

167
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:42,826
Harry hates everybody: Limeys, micks,
hebes, dagos, niggers, honkies, chinks.

168
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:44,611
You name it.

169
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:48,822
- How does he feel about Mexicans?
- Ask him!

170
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,543
Especially spics.

171
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,474
Hey! There's a guy
on the roof over there!

172
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,641
On Stockton Street
by Washington Square.

173
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:14,124
<i>You, on the roof!</i>

174
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,161
<i>You, there!</i>

175
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:18,126
<i>Yes, you.
Stop what you're doing.</i>

176
00:23:18,384 --> 00:23:21,135
<i>Turn around
and put your hands in the air.</i>

177
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:41,688
<i>I don 't know
how the helicopter boys lost him!</i>

178
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:44,945
How could they let him get out
without seeing him?

179
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:48,987
They were probably talking instead of
looking, like they were supposed to.

180
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:50,873
That's possible.

181
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,592
<i>- Attention, all units.
- Turn that thing up louder.</i>

182
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:06,554
<i>Prowler last seen
in the vicinity of Washington Square.</i>

183
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:07,922
<i>He is an adult male.</i>

184
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:11,850
<i>Caucasian. Repeat,
adult male Caucasian.</i>

185
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:14,394
<i>When last seen,
he was wearing tan chinos...</i>

186
00:24:14,608 --> 00:24:18,476
<i>... pale blue shirt, brown coat
or sweater, dark gloves.</i>

187
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:20,065
<i>He had a tan suitcase...</i>

188
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:24,569
<i>... which probably contains a
30-06 rifle. He's wanted...</i>

189
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:28,243
Those loonies! They ought to throw
a net over the whole bunch!

190
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:30,374
I know what you mean.

191
00:24:33,836 --> 00:24:35,414
- There!
- What?

192
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,338
Tan suitcase.

193
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:40,004
- Where?
- I lost him.

194
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:43,678
There he goes, over there.

195
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,257
Does that bag look tan?

196
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,762
I don't know,
I haven't even seen him yet.

197
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,719
Go to Filbert and hang a left.

198
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,555
Look out for these people!

199
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:54,932
- Fruitcake!
- Get out of the way, hammerhead!

200
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:02,445
It was a tan suitcase.
I know it was.

201
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,901
I saw him.

202
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,785
- There he is.
- I see him.

203
00:25:10,624 --> 00:25:12,415
<i>Car 2, the license number...</i>

204
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,503
<i>... at 10-32 on that Chevrolet,
Colorado plates.</i>

205
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:24,759
- How do you want to work this?
- Find another entrance. I'll go here.

206
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:27,927
<i>Car 2, what's the model
of that Chevrolet?</i>

207
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:33,646
<i>Car 2. It's an Impala convertible.</i>

208
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,513
<i>10-4.</i>

209
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:50,740
<i>You can cancel that 10-25.
Three cars here.</i>

210
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,438
Anybody home?

211
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,708
- I brought you a nice present.
- Let me see it.

212
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:03,149
It's beautiful! Why don't you go get
a nice container of egg rolls?

213
00:27:08,661 --> 00:27:10,204
You getting an eyeful?

214
00:27:10,455 --> 00:27:12,662
You goddamn pie hawker!

215
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:15,289
- We should call the police.
- I am a police...

216
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,962
Up against the wall.
Right now! Move.

217
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,801
- Let them go.
- Let them go?

218
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,725
- You heard me.
- They assaulted a police officer.

219
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,144
A police officer!
He was standing on a can peeking in...

220
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,317
...on Hot Mary and her boyfriend!

221
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:42,988
Beat it. Get out of here.

222
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:50,864
- How about the man with the suitcase?
- Wrong number.

223
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:54,038
I just had another thought.

224
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,750
Yeah? About what?

225
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:58,457
About why
they call you Dirty Harry.

226
00:28:05,261 --> 00:28:07,005
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

227
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,679
<i>Inspector 71.
Please respond to your call.</i>

228
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:16,100
<i>Inspector 71.
Do you read me?</i>

229
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:20,231
<i>- This is Inspector 71.
- I've got an 8-0-4 in progress.</i>

230
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:23,155
<i>California Hall
at Polk and Turk streets.</i>

231
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:25,196
10-4. We're on our way.

232
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,543
It's some idiot.

233
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:49,888
Where? I don't see him.

234
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,851
- There he is.
- Yeah. Now I see him.

235
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>I have a 10-29 and a 10-28.</i>

236
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:02,025
<i>In 600 block of Baker.
On a Chevrolet.</i>

237
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:07,071
<i>California license D-dog,
C- Charles, V-Victor 4-7-2.</i>

238
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:19,705
We thought it was your sniper, but
it turned out to be a suicide attempt.

239
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:37,556
- Anybody try to talk him down?
- Yeah, no luck. But now you're here...

240
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,602
- You mean, I go up.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

241
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,926
Don't you try to get me!

242
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,847
Not me. You're the one who
wants to get yourself killed. Not me.

243
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,150
Always happens with you guys.
The last minute you want to...

244
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:09,399
...grab onto somebody, take somebody
with you. Down you go. Not me!

245
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,654
Won't you try to grab me?

246
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,788
A friend of mine was up about 20
floors with a jumper a few years ago.

247
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,243
The jumper grabbed him
and they went off.

248
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,535
Mashed all over.

249
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,008
Couldn't tell which legs was
with which, which arms with which...

250
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,551
It was a terrible mess.
I tell you, I almost threw up myself.

251
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:33,389
- I'd just like your name and address.
- Why?

252
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,885
It's a mess down there afterwards!
It makes identification impossible.

253
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,270
Even if they find
your driver's license!

254
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,899
All that blood!

255
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,777
I think I'm going to puke!

256
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,692
Don't do that, son. All those people
down there looking up.

257
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,865
The fire chief looking up.
With his face...

258
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,738
You bastard!

259
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:46,205
Get the stretcher up here.

260
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:01,274
Now you know why I'm called
Dirty Harry.

261
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,938
Every dirty job that comes along.

262
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,791
<i>Inspector 71.</i>

263
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:22,329
This is Inspector 71.

264
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:27,131
<i>Got something for you. Corner of
Sierra and Texas. A young boy, Negro.</i>

265
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:30,544
What about him?

266
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:33,551
Shot in the face.
Blew part of it away.

267
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,516
Anybody know who the boy is?

268
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:39,893
His name was Charlie Russell.

269
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:41,766
I'm his mother.

270
00:33:42,483 --> 00:33:45,519
He's only 10 years old.

271
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,044
Inspector, this officer...
Oh, Jesus Christ!

272
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,453
You'd better go check on the mother.

273
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:18,092
What do you have?

274
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:21,394
<i>That 30-06 shell casing.</i>

275
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:23,439
<i>He was up here all right.</i>

276
00:34:28,113 --> 00:34:29,691
Welcome to Homicide.

277
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:53,215
The man who designed blue serge
uniforms for police departments...

278
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,716
...has to sell these for a living!

279
00:35:00,354 --> 00:35:02,596
.458 Magnum?

280
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:07,610
- This thing will stop an elephant.
- Yeah.

281
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,527
- Apparently you like a little edge.
- All I can get, sir.

282
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:15,951
He's no elephant, Harry.
He's no animal of any kind.

283
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:17,829
What have you got, lieutenant?

284
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:22,458
The blue flags represent the units that
will be on duty by dark tonight.

285
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,952
- Double shifts and overtime.
- At nighttime.

286
00:35:25,213 --> 00:35:28,000
Daylight, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

287
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:32,339
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

288
00:35:32,595 --> 00:35:35,134
- Except here.
- Right. The North Beach area.

289
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,051
We're saving that for him.

290
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,889
- Have you found a good stakeout?
- I think so.

291
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:44,226
It's a building that overlooks the
roof where they spotted him yesterday.

292
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:46,483
Something bothering you?

293
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,605
- Nothing.
- Speak up. You're among friends here.

294
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:53,943
It seems a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

295
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,368
There are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

296
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,115
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

297
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,245
These sick guys have behavior patterns.

298
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:09,336
We know they'll rob the very
same store 3, 4 times in a row.

299
00:36:09,592 --> 00:36:12,083
Must appeal to their
superego or something.

300
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:14,671
Scorpio strikes again.

301
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:17,299
They like that feeling.

302
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:21,141
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

303
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:24,433
He's got a clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

304
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:26,815
And they're having a novena tonight.

305
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:28,647
Go on.

306
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:32,196
The note. He threatened
to kill a priest or a Negro.

307
00:36:32,449 --> 00:36:34,073
The Russell boy was black.

308
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:38,074
<i>He may just figure
he owes himself a padre.</i>

309
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,338
Inspector 71.

310
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:59,013
We're in position
to start our surveillance.

311
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,116
How about the priest?

312
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:27,669
- He knows he's being set up for bait?
- Yeah, he wanted to.

313
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:31,919
We told him we had a volunteer
willing to take his place.

314
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:33,625
Who?

315
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:36,587
Never guess.

316
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,261
Yeah, I know.
Welcome to Homicide.

317
00:39:11,404 --> 00:39:14,903
You owe it to yourself
to live a little, Harry.

318
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,503
Son of a bitch took the bait!

319
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:35,795
When I say "now,"
hit him with the light.

320
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:18,677
Now!

321
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:01,508
- You all right?
- I think so.

322
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:57,901
Call an ambulance.

323
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:01,200
Collins never knew what hit him.

324
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,834
Let's go. Clear the alley.
There's nothing to see.

325
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:11,334
Call headquarters.
He's loose in North Beach.

326
00:42:58,512 --> 00:43:00,635
It's a whole new ball game, fellows.

327
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:04,048
He grabbed a 14-year-old girl.

328
00:43:05,728 --> 00:43:06,891
Ann Mary Deacon.

329
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:10,765
The bomb squad got a call.
Suspicious object in Golden Gate Park.

330
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:15,651
It was addressed to the mayor. The lab
sent it to us, with this letter inside.

331
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,696
"Ann Mary Deacon, buried alive."

332
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:21,365
The poor kid went to the movies
last night and never came home.

333
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:25,490
"Double-crossing San Francisco police
made me do this.

334
00:43:25,748 --> 00:43:29,449
Now ransom $200,000,
in used tens and twenties.

335
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:31,504
One man with yellow bag.

336
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:34,590
South side Marina.
Green East Harbor.

337
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:36,252
9 p.m.

338
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:38,674
She has oxygen
till 3 a.m. Tomorrow.

339
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:41,550
Red panties and bra. Nice tits.

340
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:45,597
Mole on left thigh. Anything cute
and you'll force me to let girl die...

341
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:48,433
...of slow suffocation.
Signed, Scorpio."

342
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:51,979
Anything else?

343
00:43:53,736 --> 00:43:56,061
The mother identified the bra...

344
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:57,946
...the hank of hair...

345
00:43:58,324 --> 00:43:59,487
...and that.

346
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,366
The dentist identified that.

347
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,778
Said it was pulled out
with a pair of pliers.

348
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:08,990
You know she's dead.

349
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:13,629
All I know is the letter says
she'll be alive until 3 a.m.

350
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,375
The mayor's out trying to
put the money together now.

351
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:20,840
He's using up a lot of favors.

352
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:24,593
He wants to pay.

353
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:27,852
No tricks.

354
00:44:33,943 --> 00:44:35,902
We need a bag man.
You want the job?

355
00:44:38,114 --> 00:44:39,028
You got it.

356
00:44:39,282 --> 00:44:42,367
- Be in the chief's office at 6 p.m.
- All right.

357
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:45,241
- Wait a minute. What about me?
- You're out.

358
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:47,241
No cover?
Not even one man?

359
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:50,996
Sure that's how to do it?

360
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:54,165
I'm not sure!
But those are my orders. All right?

361
00:44:56,217 --> 00:45:00,546
No wonder they call him Dirty Harry.
He gets the shit end of the stick.

362
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:03,591
One more word and you're
chopped off at the ankles.

363
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:07,560
Al, let's split the difference.
Give him the night off.

364
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:10,680
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

365
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:24,234
Testing 1, 2, 3...

366
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:27,864
- What are you yelling for?
- All you have to do is whisper.

367
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:31,085
"Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece as white as snow."

368
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:32,919
Okay, that's better.

369
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,083
It's good for 2 or 3 blocks.
But in a tunnel...

370
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,710
...forget it.

371
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:40,132
All right, Sid.
What do I owe you?

372
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:42,545
Bring it back in one piece.

373
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:48,470
$200,000.

374
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:50,721
Count it and sign for it.

375
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,274
Did you count it out?

376
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,606
Did you count it, chief?

377
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,614
It's not my responsibility.

378
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:09,288
Always knew I'd get rich
on the police force.

379
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:15,329
Just make sure
nobody takes it away from you.

380
00:46:18,468 --> 00:46:22,418
God knows how he'll contact you.
He'll probably run you all over town.

381
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,052
Go where you're told.
Do what you're told.

382
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,434
Play it straight down the line. Okay?

383
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:39,776
Nothing cute.
Nothing fancy.

384
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:43,317
Just pay the ransom money
and report back here.

385
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:49,075
Would you mind if I borrowed
a little Scotch tape?

386
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,592
It's disgusting that a police officer
should know how to use that weapon.

387
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:11,954
<i>- You got a yellow suitcase?
- Yeah, I got it right with me.</i>

388
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:17,538
<i>- What's your name?
- Callahan.</i>

389
00:48:17,798 --> 00:48:20,420
<i>- What are you?
- Police officer.</i>

390
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,380
Hello?

391
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,099
<i>All right, police officer...</i>

392
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:38,186
<i>... this is how we play.</i>

393
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:42,612
<i>I bounce you all over town
to make sure you're alone.</i>

394
00:48:43,158 --> 00:48:46,242
<i>If I even think you're being followed,
the girl dies.</i>

395
00:48:46,494 --> 00:48:50,622
<i>If you talk to anyone, even if it's
a Pekinese pissing on a lamppost...</i>

396
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,369
<i>... the girl dies.</i>

397
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:55,710
<i>- Is the girl okay?
- Just shut up and listen.</i>

398
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:57,284
<i>No car.</i>

399
00:48:57,798 --> 00:49:01,463
<i>I give you some time
to go from phone booth to phone booth.</i>

400
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:05,295
<i>I ring 4 times.
You don 't answer by the fourth ring...</i>

401
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,549
<i>... that's the end of the game.</i>

402
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:09,600
<i>The girl dies.</i>

403
00:49:09,852 --> 00:49:11,726
<i>What time you got?</i>

404
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:16,016
<i>- 9:30. Now listen...
- You listen.</i>

405
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:18,312
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

406
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:22,563
<i>Not all the time,
but you'll never know when or where.</i>

407
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:28,036
<i>Now get to Forest Hills Station
as fast as you can. Understand?</i>

408
00:49:33,876 --> 00:49:36,831
<i>- Yeah.
- I hope you're not stupid.</i>

409
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,756
<i>Downstairs.
Take the "K" car.</i>

410
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:23,756
<i>Get off at Church and 20th.
Hurry up, or you'll blow it.</i>

411
00:52:29,557 --> 00:52:31,430
<i>You sound like you had a good rest.</i>

412
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:35,468
<i>You'll need it. I'm going to give you
a nice little run this time.</i>

413
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:39,104
<i>You better make it,
because if you don 't, dead girl!</i>

414
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,562
<i>Public phone,
hamburger stand, Aquatic Park.</i>

415
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,901
<i>Hubba-hubba-hubba, pig bastard.</i>

416
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,438
What's in the bag, man?

417
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:27,900
- You dudes get lost now, you hear?
- Screw the bag!

418
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:29,534
Just give us the wallet.

419
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:35,033
You don't listen, do you, asshole?

420
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:04,859
Don't answer that!

421
00:54:13,998 --> 00:54:18,458
<i>- Who picked it up?
- Some old guy. Never saw him before.</i>

422
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,006
<i>Chico, he hung up.</i>

423
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:29,800
<i>- You know Mt. Davidson Park?
- Yeah.</i>

424
00:54:30,056 --> 00:54:31,300
<i>Go to the cross.</i>

425
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:12,720
I'm at the entrance
on Lansdale Street.

426
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,765
<i>I'm going up.</i>

427
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,199
I see a couple of people.

428
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,409
Just a couple of kids necking.

429
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,074
Boys or girls?

430
00:55:58,647 --> 00:56:00,854
I'm Callahan.

431
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,895
My friends call me Alice.

432
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,946
And I will take a dare.

433
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,111
When was the last time
you were busted?

434
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:14,703
If you're a vice, I'll kill myself.

435
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,580
Well, do it at home.

436
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,310
Freeze!

437
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:24,185
Just like a statue.

438
00:57:25,152 --> 00:57:26,646
That's right.

439
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:30,317
One wrong move,
anything, I don't care.

440
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:33,245
I'll kill you and the girl both.

441
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:35,287
Understand?

442
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:37,993
Yeah.

443
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:40,871
Drop the bag.

444
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:45,834
Left hand.

445
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:48,007
Let's see the gun.

446
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:54,761
My!

447
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:56,885
That's a big one.

448
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:00,352
Left hand. Throw it.

449
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:02,893
Easy.

450
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:08,608
Raise your hands.

451
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:10,608
Come on, get them up.

452
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:15,651
Now turn.

453
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:17,704
Face the cross.

454
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,407
Come on.

455
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:24,456
Put your nose right up
against the cement.

456
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:50,566
You lift that hand once more and I
won't let you know where the girl is!

457
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,817
Do we understand each other?

458
00:58:53,785 --> 00:58:55,114
Do we understand each other?

459
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:58,531
Don't pass out on me yet!
No, no.

460
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:00,415
No, no. Not yet. Not yet!

461
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:02,825
Don't pass out on me yet,
you rotten oinker!

462
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:06,418
Do we understand each other?

463
00:59:07,216 --> 00:59:11,842
If you care what happens to the girl,
you'd better answer me! All right?

464
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:13,293
Listen to me carefully.

465
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:16,097
I've changed my mind.

466
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:18,344
I'm going to let her die.

467
00:59:20,313 --> 00:59:22,554
I just wanted you to know that.

468
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:31,523
<i>You understand? I just wanted to make
sure you knew that before I killed you.</i>

469
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,459
Goodbye, Callahan!

470
00:59:51,886 --> 00:59:53,678
Chico, don't kill him!

471
01:01:48,714 --> 01:01:52,084
The hospital report on Gonzales
looks okay, chief.

472
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:54,711
Yeah. Well, he's a pretty tough kid.

473
01:01:55,263 --> 01:01:56,591
He's right here.

474
01:01:56,848 --> 01:01:58,425
He's got two cracked ribs.

475
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:01,471
They want to do some more tests
on him in the morning.

476
01:02:01,728 --> 01:02:04,895
The son of a bitch really
kicked him a couple of beauts.

477
01:02:05,148 --> 01:02:06,394
I'm sending him home.

478
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:07,979
Right, chief.

479
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,854
He says beat it! That's an order.

480
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:16,567
The chief wants to know
if I misunderstood his orders.

481
01:02:16,827 --> 01:02:20,444
Meaning, am I just plain stupid
or did I deliberately disobey him?

482
01:02:20,705 --> 01:02:22,864
He wants to know
what Gonzales was doing there.

483
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,747
He wants to know
why we screwed everything up.

484
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,711
What am I going to tell him?

485
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,582
Why don't you start
by telling him the truth?

486
01:02:33,218 --> 01:02:36,422
Tell him Gonzales was obeying orders
from a superior. Me.

487
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:39,308
Tell him you didn't know
anything about it.

488
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:43,010
When this is over, if he wants
my badge, he can have that too.

489
01:02:45,064 --> 01:02:47,769
You wouldn't have a belt of booze
around here, would you?

490
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:56,941
Lieutenant Bressler's office.

491
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,869
- Put him on.
- What is it?

492
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:07,748
It's Park Emergency. They just treated
a guy who had a knife wound in the leg.

493
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:12,507
Yeah, Doctor?
What'd this guy look like?

494
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:14,878
Long blond hair...

495
01:03:15,137 --> 01:03:18,091
...medium build, about 150 pounds.

496
01:03:18,724 --> 01:03:19,921
Pale complexion.

497
01:03:20,183 --> 01:03:23,766
- He didn't give you his name, Doc?
- Nope.

498
01:03:24,897 --> 01:03:26,605
They usually give a phony name.

499
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:30,060
But I've seen him someplace.

500
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:34,739
It's important you remember. There's
a 14-year-old girl who's suffocating.

501
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,983
I'm trying to think!

502
01:03:37,243 --> 01:03:38,618
It was...

503
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,120
I believe he works around here.

504
01:03:41,331 --> 01:03:44,414
Doctor, could you give
him something? He's in pain!

505
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:46,327
Yes, just a moment.

506
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,049
She'll be dead in an hour!

507
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,340
I'm trying to remember!

508
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:58,630
I've got who he is.

509
01:03:59,474 --> 01:04:03,721
When they had football,
he used to sell programs at the stadium.

510
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:07,058
I think the groundskeeper
lets him live there.

511
01:04:07,315 --> 01:04:09,985
- Live where?
- There.

512
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,615
Kezar Stadium.

513
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:23,223
Illegal entry. No warrant.

514
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,304
Looks like we climb.

515
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,183
Too much linguine.

516
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,108
I'll find another way.

517
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,260
Stop!

518
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:13,414
Don't do anything more!
You tried to kill me!

519
01:09:14,797 --> 01:09:15,960
You need any help?

520
01:09:17,426 --> 01:09:21,554
- Go on and get some air, fatso.
- Please! No more!

521
01:09:21,972 --> 01:09:25,506
Can't you see I'm hurt?
You shot me! Please, don't!

522
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:28,217
Let me have a doctor!

523
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,017
Please, get me the doctor!
Don't kill me!

524
01:09:31,565 --> 01:09:33,143
The girl, where is she?

525
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,563
You tried to kill me!

526
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:38,981
If I did, your head would be splattered
all over this field. Where's the girl?

527
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,402
I want a lawyer.

528
01:09:40,616 --> 01:09:42,525
I said, where's the girl?

529
01:09:42,869 --> 01:09:46,035
- I have the right for one.
- Where's the girl?

530
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:49,531
I have the right to a lawyer!

531
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,960
Don't! Please!

532
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:54,749
I have rights. I want a lawyer!

533
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:35,598
Harry Callahan.
He said it was urgent.

534
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:39,857
Yes, the district attorney has
been wanting to talk to you.

535
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:43,359
<i>- It's Inspector Callahan.
- Have him come in, please.</i>

536
01:11:44,410 --> 01:11:46,617
Won't you come this way?

537
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:50,453
- May I bring you in a cup of coffee?
- No, thanks.

538
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:00,925
I'll be done in a minute.

539
01:12:01,677 --> 01:12:03,052
Have a seat.

540
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:10,974
I've just been looking over
your arrest report.

541
01:12:12,564 --> 01:12:15,933
A very unusual piece of police work.

542
01:12:17,694 --> 01:12:18,975
Really amazing.

543
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,483
I had some luck.

544
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:25,524
You're lucky I'm not indicting you for
assault with intent to commit murder!

545
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:33,293
Where does it say you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

546
01:12:33,544 --> 01:12:37,494
Deny medical attention and legal
counsel? Where have you been?

547
01:12:38,257 --> 01:12:40,962
Does Escobedo ring a bell?
Miranda?

548
01:12:42,762 --> 01:12:45,679
You must have heard
of the 4th Amendment!

549
01:12:47,098 --> 01:12:49,969
What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

550
01:12:51,354 --> 01:12:54,225
I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

551
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,765
You should be.
I've got news for you.

552
01:12:56,985 --> 01:12:59,689
When he's well enough
to leave the hospital, he walks.

553
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,524
What are you talking about?

554
01:13:02,782 --> 01:13:03,945
He's free!

555
01:13:04,784 --> 01:13:06,159
You're letting him go?

556
01:13:06,411 --> 01:13:08,203
We have to.
We can't try him.

557
01:13:08,455 --> 01:13:09,700
And why is that?

558
01:13:09,955 --> 01:13:12,957
Because I'm not wasting
1/2 million tax dollars...

559
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,451
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

560
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,459
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

561
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:21,586
- What do you call that?
- I call it nothing.

562
01:13:22,051 --> 01:13:23,249
Zero.

563
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:28,464
You're saying that Ballistics can't
match the bullet up to this rifle?

564
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:31,726
It does not matter
what Ballistics can do!

565
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:35,016
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

566
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:38,681
- But it's inadmissible as evidence!
- Who says?

567
01:13:38,944 --> 01:13:40,107
It's the law.

568
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,322
Then the law is crazy!

569
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:46,324
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

570
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:51,411
He holds classes in constitutional
law. I've asked him for an opinion.

571
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:52,745
Your Honor?

572
01:13:54,044 --> 01:13:58,871
In my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

573
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:03,302
Evidence obtained thereby, such as
that hunting rifle for instance...

574
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,420
...is inadmissible in court.

575
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,629
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry.

576
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,136
- It's that simple.
- Search warrant? A girl was dying!

577
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:16,439
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report!

578
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,854
But I didn't know that!

579
01:14:18,443 --> 01:14:23,271
The court would recognize the officer's
legitimate concern for the girl...

580
01:14:23,573 --> 01:14:27,737
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

581
01:14:28,453 --> 01:14:32,037
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

582
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:33,535
...physical evidence...

583
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,075
...would have to be excluded.

584
01:14:41,968 --> 01:14:44,044
There must be something
you can get him on!

585
01:14:44,262 --> 01:14:47,262
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

586
01:14:48,057 --> 01:14:50,809
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk!

587
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,927
Now, the suspect's rights...

588
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,980
...were violated...

589
01:14:57,232 --> 01:14:59,391
...under the 4th and 5th...

590
01:14:59,652 --> 01:15:02,439
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

591
01:15:02,697 --> 01:15:05,235
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

592
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:08,576
She's raped and left in a hole to die!
Who speaks for her?

593
01:15:08,827 --> 01:15:10,370
The district attorney's office!

594
01:15:11,372 --> 01:15:13,080
If you'll let us.

595
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:18,831
I have a wife and 3 kids. I don't want
him on the streets any more than you do.

596
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:20,915
He won't be out there long.

597
01:15:21,174 --> 01:15:23,332
What is that supposed to mean?

598
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:26,803
Sooner or later he will stub his toe
and I'll be there.

599
01:15:27,013 --> 01:15:29,719
This office won't stand
for any harassment!

600
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:34,639
You're crazy if you think you've heard
the last of him. He will kill again.

601
01:15:35,022 --> 01:15:36,515
How do you know?

602
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:39,560
Because he likes it.

603
01:18:07,094 --> 01:18:08,838
You sure you weren't tailed?

604
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:10,587
Yeah.

605
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,532
You really want $200 worth.

606
01:18:38,628 --> 01:18:40,537
Every penny of it.

607
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:56,310
Might as well be comfortable.

608
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,646
Go on, sit.

609
01:19:06,364 --> 01:19:07,857
Relax.

610
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:11,032
Take it easy.

611
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,736
It's going to be all right.

612
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,322
You sure you want the rest of it?

613
01:19:58,084 --> 01:19:59,827
Every penny's worth!

614
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:04,829
You black son of a bitch!

615
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:28,985
This one's on the house.

616
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,166
That's got to be him.

617
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,887
Are you claiming that the
San Francisco Police did this to you?

618
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:54,048
I swear it. As God is my judge.

619
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,431
Why are they harassing you?

620
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,678
They tried to frame me with the murder.

621
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:01,809
And now they're trying to murder me.
And look at me!

622
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:06,230
I'm innocent until proven guilty
and look at what they did to me.

623
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,696
Everywhere I go cops follow me.
And just look at me!

624
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:13,237
Just a minute, nurse.
Let me ask him one more question.

625
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,492
Did you see who did this to you?

626
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:16,909
Can you identify him?

627
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:21,785
<i>His name is Callahan. He's a big cop.
Works Homicide. Callahan.</i>

628
01:21:24,256 --> 01:21:27,375
Now, that's the rerun
from the 4 o'clock news.

629
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,588
<i>Since then he's given
a statement to The Chronicle.</i>

630
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:34,381
He claims you've been following him.
And beat him up.

631
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,142
What about it, Harry?

632
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:40,552
- You want my star?
- I want an answer.

633
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,557
Have you been following him?

634
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,692
Yeah, I've been following him
on my own time.

635
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:50,354
- Anybody can tell I didn't do that.
- How?

636
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:53,825
Because he looks
too damn good, that's how!

637
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:57,289
Before I let you go,
let's get one thing straight.

638
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:00,245
I don't want any more surveillance!

639
01:22:01,211 --> 01:22:02,953
Neither does he.

640
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:06,001
What does that mean?

641
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,425
Good night, sir.

642
01:22:13,306 --> 01:22:15,049
Go ahead. Try them.

643
01:22:15,599 --> 01:22:19,183
- Guy makes them where I always eat.
- Thank you.

644
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:22,107
I talked to Bressler
about being on with me.

645
01:22:23,107 --> 01:22:25,776
So you know you got a spot
when you get out.

646
01:22:26,444 --> 01:22:29,528
I don't know
if I am coming back, Harry.

647
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:35,821
Doing a lot of thinking
about it and...

648
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:41,116
I have a teaching credential.
And I figure...

649
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:43,828
...what for? You know?

650
01:22:47,216 --> 01:22:50,133
- Time for therapy.
- You hang in there now.

651
01:22:56,142 --> 01:22:58,300
See you tomorrow. Same time?

652
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,919
- It's my fault, you know.
- What?

653
01:23:24,545 --> 01:23:26,917
His leaving.
I thought I could take it.

654
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:28,667
No class.

655
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:31,632
- Don't ever say that.
- What?

656
01:23:31,886 --> 01:23:33,761
Don't ever low-rate yourself.

657
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:38,012
What I meant was, whatever it takes
to be a cop's wife...

658
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:40,308
...I'm just not sure I'm making it.

659
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:43,100
He really tries,
and all these bastards...

660
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:45,682
..."pig" this and "pig" that.

661
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:50,685
But maybe it's when I watch him
walk out that door at night.

662
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:52,192
And I think...

663
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:55,822
...what if it's the last time
I see him?

664
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:58,572
Am I the only one?

665
01:23:58,873 --> 01:24:00,829
Doesn't it drive your wife crazy?

666
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:02,239
No.

667
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,535
You mean she got used to it?

668
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:07,838
No, she never did, really.

669
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,371
What, then?

670
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:11,635
She's dead.

671
01:24:12,386 --> 01:24:14,130
Please, forgive me.

672
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:18,009
She was driving home
and a drunk crossed the center line.

673
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:19,727
No reason for it, really.

674
01:24:20,603 --> 01:24:22,845
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

675
01:24:23,605 --> 01:24:25,266
I want you to tell Chico...

676
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:28,357
...that I understand him quitting.

677
01:24:28,612 --> 01:24:31,779
I think he's right.
This is no life for you two.

678
01:24:32,407 --> 01:24:35,573
- Why do you stay in it, then?
- I don't know.

679
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:38,614
I really don't.

680
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:18,152
Let me have a fifth of Seagram's.
Please.

681
01:25:19,622 --> 01:25:21,532
What the hell happened to you?

682
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,748
My wife's brother.

683
01:25:24,001 --> 01:25:25,116
I hit her...

684
01:25:25,377 --> 01:25:27,038
...so he hit me.

685
01:25:27,297 --> 01:25:28,791
Several times.

686
01:25:30,341 --> 01:25:31,800
$5.69.

687
01:25:33,804 --> 01:25:36,887
You're the guy
that's been robbed all these times.

688
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:39,596
14 times the last 3 years.

689
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:42,853
Last 2 times, I sent them
out of here on platters.

690
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:45,679
I'm getting to be a pretty good shot.

691
01:25:46,816 --> 01:25:50,648
And I always keep it right here.
Right where it's handy.

692
01:25:50,863 --> 01:25:53,354
Please, I scare easy.

693
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:59,323
Dirty son of a bitch! You pilferer!

694
01:26:35,825 --> 01:26:36,987
Goodbye.

695
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:40,078
See you tomorrow.

696
01:26:50,006 --> 01:26:52,711
Everybody out who gets out here?

697
01:26:53,052 --> 01:26:54,629
School bus inspector.

698
01:26:54,845 --> 01:26:57,466
One minute.
I'm not allowed to have anybody...

699
01:26:57,681 --> 01:26:59,305
I'm authorizing it, so go.

700
01:26:59,599 --> 01:27:01,391
What are you doing?
I don't know you.

701
01:27:01,643 --> 01:27:05,938
Hear me, old hag. Drive or I'll
decorate this bus with your brains.

702
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:11,643
- Where?
- Just get started. I'll tell you where.

703
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:17,951
Let's have some fun now.

704
01:27:18,327 --> 01:27:19,738
Who knows a song?

705
01:27:19,913 --> 01:27:22,996
Everybody knows a song. You?
You must know a beautiful one.

706
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:25,284
Come on, sing for us.

707
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:12,563
- Millie, this is Inspector Callahan.
- The Mayor is waiting for you.

708
01:29:16,866 --> 01:29:19,439
- What's up?
- Another note from our boy.

709
01:29:19,702 --> 01:29:23,830
- Who's he grabbed now?
- That's the trouble, we don't know yet.

710
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,788
The jet must be fueled and
ready to go in half an hour.

711
01:29:29,338 --> 01:29:32,337
Skeleton crew.
They must be volunteers.

712
01:29:32,923 --> 01:29:34,798
Tell them the man is dangerous.

713
01:29:35,051 --> 01:29:38,836
I'll read you this note which
was delivered at 8:00 this morning.

714
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:40,592
"To the City of San Francisco.

715
01:29:40,808 --> 01:29:43,345
You double-crossed me
for the last time.

716
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:48,310
I'm warning you to have my $200,000
in a jet airplane ready and waiting.

717
01:29:49,065 --> 01:29:52,814
I'll call the Mayor's office at 1:00
and tell you about the hostages...

718
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:55,643
...who I will be happy to kill
if you don't do...

719
01:29:55,905 --> 01:29:58,278
...exactly what I say. Scorpio."

720
01:30:01,245 --> 01:30:03,321
Better have somebody standing by!

721
01:30:03,581 --> 01:30:05,490
I don't think it's a false alarm.

722
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:07,949
<i>There's a call for you on line 2.</i>

723
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:10,624
<i>I think it's the one
you've been waiting for.</i>

724
01:30:17,262 --> 01:30:20,131
<i>- It's the Mayor.
- I got 7 kids from Park Street School.</i>

725
01:30:22,642 --> 01:30:23,840
I got the bus and...

726
01:30:24,101 --> 01:30:27,601
Come on, honey, now back in the bus.
That's a good girl.

727
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,683
I got the bus driver.
Here she is.

728
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:31,477
Just tell him.

729
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:33,402
Not my fault, he had a gun...

730
01:30:33,611 --> 01:30:34,525
Just your name!

731
01:30:38,575 --> 01:30:40,034
<i>This is Marcella Platt.</i>

732
01:30:41,911 --> 01:30:44,449
<i>You can check if you want.
But I don 't see any point.</i>

733
01:30:44,706 --> 01:30:46,248
<i>I'm not bullshitting.</i>

734
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:49,578
<i>It's simple. I got the kids.
You start screwing around...</i>

735
01:30:49,794 --> 01:30:51,373
<i>... the kids start dying.</i>

736
01:30:51,589 --> 01:30:55,206
<i>- The plane ready?
- It's being fueled, and ready to go.</i>

737
01:30:55,425 --> 01:30:58,212
<i>The money will be there
by the time you get there.</i>

738
01:30:58,428 --> 01:31:01,596
<i>Listen carefully.
I will drive along nice and easy.</i>

739
01:31:01,849 --> 01:31:03,806
<i>Just me and a busload of kids.</i>

740
01:31:04,143 --> 01:31:07,345
<i>I'll turn off at Sir Francis Drake
on my way to Santa Rosa Airport.</i>

741
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:09,431
<i>I don 't want any police cars...</i>

742
01:31:09,648 --> 01:31:10,811
<i>... helicopters, whatever.</i>

743
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:15,272
If you play this game by the rules,
the kids will have a nice plane ride.

744
01:31:15,488 --> 01:31:17,279
Where are you going?

745
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:21,073
I'll tell the pilot
when I get on. No alerts.

746
01:31:22,995 --> 01:31:26,162
I guarantee you, you will not
be molested in any way.

747
01:31:26,415 --> 01:31:27,994
I give you my word of honor.

748
01:31:29,335 --> 01:31:31,244
Marcella Platt. It checks.

749
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:37,708
Willing to take the money to him?

750
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:42,258
When will you stop messing around with
this guy? He has to be stopped now!

751
01:31:42,599 --> 01:31:45,553
He's got a busload of kids
and I can't take that chance.

752
01:31:46,186 --> 01:31:49,140
I gave my word of honor
and he will not be molested!

753
01:31:49,356 --> 01:31:51,016
And that's a direct order!

754
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:56,436
You can just get yourself
another delivery boy.

755
01:33:30,168 --> 01:33:31,994
Where are we going?

756
01:33:33,004 --> 01:33:36,705
- This isn't the right way!
- We're going to the ice cream factory.

757
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:38,834
Anyone doesn't want to, can get off.

758
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:41,673
I want to go home to my mother.

759
01:33:41,929 --> 01:33:43,092
Go home to your what?

760
01:33:44,015 --> 01:33:45,724
Now, sing! Sing again!

761
01:33:47,811 --> 01:33:49,602
What's the matter?
Don't you sing?

762
01:33:51,397 --> 01:33:53,520
Are you sick?
What is it?

763
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:56,932
Sing or your mothers will die!

764
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:59,901
I'll kill your mothers!
And the rest of you!

765
01:34:07,247 --> 01:34:09,156
Get in the right-hand lane.

766
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:11,789
Not right to treat children that way.

767
01:34:12,044 --> 01:34:14,500
- You'll hurt them.
- Just drive the goddamn bus!

768
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:16,830
And get in the right-hand lane!

769
01:34:23,723 --> 01:34:25,846
I want my mother.

770
01:34:34,192 --> 01:34:35,852
The sign, Sir Drake Blvd.

771
01:34:36,069 --> 01:34:37,148
Make a right there.

772
01:34:37,987 --> 01:34:41,237
There's a sign to Sir Drake Boulevard!

773
01:34:41,908 --> 01:34:43,782
Not this one.

774
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:45,786
I want my mother.

775
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,111
Shut up!

776
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,743
Just get to the right!

777
01:35:06,684 --> 01:35:08,261
Jesus!

778
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,933
What the hell is he doing up there?

779
01:35:23,576 --> 01:35:26,660
What the hell are you doing?
Pass the V.W., will you?

780
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,736
Drop the gun, creep!

781
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,656
I'll blow his brains out.

782
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,836
Drop the fucking gun!

783
01:39:45,303 --> 01:39:47,011
I know what you're thinking.

784
01:39:48,264 --> 01:39:51,763
You're thinking,
did he fire 6 shots, or only 5?

785
01:39:52,727 --> 01:39:56,061
To tell you the truth, I forgot
myself, in all this excitement.

786
01:39:57,066 --> 01:40:00,814
But being this is a.44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world...

787
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:03,733
...and will blow your head
clean off...

788
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:05,940
...you've got to ask yourself:

789
01:40:07,326 --> 01:40:09,034
"Do I feel lucky?"

790
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,158
Well, do you, punk?
