[ Man Narrating ] All my life,

2
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,658
I've lived and worked in the big city,

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,159
which, now that I think of it,

4
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,658
is kind of a problem,

5
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,399
since I always feel

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,138
uncomfortable around crowds.

7
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,419
I mean it.

8
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,698
I have this fear of enclosed spaces.

feel trapped all the time.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,299
You know, I always tell myself there's

gotta be something better out there.

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,179
But maybe I--

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,378
maybe I think too much.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,699
I-I-I think everything

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,018
must go back to the fact...

17
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,939
that I had a very anxious childhood.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,719
You know, my mother

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,498

I-I was not cut out to be a worker,

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,618
I'll tell you right now.

35
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,799
I-I-I feel

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,178
is not as understanding as I am.

176
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,480
Dismissed.

177
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,919
Four more days, Cutter.

178
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,698
Four more days.

179
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,379
Then we can bid final farewell

180
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,058
to their kind of incompetence.

181
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,499
Yes, sir.

182
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,659
A fresh start.

183
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,199
- Imagine it!

184
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,738
- A strong colony, sir.

185
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,659
A colony we can be proud of.

186
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,019
Yes, but we're not there yet.

187
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,359
Cutter, we just got word that

188
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,698
a termite army has mobilized against us.

189
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,699
Against us?

190
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,139
We'll have to send troops

191
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,578
deep into hostile territory...

192
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,179
to attack their colony.

193
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,579
Attack a termite colony, sir?

194
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,599
- That's suicide.

195
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,618
- Exactly.

196
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,559
- Do you have the list I asked for?

197
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,498
- Yes, General.

198
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,750
These are the units

199
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:27,000
loyal to the queen.

200
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,079
Hm. Then they're

201
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,978
the ones we'll be sending.

202
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,179
It's a shame.

203
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,378
There's some fine officers here.

204
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,459
Don't we need the queen's

205
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,538
approval to declare war?

206
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,960
Our very next stop, Cutter.

207
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,239
General, we've been at peace

208
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,898
with that colony for years.

209
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,159
- Why would they attack us?

210
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,418
- They want our land.

211
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,819
They're desperate

212
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,218
for more foraging territory.

213
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,399
Perhaps they think

214
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,578
we've grown soft or weak.

215
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,899
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,

216
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,218
negotiate a new treaty?

217
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,979
- We don't need to send soldiers.

218
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,738
- Believe me.

219
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,110
Every ant in this colony

220
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,480
is so precious to me.

221
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,679
- [ Grunts ]

222
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,138
- That's why we must strike now.

223
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,219
We have the element of surprise.

224
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,659
If the termite shock troops

225
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,098
enter our colony, well--

226
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,310
Yes, General,

227
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:16,520
I know what they can do to us.

228
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,659
- Very well.

229
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,138
- You've made a wise decision.

230
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,150
In fact, you've insured

231
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,160
the future of this colony.

232
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,440
Hello, General.

233
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,459
Princess Bala.

234
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,098
What a nice surprise.

235
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,199
You look lovelier

236
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,298
each time I see you.

237
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,359
Thanks. I hope you're not

238
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,418
just here on business.

239
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,899
Oh, of course-- [ Chuckles ]

240
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,378
of course not.

241
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,639
Because, um,

242
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,898
it might be nice...

243
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,299
if we had a conversation once

244
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,698
before we get married.

245
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,619
You're absolutely right.

246
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,019
Cutter, schedule some private time

247
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,418
for me and Princess Bala.

248
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,319
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,218
right now for a personal moment.

250
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,399
We're a few seconds

251
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,578
ahead of schedule.

252
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,619
Excellent.

253
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,658
Princess.

254
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,139
Well, a few seconds isn't much,

255
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,659
but I guess if it's quality time--

256
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,299
So, how was your day?

257
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,699
- Anything interesting happen?

258
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,098
- We declared war.

259
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,539
Declared war?

260
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,539
Boy, talk about a rough day.

261
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,619
Sir, I hate to interrupt,

262
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,698
but time stands still for no ant.

263
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,040
Princess.

264
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,799
Mom, could you remind me,

265
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,178
why am I marrying this guy?

266
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,639
Bala, do we have to argue

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,098
about this again?

268
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,979
We don't seem to have anything

269
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,858
in common. The guy's a stiff.

270
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,959
Yes, darling.

271
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,058
I know the general may be...

272
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,079
a little gruff

273
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,098
and somewhat overbearing at times,

274
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,299
but I know that he cares about you.

275
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,739
He's just not particularly good

276
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,178
at showing it.

277
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,099
But you should've seen how persistently

278
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,018
he asked for your hand in marriage.

279
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,219
But why me?

280
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,419
Because you're the one

281
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,618
who has to continue my work.

282
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,539
It's your place, dear.

283
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,099
- What if I don't like my place?

284
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,658
- Everyone has their place, Bala--

285
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,019
you, the soldiers, the workers.

286
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,379
Now, it's not all that bad

287
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,738
being princess, is it?

288
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,259
Would you prefer to be

289
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,778
carting around dirt all day?

290
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,840
Mother, don't be so dramatic.

291
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,730
At least, they seem to have

292
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,400
some fun every now and then.

293
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,979
- [ Man ] Two aphid beers.

294
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,138
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

295
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,679
You soldiers get all the glory,

296
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,218
plus you get to go out in the world.

297
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,479
You meet interesting insects,

298
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,738
you get to kill them.

299
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,419
Yeah. But you get to spend

300
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,098
all day with those...

301
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,019
beautiful worker girls.

302
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,099
Weaver, they're career girls.

303
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,178
They're obsessed with digging.

304
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,159
[ Sighs ] I don't think I'm ever

305
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,138
gonna meet the right girl for me.

306
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,959
Who said a girl for you?

307
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,778
I was talking about a girl for me.

308
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,799
[ Chuckles ]

309
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,818
Don't you want your aphid beer?

310
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,779
Call me crazy, but--

311
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,738
[ Clears Throat ]

312
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,059
I have a thing about drinking from

313
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,378
the anus of another creature. Okay?

314
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,760
Suit yourself.

315
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,179
Ahhh.

316
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,418
Me, I'm cutting loose.

317
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,379
We got royal inspection coming up.

318
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,699
Inspection, meaning you're gonna

319
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,018
stand around like an idiot...

320
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,139
while a bunch of blue bloods

321
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,258
smirk at you.

322
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,219
I don't know how

323
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,178
you put up with it, Weaver.

324
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,579
Z, I've known you

325
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,978
for a long time. Right?

326
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,119
Definitely.

327
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,258
You were born two seconds after me.

328
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,759
Yeah. And ever since we were little,

329
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,258
I've been listening to you complain.

330
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,219
What are you bitching about?

331
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,419
In case you haven't noticed,

332
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,618
we ants are running the show.

333
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,579
We're the lords of the Earth.

334
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,839
Hey. Don't talk to me

335
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,098
about earth, okay?

336
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,079
'Cause I just spent all day
