00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,080
[ Man Narrating ] All my life,
I've lived and worked in the big city,

2
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,080
which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,080
I mean it.
I have this fear of enclosed spaces.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,040
I-I-I-- Everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,440
You know, I always tell myself there's
gotta be something better out there.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,800
But maybe I--
maybe I think too much.

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,440
I-I-I think everything
must go back to the fact...

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
that I had a very anxious childhood.

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,880
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,280
When you're the middle child
in a family of 5 million,

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
you don't get any attention.

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,160
I mean,
how is it possible?

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,080
And-And I've always had these
abandonment issues which plague me.

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,000
My father was-was basically a drone,
like I've said.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,200
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,160
And my job, don't get me started on,
because it really annoys me.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,040
I-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,400
I-I-I feel
physically inadequate.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift...

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,960
more than 10 times my own body weight.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,080
And, when you get down to it, handling
dirt is, you know-- [ Shudders ]

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,440
is not my idea
of a rewarding career.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,680
It's this whole gung ho,
super organism thing...

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,200
that-- that, you know, I can't get.

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,640
I try, but I don't get it.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,080
I mean-- What is it? I'm supposed
to do everything for the colony.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,880
And-And what about my needs?
What about me?

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,840
I've gotta believe there's someplace
out there that's better than this.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,680
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,600
[ Sighs ]

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,160
The whole system makes me feel...

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,200
[ Exhales ]
insignificant.

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
Excellent.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
- You've made a real breakthrough.
- I have?

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,560
Yes, Z.
You are insignificant.

37
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,480
I am?

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,960
## [ Whistling ]

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
[ Man ]
Ground floor.

[ Babies Crying Softly ]

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,640
- [ Cries ]
- Uh, worker.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
Soldier.

43
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Ooh.
[ Giggles ]

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,600
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
[ Cries ]

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,200
[ Man ]
Let's try it again.

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,040
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,000
Follow through.

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,520
[ Grunts ]

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay. I've got to keep
a positive attitude.

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,440
A good attitude, even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,920
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,840
- [ Coughs ]
- [ Woman ] Oh, sorry, Z.

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,560
- [ Chuckles ] I didn't see ya.
- Great, Azteca.

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
It's working already.
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Laughs ]

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Now, you're getting it.

58
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,760
After all, it's not about you.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
It's about us-- the team.

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
It's about... this.

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
Uh, a giant hole
in the ground?

62
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,200
- Okay, people. Are we feeling good?
- [ All ] Yeah.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,240
- Yeah.
- Great.

64
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
- You got it.
- Swell.

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
- You got it.
- [ Man ] All right. Swing time.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,480
- Let's get physical.
- I love this job.

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Now, remember, Azteca,
"Be the ball."

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,040
That's the main thing.
Now, remember that.

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,200
You know, gotta be
one with the ball.

71
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Would you cut it out already?

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,320
Jeez. I love my work.
And you, well--

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
You think too much.

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
Come on, Z. Help us build
a bigger, better colony.

75
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,480
And, for crying out loud,
try to be happy about it.

76
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,400
Sure, you know.
I mean, why-why--

77
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,320
How could I possibly be unhappy being
a piece of construction equipment?

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,000
- Okay, workers, remember.
- Here it comes.

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,880
- Be the ball.
- Oh!

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,400
[ Foreman ]
Let the energy flow through you.

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
Grin and bear it. This is--
This is for the colony. Oh.

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
- [ All Yelling ]
- Ow. This is--

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,600
This is just a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

84
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,680
- Hang on. Here we go.
- Faster. Harder.

85
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,200
Did I happen to mention
that heights make me nauseous?

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
No.

87
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,640
- This is a ball.
- Hey.

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
- [ Yelling, Indistinct ]
- [ Gagging ]

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,920
- [ Azteca ] Oh, Z.
- Yes. Yes. I understand.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,880
I dropped the ball.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,920
[ Man ]
Workers. They're weak.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,320
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

93
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,080
General, I know there's
been a glitch or two.

94
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,960
But everybody is working
full tilt as it is, and--

95
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,200
You can't help it,
it's your nature.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,160
But in spite of your limitations,

97
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,040
you are going to finish
this tunnel on schedule.

98
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
Come hell or high water.

99
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Anyone who falls behind is going to have
to explain themselves to Colonel Cutter.

100
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,640
And let me assure you, the colonel
is not as understanding as I am.

101
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,480
Dismissed.

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,160
Four more days, Cutter.
Four more days.

103
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,520
Then we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

104
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,960
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,080
A fresh start.

106
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
A colony we can be proud of.

108
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
Yes, but we're not there yet.

109
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,120
Cutter, we just got word that
a termite army has mobilized against us.

110
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,120
Against us?

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,000
We'll have to send troops
deep into hostile territory...

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,640
to attack their colony.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Attack a termite colony, sir?

114
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,040
- That's suicide.
- Exactly.

115
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,960
- Do you have the list I asked for?
- Yes, General.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
These are the units
loyal to the queen.

117
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,400
Hm. Then they're
the ones we'll be sending.

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,840
It's a shame.
There's some fine officers here.

119
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't we need the queen's
approval to declare war?

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,960
Our very next stop, Cutter.

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,320
General, we've been at peace
with that colony for years.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,840
- Why would they attack us?
- They want our land.

123
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,680
They're desperate
for more foraging territory.

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,000
Perhaps they think
we've grown soft or weak.

125
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,640
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
- We don't need to send soldiers.
- Believe me.

127
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,480
Every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

128
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,600
- [ Grunts ]
- That's why we must strike now.

129
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,680
We have the element of surprise.

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,560
If the termite shock troops
enter our colony, well--

131
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,520
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,560
- Very well.
- You've made a wise decision.

133
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,160
In fact, you've insured
the future of this colony.

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
Hello, General.

135
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,560
Princess Bala.
What a nice surprise.

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,760
You look lovelier
each time I see you.

137
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,840
Thanks. I hope you're not
just here on business.

138
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,840
Oh, of course-- [ Chuckles ]
of course not.

139
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,360
Because, um,
it might be nice...

140
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,120
if we had a conversation once
before we get married.

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
You're absolutely right.

142
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,840
Cutter, schedule some private time
for me and Princess Bala.

143
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,640
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time
right now for a personal moment.

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
We're a few seconds
ahead of schedule.

145
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,040
Excellent.
Princess.

146
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Well, a few seconds isn't much,

147
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,040
but I guess if it's quality time--

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
So, how was your day?

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,560
- Anything interesting happen?
- We declared war.

150
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,960
Declared war?

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,920
Boy, talk about a rough day.

152
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,120
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Princess.

154
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,600
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

155
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,520
Bala, do we have to argue

We don't seem to have anything
in common. The guy's a stiff.

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Yes, darling.
I know the general may be...

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,520
a little gruff
and somewhat overbearing at times,

at showing it.

In case you haven't noticed,
we ants are running the show.

We're the lords of the Earth.

'Cause I just spent all day

You can be your own ant there.

- [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. Fascinating.

We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

This is so... gritty.

Ten minutes and we're out of here.
Right? This place is off limits.

- Absolutely.

Oh, the palace, huh?
I bet those royals really live it up.

Well, actually, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of making it up.

Really?

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,200
Why does everybody
have to dance the same way?

That's completely boring.
It's-- It's monotonous.

Okay. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

313
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,640
Would I meet
some worker girls?

Are you kidding?
They always go after the new guy.

It's like a sport for them.

of an individual ant doesn't matter.

Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

765
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,120
We have to help them.

766
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,280
If you'll just wait right here,
we'll fetch you a little something.

Oh, please, Muffy.
Not another crusade.

768
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,760
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

Mm. You have such a big heart.

That's why you're

- You know...
- [ Muffy ] Oh!

I guess I had
imagined Insectopia--

- Z?
- Yes?

I ain't telling you nothing.

Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

We already have a queen.

As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

[ Chuckles ]
He's not important.

Now, soldier,

we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

Uhh! I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

As a matter of fact... it does.

- Sir?
- I'll brief you on the coordinates.

You're gonna bring

And as for Z... kill him.

But you said he didn't matter.

It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

Gentlemen, now you can see...

how dangerous individualism can be.

00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,720
It makes us... vulnerable.

- Stop right now! Let go of me!

Stop, you--
Oh, no.

[ Muttering ]
What am I gonna do?

920
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,040
All right, look.
Let's be rational about this.

You know, Bala and I,

Ohh!

It's the least I can do.

928

Besides, it's what my waddly-kiddles
would want.

[ Sniffling, Sobbing ]

Uh, look, [ Clears Throat ]
how about a cup of joe first?

- Well, old boy... saddle up.

a puddle of coffee over there.

Ah, Princess.

- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me.

General, what exactly
is going on here?

- I demand an explanation.
- I'll explain everything afterwards.

- Is the southeast entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

Not afterwards. Now.

I don't like the way you think and I
don't like the way you run this colony.

And I don't like you.
The wedding is off.

- Things are going to change around here.
- You're right, Princess.

Things are going to change.
Why don't we make her more comfortable?

- [ Gasps ]
- She'll be here for a while.

What do you think you're doing?
My mother will have your head.

I doubt that. [ Chuckles ]
Ah, you've got a fighter spirit, Bala.

949
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,680
And that's just what we need
to start our new colony.

01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,240
We will rinse away
all the filth from our gutters.

We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

You're crazy.

I believe history
will see things differently.

Look at what these workers have done.

Uh-oh.

Run! Keep going!

Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

1071
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,400
We need to calmly
head toward the exits.

- Run for your lives! It's gonna flood!
- No. Don't panic.

- All the exits are blocked!
- We're trapped!

- What are we going to do?
- There's nothing we can do!

Yes, there is.
Weaver, give me a leg up.

Listen, we gotta help each other
get outta here before we all drown.

- [ Man ] How?
- By making a ladder.

1084

A ladder!

1085

Hey, if we built this,
we can do anything.

- Okay, let's move it!
- I'm on it. All of you, gather round.

- Excuse me, Your Majesty.
- [ Grunting ]

Don't worry. I know almost
exactly what I'm doing.

I'll see you at the top.

in the evolution
of a perfect colony...

1096
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,160
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1097
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Now is that time.

1098

Below us right now,

- You two better get up there.

Get going.

Our princess is secured,

We can all stand proud.

It is time for a new beginning.

- [ Soldiers Gasp ]
- What the hell is that?

1113
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,720
I think that's
the weak element, sir.

- Give me-- Give me a hand!
- Z! You?

Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony.

Something I should've done
a long time ago.

This is for the good
of the colony, sir.

So, what else can I tell you?

We rebuilt the colony.
It's even better than before.
