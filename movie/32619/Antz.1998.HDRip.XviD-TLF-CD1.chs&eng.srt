5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,238
我这辈子都住在大城市

6
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:34,247
老实说，这是个问题

7
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:35,049
which, now that I think of it, is kind of a problem,

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,652
since I always feel uncomfortable around crowds.
我一直不喜欢我住的地方

9
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,358
I mean it. I have this fear of enclosed spaces.
我很害怕封闭的空间

10
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:44,426
l-l-l... Everything makes me feel trapped all the time.
我...我...我老觉得被困住

11
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:47,940
You know, I always tell myself there's gotta be something better out there.
我一直告诉自己

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,268
一定有更好的地方

13
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:50,408
But maybe l... maybe I think too much.
但我还得面对现实

14
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:53,174
I-I-I think everything must go back to the fact...

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,182
that I had a very anxious childhood.
我想是因为我的童年不愉快

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,879
You know, my mother never had time for me.
你知道我母亲没时间陪我

17
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:02,413
When you're the middle child in a family of 5 million,
我是中间的小孩

18
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,290
有五百万个兄弟姐妹

19
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,460
you don't get any attention.
当然得不到宠爱

20
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:06,462
I mean, how is it possible?
怎么可能呢?

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,557
And-And I've always had these abandonment issues which plague me.
我老是觉得被父母遗弃

22
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,603
My father was-was basically a drone, like I've said.
我父亲是只雄蚁

23
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:16,936
And, you know, the guy flew away when I was just a larva.
我还是小蛹时他就飞走了

24
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,141
And my job, don't get me started on, because it really annoys me.
至于我的工作，更别提了

25
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:23,351
因为真的很无聊

26
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,151
I-I was not cut out to be a worker, I'll tell you right now.
老实说，我不适合当蚂蚁

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,620
I-I-I feel physically inadequate.
我的体力不够

28
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,886
My whole life, I've never been able to lift...
我从来都没办法

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,394
more than 10 times my own body weight.
搬比我重十倍的东西

30
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:38,695
And, when you get down to it, handling dirt is, you know... [Shudders]
老实说，玩泥巴

31
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:42,237
is not my idea of a rewarding career.
不能算是有成就感的事业

32
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:45,638
It's this whole gung ho, superorganism thing...
这种井井有条的组织

33
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,234
that... that, you know, I can't get.
我就是不习惯

34
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:50,803
I try, but I don't get it.
我试过，我就是不懂

35
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:54,374
I mean... What is it? I'm supposed to do everything for the colony.
我该为蚁国牺牲一切吗?

36
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:57,319
And-And what about my needs? What about me?
我的需要呢？我怎么办?

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,382
I've gotta believe there's someplace out there that's better than this.
我得相信外面有更好的世界

38
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,361
Otherwise, I would just curl up in a larval position and weep.
否则我干脆卷成一团哭死算了

39
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,364
[Sighs]
这整个制度都让我觉得...

40
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:08,026
The whole system makes me feel...

41
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:11,196
[Exhales] insignificant.
非常渺小

42
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,001
Excellent.
太好了，你终于有突破

43
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:15,338
- You've made a real breakthrough. - I have?
是吗?

44
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:17,879
Yes, Z. You are insignificant.
没错，

45
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,882
I am?
你的确很渺小

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,499
真的吗?

47

52
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,460
Soldier.
兵蚁

53
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:08,471
Ooh. [Giggles]

00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,803
- Uh-oh. - Worker.

[Man] Let's try it again.
大家再试一次

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,857
Firm grip. Swing hard. Back straight. Concentrate.
抓紧，用力，背挺直

58
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,646
专心一点，打起精神

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,894
Follow through.

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,354
[Grunts]

61
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,353
Okay. I've got to keep a positive attitude.
好吧，我得保持乐观

62
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:59,660
A good attitude, even though I'm utterly insignificant.
看开点，虽然我很渺小

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,331
I'm-I'm insignificant, um, but with attitude.
我很渺小，可是很有个性

64
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,339
- [Coughs] - [Woman] 0h, sorry, Z.
抱歉，Z

65
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:09,171
- [Chuckles] I didn't see ya. - Great, Azteca.
我没看到你

66
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:11,974
It's working already. I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.
太好了，小爱，有用了

67
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:13,751
我太渺小，简直不存在

68
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,981
- [Grunts] - [Laughs]

69
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,185
Now, you're getting it.
你终于搞懂了

70
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:20,848
After all, it's not about you.
毕竟...

71
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,750
...你并不重要

72
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,655
It's about us... the team.
我们才重要

73
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,791
团队精神

74
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:28,027
It's about... this.
一切都是为了...这个

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,091
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?
地底下的大洞?

76
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,866
- Okay, people. Are we feeling good? - [All] Yeah.
大伙，你们好吗?

77
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:33,802
好

78
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,999
- Yeah. - Great.
很好

79
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:41,207
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829, you guys are on wrecking ball.
太好了

80
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,812
R―1734到Z―7829

81
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,812
你们当大球

82
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,215
- You got it. - Swell.
没问题

83
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,479
- You got it. - [Man] All right. Swing time.
棒呆了

84
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:45,823
没问题

85
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,714
- Let's get physical. - I love this job.
记住，想象你是球

86
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,452
Now, remember, Azteca, "Be the ball."

87
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:52,460
That's the main thing. Now, remember that.
记住这个重点

88
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,723
You know, gotta be one with the ball.
和球合而为一

89
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:56,766
Would you cut it out already?
别闹了

90
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,098
Jeez. I love my work. And you, well...
我很爱我的工作，你...

91
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,605
You think too much.
你想太多了

92
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:06,939
Come on, Z. Help us build a bigger, better colony.
帮我们建设更好更大的蚁国

93
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,640
And, for cryin' out loud, try to be happy about it.
拜托你开心点

94
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:11,649
Sure, you know. I mean, why-why...
是啊

95
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:13,827
我自愿撞墙，当然开心了

96
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,710
How could I possibly be unhappy being a piece of construction equipment?

97
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,484
- Okay, workers, remember. - Here it comes.
工蚁们，记住

98
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,827
来了

99
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:20,493
- Be the ball. - 0h!
和球合而为一

[Foreman] Let the energy flow through you.
释放你们的能量

101
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:29,425
Grin and bear it. This is... This is for the colony. 0h.
咬紧牙关，这是为了国家

102
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,602
- [All Yelling] - 0w. This is...

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,888
这样肯定会吃上官司

104
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,837
This is just a lawsuit waiting to happen.
抓紧，开始了

105
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:39,109
- Hang on. Here we go. - Faster. Harder.
开始摆荡

106
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:41,708
Did I happen to mention that heights make me nauseous?
我有没有提过我有惧高症

107
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:39,899
没有

108
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,959
更好玩

109
00:05:41,786 --> 00:05:42,810
No.

110
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,321
- This is a ball. - Hey.

111
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,951
- [Yelling, Indistinct] - [Gagging]

112
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:59,165
- [Azteca] Oh, Z. - Yes. Yes. I understand.
Z

113
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:59,981
我知道，我搞砸了

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,332
I dropped the ball.

115
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:06,475
[Man] Workers. They're weak.
工蚁，他们太软弱了

116
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:10,018
They lack discipline. They lack commitment.
缺乏纪律，没有决心

117
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,953
General, I know there's been a glitch or two.
将军：我知道出了点小差错

118
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:16,925
But everybody is working full tilt as it is, and...
不过大家都尽了全力

119
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:21,387
You can't help it, it's your nature.
没办法，工蚁就是无能

120
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:23,400
But in spite of your limitations,
这是你们的天性

121
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,403
you are going to finish this tunnel on schedule.
不过你要按时完成隧道

122
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,406
Come hell or high water.
不管发生什么事

123
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:32,570
Anyone who falls behind is going to have to explain themselves to Colonel Cutter.
进度落后就得向卡特上校交代

124
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:36,075
卡特上校可没我这么好说话

125
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:37,447
And let me assure you, the colonel is not as understanding as I am.

126
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:39,417
Dismissed.
解散

127
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:45,319
Four more days, Cutter. Four more days.
还剩四天，卡特

128
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,830
Then we can bid final farewell to their kind of incompetence.
就能永远摆脱这一群蠢蛋

129
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,332
Yes, sir.
是，长官

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,561
A fresh start.
从新开始

131
00:06:52,636 --> 00:06:55,764
- Imagine it! - A strong colony, sir.
想想看

132
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,126
一个强大的国家

133
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,774
A colony we can be proud of.
我们引以为傲的国家

134
00:06:57,842 --> 00:07:00,242
Yes, but we're not there yet.
不过还没成功

135
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:05,113
Cutter, we just got word that a termite army has mobilized against us.
卡特

136
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:05,148
根据情报，白蚁要攻打我们

137
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,172
Against us?
攻打我们?

138
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,153
We'll have to send troops deep into hostile territory...
我们得派军队攻打白蚁巢穴

139
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,847
to attack their colony.
攻打白蚁?这简直是自杀

140
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,391
Attack a termite colony, sir?

141
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,451
- That's suicide. - Exactly.
正是，我要的名单呢?

142
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:19,555
- Do you have the list I asked for? - Yes, General.

143
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:20,199
在这儿，将军

144
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:23,764
These are the units loyal to the queen.
这些是忠于蚁后的军队

145
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:28,375
Hm. Then they're the ones we'll be sending.
那就派他们出战

146
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:30,912
It's a shame. There's some fine officers here.
可惜，他们是优秀军人

147
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,247
Don't we need the queen's approval to declare war?
只有蚁后才能宣战

148
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,288
0ur very next stop, Cutter.
我正要去找她

149
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:42,891
General, we've been at peace with that colony for years.
将军，我们和白蚁相安无事

150
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,520
- Why would they attack us? - They want our land.
他们为何要开战?

151
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,498
They're desperate for more foraging territory.
为了我们的土地

152
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,272
他们想扩大领土

153
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,934
Perhaps they think we've grown soft or weak.
他们大概以为我们好欺负

154
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:55,771
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador, negotiate a new treaty?
不如派名使者拟订和平条约

155
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,438
- We don't need to send soldiers. - Believe me.
不必牺牲士兵

156
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:01,880
Every ant in this colony is so precious to me.
相信我

157
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:03,295
我爱惜每只蚂蚁的性命

158
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:06,143
- [Grunts] - That's why we must strike now.
所以才要让敌人措手不及

159
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:08,315
We have the element of surprise.

160
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,326
If the termite shock troops enter our colony, well...
要是让白蚁改进来

161
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:15,456
Yes, General, I know what they can do to us.
是的，将军

162
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:17,336
我知道他们的手段

163
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:20,738
- Very well. - You've made a wise decision.
好吧

164
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,346
这是英明的决定

165
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,503
In fact, you've insured the future of this colony.
你确保了蚁国的未来前途

166
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,913
Hello, General.
你好，将军

167
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:33,250
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.
芭拉公主，很高兴见到你

168
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,551
You look lovelier each time I see you.
你是越来越标致了

169
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:39,821
Thanks. I hope you're not just here on business.
谢谢

170
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,367
希望你不只是来谈公事

171
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,921
Oh, of course... [Chuckles] of course not.
当然...当然不是

172
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:45,558
Because, um, it might be nice...
因为我想在我们成亲之前...

173
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:50,572
if we had a conversation once before we get married.

174
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,418
...找机会跟你聊聊

175
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,575
You're absolutely right.
你说得很对

176
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:55,476
Cutter, schedule some private time for me and Princess Bala.
卡特，替我和公主挪出时间

177
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:59,449
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time right now for a personal moment.
现在你就有点私人时间

178
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,884
We're a few seconds ahead of schedule.
进度超前了几秒钟

179
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,047
Excellent. Princess.
太好了

180
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:05,440
公主

181
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:07,684
Well, a few seconds isn't much,
几秒钟不算久

182
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:12,391
but I guess if it's quality time...
我猜只要能好好聊聊

183
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:15,162
So, how was your day?
你今天好吗?

184
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,103
- Anything interesting happen? - We declared war.
发生什么趣事?

185
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,452
我们向白蚁宣战

186
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:21,665
Declared war?
宣战?

187
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,735
Boy, talk about a rough day.
真是的，好辛苦的一天

188
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:28,112
Sir, I hate to interrupt, but time stands still for no ant.
长官，恕我打岔

189
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,503
蚂蚁的时间很宝贵

190
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:28,473
公主

191
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:30,119
Princess.

192
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:40,095
Mom, could you remind me, why am I marrying this guy?
母后，拜托你提醒我

193
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:39,524
我为什么要嫁给他?

194
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:43,157
Bala, do we have to argue about this again?
芭拉，你又要跟我吵吗?

195
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:47,070
We don't seem to have anything in common. The guy's a stiff.
我们没有共同点，他好死板

196
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,371
Yes, darling. I know the general may be...
没错，我知道将军有点古板

197
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:53,573
a little gruff and somewhat overbearing at times,
有时候傲慢无礼

198
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:56,913
but I know that he cares about you.
不过他很关心你

199
00:09:57,018 --> 00:09:59,953
He's just not particularly good at showing it.
他只是不太会表达

200
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,958
But you should've seen how persistently he asked for your hand in marriage.
他可是费尽心思要娶你为妻

201
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,186
But why me?
为什么?

202
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,730
Because you're the one who has to continue my work.
因为你必须继续我的工作

203
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:09,732
It's your place, dear.
这是你的责任

204
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,067
- What if I don't like my place? - Everyone has their place, Bala...
我不喜欢这责任呢

205
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:13,597
每只蚁都有自己的责任

206
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,541
you, the soldiers, the workers.
你，兵蚁和工蚁

207
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:19,609
当公主没那么糟，对吧?

208
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:21,409
Now, it's not all that bad being princess, is it?
难道你想成天搬泥土吗?

209
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,574
Would you prefer to be carting around dirt all day?
母后，别这么夸张

210
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,243
Mother, don't be so dramatic.

211
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,081
At least, they seem to have some fun every now and then.
不过至少他们偶尔能找点乐子

212
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:39,601
- [Man] Two aphid beers. - Why'd I have to be born a worker?
两杯蚜虫啤酒

213
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:39,600
我为什么生来就是工蚁?

214
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:42,832
You soldiers get all the glory, plus you get to go out in the world.
当兵最威风，还能到处跑

215
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:45,431
You meet interesting insects, you get to kill them.
认识有趣的昆虫，杀死它们

216
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:48,945
Yeah. But you get to spend all day with those...
是啊，不过你们成天都能...

217
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:52,005
beautiful worker girls.
跟漂亮的女士工蚁在一起

218
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:56,349
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.
老魏，她们是上班女郎

219
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,622
只会成天挖泥土

220
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,483
[Sighs] I don't think I'm ever gonna meet the right girl for me.
我是碰不到梦中情人了

221
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,257
Who said a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.
我不是说你，我是说我

222
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,389
[Chuckles] Don't you want your aphid beer?
你不喝蚜虫啤酒吗?

223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,434
Call me crazy, but... [Clears Throat]
别说我怪

224
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:10,604
我不从别人的屁眼喝东西

225
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:11,199
I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. 0kay?

226
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:13,206
Suit yourself.
随你便

227
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:17,468
Ahhh. Me, I'm cuttin' loose.
我要好好轻松一下

228
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,514
We got royal inspection comin' up.
马上就要举行阅兵典礼

229
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,279
Inspection, meaning you're gonna stand around like an idiot...
阅兵典礼?

230
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:23,695
像白痴排排站让贵族嘲笑?

231
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,616
while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you.
你怎么能忍受呢?

232
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,622
I don't know how you put up with it, Weaver.
我们认识很久了，对吧?

233
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,558
Z, I've known you for a long time. Right?

234
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:31,925
Definitely. You were born two seconds after me.
当然，你比我晚生两秒钟

235
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:35,023
Yeah. And ever since we were little, I've been listenin' to you complain.
我从小就听你抱怨

236
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,091
What are you bitching about?
你有什么好抱怨的?

237
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,637
In case you haven't noticed, we ants are running the show.
咱们蚂蚁统治了整个世界

238
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,640
We're the lords of the Earth.
我们是地球的主宰

239
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,233
Hey. Don't talk to me about earth, okay?
别跟我提到地球

240
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:48,406
'Cause I just spent all day hauling it around.
我整天都在搬地上的泥土

241
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,816
[Sighs] There's just gotta be a better place.
一定有更好的地方

242
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:55,583
There is. I've been there.
当然有，我去过

243
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,785
I'm sor... I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?
抱歉，你在跟我说话?

244
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,763
There is a better place... Insectopia.
有更好的地方

245
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,849
昆虫乐国

246
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,929
Oh, really. Lunatic at 3:00.
真的吗?

247
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,849
三点钟方向

248
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:11,169
You can't understand till you go there and see it yourself.
你得去亲眼目睹才会相信

249
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,575
You can be your own ant there.
在那里自由自在

250
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,013
The streets are paved with food.
到处都是吃的

251
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,347
Nobody tellin' you what to do.
没有人管你

252
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,979
No wars. No colony.
没有战争，没有国家

253
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:27,483
- I shoulda never left. - [Chuckles] 0h, yeah. Fascinating.
我不该离开的

254
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:26,912
有意恩

255
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:31,224
We were on a long-range recon. I got cut off from my unit.
我参加探敌行动，不小心脱队

256
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,100
Nothing like post-traumatic stress disorder to make your day complete.
我看他是个精神错乱的老兵

257
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,004
- Then I saw it... Insectopia! - Hey!
然后我就看到，昆虫乐国

258
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:40,008
You head towards the monolith.
朝着高山前进

259
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:43,376
Ten clicks past the great canyons to the land of red and white.
越过大峡谷和一片红白之地

260
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,381
Hey, gramps. You've had enough for one night.
老爹，你喝多了

261
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:49,011
Come on. Before you get in trouble.
来吧，别惹麻烦

262
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,281
Head for the monolith. Listen to me!
听我说，朝着高山前进

263
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,722
The monolith!

264
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,727
[Chuckles] That guy's got a screw loose.
那家伙头壳坏了

265
00:12:55,795 --> 00:12:58,525
- Cross the lake! - Insectopia. [Scoffs]
划过大湖

266
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:57,985
昆虫乐国

267
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,623
Wouldn't it be great if it were that easy?
豆有这么容易就好了

268
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:04,603
- [Chuckles] Yeah. Dream on, Z. - Cross the lake.
是啊

269
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,995
继续作梦吧

270
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:08,267
Look for the land of red and white.
找到那片红白之地

271
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:13,474
Wow! This is so... gritty.

272
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,006
这地方真是...

273
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:16,746
Ten minutes and we're out of here. Right? This place is off limits.
...有够俗

274
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,047
只能持十分钟，这是禁地

275
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:19,515
Just blame it on me. Say it was all my idea.
怪我吧，就说这是我的主意

276
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:24,992
- It is all your idea. - Besides, no one's gonna recognize us.
本来就是你的主意

277
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:25,058
没有人会认得我们的

278
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:27,462
Come on, girls. What do you say?
来吧，怎么样?

279
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:31,400
Let's take a walk on the wild side.
让我们去野一下吧

280
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,729
[Man On Loud Speaker] 0kay, everybody. 6:15. Time to dance.
大伙儿，六点半，该跳舞了

281
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:39,209
- Time to cut a rug, Z. - 0h, no. That's okay.
跳舞吧，Z

282
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:41,080
不了，我不想磨破我的鞋子

283
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,214
I'm gonna leave the rug just the way it is, Weaver.

284
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,307
** [Jazz, Slow]

285
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,064
Step back, ladies.
你们让开

286
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,364
I'm gonna ask one of these workers to dance with me.
我要邀请一只工蚁陪我跳舞

287
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:01,563
0h.

288
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,208
What a bunch of losers.
这些蚂蚁逊毙了

289
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:08,609
Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system.
就象一群受到压迫的僵尸一样

290
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,707
- Hi. Want to dance? - Absolutely.
嗨，想跳舞吗?

291
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,152
当然想

292
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,048
Follow me.
跟我来

293
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:19,956
So, how come I haven't seen you around here before?
那...我怎么没见过你

294

0h, I don't get out much.
我不常出来玩

295

I, uh, I work over at the palace.
我在皇宫工作

296
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,367
Oh, the palace, huh? I bet those royals really live it up.
皇宫吗?

297
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:30,701
Course they're all a little... you know... from inbreeding.
皇亲贵族一定夜夜笙歌

298
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:31,214
他们都近亲交配，有点那个...

299
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,297
What?
什么?

300
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,071
Yowch!

301
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,550
Ya-Ya... Yowch! Yowch.

302

- Yowch. - What on earth are you doing?

303
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:50,237
你在跳什么舞?

304
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:54,524
Well, actually, to tell you the truth, I'm sort of making it up.
老实说，我是边跳边想

305
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,863
Really?
真的吗?

306
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,404
Why does everybody have to dance the same way?
为什么大家都跳同一种舞

307
00:14:58,473 --> 00:15:00,964
That's completely boring. It's... It's monotonous.
真是无聊透顶

308
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,288
单调枯燥

It's no fun.

Hey. Watch your step, worker.

You watch yours, buddy, or you'll be in big trouble.
你才小心点，我会要你好看

Th-Th-That's okay. I'll... I'm gonna let him off this time.
没关系，这次我饶过他

314

What? Are you crazy? This guy's built like a pebble.
你疯啦?他壮得像头牛

Aren't you even gonna defend yourself?
你不自卫吗?

Hey, buddy. Get back in place.
小子，回到你的位置

我?

他不想回去呢?

00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:57,631
[Clears Throat] Yeah. What if I don't like my place?
是呀，我不喜欢我的位置

320
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,198
- What's he talkin' about? - We got us a troublemaker.
他在说什么?

00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:30,894
A soldier knows that the life of an individual ant doesn't matter.

431
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,178
只有国家最重要

432
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,934
What matters is the colony.
为蚁国而生，为蚁国而战

433
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,562
He's willing to live for the colony, to fight for the colony,

434
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:38,265
to die for the colony.
为蚁国而死

435
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:41,832
- This guy's crazy. - I hear ya.
这家伙秀逗了

436
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,159
说得好

437
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:42,159
八点整

438
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:46,815
At 0800 hours, we received word that the termite enemy has mobilized.
白蚁军团全体动员

439
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:50,445
We have no choice but to launch a preemptive strike.
我们只有先下手为强

440
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,116
You are the queen's finest.
你们是蚁后最优秀的士兵

441
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,989
I know you will all do you duty.
一定全力以赴

442
00:21:56,062 --> 00:21:58,895
I am proud to send you into battle.
我很荣幸派你们上战场

443
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,559
Into... I'm sor-I'm sorry. Into battle?
什么?上战场?

444
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:06,072
- Dismissed. - [Man] Left face. Forward march.
解散

445
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,192
向左转

446
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,192
齐步向前走

447
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,041
You know, I think there's been a terrible mistake.
一定是搞错了

448
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,102
You know, the truth is I just... I just came for the speech.
我只是来听演讲的

449
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,672
Don't worry, kid. I'll watch out for ya.
别怕，小子，我会照顾你

450
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,515
- Sound off. - One! - Two!
报数

451
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:22,743
一...二...

452
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,062
- Sound off. - Three! - Huh?
报数

453
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:24,754
三

454
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,563
- Sound off. - Five!
报数

455
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:30,755
五...六...七...八...

456
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:28,757
- Six! - Seven!

457
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:29,994
- Eight! - Nine!

458
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,057
- Ten! - Eleven!

00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,626
- Twelve! - Thirteen!

460
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:38,075
* We ants go marching one by one Hurrah, hurrah *
我们勇敢地前进，万岁万岁

461
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:42,979
[All] * We slaughter termites just for fun, hurrah, hurrah *
消灭邪恶的白蚁，万岁万岁

462
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,018
- So, these termites, they're-they-re... - ** [Continues, Indistinct]
白蚁不是我们的对手

463
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,815
These guys aren't gonna put up much of a fight? We're talkin' pushovers, right?
我们赢定了，对吧?

464
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:50,720
Not really, kid. They're five times our size.
不对，白蚁比蚂蚁大五倍

465
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:52,589
And they shoot acid from their foreheads.
还会喷出硫酸

466
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:53,855
[Gasps]
矮子，快走

467
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:55,863
- [Grunts] - Hey. Keep it movin', shorty.

468
00:22:55,931 --> 00:23:00,800
[All] * We ants go marching two by two Hurrah, hurrah *
我们勇敢地前进，万岁万岁

469
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:03,908
不怕困难不怕死，万岁万岁

470
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:05,808
* We'll all be dead before we're through Hurrah, hurrah *

471
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:08,072
- ** [Humming] - Say, what exactly does our platoon do?
我们的部队做什么?

472
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:12,480
I mean, will we be serving beverages or processing paperwork?
准备伙食还是处理公文?

473
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,815
Our platoon has the best assignment... first into battle.
我们的任务最棒

474
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:16,150
Huh?
这是先锋部队

475
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:22,491
* We ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah *
我们一个个前进，万岁万岁

476
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,960
万岁万岁!

477
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:27,364
* We're off to face our destiny Hurrah, hurrah *
勇敢地面对命运，万岁万岁

478
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:30,098
Hey. Wait a minute. Let's not get... We're being too hasty here.
慢着，我们太卤莽了

479
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,800
These... These guys sound like bruisers.
敌人这么厉害

480
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,673
Just how were you figuring on beating them?
该怎样打败他们?

481
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:40,842
Superior numbers, kid. Overwhelm their defenses and kill their queen.
用“蚁”海战术

482
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,982
冲破防线，消灭白蚁后

483
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:44,251
Hey, fellas. You're being a little extreme, I feel.
这么做太极端了

484
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,018
W-Why don't we try and influence their political process...
不如用政治现金收买他们

485
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,026
with campaign contributions?

486
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,594
I like you, kid. You got a sense of humor.
我喜欢你，你很幽默

487
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,188
Forward!
向前冲!

488
00:23:54,301 --> 00:23:57,236
Come on. Let's kick some termite butt.
来吧，让白蚁们好看

489
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:00,000
0ver the top!
冲上山头

490
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:03,009
- [All Shouting, Indistinct] - Yeeow!

491
00:24:24,536 --> 00:24:26,470
[Shouting Stops]

492
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,644
- Where is everyone? - Something's not right.
敌军呢?

493
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:35,128
不太对劲

494
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,615
Don't be scared, kid.
别怕，小子

495
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,285
- [Gasps] - [Growls]

Attack!
进攻

498
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:09,153
[Groans]

00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:13,992
Come on.
来吧

500
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,394

501
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,704
Barbatus, you saved my life.
巴贝塔，你救了我

502
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,747
Ah, don't get all sappy about it.
别跟我婆婆妈妈

503
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,727
- Hey, guys. Look out behind you! - [Growls]
大伙，小心后面

504
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:53,739
Hey... Hey, guys.
大伙，帮帮忙

505
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,708
Can somebody help me here? Can anybody... Hey.

506
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,624
Yeah.
好啊

507
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:14,788
[Grunting]

508
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:17,299
Okay, mama. [Grunts] Yeah.
棒呆了

509
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:23,629
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through. [Grunts]
我来也

510
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,280

Hey. Hey. Hey. Take it easy, muscles.

You're makin' the rest of us look bad.
你总得休息一下吧

513
00:26:39,961 --> 00:26:41,929
What happened to Z?
Z怎么了?

514
00:26:41,997 --> 00:26:46,024
He's takin' a personal day, so I'm fillin' in.
他休假，让我代他的班

515
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:49,434
You fill in any more, and you'll explode.

Eh, you got a problem?
你有问题吗?

No, uh... uh...
没有

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,684
Nobody told me digging was so much fun.
没有人说过挖土这么好玩

519

You know, you pick the dirt up. You move it.
把土挖起来，搬过去

520
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:08,226
You pick it up again. You move it again. Lots of reps.
再挖起来，然后搬过去

521
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,558
You exercise the arms and the thorax.

Yes, l... I see what you mean.
我看得出来

523

00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,137
I was just havin' a chat with my friend, sir.
抱歉，长官，我只是在聊天

You know, I just had a chat with General Mandible.
我刚才和曼将军聊过

526

Anybody who doesn't meet his quota is going to be downsized.
达不到标准的工蚁会被炒鱿鱼

Hey. What do you say we help your attitude a little bit...
他是新来的

529
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:36,337
我不如给你一点教训

530
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:40,626
by taking away your rations for the day.
今天不让你吃饭

531

Thanks for your time.
谢谢你

I don't know what came over me.
我是哪根筋不对敢跟他顶嘴

533
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:47,765
Talking back like that.

534
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,600
I must be losin' it.
我一定是疯了

535
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,645
Sorry I got you in trouble.
抱歉害你惹麻烦，不过你可以

536
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,682
But, listen, you can... share my rations. Whoa.
和我一起...

537
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,684
If you want.

- Are you askin' me out to dinner? - [Chuckles]
你要请我吃饭?

539
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:03,551
0h, no. l...
不是啦

540
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:08,063
Well, if you don't have anything else planned.
要是你没别的事

541
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:11,260
[Laughs] I'll check my calendar.
我会查我的事历

542
00:28:11,335 --> 00:28:13,269
You know,
老实说

543
00:28:13,337 --> 00:28:17,034
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.
我很高兴Z今天体假

544
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,911

Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?
老实说，我伤得重吗?

548
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:04,285
N-No. N-Not at all. You're... Actually, you're lookin' terrific.
一点都不重

549
00:29:01,627 --> 00:29:03,555
你的伤势很轻

550
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:07,526
You got, you know, swell color in your cheeks.
脸色很不错

551
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:11,833
No. I can see it in your eyes.

I'm a goner.
我死定了

553
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:18,208
Help me up, Z.
扶我起来

554
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,649
[Sniffs] I can't feel my legs.

555
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:27,451
You gotta hang in there, buddy. I know you're gonna make it.
我的腿没有感觉

556
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,618
撑着点，老兄

557
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:27,617
你一定会活下去的

558
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,991
Just take... take deep breaths.
深呼吸

559
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,258
Because I'm gonna try and find your body.
我去找你的身体

560
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:37,358
It's bound to be out there somewhere.
一定是在...这附近

561
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,976
[Coughs, Sighs]

562
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,535
Barbatus, hang on.
撑着点

563
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,377
- B-Barbatus. - Don't make my mistake, kid.
巴贝塔

564
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,661
别像我一样，小子

565
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,883
Don't follow orders your whole life.
别想着别人的事

566
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:02,055
Think for yourself. [Sighs]
要替自己着想

567
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:07,470
Barbatus.
巴贝塔

568
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:26,190
[Cutter] We're on schedule. Work is completed on "A" section, sir.
我们赶上进度

569
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:26,734
A区已经完成

570
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,558
We're clearing a path through "D" section now.
现在正要凿穿D区

571
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:31,894
We need to push harder, Cutter. I want double shifts around-the-clock.
加把劲，日夜赶工

572
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,865
We can't afford to let up. Is that clear?
不得延误，明白吗?

573
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,563
- Crystal, sir. - Good.
明白，长官

574
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:38,538
- What about section... - Excuse me, sir.
很好

575
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:36,785
至于...

576
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:38,785
报告，长官

577
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,576
This had better be important.
你最好有要事

578
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:42,873
Well, it's about the termite battle, sir.
事关白蚁之役

579
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:47,781
The enemy was destroyed, but it was a disaster for our troops, as well.
敌军全数被歼灭

580
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:47,797
不过我军也死伤惨重

581
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:51,412
Well, that's terrible. Terrible.
真是不幸

582
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:54,925
There is good news, sir. 0ne soldier did make it back.
好消息是，有一名兵蚁生还

583
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,825
- No kidding. - What did you say?
真的还是假的?

584
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:55,807
你说什么

585
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,830
Word is spreading through the colony.
消息已经传开来

586
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,025
The queen requested a meeting with the war hero.
蚁后要见这名英雄

587
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:04,832
Damn! Good. Damn good.
他妈的

588
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,819
真他妈的好，让我来

589
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:07,133
Uh, I'll handle this.

590
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:09,134
[Footsteps Approaching]
恭喜你，小兵

591
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,369
- Congratulations, soldier. - [Clears Throat]

592
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:17,277
[Chuckles] Well, you're a little short for a war hero, aren't you?
你这战争英雄未免太矮

593
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:23,121
A war hero? Sir, I-I don't actually think that I'm a hero.
战争英雄?

594
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,881
我不觉得我是个英雄

595
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:25,286
Good. I don't like heroes.
很好，我不喜欢英雄

596
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:29,800
- But, sir. You don't understand. l... - [Crowd Cheering]
可是你不明白

597
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:31,880
“凯旋归国”

598
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:35,892
“一比零，我们赢了”

599
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:37,837
l... I didn't do anything.
我什么也没做

600
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:41,903
I mean, it was all horrible. It was just a massacre.
太可怕了，那是场屠杀

601
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:44,177
A-A massacre upon a massacre.
屠杀加上滥杀

602
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:46,718
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.
很好，挥手

603
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,598
There was nothing you could do, Weaver.
你也没办法，老魏

604
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:59,032
You didn't know they were going to war.
你不知道他们要打仗

605
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,400
I just feel horrible.
我好内疚

606
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:05,669
Poor Z. I should have never let him go.
可怜的Z

607
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,964
我不该让他去的

608
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:10,009
Wait a minute. That's no soldier. That's Z!
慢着，那不是兵蚁

609
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:08,975
那是Z

610
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:14,246
Z? The little guy made it! [Chuckles]
Z?

611
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:12,976
那小家伙没死

612
00:32:14,353 --> 00:32:16,287
[Crowd Cheering]

613
00:32:18,358 --> 00:32:20,292
Let's go, soldier.
走吧，小兵

614
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:32,937
As I was saying, son, you are an ant after my own heart.
我正在说，我很欣赏你

615
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:35,038
你带着微笑面对死亡挑战

616
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:36,103
An ant that looks death in the face and laughs.

617
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,080
Well, actually, the truth is,
老实说，我通常都躲起来

618
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,084
I-I generally just make belittling comments...

619
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:45,087
and snicker behind death's back. [Chuckles]
背地里说些笑话

620
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,318
General Mandible.
曼将军

621
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:52,988
Keep your comments to yourself. Let me do the talking.
别乱说话，让我来

622
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,798
[Yawns]
这位是女王陛下，蚁后

623
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:04,810
May I present Her Majesty the Queen.

624
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,506
Charmed. Charmed.
幸会，幸会

625
00:33:06,581 --> 00:33:08,572
And the Royal Princess Bala.
以及芭拉公主

626
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,674
[Growls]
欢迎凯旋归国

627
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:12,983
Welcome home, soldier.

628
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:16,752
We cannot begin to express our gratitude for your heroic efforts.
我们非常感谢你英勇杀敌

629
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:19,624
The private has asked me to convey his most humble appreciation.
他要我向你表示最大的谢意

630
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,188
Please. Please. It was nothing really.
不必客气，这不算什么

631
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,962
Just your average run-of-the-mill valor...
我只是跟往常一样英明神武

632
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,505
and extraordinary courageousness, you know.
在战场上没有迟疑的余地

633
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,974
In the heat of battle, there's very little time to think.

634
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:33,124
只能奋不顾身杀敌

635
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:35,275
One must attack! Attack! Attack! [Chuckles]

636
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,839
- [Chuckles] Well, indeed. - [Muffled Talking]
是的

637
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:41,376
As you can see, Your Highness, the battlefield is still fresh in his mind.
陛下，他还是满脑子打仗

638
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:46,688
So, begging your pardon, but this is the perfect time to debrief the private.
恕我们失陪

639
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:46,135
我要请他报告战况

640
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:50,197
Oh, please, General. Not on our first date.
拜托，别这么着急

641
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,291
[Chuckles] Not on our first date.

642
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:54,767
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
我好象见过你

643
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:58,274
Well, maybe. Then again, maybe not.
也许有，也许没有

644
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,275
And then... then again.
不过也许又有

645
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:04,644
- Yowch. - That's it! You're the guy from the bar.

646
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,197
没错，你是酒吧那家伙

647
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:07,513
- Don't... Shh. - Bar? What bar?
什么酒吧?

648
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:10,953
I danced with this guy at the bar the other night.
我跟这家伙在酒吧跳过舞

649
00:34:11,024 --> 00:34:12,958
He was just a worker then.
那时候他是只工蚁

650
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:16,154
- What were you doing at a bar? - Precisely what I want to know.
你跑到酒吧干嘛?

651
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,208
我也想知道

652
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:18,163
No. This isn't about me.
别扯到我身上

653
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:21,463
I mean, look at this worker. Look what he's done.
这只工蚁成为小蚁雄兵

654
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:24,868
I think you're thinkin' of someone else. After all, I am a soldier.
你看错了，我是只兵蚁

655
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:28,374
Exactly. You were a worker.
没错

656
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:30,330
你以前是工蚁，现在变成英雄

657
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:31,072
But now, you're a war hero.

658
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,048
- He's a worker? - A worker danced with my fiancee?
他是工蚁?

659
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:35,340
跟我未婚妻共舞?

660
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:39,487
F-Fiancee? W-W-Wait a minute.
未婚妻?

661
00:34:36,412 --> 00:34:41,341
等等，别想歪，我能解释

662
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:42,218
This is not how it looks. I can explain this.

663
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:44,693
Hey. She was the one making all the moves.
是她先勾引我的

664
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,696
Arrest him.
抓住他

665
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:49,131
H-Hey wait a minute. Take it easy. Can't we discuss this?
别激动，有事好商量

666
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,726
What are you doing? Let go of my daughter.
你在干嘛?放开我女儿

667
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:54,069
He's taking her hostage!
他把她当人质

668
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:54,362
不，不是

669
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,440
No. No. I'm not. I mean, yes, I am.
我是说，没错

670
00:34:56,434 --> 00:35:00,373
别过来，否则她就死

671
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:00,537
One more step and then the princess gets it.

672
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,446
[Grunts] Let go of me!
放开我

673
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,851
Ow! Don't make me hurt her.
别运我杀了她

674
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,162
[Z Yelling]

675
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,362
[Both Screaming]

676
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,138
[Groans] 0h.
你在干嘛？变态佬?

677
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,042
What are you doing, you creep?
你是疯了吗?

678
00:35:27,113 --> 00:35:29,707
Are you out of your puny little mind?
在那儿，快走...

679
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:32,546
[Man] There they are down there! Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

680
00:35:32,653 --> 00:35:35,053
0h, good.
太好了

681
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:37,989
Here they come to rescue me and kill you.
他们会来救我

682
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,492
Kill?
然后杀了你

683
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,487
杀了我?

684
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,494
- Hey, you guys. - Stop it. Stop it.
大伙

685
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,498
住嘴，你干嘛?

686
00:35:41,562 --> 00:35:44,258
- What are you tryin' to do? - Get off me, you little twerp!
放手，臭东西

687
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:47,769
What do you want to do? Throw away everything we've got?
别放弃这难得的自由

688
00:35:47,836 --> 00:35:50,361
What're you waiting for?
你们等什么?

689
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,409
Hello. Guys.
大伙儿

690
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,744
- Huh? - What is it?
那是什么?

691
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:07,589
It's beautiful.
好美哦

692
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,993
Ridgeway, get out of there!
快逃吧

693
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,394
[Both Grunting]

694
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:50,766
[Exhales] [Sighs Softly]

695
00:36:50,844 --> 00:36:54,507
- Oh. Don't worry. I'm okay. - You?
别担心，我没事

696
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:58,678
You're okay? Hey. Who cares about you?
你?你没事?

697
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:59,665
谁管你?我差点没命

698
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,984
- I almost died here. - Will you please calm down?
拜托你冷静点

699
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,753
You're not gonna let a little near-death experience ruin your mood, are you?
你逃过一命应该高兴才对

700
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:09,093
Hey. This is not a mood. You're not listening to me.
我没这个心情

701
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:10,677
你没有听

702
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,066
Where am I?
我在哪里?
