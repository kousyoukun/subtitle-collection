1
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,791
I wonder what reservation
they let him off of?

2
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,156
My truck's overheating.

3
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,433
It's 30 miles to the next station.
I need some water.

4
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,839
Maybe you should've stolen
a better truck, Tonto.

5
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,675
- You've got a big mouth, convict.
- He's only joking, Chief.

6
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,271
- Could I have some water?
- You mean firewater, Tonto?

7
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,439
Jesus Christ. Hold it!

8
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,393
He's a state prisoner, you asshole.

9
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,637
Knock it off.

10
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,549
Hold it, you asshole.

11
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,877
Get out of the way.

12
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,478
Don't move, convict.

13
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,796
APO 657, unit 25 to APO 478.

14
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,356
Escape in progress.
Two officers shot.

15
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,597
Fugitives in a blue flatbed truck.
Two men.

16
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,955
An Indian, tall, 200 pounds,
escaped with Albert Ganz.

17
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,439
They're armed and dangerous.
Get here, quick.

18
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,749
Escape in progress. One Indian
and prisoner Albert Ganz.

19
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,909
If we slept over at your place,
you could put on a clean shirt.

20
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,149
What makes you think I've got
any clean shirts at my place?

21
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,758
Great morning.

22
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,115
I want her young, tall, thin.
Real thin.

23
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,995
She's got to have nice legs.

24
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,192
I don't like jeans. Jeans are cheap.

25
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,556
A dress. A nice summer dress.
No, I know you don't get it.

26
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,595
- What about me?
- I need one more for my friend.

27
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,634
Make her an Indian.
No, not with a turban.

28
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,276
A squaw.

29
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,631
It'll be the Walden Hotel,
near Broadway.

30
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,269
Ask for... G P Polson.

31
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,756
Just be a couple of hours. Right.

32
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,638
- That's a crummy breakfast.
- I've got a crummy day ahead of me.

33
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,960
- What are you talking about?
- Jack, I hate that attitude.

34
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,757
What difference does it make?
I make you feel good.

35
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,112
- What do you want from a guy?
- You make me mad.

36
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,030
I don't have time for this.
I've got to go to work.

37
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,713
- You really are hopeless.
- That's what I always say.

38
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,436
- Call me later.
- You want me to? Good.

39
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,714
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Here, take this.

40
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,117
You know what the man said:

41
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,350
The coldest winter I ever spent, was
the summer I was in San Francisco.

42
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,799
We aren't going by the store again.
We need to save a little bit.

43
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,276
- I liked that carpet.
- We can't afford it.

44
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,632
I know we can't afford it,
but I'd like it.

45
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,960
You want me to go out
and steal for the money?

46
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,516
- Surprise, Luther.
- You were locked up.

47
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,918
- I want the money that Reggie hid.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,148
You want that Indian
to snap her neck?

49
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,591
- We were partners.
- Billy, break it.

50
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,033
No. I'll get you the money,
but I can't get it till Monday.

51
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,519
Honest. The place we've got
it stashed is closed.

52
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,396
Monday morning is when it opens.
I'll get the money right to you.

53
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,914
I always liked you, Luther.
You were fun to hang out with.

54
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,079
- We're going to keep her.
- Trust me.

55
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,230
If you mess with us, I'll put holes
in her you never even thought of.

56
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,035
- Ganz, please.
- Don't fuck up.

57
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,196
Rosie!

58
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,480
- Hey, Algren, need any back up?
- No, you make me nervous.

59
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,992
Your wife makes you nervous.
The radio said you had something on.

60
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,636
A guy named Polson
had his credit cards lifted.

61
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,719
One of Polson's cards rented
that green coupe over there.

62
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,231
It's just a laugher?

63
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,750
It was a kid with a switchblade.

64
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,909
- Well, you guys are experts.
- We don't need any big artillery.

65
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,477
I'm just trying to help out.
I love to watch pros work.

66
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,468
- I don't need your help.
- You can come in.

67
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,956
Stake out the lobby.
How's the car running?

68
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,678
- How's the wife?
- Mean as a snake.

69
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,350
You guys were in last week.
I'm not supposed to be hassled.

70
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,395
- We just want to search a room.
- Not unless you've got a warrant.

71
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,470
- You should've been a lawyer.
- What the shit is this?

72
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,468
- We're looking for a Mr. Polson.
- Room 27.

73
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,672
- Okay, get it over with.
- Is he alone?

74
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,111
A couple of girls went up.

75
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,030
- You guys be careful.
- And you stake out the lobby.

76
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,197
- I'll let you handle it, Al.
- Thank you.

77
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,913
This isn't exactly
my life's ambition.

78
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,514
It's a part-time thing. I've got a
kid who's staying with his granny.

79
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,272
You don't want to hear personal
stuff. Are you listening to me?

80
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,599
Did you hear a goddamn word I said?

81
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,870
How much money have you got left?

82
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,109
Hi, Liz. It's me.
What's going on?

83
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,036
Nothing, just a couple of cops.
How was your date?

84
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,351
You've got to stop
sitting still for that kind of shit.

85
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,429
Ask who it is. Right?

86
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,875
- Who is it?
- Police, open up.

87
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,789
- Open up, right now.
- Keep stalling.

88
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,357
Hang on,
I've got to put something on.

89
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,517
When I tell you to jump,
you jump.

90
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,838
Call for help now!

91
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,640
Operator?

92
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,037
Jack, there are two of them.

93
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,872
Stay here.

94
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,559
- Operator...
- Drop the phone, lady.

95
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,510
Let me go.

96
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,394
Billy, bring her out.
He ain't going to shoot.

97
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,037
Come on.

98
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,833
Shut up.

99
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,954
My God!

100
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,910
No!

101
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,038
You, toss me that piece,
and he won't waste him.

102
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,639
Jack, don't give them the gun.
Don't do it!

103
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,438
Don't do that for me.

104
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,949
Get the car.

105
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,876
Nice gun.

106
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,518
- What happened?
- Read the report.

107
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,157
Two cops get blown away
by a credit card booster?

108
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,751
- Those guys were good cops.
- They fucked up.

109
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,238
That's what you say,
that's what you always say.

110
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,831
- We're always fucking up.
- The truth hurts.

111
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,476
- It don't figure.
- Can I borrow a piece?

112
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,468
When somebody steals your gun
you usually file a report.

113
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,470
Two cops died
because you fucked up.

114
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,558
That isn't going to bring them back.

115
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,914
Cates, I want to see you right away.
Do you read me?

116
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,398
I hear you. Your voice carries.
Five minutes.

117
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,194
There's a lot of people
getting shot with 44s lately.

118
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,474
People must be getting
mad about something.

119
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,357
- You're an accessory to murder.
- Give me a break.

120
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,836
His real name is Albert Ganz.

121
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,749
He's from back East,
but did an armed robbery out here.

122
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,475
He broke out of prison
a couple of days ago.

123
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,638
A real animal. Read this.

124
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,236
Did he give you a return match,
or didn't he like the merchandise?

125
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,910
- Fuck you.
- I'll take a rain check.

126
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,033
This is from the first weapon
Ganz used.

127
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,233
It's a perfect match,
but it's not from the Walden Hotel.

128
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,991
It was fired six hours earlier.
We found him on a park bench.

129
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,953
There are some bad people out there.

130
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,039
If there weren't,
what the hell would we have to do?

131
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,156
He took me down, then he put on
the TV. Then you people arrived.

132
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,388
That's it, but I think he's going
to give you guys a hard time.

133
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,991
He likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid.

134
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,035
This is his stuff from the hotel.
The big guy's room was empty.

135
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,710
A speedloader.
This guy's got a 44 like yours.

136
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,879
- He's serious about his artillery.
- Here's the files.

137
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,835
- Billy Bear.
- He's worked with Ganz before.

138
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,999
- Who's this guy?
- Henry Wong. He worked with them.

139
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,320
Kehoe, come here.
I want to show you something.

140
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,274
- Tell me, same guy?
- Dick Fucking Tracy.

141
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,430
- Any of these guys still around?
- One of them is in the slammer.

142
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,189
- Get in here, Cates.
- Yeah!

143
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,952
Goddamn speedloader! Kehoe.

144
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,110
I want to be left alone on this one.

145
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,917
There's an official department
policy about cop killings.

146
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,432
Any man crazy enough to kill a cop
is a great danger to civilians.

147
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,839
We can't seem
like we're in the revenge business.

148
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,998
What's bothering you?

149
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,237
It bothers me when cops get killed.

150
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,319
You might be more of a team player
on this one, hot dog.

151
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,150
Hotdogging has been working
real well so far. I've got a lead.

152
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,079
You can do things your own way.

153
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,912
You nail this guy
and make us all look good.

154
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,590
But if you screw up,
you're going down.

155
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,749
You know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude.

156
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,636
- I'm here to see Reggie Hammond.
- He's in 18.

157
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,037
- You want company?
- No, thank you.

158
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,315
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to sell your body to the night</i>

159
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,393
<i>Roxanne you don't have</i>
<i>to put on the red light</i>

160
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,233
<i>you walk the streets for money</i>
<i>don't care if it's wrong or right</i>

161
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,159
<i>Roxanne!</i>

162
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,353
Is that Hammond?

163
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,271
- Hammond.
- <i>Put on the red light!</i>

164
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,711
- <i>Put on the red light!</i>
- Hammond!

165
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,834
- Have you got a name, cop?
- Cates. I want to talk to you in private.

166
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,839
You're single,
no fixed address, no relatives.

167
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,635
One conviction, armed robbery.
Six months to go.

168
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,594
- Are you writing my life story?
- Not likely.

169
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,837
I just need a little help.

170
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,759
It's Henry Wong. An old friend
of mine. He's looked better.

171
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,195
I've been in that cell for 2½ years.
I'm getting out in 6 months.

172
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,713
You've come to the wrong person.
I don't fuck my old friends over.

173
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,232
That's too bad. I thought
maybe you were a smart boy.

174
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,115
I guess if you were real smart,
you wouldn't be a convict.

175
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,438
A second-rater like you
would be no help against Ganz.

176
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,792
Ganz will be in jail
for two years after I get out.

177
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,518
It didn't work out that way.
A big Indian busted him out.

178
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,996
- Cates.
- Yeah?

179
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,751
I can help you get Ganz
if you get me out of here first.

180
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,555
To get him
I've got to be on the street.

181
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,550
I want Ganz as bad as you,
and we've got no time.

182
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,593
- Bullshit.
- I'm serious.

183
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:01,511
- Get me out of here.
- I'll think about it, Reggie.

184
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,473
Cates!

185
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,639
You've got to get me
out of here, man!

186
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,190
Cates!

187
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,109
Fuck you!

188
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,509
- Let me borrow your pen, Bob.
- Are you using your own name?

189
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,234
Shit, no.

190
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,639
If all this comes down,
I'm not going to burn for you.

191
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,119
And if it comes down,
your ass is new-mown grass.

192
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,392
- You've got him for 48 hours.
- Sure thing.

193
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,152
You've got a big career ahead of you
as a forger.

194
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,151
- Hammond.
- Okay, send him through.

195
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,876
You've got to sign him.
He's all yours.

196
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,748
- You need me more than you thought.
- That shows you how desperate I am.

197
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,272
- Is that suit prison issue?
- $957. I wore this shit in.

198
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,110
- We're after a killer.
- My reputation is as a ladies' man.

199
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,030
Maybe we can get you dressed
and go on a pussy hunt.

200
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,597
I've already got that department
taken care of.

201
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,555
You've got a lady? The generosity
of women never ceases to amaze me.

202
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,355
I don't work like this. No deal.

203
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,918
- We have no deal. I own your ass.
- What a way to start a partnership.

204
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,669
We ain't partners,
brothers, or friends.

205
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,111
I'm keeping you
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

206
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,553
If Ganz gets away, you're going
to be sorry you ever met me.

207
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,990
I'm already sorry.

208
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,395
This is your car? It looks like
you bought it from a brother.

209
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,956
I got you out. Where are we going?

210
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,436
We've got to see
a guy called Luther.

211
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,996
- Is Luther part of the gang?
- What gang, Jack?

212
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,912
I can read a police file, shithead,
and quit calling me Jack.

213
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,274
- It's better than shithead.
- I may call you worse than that.

214
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,436
Right up there,
but he isn't expecting company.

215
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,988
Luther isn't very stable.
I don't want you getting shot.

216
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,351
Right there. 232.

217
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,911
- What are the chances he's packed?
- 100%.

218
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,918
You'd better leave me a gun.

219
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,636
Sure thing, asshole.
You just hang on.

220
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,393
I hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

221
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,880
What's happening, Luther?
Did that hurt? It looked real painful.

222
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,471
Luther, I'm talking to you.

223
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,789
- Hammond, drop that gun.
- Don't point that gun at me.

224
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,596
- Don't point your gun at me!
- Hand me that gun.

225
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,790
- I'm looking for Ganz.
- I haven't seen him for years.

226
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,959
You just took a shot at me.
I think you know where Ganz is.

227
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,517
Who gives a fuck what you think?

228
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,317
You better tell this boy something.
He's having a ball with this door.

229
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,518
Luther, are you angry with me?

230
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,589
What are you smiling at?
Your big move turned out to be shit.

231
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,633
I was defending myself.

232
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,310
- I want to make a citizen's arrest.
- Shut up!

233
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,071
- What have you got there, Jack?
- Carrying a concealed weapon.

234
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,478
Resisting arrest.
I'll think up some more tomorrow.

235
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,196
- I bet you will.
- Get him out of here.

236
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,836
- Bye, Luther.
- Fuck you, Reggie.

237
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,270
I want a lawyer.

238
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,875
You stay right here... okay?

239
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,038
Get your hands off me.

240
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,472
You ladies look like
you need some assistance.

241
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,196
We don't need some court-appointed
lawyer trying to bullshit us.

242
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,633
The city is coming down
on people involved with vice.

243
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,159
- Hello?
- Jack Cates, any messages?

244
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,879
Some lady called to say she still
wants her occasional roommate.

245
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,835
<i>She'd like to talk it over</i>
<i>tonight after work. </i>

246
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:21,479
Look, Elaine, I don't know
when I'll be able to come by.

247
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,513
I'm working too hard at this.

248
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,236
I'm not happy about it. I've got
a few things to take care of.

249
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,070
This is not the way people
who care about each other behave.

250
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,191
Shit!

251
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,552
You're both going to do
a little time. 30 days each...

252
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,550
...unless we talk
some real business.

253
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,834
- We can go in this room.
- Let's go.

254
00:33:53,040 --> 00:34:00,754
- I was about to get some trim.
- We're not on a trim hunt.

255
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,909
- My stomach is starting to growl.
- We eat when I say we eat.

256
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,956
I want some food now. If you
don't like it, take me back to jail.

257
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:18,349
You've been treating me like shit.
I want to eat in a nice place.

258
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,839
Hold it. I'm hungry.
Let's go get something to eat.

259
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,952
I want mandolins and violins...

260
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,874
Here...
There's your goddamn dinner.

261
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,470
Come on.

262
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,831
- Who was that on the phone?
- None of your business.

263
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,431
- Keep your mouth shut.
- I think it was your lady.

264
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,794
- What's her problem?
- The same as half the population.

265
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,709
She can't get the job she wants.
It pisses her off.

266
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,037
- What do you care?
- I'm in jail.

267
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,233
I was surrounded by guys
in blue suits 24 hours a day.

268
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,796
The clothes you wear,
you look like you'd love it.

269
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,790
- Where to, convict?
- Mission District. Indian hangout.

270
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,989
- Tell me about your girlfriend.
- I don't give out details.

271
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,715
I've been in prison. I'm tired
of hearing lies about pussy.

272
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,878
- Was it last week?
- Last night.

273
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,117
- Was it fun?
- Yeah...

274
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,154
In the morning
we got in a fucking argument.

275
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,670
At least you took care
of business first.

276
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,519
Does she have big titties?

277
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,158
I can see this is going
to be a long night, convict.

278
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,789
- What's the deal?
- Billy used to work at this club.

279
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,152
- I heard him talk about it.
- This is a bad neighborhood.

280
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,592
You just back me up.
Pretend like you've got a piece.

281
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,236
They may beat me up,
but they'd kill you.

282
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,389
It's amazing how far a gun
and a badge will take some guys.

283
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,390
A bullshit attitude and experience
is what gets you through.

284
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,073
White cops
used to fuck with me and my friends.

285
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,195
- They just flash their badges.
- Experience is what counts.

286
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,153
- You want to bet?
- Two problems.

287
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,273
I ain't playing games,
and you've got nothing to bet with.

288
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,589
If we get any kind of lead, turn
your back and let me get some pussy.

289
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,679
Any man who talks about women
like you, can't get it up anyhow.

290
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,237
I've been in prison for three years.
My dick gets hard if the wind blows.

291
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,516
It's a bet, but when you lose,
you tell me the truth.

292
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,918
- What is Ganz after?
- What are you talking about?

293
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,271
Fuck you! The bet's off.

294
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,074
All right, look...

295
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,398
If I lose, I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

296
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,589
You've got a deal. Hell, I might
even give you my badge.

297
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,951
Bullshit and experience
is all it takes.

298
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,792
Come on and experience
some of my bullshit.

299
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,393
Not a popular place
with the brothers.

300
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,435
I always liked country boys.
They'll sure as hell like you.

301
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,079
Howdy.

302
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,473
- How do?
- Yeah?

303
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,956
I'd like something to drink.
Vodka.

304
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,913
How about a Black Russian?

305
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,511
Black Russian. That's a funny joke.

306
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,317
I'm black,
but I'd rather have plain old vodka.

307
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,318
As we're standing here talking, -

308
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,196
- I wonder if you know
where I could find Billy Bear?

309
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,838
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of Billy Bear?

310
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,237
Look here...

311
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,836
- You heard of him now?
- What are you talking about?

312
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,670
- I'll look around for a while.
- I don't give a shit what you do.

313
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,235
Good.

314
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,754
I've never seen so many backward-ass
country fucks in my life.

315
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,794
You look like regulars.
I'm looking for Billy Bear.

316
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,594
This is our place, nigger.

317
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,236
You're a big, tough, country faggot.

318
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,471
Are you out of your mind?
Get up against that pole.

319
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,038
Do you think
I'm playing a goddamn game?

320
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,509
This is a police matter. I'm looking
for an Indian named Billy Bear.

321
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,349
I know everybody in here
wants to cooperate with me.

322
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,839
That's not even necessary.
I've got the situation in hand.

323
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,632
Some of us citizens
are behind you all the way, officer.

324
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,836
- What's you problem?
- I'm on parole.

325
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,873
Sit your country ass down.

326
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,600
Listen up.

327
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,156
I don't like white people.
I hate rednecks.

328
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,751
You people are rednecks.
I'm enjoying this shit.

329
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,439
- You're loaded here.
- Tax refund.

330
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,076
Bullshit!
You're too stupid to have a job.

331
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,113
You don't like that?
You hate that shit, right?

332
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:57,190
- What kind of cop are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.

333
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,791
I'm a nigger with a badge. I can
kick your ass whenever I like.

334
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,353
One of them was underage,
another attacked a police officer.

335
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,791
You're going out of business.

336
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,709
Let's see
what we can fuck with next.

337
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,713
Okay, listen... The Indian
hangs out with a chick up the block.

338
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,674
Chinatown. She lives
on top of the jewellery store.

339
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,113
- I didn't ask about the girl.
- You'll have to settle for that.

340
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,756
That's all I know.

341
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,758
Look, hoss, you start
running a respectable business -

342
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,398
- and I won't have to come in here
and hassle you every night.

343
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,194
The rest of you cowboys should know
that there's a new sheriff in town.

344
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,356
His name is Reggie Hammond.
You all be cool.

345
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,239
- How's it going?
- You've got something for me.

346
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,958
- What are you talking about?
- The gun you took off the redneck.

347
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,150
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

348
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,592
- There you go.
- And the switchblade.

349
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,798
You don't miss anything, Jack.

350
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,992
It was real smooth how I took it.

351
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,354
You owe me a piece of ass.
Give me the gun, we'll call it even.

352
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,429
You did a good job, Reggie.
You deserve a reward.

353
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,950
Here.

354
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,318
- Fucking bastard.
- That I am.

355
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,311
Hey! Let's go get us an Indian
down the alley.

356
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,670
I don't think anybody's home.

357
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,350
Let's check around back.

358
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,629
I hope we have as much fun
as we had in that hillbilly bar.

359
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,311
Did you see the way
I handled those boys?

360
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,992
Why don't you get a megaphone
and announce we're coming?

361
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,675
- What the hell are they watching?
- I don't know.

362
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,149
TV has changed. Get this.

363
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,875
That must be Billy's girlfriend.

364
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,999
- Police, nobody move.
- Stay where you are.

365
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,796
- Drop it, or he gets another one.
- This girl thinks she's Babe Ruth.

366
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,357
- Police. Put the goddamn gun down.
- Don't give me that police shit.

367
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,951
Look, don't shoot.

368
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,312
I'm just going
to reach for my badge.

369
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,079
- I've seen fake badges before.
- Hey, sweetheart...

370
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,352
Listen up.
This guy's one nervous cop.

371
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,109
Shut up! I'm the calm type.

372
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,233
I know you don't want me
to shoot you.

373
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,910
Just hand me over the gun.

374
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,355
- You assholes better be real.
- Hey, let's see your badge.

375
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,475
- I don't have a badge.
- Call the cops.

376
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,558
Put that phone down. You're both
going to answer some questions.

377
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,228
All right...
which one of you sees Billy Bear?

378
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,356
The son of a bitch isn't here
and he's not coming back.

379
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:57,317
- You can do better than that.
- He hasn't been here for two weeks.

380
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,275
It sounds like a stormy romance.

381
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,270
Yeah, I went a couple of laps
around the track with him.

382
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,677
Wait, I've been
in prison for three years.

383
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,829
Maybe these ladies would like
to go around the track with us.

384
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,476
- Fuck off.
- Come on.

385
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,879
If you find Billy,
tell him to stay out of my life.

386
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,036
Let's go.

387
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,990
This sucks!

388
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,318
A maniac gets hold of my gun
and starts killing people with it.

389
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,229
I ought to be at home in bed
with my girl, -

390
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,118
- not out on the streets
with a charcoal-colored loser.

391
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,710
Just leave.
I can take care of Ganz by myself.

392
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,992
You can't take care of shit.

393
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,911
You've been dicking me around
since we started.

394
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,079
- You've given me nothing.
- I'm impressed with you, too.

395
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,875
Kicking in the door
on a couple of dikes.

396
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,835
Either Luther or you has to tell me
what the fuck this is all about.

397
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,032
You got 48 hours.
The clock's running.

398
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,870
- I don't like the way you ask me.
- Who gives a damn?

399
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,471
You're just a crook
on a weekend pass.

400
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,673
You're just a spear-chucker
with a prison number.

401
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,713
I'm through fucking around.

402
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,674
Tell me the truth
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

403
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,035
You're going to kick my ass?
You've lost your mind.

404
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,312
I'm not in the mood.

405
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,229
It's going to be embarrassing
for you and the police force.

406
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,796
Look, nigger, I fight dirty.

407
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,558
You little fucker!

408
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,278
Don't put me in the fucking garbage!
Get the fuck off!

409
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,755
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

410
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,270
- It's all right. I'm a cop.
- Get your hands up.

411
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,271
I'm too fucking tired.
My gun and badge are in the car.

412
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,075
Check it out, Bill.
Get in the car.

413
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,913
What the hell is going on?

414
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:54,319
Two women called and said a couple
of hoods broke in to their place.

415
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,277
We rousted them.
You can straighten it out.

416
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,793
Why don't you do it yourself?
We've got better things to do.

417
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,393
- I'll file a report tomorrow.
- I'll file a report tonight.

418
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,036
It goes with the territory.

419
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,908
- It's good your friends came.
- You want to try it again?

420
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,591
- You'd call your buddies back.
- They saved your ass.

421
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:39,511
- That's what you'll tell them.
- I'll put it in my report.

422
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,429
I bet you will.

423
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,669
- How much do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

424
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,796
Mother fucker!

425
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:03,712
You come clean or we're going again,
right here and now.

426
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,959
I want to know what's going on
between you and Ganz.

427
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,595
I've been waiting for some money
for a long time... $ ½ million.

428
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,832
Are you starting to get the picture?

429
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,874
Tell me about the money.

430
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,710
Me and some friends
hit a dealer during a sale.

431
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,912
It's the kind of money
nobody reports stolen.

432
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:44,150
One of the guys dropped dime on me.
He now has your gun.

433
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,990
- He's after your money?
- You're a real bright cop.

434
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,399
How much do you want?
Do you want to split it 50-50?

435
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,309
- Not likely, convict.
- I can't have any of it?

436
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,035
I believe in the merit system, boy.

437
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,394
- I'll be real good from now on.
- Where's the money?

438
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,390
In the trunk of my car.

439
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,353
Right, partner.

440
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,272
But get this: We ain't brothers,
partners or friends.

441
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,270
If Ganz gets away with my money,
you'll be sorry you ever met me.

442
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,637
- Where's the goddamn car?
- Be cool, the car's parked.

443
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,958
- For three years? Bullshit!
- Bullshit?

444
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,711
I'll let you in on a little secret.
You just passed it.

445
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,599
- Now what?
- Now you get to play cop.

446
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,191
Watch that building
while I have a sleep.

447
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,520
You son of a bitch! You knew
where the money was all along.

448
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,078
- I almost got my ass shot off.
- Being a cop is a hard job.

449
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,593
The garage opens at seven o'clock.
Wake me up at a quarter to.

450
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,239
Jack, tell me a story.

451
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,956
- Fuck you!
- That's one of my favorites.

452
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,196
Yeah, yeah...

453
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,833
- You're sleeping on the job.
- They open in five minutes.

454
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,999
- Go look for Ganz.
- You took a chance leaving it here.

455
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,433
I knew Ganz was away.
I knew Luther wouldn't cross me.

456
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,679
Luther just crossed the street.

457
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,713
The guy took a shot at a cop
and is back out on the street.

458
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,196
The judicial system is shit.

459
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,839
- I want to pick up my car.
- What's the name?

460
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,474
Reggie Hammond.

461
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,116
- This is three years old.
- Yeah, I've been busy!

462
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,668
Al, bring out 29-012.
It's been here three years.

463
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,796
- Charge the battery.
- We do that every month.

464
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,158
Thanks a lot.

465
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,032
There he is.

466
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,234
Look at all the dust on my car.
He should take it to a car wash.

467
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,477
I didn't know darker people
went in for foreign jobs.

468
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,038
Some white asshole had just bought
the last shitty sky-blue Cadillac.

469
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,032
I hope none of my fellas
sees me riding around in this car.

470
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,915
- I don't care how it looks.
- It has no class.

471
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:20,831
Class isn't something you buy.
Look at you in that $500 suit.

472
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,712
- Is that suit yours?
- They used to be in style.

473
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,313
If you switch from armed robbery
to pimping, you're all set.

474
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,156
That's the money.

475
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,516
Look out!

476
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,311
Hey, put that down.

477
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,315
Luther!

478
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,838
I'm going after the money.

479
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:27,711
Come on. Stay close.

480
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,597
- Freeze.
- I'm a cop.

481
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,992
Meet me at Vroman's,
and bring the shit. Thank you.

482
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,590
Vodka with a twist,
and I'd like to run up a tab.

483
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,119
- Hey, baby, I'm Reggie Hammond.
- So what?

484
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:55,997
- Hey, my name's Reggie Hammond.
- I'm with somebody.

485
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,270
How you doing?
My name's Reggie Hammond.

486
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,714
This ain't my night.

487
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,915
- You look awful.
- Yeah? Well, so do you.

488
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:53,070
From what I've heard, you've
lost Ganz for the second time.

489
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,479
And some soul brother
beat the crap out of you.

490
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,389
- Did any calls come in?
- Nothing.

491
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,755
- Kehoe.
- Ordnance.

492
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,673
- <i>Your reports are late, Cates. </i>
- They'll be in tomorrow.

493
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,115
You can depend on it.
Bullshit.

494
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,437
- I'm heading out.
- I've got to wait for a call.

495
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,792
You really ought to get some rest.

496
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,357
Yeah, he's here.
Cates, for you. Line three.

497
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,117
- Motherfucker, where are you?
- I'm at work, asshole.

498
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:45,873
Elaine, I'm sorry. I thought it was
somebody else. Police business.

499
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:54,351
- No wonder you're so popular.
- I'm sorry about all this.

500
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,994
- Jack.
- Jack?

501
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,274
I almost forgot, your pal
from the vice squad phoned.

502
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:09,670
- You rousted a bar with him last night.
- Why didn't you tell me?

503
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,270
- What's the goddamn number?
- It's on my desk.

504
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,476
- I've got to put you on hold.
- Don't put me on hold.

505
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,837
You son of a bitch.

506
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,431
It's under the light.

507
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,473
- Reggie Hammond.
- Where are you?

508
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:50,118
I've been waiting for you to call.

509
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,552
I'm at Vroman's in the Filmore.

510
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:59,754
I know you don't know the place.
The brothers hang out here.

511
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,317
I'll be right there.
Don't move your ass.

512
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,354
- Elaine's on the other line.
- Jesus!

513
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,796
- Elaine?
- Jack... Fuck you!

514
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,719
Shit.

515
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,792
- My name is Reggie.
- I'm Candy.

516
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,278
Look, if I don't get some trim
tonight, I'm going to bust.

517
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,793
- You know, sex.
- Can't you ask me better than that?

518
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,795
It's 10:05, by 10:10,
I want to be into some flesh.

519
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,755
Let's go across the street...
I don't have any money.

520
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,430
You can't even pay for the room?

521
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,553
Jack, I want you to meet
my friend Candy.

522
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,513
- Hello.
- And goodbye.

523
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,033
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- I hope so. You're so rude.

524
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,119
- Where's Luther?
- Where's Ganz?

525
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,996
You missed him. Luther took a cab
to the hotel across the street.

526
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,193
- Maybe we should pay him a visit.
- It makes no sense.

527
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,871
There's a Do Not Disturb sign
on his door. We'll see him tomorrow.

528
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,631
- That way we'll catch Ganz.
- Why don't you just take the money?

529
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,152
I could have done that,
but I want Ganz as much as you do.

530
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,114
I'll let you in on a secret...

531
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:17,437
Keep it. I'm too tired
to argue about that.

532
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,590
Thanks for calling.

533
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,071
Calling you a nigger,
I didn't mean that stuff.

534
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,068
I was just doing my job
and keeping you down.

535
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,752
Doing your job
don't explain everything, Jack.

536
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:55,673
As long as you're being Abe Lincoln,
you see that girl?

537
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,078
She'd love to take me to a hotel
and fuck my brains out.

538
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:05,673
- I need the money for a room.
- I've got...

539
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,319
- 20.
- That should be fine.

540
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,513
- Have fun.
- I'll have sex, Jack.

541
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,870
- You come here often?
- This is my favorite place.

542
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,598
This is my wife.
Are you whispering in my wife's ear?

543
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,236
I've got rent money for one night.

544
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:42,399
Lack of pussy makes you brave, man!
Let's go.

545
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,272
- Where do you want to go?
- Over to the hotel.

546
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,473
Shit! Excuse me, please.

547
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,957
- Wait a minute!
- That was quick.

548
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,709
Luther's on the move.

549
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,553
Open your coat... both sides.

550
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,076
- Let her go.
- Money first.

551
01:13:54,280 --> 01:14:00,594
Show me. Set it there.

552
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,033
- Rosalie, are you okay?
- What are you talking about?

553
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,277
I said I wouldn't hurt her.

554
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,917
Goddamn! You lost a stolen bus!

555
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,989
Five deaths are related to Ganz, and
you blow it for a nigger convict.

556
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,194
I called him a nigger,
you bet I did.

557
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:34,555
That piece of shit hasn't spent
one legal day in his life.

558
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,469
This is it for you.
Suspension, review board.

559
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,958
- You're protecting a con!
- Goddamn it!

560
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:49,674
This man has got more brains
than you'll ever know.

561
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:56,274
- He's got more guts, too.
- That don't mean shit to me!

562
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,472
Let's get out of here.

563
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,115
Where do you think you're going?

564
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,791
- Don't be so hard on the guy.
- You go fuck yourself, convict.

565
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,238
- How did my car get here?
- I had it impounded.

566
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:38,514
- You're going back to the slammer.
- Ganz got away with all my money.

567
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,510
Now you're taking me to jail in my
own car. That don't seem right.

568
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,759
A lot of things don't seem right.

569
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:53,159
I could use a drink. I'll buy.
It'll be my goodbye present.

570
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:59,151
- I feel like I let you down.
- No, it was a longshot.

571
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,434
- We gave 'em a hell of a run.
- But we didn't catch 'em.

572
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,189
- Hello?
- <i>Let me talk to Kehoe. </i>

573
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,512
Kehoe, answer the damn phone.
It's for you.

574
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,871
- How's it going?
- <i>Not so good. </i>

575
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,755
- How about the other guys?
- They're on the street.

576
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,556
- Airport? Train station?
- They're clean.

577
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:11,869
They dumped the bus in Chinatown.
Other than that, we've got nothing.

578
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,959
I'll get back to you later.

579
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,079
Nothing! No Ganz, no Indian.

580
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:29,149
Airport's clean, bus station,
train station, docks... Shit!

581
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,911
It's too bad. Our partnership
ended before it got started.

582
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,032
Some partnership.

583
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,394
- What's up with your lady?
- We had another fight. Why?

584
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,878
If I was depressed and had a lady,
I'd go and see her.

585
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,676
No, I'll make it up to her tomorrow.

586
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:59,275
- What about that big Indian's girl?
- He won't be going back there.

587
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,473
They found the bus
down in Chinatown.

588
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:09,073
- Maybe he's visiting his girl.
- Billy's girl isn't interested.

589
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,795
- She'll put a bullet in him.
- Yeah, I'm reaching.

590
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,959
Well, you've got important things
to do, like going back to jail.

591
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,516
- Chinatown?
- Yeah.

592
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,397
There she is, Jack.

593
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,788
What ever play I make, back me up.

594
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,436
Come on.

595
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,118
I hear you've got visitors.
Don't give me any crap.

596
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,198
Answer my questions!

597
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,949
You're Billy's girl.
You've always been his girl.

598
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,392
The man can live or die,
it's up to you. Let us in.

599
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,878
Otherwise he's a dead man.

600
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,311
- He's in the room down the hall.
- Where's Ganz?

601
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:34,435
- Down the other corridor.
- All right, come on.

602
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,192
Give it up, Billy.
You've got no chance.

603
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,398
Billy, you're going to lose.

604
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,276
Get down!

605
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,794
Come on.

606
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,553
It's all over.

607
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,629
I'll kill you!

608
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,869
You ought to know, Reggie, if you
come up against me you will lose.

609
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,517
There's one more little thing
I've got to take care of.

610
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,476
Hey, cop, come on.
I've got something for you.

611
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,958
- You're not going to make it.
- What are you talking about?

612
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,597
I've got your gun. I've got
the money. I've got everything.

613
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,674
- Blow his fucking brains out.
- Bullshit! He won't try it.

614
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,916
Right, cop?

615
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,429
Are you crazy, man?
I was just bluffing.

616
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:30,076
I got hit!
I don't believe it. I got shot.

617
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,116
- You're done, end of story.
- You!

618
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,192
I've got to go, okay?

619
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:17,278
- Here's something for you.
- I'm not a pro.

620
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,155
Buy yourself something.
I'm in a rush.

621
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,638
I've got a cop
waiting for me downstairs.

622
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:33,230
I'll be back in about six months
and we'll go dancing.

623
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:39,231
- Okay, take care of yourself.
- You, too.

624
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,271
See you later.

625
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,995
So tell me how great you were.

626
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,510
I don't go in for that macho shit.

627
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:08,032
I was great.
I should have my dick bronzed.

628
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,875
Is this what you want to talk about?

629
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,312
I've been waiting for that money
for three years.

630
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,876
Where's your
merit-system shit now?

631
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,914
It's your money.
It'll be there when you get out.

632
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,636
- You don't want any of it?
- It's not my style.

633
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,312
I need a car. Loan me a couple
of thousand when you get out.

634
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:51,229
- What kind of car do you want?
- A convertible. I'm a rag-top man.

635
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,672
- Deal.
- Good.

636
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,429
Even if you do give me the money
for a car, it don't mean shit.

637
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,839
If I ever hear of you crossing
the line, I'll bust your ass.

638
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:23,114
Both of us know that I'm going
to be honest from now on.

639
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:31,950
But if I did decide to be a thief,
do you think you could catch me?

640
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:37,709
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?

641
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:18,119
