1
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,697
Wonder what reservation
they let him off of.

2
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,288
Excuse me, sir.

3
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:31,125
But my truck's overheating,
and it's 30 miles to the next station.

4
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,836
Can I get some water out of your cooler,
please, sir?

5
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,48
Maybe you should've stole
a better truck, Tonto.

6
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,349
You got a big mouth, convict.

7
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,102
Take it easy, Chief. He's only joking.

8
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,854
Okay. Can I have the water, please, sir?

9
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,399
Firewater, Tonto?
Is that what you mean?

10
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:55,983
Firewater, huh?

11
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,653
Hey! Jesus Christ!

12
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,530
Hold it!

13
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,658
He's a state prisoner, you asshole!

14
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,494
Goddamn you two! Knock it off!

15
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,455
Hold it, you asshole!

16
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,295
Get out of the way!

17
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,635
Don't move, convict!

18
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,64
Fuck you!

19
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,275
APO 657, unit 25 to APO 478!

20
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:38,776
Roger, APO.

21
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,279
Escape in progress! Two officers shot!

22
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:44,574
Fugitives are driving
a blue flatbed pickup truck!

23
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:47,201
Two men! One of them is an Indian!

24
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:50,288
Tall! 6'4", 200 pounds.

25
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:54,125
The other one's Albert Ganz.
They're armed and dangerous.

26
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,627
God, we need help! Get it here quick!

27
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,463
Say again, 25.

28
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,965
Escape in progress! Two fugitives!

29
00:05:01,49 --> 00:05:03,551
One Indian and prisoner Albert Ganz!

30
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,14
You know, if you let me come over
to your place once in a while,

31
00:05:50,98 --> 00:05:52,683
you could put on a clean shirt
in the morning.

32
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,772
What makes you think
I got any clean shirts at my place?

33
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:05,947
Great morning.

34
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,458
Yeah. I want her young, tall, thin.

35
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:20,461
Yeah, real thin.
She's got to have nice legs.

36
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,588
Yeah. Legs are important.

37
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,551
No, no jeans. I don't like jeans.
Jeans are cheap.

38
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:29,637
A dress. Yeah, a nice summer dress.

39
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,806
I want her fresh, you know?

40
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,58
No, I know you don't get it.

41
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,310
Hey, what about me?

42
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,105
Yeah. And I need one more
for my friend.

43
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,649
Now, make her an Indian.

44
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,986
No, not with a turban.
You know, a squaw.

45
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,71
Yeah.

46
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,990
It'll be the Walden hotel.

47
00:06:49,74 --> 00:06:50,866
That's 3rd, near Broadway.

48
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:54,412
And you tell them to ask for Polson.

49
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,997
G.P. Polson.

50
00:06:56,81 --> 00:06:58,291
Yeah. P-O-L-S-O-N.

51
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,168
Just be a couple of hours.

52
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:02,712
Right.

53
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,898
That's a fairly crummy way
to start a morning.

54
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,734
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.

55
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,402
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

56
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:28,779
Maybe you don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

57
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,450
Jack, when you start with that attitude,
it's like I don't even know who you are.

58
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,37
What do you want to know?
And what difference does it make?

59
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,997
I make you feel good,
you make me feel good.

60
00:07:38,81 --> 00:07:40,374
Now, what the hell more do you want
from a guy?

61
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,543
I wish you'd stop trying
to make me mad.

62
00:07:43,03 --> 00:07:45,755
I don't have time for this.
I got to go to work.

63
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,731
You really are hopeless.

64
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,901
That's what I always say.

65
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,153
Call me later.

66
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:10,655
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

67
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,157
Good. Thanks for the coffee.

68
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,492
Okay.

69
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,327
- Oh, hey, Jack.
- Yeah.

70
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,536
Here, take this.

71
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:20,206
It's cold as hell out these mornings,
and you know what the man said.

72
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,290
No.

73
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,711
"The coldest winter I ever spent was
a summer I spent in San Francisco."

74
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,150
No, we ain't going by the store again.

75
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,403
I told you a million fucking times,
we start slow, we save a little bit.

76
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:34,613
- We go with that way.
- But I liked that carpet we saw.

77
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,73
We can't afford it.

78
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,284
Don't remind me.
I know we can't afford it.

79
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm just saying I liked it.

80
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,245
You don't have to get crabby about it.

81
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,914
What do you want me to do?
Go out and steal for the money?

82
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,751
I hated the color anyway.
The color sucked.

83
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,211
Wait.

84
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,383
- Surprise, Luther.
- What do you want?

85
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,886
- I thought you were locked up.
- I want the money, asshole.

86
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,679
What do you think?
The money that Reggie hid.

87
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,389
I don't know what you're talking about.

88
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,558
Want that Indian to snap her neck?

89
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:05,686
Instead of worrying about Reggie,
you better start worrying about me.

90
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,730
Don't give me this. We were partners!

91
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,23
Go ahead, Billy. Break it.

92
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:11,275
No! Don't hurt her.

93
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,402
- I can get you the money.
- When?

94
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,988
I can't get it till Monday. Honest.

95
00:10:16,72 --> 00:10:17,156
Little chickenshit...

96
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,575
Honest! The place we got it stashed
doesn't open till Monday.

97
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,411
I can't get it till then.
Monday morning. That's when it opens.

98
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,372
After that, I'll get the money right to you.

99
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,378
I always liked you, Luther.

100
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,757
You were always a lot of fun
to hang out with.

101
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,884
We're gonna keep her.

102
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,636
Come on. You can trust me.

103
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,721
And if you mess with us,

104
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:44,99
I'll put holes in her
you never even thought of.

105
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,518
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

106
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:47,436
Ganz, please.

107
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,21
Don't fuck up.

108
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,231
Ganz!

109
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,816
- Luther!
- Rosie!

110
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,761
Hey, Algren, need any backup?

111
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,97
No, Jack, please.
You make me nervous.

112
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,306
You know that.

113
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,684
Your wife makes you nervous, not me.

114
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,769
The radio said
you guys had something on.

115
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,854
Not much, Jack.

116
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,523
A salesman named Polson
had his credit cards lifted.

117
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:35,192
One of Polson's cards
rented that green coupe over there.

118
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,945
Not much for a big guy like you, Cates.

119
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,30
Oh, it's just a laugher, huh, Van?

120
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,699
It's five-and-dime, Jack.

121
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,534
Polson said a kid
with a switchblade mugged him

122
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:45,286
and took off on a motorcycle.

123
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,38
Well, you guys are experts
at taking knives away from teenagers.

124
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,833
Yeah, we are, so keep out of it.
We don't need any big artillery.

125
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,129
Well, I'm just trying to help out, Van.
I love to watch pros work.

126
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:57,47
I don't need your help, Cates.

127
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:59,550
Hey, Jack, you want to come in,
that's fine.

128
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,177
You stake out the lobby.
How's the car running?

129
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,13
Great. How's the wife?

130
00:12:04,97 --> 00:12:05,681
Mean as a snake.

131
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,475
Nice paint job.

132
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:22,406
- Hello. We're looking...
- You guys were in last week.

133
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,575
You better ask around.
I'm not supposed to be hassled.

134
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:25,784
I got friends.

135
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,578
Park your tongue for a second,
sweet pants.

136
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,787
We just want to search a room.

137
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:30,623
- Not unless you got a warrant, babyface.
- Actually...

138
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,124
Hey, maybe you should've been
a lawyer

139
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,919
instead of a dumb skirt working behind
a cash register, huh?

140
00:12:35,03 --> 00:12:36,462
Come on, what the shit is this?

141
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:37,630
- Jack, don't do that.
- Don't worry about that, now.

142
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:39,798
We're looking for a man
by the name of Polson.

143
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,133
"Polson. Room 27."

144
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:43,135
Okay, big deal. Get it over with.

145
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,470
Is he alone?

146
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,56
A couple girls went up to visit him
about an hour ago.

147
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
Thank you.

148
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,391
You guys be careful.

149
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,477
Yeah, and like we said,
you stake out the lobby.

150
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:53,228
All right, Vinnie.

151
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:57,107
- I'll let you handle it, Al.
- Thank you.

152
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:35,854
Hey, this isn't exactly
my goddamn life's ambition, you know.

153
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,564
It's like a part-time thing.

154
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,775
I'm trying to get the money together
to send for my kid.

155
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:42,236
He's been staying with his granny.

156
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,489
You don't want to hear
that personal crap anyway.

157
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,616
Are you listening to me?

158
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:53,914
Hey.

159
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,417
Did you hear a goddamn word I said?

160
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,882
So...

161
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,343
How much money you got left?

162
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,651
Hi, Liz. How you doing? It's me.

163
00:14:23,69 --> 00:14:24,278
What's going on?

164
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,198
Nothing. Just a couple of cops.
What else is new?

165
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,950
How was your date?

166
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,785
You're kidding.

167
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,663
Liz, you gotta stop sitting still
for that kind of shit.

168
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,666
Yeah. Put him in his place.

169
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,484
You're gonna ask who it is. All right?

170
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,114
Ask.

171
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,75
- Who is it?
- Police. Open up.

172
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:12,910
What do you want?

173
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,995
Police business. Open up right now!

174
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,747
Keep on stalling.

175
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,124
Hang on a second.
I gotta put something on.

176
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,459
Hold on.

177
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:36,350
You listen.
When I tell you to jump, you jump.

178
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,28
Call for help now!

179
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,785
Operator!

180
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:49,256
Jack. There are two of them, Jack!

181
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,102
Stay here. Stay down.
Check out the lobby.

182
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,105
It's an emergency!
They're fighting upstairs!

183
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,524
Operator, did you get through
to the police?

184
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,610
Put down that goddamn phone, lady.

185
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,361
You drop the phone!

186
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,697
- Drop that phone!
- Don't hurt me, please!

187
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,115
Oh, my God!

188
00:17:21,39 --> 00:17:22,706
Please, let me go!

189
00:17:24,00 --> 00:17:25,584
Please, let me go.

190
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,670
Billy, bring her out.

191
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,547
He ain't gonna shoot.

192
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,469
Come on!

193
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:36,762
No! No!

194
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,734
Shut up!

195
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,446
No!

196
00:17:55,73 --> 00:17:56,448
Oh, my God!

197
00:18:09,03 --> 00:18:10,128
No!

198
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:19,471
You! Toss me that goddamn piece,
and he won't waste him.

199
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:23,16
Don't do it, Jack.
Don't give him the gun.

200
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,520
God damn it, Jack! Don't you do it!

201
00:18:32,68 --> 00:18:33,860
Don't do that for me.

202
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,51
Get the car.

203
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:34,671
Nice gun.

204
00:20:07,80 --> 00:20:09,664
- What happened?
- Just read the fucking report!

205
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,292
Two cops get blown away
by a credit card booster?

206
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,252
- That don't figure.
- No shit.

207
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,837
Yeah, and those guys were good cops.

208
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,06
Hell, yes.
They were good cops who fucked up.

209
00:20:18,91 --> 00:20:19,299
They just got careless, that's all.

210
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,675
Yeah, that's what you say, Cates.

211
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,804
- Yeah, that's what I say!
- That's what you always say.

212
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,56
The way you tell it,
we're always the ones that fuck up.

213
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,516
The truth hurts, don't it, buddy?

214
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,643
- Yeah, but, Jack, it don't figure.
- It don't figure.

215
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,354
- Can I borrow a piece?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see what I can do.

216
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,981
When somebody steals your gun,
you're supposed to file a report.

217
00:20:35,66 --> 00:20:36,525
Just don't give me a bunch of crap.

218
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,986
Well, I guess when two cops die
because you fucked up...

219
00:20:40,71 --> 00:20:42,447
Jesus! Cool down! Knock it off!
Knock it off!

220
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,450
It's not gonna bring them back!
You know better!

221
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,36
Look, Cates,
I want to see you right away.

222
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,871
We got a lot to talk about!

223
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:51,873
God damn it, do you read me, Cates?

224
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,875
Yeah, I hear you. Your voice carries.

225
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,419
Five minutes.

226
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,216
- Ruth!
- They're still wet.

227
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,468
A lot of people getting shot
with.44s lately.

228
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,804
Last year,
it was Saturday night specials.

229
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,431
Now it's the heavy stuff.

230
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,266
People must be getting madder
about something.

231
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,559
You're an accessory to Murder One,

232
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,269
so you're gonna have to do
a whole lot better

233
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:14,729
- than what you've got down here, honey.
- Give me a break, huh?

234
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,106
- Cates!
- Yeah!

235
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,775
Got a print from the hotel room, the
guy's real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz.

236
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,653
He headed from back east, but he
worked out here a few years back.

237
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:22,779
Armed robbery.

238
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,616
Broke out of prison a couple of days ago
and capped a couple of the guards.

239
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,618
A real animal. Wait till you see this.

240
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,328
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,956
Did he give you a return match?

242
00:21:33,40 --> 00:21:34,124
He wasn't interested.

243
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,792
Maybe he didn't
like the merchandise, huh?

244
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,961
- Fuck you.
- I'll take a rain check on that, huh?

245
00:21:38,45 --> 00:21:39,921
- This'll interest you, Jack.
- Yeah, what do you got?

246
00:21:40,06 --> 00:21:41,298
We got something from your gun,

247
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:42,799
and this is from the first weapon
Ganz used.

248
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,967
Wait a minute. I don't get this.

249
00:21:44,51 --> 00:21:47,12
Here. It's a perfect match from
the markings from the first gun he used.

250
00:21:47,96 --> 00:21:49,973
But it's not from the Walden hotel.
Fired six hours earlier,

251
00:21:50,57 --> 00:21:51,808
point blank range,
right between the eyes.

252
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,477
Found him on a park bench.

253
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:56,354
You know, there are some
very bad people out there in the world.

254
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,606
Yeah, look at it this way, Ruth.

255
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,108
If there weren't,
what the hell would we have to do, huh?

256
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,736
So anyway, I got there.
He took me down.

257
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,112
He started watching television,

258
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,990
and then you sensational people
started banging on the door.

259
00:22:07,74 --> 00:22:08,325
That's it.

260
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,785
Except that I think he's gonna
give you guys a hard time.

261
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,496
What makes you think so?

262
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,290
I just think he likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid.

263
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:17,209
- Jack, check it out.
- What do you got?

264
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:19,169
The stuff from his hotel.
Every last bit of it.

265
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,422
- The big guy's room was empty.
- All right, let's go through it.

266
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:29,346
A speedloader.
This guy's got a.44 like yours, Jack.

267
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,514
Jesus.

268
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:32,682
This cat is serious about his artillery.

269
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,976
- Here's the files.
- Oh, thanks.

270
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,20
Billy Bear, huh?

271
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeah, big Indian from the East Bay.

272
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:39,940
Worked with Ganz a few years back,

273
00:22:40,24 --> 00:22:41,358
and he sprung him from the road gang.

274
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:43,527
- Who's this guy?
- Wong. Henry Wong.

275
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:44,861
He was in on the same job.

276
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,239
Kehoe, come here. Come here.
I want to show you something.

277
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:50,534
Come here. Look at this. Look at this.

278
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,120
Now, tell me. The same guy.

279
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:55,956
Hey, Dick fucking Tracy.

280
00:22:56,40 --> 00:22:58,41
All right, I'm gonna want to talk to
one of these guys.

281
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,877
- Any of them walking around?
- One of the gang's still in the slam.

282
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,337
Good. Good.

283
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,799
- Get in here, Cates!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

284
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:11,638
Speedloader. Kehoe!

285
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,519
I want to be left alone on this one.
Al was killed with my gun.

286
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:21,273
Jack, there's an official
department policy about cop killings.

287
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,608
Now, cop killers represent
a special priority,

288
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,111
because any man crazy enough
to kill a cop

289
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:28,29
is a greater threat
to an unarmed civilian.

290
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:29,239
- Right.
- In other words,

291
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:31,616
we can't seem like
we're in the revenge business.

292
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,577
And we all know
the truth's a little different.

293
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,786
Yeah?

294
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,747
Anything's bothering you
besides losing your gun?

295
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:39,749
Yeah, it bothers me
when cops get killed.

296
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,334
I don't like that.

297
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,461
Then you might be
a little more of a team player

298
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:45,380
and a little less of a hot dog on this one.

299
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:48,300
Hot dogging's been
working real well so far.

300
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:49,634
Besides, I got a lead.

301
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,178
Okay. You got to do things
your own way?

302
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:53,388
Fine.

303
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:55,932
Now, you nail this guy
and make us all look good,

304
00:23:56,17 --> 00:23:57,392
but you better watch your ass,

305
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,477
because everybody's watching
on this one.

306
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:03,23
If you screw up, I can promise you,
you're going down.

307
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:07,694
Boy, you know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude, boss.

308
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,226
Those days are over

309
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:44,189
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

310
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,232
I'm here to see Reggie Hammond.

311
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,486
- He's in 18. You want company?
- No, thank you.

312
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,197
You don't have to put on the red light

313
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,32
Those days are over

314
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:58,78
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

315
00:24:58,621 --> 00:24:59,996
Roxanne

316
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:05,251
You don't have to put on the red light

317
00:25:07,88 --> 00:25:09,297
Walk the streets for money

318
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,718
You don't even care
if it's wrong or if it's right

319
00:25:14,11 --> 00:25:16,96
Roxanne

320
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:20,58
You don't have to work for money...

321
00:25:20,142 --> 00:25:21,309
Is that Hammond?

322
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,229
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

323
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:25,313
Hammond!

324
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,232
Put on the red light

325
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:30,26
Roxanne, put on the red light

326
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,70
Roxanne, put on the...

327
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:33,446
Hammond!

328
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,36
- You got a name, cop?
- Let's try Cates.

329
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,373
Come on, I want to talk to you in private.

330
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,334
Look, Hammond, I know all about you.

331
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,795
You're single,
you got no fixed address, no relatives.

332
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,547
One previous conviction,
armed robbery.

333
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:51,965
Six months to go on
a three-year sentence.

334
00:25:52,49 --> 00:25:54,175
- Is that right?
- So what, man?

335
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,678
- You gonna write my life story?
- Not likely, Reggie.

336
00:25:58,13 --> 00:26:00,14
Maybe I just need a little help, huh?

337
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:04,227
That's Henry Wong,
an old friend of mine.

338
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,104
- He's looked better.
- That's right.

339
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,313
Yeah, well, look, man,

340
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,607
I've been in this goddamn cell
for two and a half years

341
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,317
and I'm getting out
in six months, all right?

342
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,153
I ain't gonna do nothing
to fuck myself up.

343
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:15,655
But if you came here
to find out something from me,

344
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,865
you come to the wrong person,

345
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,992
'cause I don't fuck
my old friends over, man.

346
00:26:19,76 --> 00:26:20,577
That's too bad, Reggie.

347
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,37
I thought maybe you were a smart boy.

348
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:27,00
But I guess if you were real smart,
you wouldn't be a convict.

349
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,211
Yeah, I guess a second-rater like you
would be no help

350
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:32,922
- with a hard case like Ganz.
- Ganz?

351
00:26:33,07 --> 00:26:34,883
- Right.
- Man, Ganz is in jail.

352
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,718
He's gonna be there
two years after I get out.

353
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:39,137
Didn't work out that way, Reggie.
A big Indian busted him out.

354
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:41,264
They capped two guards
on a road gang.

355
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:42,849
See you later.

356
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,852
- Yo, Cates.
- Yeah?

357
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:49,439
I can help you get Ganz,
but you gotta get me out of here first.

358
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:50,815
You're crazy.

359
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,443
I'm serious. I can help you get him,
but I gotta be on the street.

360
00:26:53,527 --> 00:26:55,487
What's the big deal being on the street?

361
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:57,447
Let's just say I got a lot to protect,
all right?

362
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,32
I want Ganz as bad as you.

363
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,534
- Neither one of us ain't got no time.
- Bullshit!

364
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,620
No, that's serious shit!

365
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:05,663
You want Ganz, get me out of here.

366
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:09,292
I'll think about it, Reggie.

367
00:27:10,44 --> 00:27:11,211
Cates.

368
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,923
Cates!
You gotta get me out of here, man!

369
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,550
Get me out of here, Cates!

370
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,803
Cates!

371
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,765
Fuck you!

372
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:35,735
Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

373
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,405
- You gonna use your own name?
- Shit, no.

374
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:46,955
Jack, if all this comes down,
you don't know me.

375
00:27:47,39 --> 00:27:49,707
I'm not gonna burn for you.
And I'll tell you something else.

376
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:53,02
If it all comes down,
your ass is new-mown grass.

377
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,630
All right. You got him for 48 hours.

378
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:57,90
Sure thing.

379
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,593
You know, you got a big career
as a forger if you decide to go that way.

380
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,970
Thank you, Bob.

381
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:03,763
I'll ring security.

382
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:16,359
Wouldn't talk down to you

383
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:17,944
Hammond.

384
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,363
Okay, send him through.

385
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:23,241
- You gotta sign for him.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

386
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,451
- He's all yours.
- All right.

387
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,371
See how you needed me a little more
than you thought, huh, Mr. Cates?

388
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,164
I decided you're
as good a chance as I got.

389
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,375
That shows you how desperate I am.

390
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,544
This prison give out $400 suits?

391
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:37,05
$957, and I wore this shit in.

392
00:28:37,89 --> 00:28:39,215
We're after a killer,
not a bunch of hookers.

393
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,508
Yeah, well, I got a reputation

394
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,135
for looking real nice
with the ladies, man.

395
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,846
Maybe when we get out,
I can take you to a couple of spots,

396
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,307
we can get you dressed up,
and we can go on a little pussy hunt.

397
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:49,642
I don't want to hear your jive.

398
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:51,936
Already got that department
taken care of.

399
00:28:52,21 --> 00:28:53,855
- You got a lady, Cates?
- Yeah.

400
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:56,232
You know, the generosity of women
never ceases to amaze me.

401
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,400
You know that?

402
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:01,195
Hey, don't even try this shit, man.
I don't work like this. No deal.

403
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,240
Listen, we ain't got no deal.
I own your ass!

404
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,76
Ain't no goddamn way
to start a partnership.

405
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,411
Now, get this.

406
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:11,39
We ain't partners, we ain't brothers,
and we ain't friends!

407
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:12,749
I'm putting you down
and keeping you down

408
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,584
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

409
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:18,504
And if Ganz gets away,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me!

410
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:22,175
I'm already sorry.

411
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,437
- This your car, man?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,564
Look like you bought it off
one of the brothers.

413
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,359
All right, I did my part and I got you out,
so now you do yours.

414
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,443
Where we going?

415
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:41,778
We gotta go see a guy named Luther.

416
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:42,987
Ganz will be going to see him soon.

417
00:29:43,72 --> 00:29:44,280
We ain't got that much time, though.

418
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,75
- Is Luther part of the gang?
- What gang you talking about, Jack?

419
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:48,952
Hey, I can read a police file, shithead.

420
00:29:49,36 --> 00:29:50,411
Quit calling me Jack.

421
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,914
It's just an expression, all right?
I don't mean nothing by it.

422
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,83
I don't give a damn.
It happens to be my name.

423
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,417
What the hell you complaining for?

424
00:29:56,502 --> 00:30:00,129
- At least nobody calling you shithead.
- I may call you worse than that.

425
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:31,494
Right up there, man,
and don't knock on the door.

426
00:30:31,578 --> 00:30:33,37
He ain't expecting no company.

427
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,831
Luther ain't very stable, man.

428
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:37,667
And I don't want you getting shot
before you get a chance to help me.

429
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,752
Oh, I'm helping you, huh?

430
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,547
Slow down. Right there, 232.

431
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,343
What's the chances he's packed?

432
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,678
Been a while since I worked with him.

433
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:50,680
I'd say chances are
probably about 100%.

434
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:52,348
You better leave me a gun
or something, man.

435
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,226
I ain't sitting out here without no gun.

436
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,645
Sure thing, asshole.

437
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,856
Now, you just hang on.

438
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:05,570
Hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

439
00:31:57,873 --> 00:31:58,998
What's happening, Luther?

440
00:31:59,83 --> 00:32:00,958
I'm sorry about the door, man.
Did that hurt?

441
00:32:01,43 --> 00:32:04,170
It looked real painful
when you slammed into it.

442
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,883
Luther, I'm talking to you.
Luther. Luther!

443
00:32:09,93 --> 00:32:11,844
Hammond! Drop that goddamn gun!

444
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,347
Hey, man, that's a dangerous game
you're playing, man.

445
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:15,807
Don't point that gun at me, all right?

446
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,142
Don't point your goddamn gun at me,
all right?

447
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,520
Hand me that gun or you're dead.

448
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,916
I'm looking for Ganz. Where is he?

449
00:32:42,00 --> 00:32:44,335
Ganz? Haven't seen him for years.

450
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:46,03
That's the truth.

451
00:32:46,88 --> 00:32:47,922
Look, asshole,
you just took a shot at me.

452
00:32:48,06 --> 00:32:50,216
I think you do know where Ganz is.

453
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,885
Who gives a fuck what you think?

454
00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:00,977
Yo, Luther, man,
you better tell this boy something.

455
00:33:01,61 --> 00:33:03,646
He's having a ball with this car door.

456
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,902
Luther! Are you angry with me?

457
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:13,156
I don't know what
you're smiling at, watermelon.

458
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,867
Your big move just turned out to be shit.

459
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,994
All right, all right, all right!

460
00:33:18,78 --> 00:33:20,997
Yeah, if I defend myself,
I'm resisting arrest, right?

461
00:33:21,81 --> 00:33:23,374
Officer, I want to make
a citizen's arrest!

462
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,667
Shut up!

463
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:26,169
What you got here, Jack?

464
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,671
I got a punk here
carrying a concealed weapon...

465
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,173
All you cops are faggots!

466
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,924
Resisting arrest.

467
00:33:32,92 --> 00:33:34,510
I'll think up some more,
file a report tomorrow.

468
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:37,346
- I bet you will.
- Yeah, I will. Get him out of here.

469
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,473
Man, give me a 9:00 wake-up call.

470
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:40,641
Good-bye, Luther!

471
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,685
I don't need a friend like you, Reggie!

472
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:45,730
When do I get my phone call?
Let me get my lawyer here!

473
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:47,857
You're gonna be in trouble!

474
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:49,525
Stay right here.

475
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:53,279
- Okay?
- Get your hands off me!

476
00:33:55,449 --> 00:33:59,452
I'm not gonna take this from you.
That's no way to treat a lady.

477
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:04,81
No, you're not.

478
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:08,753
Excuse me, ladies,

479
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,880
you seem to be
in some need of assistance.

480
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:12,48
We've got enough problems.

481
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:13,382
We don't need some tight-assed,

482
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,885
court-appointed lawyer
trying to bullshit us.

483
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,887
Sweetheart, I'm not here to bullshit you.

484
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,555
I don't know whether or not
you ladies know,

485
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,806
but the city's coming down on people

486
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,184
involved with
unlawful carnal knowledge.

487
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:26,354
Hello?

488
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:29,357
This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

489
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:32,193
Oh, just one.

490
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:34,612
Some lady called, says
she's a little hotheaded sometimes,

491
00:34:34,696 --> 00:34:37,156
but she still wants
her occasional roommate.

492
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:40,368
She says she'd like to talk it over
tonight after she gets off work,

493
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,661
if it's humanly possible.

494
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:43,371
Look, Elaine, I...

495
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,40
I've got some stuff to do tonight.

496
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:48,459
I'm not going to be able to come by.
I don't know when I can.

497
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,585
Come on, Jack.

498
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,754
You're making me work
too goddamn hard at this!

499
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:52,922
Listen, god damn it.

500
00:34:53,06 --> 00:34:55,49
If you think I'm happy about it,
you're nuts!

501
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:56,759
I just got a few things to take care of.

502
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:58,803
This is not the way
people who care about each other

503
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,805
are supposed to behave!

504
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:05,685
Shit!

505
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:08,145
I'm trying to say
you're both going to do a little time,

506
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,22
about 30 days each.

507
00:35:10,524 --> 00:35:12,984
Unless, of course,
we talk some real business.

508
00:35:13,68 --> 00:35:15,945
So where do you want to do it, honey?
Want to hop up on the counter?

509
00:35:16,29 --> 00:35:18,281
No. We can go in this room over here,
next to the bathroom.

510
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:19,448
- Give me a break.
- I'm dead serious.

511
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:20,783
Come on, we're on the move. Let's go!

512
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,952
Man, you know how close I was
to getting some trim just now,

513
00:35:23,36 --> 00:35:24,36
and you fucked it up?

514
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,538
Hey, well, my ass bleeds for you.

515
00:35:25,622 --> 00:35:27,915
I didn't get you out
so you could go on a trim hunt.

516
00:35:28,00 --> 00:35:29,292
Stop moaning.

517
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:31,585
You know, speaking of moaning,
my stomach is starting to growl.

518
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,462
- We better go get something to eat.
- We eat when I say we eat.

519
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:36,132
Hey, now, that's bullshit.
That's the last straw, all right?

520
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:37,383
I want some food now.

521
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:39,635
If you don't like it,
you take me back to the penitentiary

522
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,470
and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye,
all right?

523
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:42,638
You took me out here,

524
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,682
you've been treating me like shit
since we first left,

525
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:46,225
and I want some food in a nice place,

526
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,311
in a nice atmosphere,
with some good people.

527
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,271
Okay, hold it. I'm hungry.

528
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:53,482
Let's go get something to eat.
I know a place, all right?

529
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:54,900
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

530
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:57,611
I want some mandolins
and some violins.

531
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,72
Yeah!

532
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,534
There's your goddamn dinner.

533
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,77
Come on.

534
00:36:10,83 --> 00:36:12,01
Who was that you called
back on the phone, Jack?

535
00:36:12,85 --> 00:36:14,295
None of your goddamn business.

536
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,881
Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut.

537
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:18,341
Come on, man, I think it was your lady.

538
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:19,717
Why don't you tell me
something about her?

539
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,385
What's her problem, besides you?

540
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,930
She got the same problem
as half the goddamn population.

541
00:36:25,15 --> 00:36:27,558
Can't get a job she's trained for,
and it pisses her off.

542
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:30,478
She's bitching all the time.
What the fuck do you care?

543
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:32,188
Hey, man, I'm in jail, remember that?

544
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:34,690
I'm surrounded by guys
wearing blue suits 24 hours a day.

545
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,900
I ain't built for that shit.

546
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:39,570
Yeah? The clothes you wear,
you look like you'd love it.

547
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:43,157
All right, where to, convict?

548
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:45,743
Mission District, catch us an Indian.

549
00:37:07,99 --> 00:37:08,724
Yo, man,
tell me about this girlfriend of yours.

550
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,101
When was the last time
you got with her?

551
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:11,769
I don't give out details.

552
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:13,938
Come on, man.
I've been in prison for three years.

553
00:37:14,22 --> 00:37:15,398
I'm tired of hearing lies about pussy.

554
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:16,982
Man, when was it, last week,
the week before?

555
00:37:17,67 --> 00:37:18,192
Last night.

556
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:19,402
- Really?
- Yeah.

557
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:21,153
- Was it fun?
- Yeah.

558
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,991
Christ. Then in the morning,
we got in a fucking argument.

559
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:28,869
At least you took care of business first,
right, Jack?

560
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:29,995
Right.

561
00:37:30,80 --> 00:37:33,124
Yo, man, does she have,
like, big, giant titties?

562
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:37,86
I can see this is gonna be a long
fucking night, convict.

563
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,99
Okay, what's the deal?

564
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:51,183
It's a long shot,

565
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,394
but Billy used to work at
this club over here as a bartender.

566
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:55,604
I heard him talk about it before.

567
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:56,772
This neighborhood,

568
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,524
they're gonna make me for a cop
right away.

569
00:37:58,608 --> 00:38:01,527
All right, you just back me up.
Pretend like you got a piece, all right?

570
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:02,778
What the fuck I want to do that for?

571
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,71
They may beat the shit out of me,

572
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,532
but I guarantee you,
they'll cut your black ass right up.

573
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:08,284
Oh, so you a bad-ass?

574
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:11,704
You know, it's amazing how far
a gun and a badge will take some guys.

575
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,540
Bullshit! Attitude and experience
is what gets you through.

576
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:15,875
Come on.

577
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:22,89
I'm telling you, man,
I've been in places like this before.

578
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,841
When white cops came to fuck with me
and my friends,

579
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:25,718
only thing that stopped us
from kicking their ass,

580
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:26,802
they had guns and badges.

581
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,513
Takes years of experience
to handle a joint like this.

582
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,223
You want to bet?

583
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:32,516
I got two problems.

584
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,268
Number one,
I ain't playing fucking games.

585
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:36,562
Number two,
you ain't got nothing to bet with.

586
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,731
Look, if we go in there
and get a phone number

587
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,983
or Ganz or a dead Indian,
anything that helps us out,

588
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,402
turn your back for a half-hour
and let me go get some pussy.

589
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,487
What for?

590
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:47,823
Any man talks about women like you
can't get it up anyhow.

591
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,325
I been in prison for three years.

592
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:51,911
My dick gets hard if the wind blows.

593
00:38:52,412 --> 00:38:54,371
All right. You got a bet.

594
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:58,00
But when you lose, you tell me the truth.

595
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,85
What the fuck you talking about?

596
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,505
Ganz didn't get out for nothing.
What's he after?

597
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:04,215
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

598
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,259
- I want to nail Ganz, just like you.
- Fuck you! Bet's off.

599
00:39:08,53 --> 00:39:09,929
All right, Cates, look.

600
00:39:12,98 --> 00:39:15,476
If I lose, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

601
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:20,397
All right, you got a deal.
Hell, I'm gonna enjoy this.

602
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,274
I'm gonna even give you my badge.

603
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,402
You said bullshit and experience
is all it takes, right?

604
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:26,529
Right.

605
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,657
Come on in and experience
some of my bullshit.

606
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,284
All right. Let's see it.

607
00:40:11,658 --> 00:40:13,784
Not a very popular place
with the brothers.

608
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:17,162
It's my kind of place.
I always liked country boys.

609
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:20,666
They're sure as hell gonna like you.

610
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,18
Howdy.

611
00:40:58,38 --> 00:41:00,331
- How do.
- Yeah?

612
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:04,251
I'd like something to drink,
preferably some vodka.

613
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:07,379
Maybe you'd best have a Black Russian.

614
00:41:10,884 --> 00:41:13,927
Black Russian! You hear what he said?
Black Russian.

615
00:41:14,12 --> 00:41:15,804
That's a funny joke. I get it.

616
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,973
I'm black. Now, that's funny!

617
00:41:18,58 --> 00:41:19,933
No. I'd just rather have plain old vodka.

618
00:41:20,18 --> 00:41:21,393
That'd be nice.

619
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,312
You know,
long as we're standing here talking

620
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:26,523
and we're all friendly,
I'm looking for a good old boy

621
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:27,900
by the name of Billy Bear.

622
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,402
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me find him.

623
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,737
Never heard of him.

624
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:35,491
Never heard of him before.
Never heard of Billy Bear, huh?

625
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:39,370
Looky here!

626
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,167
You fucking heard of him now, man?

627
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:47,86
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

628
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:50,89
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind if
I looked around for a little while then.

629
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,425
- I don't give a shit what you do!
- Good.

630
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:10,234
Never seen so many backwards-ass
country fucks in my life.

631
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,613
It makes me sick just to be in here.
You boys look like regulars.

632
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:16,281
I'm looking for a guy named Billy Bear.

633
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,366
You know where I could find him?

634
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,619
This is our place. I don't give a shit
what the fuck your badge says, nigger.

635
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,706
You're a big, tough country faggot,
ain't you?

636
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,628
You out of your fucking mind, man?
Get up against that fucking pole!

637
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,214
Think I'm playing
a goddamn game, man?

638
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:34,550
You out of your fucking mind?

639
00:42:36,94 --> 00:42:38,137
I'm gonna say it one more time, okay?

640
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:39,388
This is a police matter,

641
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:42,57
and I'm looking for
an Indian named Billy Bear.

642
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,436
I know everybody in here
wants to cooperate with me.

643
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,900
Hey, that's not even necessary,
all right, man?

644
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:54,153
I got this situation in hand.

645
00:42:55,822 --> 00:42:59,366
Some of us citizens are
behind you all the way, officer.

646
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:04,246
- What's your fucking problem?
- I'm on parole.

647
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,415
- That's why you're running away?
- Yeah.

648
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:08,667
Sit your country ass down, man.

649
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,505
All right, listen up!

650
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:17,676
I don't like white people!
I hate rednecks!

651
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:22,556
You people are rednecks.
That means I'm enjoying this shit.

652
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:28,437
You loaded here.
Where the fuck did you get this?

653
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:30,773
- Tax refund.
- That's bullshit.

654
00:43:30,857 --> 00:43:33,567
You're too fucking stupid to have a job.

655
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:38,739
You don't like that?
You don't like that shit?

656
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:40,73
You hate that shit, right?

657
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,77
- What the hell kind of cop are you?
- You know what I am?

658
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:47,623
I'm your worst fucking nightmare, man.
I'm a nigger with a badge.

659
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:51,168
That mean I got permission to kick
your fucking ass whenever I feel like it.

660
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,966
All right, listen up, man.

661
00:43:58,51 --> 00:44:00,969
One of them's underage,
another one attacked a police officer,

662
00:44:01,54 --> 00:44:03,138
and I still ain't found
what I'm looking for yet.

663
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,892
Well, look, I think you're on your way
to being out of business, all right?

664
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:08,227
Let's see

665
00:44:09,20 --> 00:44:10,187
what we can fuck with next.

666
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:13,649
Hey, man! All right! Okay! Now, listen.

667
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,401
The Indian hangs out with a chick
who lives up the block.

668
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:18,946
Just head up the alley, across
the street, where Chinatown starts,

669
00:44:19,30 --> 00:44:20,489
she lives on top of the jewelry store.

670
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:22,199
I didn't ask you shit about his girl, man.

671
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:23,826
Come on, give me a break, will you?

672
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,453
You're gonna have to settle for
her place 'cause it's all I know.

673
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,373
I'm telling you. I'm giving you all I know!

674
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:34,86
Well, look, hoss.

675
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,922
You start running
a respectable business,

676
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,716
and I won't have to come in here
and hassle you every night.

677
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:41,426
Know what I mean?

678
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,975
And I want the rest of you cowboys
to know something.

679
00:44:48,59 --> 00:44:50,269
There's a new sheriff in town.

680
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:56,942
And his name is Reggie Hammond.

681
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,611
Y'all be cool. Right on!

682
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:24,136
- Let's go, man.
- I think you got something for me.

683
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,555
What you talking about?

684
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,268
Why don't you give me
that gun you took off the redneck?

685
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,314
- Oh, you saw that!
- Yeah.

686
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:38,25
Here you go.

687
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:42,321
While you're at it,
why don't you give me the switchblade?

688
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,324
You saw that, too, huh?
You don't miss nothing, Jack.

689
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:48,785
It was real smooth
how I took it from him, right?

690
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,288
Listen, man,
you owe me a piece of ass, right?

691
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:54,333
Why don't you just give me that gun?
We'll call it even.

692
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:57,02
You did a good job, Reggie.

693
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,964
I guess you deserve a reward. Here.

694
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,264
Fucking bastard.

695
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:11,850
That I am.

696
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,773
Let's go get us an Indian down the alley.

697
00:46:32,205 --> 00:46:34,539
I don't think nobody's home, man.

698
00:46:36,42 --> 00:46:38,01
Let's check around back.

699
00:46:41,47 --> 00:46:42,172
Shit!

700
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:48,53
I hope we have as much fun as we had
in that hillbilly bar back there, man.

701
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:50,681
Don't bust your arm
patting yourself on the back, convict.

702
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,101
You see the way I handled those boys?
I tell you. I'm on a roll.

703
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:56,311
If we see Billy in here,
you let me take care of him, all right?

704
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,231
Why don't you get a megaphone
and announce we're coming?

705
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:02,609
You make more goddamn noise
than a busted chain saw.

706
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:10,242
What the hell they watching?

707
00:47:12,245 --> 00:47:13,704
I don't know.

708
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,40
- Yeah, well, TV has changed.
- Yeah.

709
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,210
Look at this!

710
00:47:21,587 --> 00:47:25,90
- There. That must be Billy's girlfriend.
- Yeah. Come on.

711
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:32,97
- Police! Nobody move!
- Stay where you are!

712
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,352
Okay, you'd just better drop it,
or he's gonna get another one.

713
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,354
Man, listen to her.
The girl thinks she's Babe Ruth.

714
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,190
I said police!
Now put the goddamn gun down!

715
00:47:42,275 --> 00:47:45,235
Don't give me that police shit.
You drop it.

716
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,613
Okay, look. Don't shoot.

717
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,616
I'm just gonna reach for my badge.

718
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,208
I don't like this bullshit.
I've seen fake badges before.

719
00:48:00,293 --> 00:48:02,335
Hey, sweetheart,
this guy got a real itchy trigger finger,

720
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,503
and he's a nervous cop.

721
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:05,380
You better listen to him,
or you'll get your brains blown out!

722
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,425
Shut up! I'm the calm type.

723
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:11,386
Now, I know you don't want me
to shoot you,

724
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,430
and I know you don't want to shoot me.

725
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:16,141
So come on, just hand me over the gun.

726
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:24,232
You assholes better be real.

727
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:27,69
Hey, let's just wait a minute here.
Let's see your badge.

728
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:28,528
I ain't got no goddamn badge.

729
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:30,405
I ought to hit you in your head
with this thing.

730
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,33
- Hey! Will you call the cops?
- Right.

731
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:35,285
Put that goddamn phone down!

732
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:39,289
If you don't answer some questions,
I'm gonna haul both your asses in!

733
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:40,665
Shit.

734
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:42,667
All right.

735
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:46,713
Which one of you sees Billy Bear?

736
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:49,716
Hey, look,
it's none of your business, cop.

737
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:53,261
The son of a bitch isn't here,
and he isn't coming back.

738
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:55,597
You guys can do better than that.
How about you?

739
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,183
I haven't seen him for two weeks,
and I don't think I'm gonna.

740
00:48:58,267 --> 00:48:59,893
He owes me money.

741
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,354
Sounds like a real stormy romance.

742
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,356
I don't care much
what it sounds like to you, cop.

743
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,942
All I know is that I went a couple of laps
around the track with him,

744
00:49:07,26 --> 00:49:08,777
and I ended up
with the short end of the stick.

745
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:10,779
- Come on.
- No, wait a minute, man.

746
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:12,531
I've been in prison for three years.

747
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:15,117
You know, if this lady's been getting
the short end of the stick,

748
00:49:15,201 --> 00:49:18,286
maybe you'd like to go a couple laps
around the track with us.

749
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:19,621
Fuck off.

750
00:49:19,872 --> 00:49:21,123
Come on!

751
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,544
Say, if you find Billy,
tell him to stay out of my life.

752
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:28,463
I don't want any more of
his macho bullshit.

753
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:30,465
Let's go.

754
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:38,56
This sucks.

755
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:40,183
A maniac gets a hold of my gun

756
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,978
and runs all over the streets
killing people with it.

757
00:49:43,62 --> 00:49:45,981
So instead of being where I ought to be,
home in bed with my gal

758
00:49:46,65 --> 00:49:47,315
giving her the high hard one,

759
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,735
I'm out here doing this shit,
roaming around the streets

760
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,780
with an overdressed,
charcoal-colored loser like you.

761
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:56,199
Look, man, if you don't like it,
why don't you just leave?

762
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,160
I can take care of Ganz by myself,
all right?

763
00:49:58,244 --> 00:50:01,413
Yeah, don't make me laugh.
You can't take care of shit.

764
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:05,83
You've been dicking me around
since we started this turd hunt.

765
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,210
The only thing you're good for is games.

766
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:10,213
So far, what I got out of you is nothing.

767
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,174
Yeah, well, I'm real impressed
with you, too, man.

768
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:16,94
It took a real skilled cop to kick in the
bedroom door of a couple of dykes.

769
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,930
Luther knows more than he told me,
and so do you.

770
00:50:19,15 --> 00:50:21,141
Now, I want to know
what the fuck this is all about.

771
00:50:21,225 --> 00:50:23,310
I gave you 48 hours
to come up with something,

772
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:24,519
and the clock's running.

773
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,563
Yeah, well, maybe I don't like
the way you asked me, all right?

774
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:28,899
Who gives a goddamn what you like?

775
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:31,526
You're just a crook on a weekend pass.

776
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:34,279
You're not even
a goddamn name anymore.

777
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:35,697
You're just a spear-chucker

778
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,742
with a number stenciled
on the back of his prison fatigues.

779
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:43,455
All right, I'm through fucking around.

780
00:50:44,81 --> 00:50:45,123
You tell me the truth,

781
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:48,84
or you're gonna get the living shit
beat out of you.

782
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:51,504
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass now?
I think you've lost your mind, Cates.

783
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,298
Why don't you put your gun
back in your holster

784
00:50:53,382 --> 00:50:54,758
and get in the car, and let's go?

785
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,343
I'm serious. I'm not in the mood.

786
00:50:56,427 --> 00:50:58,261
And I'm just gonna end up
fucking you up out here.

787
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,598
This is gonna be an embarrassment
to you and the police force.

788
00:51:02,16 --> 00:51:05,518
Let me explain one thing to you, nigger.
I fight dirty.

789
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,62
You little fucker.

790
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:53,858
You pushed me in the fucking garbage!

791
00:51:55,486 --> 00:51:57,237
Get the fuck off me!

792
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,527
All right, you two, what's going on here?

793
00:52:38,29 --> 00:52:40,280
- Nothing.
- It's all right. I'm a cop.

794
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,574
Yeah, sure.
Get your hands above your head!

795
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:46,661
I'm too fucking tired
to put my hands above my head.

796
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,705
My gun and badge
are over there in the car.

797
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,540
Check it out, Bill.

798
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,417
Get in the car!

799
00:52:57,798 --> 00:52:59,883
Just what the hell is going on here?

800
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,844
We got a burglary call.

801
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:06,348
Two women said a couple of hoods
broke into their place posing as cops.

802
00:53:06,432 --> 00:53:09,267
Yeah. I was following a lead.
We rousted them.

803
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,896
Why don't you guys go sweet-talk 'em,
straighten it out?

804
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,857
I got a better idea.
Why don't you do it yourself?

805
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,735
We've got better things to do
than straighten out your messes.

806
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:21,571
I'll file a report tomorrow.

807
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:23,656
Yeah, well, I got to file a report tonight.

808
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:26,117
Yeah? Goes with the territory.

809
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,464
It's a good thing your friends came
when they did, Cates.

810
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:42,675
- I was getting ready to get in your ass.
- Yeah? You want to try it again?

811
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,846
- You'd just call your buddies back.
- They saved your ass, convict.

812
00:53:46,931 --> 00:53:49,557
That's what you'll tell them
down at the station house tonight.

813
00:53:49,642 --> 00:53:50,892
Yeah. Right.

814
00:53:51,18 --> 00:53:53,478
I'll even put it in my report that way.

815
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:55,480
Yeah. I bet you will.

816
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,820
- How much do I owe you?
- 10 bucks.

817
00:54:04,865 --> 00:54:06,324
Motherfucker.

818
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:12,831
Hammond!

819
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:18,628
You come clean, or we're going again
right here, right now.

820
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:22,257
I want to know what's going on
between you and Ganz.

821
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,976
Look, man, I've been waiting for
some money for a long time, all right?

822
00:54:33,60 --> 00:54:34,310
How much?

823
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:36,479
Half a million dollars.

824
00:54:37,648 --> 00:54:39,190
You starting to get the picture now?

825
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,860
You're on the wrong side
of the law-and-order business, Jack.

826
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:44,487
Just tell me about the goddamn money.

827
00:54:46,615 --> 00:54:49,868
Me and some my friends hit a dealer
during a sale.

828
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,205
It's the kind of money
nobody reports stolen.

829
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,292
One of the guys turned around
and dropped dime on me.

830
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:59,878
Happens to be the same guy
that's running around shooting people

831
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:01,337
with a certain cop's gun.

832
00:55:02,06 --> 00:55:03,631
So he's after your money.

833
00:55:03,716 --> 00:55:06,176
You know, you're a real bright cop!
You know that, Jack?

834
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,803
So how much you want, man?

835
00:55:10,14 --> 00:55:13,183
- You want to split 50-50?
- Not likely, convict.

836
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:15,894
Oh, I can't have nothing now, right?

837
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,395
I believe in the merit system.

838
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,772
So far you ain't built up no points, boy.

839
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:22,650
Oh, well, then, I'll be real good
from now on, Mr. Cates.

840
00:55:22,735 --> 00:55:25,69
Just tell me
where the goddamn money is.

841
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:30,992
In the trunk of my car.

842
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,370
Right, partner.

843
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:43,213
But get this, man.

844
00:55:43,297 --> 00:55:45,924
We ain't brothers, we ain't partners,
and we ain't friends.

845
00:55:46,08 --> 00:55:48,885
Now, if Ganz gets away with my money,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me.

846
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:50,637
I'm already sorry.

847
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:11,241
- All right, where's the goddamn car?
- Be cool, man. The car's parked.

848
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,785
For three years? Bullshit!

849
00:56:13,994 --> 00:56:17,622
Bullshit?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

850
00:56:17,831 --> 00:56:19,582
You just passed it.

851
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,808
Okay, now what?

852
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:41,312
Now you get to play cop
and watch that building back there.

853
00:56:42,356 --> 00:56:44,315
I'm gonna get in the back seat
and go to sleep.

854
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,817
You son of a bitch!

855
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:47,485
You knew where the money was
all along.

856
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,821
All we had to do
was come here and wait.

857
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:52,574
Christ, I almost got
my ass shot off twice for nothing!

858
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:55,535
Yeah, well, being a cop
is a hard job, Jack.

859
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,371
The building opens up at 7:00.
Wake me up at a quarter to.

860
00:56:58,455 --> 00:57:00,81
I'll be back here asleep.

861
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:01,291
Shit!

862
00:57:04,03 --> 00:57:05,169
Jack,

863
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:08,464
tell me a story.

864
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:09,841
Fuck you!

865
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:12,385
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

866
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:16,55
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,933
I didn't want you sleeping on the job.

868
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:03,186
Yo, man,
that place opens in five minutes.

869
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,520
You better go look for Ganz.

870
00:58:04,605 --> 00:58:06,814
You took a big chance
leaving it here all this time.

871
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:07,982
No, I didn't, man.

872
00:58:08,67 --> 00:58:09,609
I knew Ganz was gonna be
away for a while,

873
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:13,112
and I knew Luther wouldn't cross me.
The boy ain't got no heart.

874
00:58:13,197 --> 00:58:16,32
Guess what?
Luther just crossed the street.

875
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:21,37
That's a damned shame, man.

876
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:22,830
The guy took a shot at a cop
yesterday night,

877
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:24,582
and he's running around
on the street today.

878
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,501
The judicial system ain't shit.

879
00:58:26,585 --> 00:58:28,961
Must've had a primo bail bondsman.

880
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:32,715
Hey, buddy, I want to pick up my car.

881
00:58:33,50 --> 00:58:36,427
- What's the name?
- Hammond. Reggie Hammond.

882
00:58:37,596 --> 00:58:40,973
- This is three years old.
- Yeah. I've been busy!

883
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:45,645
Hey, Al, get a load of this.
Bring down 29-012.

884
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,689
It's been here three years.

885
00:58:47,773 --> 00:58:49,190
How about charging the battery?

886
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:53,27
- We take care of that every month.
- Great. Just great.

887
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:02,662
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

888
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:15,675
There he is.

889
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,461
Goddamn!
Look at all that dust on my car!

890
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,46
Why the fuck don't he take it
to a car wash?

891
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:57,425
I didn't know you darker people
went in for foreign jobs.

892
00:59:57,509 --> 00:59:58,593
Yeah, well, I had no choice.

893
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:02,346
Some white asshole bought
the last piece-of-shit sky-blue Cadillac.

894
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:38,591
Yo, man, I hope to God

895
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:40,676
none of my fellas see me riding around
in this car, man.

896
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:41,844
You really let this shit go bad.

897
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,388
What you don't understand is,
I don't care how it looks.

898
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:47,517
- It ain't got no class, Jack.
- Class isn't something you buy.

899
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:50,853
Look at you. You got a $500 suit on,
and you're still a low-life.

900
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,814
Yeah, but I look good.

901
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:19,382
That goddamn suit is yours?

902
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,551
Them suits was in style
a couple years back.

903
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:22,635
Yeah, right.

904
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,597
If you ever switch from armed robber
to a pimp, you're all set.

905
01:01:31,937 --> 01:01:34,313
- There's the money, Jack.
- Yeah, right.

906
01:01:36,608 --> 01:01:38,109
Look out, now!

907
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:42,780
Hold it! Hold it! Whoa! Whoa!

908
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:44,824
Whoa! Whoa!

909
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,767
Hey, you! Put that down!

910
01:04:26,69 --> 01:04:27,611
Luther! Luther!

911
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,706
I'm going after the money, Jack.

912
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:06,901
Come on!

913
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:09,904
Stay close to me.

914
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,332
Freeze!

915
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:04,458
I'm a cop!

916
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,669
Drop it, or you're all done!

917
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,296
Well, look, just meet me at Vroman's
and bring the shit, okay?

918
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,714
Thank you.

919
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:27,541
Vodka with a twist!
And I'd like to run up a tab, please.

920
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:29,919
Yeah, right.

921
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:33,130
Hey, babe.
My name's Reggie Hammond.

922
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:34,882
Well, so what?

923
01:07:39,512 --> 01:07:42,973
- My name's Reggie Hammond.
- I'm with somebody.

924
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,272
How you doing?
My name's Reggie Hammond.

925
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:54,818
This ain't my night.

926
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:35,25
- You look awful.
- Yeah, well, so do you.

927
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,944
It's been a long day.

928
01:08:37,445 --> 01:08:39,822
Long night, too, from what I heard.

929
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:44,201
Word's going around that in addition
to losing Ganz for the second time,

930
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:46,370
some soul brother
beat the crap out of you.

931
01:08:46,454 --> 01:08:48,414
Oh, bullshit. You heard the story wrong.

932
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:51,292
- Doesn't look like it.
- Did anything come in yet? Any calls?

933
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:52,626
Nothing.

934
01:08:55,46 --> 01:08:56,213
Kehoe.

935
01:08:57,257 --> 01:08:58,590
Ordnance.

936
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,637
- Yeah?
- Reports are late, Cates.

937
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:04,805
- Yeah.
- I need 'em.

938
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:06,432
- Yeah, I'll be in tomorrow.
- 9:00 sharp.

939
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:09,560
Yeah, for Christ's sake.
You can depend on it. Jesus!

940
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:12,896
Bullshit.

941
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,648
I'm heading out for a while.
How about you?

942
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,400
No, I got to wait for a call.

943
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:17,693
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

944
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:19,320
You know,
you really ought to get some rest.

945
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:20,487
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

946
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:22,448
Hello? Yeah. He's here.

947
01:09:22,907 --> 01:09:25,159
Cates. For you. Line 3.

948
01:09:27,78 --> 01:09:29,246
Hey, motherfucker,
where the hell are you?

949
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,665
I'm at work, asshole! Where else?

950
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:33,876
Elaine.

951
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:37,379
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought it was somebody else.

952
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,672
Police business.

953
01:09:38,882 --> 01:09:41,91
Yeah, no wonder you're so popular.

954
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:45,12
Look, I'm sorry about
the way things have been lately.

955
01:09:45,96 --> 01:09:47,556
I know I have not been acting real great.

956
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,350
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

957
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:50,517
Jack?

958
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:51,727
I almost forgot.

959
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:54,521
That pal of yours from the vice squad
wants you to call him.

960
01:09:54,606 --> 01:09:55,981
Jack, are you still there?

961
01:09:57,108 --> 01:09:58,859
He said he rousted a bar with you
last night.

962
01:09:58,943 --> 01:10:00,861
Well, why in the hell
didn't you tell me that before?

963
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:03,113
Hey, I'm not paid
to take your personal calls.

964
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:05,115
Well, what's
the goddamn number, Kehoe?

965
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,451
It's on my desk. Find it yourself.

966
01:10:08,78 --> 01:10:10,120
Elaine, I got to put you on hold
for just a second.

967
01:10:10,205 --> 01:10:13,624
No. No, don't put me on hold!
Jack, don't put me...

968
01:10:15,01 --> 01:10:16,752
You son of a bitch.

969
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:21,673
It's under the light.

970
01:10:36,731 --> 01:10:37,731
Reggie Hammond.

971
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,67
Hammond, you son of a bitch.
Where the hell are you?

972
01:10:40,151 --> 01:10:42,319
Jack! How have you been?

973
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:46,990
Yeah, I've been waiting for you to call.
Yeah. I'm at Vroman's.

974
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:49,868
Vroman's in the Fillmore.

975
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:52,329
Yeah, I know
you don't know about this place.

976
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,872
The brothers hang out here.

977
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:55,707
They probably wouldn't let
your tight ass in.

978
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,669
All right, I'll be right there.
Don't move your ass.

979
01:11:00,672 --> 01:11:01,630
- Jack.
- Yeah?

980
01:11:01,714 --> 01:11:04,383
- Elaine's on the other line.
- Oh, Jesus!

981
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:07,553
- Elaine?
- Jack?

982
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:09,12
Fuck you!

983
01:11:10,14 --> 01:11:11,265
Shit.

984
01:12:59,582 --> 01:13:02,793
- Hey, listen, my name is Reggie.
- I'm Candy.

985
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:04,02
Yo, look, Candy,

986
01:13:04,87 --> 01:13:06,547
if I don't get some trim before
the night's over, I'm gonna bust.

987
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:07,589
What?

988
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,968
Some trim, some mugambo, some sex.

989
01:13:11,52 --> 01:13:14,346
Are you crazy?
You can't ask me any better than that?

990
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:18,16
Look, you don't understand. It's 10:05.

991
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:20,519
By 10: 10, I want to be
into some flesh, okay?

992
01:13:20,603 --> 01:13:23,355
Let's just go across the street over here.
Wait a second.

993
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:25,774
I don't have no money.
Do you have any money on you?

994
01:13:25,858 --> 01:13:28,735
You mean to tell me
that you can't even pay for the room?

995
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,572
- Hammond!
- Hey, Jack, what's happening?

996
01:13:31,656 --> 01:13:33,782
I want you to meet my friend Candy.
This is Jack.

997
01:13:33,866 --> 01:13:35,951
- Hello.
- And goodbye.

998
01:13:36,35 --> 01:13:38,453
Well, maybe I'll see you later.

999
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:39,580
Yeah, I hope so.

1000
01:13:39,664 --> 01:13:41,582
You know, that's some rude shit
to be pulling, man.

1001
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,83
That's the second time this week.

1002
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,586
- Where's Luther?
- Where's Ganz?

1003
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:46,753
We missed.

1004
01:13:46,838 --> 01:13:48,589
No, we didn't miss nothing.
You missed, man.

1005
01:13:48,673 --> 01:13:50,924
Luther went and took a cab
to that hotel across the street,

1006
01:13:51,09 --> 01:13:52,50
and he made a phone call.

1007
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:53,802
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

1008
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:55,95
Don't make no sense to go get him.

1009
01:13:55,179 --> 01:13:58,599
He left an 8:00 wake-up call,
put a "do not disturb" sign on his door,

1010
01:13:58,683 --> 01:13:59,683
and tomorrow morning,

1011
01:13:59,767 --> 01:14:01,435
he'll go and exchange
the money for the girl.

1012
01:14:01,519 --> 01:14:04,521
Only thing that's going to stop us
from catching Ganz is going blind, man.

1013
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,690
Why didn't you just take the money
and split?

1014
01:14:07,66 --> 01:14:10,944
I could've did that,
but I want Ganz just as bad as you do.

1015
01:14:11,29 --> 01:14:13,697
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

1016
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,240
Ta-da!

1017
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:19,911
Keep it. I'm too tired to argue about that.

1018
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,377
Thanks for calling.

1019
01:14:30,548 --> 01:14:32,49
You know, I...

1020
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:39,389
Well, "nigger" and "watermelon,"
I didn't mean that stuff.

1021
01:14:40,58 --> 01:14:42,893
I was just doing my job,
keeping you down.

1022
01:14:44,62 --> 01:14:47,522
Yeah, well, doing your job
don't explain everything, Jack.

1023
01:14:47,732 --> 01:14:49,399
Yeah, you're right.

1024
01:14:56,74 --> 01:14:58,492
Well, as long as you're feeling
like Abraham Lincoln...

1025
01:14:58,576 --> 01:15:01,495
Listen, you see that girl over there
that you just made walk away?

1026
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:02,663
Yeah.

1027
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,539
She would love to take me to the hotel
across the street

1028
01:15:04,624 --> 01:15:08,377
and fuck my brains out,
but I ain't got no money for a room.

1029
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,963
I got...

1030
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:21,556
- I got a 20. Yeah.
- This should be fine.

1031
01:15:23,309 --> 01:15:24,393
Have fun, huh?

1032
01:15:24,477 --> 01:15:27,62
- I'm going to have sex, Jack.
- Yeah.

1033
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:35,237
- You come here often, home?
- Yeah. This is my favorite place.

1034
01:15:38,282 --> 01:15:42,285
Hey, this is my wife!
You whispering in my wife's ear?

1035
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,621
I got rent money for one night!

1036
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,667
Lack of pussy make you brave, man!

1037
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:51,420
Come on, let's go.

1038
01:15:56,509 --> 01:15:58,385
Excuse me, brothers. Excuse me.

1039
01:15:58,469 --> 01:16:00,429
So where do you want to go?

1040
01:16:00,513 --> 01:16:03,223
We can go right across the street
to the hotel if you want.

1041
01:16:03,307 --> 01:16:04,641
All right.

1042
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,772
Oh, shit. Come on.

1043
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:12,983
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

1044
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,238
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1045
01:16:18,322 --> 01:16:19,322
I'm sorry.

1046
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:22,75
- That was quick.
- Luther's on the move, man.

1047
01:16:55,485 --> 01:16:57,27
Open your coat.

1048
01:16:58,29 --> 01:16:59,404
Both sides.

1049
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:04,367
- Let her go.
- Money first.

1050
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,703
Just show me!

1051
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:11,625
Set it there.

1052
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:15,295
- Rosalie, are you okay?
- Luther!

1053
01:17:15,379 --> 01:17:17,297
What are you talking about, huh?

1054
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:20,50
I said I wouldn't hurt her, didn't I?

1055
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:30,954
A bus! You goddamn whiskey mick cop!

1056
01:18:31,38 --> 01:18:35,125
You lost a stolen bus!
I got five deaths related to Ganz!

1057
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:38,44
And you blow it for
a lousy nigger convict!

1058
01:18:39,463 --> 01:18:42,299
That's right! I called him a nigger!
You bet I did!

1059
01:18:43,50 --> 01:18:44,134
Come on.

1060
01:18:44,218 --> 01:18:46,219
Now, I saw the report
on that little piece of shit.

1061
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:49,723
If he's spent one legal day in his life,
it'll be a record!

1062
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:51,141
And this is it for you!

1063
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:53,977
Suspension, review board!
You've had it!

1064
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:57,230
As soon as it get round you protected
a con rather than nail a cop killer...

1065
01:18:57,315 --> 01:18:59,316
Wait a minute, god damn it!

1066
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:02,27
I'm gonna tell you
something about this man.

1067
01:19:02,111 --> 01:19:04,487
He's got more brains
than you'll ever know!

1068
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:08,366
He's got more guts
than any partner I ever had!

1069
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,913
Just 'cause you say it with conviction,
it don't mean shit to me!

1070
01:19:13,122 --> 01:19:14,998
Let's get out of here.

1071
01:19:18,85 --> 01:19:20,545
And where the Christ
do you think you're going?

1072
01:19:22,89 --> 01:19:24,257
Don't you think
you're being kind of hard on the guy?

1073
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,635
You go fuck yourself, convict!

1074
01:19:46,906 --> 01:19:49,908
- How'd my car get here?
- I had it impounded.

1075
01:19:51,452 --> 01:19:53,870
We'll use it to take you
back to the slam.

1076
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,539
Now, wait a minute.
Ganz got away with all my money,

1077
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:59,542
and you're going to take me back to jail
in my own car?

1078
01:19:59,627 --> 01:20:01,795
Somehow this shit just don't seem right.

1079
01:20:01,879 --> 01:20:04,547
Yeah, a lot of things don't seem right.

1080
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:08,134
I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

1081
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,845
I'll buy. It'll be my goodbye present.

1082
01:20:12,223 --> 01:20:14,265
I feel real bad, Jack.
I feel like I let you down.

1083
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:17,727
No, you didn't let me down.
Hell, it was a long shot.

1084
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,939
We gave him a hell of a run, though.

1085
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,692
But we didn't catch him, man.

1086
01:20:59,311 --> 01:21:01,563
- Hello?
- Yeah, let me talk to Kehoe.

1087
01:21:01,647 --> 01:21:03,148
Yeah. Hold on.

1088
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:12,32
Kehoe, answer the damn phone.
It's for you.

1089
01:21:12,491 --> 01:21:13,742
Hold on.

1090
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:16,369
- Yeah?
- Kehoe, how's it going?

1091
01:21:16,996 --> 01:21:18,204
Not so good.

1092
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:21,916
- What about the other guys?
- They're all on the street.

1093
01:21:22,293 --> 01:21:24,836
- How about the airport?
- It's clean.

1094
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,380
- Train station?
- Same deal.

1095
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:30,717
They dumped the bus in Chinatown.

1096
01:21:31,594 --> 01:21:33,887
Other than that, we got nothing.

1097
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:37,15
All right. I'll get back to you later on.

1098
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:46,149
Nothing. No Ganz, no Indian.

1099
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:49,694
Airport's clean, bus station,
train stations, docks...

1100
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:50,862
Shit.

1101
01:21:52,281 --> 01:21:53,698
That's too bad, Jack.

1102
01:21:53,824 --> 01:21:56,868
Looks like the partnership ended
before it got a chance to start, huh?

1103
01:21:56,952 --> 01:21:59,37
Yeah, some partnership, huh?

1104
01:22:00,831 --> 01:22:04,834
- What's up with your lady?
- Hell, we had another fight. Why?

1105
01:22:06,03 --> 01:22:08,171
If I was depressed and had a lady,
I'd go see her, man.

1106
01:22:08,255 --> 01:22:09,255
It'd make me feel better.

1107
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,132
I figure you wanted
to do the same thing.

1108
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:14,385
Nah. I'll make it up to her tomorrow.

1109
01:22:16,847 --> 01:22:18,973
You think that big Indian
will go down to Chinatown

1110
01:22:19,58 --> 01:22:20,850
- and try to patch it up with his girl?
- No, man.

1111
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,102
Billy's girl don't want to see him.

1112
01:22:22,186 --> 01:22:23,353
I don't think he'll be going back there.

1113
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:25,730
Well, they got the bus
down in Chinatown.

1114
01:22:25,856 --> 01:22:27,607
Jack, you're reaching for shit now,
all right?

1115
01:22:27,691 --> 01:22:28,858
Yeah, but you're the one that said

1116
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:30,944
when you're on the run,
you go back and visit your girl.

1117
01:22:31,28 --> 01:22:33,780
Yeah, but Billy's girl don't have
no interest in his crotch, Jack.

1118
01:22:33,864 --> 01:22:35,573
She want to put some bullets
in his behind.

1119
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:37,617
Yeah, I am reaching. What the hell.

1120
01:22:37,701 --> 01:22:41,287
You got important things to do,
like going back to jail.

1121
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,209
- Chinatown, huh?
- Yeah.

1122
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,21
There she is, Jack.

1123
01:23:13,70 --> 01:23:16,239
Whatever play I make,
you just back me up.

1124
01:23:17,408 --> 01:23:18,658
Come on.

1125
01:23:29,837 --> 01:23:31,963
- I hear you got visitors.
- Would you guys...

1126
01:23:32,47 --> 01:23:34,07
Shut up. Don't give me any crap.

1127
01:23:34,91 --> 01:23:37,302
Answer my questions
or I'll tear your fucking lungs out.

1128
01:23:37,386 --> 01:23:40,930
You're Billy's girl, aren't you?
You've always been his girl.

1129
01:23:41,15 --> 01:23:43,850
Listen, the man can live or die.
It's up to you.

1130
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:46,269
Let us in
and he has a chance to make it.

1131
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:48,396
Otherwise, he's a dead man.

1132
01:23:54,403 --> 01:23:55,904
He's in the first room down the hall.

1133
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:57,697
Where's Ganz?

1134
01:23:58,782 --> 01:24:01,117
He's in the back,
down the other corridor.

1135
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,869
All right. Come on.

1136
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:51,334
Give it up, Billy. You got no chance.

1137
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:02,887
Billy, you're going to lose.

1138
01:25:14,358 --> 01:25:15,608
Get down!

1139
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:19,696
Come on!

1140
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:25,618
Help me! Oh, God! Oh, God!

1141
01:25:32,334 --> 01:25:33,835
It's all over.

1142
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:40,466
Oh, God damn you!

1143
01:28:05,28 --> 01:28:06,529
You ought to know, Reggie,

1144
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:09,699
if you come up against me,
you're going to lose.

1145
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:12,285
Now, come on.

1146
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:15,37
There's one more little thing
I got to take care of.

1147
01:28:20,544 --> 01:28:22,879
Hey, cop! Come on!

1148
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:25,339
I got something for you!

1149
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,562
You're not going to make it.

1150
01:28:40,314 --> 01:28:43,483
What are you talking about?
I got your gun.

1151
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:46,402
I got the money. I got everything.

1152
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:51,157
Take aim, man,
and blow his fucking brains out!

1153
01:28:51,241 --> 01:28:53,159
Bullshit! He ain't gonna try it.

1154
01:28:53,243 --> 01:28:54,619
Right, cop?

1155
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:00,917
Are you crazy, man? I was just bluffing!

1156
01:29:04,796 --> 01:29:06,130
I got hit.

1157
01:29:07,966 --> 01:29:10,551
I don't believe it. I got shot!

1158
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:14,180
You're done. End of story.

1159
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:15,598
You...

1160
01:29:49,216 --> 01:29:51,259
- I got to go, okay?
- Okay.

1161
01:29:55,138 --> 01:29:58,224
Look, here's a little something for you.

1162
01:29:58,684 --> 01:30:00,226
I told you I wasn't a pro.

1163
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:02,103
Take that and buy yourself
something nice.

1164
01:30:02,187 --> 01:30:06,732
I'd do it, but I'm in a rush, okay?
I got a cop waiting for me downstairs.

1165
01:30:10,362 --> 01:30:12,488
I'll be back in about six months.

1166
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:15,408
We'll get together and go out
and have a good time, all right?

1167
01:30:15,492 --> 01:30:17,660
We'll go dancing or something.

1168
01:30:18,245 --> 01:30:20,705
Okay. You take care of yourself.

1169
01:30:21,248 --> 01:30:22,498
You, too.

1170
01:30:22,749 --> 01:30:23,749
Bye.

1171
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:25,543
I'll see you later.

1172
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:41,976
All right. Bust my chops.

1173
01:30:42,60 --> 01:30:44,770
Tell me how great you were
with that chick in there.

1174
01:30:44,855 --> 01:30:47,982
I'm not going in for
all that macho shit, Jack.

1175
01:30:48,358 --> 01:30:49,650
I was great.

1176
01:30:50,68 --> 01:30:52,278
I should have my dick bronzed.

1177
01:30:57,409 --> 01:30:59,744
This what you want to talk about?

1178
01:31:01,955 --> 01:31:03,372
Hey, come on, Jack. That's not fair.

1179
01:31:03,498 --> 01:31:05,583
I've been waiting for that money
for three years.

1180
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,168
What happened to
all that merit system shit

1181
01:31:07,252 --> 01:31:08,377
you was talking about?

1182
01:31:09,254 --> 01:31:10,379
It's your money.

1183
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,840
It'll be there in six months
when you get out.

1184
01:31:19,389 --> 01:31:20,640
And you don't want any of it?

1185
01:31:21,224 --> 01:31:22,683
Not my style.

1186
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:27,313
I need a car.

1187
01:31:27,397 --> 01:31:30,149
How about loaning me
a couple thousand when you get out?

1188
01:31:31,568 --> 01:31:33,235
What kind of car you want?

1189
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:35,71
Convertible.

1190
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:36,906
I'm a rag top man.

1191
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,286
- Deal.
- Good.

1192
01:31:50,03 --> 01:31:52,171
But even if you do give me
the money for a car,

1193
01:31:52,255 --> 01:31:53,506
it don't mean shit.

1194
01:31:54,49 --> 01:31:57,760
If I ever hear of you crossing the line,
I'll bust your ass.

1195
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:06,602
Now, Jack, the both of us know

1196
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:10,147
that I'm gonna be an honest man
from now on, right?

1197
01:32:10,232 --> 01:32:11,315
Good.

1198
01:32:14,277 --> 01:32:16,654
But if I did decide to be a thief,

1199
01:32:17,447 --> 01:32:20,74
what makes you think
you can catch me?

1200
01:32:22,786 --> 01:32:25,246
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?
