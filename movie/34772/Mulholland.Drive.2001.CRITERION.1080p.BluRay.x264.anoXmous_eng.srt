1
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you doing?
We don't stop here!

2
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,300
Get out of the car.

3
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
The boys found this ...

4
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,700
on the floor in back
of the Caddy.

5
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,800
Yeah, they showed me.

6
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,500
Could be unrelated.

7
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,100
Could be.

8
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?

9
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,800
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

10
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
That's what I'm thinkin'.

11
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,200
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,100
To Winkie's?

14
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,300
This Winkie's.

15
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,100
Okay.
Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,900
It's kind of embarrassing ...

17
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,400
Go ahead.

18
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,200
I had a dream about this place.

19
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh boy.

20
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,600
You see what I mean?

21
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

22
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
Tell me.

23
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Well ...

24
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
it's the second one I've had ...

25
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,600
but they are both the same ...

26
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
they start out that
I'm in here but ...

27
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,100
it's not day or night.

28
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
It's kinda half night, you know?

29
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,300
but it
looks just like this ...

30
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,600
except for the light.

31
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,000
And I'm scared like
I can't tell ya.

32
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Of all people,

33
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,000
you're standing right over there ...

34
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,400
by that counter.

35
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,900
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

36
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,500
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are and ...

37
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,400
then I realize what it is.

38
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's a man ...

39
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,900
in back of this place.

40
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,200
He's the one who's doing it.

41
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,500
I can see him through the wall.

42
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,300
I can see his face ...

43
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,200
I hope that I never
see that face ever ...

44
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,500
outside of the dream.

45
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,100
That's it.

46
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,900
So ...

47
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,600
you came to see if he's out there.

48
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,100
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

49
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,600
Right then.

50
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,500
It's around here.

51
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Dan? You all right?
Dan? Dan?

52
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,400
Hello?

53
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,900
The girl is still missing.

54
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Talk to me.

55
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,600
The same.

56
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh ...
I can't believe it!

57
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,900
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

58
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,900
It's been so nice
travelling with you.

59
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,400
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

60
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,100
It was sure great
to have you to talk to.

61
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,600
Remember I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

62
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,300
Okay Irene.
Won't that be the day.

63
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Good luck, Betty dear.

64
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,300
Take care of yourself
and be careful.

65
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,100
I will. Thanks again.

66
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

67
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,700
- Thank you.
- Bye.

68
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
My bags!

69
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,600
Where to?

70
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,300
1612 Havenhurst.

71
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Got it!

72
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,400
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

73
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,200
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

74
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

75
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

76
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,100
Pleased to meet you.
- Just call me Coco.

77
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,700
Everybody else does.
Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

78
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,100
OK, Coco.

79
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Wilkins?!
Wilkins?!?!

80
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,800
If that damned dog craps
in the courtyard one more time ...

81
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm just gonna bake his
little butt for breakfast.

82
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,700
You don't have pets do you?
- No, I don't.

83
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,300
They're allowed, I just don't like
'em here ... for obvious reasons.

84
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,900
You know, there was a man
that lived here once ...

85
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,600
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

86
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, you just wouldn't believe ...

87
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,100
what that kangaroo
did to this courtyard.

88
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,200
Let's see your Aunt's apartment
... it's a good one.

89
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,900
I can hardly wait!

90
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,800
It's unbelievable!

91
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,100
I told ya.
- Wow!

92
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,300
Well, you and your Aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

93
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,100
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

94
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,600
Everybody in this building's
pretty much okay with me ...

95
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,300
or they wouldn't be here.

96
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,700
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

97
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,200
No hard feelings if you don't.

98
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,100
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't
tell me someone was going to be here.

99
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,500
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK

100
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

101
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

102
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
There was an accident.

103
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,700
I came here.

104
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,400
I understand.
I saw the dress.

105
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,200
Sorry. Are you all right?

106
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,500
What happened?

107
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,100
A car ...

108
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,000
a car accident.

109
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh ... You OK?

110
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,100
I think so.

111
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,600
I was just ...

112
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,600
taking a shower.

113
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,600
Oh my god. I'm sorry.

114
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,700
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm going to get unpacked.

115
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,300
What's your name?

116
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here
and we can talk later.

117
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,000
My name's ...
Rita.

118
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,100
Hi ...

119
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,700
do you work with my Aunt?

120
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
No ... I ...
- Sorry ...

121
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,700
it's none of my business.

122
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,700
She has pretty red hair ...

123
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,000
She's letting me stay here
while she's working on a movie ...

124
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,000
that's being made in Canada ...

125
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,700
but I guess you already know that.

126
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,200
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

127
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,300
Unless of course I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

128
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,600
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star,

129
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,000
but sometimes people
end up being both ...

130
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,200
so that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

131
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,900
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited to be here ...

132
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,500
I mean I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario ...

133
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,300
now I'm in this ...

134
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,300
dream place.

135
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,300
You can imagine how I feel.

136
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,900
Oh ... What? Sit down ...

137
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,300
Where were you hurt?

138
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
We should call a doctor.
- No

139
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,000
But, this could be serious.
- No, I ...

140
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,900
I need to sleep.

141
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,200
If you have a concussion
you shouldn't sleep.

142
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,000
It will feel okay if I sleep.

143
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,100
I just need to
lie down here and sleep.

144
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,800
You see Adam ...
there are some suggestions

145
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that are to be brought forward ...

146
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,100
and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions

147
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,400
and that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

148
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,600
What are you talking about?

149
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,300
An open mind ...

150
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,600
You're in the process of
re-casting your lead actress and

151
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm ...

152
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,500
We're asking you to
keep an open mind.

153
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,000
What was it last time?

154
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,800
OK. Let's try the next one.

155
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,300
He's not gonna like it.

156
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,700
We'll see.

157
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,200
Ah ... Castigliane brothers.

158
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,900
Let me introduce you around ...

159
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,100
please ... take a seat.

160
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
this is Mr. Darby,
whom you know ...

161
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
and this is the
director Adam Kesher ...

162
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,100
and his manager Robert Smith.

163
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
Oh,

164
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,100
She's very pretty.

165
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,200
May I offer you, gentlemen ...
anything?

166
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,300
Espresso.
- Nothing.

167
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,500
- What's the photo for?
- An espresso.

168
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,800
No, that's it.

169
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I think you're gonna enjoy
your espresso this time.

170
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,800
I've done quite a bit of a research
knowing how hard you are to please.

171
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,500
This one comes highly recommended.

172
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,600
What's the photo for?

173
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
It's a recommendation ...

174
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,000
a recommendation to you, Adam,

175
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,000
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

176
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,900
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

177
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,400
We'd be happy to put her
on the list for consideration.

178
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,900
You'd be pleased to know there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

179
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,400
Interest? No.

180
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,200
There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

181
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,900
This is the girl.

182
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,100
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, Adam.

183
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,100
Hold on?

184
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,200
There's no way.
There's no way!

185
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,600
Napkin.

186
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,000
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

187
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,700
Of course.

188
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Excuse me.

189
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,100
Is that all sir?

190
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,500
Shit.

191
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Sorry!
That was a highly recommended ...

192
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,700
That's considered one of the finest
espressos in the world, Sir.

193
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,500
What's going on here? There's no
way that girl is in my movie.

194
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,000
HELP ME!

195
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,700
This is the girl.

196
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,900
Hey!
That girl is not in my film!

197
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,100
It's no longer your film.

198
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,100
This is the girl.

199
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,000
Did the Castigliane brothers
get out of that limo?

200
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,300
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

201
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,700
- Yes.
- Keep that door open.

202
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
Castigliane brothers?

203
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,900
Beat it, pal.

204
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,300
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

205
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

206
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,900
The director doesn't want her.

207
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,800
Do you want him replaced?

208
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,200
I know they said ...

209
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Then?

210
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,500
Then ...

211
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,200
that means we should ...

212
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Yes?

213
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,300
Shut everything down ...

214
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,900
Is that something that ...

215
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
do you want us ...

216
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,100
to shut everything down?

217
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,300
Then we'll shut everything down.

218
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh man, that's unheard of ...

219
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,500
an accident like that ...
who could have foreseen that?

220
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,100
- That's unreal, right?

221
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,900
Hell, yeah.

222
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,800
Unbelievable.

223
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,100
So, bro ... God you look good!

224
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,100
What have you been doin'?

225
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Just doin' some stuff
for this guy.

226
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,700
Yeah? Making ends meet, huh?

227
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,500
Hardly.

228
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,100
I know, man.

229
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,200
Look at my digs.

230
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,600
Times are tough, bro.

231
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,900
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

232
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,900
I hope you're not goin'
to get in any trouble.

233
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,000
It was just a thing.

234
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
The story made you laugh.

235
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,200
- It was a funny story.
- Fucking car accident.

236
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,300
Hey, so that's it?

237
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,400
It's the famous black book.

238
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,300
The history of the world
in phone numbers.

239
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,900
Oh, man!

240
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,500
Something bit me BAD!

241
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,400
God!

242
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,700
Hey man!

243
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,400
She's hurt bad! Could you come here and
call on the phone. Please I need you!

244
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,200
She's hurt bad!
You gotta call the hospital.

245
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,200
Come on man!
I'm serious about this!

246
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,600
I can't do everything by myself!

247
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,700
Hey man!

248
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,300
OH!

249
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,300
... okay Aunt Ruth ... I'll try.

250
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know them inside out.

251
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Yep, either here on this
fabulous leather couch ...

252
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,800
or I'll take them with
a coffee in the courtyard ...

253
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,700
like a regular movie star.

254
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,200
Oh! I got a real shock to
find your friend Rita here.

255
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,700
She was in the shower and
I opened the door ...

256
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,200
Rita.

257
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,900
What do you mean?

258
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,200
Well, she was in an accident.

259
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,600
Rita ... your friend.

260
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,600
No, Coco unlocked the door.

261
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,600
No, she didn't see her.

262
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,700
She's sleeping.

263
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm sure there's some explanation
for this Aunt Ruth,

264
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,700
I don't think we have to do that.

265
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:27,000
Please don't worry ...
we don't need the police.

266
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,900
You're awake ...

267
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,700
I think I misunderstood.

268
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,400
I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here.

269
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,800
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

270
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm ... sorry. I ...

271
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,000
What is it Rita?

272
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,600
I thought when I woke up ...

273
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,400
I thought sleep would do it ...

274
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,600
What's wrong?

275
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,100
I don't know who I am.

276
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,300
What do you mean?
You're Rita.

277
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,600
I'm not.
I don't know what my name is.

278
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,300
I don't know who I am!

279
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,500
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

280
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,100
You want to know, don't you?

281
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,100
I ... yes, but ... I ...
- Open it!

282
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,300
You sure you don't want anything?
- Not here ... no thanks.

283
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,200
Not a coke or something?

284
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,900
No ... thanks though ...

285
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,400
I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.

286
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,900
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

287
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,000
Any new girls on the street lately?

288
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,400
No. I haven't seen any.

289
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,400
A brunette?

290
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,100
Maybe a little beat up?

291
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,600
You'll keep your eyes open
for me won't you baby?

292
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,600
- Sure.
- You bet you will.

293
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,500
That money.

294
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,200
You don't know where it came from?

295
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:39,500
When you think of them ...
the money ... the key ...

296
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,400
does it make you remember anything?

297
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,900
something ...

298
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,100
... something there.

299
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,500
What did you say?

300
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,700
They fired everyone.

301
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,000
Who fired everyone?

302
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,300
Ray did!
Please I'm talking on the phone,

303
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,500
and then they closed the set ...
everybody's gone.

304
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,200
You'd better get down here Adam!

305
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,100
You've got to talk to Ray
you've got to fix this.

306
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,800
I'm going home.

307
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,300
Home?!

308
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,300
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something.

309
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,300
You've got to do something Adam!

310
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,500
I'm going home, Cynthia.

311
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,600
Adam, this isn't like you.

312
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,300
Please come to the office.

313
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,600
- There must be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

314
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,000
I wonder where you were going.

315
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,100
Mulholland Drive.

316
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
Mulholland Drive?

317
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,700
That's where I was going ...

318
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Mulholland Drive.

319
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,900
Maybe that's where the accident was.

320
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,600
There must be a police report.
We could call ...

321
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,700
We could call anonymously
from a pay phone ...

322
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,800
just to see if there was an accident.

323
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,500
Come on. It'll be just
like in the movies.

324
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:36,700
We'll pretend to be someone else.

325
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,800
I want to walk around anyway.

326
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,300
I'm in Hollywood and I haven't
even seen any of it.

327
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,000
Come on Rita.
Do you feel up to it?

328
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,500
Okay ... but just ...

329
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,300
just to see.

330
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Just to see
if there was an accident ...

331
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,800
on Mulholland Drive.

332
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,600
Lorraine?

333
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,300
Lorraine ... you home?

334
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,000
Lorraine ...

335
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,500
Now, you've done it!

336
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:30,200
Just forget you ever saw.
It's better that way.

337
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,000
What the hell are you
even doing here?

338
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,500
What are you doing?

339
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,900
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!

340
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,900
That bastard.
You bastard!

341
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,800
He's probably upset Lorraine.

342
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,400
WHAT ... ARE ... YOU ... DOING!?

343
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,500
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

344
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,800
Adam, STOP IT!

345
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,200
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

346
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,800
Adam, STOP IT!

347
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:45,700
What're you doin'
You're hurting me!

348
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,000
That's not a way to treat your wife,
buddy. I don't care what she's done.

349
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,200
Throw him out!

350
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,500
Throw him out!

351
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,300
Get out!

352
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,600
Let's hide it.

353
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,800
There's one.

354
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Hollywood Police Department

355
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,700
I'm inquiring about an accident that
happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

356
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,800
Hold please.
I'll connect you to traffic.

357
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,300
- Sergeant Baxter,
- Hi. I'm inquiring ...

358
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,000
well, I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car-crash and ...

359
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,200
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

360
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,200
Yes, there was.

361
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,300
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No. I can't.

362
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,800
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name please?

363
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,300
There was an accident.

364
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,400
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident Rita.

365
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,100
I just know it was.

366
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,500
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

367
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,500
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee
and we can see.

368
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,700
Maybe it happened so late it's
not going to be in today's paper.

369
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,400
There's nothing?

370
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,000
Not that I can see.

371
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,400
That's Ok.

372
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Thanks ...

373
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,300
... Diane.

374
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,900
That'd be all?
You want your check?

375
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,500
Rita, you want something?

376
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,700
- No. Just the coffee.
- I'll take our check.

377
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,000
What is it Rita?
- Shhhh.

378
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,000
I remember something ...

379
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,600
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

380
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Maybe that's my name.

381
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,500
D. Selwyn ... it's the only one.

382
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,200
I'm gonna call.

383
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,100
It's strange to be calling yourself.

384
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,800
Maybe it's not me.

385
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,900
Hello ... this is me.

386
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,500
Leave me a message.

387
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,500
It's not my voice ...

388
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,300
but I know her.

389
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,000
Maybe that isn't
Diane Selwyn's voice.

390
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,300
Maybe that's your roommate ...

391
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,800
or if it is Diane Selwyn ...

392
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,100
she can tell you who you are.

393
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,000
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

394
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,900
- Yeah, right ... get lost!
- Is this Adam Kesher's house?

395
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,700
Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!

396
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,000
Get out!

397
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:02,300
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

398
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,800
I guess you don't understand English.
She said to leave.

399
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,800
Here's the door.

400
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,200
OUT!

401
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,300
- Yeah ... what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry Mr. Kesher ...

402
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,400
but there seems to be some problem
with your credit cards.

403
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,900
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

404
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,100
Fact is two guys
from your bank came by.

405
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,700
My bank?

406
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,200
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

407
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,500
What did they say?

408
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,000
I'm afraid they said
you're maxed out at your bank ...

409
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,100
and your line of credit
has been cancelled.

410
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,700
It's unbelievable.

411
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Look ...

412
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,000
I don't know what's going on.

413
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,700
That's so much baloney.

414
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

415
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,100
I know ... I know ...

416
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,100
Don't worry ...

417
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,600
It was my duty to inform you.

419
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:52,800
People you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

420
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,100
Right.

421
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,200
I'm sorry.

422
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,600
Hello?

423
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,600
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

424
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,600
I know. Where are you Adam?

425
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,900
What do you mean you know?

426
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,900
Somebody called.
When they couldn't get you ...

427
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,300
they told me you
were as good as broke.

428
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

429
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,000
- And?
- You're broke!

430
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,700
But I'm not broke!

431
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,200
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

432
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,700
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

433
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,400
Do you know somebody
called the "The Cowboy"?

434
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,800
- "The Cowboy"?
- Yes

435
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,500
Yeah, the Cowboy.

436
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,600
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

437
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,700
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

438
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,100
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go to see the Cowboy.

439
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,400
Should I wear my ten gallon
hat and my six shooters?

440
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,200
Listen. Something tells me this guy
is connected to what's happening,

441
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,100
and I think you should do it and
I think you should do it right away.

442
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,100
What's going on, Cynthia?

443
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,300
It's been a very strange day ...

444
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,100
and getting stranger.

445
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,900
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean ...
do I have to ride out to the range?

446
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,200
Sort of, funny boy.

447
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,300
If I tell him the
meeting's on ...

448
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,100
you have to go to the top of
Beachwood Canyon.

449
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,200
There's a corral up
there where he'll be.

450
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,900
You've got to be kidding me!

451
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,400
Will you meet with him?

452
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,600
Yeah, sure.

453
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,000
It's been that kind of a day.
When?

454
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,200
I'll call him, right away ...

455
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,900
then I'll call you back.

456
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,100
You could stay at my place,
if you want it.

457
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,300
Cynthia ... I don't think
it'll be a good idea.

458
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,700
I'm just offering a place to stay.

459
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,000
And I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

460
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,400
Now go on and give the Cowboy
a yodel and get back to me.

461
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,200
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

462
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,200
Just get along little dowgie
and call me back.

463
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,900
It's right about
here on Sierra Bonita.

464
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,900
That's not too far away.

465
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,000
What's wrong with that?

466
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,700
I'm not sure about this.

467
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,400
I know you're afraid of something.

468
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,300
We'll be careful. Promise.

469
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,800
Tomorrow we'll go over there ...

470
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,600
and we'll find out.

471
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,400
It'll be okay.

472
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,300
It's probably Coco.

473
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,500
Yes?

474
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,900
May I help you?

475
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,800
Someone is in trouble.

476
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,800
Who are you?

477
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,700
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

478
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,900
She's letting me stay here.

479
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,500
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

480
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,300
No it's not.

481
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,000
That's not what she said.

482
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:50,800
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

483
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,400
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and ...

484
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,100
Louise ...
What are you doing Louise?

485
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,200
Oh, Coco! I've been trying to find
you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock.

486
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,700
That one is in my room
and she won't leave.

487
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,600
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

488
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,400
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

489
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,600
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

490
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,700
In fact and fortunately I was
just on my way here to see Betty.

491
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,500
Betty's a young actress
and I was just delivering ...

492
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,900
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

493
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,800
- Well, here they are honey.
- Oh, thank you.

494
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,400
Now come along Louise
and I'll take you home.

495
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,400
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes.
Come on.

496
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,000
No, she said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

497
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Stop it, Louise.
I'm taking you home ...

498
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,200
Come on.

499
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,100
- Goodnight Betty.
- Goodnight.

500
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,400
Goodnight.

501
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Cowboy!

502
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,500
- Howdy!
- Howdy to you.

503
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,400
Beautiful evening.

504
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,700
Sure want to thank ya for coming
all the way up to see me ...

505
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,800
from that nice hotel Downtown.

506
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:58,600
No problem.
What's on your mind?

507
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,200
Well now, here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

508
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,100
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

509
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:09,300
Whatever.

510
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,200
A man's attitude ...

511
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,100
a man's attitude goes some ways ...

512
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,900
the way his life will be.

513
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,300
Is that somethin'
you might agree with?

514
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,100
Sure.

515
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,100
Now ... did you answer because you thought
that's what I wanted to hear ...

516
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,400
or did you think about what I said ...

517
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,600
and answer cause you
truly believe that to be right?

518
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:40,400
I agree with what you said ... truly.

519
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,100
What did I say?

520
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,600
That a man's attitude determines to a
large extent how his life will be.

521
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,200
So since you agree ...

522
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,300
you must be a person who does
not care about the good life.

523
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:02,200
How's that?

524
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:06,100
Well, stop for a little second
and think about it.

525
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,200
Can you do that for me?

526
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,600
Okay, I'm thinking.

527
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,400
No. You're not thinkin'

528
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,700
You're too busy being
a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

529
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,100
Now I want ya to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

530
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,500
Can you try that for me?

531
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,300
Look ... where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

532
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,000
There's sometimes a buggy.

533
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,400
How many drivers does a buggy have?

534
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,400
One.

535
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,700
So let's just say
I'm drivin' this buggy ...

536
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:51,700
and you if fix your attitude
you can ride along with me.

537
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,200
Okay.

538
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,300
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

539
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,800
You were re-casting the lead
actress anyway ...

540
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,000
audition many girls for the part.

541
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:09,000
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

542
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,400
"This is the girl".

543
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,000
The rest of the cast can stay.

544
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,700
That is up to you.

545
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,300
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

546
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,600
Now, you will see me
one more time ...

547
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,200
if you do good.

548
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,400
You will see me two more times ...

549
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,800
if you do bad.

550
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,200
Good night.

551
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,400
You're still here?

552
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,300
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

553
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,100
Nobody wants you here!

554
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,100
Really?

555
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,800
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

556
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
- So ... surprise ...
- I can call them ... I can call my dad ...

557
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
But you won't ...

558
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,700
If you're trying to blackmail me ...
it's not going to work.

559
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,700
You're playing a dangerous game here.

560
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,200
You know what I want ...
it's not that difficult.

561
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,800
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad ...

562
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
he trusts you ...
you're his best friend.

563
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,500
This will be the end of everything.

564
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,800
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

565
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,400
Stop! Just stop! That's what
you said from the beginning.

566
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,600
If I tell what happened ...
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

567
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,700
so get out of here before ...

568
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,300
Before what?

569
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,600
Before I kill you.

570
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,700
Then they'd put you in jail.

571
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,100
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then
I say with big emotion:

572
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,600
"I hate you ... I hate us both!"

573
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,800
Such a lame scene.

574
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,100
But you are really good.

575
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,500
Thank you dahling!

576
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,400
Hi there!

577
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,700
Who are you?

578
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Betty, can I see you
outside for a minute?

579
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,900
- What is it Coco?
- Your aunt called

580
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,400
I was afraid of that.

581
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,500
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

582
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,700
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

583
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,200
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad ...

584
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,300
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

585
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
I kept telling her
it was my friend Rita ...

586
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,300
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas ...

587
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,500
Look at me straight, sweetie.

588
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:35,600
Coco ... she's very nice.

589
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,500
Honey ... you're a good kid.

590
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,900
What you're telling me
is a load of horse-pucky,

591
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,800
even though it comes
from a good place.

592
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,100
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

593
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,900
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

594
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,200
Louise Bonner says
there's trouble in there.

595
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,200
Remember last night?

596
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,900
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

597
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,400
but if there is trouble
get rid of it.

598
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,000
Is everything all right?

599
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,000
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

600
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,400
No, no, everything is A-okay.

601
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

602
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:27,300
And my audition is in one hour.

603
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,500
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

604
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,700
- Don't drink all the coke.
- Good luck!

605
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.

606
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,700
- Okay.
- Okay?

607
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,000
Voilà!

608
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,000
Betty Elms,
I'd like you to meet ...

609
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,200
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

610
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,100
Woody Katz who we've
cast in the part ...

611
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,300
of "Chuck".
He'll do the scene with you.

612
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,300
Bob Brooker, the director,

613
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,100
and Julie Chadwick ...

614
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,600
Now, our surprise guest is:

615
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,900
Linney James.

616
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,200
Alas we can't afford
her to cast our show,

617
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,100
but as casting agents go ...

618
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,800
she's the best.

619
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,900
Why thank you, Wally.
Hello Betty.

620
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,900
Very pleased to meet you.

621
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,900
This is my assistant, Nicki.

622
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,200
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

623
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,300
Martha Johnson, who
you met out front.

624
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,800
Hi.

625
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,300
So shall we get it to go?

626
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,000
Would you like a water or a coffee
before we begin?

627
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,000
No, no, I'm fine.

628
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:31,300
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

629
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,900
Betty, why don't you join Woody over
there and we'll play the scene.

630
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,800
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say ...

631
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,900
something to Betty before we begin?

632
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,100
No ... it's not a contest,

633
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:54,800
the two of them with themselves,

634
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,700
so don't play it for real ...

635
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,400
until it gets real.

636
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,000
Okay.

637
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,600
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

638
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,800
What?

639
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Hey Bobby, I want to play
this one nice and close,

640
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,000
like we did with that other girl,

641
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,800
what's her name? The one with the
black hair. That felt kinda good.

642
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,500
- Whaddya think?
- That's good, Woody.

643
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,100
Just don't rush that line again.

644
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:28,800
I told you ... the line where
you say, "Before what?"

645
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,600
Bobby, acting is reacting ...

646
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,200
I just play off 'em. They all say:

647
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,200
"They're gonna arrest you" like that ...

648
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,300
"put you in jail" ...
They all say it the same way,

649
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,800
so I react like that.

650
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
What's your name?
- Betty

651
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,800
Yeah ... Betty, look ... You don't rush it.
I don't rush it.

652
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,800
We're gonna play it
nice and close ...

653
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,400
just like in the movies. OK?

654
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,900
Dad's best friend goes to work.

655
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,900
And ... ACTION!

656
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,900
You're still here?

657
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,400
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

658
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,700
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

659
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,100
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

660
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,400
So ... surprise!

661
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,900
I can call them ...
I can call my dad ...

662
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,200
But you won't ...

663
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:55,800
You're playing a
dangerous game here ...

664
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,900
if you're trying to blackmail me ...

665
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:02,600
it's not gonna work.

666
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,300
You know what I want..

667
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,000
it's not that difficult.

668
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,600
Get out ...

669
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,400
Get out before I call my dad.

670
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,800
He trusts you ...

671
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
You're ...

672
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,400
his best friend.

673
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:32,100
This will be the end of everything.

674
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,200
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

675
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,900
Stop ...

676
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,200
stop it!

677
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,000
That's what you said
from the beginning.

678
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,200
If I tell them what happened ...
they'll arrest you ...

679
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,800
and put you in jail,

680
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,500
so get out of here ...

681
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,600
before ...

682
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,900
Before what?

683
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,500
Before ...

684
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,200
I kill you.

685
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,500
Then they'd put you in jail.

686
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:01,400
I hate you ...

687
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,200
I hate us both!

688
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,000
- I'm going to take her over there.
- Yeah big time!

689
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,400
Wow! Well, there it was.

690
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,900
There it was all right!

691
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:36,400
Baby, you got away with it!

692
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,300
Very good. Really.

693
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,000
I mean it was forced maybe ...

694
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,100
but still humanistic.

695
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,100
Yeah,

696
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,100
very good,

697
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,500
really.

698
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,700
Oh I thank you Betty ...

699
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,400
and I really mean that sincerely.

700
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,600
I mean, it was extraordinary.

701
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,400
You've done your Aunt proud ...

702
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,600
and I'm going to tell her
the first chance I get.

703
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,100
Now, you and I ...

704
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,100
are gonna speak again soon.

705
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,500
Thank you Mr. Brown.

706
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,500
Thank you, Wally.

707
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,900
I'm sure you all have a lot to
talk about. We'll walk Betty out.

708
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,900
Well, yes indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

709
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,500
Don't you be a stranger around here.

710
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,700
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

711
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,500
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

712
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:44,100
It was nice meeting all of you.

713
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,300
Wow!

714
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,300
How do you find her ...

715
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,000
God, that was awful!

716
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,700
Not you Betty.
You were stellar and I mean that.

717
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,500
But poor Wally.

718
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,700
He'll never get that picture made.
- Why?

719
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,100
Wally's days were up 20 years ago.

720
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,300
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor?

721
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
And the cast is terrible ...

722
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,600
Oh, God, terrible

723
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,000
Poor old fool Wally ...

724
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,000
It was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

725
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,100
and Wally ... Mr. Brown ... is a
very close friend of my Aunt's, so ...

726
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,100
Settle down, Betty.
Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

727
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,800
I ought to. I was married
to him for ten years.

728
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,900
And I love actors, all actors.

729
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,200
We just get a little catty sometimes.

730
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,900
Now we want to take you across
and introduce you to a director ...

731
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,900
who's a head above the rest

732
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,900
He's got a project
that you would kill!

733
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,700
Knock it right out of the park.

734
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,600
Cut it! Thank you very
much, Carol. I'm coming back.

735
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,000
Checking the gate?
Checking the gate!

736
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,000
Thank you!
Will tell you what happens next!

737
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Thank you very much, for coming in
I know how busy you are.

738
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,500
Oh, are you kidding me? I love
this script! Show me where to sign!

739
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,500
Look ... I love you ...

740
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,200
but there's no way they're gonna let me
cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

741
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,200
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

742
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,300
cause my manager's gonna be bugging
you day and night ... and me.

743
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,700
- It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here.
- Oh, you're just so cruel to me ...

744
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,100
don't forget me. I'm the girl
that's going to play this part.

745
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:14,600
See ya later.

746
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,900
Hank ... where's Hank?

747
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,800
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

748
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,000
- Is she ready?
- Already.

749
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:28,200
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes next.

750
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,800
Sylvia North's story,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

751
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,500
Ok, here we go ...
Let's lock it up, please!

752
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,000
- Roll sound please ...
- That's it!

753
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,800
Playback!
ACTION!

754
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,800
Get Jason over here.

755
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:23,100
Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.

756
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,600
Did you want
to tell me something, Adam?

757
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,900
This is the girl!

758
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,100
Excellent choice, Adam.

759
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,400
Oh ... my goodness.

760
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,900
I have to be somewhere.

761
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,200
I promised a friend.

762
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,100
I'm sorry. I must go ...

763
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,900
It should be around here ...

764
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,500
2590 ... That's it.

765
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,300
Up there!

766
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,000
- Does it look familiar?
- No.

767
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,100
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?!

768
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:44,700
- Those men in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?!

769
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,100
No ... but ...
- Keep going.

770
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,800
Go around to the back.

771
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,900
Selwyn ... number 12.

772
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,600
Now, you've got me scared.

773
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:35,000
See, I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of!

774
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:39,400
Betty wait ... wait

775
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,400
Oh no ... don't.

776
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,500
No one's home.

777
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,000
Yes?

778
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:21,600
Number 17.

779
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,800
But it said number 12.

780
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,800
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

781
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,400
It's down in the end on the left.

782
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,700
She hasn't been around
for a few days ...

783
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:46,100
- Oh ... we'll leave her a note.
- I'll go with you.

784
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,600
She's still got some of my stuff.

785
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,600
You go ahead.
I've got to get that.

786
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:16,000
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

787
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,800
Guess I'm not.

788
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,700
Still no one's home I guess.

789
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,300
- What are you doing?
- C'mon!

790
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,300
C'mon help me in. Come on.

791
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,000
I'll open the front door.

792
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:43,700
C'mon.

793
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,400
I know what you're doing.

794
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:40,600
I know what you have to do,

795
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,700
but let me do it.

796
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,700
Let me do it.

797
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,300
You look like someone else.

798
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,200
Good night, Betty.

799
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,300
You don't wear it in the house.

800
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,400
What?

801
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,400
The wig.

802
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:55,800
Just I'm looking
at myself again ...

803
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,700
I'll take it off to sleep.

804
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,200
And you don't have
to sleep on that couch.

805
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,500
No, it's okay.

806
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,600
No it's not. This is a huge bed.

807
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:09,400
C'mon, just get in and
get a good night sleep.

808
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,900
It's more comfortable
than the couch, isn't it?

809
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:47,000
Yes.

810
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,700
Thank you, Betty.

811
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,700
It's nothing.

812
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,100
I shouldn't have let you sleep
on the couch last night.

813
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,900
No ... I mean ...

814
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:07,500
Thank you for everything.

815
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,800
You're welcome.

816
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:24,900
Good night, sweet Betty.

817
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,600
Good night.

818
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:21,100
Have you ever done this before?

819
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,600
I don't know!

820
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,900
Have you?

821
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:43,100
I want to with you ...

822
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:11,600
I'm in love with you.

823
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,700
I'm in love with you.

824
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,300
Silencio.

825
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:01,000
Silencio.

826
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:04,500
Silencio.

827
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,500
No hay banda.

828
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:12,400
No hay banda.

829
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,700
No hay orquestra.

830
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:26,100
Silencio.

831
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,900
Silencio.

832
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,600
Silencio.

833
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:37,000
Rita?
- No hay banda.

834
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,400
Rita, wake up.

835
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,400
- No, no ...
- It's ok, it's ok.

836
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,400
No it's not ok.

837
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,500
What's wrong?

838
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,200
Go with me somewhere ...

839
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,500
It's 2 o'clock.
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

840
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:06,100
Go with me somewhere ...

841
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,400
Sure. Now?

842
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,800
Right now!

843
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,400
No hay banda!

844
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:55,200
There is no band!

845
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:59,300
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

846
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,200
This is all ...

847
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,100
a tape-recording.

848
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,300
No hay banda!

849
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:11,800
and yet we hear a band.

850
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:15,300
If we want to hear a clarinette ...

851
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,100
listen ...

852
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:28,800
Un trombon "à coulisse".

853
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:35,400
Un trombon "con sordina".

854
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:42,500
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

855
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:48,000
Hear le son ...

856
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:53,100
and mute it ... drop it ...

857
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,800
It's all recorded.

858
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,400
No hay banda!

859
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:24,400
It's all a tape.

860
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:36,400
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

861
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,900
It is ...

862
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,700
an illusion.

863
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,900
Listen ...

864
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,300
Senoras y senores ...

865
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:10,600
el club Silencio les presenta
la llorona de Los Angeles:

866
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:15,300
Rebekah del Rio.

867
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,900
Betty?

868
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,700
Betty?

869
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,800
Donde estas?

870
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,300
Betty?

871
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,800
Hey, pretty little girl ...

872
01:57:02,100 --> 01:57:05,500
time to wake up.

873
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:44,500
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

874
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,300
My lamp and dishes ...

875
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:53,300
C'mon Diane, it's been 3 weeks.

876
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,500
I put your dishes in that box.

877
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:21,900
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

878
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:34,100
Anytime ...

879
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:38,500
I'm just making sure, Diane.

880
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,600
- This is it?
- Yeah

881
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:59,400
Ah, by the way, those two detectives
came by again, looking for you.

882
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,300
Camilla!

883
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,900
You've come back!

884
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:43,900
What was that you
were saying, beautiful?

885
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,200
I said:

886
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:49,900
"You drive me wild".

887
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:05,100
We shouldn't do this anymore ...

888
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:13,600
Don't say that ...

889
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:20,400
Don't ever say that!

890
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:22,600
Don't Diane,

891
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,700
Stop it ...
Diane STOP!

892
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:30,900
I've tried to tell you this before.

893
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:42,300
It's him, isn't it?

894
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:54,400
I'm not trying to show
you how to do the scene.

895
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,100
Just watch me ...

896
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:00,900
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

897
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:06,500
Don't seat so rigid ...

898
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:10,000
just, just relax ...

899
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,100
The two of you are alone ...

900
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,900
and it's real comfortable ...

901
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,700
like you've known
each other forever ...

902
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:23,100
even if you don't say anything ...
It's real comfortable.

903
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,800
Hank, can you just clear the set ...

904
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,500
there's too many people around here ...
Let's get this worked out ...

905
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,100
Clear the set! Clear the set!

906
02:04:31,300 --> 02:04:34,100
Everyone get a cup of coffee.

907
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:37,500
- Everyone please!
- Can Diane stay?

908
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:43,800
Yes, true. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

909
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:50,400
Now when she starts to cry ...

910
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:54,100
don't pull her toward you.

911
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:57,300
Let her fall in to you ...

912
02:04:57,500 --> 02:05:01,000
Let her fall.

913
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,500
When you kiss her ...

914
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:11,000
It's just a continuation of that move.

915
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:14,800
There is no break ...

916
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:42,400
Kill the lights!

917
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:52,400
Don't be mad!

918
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:55,800
- Don't make it be like this!
- Oh, sure.

919
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:58,600
You want me to make
this easy for you? No!

920
02:05:58,900 --> 02:06:02,000
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

921
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:06,200
It's not easy for me!

922
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:30,500
Hello, it's me ...

923
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:33,900
leave a message ...

924
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:44,300
Hello?

925
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:50,000
Diane, the car is waiting.

926
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,000
Are you ok?

927
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,400
You comin'?

928
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,700
Good ...

929
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:04,800
It means so much to me.

930
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:08,700
Go on ... the car is
right outside the house..

931
02:08:08,900 --> 02:08:12,400
It's been waiting, ok?

932
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,700
Ok.

933
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:22,700
It's 6980, Mulholland Drive.

934
02:08:22,900 --> 02:08:26,400
Mulholland Drive.

935
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:39,300
What are you doing?
We don't stop here ...

936
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,400
A surprise ...

937
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:11,100
Shortcut.

938
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:14,800
C'mon sweetheart.

939
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:21,700
It's beautiful.

940
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,400
A secret path.

941
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:34,600
Ah, perfect timing!

942
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:38,200
Welcome, Diane.

943
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,900
Well ...

944
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:48,800
Here's to love ...

945
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,700
Here's to love ...

946
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:07,000
Ah, here she is ...

947
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:18,600
I don't believe
you met my mother ...

948
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:21,000
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

949
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:23,800
Just call me Coco,
everybody does ...

950
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,100
- Pleased to meet you ...
- Let's eat ...

951
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:29,500
I'm starving ...

952
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:38,300
I'm sorry, I was late.

953
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,200
I'm from Deep River, Ontario ...

954
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,200
a small town.

955
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:06,900
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

956
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:10,600
I've always wanted to come here.

957
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:14,200
I won this jitterbug contest ...

958
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:17,900
that sort of led to acting ...

959
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:22,200
you know, wanting to act.

960
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:25,800
When my aunt died ...

961
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:30,500
anyway, she left me so money ...
she worked here ...

962
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,400
In the movies?

963
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:36,000
Yes.

964
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:40,200
How did you meet Camilla?

965
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,600
On a "Sylvia North Story".

966
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,200
Camilla was great in that.

967
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,100
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

968
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:08,300
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

969
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:12,600
The director ...

970
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:15,000
Bob Brooker?

971
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,100
Yes.

972
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:22,800
He didn't think so much of me ...

973
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:30,400
anyway, that's when
we became friends.

974
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,400
She helped me ...

975
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:37,700
getting some parts
in some of her films.

976
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:41,200
I see.

977
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:57,300
So, I got the pool ...

978
02:14:57,500 --> 02:15:01,100
and she got the pool-man.

979
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:07,400
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

980
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:16,200
Sometimes good things happen.

981
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,600
So, I guess we saved
the best for last ...

982
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:15,800
Do you want to tell them?

983
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:19,500
No, you to tell them.

984
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:25,700
Camilla and I ...

985
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:40,200
are going to be ...

986
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:53,700
Sorry about that.

987
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,900
No, I'm fine.

988
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:12,100
This is the girl.

989
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,700
Don't show me
this photo-thing here.

990
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:20,400
It's just an actress' photo,
everybody's got one.

991
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:23,100
You got the money?

992
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:26,500
Sure do.

993
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:42,100
Ok, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

994
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:47,800
Are you sure you want this?

995
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:54,900
More than anything in this world.

996
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:08,200
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

997
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,300
What's it open?

705
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:44,600
