片名:穆赫兰道

3
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,019
你在干吗? 我们不该在这停呀
What are you doing? We don't stop here.

4
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,379
下车
Get out of the car.

5
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,540
那些家伙在车后找到的
The boys found this on the floor, in the back of the Caddy.

6
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,999
恩 我看过了
Yeah, they showed me.

7
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,600
可能和案子没关系
Could be unrelated.

8
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,399
可能吧
Could be.

9
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,380
死者中有戴珍珠项链的吗?
Any of those dead kids wearing pearl earrings?

10
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,179
没有
No.

11
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,569
可能是其他人落下的
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

12
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,829
我也是这么想
That what I'm thinking.

13
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,049
就剩一个包了
Just one more bag after that.

14
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,649
维奇斯餐馆 (日落大道)

15
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,679
我只想来这
I just wanted to come here.

16
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,189
来维奇斯餐馆?
To Winkie's?

17
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,449
只是这间
This Winkie's.

18
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,219
为什么偏认准这间?
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

19
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,059
有点难以启齿
It's kind of embarrassing.

20
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,759
说吧
Go ahead.

21
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,920
我做了个与此地有关的梦 是吗?
I had a dream about this place. Oh, boy.

22
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,649
明白我的意思吗?
See what I mean?

23
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,399
是的 你做了个与此地有关的梦
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

24
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,799
然后呢
Tell me.

25
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,589
我是第二次做这个梦了 两次都是一样的
it's the second one I've had. But they're both the same.

26
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,540
梦的开始是我来到这儿...
They start out that I'm in here but...

27
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,049
当时既不是白天也不是晚上...
it's not day or night...

28
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,320
半黑半白的 明白吗?
it's kind of half-night, you know?

29
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,280
除了这些灯光外
But it looks just like this.

30
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,289
周围环境就像现在这样
Except for the light.

31
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:38,990
我说不出来的害怕...
And I'm scared like I can't tell you. Of all people...

32
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,569
你就站在那边
you're standing right over there.

33
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,609
站在柜台旁
By that counter.

34
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,979
两次梦里都有你 而且你都是一副受惊吓的样子
You're in both dreams and you're scared.

35
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,609
看到你吓成那样 我更害怕...
I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are, and...

36
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,219
然后我意识到是怎么回事了
then I realize what it is.

37
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,139
有一个男人...
There's a man...

38
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,159
在这个地方后面
in back of this place

39
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,829
就是被他吓的
He's the one who's doing it.

40
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,600
我可以透过墙看见他
I can see him through the wall.

41
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,779
我可以看见他的脸
I can see his face.

42
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
我希望永远不会在现实中看见那张脸
I hope that I never see that face ever outside of the dream.

43
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,280
就是这样了
That's it.

44
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,279
所以...你来这看他是否存在
So...you came to see if he's out there.

45
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,609
为了消除这种恐惧感
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

46
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,649
好的
Right then.

47
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,539
他就在这附近
It's around the back.

48
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,809
丹 你没事吧
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

49
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,529
还是没找到那女孩
The girl is still missing.

50
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,000
说吧
Talk to me.

51
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,889
没什么变化
The same.

52
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,939
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

53
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,429
该说再见了 贝蒂
Well, it's time to say good-bye, Betty.

54
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,200
-旅途中有你做伴真不错 -谢谢
-It's been so nice traveling with you. -Thank you, Irene.

55
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,170
我好兴奋好紧张 和你聊天真的很开心
I was so excited and nervous. It was sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,660
-记住 我要在大荧幕上看到你 -好的
-I'll watch for you on the big screen. -Okay, Irene.

57
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,810
会有那么一天吗
Won't that be the day?

58
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,280
祝你好运 亲爱的贝蒂
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,670
-保重 -我会的
-Take care of yourself and be careful. -I will.

60
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,890
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,100
贝蒂 很高兴见到你 祝你好运
Betty, it was so nice meeting you. All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,689
谢谢
Thank you.

63
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,760
我的包呢?
My bags?

64
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,229
要去哪?
Where to?

65
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,379
哈文赫特1612号
1612, Hayvenhurst.

66
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,739
知道
Got it.

67
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,440
我打赌你就是贝蒂
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

68
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,270
是的
Yes.

69
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,299
-你是莲露莉斯夫人吧? -是的 宝贝
-It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it? -In all my living glory, baby.

70
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,600
很高兴见到你 叫我可可就行了 别人都这么叫我
Pleased to meet you. Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

71
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,929
-在这等等 我要去拿钥匙 -好的 可可
-Wait there and I'll go get the key. -Okay, Coco.

72
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,580
维金斯
Wilkins!

73
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,830
维金斯
Wilkins!

74
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,520
如果那该死的狗再在大院里拉屎的话...
If that damn dog craps in the courtyard one more time...

75
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,640
-我就把它烤来做早餐 -你没养宠物吧
-I'm just gonna bank his little butt for breakfast! -You don't have any pets?

76
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,550
没有 虽然是合法的
No, I don't. They're allowed.

77
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,720
但我真的不喜欢这儿有宠物
I just don't like them in here for obvious reasons.

78
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,870
这儿曾经住过一个男人
There was a man that lived here once that

79
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,410
他养了一只袋鼠
had a prizefighting kangaroo.

80
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,799
你想象不到那只袋鼠 在这院子里做了些什么
You just wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

81
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,190
一起去看看你姨妈的房子吧 挺不错的
Let's go see your aunt's apartment. It's a good one.

82
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,139
我等不及了
I can hardly wait.

83
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,549
真难以置信! 我告诉过你
It's unbelievable! I told you.

84
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,260
你姨妈事先应该交待清楚了 这是钥匙
You and your aunt probably have an understanding, so here's the key.

85
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,940
需要什么尽管跟我说
And if you need anything, just give a holler.

86
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,620
这儿的人和我关系很好
Everybody in this building is pretty much okay with me...

87
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,230
否则他们也不会住这了
or they wouldn't be here.

88
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,640
如果你愿意 迟点会介绍你们认识
If you like, later on I'll introduce you around.

89
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,239
如果不愿意的话也别勉强
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

90
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,370
对不起 露茜姨妈没说过这还有人
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell me someone was gonna be here.

91
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,400
-很对不起 -没关系
-I'm so sorry. -It's okay.

92
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,779
我是露茜的侄女 我叫贝蒂 她应该说过我会来吧?
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

93
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,630
出了点意外 我才在这的
There was an accident. I came here.

94
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,169
我明白 我看到衣服了
I understand. I saw the dress.

95
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,189
对不起 你没事吧?
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

96
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,009
发生什么事了?
What happened?

97
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,069
一起车...
A car...

98
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,089
车祸
a car accident.

99
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,129
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

100
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,479
没事
I think so.

101
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,119
我只是...
I was just...

102
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,640
在洗澡
taking a shower.

103
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,530
不好意思 你继续洗吧
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that.

104
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,889
我去整理行李
I'm gonna get unpacked.

105
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,709
你叫什么名字?
What's your name?

106
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,349
不好意思 我还是出去吧 稍后再谈
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here. We can talk later.

107
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,299
我叫...
My name is...

108
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,449
丽塔
Rita.

109
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,109
你是我姨妈的同事吗?
Do you work with my aunt?

110
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,680
不 我...不好意思
No, I...I'm sorry...

111
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,819
是我多事了
it's none of my business.

112
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,469
她那头红发真漂亮
She has pretty red hair.

113
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,250
她正在加拿大拍电影
She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...

114
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,540
叫我来这住 估计你都知道的吧
that's being made in Canada, but I guess you already know that.

115
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,869
我一辈子也买不起这种地方
I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years.

116
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,220
除非我能成为电影明星
Unless, of course, I'm discovered and become a movie star.

117
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,420
当然 我更愿意做个演技派 而不是靠脸蛋
Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star...

118
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,870
不过有些人是两者兼备的
but sometimes people end up being both. So...

119
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:46,239
这就是我来这儿的目的
that is, I guess you'd say, the story of why I came here.

120
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,860
不好意思 我太兴奋了
I'm sorry. I'm just so excited to be here.

121
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,349
我刚从安大略湖的深河镇来 现在我终于来到这个...
I just came here from Deep River, Ontario, and now I'm in this...

122
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,279
梦一般的地方 能体会我的感受吗?
dream place! Well, you can imagine how I feel.

123
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,139
坐下吧
Sit down.

124
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,529
你哪里受伤了?
Where were you hurt?

125
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,100
-我们得叫个医生来 -不要
-We should call a doctor. -No.

126
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,940
-可能挺严重的 -不 我想睡觉
-But this could be serious. -No, I need to sleep.

127
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,370
如果是脑震荡 你不能睡觉的
If you have a concussion, you shouldn't sleep.

128
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,950
我睡会就没事了
I'll be okay if I sleep.

129
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,489
我只想躺下睡觉
I just need to lie down here and sleep.

130
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:41,060
亚当 我们想提些建议...
You see, Adam, there are some suggestions that ought to be brought forward.

131
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,300
你说过愿意接受意见的
And I know you said you would entertain suggestions.

132
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,399
大家都希望你能这么做
And that's all anybody here is asking you to do.

133
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,369
你在说什么? 思路要开放一些
What are you talking about? An open mind.

134
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,959
你在重新挑选女主角 因此我们...
You're in the process of recasting your lead actress, and I'm...

135
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,939
我们希望你思路能开放一些
we are asking you to keep an open mind.

136
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,459
上次的是什么?
What was it the last time?

137
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,599
好的 试试下一位 他不会喜欢的
Okay, let's try the next one. He's not gonna like it.

138
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,889
走着瞧吧

219
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,710
电影明星通常都这样
like a regular movie star.

220
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,500
在这见到你的朋友丽塔 真让我大吃一惊

229
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,929

I'm sure there's some explanation for this. I don't think we have to do that.

230

I thought you knew my aunt and that's why you were here.

234

我刚和姨妈通过电话 她想让我报警
I just talked to my aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police.

我以为睡一觉醒来...我以为睡一觉就没事了
I thought when I woke up...I thought sleep would do it.

239
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,709

244
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,819

This is your purse. Your name must be in your purse.

245
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,029
你也想知道的 对吗?

277
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,090
拜托你到办公室来 我们肯定能做些什么的
Please, come to the office. There's gotta be something we can do!

278
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,039
我要回家
I'm going home.

279
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,909
我在想你要去哪
I wonder where you were going.

280
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,349
穆赫兰道
Mulholland Drive.

281
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,229
穆赫兰道?
Mulholland Drive?

282
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,649
那就是我要去的地方
That's where I was going.

283
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,789
穆赫兰道
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:21,199
也许车祸就发生在那
Maybe that's where the accident was.

285
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,099
警察局一定会有记录的 我们打个电话问问
There must be a police report. We could call.

286
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,869
我们到外面用公用电话打 确定下是否出过车祸
We could call anonymously just to see if there was an accident.

287
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,229
就像电影里的桥段 我们也像电影里的角色一样
It'll be just like in the movies! We'll pretend to be someone else.

288
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,030
反正我也想出去走走
I wanna walk around, anyway.

289
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,769
身在好莱坞 却没好好看过它呢
I'm in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any of it.

290
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,189
来吧 丽塔 你去吗?
Come on, Rita, do you feel up to it?

291
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,620
好的
Okay.

292
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,909
只是...
But just...

293
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,370
只是去搞清楚
just to see.

294
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,620
只是去搞清楚...
Just to see if there was an accident...

295
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,249
在穆赫兰道是否出过车祸
on Mulholland Drive.

296
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,509
洛兰尼
Lorraine?

297
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,989
你在家吗
You're home?

298
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,899
洛兰尼?
Lorraine?

299
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,889
现在你都看到了
Now you've done it!

300
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,559
忘了吧 这样比较明智
Just forget you ever saw it. It's better that way.

301
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,379
你到底想干什么?
What the hell are you even doing here?

302
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:49,779
你干什么?
What are you doing?

303
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,379
那是我的珠宝
That's my jewelry!

304
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,089
你这杂种 他很郁闷 洛兰尼
That bastard. You bastard! He's probably upset, Lorraine.

305
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,689
你干什么?
What are you doing?

306
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,240
住手
Stop it!

307
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,980
住手
Stop it!

308
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,849
亚当 住手
Adam, stop it!

309
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,750
住手
Stop it!

310
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,099
住手
Stop it!

311
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,950
你弄痛我了 杰里
You're hurting me! Gene!

312
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,899
你弄痛我了
You're hurting me!

313
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,719
别这么对你老婆 我就不在乎我老婆怎么做
That ain't no way to treat your wife. I don't care what she's done.

314
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,790
把他扔出去
Throw him out!

315
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,489
把他扔出去
Throw him out!

316
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,319
去你的 亚当
Damn you, Adam!

317
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,679
把他扔出去
Throw him out!

318
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,709
滚
Get out!

319
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,219
我们先把它藏起来
Let's hide it.

320
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,469
那有一个
There's one.

321
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,440
好莱坞警察局 我想询问一下...
Los Angeles Police Department. I'm inquiring about an accident...

322
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,430
昨晚在穆赫兰道上发生的车祸
last night on Mulholland Drive.

323
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,759
请稍等 我帮你转到交通科
I'll connect you to Traffic.

324
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,359
-我是白斯特警官 -我想问一下...
-Sergeant Baker. -Hi, I'm inquiring...

325
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,110
昨晚我听到了点声音 好像是撞车
I heard a sound last night that sounded sort of like a car crash.

326
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,140
穆赫兰道上是否发生了车祸?
I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

327
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,400
是的 是发生了车祸
Yes, there was.

328
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,530
-能告诉我出了什么事吗? -不行
-Can you tell me what happened? -No, I can't.

329
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,269
-有人受伤吗? -能告诉我你的名字吗?
-Was anyone hurt? -May I have your name, please?

330
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,500
是有一起车祸
There was an accident.

331
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,139
他不肯多说 应该就是你遇到的那起
He wouldn't tell me anything else, but that was your accident, Rita.

332
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,710
或许报纸上会有相关的报道
Maybe there's something about it in the papers.

333
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,889
来吧 我们一边喝咖啡 一边看报纸去
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee and we can see.

334
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:54,900
可能发生得太晚了 今天的报纸没报道
Maybe it happened so late it's not in today's paper.

335
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,119
什么都没有吗?
There's nothing?

336
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,679
我没找到
Not that I can see.

337
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,739
没关系的
That's okay.

338
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,239
谢谢
Thanks.

339
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,649
戴安妮
Diane.

340
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,919
就这些了吗? 可以下单了吗?
Will that be all? Would you like your check?

341
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,739
丽塔 还要点什么吗?
Rita, you want something?

342
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:30,249
不 咖啡就行了 可以下单了
No, just...just the coffee. We'll take our check.

343
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,669
怎么了? 丽塔
What is it, Rita?

344
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:52,099
我想起点东西 我想起点东西
I remember something. I remember something!

345
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:58,790
想起什么了? 戴安妮·西恩
What is it? Diane Selwyn.

346
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,179
我好像就叫这名字
Maybe that's my name!

347
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:09,709
D·西恩 只有一个
D. Selwyn. It's the only one.

348
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,379
打个电话过去
I'm gonna call.

349
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,119
-给自己打电话很奇怪 -不一定是我
-It is strange to be calling yourself. -Maybe it's not me.

350
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,010
你好 是我
Hello, it's me.

351
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,079
请留言
Leave a message.

352
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,329
那不是我的声音
That's not my voice.

353
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:45,399
但我认识她
But I know her!

354
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,720
可能这不是戴安妮·西恩的声音 可能是你室友
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

355
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,019
如果她是戴安妮的话 应该知道你是谁
Or if it is Diane Selwyn, she could tell you who you are.

356
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,690
也许吧
Maybe.

357
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,899
也许 也许
Maybe, maybe...

358
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,849
亚当·克什尔?
Adam Kesher?

359
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,120
-亚当·克什尔? -走开
-Adam Kesher? -Get lost!

360
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,830
-这是亚当·克什尔的房子 -见鬼给我滚出去
-This is Adam Kesher's house. -Like hell it is! Get out now!

361
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,079
滚出去
Get out!

362
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,969
亚当·克什尔
Adam Kesher?

363
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,909
滚开 他再也不会回来的了
Get out of here! He's never coming back! Ever!

364
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,310
估计你听不懂英语吧!
Bastard. I guess you don't understand English.

365
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,570
她叫你离开 门在那
She said leave. Here's the door.

366
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:10,450
杰里
Gene!

367
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,799
滚开
Get out!

368
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,999
滚开
Get out!

369
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,869
亚当·克什尔
Adam Kesher?

370
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,730
-什么事? 科基 -很抱歉 克什尔先生...
-Yeah, what is it, Cookie? -I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

371
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:49,239
你的信用卡似乎有点问题
but there seems to be some problem with your credit cards.

372
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:52,439
什么? 我给你现金吧 科基
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

373
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:58,569
银行的两个家伙来过这
Listen, two guys from your bank came by.

374
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,029
银行?
My bank?

375
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:04,789
-他们怎么知道我在这 -我不知道
-How'd they know I was here? -I don't know.

376
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,420
他们说了些什么?
What'd they say?

377
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,310
他们说你的帐户已经没钱了
They said to tell you that you're maxed out at your bank...

378
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,569
你的信用卡被取消了
and that your line of credit has been canceled.

379
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,369
真难以置信
That's unbelievable.

380
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:22,739
我...
Well, look...

381
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,119
我不知道发生了什么事 一群胡说八道的家伙
I don't know what's going on. That is so much baloney.

382
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,399
-我有大把现金 科基 -我知道 不要担心
-I got enough cash for you, Cookie. -I know, I know. Don't worry.

383
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:44,209
我很抱歉 不过我有义务提醒你...
But I'm sorry, it's my duty to inform you...

384
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:50,480
小心点 不管你躲在哪...
listen, man, whoever you're hiding from...

385
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,149
他们都能找到你
they know where you are.

386
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,079
好的
Right.

387
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,069
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

388
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,060
喂
Hello?

389
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,020
-有人冻结了我的银行帐户 -我知道了 你在哪? 亚当
-Someone maybe shut off my money. -I know. Where are you, Adam?

390
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,580
-你知道了是什么意思? -有人打电话找过你...
-Sorry, what do you mean you know? -Somebody called...

391
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,779
他们说你已破产了 我不信 所以我打了几个电话
they told me you were as good as broke. So I made a few calls.

392
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,470
-然后呢? -你确实破产了
-And? -You're broke.

393
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,819
我没破产
I'm not broke!

394
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,639
但你确实破产了 你在哪?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

395
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:51,679
我在市区 科基这儿 你认识一个叫"牛仔"的人吗?
I'm at Cookie's, downtown. Do you know somebody called "The Cowboy"?

396
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,979
-牛仔? -是的
-"The cowboy"? -Yeah.

397
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:00,030
牛仔 这个人想见你
"The Cowboy". This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you.

398
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,059
杰森觉得应该去见他
Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

399
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,380
杰森认为我该去见牛仔吗?
Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

400
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,100
我是不是要带上 高顶宽边呢帽和左轮手枪?
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat and my six-shooters?

401
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,329
某些迹象表明 他与所发生的事有联系
Something tells me that this guy is connected to what's happening.

402
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,350
亚当 你应该去见他 马上去
Adam, I think you should do it, and you should do it right away.

403
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:24,249
出了什么事? 辛西娅 真是怪异的一天
What's going on, Cynthia? It's been a very strange day.

404
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,239
而且越来越奇怪
And getting stranger.

405
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,259
我到哪和这位牛仔碰头? 要不要我骑着马去?
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you have to ride out to the range?

406
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,900
你真搞笑 如果要找他的话...
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on...

407
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:44,470
到比奇伍德峡谷的顶上 那里有个围栏...
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood Canyon, there's a corral up there...

408
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:48,220
-他在那等你 -你在戏弄我?
-where he'll be. -You've gotta be kidding me.

409
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,690
你去不去?
Will you meet with him?

410
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:52,120
当然去
Yeah.

411
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,500
-今天真不是什么吉日 -什么时候?
-Sure. This has been that kind of a day. -When?

412
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:00,249
我马上致电他 然后再通知你
I'll call him right away and then I'll call you back.

413
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,690
如果你愿意 可以来我这里
You know, you could stay at my place, if you wanted.

414
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:11,050
-我觉得不妥 -只是让你落落脚而已
-I don't think that'd be a good idea. -I was just offering a place to stay.

415
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:14,560
非常感激 我自己会找地方的
Yes, and I appreciate the offer, Cynthia. I'll find a place.

416
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,760
快去给牛仔打电话 然后答复我
Just go on and give that cowboy a yodel and get on back to me.

417
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,520
好 我怕你什么地方可能会疏忽
Okay. But you don't know what you're missing.

418
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,479
别管了 小亲亲 我等你电话
Just get along, little doggie. And call me back.

419
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,689
大概就在这附近了 塞丽亚泊尼塔 不是很远
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita. It's not too far away.

420
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,339
有什么问题吗?
What's wrong with that?

421
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,509
我不能肯定是这儿
I'm not sure about this.

422
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:51,969
我知道你有点害怕
I know you're afraid of something.

423
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,579
我保证一定小心行事
We'll be careful. I promise.

424
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:02,099
等明天我们去了 就知道是不是那了
Tomorrow. We'll go over there.and we'll find out.

425
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,529
没事的
It'll be okay.

426
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,299
可能是可可
It's probably Coco.

427
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,299
-什么事? 需要帮忙吗? -有人要倒霉了
-Yes, may I help you? -Someone is in trouble!

428
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,409
你是谁?
Who are you?

429
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:38,380
你在露茜的家里做什么?
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

430
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,940
她让我呆在这的 我是她的侄女 我叫贝蒂
She's letting me stay here. I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

431
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,569
不 不是的 她不是这样说的
No, it's not! That's not what she said.

432
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,249
有人倒霉了 大事不好了
Someone is in trouble! Something bad is happening!

433
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:55,750
抱歉我不认识你 而且...
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are and...

434
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,149
露易斯 你在干什么? 露易斯
Louise? What are you doing, Louise?

435
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:04,650
我下午3点一直在找你
I've been trying to get hold of you since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

436
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:08,100
那人在我房间 她不肯走
That one is in my room and she won't leave!

437
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:11,159
我要你赶她走 马上赶她走
I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now.

438
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,330
这位是露易斯·波尼尔 她没有恶意的
This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she meant well.

439
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:18,500
露易斯 这位是贝蒂 露茜的侄女
Louise, this is Betty, this is Ruth's niece.

440
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:23,960
正好我要来看贝蒂 贝蒂是个演员
I was on my way over here to see Betty. Betty is a young actress.

441
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,210
我来给她送明天试镜台词
I was delivering some faxed pages of a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

442
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:31,240
-给你 甜心 -谢谢
-Well, here they are, honey. -Thank you.

443
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,840
走吧 露易斯 我带你回家
Come along now, Louise. I'll take you home.

444
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,070
-我很抱歉 这种事时有发生 -没关系
-I'm sorry. It happens sometimes. -Come on.

445
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:39,450
不 她说了有人要倒霉
No, she said it was someone else who was in trouble.

446
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,339
住口 我带你回家 快点
Stop it, Louise! I'm taking you home. Come on.

447
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,709
-晚安 贝蒂 -晚安
-Good night, Betty. -Good night.

448
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,529
晚安
Good night.

449
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,559
牛仔...
Cowboy...

450
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:41,039
您好 您好
Howdy. Howdy to you.

451
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:45,909
很美的夜晚
Beautiful evening.

452
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:55,179
谢谢你从旅馆大老远跑来见我
Thank you for coming all the way up here to see me from that nice hotel downtown.

453
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,050
不要紧 你想怎么样?
No problem. What's on your mind?

454
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:03,869
来了个直肠直肚的人
Well, now. Here's a man who wants to get right down to it.

455
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,430
很好奇 对吗?
Kind of anxious to get to it, are you?

456
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,259
随你怎么说吧
Whatever.

457
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,410
一个人的态度...
A man's attitude...

458
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:18,489
态度决定人生
a man's attitude goes some ways the way his life will be.

459
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,719
你同意吗?
Is that something you might agree with?

460
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,480
当然
Sure!

461
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,510
你是为了讨我欢心...
Did you answer because that's what you thought I wanted to hear...

462
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,770
而言不由衷...
or did you think about what I said...

463
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:35,009
还是确实这么认为的?
and answered 'cause you truly believe that to be right?

464
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:39,499
真心同意您的观点
I agree with what you said. Truly.

465
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,329
我的什么观点?
What'd I say?

466
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,149
态度很大程度上决定人生
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

467
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:54,400
根据我的观点...
So since you agree...

468
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,790
你一定是个不在乎自己过的好不好的人
you must be a person who does not care about the good life.

469
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,699
怎么讲?
How's that?

470
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,810
停下来...
Well, stop for a little second...

471
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:09,669
反省一下吧 拜托你这么做吧
and think about it. Can you do that for me?

472
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,089
好的 我正在反省
Okay. I'm thinking.

473
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:24,139
你根本没在反省 你真的太自以为是了
No, you're not. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinking.

474
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:29,400
现在 我希望你反省 不要再自以为是了
Now, I want you to think and stop being a smart aleck.

475
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,840
拜托你尝试一下
Can you try that for me?

476
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,509
到底怎么回事? 你到底要我怎么做?
Look, where's this going? What do you want me to do?

477
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:41,709
假定有一辆双座车 一辆双座车需要几个司机?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?

478
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,869
一个
One.

479
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:48,050
假设我已经是那个唯一的司机了
So let's just say I'm driving this buggy.

480
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:52,699
如果你态度端正的话 你可以一起乘我的车
And if you fix your attitude, you can ride along with me.

481
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,439
我希望你明天回去上班
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

482
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:04,289
无论如何女主角得重选 多点女孩来试镜
You were recasting the lead actress. Audition many girls for the part.

483
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:10,670
当试到那个女孩时 你得说
When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say:

484
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,970
就是她了
"This is the girl."

485
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:17,609
其他角色人选仍然由你定
The rest of the cast can stay. That's up to you.

486
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,829
但女主角不由你定
But that lead girl is not up to you.

487
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:28,299
表现出色的话 你还能再见我一次
Now, you will see me one more time if you do good.

488
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:34,359
如果干的不好 你还会再见我两次
You'll see me two more times if you do bad.

489
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,579
晚安
Good night.

490
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:06,650
-你还没走 -我又回来了 这不正如你所愿吗?
-You're still here? -I thought that's what you wanted.

491
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,930
-没人想看见你 -真的吗?
-Nobody wants you here! -Really?

492
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:14,170
我父母就在楼上 他们以为你已经走了
My parents are right upstairs. They think you've left!

493
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:18,690
-那又怎样? -很吃惊了 我要叫他们下来 叫我爸下来
-So? -Surprise. I can call them. I can call my dad.

494
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:22,439
你不会的 你威胁我是没有用的
But you won't. If you're trying to blackmail me...

495
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,030
你玩的游戏很危险
it's not going to work! You're playing a dangerous game here.

496
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,680
你知道我想怎么样的 也不是很难满足的
You know what I want. It's not that difficult.

497
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,220
出去 否则我把父亲叫下来
Get out! Get out before I call my dad!

498
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,460
他很信任你 把你当最好的朋友
He trusts you! You're his best friend.

499
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,820
一切都将结束
This will be the end of everything.

500
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,890
你呢? 你父亲会怎么看你?
What about you? What will your dad think about you?

501
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:44,779
不要说了 你一开始就这样说
Stop! Just stop it! That's what you said from the beginning.

502
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,060
如果我把实情告诉他们 你就要去坐牢了
If I tell what happened, they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

503
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,499
请马上离开这 免得我...
Get out of here before...

504
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,880
免得你什么? 免得...
Before what? Before...

505
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:00,469
-我宰了你 -那坐牢的就是你了
-I kill you. -Then they'd put you in jail.

506
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,710
然后我会哭啊哭 接着很动情地说...
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion...

507
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,699
我恨你 我恨我们俩个
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

508
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:17,479
好蹩脚的剧本 不过你真的很棒
Such a lame scene. But you are really good.

509
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,929
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you, darling.

510
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,349
你是谁?
Hi, there. Who are you?

511
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,369
贝蒂
Betty?

512
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:53,179
贝蒂 能到外面聊几句吗?
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

513
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,400
什么事? 可可
What is it, Coco?

514
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,859
你姨妈打电话给我
Your aunt called.

515
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,100
我就担心会这样
I was afraid of that.

516
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,979
她想弄清楚 到底是谁在她家里
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.

517
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:21,020
她不过呆一两个晚上就会走的
It's just for a night or two. Until she finds her own place.

518
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:23,600
我向姨妈解释过的 但当时飞机正在起飞
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth but the connection was bad...

519
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,900
电话线路不是很好 她可能有点误会
and her plane was leaving, and she got it all mixed up.

520
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,960
我说过这是我的朋友丽塔...
I kept telling her that it was my friend Rita...

521
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,239
可她说不认识什么丽塔
and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas.

522
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,780
看着我 甜心 她人很好的
Look at me straight, sweetie. Coco, she's very nice.

523
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,800
甜心 你是个好孩子...
Honey, you're a good kid...

524
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,959
你的话听起来不错...
but what you're telling me is a load of horse puckey.

525
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,100
但我却总觉的不是很踏实
Even though it comes from a good place.

526
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,529
不过 我相信你会处理好这事的
I'm gonna trust you to sort this thing out.

527
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,489
-谢谢 -别让我失望
-Thank you. -Don't make me out to be a sucker.

528
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:55,659
露易斯·波尼尔说过这里要出事 记得吗? 就是昨晚
Louise Bonner said there is trouble in there, remember last night?

529
01:12:56,270 --> 01:13:00,100
她说的不一定对...
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

530
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,369
但如果真有什么麻烦 就得马上解决掉
but if there is trouble, get rid of it.

531
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,240
没事吧?
Is everything all right?

532
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:21,670
-我在这给你添麻烦了吧 -没 一切都挺好的
-Is it bad for you that I'm here? -No, no, everything is A-Okay.

533
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:26,879
我去把三文治弄好 还有一个小时就要试镜了
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich. And my audition is in one hour!

534
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:49,640
两小时后应该能回来
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

535
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,880
-别把可乐都喝光了 -祝你好运
-And don't drink all the Coke. -Good luck.

536
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,769
等我回来后会叫车在外面等着 你准备好
When I get back, I'll keep the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

537
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,160
贝蒂·艾姆斯 给你介绍一下...
Betty Elms, I would like you to meet...

538
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,339
杰克·土特曼 我的助手
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

539
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,740
伍迪·卡特滋 他会和
Woody Katz, who we have cast in the part of Chuck...

540
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,059
你一起表演
and will do the scene with you.

541

以及让人惊喜的嘉宾 里尼·詹姆斯
Now, our surprise guest, Lynne James.

544
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,190
唉 我们请不起她演戏
Alas, we can't afford her to cast our show but...

545
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:58,349
不过挑选演员 她也是最有眼光的
well, as casting agents go, she is the best.

546
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,500
谢谢 沃里 你好 贝蒂
Why, thank you, Wally. Hello, Betty.

你好
Hi.

550
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,479
可以开始了吗?
So, shall we give it a go?

551
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:25,220
要不要先来杯水或是咖啡?
Would you like a water, a coffee before we begin?

552
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,310
不要了
No, I'm fine.

553
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:30,299
好的 那么大家各就各位
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

554
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,700
贝蒂 到伍迪那边去 准备开始了
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there and we'll play the scene.

555
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:46,270
鲍勃 有什么要交待贝蒂的?
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say? Something to Betty before we begin?

556
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:55,319
注意 两个人之间的不是争论
No. It's not a contest. The two of them. with themselves.

557
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:59,910
所以不要试图去演...
So don't play it for real...

558
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,829
要自然一点
until it gets real.

559
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,609
好的
Okay.

560
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,720
告诉我哪受伤了 宝贝
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

561
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,000
什么?
What?

562
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,040
我看应该演得亲热点 就像和其他女孩试镜一样
I wanna play this one nice and close like we did with that other girl...

563
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,690
黑头发那个叫什么名字? 感觉挺好的 你认为怎样
what's her name? With the black hair. It felt good, what do you think?

564
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:26,080
很好 伍迪 说那句台词别太快了
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush that line again. I told you...

565
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,849
你说的是那句台词吧? "免得什么?"
the line where you say: "Before what?"

566
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:35,739
演戏是相互影响的 我只是配合而已 她们都说的很快
Bobby, acting is reacting. I just play off them. They all say:

567
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,650
"他们会逮捕你" 或者"你会去坐牢" 都说的很快
"They're gonna arrest you", like that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

568
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:43,230
她们说的很快 我也自然说得快
They say it the same way. So when they say it, I just react.

569
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:44,760
-你叫什么名字? -贝蒂
-What's your name? -Betty.

570
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:50,020
听着 如果你能慢一点 我也会慢一点的 好吗?
Betty, look. You don't rush it, I don't rush it, okay?

571
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:55,749
我们亲热一点 就像是在电影里 好吗?
Now, we're gonna play this nice and close just like in the movies, okay?

572
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,349
父亲最好的朋友上班去了
Dad's best friend goes to work.

573
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:04,039
鲍勃?
Bob?

574
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,429
开始
action!

575
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,319
你还没走
You're still here.

576
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,800
我回来了
I came back.

577
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,280
-这不正如你所愿吗? -没人想看见你
-I thought that's what you wanted. -Nobody wants you here.

578
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,980
真的吗?
Really?

579
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,300
我父母就在楼上 他们以为你已经走了
My parents are right upstairs. They think you've left.

580
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,029
那又怎样?很惊讶吧
So, surprise!

581
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:36,489
-我要叫他们下来 我要叫我父亲下来 -你不会的
-I can call them, I can call my dad. -But you won't.

582
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,669
你会玩死自己的
You're playing a dangerous game here.

583
01:17:57,030 --> 01:18:00,160
你恐吓我是没有用的
If you're trying to blackmail me...

584
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,589
你知道我想怎么样的
it's not gonna work.

585
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:08,439
也不是很难满足的
You know what I want. It's not that difficult.

586
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,169
出去
Get out.

587
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,759
要不我把父亲叫下来
Get out before I call my dad.

588
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:25,149
他很信任你 把你当最好的朋友
He trusts you. You're his.best friend.

589
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,849
一切都将结束
This will be the end of everything.

590
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:37,939
你呢? 你父亲会怎么看你?
What about you? What'll your dad think about you?

591
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,989
别说了
Stop it.

592
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,269
你从一开始就这么说
That's what you said from the beginning.

593
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:53,009
如果我把实情告诉他们 他们会把你送进监狱
If I tell them what happened, they will arrest you and put you in jail.

594
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,510
请马上离开这
So get out of here...

595
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,309
免得我...
before...

596
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,979
免得你什么?
Before what?

597
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,029
免得...
Before...

598
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,399
我宰了你
I kill you.

599
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,759
那你就要去坐牢了
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

600
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,729
我恨你
I hate you.

601
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,889

604
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:35,509

Very good. Really.

607
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:48,659
略有点造作 不过还是挺动情的
I mean, it was forced maybe, but still humanistic.

608
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:53,469
是的 非常好
Very good. Really!

609
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:55,759

She's a slam-dunk! Where the hell did you find her?

625
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:59,049
天哪 真的太烂了
God, that was awful!

626
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:04,620
不是说你 你演技一流 但可怜的沃里
Not you, Betty. You were stellar, and I mean that. But poor Wally.

627
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:09,150
他永远演不好戏 他已经是20年前的人物了
He'll never get that picture made. Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

628
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:12,490
伍迪·卡特滋做这些只是兴趣
You know Woody Katz is only doing it for a favor.

629
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:14,710
至于演技 我听说非常烂
And the cast they have so far is terrible.

630
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:19,410
是的 很烂 沃里这个可怜的蠢老头
Oh, God, terrible! That poor old fool Wally.

631
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:23,240
他很好 他看起来很和蔼

And Wally...Mr. Brown is a very close friend of my aunt's.

633
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:29,400
别误会了 我爱沃里
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

634
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,810
本应如此 我和他结婚10年了
I ought to, I was married to him for 1O years.

635
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:38,539
我喜欢演员 所有的演员 我们只是有点油罢了
And I love actors. All actors. We just get a little catty sometimes.

636
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,290
我们给你介绍一位出类拔萃的导演
We want to take you across and introduce you to a director who's a head above the rest.

637
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,970

He's got a project you will kill for.

638
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,639
一炮而红

Are you kidding me? I loved the script. Just show me where to sign.

643
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:59,950
我喜欢你 不过我要见完...
I love you, but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing...

644
01:24:59,950 --> 01:25:02,520
所有人选后再决定 我会尽快通知你的
until I've seen everyone. I'll let you know as soon as I can.

645
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,839
我知道你会的 因为我的经纪人会日夜骚扰你 我也会
I know you will. Because my manager is gonna be bugging you. And me!

646

My pleasure. Now get outta here. You're so cruel to me.

647

01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,600
看到没?
You see?

673
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,619
都说过没什么可怕的了
I told you there was nothing to be afraid of.

674
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:38,839
贝蒂 等等
Betty, wait. Wait!

675
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:42,879
别
Don't.

676
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,040
没人在家
No one's home.

677
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,659
什么事?
Yes?

678
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,869
戴安妮
Diane?

679
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:20,729
她在17号
Number 17.

680
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,049
但那上面写着是12号
But it said number 12.

681
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:29,020
我和她换了房子 她在17号
I switched apartments with her.

682
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,869
在左边的最尽头
She's in 17. It's down at the end, on the left.

683
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:40,419
不过她好几天没露面了
But she hasn't been around for a few days.

684
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,060
我们可以给她留个条
We'll leave her a note.

685
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,039
我和你们一起去
I'll go with you.

686
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,529
我还有东西在她那里
She still got some of my stuff.

687
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,869
你们去吧 我要接个电话
You go ahead. I gotta get that.

688
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,519
-估计你不是戴安妮·西恩 -我也觉得不是
-Guess you're not Diane Selwyn. -Guess I'm not.

689
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,879
可能还是没人在家
There's still no one home, I guess.

690
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:30,889
你在干什么? 来吧 帮我一把
What are you doing? Come on, help me in.

691
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:34,679
我要把前门打开
Come on, I'll open the front door.

692
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,049
别
No!

693
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:43,349
帮帮我
Come on.

694
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,509
帮帮我
Come on!

695
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,839
我知道你在做什么
I know what you're doing.

696
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:41,289
我知道你要做什么
I know what you have to do.

697
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:46,259
还是让我来吧
But let me do it.

698
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:57,329
让我来吧
Let me do it.

699
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:22,899
看着已经不像你了
You look like someone else.

700
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:46,710
晚安 贝蒂
Good night, Betty.

701
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:49,840
在屋里你不需要戴的
You don't have to wear that in the house.

702
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,650
什么?
What?

703
01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:53,670
假发
The wig!

704
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,639
只是想多看会现在的样子 睡觉时我会脱下的
I was just looking at myself again. I'll take it off to sleep.

705
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,400
别睡在沙发上了
You don't have to sleep on that couch.

706
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,920
-没关系的 -不要 这张床大的很
-No, it's okay.- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

707
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,999
来吧 上来睡个好觉吧
Come on, just get in and get a good night sleep.

708
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:44,529
比睡沙发舒服多了 是吗?
It's more comfortable than the couch, isn't it?

709
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:55,899
谢谢你 贝蒂
Thank you, Betty.

710
01:39:56,610 --> 01:40:01,550
别客气 昨晚不该让你睡沙发的
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let you sleep on the couch last night.

711
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:03,349

716
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:21,109
你以前这么做过吗?
Have you ever done this before?

717
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:24,850
我不知道
I don't know.

718
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,439
你呢?
Have you?

719
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:43,489
我想和你在一起
I want to with you.

720
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:12,099

I'm in love with you.

721
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,069
我爱你
I'm in love with you.

722
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:58,019

Silence.

723
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:01,179
寂静
Silence.

724
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:05,159
寂静
Silence.

725
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,769
没有乐队
There's no band.

726
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:12,349
没有乐队
There's no band.

727
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:16,039
没有乐队
There's no orchestra.

728
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:33,369
寂静
Silence!

729
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:37,929
丽塔 没有乐队
Rita? There's no band.

730
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:40,849
丽塔 醒醒
Rita, wake up!

731
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,600
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

732
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,609
不 不对
No, it's not okay.

733
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:51,919
怎么?
What's wrong?

734
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:55,359
跟我到一个地方去
Go with me somewhere.

735
01:43:56,790 --> 01:44:00,229
现在是2点 凌晨2点
It's two o'clock. It's two o'clock in the morning.

736
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:07,130
跟我到一个地方去
Go with me somewhere.

737
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:09,350
可以
Sure.

738
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:10,849
现在吗?
Now?

739

马上就去
Right now.

740
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,779
没有乐队
There's no band!

741
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:55,749
没有乐队
There is no band!

742
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,709
这全是...
This is all...

743
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,950
这些全是录音
a tape recording.

744
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:08,899
没有乐队 然而...
There's no band, and yet...

745
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:12,239
我们可以听到乐声
we hear a band.

746
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,859
如果我们想听竖笛...
If we want to hear a clarinet...

747
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:18,289
听着...
listen...

748
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:35,169
请听长号声
A muted trombone.

749
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:53,049
减弱的喇叭声
A muted trumpet.

750
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:13,689
这全是录音
It's all recorded.

751
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:19,049
没有乐队
There's no band!

752
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:22,349
这全是...
It is all...

753
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:25,309

a tape.

754
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:42,359
这全是...幻觉
It is an illusion.

755
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,999
听着
Listen!

756
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:08,960
女士们 先生们 欢迎光临寂静酒吧

760
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:17,139

761
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,099
嘿 靓女
Hey, pretty girl.

762
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,029
该起床了
Time to wake up.

763
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:45,199
你去哪了? 你要干嘛?
Where have you been? What do you want?

764
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:48,819
来拿我的灯和盘子
My lamp and dishes.

765
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:53,549
戴安妮 已经三个星期了
Come on, Diane, it's been three weeks.

766
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,019
盘子放到那个箱子里了
I put your dishes in that box.

767
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:22,599
那是我的烟灰缸 拿走吧
That's my ashtray. Take it.

768
01:59:34,370 --> 01:59:38,709
我只是想确认一下 戴安妮
Anytime. I'm just making sure, Diane.

769
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:50,259
就这些了吗?
This is it?

770
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:59,419
顺便说一下 那两个探员又来找过你
By the way, those two detectives came by again looking for you.

771
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:55,499
卡米拉
Camilla!

772
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,369
你终于回来了
You've come back.

773
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:44,829
刚才你说什么? 美人
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

774
02:02:45,350 --> 02:02:47,580
我说...
I said...

775
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:50,319
你令我疯狂
you drive me wild.

776
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:05,319
我们不该再这样做
We shouldn't do this anymore.

777
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:14,049
不要这样说
Don't say that.

778
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:21,890
永远不要这样说
Don't ever say that.

779
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:24,010
不要 戴安妮
Don't, Diane!

780
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:25,680
住手
Stop it!

781
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:27,339
戴安妮 住手
Diane, stop!

782
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,199
我以前已经跟你说过
I've tried to tell you this before.

783
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:41,949
因为他 对吗?
It's him, isn't it?

784
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:57,499
我不是教怎么演这出戏 你只需要...
I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene, but just...

785
02:03:58,110 --> 02:04:01,129
看着我做 相信你会明白我的意思
watch me and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

786
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:09,170
不要坐得那么拘谨
Don't sit so rigid, just...

787
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:10,659
放松
just relax.

788
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:15,669
现在是二人世界 非常的惬意
Now, the two of you are alone and it's real comfortable.

789
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:20,170
就像你们以前认识
Like you've known each other forever.

790
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:23,469
即使什么也不说也很惬意
Even if you don't say anything, it's real comfortable.

791
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:28,870
汉克 可以清一下场吗? 这里太多人了
Hank, can you just clear the set? There's too many people around here.

792
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:31,960
让我们把这演完 请清场
Let's get this worked out. Clear the set!

793
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:34,559
大家都喝咖啡去
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

794
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:39,090
请! 戴安妮可以留下吗?
Everyone, please! Can Diane stay?

795
02:04:39,090 --> 02:04:40,179
当然可以 汉克 让戴安妮留下
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay. Hank, let Diane stay!

796
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:44,659
戴安妮
Diane!

797
02:04:50,050 --> 02:04:53,419
当她开始哭的时候 不要拉她过来
Now, when she starts to cry, don't pull her towards you.

798
02:04:55,550 --> 02:05:00,379
让她自己靠过来 让她靠过来
Let her fall into you. Just let her fall.

799
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:10,959
你吻她是个连贯的动作
And when you kiss her...it's just a continuation of that move.

800
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:15,439
中间是没有停顿的
There's no break.

801
02:05:40,370 --> 02:05:42,579
熄灯
Kill the lights!

802
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,950
别发癫了 不要这样
Don't be mad. Don't make it be like this.

803
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:59,820
你想让我视而不见吗?
Oh, sure, you want me to make this easy for you.

804
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:02,659
没门 不会的
No fucking way! It's not gonna be!

805
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,969
我可不是好糊弄的 戴安妮
It's not easy for me! Diane!

806
02:07:30,110 --> 02:07:33,369
喂 是我 请留言

Good. It means so much to me.

813
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:10,160
快点吧 车就在你门外等着
Go on. The car's right outside your house.

814
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:12,929
一直在等你 知道吗?
It's been waiting, okay?

815
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,240
好的

我一直想来这里

837
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:15,189
因为一场吉特巴舞比赛的胜利

让我有了演戏的欲望

我从没和卢姬去过卡萨布兰卡
I never went to Casablanca with Luigi.

847
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:51,749

848

849

是的
Yes.

853
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:23,699
他没怎么考虑过我
He didn't think so much of me.

854
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:30,729
总之我们就在那时成为朋友的

I see.

858
02:14:56,720 --> 02:15:00,889
因此我有物资 她有人才
So I got the pool, and she got the pool man.

859
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:07,189
简直不能相信 我想给法官买一辆劳斯莱斯
I couldn't believe it. I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

860
02:15:13,810 --> 02:15:16,579
有时奇迹会出现
Sometimes, good things happen.

861
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:13,019
最精彩的总是留到最后
So I guess we've saved the best for last.

862
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:19,879
-你来和大家说吧 -不 还是你来吧
-Do you want to tell them? -No, you tell them.

863
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:26,069

868
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:16,489
别在这给我看
Don't show me this fucking thing here.

869
02:17:17,190 --> 02:17:20,449
不过是张明星照 人人都可以有的
It's just an actress' photo resume. Everybody's got one.

870
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,700
带钱了吗?
You got the money?

871
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:26,779
当然
I sure do.

872
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,709
好的 把钱给我 我们就算成交了
Okay, now, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.

873
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:47,699
你真想这么做吗?
You sure you want this?

874
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:55,459
做梦都想
More than anything in this world.

875
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:09,099
事成后 你会在我告诉你的地方找到这个
When it's finished, you'll find this where I told you.

876
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:25,689
用来开什么的?
What's it open?

877
02:22:50,650 --> 02:22:52,869
寂静

878
02:22:52,869 --> 02:22:57,869
