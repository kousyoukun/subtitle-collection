1
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,126
MULHOLLAND DR.

2
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:59,529
What are you doing? We don't stop here!

3
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:13,902
Get out of the car.

4
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:54,340
The boys found this...

5
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,005
on the floor in back of the Caddy.

6
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:01,131
Yeah, they showed me.

7
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,840
Could be unrelated.

8
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,464
Could be.

9
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:11,422
Any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?

10
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:17,087
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

11
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,796
That's what I'm thinkin'.

12
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,084
Just one more bag after that.

13
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:48,324
I just wanted to come here.

14
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,199
To Winkie's?

15
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:54,490
This Winkie's.

16
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:59,198
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

17
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:04,988
It's kind of embarrassing...

18
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,489
Go ahead.

19
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,322
I had a dream about this place.

20
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:12,988
Oh boy.

21
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,697
You see what I mean?

22
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:21,945
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

23
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:25,154
Tell me.

24
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:30,695
Well...

25
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:32,985
it's the second one I've had...

26
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:36,653
but they are both the same...

27
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:38,985
they start out that I'm in here but...

28
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:43,235
it's not day or night.

29
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,527
It's kinda half night, you know?...

30
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:49,360
but it looks just like this...

31
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:52,694
except for the light.

32
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:57,067
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

33
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,067
Of all people,

34
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:04,024
you're standing right over there...

35
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:10,483
by that counter.

36
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,941
You're in both dreams and you're scared.

37
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:21,524
I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and...

38
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:27,481
then I realize what it is.

39
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,023
There's a man...

40
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:36,897
in back of this place.

41
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:41,272
He's the one who's doing it.

42
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:44,564
I can see him through the wall.

43
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:48,271
I can see his face...

44
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:55,186
I hope that I never see that face ever...

45
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:59,478
outside of the dream.

46
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:10,102
That's it.

47
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:11,894
So...

48
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:16,561
you came to see if it's out there?

49
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,102
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

50
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:27,559
Right thing.

51
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:16,430
It's around here.

52
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:29,173
Dan? You all right? Dan? Dan?

53
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,212
Hello?

54
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:03,711
The girl is still missing.

55
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:23,751
Talk to me.

56
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:27,418
The same.

57
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,539
Oh... I can't believe it!

58
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,577
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

59
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:41,577
It's been so nice travelling with you.

60
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,118
Thank you, Irene. I was so excited and nervous.

61
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,785
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

62
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,286
Remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.

63
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,951
Okay Irene. Won't that be the day.

64
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:56,160
Good luck, Betty dear.

65
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:58,952
Take care of yourself and be careful.

66
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,327
I will. Thanks again.

67
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:02,784
Thanks again.

68
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,825
Betty, it was so nice meeting you All the luck in the world.

69
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:09,365
Bye.

70
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,407
My bags!

71
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,283
Where to?

72
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,990
1612 Havenhurst.

73
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,406
Got it!

74
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,983
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

75
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,733
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

76
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,732
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

77
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,774
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

78
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,607
Pleased to meet you. - Just call me Coco.

79
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,272
Everybody else does. Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

80
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:04,606
OK, Coco.

81
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,355
Wilkins?! Wilkins?!?!

82
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:14,355
If that damned dog craps in the courtyard one more time...

83
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,855
I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast.

84
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:20,271
You don't have pets do you? - No, I don't.

85
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:23,772
They're allowed, I just don't like 'em here... for obvious reasons.

86
00:21:24,022 --> 00:21:26,395
You know, there was a man that lived here once...

87
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:29,145
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

88
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,520
Well, You just wouldn't believe...

89
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:35,561
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

90
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,686
Let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.

91
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:42,394
I can hardly wait!

92
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:50,268
It's unbelievable!

93
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,602
I told ya. - Wow!

94
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:57,809
Well, you and your Aunt probably have an understanding, so here's the key.

95
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,601
And if you need anything, just give a holler.

96
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,101
Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me...

97
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:06,766
or they wouldn't be here.

98
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,183
If you want, later on I'll introduce you around.

99
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:14,641
No hard feelings if you don't.

100
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,466
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell me someone was going to be here.

101
00:23:42,718 --> 00:23:45,883
- I'm so sorry. - It's OK

102
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,173
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.

103
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:51,924
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

104
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:53,923
There was an accident.

105
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:56,089
I came here.

106
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:58,756
I understand. I saw the dress.

107
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:02,589
Sorry. Are you all right?

108
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,798
What happened?

109
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,464
A car...

110
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:12,339
a car accident.

111
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:16,380
Oh... You OK?

112
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,421
I think so.

113
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:21,962
I was just...

114
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:23,962
taking a shower.

115
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,962
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

116
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:31,004
I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

117
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:37,586
What's your name?

118
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:45,544
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here and we can talk later.

119
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:24,248
My name's... Rita.

120
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,373
Hi...

121
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,956
do you work with my Aunt?

122
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,582
No... I... - Sorry...

123
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:37,956
it's none of my business.

124
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,913
She has pretty red hair...

125
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:44,246
She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...

126
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:46,246
that's being made in Canada...

127
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:49,913
but I guess you already know that.

128
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:52,413
I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years.

129
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:56,495
Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star.

130
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:59,787
Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star,

131
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:02,203
but sometimes people end up being both and so that is,

132
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:08,453
I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here.

133
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:14,118
I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here...

134
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,702
I mean I just came here from Deep River, Ontario...

135
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:19,535
now I'm in this...

136
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,493
dream place.

137
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:25,493
You can imagine how I feel.

138
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:35,034
Oh... What? Sit down...

139
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:41,491
Where were you hurt?

140
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,407
We should call a doctor. - No

141
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:47,199
But, this could be serious. - No, I...

142
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:49,032
I need to sleep.

143
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:51,324
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.

144
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:54,115
It will feel okay if I sleep.

145
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:59,282
I just need to lie down here and sleep.

146
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:58,943
You see Adam... there are some suggestions

147
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,150
that are to be brought forward ...

148
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:04,317
and I know you said you would entertain suggestions

149
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:08,608
and that's all anybody here is asking you to do.

150
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,816
What are you talking about?

151
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,441
An open mind...

152
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,733
You're in the process of re-casting your lead actress and

153
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,733
I'm...

154
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:24,650
We're asking you to keep an open mind.

155
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:37,188
What was it last time?

156
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,938
OK. Let's try the next one.

157
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,480
He's not gonna like it.

158
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:46,813
We'll see.

159
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,354
Ah... Castigliane brothers.

160
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:58,020
Let me introduce you around...

161
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:01,228
please ... take a seat.

162
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,520
this is Mr. Darby, whom you know

163
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:07,186
and this is the director Adam Kesher...

164
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:12,186
and his manager Robert Smith.

165
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:45,517
Oh,

166
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:49,182
She's very pretty.

167
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:54,225
May I offer you, gentlemen... anything?

168
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:57,390
Espresso. - Nothing.

169
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:02,598
- What's the photo for? - An espresso.

170
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,806
No, that's it.

171
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:07,097
I think you're gonna enjoy your espresso this time.

172
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,847
I've done quite a bit of a research knowing how hard you are to please.

173
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,513
This one comes highly recommended.

174
00:30:13,765 --> 00:30:16,639
What's the photo for?

175
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,888
It's a recommendation...

176
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,055
a recommendation to you, Adam,

177
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:27,053
- It's not a recommendation. - This is the girl.

178
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:30,928
What girl?. For what?. What is this, Ray?.

179
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,429
We'd be happy to put her on the list for consideration.

180
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,886
You'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

181
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:43,427
Interest?. No.

182
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,220
There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.

183
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,886
This is the girl.

184
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,052
- Ray, take care of this. - Hold on, Adam.

185
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:53,051
Hold on?.

186
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:57,218
There's no way. There's no way!

187
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,550
Napkin.

188
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:17,008
- Pardon? - Napkin.

189
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:19,715
Of course.

190
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:23,381
Excuse me.

191
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:42,005
Is that all sir?.

192
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:38,418
Shit.

193
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:41,083
Sorry! That was a highly recommended...

194
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,582
That's considered one of the finest espressos in the world, Sir.

195
00:32:43,834 --> 00:32:47,333
What's going on here? There's no way that girl is in my movie.

196
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,832
HELP ME!!!

197
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,539
This is the girl.

198
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:57,748
Hey! That girl is not in my film!

199
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,998
It's no longer your film.

200
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,956
This is the girl.

201
00:33:47,412 --> 00:33:50,826
Did the Castigliane brothers get out of that limo?

202
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:53,077
- They two guys in dark suits? - Yeah.

203
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:57,451
- Yes. - Keep that door open.

204
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:08,033
Castigliane brothers?

205
00:34:08,285 --> 00:34:11,699
Beat it, pal.

206
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:58,071
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

207
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:02,862
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

208
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:07,652
The director doesn't want her.

209
00:35:09,071 --> 00:35:13,527
Do you want him replaced?.

210
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,902
I know they said...

211
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,777
Then?

212
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:23,193
Then...

213
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:26,859
that means we should...

214
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:31,984
Yes?.

215
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:33,983
Shut everything down ...

216
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:37,566
Is that something that...

217
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:40,067
do you want us...

218
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:43,774
to shut everything down?

219
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:51,982
Then we'll shut everything down.

220
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:23,230
Oh man, that's unheard of ...

221
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:28,105
an accident like that ... who could have foreseen that?

222
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,770
- That's unreal, right?

223
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,519
Hell, right.

224
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:37,394
Unbelievable.

225
00:36:42,395 --> 00:36:44,727
So, bro, God you're good!

226
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,727
What have you been doin'?

227
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:50,186
Just doin' some stuff for this guy.

228
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,309
Yeah?. Making ends meet, huh?

229
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,143
Hardly.

230
00:36:57,144 --> 00:36:58,684
I know, man.

231
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:01,808
Look at my digs.

232
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,142
Times are tough, bro.

233
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:09,517
Hey, man, it's not that bad.

234
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:11,516
I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.

235
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:13,558
It was just a thing.

236
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,557
The story made you laugh.

237
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:20,766
- It was a funny story. - Fucking car accident.

238
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:25,849
It's it?...

239
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,931
It's the famous black book.

240
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:36,889
The history of the world in phone numbers.

241
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:09,427
Oh, man!.

242
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:24,010
Something bit me BAD!

243
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,882
God!

244
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:14,172
Hey man!

245
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:18,880
She's hurt bad! Could you come here and call on the phone. Please I need you!

246
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:23,670
She's hurt bad! You gotta call the hospital

247
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,670
Come on man! I'm serious about this!

248
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:30,004
I can't do everything by myself!

249
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,126
Hey man!.

250
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,623
OH!

251
00:40:49,873 --> 00:40:52,663
...okay Aunt Ruth... I'll try.

252
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:57,912
I'm gonna study those lines until I know them inside out.

253
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:01,120
Yep, either here on this fabulous leather couch...

254
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,120
or I'll take them with a coffee in the courtyard...

255
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:05,996
like a regular movie star.

256
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,536
Oh! I got a real shock to find your friend Rita here.

257
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:13,369
She was in the shower and I opened the door ...

258
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:17,202
... what do you mean?

259
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:20,493
... She was in an accident.

260
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:24,910
... Rita, your friend.

261
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:28,909
No, Coco unlocked the door.

262
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,910
... No, she didn't see her.

263
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,033
... She's sleeping.

264
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:36,992
I'm sure there's some explanation for this Aunt Ruth,

265
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:40,992
I don't think we have to do that.

266
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:47,282
Please don't worry... we don't need the police.

267
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:02,198
You're awake...

268
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,989
I think I misunderstood.

269
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,655
I thought you knew my Aunt and that's why you were here.

270
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:16,029
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police.

271
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,529
I'm... sorry. I ...

272
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:32,237
What is it Rita?

273
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:36,820
I thought when I woke up...

274
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,652
I thought sleep would do it...

275
00:42:39,904 --> 00:42:42,777
What's wrong?

276
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,277
I don't know who I am.

277
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,486
What do you mean? You're Rita.

278
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:52,819
I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

279
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:57,484
I don't know who I am!!

280
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:11,691
This is your purse. Your name must be in your purse.

281
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:15,274
You want to know, don't you?

282
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:19,232
I ... yes, but ... I ... - Open it!

283
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:56,349
You sure you don't want anything? - Not here...no thanks.

284
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,223
Not a coke or something?

285
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:00,972
No... thanks though...

286
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:05,431
I'll take a cigarette if you have one.

287
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:10,930
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

288
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,055
Any new girls on the street lately?

289
00:45:21,056 --> 00:45:24,471
No.  I haven't seen any.

290
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,471
A brunette?

291
00:45:26,722 --> 00:45:30,136
... maybe a little beat up?

292
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:37,595
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?

293
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:42,595
- Sure. - You bet you will.

294
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:47,552
That money.

295
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:53,177
You don't know where it came from?

296
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,551
When you think of them... the money... the key...

297
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:04,425
does it make you remember anything?

298
00:46:04,843 --> 00:46:08,883
something ...

299
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:13,092
...something there is.

300
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:25,465
What did you say?

301
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,632
They fired everyone.

302
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:29,922
Who fired everyone?

303
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:34,297
Ray did! Please I'm talking on the phone,

304
00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:37,464
and then they closed the set... everybody's gone.

305
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:41,130
You'd better get down here Adam!

306
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,047
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.

307
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:46,755
I'm going home.

308
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,297
Home?!

309
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:50,296
Meet me at the office. We've got to do something...

310
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:52,296
... you've got to do something Adam!

311
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:54,462
I'm going home, Cynthia.

312
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,546
Adam, this isn't like you.

313
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:58,212
Please come to the office.

314
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:02,587
- There must be something we can do. - I'm going home.

315
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:15,961
I wonder where you were going.

316
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:23,001
Mulholland drive.

317
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,875
Mulholland drive?

318
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:32,626
That's where I was going...

319
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:36,875
Mulholland Drive.

320
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:40,792
Maybe that's where the accident was.

321
00:47:41,043 --> 00:47:44,542
There must be a police report. We could call...

322
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:46,541
We could call anonymously from a pay phone...

323
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:49,707
just to see if there was an accident.

324
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:52,373
Come on. It'll be just like in the movies.

325
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:56,582
We'll pretend to be someone else.

326
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,665
I want to walk around anyway.

327
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:02,123
I'm in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any of it.

328
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:06,831
Come on Rita. Do you feel up to it?

329
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:18,372
Okay... but just

330
00:48:18,872 --> 00:48:21,162
...just to see.

331
00:48:21,414 --> 00:48:25,412
Just to see if there was an accident...

332
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:29,620
on Mulholland Drive.

333
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,450
Lorraine?

334
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,157
Lorraine... you home?

335
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:19,907
Lorraine...

336
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,405
Now, you've done it!

337
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:50,029
Just forget you ever saw. It's better that way.

338
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:55,820
What the hell are you even doing here?

339
00:50:06,154 --> 00:50:10,319
What are you doing?

340
00:50:11,737 --> 00:50:14,694
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!!!

341
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,734
That bastard You bastard!

342
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:37,650
He's probably upset Lorraine.

343
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:46,150
WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???

344
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:49,275
STOP IT!!! STOP IT!!!

345
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:51,565
Adam, STOP IT!!!

346
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:54,940
STOP IT!!! STOP IT!!!

347
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:59,606
Adam, STOP IT!!!

348
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:05,439
What're you doin' You're hurting me!

349
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:12,772
That's not a way to treat your wife, buddy. I don't care what she's done.

350
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,938
Throw him out!

351
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:23,271
Throw him out!

352
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,062
Get out!

353
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:13,308
Let's hide it.

354
00:52:57,013 --> 00:53:00,469
There's one.

355
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:16,552
Hollywood Police Department

356
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:20,302
I'm inquiring about an accident that happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

357
00:53:20,553 --> 00:53:24,426
Hold please. I'll connect you to traffic.

358
00:53:25,011 --> 00:53:29,926
- Sergeant Baxter, - Hi. I'm inquiring...

359
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:33,634
well, I heard a sound last night that sounded sort of like a carcrash and

360
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:37,758
I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.

361
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,758
Yes, there was.

362
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,883
- Can you tell me what happened? - No. I can't.

363
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:47,424
- Was anyone hurt? - May I have your name please?

364
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:54,924
There was an accident.

365
00:53:55,175 --> 00:53:56,965
He wouldn't tell me anything else, but that was your accident Rita.

366
00:53:57,217 --> 00:54:00,673
I just know it was.

367
00:54:00,674 --> 00:54:03,089
Maybe there's something about it in the papers.

368
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,089
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee and we can see.

369
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:13,255
Maybe it happened so late it's not going to be in today's paper.

370
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:16,964
There's nothing?

371
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,589
Not that I can see.

372
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:23,921
That's Ok.

373
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:27,796
Thanks...

374
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:32,795
... Diane.

375
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:39,420
That'd be all? You want your check?

376
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:43,003
Rita, you want something?

377
00:54:44,421 --> 00:54:50,252
- No. Just the coffee. - I'll take our check.

378
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:59,542
What is it Rita? -Shhhh.

379
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:09,542
I remember something...

380
00:55:13,793 --> 00:55:17,083
- What is it? - Diane Selwyn.

381
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:21,290
Maybe that's my name.

382
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:28,998
D.Selwyn ... it's the only one.

383
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:32,706
I'm gonna call.

384
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:40,581
It's strange to be calling yourself.

385
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:44,288
Maybe it's not me.

386
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,329
Hello... this is me.

387
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,954
Leave me a message.

388
00:55:57,747 --> 00:56:00,996
It's not my voice...

389
00:56:01,246 --> 00:56:04,703
but I know her.

390
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:08,453
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

391
00:56:08,705 --> 00:56:10,745
Maybe that's your roommate...

392
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,203
or if it is Diane Selwyn...

393
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,493
she can tell you who you are.

394
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:22,410
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

395
00:57:01,658 --> 00:57:04,239
- Yeah, right ... get lost! - Is this Adam Kesher's house?

396
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:06,032
Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!

397
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:09,364
Get out!

398
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:21,696
Get out of here! He's never coming back! Ever!

399
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,196
I guess you don't understand English. She said to leave.

400
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:28,195
Here's the door.

401
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:32,570
OUT!

402
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:03,651
- Yeah...what is it, Cookie? - I'm sorry Mr. Kesher...

403
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,734
but there seems tobe some problem with your credit cards.

404
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:12,233
What??... I pay you cash, Cookie.

405
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:17,358
Fact is two guys from your bank came by.

406
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:20,023
My bank?

407
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:24,482
- How'd they know I was here? - I don't know.

408
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:25,774
What did they say?

409
00:58:26,025 --> 00:58:30,315
I'm afraid they said you're maxed out at your bank...

410
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:35,357
and your line of credit has been cancelled.

411
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:38,939
It's unbelievable.

412
00:58:39,232 --> 00:58:42,314
Look...

413
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,230
I don't know what's going on.

414
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,938
That's so much baloney.

415
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,979
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

416
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:55,313
I known... I known...

417
00:58:55,564 --> 00:58:57,354
Don't worry...

418
00:58:57,606 --> 00:59:00,229
I'm sorry.

419
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:03,896
It was my duty to inform you.

420
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:12,060
People you're hiding from, they know where you are.

421
00:59:12,354 --> 00:59:15,311
Right.

422
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,477
I'm sorry

423
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,767
Hello?

424
00:59:42,017 --> 00:59:43,808
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

425
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,808
I know. Where are you Adam?

426
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,099
What do you mean you know?

427
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,099
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you...

428
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,516
they told me you were as good as broke.

429
00:59:52,768 --> 00:59:54,808
I didn't believe them, so I made a few calls.

430
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,223
- And? - You're broke!

431
00:59:57,475 --> 00:59:58,849
But I'm not broke!

432
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,348
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?

433
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,889
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

434
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,555
Do you know somebody called the "The Cowboy"?

435
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:12,930
- "The Cowboy"? - Yes

436
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:14,639
Yeah, the Cowboy.

437
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:17,763
This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you.

438
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:21,887
Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

439
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:25,221
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to go to see the Cowboy.

440
01:00:25,473 --> 01:00:28,596
Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?

441
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:33,345
Listen. Something tells me this guy is connected to what's happening,

442
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:37,261
and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.

443
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,261
What's going on, Cynthia?

444
01:00:39,513 --> 01:00:43,428
It's been a very strange day...

445
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:47,218
and getting stranger.

446
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:52,010
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean... do I have to ride out to the range?

447
01:00:52,262 --> 01:00:54,302
Sort of, funny boy.

448
01:00:54,554 --> 01:00:56,386
If I tell him the meeting's on...

449
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:59,259
you have to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon.

450
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:03,342
There's a corral up there where he'll be.

451
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:06,050
You've got to be kidding me!

452
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:08,467
Will you meet with him?

453
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,759
Yeah, sure.

454
01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:14,132
It's been that kind of a day. When?

455
01:01:14,385 --> 01:01:16,300
I'll call him, right away...

456
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:19,049
then I'll call you back.

457
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:24,216
You could stay at my place, if you want it.

458
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:26,423
Cynthia... I don't think it'll be a good idea.

459
01:01:26,675 --> 01:01:28,757
I'm just offering a place to stay.

460
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:32,047
And I appreciate the offer, Cynthia. I'll find a place.

461
01:01:32,299 --> 01:01:35,506
Now go on and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.

462
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,256
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

463
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:44,297
Just get along little dowgie and call me back.

464
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:56,920
It's right about here on Sierra Bonita.

465
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,004
That's not too far away.

466
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:03,045
What's wrong with that?

467
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:06,753
I'm not sure about this.

468
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:10,419
I know you're afraid of something.

469
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:14,336
We'll be careful. Promise.

470
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,835
Tomorrow we'll go over there...

471
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:21,628
and we'll find out.

472
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:36,459
It'll be okay.

473
01:02:37,835 --> 01:02:41,292
It's probabily Coco

474
01:02:43,252 --> 01:02:44,501
Yes?

475
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:45,916
May I help you?

476
01:02:46,168 --> 01:02:49,791
Someone is in trouble.

477
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:52,790
Who are you?

478
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,707
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

479
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,873
She's letting me stay here.

480
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:00,540
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

481
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,332
No it's not.

482
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,997
That's not what she said.

483
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:09,747
Someone is in trouble. Something bad is happening!

484
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:13,331
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are and...

485
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:18,038
Louise... What are you doing Louise?

486
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,204
Oh, Coco! I've been trying to find you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock.

487
01:03:22,456 --> 01:03:25,621
That one is in my room and she won't leave.

488
01:03:25,872 --> 01:03:29,538
I want you to get her out. I want you to get her out now.

489
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:32,370
This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she meant well.

490
01:03:32,622 --> 01:03:36,537
Louise, this is Betty, this is Ruth's niece.

491
01:03:36,788 --> 01:03:39,662
In fact and fortunately I was just on my way here to see Betty.

492
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:42,454
Betty's a young actress and I was just delivering...

493
01:03:42,704 --> 01:03:45,869
some faxed pages of a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

494
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,701
- Well, here they are honey. - Oh, thank you.

495
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:51,368
Now come along Louise and I'll take you home.

496
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,326
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes. Come on.

497
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:56,909
No, she said it was someone else who was in trouble.

498
01:03:57,161 --> 01:04:00,076
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home...

499
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:02,160
Come on.

500
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:04,992
- Goodnight Betty. - Goodnight.

501
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:08,326
Goodnight.

502
01:04:46,281 --> 01:04:49,238
Cowboy!

503
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:00,315
- Howdy! - Howdy to you.

504
01:06:01,067 --> 01:06:04,190
Beautiful evening.

505
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,522
Sure want to thank ya for coming all theway up to see me...

506
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:14,439
from that nice hotel Downtown.

507
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,397
No problem. What's on your mind?.

508
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:21,980
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right down to it.

509
01:06:22,231 --> 01:06:24,854
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

510
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,021
Whatever.

511
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:30,937
A man's attitude...

512
01:06:31,189 --> 01:06:33,812
... a man's attitude goes some ways

513
01:06:34,063 --> 01:06:36,686
the way his life will be.

514
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:40,019
Is that somethin' you might agree with?

515
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:41,894
Sure.

516
01:06:42,146 --> 01:06:45,811
Now... did you answer because you thought that's what I wanted to hear...

517
01:06:46,062 --> 01:06:48,102
or did you think about what I said...

518
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:53,311
and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?

519
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:59,101
I agree with what you said... truly.

520
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:02,809
What did I say?

521
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:09,350
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.

522
01:07:09,476 --> 01:07:11,891
So since you agree...

523
01:07:12,143 --> 01:07:16,974
you must be a person who does not care about the good life.

524
01:07:17,226 --> 01:07:20,932
How's that?

525
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:24,848
Well, stop for a little second and think about it.

526
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:28,849
Can you do that for me?

527
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:34,265
Okay, I'm thinking.

528
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:38,056
No. You're not thinkin'

529
01:07:38,307 --> 01:07:42,430
You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

530
01:07:42,682 --> 01:07:46,805
Now I want ya to think and stop bein' a smart aleck.

531
01:07:47,057 --> 01:07:49,222
Can you try that for me?

532
01:07:49,473 --> 01:07:54,013
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?

533
01:07:54,265 --> 01:07:56,679
There's sometimes a buggy.

534
01:07:56,931 --> 01:08:00,054
How many drivers does a buggy have?

535
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:02,053
One.

536
01:08:02,305 --> 01:08:05,345
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy...

537
01:08:05,596 --> 01:08:10,345
and you if fix your attitude you can ride along with me.

538
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:11,886
Okay.

539
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:15,928
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

540
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:18,468
You were re-casting the lead actress anyway...

541
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,635
audition many girls for the part.

542
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:27,677
When you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today, you will say:

543
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:31,050
This is the girl.

544
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:33,633
The rest of the cast can stay.

545
01:08:33,885 --> 01:08:36,342
That is up to you.

546
01:08:36,593 --> 01:08:40,967
But that lead girl is not up to you.

547
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:44,175
Now, you will see me one more time...

548
01:08:44,426 --> 01:08:46,841
if you do good.

549
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:49,966
You will see me two more times...

550
01:08:50,218 --> 01:08:52,382
if you do bad.

551
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:55,757
Good night.

552
01:09:19,257 --> 01:09:21,005
You're still here?

553
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,880
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

554
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:26,712
Nobody wants you here!

555
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:28,629
Really?

556
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,336
My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left.

557
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:35,586
- So... surprise... - I can call them... I can call my dad...

558
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,836
But you won't...

559
01:09:38,088 --> 01:09:41,211
If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work.

560
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:43,295
You're playing a dangerous game here.

561
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,711
You know what I want... it's not that difficult.

562
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:49,336
Get out! Get out before I call my dad ...

563
01:09:49,587 --> 01:09:52,544
he trusts you... you're his best friend.

564
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:55,084
This will be the end of everything.

565
01:09:55,335 --> 01:09:58,375
What about you? What will your dad think about you?

566
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:02,959
Stop! Just stop! That's what you said from the beginning.

567
01:10:03,086 --> 01:10:06,126
If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

568
01:10:06,376 --> 01:10:08,209
so get out of here before...

569
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,792
Before what?

570
01:10:12,043 --> 01:10:15,083
Before I kill you.

571
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:19,166
Then they'd put you in jail.

572
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:24,623
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion:

573
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:29,124
I hate you... I hate us both!

574
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:32,289
Such a lame scene.

575
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:35,623
But you are really good.

576
01:10:35,874 --> 01:10:38,956
Thank you dahling!

577
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:53,829
Hi there!

578
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:57,204
Who are you?

579
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:11,494
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

580
01:11:24,578 --> 01:11:29,451
- What is it Coco? - Your aunt called

581
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,909
I was afraid of that.

582
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:35,076
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.

583
01:11:35,702 --> 01:11:38,450
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place.

584
01:11:38,702 --> 01:11:40,951
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad...

585
01:11:41,201 --> 01:11:44,034
and her plane was leaving, and she got it all mixed up.

586
01:11:44,285 --> 01:11:46,283
I kept telling her it was my friend Rita...

587
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:50,075
and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas...

588
01:11:50,325 --> 01:11:52,198
Look at me straight, sweetie.

589
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,365
Coco... she's very nice.

590
01:11:54,617 --> 01:11:56,198
Honey... you're a good kid.

591
01:11:56,450 --> 01:11:59,615
What you're telling me is a load of horse-pucky

592
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:02,490
even though it comes from a good place.

593
01:12:02,741 --> 01:12:05,864
Now, I'm gonna trust you to sort this thing out

594
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:09,573
- Thank you. - Don't make me out to be a sucker.

595
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:11,948
Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there.

596
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:13,948
Remember last night?

597
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:17,571
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

598
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:23,071
but if there is trouble get rid of it.

599
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:33,737
Is everything all right?

600
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,695
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

601
01:12:35,947 --> 01:12:39,070
No, no, everything is A-okay.

602
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,319
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

603
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:46,027
And my audition is in one hour.

604
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:07,192
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

605
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:10,359
- Don't drink all the coke. - Good luck!

606
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:13,691
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.

607
01:13:13,943 --> 01:13:17,357
- Okay. - Okay?

608
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,563
Come in.

609
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:49,647
Betty Elms, I'd like you to meet...

610
01:13:49,898 --> 01:13:52,813
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

611
01:13:53,064 --> 01:13:54,688
Woody Katz who we've cast in the part...

612
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:58,938
of "Chuck". He'll do the scene with you.

613
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:00,855
Bob Brooker, the director

614
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:03,646
and Julie Chadwick...

615
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,186
Now, our surprise guest is:

616
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:08,477
Linney James.

617
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,811
Alas we can't afford her to cast our show,

618
01:14:11,062 --> 01:14:13,686
but as casting agents go...

619
01:14:13,938 --> 01:14:16,394
she's the best.

620
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:19,518
Why thank you, Wally. Hello Betty.

621
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,476
Very pleased to meet you.

622
01:14:21,729 --> 01:14:25,435
This is my assistant, Nicki.

623
01:14:25,603 --> 01:14:27,768
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

624
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,893
Martha Johnson, who you met out front.

625
01:14:32,186 --> 01:14:34,351
Hi.

626
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:38,809
So shall we get it to go?

627
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:42,558
Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?

628
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,558
No, no, I'm fine.

629
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:49,808
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

630
01:14:52,225 --> 01:14:57,473
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there and we'll play the scene.

631
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,349
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say...

632
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,473
something to Betty before we begin?

633
01:15:03,724 --> 01:15:07,597
No... it's not a contest,

634
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:13,305
the two of them with themselves,

635
01:15:13,682 --> 01:15:17,222
so don't play it for real...

636
01:15:17,473 --> 01:15:21,930
until it gets real.

637
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,472
Okay.

638
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:30,096
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

639
01:15:30,346 --> 01:15:31,261
What?

640
01:15:31,513 --> 01:15:33,511
Hey Bobby, I want to play this one nice and close,

641
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,469
like we did with that other girl,

642
01:15:35,721 --> 01:15:38,261
what's her name? The one with the black hair. That felt kinda good.

643
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:40,011
- Whaddya think? - That's good, Woody.

644
01:15:40,262 --> 01:15:42,552
Just don't rush that line again.

645
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:47,260
I told you... the line where you say, "Before what?"

646
01:15:47,512 --> 01:15:50,052
Bobby, acting is reacting...

647
01:15:50,303 --> 01:15:53,677
I just play off 'em. They all say:

648
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,635
They're gonna arrest you like that...

649
01:15:55,887 --> 01:15:57,760
put you in jail... They all say it the same way,

650
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,218
so I react like that.

651
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:02,467
What's your name? - Betty

652
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,217
Yeah... Betty, look... You don't rush it. I don't rush it.

653
01:16:07,468 --> 01:16:10,216
We're gonna play it nice and close...

654
01:16:10,468 --> 01:16:14,883
just like in the movies. OK?

655
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:19,383
Dad's best friend goes to work.

656
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:28,340
And ... ACTION!!!!

657
01:16:31,924 --> 01:16:35,381
You're still here?

658
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:38,797
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.

659
01:16:39,048 --> 01:16:42,088
- Nobody wants you here. - Really?

660
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:46,505
My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left.

661
01:16:46,757 --> 01:16:48,839
So ... surprise!

662
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:52,297
I can call them... I can call my dad...

663
01:16:52,548 --> 01:16:55,630
But you won't...

664
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:14,211
You're playing a dangerous game here...

665
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,253
if you're trying to blackmail me...

666
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:21,002
it's not gonna work.

667
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,669
You know what I want..

668
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:27,376
it's not that difficult.

669
01:17:28,919 --> 01:17:32,001
Get out...

670
01:17:32,586 --> 01:17:35,793
Get out before I call my dad.

671
01:17:36,043 --> 01:17:38,125
He trusts you...

672
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:40,334
You're...

673
01:17:40,585 --> 01:17:43,708
his best friend.

674
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,417
This will be the end of everything.

675
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:55,499
What about you? What will your dad think about you?

676
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,206
Stop...

677
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:01,540
stop it!

678
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:05,373
That's what you said from the beginning.

679
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:08,498
If I tell them what happened... they'll arrest you...

680
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:12,163
and put you in jail,

681
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:19,789
so get out of here...

682
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:22,954
before...

683
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:28,203
Before what?

684
01:18:45,371 --> 01:18:47,745
Before...

685
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:51,494
I kill you.

686
01:19:05,244 --> 01:19:08,743
Then they'd put you in jail.

687
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:19,616
I hate you...

688
01:19:20,075 --> 01:19:23,490
I hate us both!

689
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:42,239
- I'm going to take her over there. - Yeah big time!

690
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,614
Wow! Well, there it was.

691
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:50,071
There it was all right!

692
01:19:50,323 --> 01:19:54,655
Baby, you got away with it!

693
01:19:56,822 --> 01:19:59,529
Very good. Really.

694
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,237
I mean it was forced maybe...

695
01:20:02,489 --> 01:20:06,320
but still humanistic.

696
01:20:06,572 --> 01:20:07,320
Yeah,

697
01:20:07,572 --> 01:20:09,320
very good,

698
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:13,654
really.

699
01:20:18,404 --> 01:20:20,860
Oh I thank you Betty...

700
01:20:21,111 --> 01:20:23,568
and I really mean that sincerely.

701
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,817
I mean, it was extraordinary.

702
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:29,568
You've done your Aunt proud...

703
01:20:29,819 --> 01:20:33,776
and I'm going to tell her the first chance I get.

704
01:20:34,027 --> 01:20:36,276
Now, you and I...

705
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:38,276
are gonna speak again soon.

706
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,652
Thank you Mr. Brown.

707
01:20:40,901 --> 01:20:42,650
Thank you, Wally.

708
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,024
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk about. We'll walk Betty out.

709
01:20:46,276 --> 01:20:50,024
Well, yes indeed. And it was our pleasure, Linney.

710
01:20:50,276 --> 01:20:52,649
Don't you be a stranger around here.

711
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,815
- We'd love to have you here. - Come on, Betty.

712
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:57,648
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

713
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,274
It was nice meeting all of you.

714
01:21:08,649 --> 01:21:11,398
Wow!

715
01:21:11,648 --> 01:21:13,397
How do you find her...

716
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:17,105
God, that was awful!

717
01:21:17,357 --> 01:21:19,771
Not you Betty. You were stellar and I mean that

718
01:21:20,023 --> 01:21:21,646
But poor Wally.

719
01:21:21,897 --> 01:21:23,812
He'll never get that picture made. - Why?

720
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:26,188
Wally's days were up twenty years ago.

721
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:29,396
You know Woody Katz is only doing it for a favor?

722
01:21:29,647 --> 01:21:31,604
And the cast is terrible...

723
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:33,728
Oh, God, terrible

724
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:36,104
Poor old fool Wally...

725
01:21:36,355 --> 01:21:40,103
It was very nice and he seems so sweet.

726
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:43,144
and Wally... Mr. Brown... is a very close friendof my Aunt's, so...

727
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:46,144
Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong. I love Wally.

728
01:21:46,396 --> 01:21:49,852
I ought to. I was married to him for ten years.

729
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:52,935
And I love actors, all actors.

730
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:56,269
We just get a little catty sometimes.

731
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,018
Now we want to take you across and introduce you to a director...

732
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:00,935
who's a head above the rest

733
01:22:01,186 --> 01:22:03,976
He's got a project that you would kill!

734
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:07,726
Knock it right out of the park.

735
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,599
~ Sixteen reasons ~

736
01:22:10,851 --> 01:22:13,350

Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol. I'm coming back.

768
01:24:02,757 --> 01:24:04,964
Check it again? Check it again!

769
01:24:05,216 --> 01:24:06,964
Thank you! Will tell you what happens next!

770
01:24:07,216 --> 01:24:10,256
Thank you very much, for coming in I know how busy you are.

771
01:24:10,507 --> 01:24:13,381
Oh, are you kidding me? I love this script! Show me where to sign!

772
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,381
Look... I love you...

773
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:18,130
but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

774
01:24:18,382 --> 01:24:20,130
- I'll let you know as soon as I can. - I know you will.

775
01:24:20,382 --> 01:24:24,255
cause my manager's gonna be bugging you day and night. ... and me.

776
01:24:24,506 --> 01:24:26,588
- It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here. - Oh, you're just so cruel to me...

777
01:24:26,838 --> 01:24:28,962
don't forget me. I'm the girl that's going to play this part.

778
01:24:29,214 --> 01:24:32,462
See ya later.

779
01:24:32,713 --> 01:24:34,753
Hank... where's Hank?

780
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:38,711
- Who's next, Hank? - Camilla Rhodes.

781
01:24:38,796 --> 01:24:41,878

784
01:24:55,794 --> 01:24:58,417
Ok, here we go... Let's lock it up, please!

785
01:24:58,669 --> 01:25:00,918
- Roll sound please... - That's it!

786
01:25:01,169 --> 01:25:04,625
Playback! ACTION!

787
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:19,125
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

788
01:25:19,376 --> 01:25:22,791
~ Oh, baby I've told ~

789
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:24,832
~ every little star ~

790
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:29,332
~ just how sweet I think you are ~

791
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:34,540
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

792
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,664
Get Jason over here.

793
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:40,956
Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason. ~ I've told ripples in a brook ~

794
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:45,539
~ Made my heart an open book ~

795
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:52,705
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

796
01:25:53,289 --> 01:25:56,870
~ Friends ask me "am I in love" ~

797
01:25:57,122 --> 01:26:01,120
~ I always answer "yes" ~

798
01:26:01,371 --> 01:26:05,120
~ Might as well confess ~

799
01:26:05,371 --> 01:26:08,745
~ If the answer's yes ~

800
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:13,119
~ Maybe you may love me too ~

801
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:18,911
~ Oh my darling if you do ~

802
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:22,785
~ Why haven't you told me? ~ Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

803
01:26:32,203 --> 01:26:35,701
This is the girl!

804
01:26:39,286 --> 01:26:43,867
Excellent choice, Adam.

805
01:26:53,034 --> 01:26:56,157
Oh... my goodness.

806
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:06,615
I have to be somewhere.

807
01:27:06,866 --> 01:27:09,948
I promised a friend.

808
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,865
I'm sorry. I must go...

809
01:27:38,072 --> 01:27:40,612
It should be around here...

810
01:27:40,863 --> 01:27:43,195
2590... That's it.

811
01:27:43,446 --> 01:27:44,945
Up there!

812
01:27:45,196 --> 01:27:49,153
- Does it look familiar? - No.

813
01:27:55,486 --> 01:27:57,776
- Don't stop! -What is it? What do you see?!

814
01:27:58,028 --> 01:28:02,359
- Those men in front, in the car. - Do you know them?!

815
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:03,776
No... but... -Keep going.

816
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:07,442
Go around to the back.

817
01:28:55,106 --> 01:28:58,562
Selwyn... number 12.

818
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:24,226
Now, you've got me scared.

819
01:29:47,768 --> 01:29:52,558
See, I told you there was nothing to be afraid of!

820
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:56,843
Betty wait... wait

821
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:00,885
Oh no... don't.

822
01:31:25,342 --> 01:31:26,924
No one's home.

823
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:30,465
Yes?

824
01:31:35,174 --> 01:31:39,005
Number 17.

825
01:31:39,048 --> 01:31:42,213
But it said number 12.

826
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:47,213
I switched apartments with her. She's in 17.

827
01:31:47,465 --> 01:31:50,797
It's down in the end on the left.

828
01:31:54,339 --> 01:31:58,087
She hasn't been around for a few days...

829
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:03,545
- Oh... we'll leave her a note. - I'll go with you.

830
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:09,002
She's still got some of my stuff.

831
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:17,002
You go ahead. I've got to get that.

832
01:32:31,294 --> 01:32:33,418
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

833
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:37,125
Guess I'm not.

834
01:33:12,582 --> 01:33:16,080
Still no one's home I guess.

835
01:33:44,288 --> 01:33:45,745
C'mon do it.

836
01:33:45,996 --> 01:33:48,703
C'mon help me in. Come on.

837
01:33:48,954 --> 01:33:52,369
I'll open the front door.

838
01:33:57,952 --> 01:34:01,034
C'mon.

839
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:34,646
I know what you're doing.

840
01:36:54,395 --> 01:36:57,809
I know what you have to do,

841
01:36:59,436 --> 01:37:02,892
but let me do it.

842
01:37:10,435 --> 01:37:13,891
Let me do it.

843
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:39,432
You look like someone else.

844
01:38:00,097 --> 01:38:02,346
Good night, Betty.

845
01:38:02,598 --> 01:38:04,388
You don't wear it in the house.

846
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:06,512
What?

847
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:09,511
The wig.

848
01:38:09,762 --> 01:38:12,885
Just I'm looking at myself again...

849
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:14,843
I'll take it off to sleep.

850
01:38:15,096 --> 01:38:17,303
And you don't have to sleep on that couch.

851
01:38:17,554 --> 01:38:19,552
No, it's okay.

852
01:38:19,803 --> 01:38:22,718
No it's not. This is a huge bed.

853
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:26,511
C'mon, just get in and get a good night sleep.

854
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:00,966
It's more confortable than the couch, isn't it?

855
01:39:01,217 --> 01:39:04,049
Yes.

856
01:39:09,924 --> 01:39:12,714
Thank you, Betty.

857
01:39:12,757 --> 01:39:14,755
It's nothing.

858
01:39:15,007 --> 01:39:17,131
I shouldn't have let you sleep on the couch last night.

859
01:39:17,382 --> 01:39:19,922
No... I mean...

860
01:39:20,173 --> 01:39:24,546
Thank you for everything.

861
01:39:26,382 --> 01:39:29,796
You're welcome.

862
01:39:38,463 --> 01:39:41,919
Good night, sweet Betty.

863
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:53,585
Good night.

864
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:38,040
Have you ever done this before?

865
01:40:38,582 --> 01:40:40,497
I don't known!

866
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:43,872
Have you?

867
01:40:56,206 --> 01:40:59,996
I want to with you...

868
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:28,534
I'm in love with you.

869
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:45,616
I'm in love with you.

870
01:42:11,283 --> 01:42:14,115
Silencio.

871
01:42:15,074 --> 01:42:17,864
Silencio.

872
01:42:18,365 --> 01:42:21,323
Silencio.

873
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:25,362
No hay banda.

874
01:42:25,947 --> 01:42:29,196
No hay banda.

875
01:42:29,239 --> 01:42:32,487
No hay orquestra.

876
01:42:33,488 --> 01:42:36,611
Silencio.

877
01:42:35,905 --> 01:42:42,945
Silencio.

878
01:42:37,696 --> 01:42:41,817
Silencio.

879
01:42:43,905 --> 01:42:46,737
Silencio.

880
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:50,402
Silencio.

881
01:42:51,361 --> 01:42:53,818
Rita? - No hay banda.

882
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:57,152
Rita, wake up

883
01:42:58,444 --> 01:43:02,151
- No, no... - It's ok, it's ok.

884
01:43:02,402 --> 01:43:05,151
No it's not ok.

885
01:43:05,402 --> 01:43:08,276
What's wrong?

886
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:11,984
Go with me somewhere...

887
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:18,276
It's 2 o'clock It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

888
01:43:19,692 --> 01:43:22,857
Go with me somewhere...

889
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:28,191
Sure. Now?

890
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,607
Right now!

891
01:45:04,683 --> 01:45:08,057
No hay banda!

892
01:45:08,308 --> 01:45:11,807
There is no band!

893
01:45:12,057 --> 01:45:15,972
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

894
01:45:16,223 --> 01:45:18,805
This is all...

895
01:45:19,057 --> 01:45:21,722
a tape-recording.

896
01:45:21,973 --> 01:45:22,971
No hay banda!

897
01:45:23,222 --> 01:45:28,387
and yet we hear a band.

898
01:45:28,514 --> 01:45:31,929
If we want to hear a clarinette...

899
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,679
listen...

900
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:45,385
Un trombon "?coulisse".

901
01:45:48,012 --> 01:45:52,052
Un trombon "con sordina".

902
01:45:52,178 --> 01:45:59,135
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

903
01:46:01,761 --> 01:46:04,551
Hear le son...

904
01:46:04,761 --> 01:46:09,718
and mute it... drop it...

905
01:46:26,217 --> 01:46:30,382
It's all recorded.

906
01:46:31,592 --> 01:46:36,007
No hay banda!

907
01:46:36,049 --> 01:46:40,964
It's all a tape.

908
01:46:50,089 --> 01:46:52,922
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

909
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,463
It is...

910
01:46:55,715 --> 01:46:59,255
an illusion.

911
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:05,378
Listen...

912
01:48:18,457 --> 01:48:20,706
Senoras y senores...

913
01:48:20,957 --> 01:48:27,079
el club Silencio les presenta la llorona de Los Angeles:

914
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:31,745
Rebekah del Rio.

915
01:53:10,554 --> 01:53:13,010
Betty?

916
01:53:15,429 --> 01:53:17,802
Betty?

917
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:32,884
Donde estas?

918
01:53:44,968 --> 01:53:47,425
Betty?

919
01:56:14,704 --> 01:56:17,827
Hey, pretty little girl...

920
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:21,535
time to wake up.

921
01:57:56,861 --> 01:58:00,360
- Where have you been? - What do you want?

922
01:58:00,611 --> 01:58:04,193
My lamp and dishes...

923
01:58:05,319 --> 01:58:09,192
C'mon Diane, it's been three weeks.

924
01:58:10,652 --> 01:58:14,359
I put your dishes in that box.

925
01:58:33,608 --> 01:58:37,815
- That's my ashtray. - Take it.

926
01:58:49,023 --> 01:58:49,980
Anytime...

927
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:54,354
I'm just making sure, Diane.

928
01:59:02,647 --> 01:59:06,395
- That is it? - Yeah

929
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:15,271
Ah, by the way, those two detectives came by again, looking for you.

930
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:10,057
Camilla!

931
02:00:12,515 --> 02:00:15,638
You've come back!

932
02:01:56,214 --> 02:01:59,504
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

933
02:01:59,756 --> 02:02:01,880
I said:

934
02:02:02,131 --> 02:02:05,587
You drive me wild.

935
02:02:17,295 --> 02:02:20,752
We shouldn't do this anymore...

936
02:02:26,129 --> 02:02:29,251
Don't say that...

937
02:02:33,293 --> 02:02:36,000
Don't ever say that!

938
02:02:36,251 --> 02:02:38,166
Don't Diane,

939
02:02:38,418 --> 02:02:42,291
Stop it... Diane STOP!

940
02:02:42,543 --> 02:02:46,458
I've tried to tell you this before.

941
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:57,874
It's him, isn't it?

942
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:09,956
I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene.

943
02:03:10,207 --> 02:03:12,622
Just watch me...

944
02:03:12,874 --> 02:03:16,497
and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

945
02:03:19,874 --> 02:03:22,039
Don't seat so rigid...

946
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:25,539
just, just relax...

947
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:27,663
You two are here alone...

948
02:03:27,915 --> 02:03:31,496
and it's real comfortable...

949
02:03:31,622 --> 02:03:34,203
like you've known each other forever...

950
02:03:34,455 --> 02:03:38,662
ven if you don't say anything... It's real comfortable.

951
02:03:39,538 --> 02:03:41,286
Hank, can you just clear the set...

952
02:03:41,538 --> 02:03:44,037
there's too many people around here... Let's get this worked out...

953
02:03:44,287 --> 02:03:46,619
Clear the set! Clear the set!

954
02:03:46,871 --> 02:03:49,577
Everyone get another cup of coffee.

955
02:03:49,829 --> 02:03:52,994
- Everyone please! - Can Diane stay?

956
02:03:53,245 --> 02:03:59,285
Yes, true. Diane can stay. Hank, let Diane stay.

957
02:04:04,118 --> 02:04:05,867
Now when she starts to cry...

958
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:09,575
don't pull her toward you.

959
02:04:09,785 --> 02:04:12,783
Let her fall in to you...

960
02:04:13,036 --> 02:04:16,492
Let her fall.

961
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:21,950
When you kiss her...

962
02:04:22,117 --> 02:04:26,449
It's just a continuation of that move

963
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:30,240
There is no break...

964
02:04:54,739 --> 02:04:57,821
Kill the lights!

965
02:05:06,613 --> 02:05:07,862
Don't be mad!

966
02:05:08,113 --> 02:05:11,278
- Don't make it be like this! - Oh, sure.

967
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:14,070
You want me to make this easy for you? No!

968
02:05:14,321 --> 02:05:17,403
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

969
02:05:17,655 --> 02:05:21,653
It's not easy for me!!!

970
02:06:44,271 --> 02:06:45,853
Hello, it's me...

971
02:06:46,104 --> 02:06:49,186
leave a message...

972
02:06:56,728 --> 02:06:59,643
Hello?

973
02:07:02,770 --> 02:07:05,310
Diane, the car is waiting.

974
02:07:05,561 --> 02:07:07,351
Are you ok?

975
02:07:07,603 --> 02:07:10,726
You comin'?

976
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:16,975
Good...

977
02:07:17,226 --> 02:07:20,141
It means so much to me.

978
02:07:20,392 --> 02:07:23,973
Go on... the car is right outside the house..

979
02:07:24,225 --> 02:07:27,640
It's been waiting, ok ?

980
02:07:31,267 --> 02:07:32,973
Ok.

981
02:07:33,225 --> 02:07:37,973
It's 6980, Mulholland drive.

982
02:07:38,225 --> 02:07:41,640
Mulholland drive.

983
02:08:49,842 --> 02:08:54,508
What are you doing? We don't stop here...

984
02:08:57,758 --> 02:09:01,632
A surprise...

985
02:09:22,881 --> 02:09:26,296
Shortcut.

986
02:09:26,881 --> 02:09:29,963
C'mon sweetheart.

987
02:09:34,922 --> 02:09:36,879
It's beautiful.

988
02:09:37,129 --> 02:09:40,586
A secret path.

989
02:10:47,207 --> 02:10:49,705
Ah, perfect timing!

990
02:10:50,123 --> 02:10:53,288
Welcome, Diane.

991
02:10:57,956 --> 02:10:59,996
Well...

992
02:11:00,248 --> 02:11:03,829
Here's to love...

993
02:11:11,954 --> 02:11:14,744
Here's to love...

994
02:11:18,704 --> 02:11:22,036
Ah, here she is...

995
02:11:30,077 --> 02:11:33,617
I don't believe you met my mother...

996
02:11:33,744 --> 02:11:35,993
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

997
02:11:36,244 --> 02:11:38,784
Just call me Coco, everybody does...

998
02:11:39,035 --> 02:11:41,159
- Pleased to meet you... - Let's eat...

999
02:11:41,410 --> 02:11:44,533
I'm starving...

1000
02:11:49,701 --> 02:11:53,325
I'm sorry, I was late.

1001
02:12:12,157 --> 02:12:15,197
I'm from Deep River, Ontario...

1002
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:17,197
a small town.

1003
02:12:17,449 --> 02:12:21,822
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

1004
02:12:22,073 --> 02:12:25,530
I've always wanted to come here.

1005
02:12:25,740 --> 02:12:29,197
I won this ballet contest...

1006
02:12:29,447 --> 02:12:32,820
that sort of led to acting...

1007
02:12:33,239 --> 02:12:37,154
you know, wanting to act.

1008
02:12:37,322 --> 02:12:40,778
When my aunt died...

1009
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:45,487
anyway, she left me so money... she worked here...

1010
02:12:45,737 --> 02:12:48,319
In the movies?

1011
02:12:48,570 --> 02:12:50,902
Yes.

1012
02:12:51,154 --> 02:12:55,152
How did you meet Camilla?

1013
02:12:55,403 --> 02:12:57,485
On a "Sylvia North Story".

1014
02:12:57,736 --> 02:13:01,151
Camilla was great in that.

1015
02:13:14,902 --> 02:13:18,984
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

1016
02:13:19,235 --> 02:13:23,233
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

1017
02:13:25,150 --> 02:13:27,523
The director...

1018
02:13:27,775 --> 02:13:29,857
Bob Brooker?

1019
02:13:30,108 --> 02:13:32,981
Yes.

1020
02:13:34,275 --> 02:13:37,731
Hadn't so much of me...

1021
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:45,231
anyway, that's when we became friends.

1022
02:13:45,482 --> 02:13:47,231
She helped me...

1023
02:13:47,482 --> 02:13:52,522
getting some parts in some of her films.

1024
02:13:53,315 --> 02:13:56,021
I see.

1025
02:14:09,563 --> 02:14:12,145
So, I got the pool...

1026
02:14:12,397 --> 02:14:15,937
and she got the pool-man.

1027
02:14:16,604 --> 02:14:22,186
I couldn't believe it I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

1028
02:14:27,561 --> 02:14:31,018
Sometimes good things happen.

1029
02:15:23,556 --> 02:15:27,347
So, I guess we saved the best for last...

1030
02:15:29,348 --> 02:15:30,596
Do you want to tell them?

1031
02:15:30,847 --> 02:15:34,262
No, you to tell them.

1032
02:15:37,014 --> 02:15:40,428
Camilla and I...

1033
02:15:51,553 --> 02:15:54,968
are going to be...

1034
02:16:05,386 --> 02:16:08,468
Sorry about that.

1035
02:16:15,551 --> 02:16:18,633
No, I'm fine.

1036
02:16:23,218 --> 02:16:26,799
This is the girl.

1037
02:16:27,051 --> 02:16:30,382
Don't show me this photothing here.

1038
02:16:30,633 --> 02:16:35,090
It's just an actress' photo, everybody's got one.

1039
02:16:35,341 --> 02:16:37,798
You got the money?

1040
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:41,173
Sure do.

1041
02:16:51,173 --> 02:16:56,796
Ok, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.

1042
02:16:58,215 --> 02:17:02,504
Are you sure you want this?

1043
02:17:05,922 --> 02:17:09,545
More than anything in this world.

1044
02:17:19,378 --> 02:17:22,877
When it's finished, you'll find this where I told you.

1045
02:17:36,586 --> 02:17:39,922
What's it open?

1046
02:22:04,353 --> 02:22:08,189
Silencio
