1
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,630
What are you doing?
We don't stop here!

2
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:14,006
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:52,714 --> 00:08:54,464
The boys found this..

4
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:57,130
on the floor in back
of the Caddy.

5
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,255
Yeah, they showed me.

6
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,963
Could be unrelated.

7
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:06,589
Could be.

8
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,547
Any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?

9
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:17,214
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

10
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:20,923
That's what I'm thinkin'.

11
00:09:57,547 --> 00:10:01,214
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:48,464
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:51,339
To Winkie's?

14
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:54,631
This Winkie's.

15
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,339
Okay.
Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:05,130
It's kind of embarrassing..

17
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:09,631
Go ahead.

18
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:11,464
I had a dream about this place.

19
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,130
Oh boy.

20
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:16,838
You see what I mean?

21
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:22,089
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

22
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:25,297
Tell me.

23
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,838
Well..

24
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,130
it's the second one I've had..

25
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:36,797
but they are both the same..

26
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,130
they start out that I'm in here but..

27
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:43,381
it's not day or night.

28
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:46,673
It's kinda half night, you know?

29
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:49,506
But it
looks just like this..

30
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:52,838
except for the light.

31
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,214
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

32
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,214
Of all people,

33
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:04,172
you're standing right over there..

34
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:10,631
by that counter.

35
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:16,089
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

36
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:21,673
I get even more frightened when I see
how afraid you are and..

37
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,631
then I realize what it is.

38
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:33,172
There's a man..

39
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:37,047
in back of this place.

40
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:41,422
He's the one who's doing it.

41
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:44,713
I can see him through the wall.

42
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:48,422
I can see his face..

43
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,339
I hope that I never see that face ever..

44
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,631
outside of the dream.

45
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,256
That's it.

46
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,047
So..

47
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:16,713
you came to see if he's out there.

48
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:22,256
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

49
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:27,713
Right then.

50
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,588
It's around here.

51
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:29,339
Dan? You all right?
Dan? Dan?

52
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,381
Hello?

53
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
The girl is still missing.

54
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:23,922
Talk to me.

55
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:27,588
The same.

56
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,714
Oh..
I can't believe it!

57
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:39,755
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

58
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,755
It's been so nice travelling with you.

59
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:45,298
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

60
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:46,964
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

61
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,463
Remember I'll be watching
for you on the big screen.

62
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:53,131
Okay Irene.
Won't that be the day.

63
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,339
Good luck, Betty dear.

64
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,131
Take care of yourself and be careful.

65
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,964
I will. Thanks again.

66
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:06,006
Betty, it was so nice meeting you
All the luck in the world.

67
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:09,547
- Thank you.
- Bye.

68
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:18,589
My bags!

69
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,463
Where to?

70
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:25,172
1612 Havenhurst.

71
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:29,589
Got it!

72
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,173
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

73
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,922
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

74
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:51,922
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

75
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,964
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

76
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,797
- Pleased to meet you.
- Just call me Coco.

77
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:01,464
Everybody else does.
Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

78
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:04,797
OK, Coco.

79
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:10,547
Wilkins?!
Wilkins?!?!

80
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:14,547
If that damned dog craps
in the courtyard one more time..

81
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:18,047
I'm just gonna bake his
little butt for breakfast.

82
00:21:18,297 --> 00:21:20,464
- You don't have pets do you?
- No, I don't.

83
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,327
They're allowed, I just
don't like 'em here..

84
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,964
for obvious reasons.

85
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:26,589
You know, there was a man
that lived here once..

86
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,338
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

87
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,714
Well, you just wouldn't believe..

88
00:21:31,964 --> 00:21:35,755
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

89
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:38,881
Let's see your Aunt's apartment
..it's a good one.

90
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,589
I can hardly wait!

91
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,464
It's unbelievable!

92
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,797
- I told ya.
- Wow!

93
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:58,006
Well, you and your Aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

94
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,797
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

95
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:04,297
Everybody in this building's
pretty much okay with me..

96
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:06,964
or they wouldn't be here.

97
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:10,380
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

98
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,839
No hard feelings if you don't.

99
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:42,672
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was going to be here.

100
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,088
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK

101
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,380
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty.

102
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:52,130
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

103
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,130
There was an accident.

104
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,297
I came here.

105
00:23:56,547 --> 00:23:58,964
I understand.
I saw the dress.

106
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:02,797
Sorry. Are you all right?

107
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,006
What happened?

108
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:08,672
A car..

109
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:12,547
a car accident.

110
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,589
Oh.. You OK?

111
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,631
I think so.

112
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:22,172
I was just..

113
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,172
taking a shower.

114
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,172
Oh my god. I'm sorry.

115
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:31,213
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm going to get unpacked.

116
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:37,797
What's your name?

117
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:45,756
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here
and we can talk later.

118
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,464
My name's..
Rita.

119
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:27,589
Hi..

120
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:30,172
do you work with my Aunt?

121
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,797
- No.. I..
- Sorry..

122
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:38,172
it's none of my business.

123
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,130
She has pretty red hair..

124
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,464
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie..

125
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,464
that's being made in Canada..

126
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:50,130
but I guess you already know that.

127
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,631
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

128
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:56,714
Unless of course I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

129
00:25:56,963 --> 00:26:00,005
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star,

130
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:02,422
but sometimes people end up being both

131
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:08,672
so that is, I guess you'd say,
sort of why I came here.

132
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,339
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited to be here..

133
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:16,922
I mean I just came here
from Deep River, Ontario..

134
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,756
now I'm in this..

135
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:21,714
dream place.

136
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:25,714
You can imagine how I feel.

137
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:35,255
Oh.. What? Sit down..

138
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:41,714
Where were you hurt?

139
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,631
- We should call a doctor.
- No

140
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:47,422
- But, this could be serious.
- No, I..

141
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,255
I need to sleep.

142
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:51,547
If you have a concussion
you shouldn't sleep.

143
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:54,339
It will feel okay if I sleep.

144
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:59,506
I just need to
lie down here and sleep.

145
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:59,172
You see Adam.. there are some suggestions

146
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,381
that are to be brought forward..

147
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:04,547
and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions

148
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,838
and that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

149
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,047
What are you talking about?

150
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:13,672
An open mind..

151
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:16,963
You're in the process of
re-casting your lead actress and

152
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:18,963
I'm..

153
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:24,880
We're asking you to
keep an open mind.

154
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,422
What was it last time?

155
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,172
OK. Let's try the next one.

156
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,714
He's not gonna like it.

157
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:47,047
We'll see.

158
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,589
Ah.. Castigliane brothers.

159
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:58,255
Let me introduce you around..

160
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,464
please.. take a seat.

161
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,755
This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know

162
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:07,422
and this is the director Adam Kesher..

163
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:12,422
and his manager Robert Smith.

164
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:45,755
Oh,

165
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:49,422
She's very pretty.

166
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:54,464
May I offer you, gentlemen..
anything?

167
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,631
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

168
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,838
- What's the photo for?
- An espresso.

169
00:30:02,964 --> 00:30:05,047
No, that's it.

170
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:07,339
I think you're gonna enjoy your espresso
this time.

171
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:11,089
I've done quite a bit of a research
knowing how hard you are to please.

172
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:13,755
This one comes highly recommended.

173
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:16,880
What's the photo for?

174
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,130
It's a recommendation..

175
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:23,297
a recommendation to you, Adam,

176
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:27,297
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

177
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:31,172
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

178
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:35,672
We'd be happy to put her
on the list for consideration.

179
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:41,130
You'd be pleased to know there's quite
a bit of interest in this role.

180
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,672
Interest? No.

181
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,464
There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

182
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,130
This is the girl.

183
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,297
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, Adam.

184
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,297
Hold on?

185
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:57,464
There's no way.
There's no way!

186
00:31:11,214 --> 00:31:13,797
Napkin.

187
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:17,256
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

188
00:31:17,506 --> 00:31:19,964
Of course.

189
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:23,630
Excuse me.

190
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:42,256
Is that all sir?

191
00:32:37,713 --> 00:32:38,672
Shit.

192
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,339
Sorry!
That was a highly recommended..

193
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,839
That's considered one of the finest
espressos in the world, Sir.

194
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,588
What's going on here?
There's no way that girl is in my movie.

195
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,089
HELP ME!

196
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:52,797
This is the girl.

197
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:58,005
Hey!
That girl is not in my film!

198
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:03,256
It's no longer your film.

199
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:10,214
This is the girl.

200
00:33:47,672 --> 00:33:51,089
Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
that limo?

201
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:53,339
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

202
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:57,714
- Yes.
- Keep that door open.

203
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,297
Castigliane brothers?

204
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,964
Beat it, pal.

205
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,339
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

206
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:03,131
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

207
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:07,922
The director doesn't want her.

208
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,797
Do you want him replaced?

209
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:18,172
I know they said..

210
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:21,047
Then?

211
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:23,463
Then..

212
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:27,131
that means we should..

213
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:32,256
Yes?

214
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,256
Shut everything down..

215
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,839
Is that something that..

216
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,339
do you want us..

217
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:44,047
to shut everything down?

218
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:52,256
Then we'll shut everything down.

219
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:23,505
Oh man, that's unheard of..

220
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:28,380
an accident like that..
who could have foreseen that?

221
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:31,047
- That's unreal, right?

222
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:33,797
Hell, yeah.

223
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:37,672
Unbelievable.

224
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:45,006
So, bro.. God you look good!

225
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:47,006
What have you been doin'?

226
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:50,463
Just doin' some stuff
for this guy.

227
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:53,589
Yeah? Making ends meet, huh?

228
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,387
Hardly.

229
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:58,964
I know, man.

230
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:02,089
Look at my digs.

231
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:05,422
Times are tough, bro.

232
00:37:05,714 --> 00:37:09,797
Hey, man,
it's not that bad.

233
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:11,797
I hope you're not goin'
to get in any trouble.

234
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,839
It was just a thing.

235
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:15,839
The story made you laugh.

236
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:21,047
- It was a funny story.
- Fucking car accident.

237
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:26,131
Hey, so that's it?

238
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,214
It's the famous black book.

239
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:37,173
The history of the world
in phone numbers.

240
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:09,714
Oh, man!

241
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,297
Something bit me
BAD!

242
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:01,172
God!

243
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,464
Hey man!

244
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:19,172
She's hurt bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone. Please I need you!

245
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:23,964
She's hurt bad!
You gotta call the hospital

246
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:25,964
Come on man!
I'm serious about this!

247
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:30,297
I can't do everything by myself!

248
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:52,422
Hey man!

249
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:35,922
OH!

250
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:52,964
Okay Aunt Ruth.. I'll try.

251
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:58,213
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know them inside out.

252
00:40:58,464 --> 00:41:01,422
Yep, either here
on this fabulous leather couch..

253
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,422
or I'll take them with a
coffee in the courtyard..

254
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:06,297
like a regular movie star.

255
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,839
Oh! I got a real
shock to find your friend Rita here.

256
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:13,672
She was in the shower and
I opened the door..

257
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:17,505
what do you mean?

258
00:41:17,756 --> 00:41:20,797
She was in an accident.

259
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:25,213
Rita, your friend.

260
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,213
No, Coco unlocked the door.

261
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:32,213
No, she didn't see her.

262
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,339
She's sleeping.

263
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:37,297
I'm sure there's some explanation for this
Aunt Ruth,

264
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:41,297
I don't think we have to do that.

265
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:47,589
Please don't worry..
we don't need the police.

266
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:02,505
You're awake..

267
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:07,297
I think I misunderstood.

268
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:10,964
I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here.

269
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:16,339
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

270
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,839
I'm.. sorry. I..

271
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,547
What is it Rita?

272
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:37,130
I thought when I woke up..

273
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,963
I thought sleep would do it..

274
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:43,088
What's wrong?

275
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,589
I don't know who I am.

276
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:48,797
What do you mean?
You're Rita.

277
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:53,130
I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

278
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,797
I don't know who I am!

279
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:12,005
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

280
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,589
You want to know, don't you?

281
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,547
- I.. yes, but.. I..
- Open it!

282
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:56,672
- You sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.. no thanks.

283
00:44:56,922 --> 00:44:59,547
Not a coke or something?

284
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,297
No.. thanks though..

285
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:05,756
I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.

286
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,255
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

287
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:18,381
Any new girls on the street lately?

288
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:24,797
No. I haven't seen any.

289
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:26,797
A brunette?

290
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:30,464
Maybe a little beat up?

291
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,922
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't
you baby?

292
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:42,922
- Sure.
- You bet you will.

293
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:47,880
That money.

294
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:53,506
You don't know where it came from?

295
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:59,880
When you think of them..
the money.. the key..

296
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:04,755
does it make you remember anything?

297
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:09,179
Something..

298
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:13,422
something there.

299
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,797
What did you say?

300
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,964
They fired everyone.

301
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:30,256
Who fired everyone?

302
00:46:30,506 --> 00:46:34,631
Ray did!
Please I'm talking on the phone,

303
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,797
and then they closed the set..
everybody's gone.

304
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:41,464
You'd better
get down here Adam!

305
00:46:42,797 --> 00:46:45,381
You've got to talk to Ray
you've got to fix this.

306
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:47,089
I'm going home.

307
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:48,631
Home?!

308
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,631
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something..

309
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,631
you've got to do something Adam!

310
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,797
I'm going home, Cynthia.

311
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,880
Adam, this isn't like you.

312
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,547
Please come to the office.

313
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:02,922
- There must be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

314
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:16,297
I wonder where you were going.

315
00:47:19,672 --> 00:47:23,339
Mulholland drive.

316
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:30,214
Mulholland drive?

317
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:32,964
That's where I was going..

318
00:47:33,214 --> 00:47:37,214
Mulholland Drive.

319
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:41,130
Maybe that's where the accident was.

320
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:44,880
There must be a police report.
We could call..

321
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,880
We could call anonymously
from a pay phone..

322
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,047
just to see if there was an accident.

323
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:52,713
Come on. It'll be just like in the movies.

324
00:47:52,964 --> 00:47:56,922
We'll pretend to be someone else.

325
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:59,005
I want to walk around anyway.

326
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:02,464
I'm in Hollywood and I
haven't even seen any of it.

327
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:07,172
Come on Rita.
Do you feel up to it?

328
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:18,713
Okay.. but just

329
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:21,506
just to see.

330
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:25,755
Just to see
if there was an accident..

331
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:29,964
on Mulholland Drive.

332
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,797
Lorraine?

333
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:17,506
Lorraine.. you home?

334
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,256
Lorraine..

335
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,755
Now, you've done it!

336
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:50,381
Just forget you ever saw.
It's better that way.

337
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:56,172
What the hell are you even doing here?

338
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:10,672
What are you doing?

339
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,047
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!

340
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,089
That bastard
You bastard!

341
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:38,006
He's probably upset Lorraine.

342
00:50:42,964 --> 00:50:46,505
WHAT.. ARE.. YOU.. DOING!?

343
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,630
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

344
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,922
Adam, STOP IT!

345
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:55,297
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

346
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:59,964
Adam, STOP IT!

347
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:05,797
What're you doin'
You're hurting me!

348
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,994
That's not a way to
treat your wife, buddy.

349
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:13,131
I don't care what she's done.

350
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:16,297
Throw him out!

351
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:23,630
Throw him out!

352
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:32,422
Get out!

353
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,672
Let's hide it.

354
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,839
There's one.

355
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:16,922
Hollywood Police Department

356
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:20,672
I'm inquiring about an accident that
happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

357
00:53:20,922 --> 00:53:24,797
Hold please.
I'll connect you to traffic.

358
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,297
- Sergeant Baxter,
- Hi. I'm inquiring..

359
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:34,006
well, I heard a sound last night
that sounded sort of like a carcrash and

360
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:38,131
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

361
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,131
Yes, there was.

362
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,256
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No. I can't.

363
00:53:43,505 --> 00:53:47,797
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name please?

364
00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:55,297
There was an accident.

365
00:53:55,547 --> 00:53:57,338
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident Rita.

366
00:53:57,589 --> 00:54:01,012
I just know it was.

367
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:03,464
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

368
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:07,464
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee
and we can see.

369
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:13,630
Maybe it happened so late it's not going
to be in today's paper.

370
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:17,338
There's nothing?

371
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:20,964
Not that I can see.

372
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:24,297
That's Ok.

373
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:28,173
Thanks..

374
00:54:28,422 --> 00:54:33,173
Diane.

375
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:39,797
That'd be all?
You want your check?

376
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:43,380
Rita, you want something?

377
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:50,630
- No. Just the coffee.
- I'll take our check.

378
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:59,922
- What is it Rita?
- Shhhh.

379
00:55:06,464 --> 00:55:09,922
I remember something..

380
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:17,464
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

381
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:21,672
Maybe that's my name.

382
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:29,380
D. Selwyn.. it's the only one.

383
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,089
I'm gonna call.

384
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,964
It's strange to be calling yourself.

385
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,672
Maybe it's not me.

386
00:55:51,964 --> 00:55:53,714
Hello.. this is me.

387
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:57,338
Leave me a message.

388
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:01,380
It's not my voice..

389
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,089
but I know her.

390
00:56:05,505 --> 00:56:08,839
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

391
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:11,130
Maybe that's your roommate..

392
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,589
or if it is Diane Selwyn..

393
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,881
she can tell you who you are.

394
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:22,797
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

395
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:04,631
- Yeah, right.. get lost!
- Is this Adam Kesher's house?

396
00:57:04,881 --> 00:57:06,422
Like hell it is! Get out.. NOW!

397
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:09,756
Get out!

398
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:22,088
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

399
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:25,589
I guess you don't understand English.
She said to leave.

400
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,589
Here's the door.

401
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:32,964
OUT!

402
00:58:01,422 --> 00:58:04,047
- Yeah.. what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry Mr. Kesher..

403
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:08,130
but there seems tobe some problem
with your credit cards.

404
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,631
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

405
00:58:14,672 --> 00:58:17,756
Fact is two guys from your bank came by.

406
00:58:18,005 --> 00:58:20,422
My bank?

407
00:58:20,672 --> 00:58:24,881
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

408
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:26,172
What did they say?

409
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:30,714
I'm afraid they said
you're maxed out at your bank..

410
00:58:30,964 --> 00:58:35,756
and your line of credit
has been cancelled.

411
00:58:35,964 --> 00:58:39,339
It's unbelievable.

412
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:42,714
Look..

413
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:46,631
I don't know what's going on.

414
00:58:46,881 --> 00:58:50,339
That's so much baloney.

415
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:53,380
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

416
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,714
I know.. I know..

417
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:57,756
Don't worry..

418
00:58:58,005 --> 00:59:00,631
I'm sorry.

419
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:04,297
It was my duty to inform you.

420
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:12,464
People you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

421
00:59:12,756 --> 00:59:15,714
Right.

422
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:18,881
I'm sorry

423
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:42,172
Hello?

424
00:59:42,422 --> 00:59:44,214
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

425
00:59:44,464 --> 00:59:46,214
I know.
Where are you Adam?

426
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:48,506
What do you mean you know?

427
00:59:48,756 --> 00:59:50,506
Somebody called. When
they couldn't get you..

428
00:59:50,756 --> 00:59:52,922
they told me you were as good as broke.

429
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,214
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

430
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:57,631
- And?
- You're broke!

431
00:59:57,881 --> 00:59:59,255
But I'm not broke!

432
00:59:59,506 --> 01:00:03,756
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

433
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:06,297
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

434
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:10,963
Do you know somebody
called the "The Cowboy"?

435
01:00:11,214 --> 01:00:13,339
- "The Cowboy"?
- Yes

436
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:15,047
Yeah, the Cowboy.

437
01:00:15,297 --> 01:00:18,172
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

438
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:22,297
Jason said he thought it
would be a good idea.

439
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:25,631
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea
for me to go to see the Cowboy.

440
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,005
Should I wear my ten gallon
hat and my six shooters?

441
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:33,756
Listen. Something tells me this guy
is connected to what's happening,

442
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,672
and I think you should do it and I
think you should do it right away.

443
01:00:37,922 --> 01:00:39,672
What's going on, Cynthia?

444
01:00:39,922 --> 01:00:43,839
It's been a very strange day..

445
01:00:44,214 --> 01:00:47,631
and getting stranger.

446
01:00:48,506 --> 01:00:52,422
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean..
do I have to ride out to the range?

447
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:54,714
Sort of, funny boy.

448
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:56,798
If I tell him the
meeting's on..

449
01:00:57,047 --> 01:00:59,672
you have to go to the top of
Beachwood Canyon.

450
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,756
There's a corral up there where he'll be.

451
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:06,464
You've got to be kidding me!

452
01:01:06,714 --> 01:01:08,880
Will you meet with him?

453
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,172
Yeah, sure.

454
01:01:11,422 --> 01:01:14,547
It's been that kind of a day.
When?

455
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:16,714
I'll call him, right away..

456
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:19,464
then I'll call you back.

457
01:01:19,714 --> 01:01:24,631
You could stay at my
place, if you want it.

458
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,838
Cynthia.. I don't think
it'll be a good idea.

459
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:29,172
I'm just offering a place to stay.

460
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:32,464
And I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

461
01:01:32,714 --> 01:01:35,922
Now go on and give the Cowboy a yodel
and get back to me.

462
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:39,673
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

463
01:01:39,922 --> 01:01:44,714
Just get along little
dowgie and call me back.

464
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:57,339
It's right about here on Sierra Bonita.

465
01:01:57,589 --> 01:02:00,422
That's not too far away.

466
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,464
What's wrong with that?

467
01:02:03,714 --> 01:02:07,172
I'm not sure about this.

468
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:10,838
I know you're afraid of something.

469
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:14,756
We'll be careful. Promise.

470
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:18,255
Tomorrow we'll go over there..

471
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:22,047
and we'll find out.

472
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:36,880
It'll be okay.

473
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:41,714
It's probabily Coco

474
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:44,922
Yes?

475
01:02:45,172 --> 01:02:46,339
May I help you?

476
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:50,214
Someone is in trouble.

477
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:53,214
Who are you?

478
01:02:53,464 --> 01:02:56,130
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

479
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,297
She's letting me stay here.

480
01:02:58,547 --> 01:03:00,964
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

481
01:03:01,214 --> 01:03:02,755
No it's not.

482
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:05,422
That's not what she said.

483
01:03:05,673 --> 01:03:10,172
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

484
01:03:10,422 --> 01:03:13,755
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are
and..

485
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:18,464
Louise..
What are you doing Louise?

486
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:22,631
Oh, Coco! I've been trying to find
you all afternoon since 3:00 o'clock.

487
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,047
That one is in my room
and she won't leave.

488
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:29,964
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

489
01:03:30,214 --> 01:03:32,797
This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she
meant well.

490
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:36,964
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

491
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:40,089
In fact and fortunately I was
just on my way here to see Betty.

492
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:42,880
Betty's a young actress and
I was just delivering..

493
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:46,297
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

494
01:03:46,548 --> 01:03:49,130
- Well, here they are honey.
- Oh, thank you.

495
01:03:49,381 --> 01:03:51,797
Now come along Louise
and I'll take you home.

496
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:54,755
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes.
Come on.

497
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:57,339
No, she said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

498
01:03:57,589 --> 01:04:00,506
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home..

499
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:02,589
Come on.

500
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,422
- Goodnight Betty.
- Goodnight.

501
01:04:05,672 --> 01:04:08,755
Goodnight.

502
01:04:46,713 --> 01:04:49,672
Cowboy!

503
01:05:56,588 --> 01:06:00,755
- Howdy!
- Howdy to you.

504
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:04,630
Beautiful evening.

505
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,964
Sure want to thank ya for coming
all the way up to see me..

506
01:06:10,214 --> 01:06:14,026
from that nice hotel Downtown.

507
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:17,839
No problem.
What's on your mind?

508
01:06:18,089 --> 01:06:22,423
Well now, here's a man who wants to get
right down to it.

509
01:06:22,672 --> 01:06:25,297
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

510
01:06:25,547 --> 01:06:28,464
Whatever.

511
01:06:28,922 --> 01:06:31,381
A man's attitude..

512
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:34,256
a man's attitude
goes some ways

513
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:37,131
the way his life will be.

514
01:06:37,381 --> 01:06:40,464
Is that somethin' you might agree with?

515
01:06:40,714 --> 01:06:42,339
Sure.

516
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:46,256
Now.. did you answer because you thought
that's what I wanted to hear..

517
01:06:46,505 --> 01:06:48,547
or did you think about what I said..

518
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:53,755
and answer cause you
truly believe that to be right?

519
01:06:54,005 --> 01:06:59,547
I agree with what you said.. truly.

520
01:06:59,797 --> 01:07:03,256
What did I say?

521
01:07:04,547 --> 01:07:09,797
That a man's attitude determines to a
large extent how his life will be.

522
01:07:09,922 --> 01:07:12,339
So since you agree..

523
01:07:12,588 --> 01:07:17,423
you must be a person who does
not care about the good life.

524
01:07:17,672 --> 01:07:21,381
How's that?

525
01:07:21,463 --> 01:07:25,297
Well, stop for a little second and
think about it.

526
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:29,297
Can you do that for me?

527
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:34,714
Okay, I'm thinking.

528
01:07:36,672 --> 01:07:38,505
No. You're not thinkin'

529
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:42,880
You're too busy being a
smart aleck to be thinkin'.

530
01:07:43,131 --> 01:07:47,256
Now I want ya to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

531
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:49,672
Can you try that for me?

532
01:07:49,922 --> 01:07:54,463
Look.. where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

533
01:07:54,714 --> 01:07:57,131
There's sometimes a buggy.

534
01:07:57,381 --> 01:08:00,505
How many drivers does a buggy have?

535
01:08:00,755 --> 01:08:02,505
One.

536
01:08:02,755 --> 01:08:05,797
So let's just say I'm
drivin' this buggy..

537
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:10,797
and you if fix your attitude you can
ride along with me.

538
01:08:11,214 --> 01:08:12,339
Okay.

539
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,381
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

540
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,922
You were re-casting the lead
actress anyway..

541
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:23,089
audition many girls for
the part.

542
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:28,131
When you see the girl that was
shown to you earlier today, you will say:

543
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:31,505
"This is the girl".

544
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:34,089
The rest of the cast can stay.

545
01:08:34,339 --> 01:08:36,797
That is up to you.

546
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:41,422
But that lead girl is not up to you.

547
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:44,630
Now, you will see me one more time..

548
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,298
if you do good.

549
01:08:47,547 --> 01:08:50,422
You will see me two more times..

550
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:52,839
if you do bad.

551
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:56,214
Good night.

552
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:21,463
You're still here?

553
01:09:21,714 --> 01:09:24,338
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

554
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:27,172
Nobody wants you here!

555
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:29,089
Really?

556
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:31,797
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

557
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:36,047
- So.. surprise..
- I can call them.. I can call my dad..

558
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:38,298
But you won't..

559
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:41,672
If you're trying to blackmail me..
it's not going to work.

560
01:09:41,922 --> 01:09:43,755
You're playing a dangerous game here.

561
01:09:44,006 --> 01:09:46,172
You know what I want..
it's not that difficult.

562
01:09:46,422 --> 01:09:49,797
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad..

563
01:09:50,047 --> 01:09:53,006
he trusts you..
you're his best friend.

564
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,547
This will be the end of everything.

565
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:58,839
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

566
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:03,422
Stop! Just stop! That's what you said
from the beginning.

567
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:06,589
If I tell what happened..
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

568
01:10:06,839 --> 01:10:08,672
So get out of here before..

569
01:10:08,922 --> 01:10:12,256
Before what?

570
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:15,547
Before I kill you.

571
01:10:15,797 --> 01:10:19,630
Then they'd put you in jail.

572
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:25,089
Then I cry, cry, cry, and
then I say with big emotion:

573
01:10:25,338 --> 01:10:29,589
"I hate you.. I hate us both!"

574
01:10:31,214 --> 01:10:32,755
Such a lame scene.

575
01:10:33,006 --> 01:10:36,089
But you are really good.

576
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:39,422
Thank you dahling!

577
01:10:53,422 --> 01:10:54,297
Hi there!

578
01:10:54,547 --> 01:10:57,672
Who are you?

579
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:11,964
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

580
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:29,922
- What is it Coco?
- Your aunt called

581
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:31,380
I was afraid of that.

582
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,547
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

583
01:11:35,945 --> 01:11:38,695
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

584
01:11:38,945 --> 01:11:41,195
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad..

585
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:44,278
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

586
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:46,528
I kept telling her it
was my friend Rita..

587
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:50,320
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas..

588
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,445
Look at me straight, sweetie.

589
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,612
Coco.. she's very nice.

590
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:56,445
Honey.. you're a good kid.

591
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:59,862
What you're telling me
is a load of horse-pucky

592
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:02,737
even though it comes from a good place.

593
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:06,112
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out

594
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:09,820
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

595
01:12:10,071 --> 01:12:12,195
Louise Bonner says there's
trouble in there.

596
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:14,195
Remember last night?

597
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:17,820
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

598
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:23,320
but if there is trouble
get rid of it.

599
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,987
Is everything all right?

600
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:35,946
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

601
01:12:36,195 --> 01:12:39,320
No, no, everything is A-okay.

602
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:41,570
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

603
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:46,278
And my audition is in one hour.

604
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,445
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

605
01:13:07,695 --> 01:13:10,612
- Don't drink all the coke.
- Good luck!

606
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:13,946
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.

607
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:17,612
- Okay.
- Okay?

608
01:13:44,946 --> 01:13:46,820
Voilà!

609
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:49,904
Betty Elms, I'd like you to meet..

610
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:53,070
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

611
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,946
Woody Katz who we've
cast in the part..

612
01:13:55,195 --> 01:13:59,195
of "Chuck".
He'll do the scene with you.

613
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:01,111
Bob Brooker, the director

614
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:03,904
and Julie Chadwick..

615
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:06,445
Now, our surprise guest is:

616
01:14:06,695 --> 01:14:08,737
Linney James.

617
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:11,070
Alas we can't afford her to cast our show,

618
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,946
but as casting agents go..

619
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:16,654
she's the best.

620
01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:19,779
Why thank you, Wally.
Hello Betty.

621
01:14:20,029 --> 01:14:21,737
Very pleased to meet you.

622
01:14:21,987 --> 01:14:25,695
This is my assistant, Nicki.

623
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:28,028
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

624
01:14:28,278 --> 01:14:32,153
Martha Johnson, who
you met out front.

625
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:34,612
Hi.

626
01:14:34,862 --> 01:14:39,070
So shall we get it to go?

627
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,821
Would you like a water or a coffee
before we begin?

628
01:14:43,070 --> 01:14:44,821
No, no, I'm fine.

629
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:50,070
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

630
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:57,737
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

631
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:00,612
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say..

632
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:03,737
something to Betty before we begin?

633
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:07,862
No.. it's not a contest,

634
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:13,570
the two of them with themselves,

635
01:15:13,946 --> 01:15:17,487
so don't play it for real..

636
01:15:17,737 --> 01:15:22,195
until it gets real.

637
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:27,737
Okay.

638
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,362
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

639
01:15:30,612 --> 01:15:31,529
What?

640
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:33,779
Hey Bobby, I want to play
this one nice and close,

641
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:35,737
like
we did with that other girl,

642
01:15:35,986 --> 01:15:37,246
what's her name? The one
with the black hair.

643
01:15:37,259 --> 01:15:38,529
That felt kinda good.

644
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:40,278
- Whaddya think?
- That's good, Woody.

645
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:42,821
Just don't rush that line again.

646
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:47,529
I told you..
the line where you say, "Before what?"

647
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:50,320
Bobby, acting is reacting..

648
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,945
I just play off 'em. They all say:

649
01:15:54,195 --> 01:15:55,904
"They're gonna arrest you" like that..

650
01:15:56,153 --> 01:15:58,028
"put you in jail"..
They all say it the same way,

651
01:15:58,278 --> 01:16:00,487
so I react like that.

652
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:02,737
- What's your name?
- Betty

653
01:16:02,986 --> 01:16:07,487
Yeah.. Betty, look.. You don't rush it.
I don't rush it.

654
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:10,487
We're gonna play it nice and close..

655
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:15,153
just like in the movies. OK?

656
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:19,654
Dad's best friend goes to work.

657
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:28,612
And.. ACTION!

658
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:35,619
You're still here?

659
01:16:35,654 --> 01:16:39,070
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

660
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,362
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

661
01:16:42,612 --> 01:16:46,779
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

662
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:49,112
So.. surprise!

663
01:16:49,362 --> 01:16:52,570
I can call them..
I can call my dad..

664
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:55,903
But you won't..

665
01:17:10,404 --> 01:17:14,487
You're playing a dangerous game here..

666
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:17,529
if you're trying to blackmail me..

667
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:21,278
it's not gonna work.

668
01:17:21,696 --> 01:17:23,945
You know what I want..

669
01:17:24,195 --> 01:17:27,654
It's not that difficult.

670
01:17:29,195 --> 01:17:32,278
Get out..

671
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,070
Get out before I call my dad.

672
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,404
He trusts you..

673
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,612
You're..

674
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:43,987
his best friend.

675
01:17:46,737 --> 01:17:50,696
This will be the end of everything.

676
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:55,779
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

677
01:17:56,028 --> 01:17:58,487
Stop..

678
01:17:58,737 --> 01:18:01,820
stop it!

679
01:18:02,195 --> 01:18:05,654
That's what you said from the beginning.

680
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:08,779
If I tell them what happened..
they'll arrest you..

681
01:18:09,028 --> 01:18:12,445
and put you in jail,

682
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:20,070
so get out of here..

683
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,237
before..

684
01:18:25,362 --> 01:18:28,487
Before what?

685
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,028
Before..

686
01:18:48,279 --> 01:18:51,778
I kill you.

687
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:09,028
Then they'd put you in jail.

688
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:19,903
I hate you..

689
01:19:20,362 --> 01:19:23,778
I hate us both!

690
01:19:37,987 --> 01:19:42,529
- I'm going to take her over there.
- Yeah big time!

691
01:19:45,237 --> 01:19:47,903
Wow!
Well, there it was.

692
01:19:48,154 --> 01:19:50,362
There it was all right!

693
01:19:50,612 --> 01:19:54,945
Baby, you got away with it!

694
01:19:57,112 --> 01:19:59,820
Very good. Really.

695
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:02,529
I mean it was forced maybe..

696
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:06,612
but still humanistic.

697
01:20:06,862 --> 01:20:07,612
Yeah,

698
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:09,612
very good,

699
01:20:09,862 --> 01:20:13,945
really.

700
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:21,154
Oh I thank you Betty..

701
01:20:21,404 --> 01:20:23,862
and I really mean that sincerely.

702
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:28,112
I mean, it was extraordinary.

703
01:20:28,362 --> 01:20:29,862
You've done your Aunt proud..

704
01:20:30,112 --> 01:20:34,070
and I'm going to tell her
the first chance I get.

705
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,571
Now, you and I..

706
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,571
are gonna speak again soon.

707
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,945
Thank you Mr. Brown.

708
01:20:41,195 --> 01:20:42,945
Thank you, Wally.

709
01:20:43,195 --> 01:20:46,320
I'm sure you all have a lot to
talk about. We'll walk Betty out.

710
01:20:46,571 --> 01:20:50,320
Well, yes indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

711
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:52,945
Don't you be a stranger around here.

712
01:20:53,195 --> 01:20:56,112
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

713
01:20:56,362 --> 01:20:57,945
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

714
01:20:58,195 --> 01:21:02,571
It was nice meeting all of you.

715
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:11,695
Wow!

716
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,695
How do you find her..

717
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:17,404
God, that was awful!

718
01:21:17,653 --> 01:21:20,070
Not you Betty.
You were stellar and I mean that

719
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,945
But poor Wally.

720
01:21:22,195 --> 01:21:24,112
- He'll never get that picture made.
- Why?

721
01:21:24,362 --> 01:21:26,487
Wally's days were up twenty years ago.

722
01:21:26,737 --> 01:21:29,695
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor?

723
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:31,903
And the cast is terrible..

724
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:34,028
Oh, God, terrible

725
01:21:34,279 --> 01:21:36,404
Poor old fool Wally..

726
01:21:36,653 --> 01:21:40,404
It was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

727
01:21:40,653 --> 01:21:43,446
And Wally.. Mr. Brown..
is a very close friendof my Aunt's, so..

728
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:46,446
Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
I love Wally.

729
01:21:46,695 --> 01:21:50,154
I ought to. I was married
to him for ten years.

730
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:53,237
And I love actors, all actors.

731
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:56,571
We just get a little catty sometimes.

732
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,320
Now we want to take you across
and introduce you to a director..

733
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:01,237
who's a head above the rest

734
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:04,279
He's got a project that you would kill!

735
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:08,029
Knock it right out of the park.

736
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,820
Cut it! Thank you very
much, Carol. I'm coming back.

737
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,279
Checking the gate?
Checking the gate!

738
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:07,279
Thank you!
Will tell you what happens next!

739
01:24:07,528 --> 01:24:10,570
Thank you very much, for coming in
I know how busy you are.

740
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,246
Oh, are you kidding me?
I love this script!

741
01:24:12,259 --> 01:24:13,695
Show me where to sign!

742
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:15,695
Look.. I love you..

743
01:24:15,945 --> 01:24:18,445
but there's no way they're gonna let me
cast this thing until I've seen everyone.

744
01:24:18,695 --> 01:24:20,445
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

745
01:24:20,695 --> 01:24:24,570
Cause my manager's gonna be bugging
you day and night.. and me.

746
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:25,850
It'll be my pleasure.
Now, get out of here.

747
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:26,904
Oh, you're just
so cruel to me..

748
01:24:27,154 --> 01:24:29,279
don't forget me. I'm the girl
that's going to play this part.

749
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:32,778
See ya later.

750
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:35,070
Hank.. where's Hank?

751
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:39,029
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

752
01:24:39,112 --> 01:24:42,196
- Is she ready?
- Already.

753
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:46,362
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes next.

754
01:24:51,196 --> 01:24:55,987
Sylvia North's story,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

755
01:24:56,112 --> 01:24:58,737
Ok, here we go..
Let's lock it up, please!

756
01:24:58,987 --> 01:25:01,237
- Roll sound please..
- That's it!

757
01:25:01,486 --> 01:25:04,945
Playback!
ACTION!

758
01:25:35,112 --> 01:25:36,987
Get Jason over here.

759
01:25:37,237 --> 01:25:41,279
Cindy.. Adam wants to see Jason.

760
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:21,738
Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

761
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:36,029
This is the girl!

762
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:44,196
Excellent choice, Adam.

763
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:56,487
Oh.. my goodness.

764
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,945
I have to be somewhere.

765
01:27:07,196 --> 01:27:10,278
I promised a friend.

766
01:27:10,528 --> 01:27:14,196
I'm sorry. I must go..

767
01:27:38,403 --> 01:27:40,945
It should be around here..

768
01:27:41,196 --> 01:27:43,528
2590.. That's it.

769
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:45,278
Up there!

770
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:47,989
- Does it look familiar?
- No.

771
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,112
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?!

772
01:27:58,362 --> 01:28:02,695
- Those men in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?!

773
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,112
- No.. but..
- Keep going.

774
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:07,779
Go around to the back.

775
01:28:55,445 --> 01:28:58,904
Selwyn.. number 12.

776
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:24,570
Now, you've got me scared.

777
01:29:48,111 --> 01:29:52,904
See, I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of!

778
01:30:54,779 --> 01:30:57,195
Betty wait.. wait

779
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,237
Oh no.. don't.

780
01:31:25,695 --> 01:31:27,278
No one's home.

781
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:30,821
Yes?

782
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:39,362
Number 17.

783
01:31:39,403 --> 01:31:42,570
But it said number 12.

784
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:47,570
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

785
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:51,153
It's down in the end on the left.

786
01:31:54,695 --> 01:31:58,445
She hasn't been around for a few days..

787
01:31:59,986 --> 01:32:03,904
- Oh.. we'll leave her a note.
- I'll go with you.

788
01:32:05,904 --> 01:32:09,362
She's still got some of my stuff.

789
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:17,362
You go ahead.
I've got to get that.

790
01:32:31,654 --> 01:32:33,779
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

791
01:32:34,028 --> 01:32:37,487
Guess I'm not.

792
01:33:12,945 --> 01:33:16,445
Still no one's home I guess.

793
01:33:44,654 --> 01:33:46,112
- What are you doing?
- C'mon!

794
01:33:46,362 --> 01:33:49,070
C'mon help me in. Come on.

795
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,737
I'll open the front door.

796
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,404
C'mon.

797
01:36:31,612 --> 01:36:35,028
I know what you're doing.

798
01:36:54,778 --> 01:36:58,195
I know what you have to do,

799
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:03,279
but let me do it.

800
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,279
Let me do it.

801
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,820
You look like someone else.

802
01:38:00,487 --> 01:38:02,737
Good night, Betty.

803
01:38:02,987 --> 01:38:04,778
You don't wear it in the house.

804
01:38:05,028 --> 01:38:06,903
What?

805
01:38:07,154 --> 01:38:09,903
The wig.

806
01:38:10,154 --> 01:38:13,279
Just I'm looking at myself again..

807
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:15,237
I'll take it off to sleep.

808
01:38:15,487 --> 01:38:17,695
And you don't have to sleep on that couch.

809
01:38:17,945 --> 01:38:19,945
No, it's okay.

810
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:23,112
No it's not.
This is a huge bed.

811
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:26,903
C'mon, just get in and
get a good night sleep.

812
01:38:57,695 --> 01:39:01,362
It's more confortable
than the couch, isn't it?

813
01:39:01,611 --> 01:39:04,446
Yes.

814
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:13,112
Thank you, Betty.

815
01:39:13,154 --> 01:39:15,154
It's nothing.

816
01:39:15,404 --> 01:39:17,529
I shouldn't have let you sleep
on the couch last night.

817
01:39:17,778 --> 01:39:20,321
No.. I mean..

818
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:24,945
Thank you for everything.

819
01:39:26,778 --> 01:39:30,195
You're welcome.

820
01:39:38,862 --> 01:39:42,321
Good night, sweet Betty.

821
01:39:50,862 --> 01:39:53,987
Good night.

822
01:40:34,653 --> 01:40:38,446
Have you ever done this before?

823
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:40,904
I don't know!

824
01:40:41,154 --> 01:40:44,279
Have you?

825
01:40:56,612 --> 01:41:00,404
I want to with you..

826
01:41:25,237 --> 01:41:28,945
I'm in love with you.

827
01:41:42,321 --> 01:41:46,029
I'm in love with you.

828
01:42:11,695 --> 01:42:14,528
Silencio.

829
01:42:15,487 --> 01:42:18,279
Silencio.

830
01:42:18,778 --> 01:42:21,737
Silencio.

831
01:42:22,653 --> 01:42:25,778
No hay banda.

832
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:29,612
No hay banda.

833
01:42:29,653 --> 01:42:32,904
No hay orquestra.

834
01:42:33,904 --> 01:42:43,361
Silencio.

835
01:42:44,321 --> 01:42:47,154
Silencio.

836
01:42:47,987 --> 01:42:50,820
Silencio.

837
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:54,237
- Rita?
- No hay banda.

838
01:42:54,487 --> 01:42:57,570
Rita, wake up

839
01:42:58,862 --> 01:43:02,570
- No, no..
- It's ok, it's ok.

840
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:05,570
No it's not ok.

841
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:08,695
What's wrong?

842
01:43:08,945 --> 01:43:12,403
Go with me somewhere..

843
01:43:13,237 --> 01:43:18,695
It's 2 o'clock
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

844
01:43:20,112 --> 01:43:23,279
Go with me somewhere..

845
01:43:23,528 --> 01:43:27,613
Sure. Now?

846
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:31,031
Right now!

847
01:45:05,112 --> 01:45:08,487
No hay banda!

848
01:45:08,737 --> 01:45:12,236
There is no band!

849
01:45:12,487 --> 01:45:16,403
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

850
01:45:16,654 --> 01:45:19,236
This is all..

851
01:45:19,487 --> 01:45:22,154
a tape-recording.

852
01:45:22,403 --> 01:45:23,403
No hay banda!

853
01:45:23,654 --> 01:45:28,820
And yet
we hear a band.

854
01:45:28,946 --> 01:45:32,362
If we want to hear a clarinette..

855
01:45:32,612 --> 01:45:35,112
listen..

856
01:45:40,528 --> 01:45:45,820
Un trombon "à coulisse".

857
01:45:48,445 --> 01:45:52,487
Un trombon "con sordina".

858
01:45:52,612 --> 01:45:59,570
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

859
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:04,987
Hear le son..

860
01:46:05,195 --> 01:46:10,153
and mute it.. drop it..

861
01:46:26,654 --> 01:46:30,820
It's all recorded.

862
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:36,445
No hay banda!

863
01:46:36,487 --> 01:46:41,403
It's all a tape.

864
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:53,362
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

865
01:46:53,612 --> 01:46:55,904
It is..

866
01:46:56,153 --> 01:46:59,695
an illusion.

867
01:47:02,862 --> 01:47:05,820
Listen..

868
01:48:18,904 --> 01:48:21,153
Senoras y senores..

869
01:48:21,403 --> 01:48:27,529
el club Silencio les presenta
la llorona de Los Angeles:

870
01:48:27,779 --> 01:48:32,195
Rebekah del Rio.

871
01:53:11,028 --> 01:53:13,487
Betty?

872
01:53:15,903 --> 01:53:18,279
Betty?

873
01:53:29,736 --> 01:53:33,362
Donde estas?

874
01:53:45,446 --> 01:53:47,903
Betty?

875
01:56:15,195 --> 01:56:18,321
Hey, pretty little girl..

876
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:22,029
time to wake up.

877
01:57:57,362 --> 01:58:00,862
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

878
01:58:01,112 --> 01:58:04,695
My lamp and dishes..

879
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:09,695
C'mon Diane,
it's been three weeks.

880
01:58:11,154 --> 01:58:14,862
I put your dishes in that box.

881
01:58:34,112 --> 01:58:38,321
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

882
01:58:49,528 --> 01:58:50,487
Anytime..

883
01:58:50,737 --> 01:58:54,862
I'm just making sure, Diane.

884
01:59:03,154 --> 01:59:06,904
- This is it?
- Yeah

885
01:59:10,987 --> 01:59:15,779
Ah, by the way, those two detectives
came by again, looking for you.

886
02:00:07,904 --> 02:00:10,570
Camilla!

887
02:00:13,029 --> 02:00:16,154
You've come back!

888
02:01:56,737 --> 02:02:00,029
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

889
02:02:00,278 --> 02:02:02,403
I said:

890
02:02:02,654 --> 02:02:06,112
"You drive me wild".

891
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:21,278
We shouldn't do this anymore..

892
02:02:26,654 --> 02:02:29,779
Don't say that..

893
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:36,528
Don't ever say that!

894
02:02:36,779 --> 02:02:38,695
Don't Diane,

895
02:02:38,946 --> 02:02:42,820
Stop it..
Diane STOP!

896
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:46,987
I've tried to tell you this before.

897
02:02:54,654 --> 02:02:58,403
It's him, isn't it?

898
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:10,487
I'm not trying to show
you how to do the scene.

899
02:03:10,737 --> 02:03:13,153
Just watch me..

900
02:03:13,403 --> 02:03:17,029
and I think you'll understand
what I'm getting at.

901
02:03:20,403 --> 02:03:22,570
Don't seat so rigid..

902
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:26,071
just, just relax..

903
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,195
The two of you are alone..

904
02:03:28,445 --> 02:03:32,029
and it's real comfortable..

905
02:03:32,153 --> 02:03:34,737
like you've known each other forever..

906
02:03:34,987 --> 02:03:39,195
even if you don't say anything..
It's real comfortable.

907
02:03:40,071 --> 02:03:41,820
Hank, can you just clear the set..

908
02:03:42,071 --> 02:03:44,570
there's too many people around here..
Let's get this worked out..

909
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:47,153
Clear the set!
Clear the set!

910
02:03:47,403 --> 02:03:50,111
Everyone get a cup of coffee.

911
02:03:50,362 --> 02:03:53,529
- Everyone please!
- Can Diane stay?

912
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:59,821
Yes, true. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

913
02:04:04,654 --> 02:04:06,403
Now when she starts to cry..

914
02:04:06,654 --> 02:04:10,111
don't pull her toward you.

915
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,320
Let her fall in to you..

916
02:04:13,570 --> 02:04:17,029
Let her fall.

917
02:04:19,029 --> 02:04:22,487
When you kiss her..

918
02:04:22,654 --> 02:04:26,987
It's just a continuation of that move

919
02:04:27,737 --> 02:04:30,779
There is no break..

920
02:04:55,278 --> 02:04:58,362
Kill the lights!

921
02:05:07,153 --> 02:05:08,403
Don't be mad!

922
02:05:08,654 --> 02:05:11,821
- Don't make it be like this!
- Oh, sure.

923
02:05:12,070 --> 02:05:14,612
You want me to make this easy for you? No!

924
02:05:14,862 --> 02:05:17,946
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

925
02:05:18,195 --> 02:05:22,195
It's not easy for me!

926
02:06:44,821 --> 02:06:46,404
Hello, it's me..

927
02:06:46,654 --> 02:06:49,737
leave a message..

928
02:06:57,278 --> 02:07:00,195
Hello?

929
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,862
Diane, the car is waiting.

930
02:07:06,112 --> 02:07:07,903
Are you ok?

931
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:11,278
You comin'?

932
02:07:15,861 --> 02:07:17,529
Good..

933
02:07:17,779 --> 02:07:20,696
It means so much to me.

934
02:07:20,945 --> 02:07:24,529
Go on.. the car is right
outside the house..

935
02:07:24,779 --> 02:07:28,195
It's been waiting, ok?

936
02:07:31,821 --> 02:07:33,529
Ok.

937
02:07:33,779 --> 02:07:38,529
It's 6980, Mulholland drive.

938
02:07:38,779 --> 02:07:42,195
Mulholland drive.

939
02:08:50,404 --> 02:08:55,070
What are you doing?
We don't stop here..

940
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:02,195
A surprise..

941
02:09:23,445 --> 02:09:26,862
Shortcut.

942
02:09:27,445 --> 02:09:30,529
C'mon sweetheart.

943
02:09:35,487 --> 02:09:37,445
It's beautiful.

944
02:09:37,696 --> 02:09:41,154
A secret path.

945
02:10:47,778 --> 02:10:50,279
Ah, perfect timing!

946
02:10:50,695 --> 02:10:53,862
Welcome, Diane.

947
02:10:58,529 --> 02:11:00,571
Well..

948
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:04,404
Here's to love..

949
02:11:12,529 --> 02:11:15,320
Here's to love..

950
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:22,611
Ah, here she is..

951
02:11:30,653 --> 02:11:34,195
I don't believe you met my mother..

952
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,571
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

953
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:39,362
Just call me Coco, everybody does..

954
02:11:39,611 --> 02:11:41,737
- Pleased to meet you..
- Let's eat..

955
02:11:41,987 --> 02:11:45,112
I'm starving..

956
02:11:50,279 --> 02:11:53,903
I'm sorry, I was late.

957
02:12:12,737 --> 02:12:15,778
I'm from Deep River, Ontario..

958
02:12:16,029 --> 02:12:17,778
a small town.

959
02:12:18,029 --> 02:12:22,404
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

960
02:12:22,653 --> 02:12:26,112
I've always wanted to come here.

961
02:12:26,321 --> 02:12:29,778
I won this jitterbug contest..

962
02:12:30,029 --> 02:12:33,404
that sort of led to acting..

963
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:37,737
you know, wanting to act.

964
02:12:37,903 --> 02:12:41,362
When my aunt died..

965
02:12:41,611 --> 02:12:46,070
anyway, she left me so money..
she worked here..

966
02:12:46,321 --> 02:12:48,903
In the movies?

967
02:12:49,154 --> 02:12:51,487
Yes.

968
02:12:51,737 --> 02:12:55,737
How did you meet Camilla?

969
02:12:55,987 --> 02:12:58,070
On a "Sylvia North Story".

970
02:12:58,321 --> 02:13:01,737
Camilla was great in that.

971
02:13:15,487 --> 02:13:19,570
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

972
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:23,820
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

973
02:13:25,737 --> 02:13:28,112
The director..

974
02:13:28,362 --> 02:13:30,446
Bob Brooker?

975
02:13:30,695 --> 02:13:33,570
Yes.

976
02:13:34,862 --> 02:13:38,321
He didn't think so much of me..

977
02:13:41,987 --> 02:13:45,820
anyway, that's when we became friends.

978
02:13:46,070 --> 02:13:47,820
She helped me..

979
02:13:48,070 --> 02:13:53,112
getting some parts
in some of her films.

980
02:13:53,904 --> 02:13:56,612
I see.

981
02:14:10,154 --> 02:14:12,737
So, I got the pool..

982
02:14:12,987 --> 02:14:16,528
and she got the pool-man.

983
02:14:17,196 --> 02:14:22,778
I couldn't believe it
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

984
02:14:28,154 --> 02:14:31,612
Sometimes good things happen.

985
02:15:24,154 --> 02:15:27,945
So, I guess we saved the best for last..

986
02:15:29,945 --> 02:15:31,196
Do you want to tell them?

987
02:15:31,445 --> 02:15:34,862
No, you to tell them.

988
02:15:37,612 --> 02:15:41,029
Camilla and I..

989
02:15:52,154 --> 02:15:55,570
are going to be..

990
02:16:05,987 --> 02:16:09,070
Sorry about that.

991
02:16:16,154 --> 02:16:19,237
No, I'm fine.

992
02:16:23,820 --> 02:16:27,403
This is the girl.

993
02:16:27,653 --> 02:16:30,987
Don't show me this photothing here.

994
02:16:31,237 --> 02:16:35,695
It's just an actress'
photo, everybody's got one.

995
02:16:35,945 --> 02:16:38,403
You got the money?

996
02:16:38,653 --> 02:16:41,779
Sure do.

997
02:16:51,779 --> 02:16:57,403
Ok, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

998
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:03,112
Are you sure you want this?

999
02:17:06,528 --> 02:17:10,154
More than anything in this world.

1000
02:17:19,987 --> 02:17:23,487
When it's finished, you'll
find this where I told you.

1001
02:17:37,196 --> 02:17:40,528
What's it open?

1002
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,600
Silencio

1003
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:22,200
