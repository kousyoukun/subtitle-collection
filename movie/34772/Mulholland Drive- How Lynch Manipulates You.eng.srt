1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,799
like artists filmmakers have a unique

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,949
set of tools at their disposal cameras

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,230
lenses lights microphones music and they

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,198
use these tools to tell their story or

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,240
set a scene the director David Lynch has

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,000
of course the same tools as everybody

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,549
else but Lynch manipulates more than

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,740
just these physical instruments more

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,710
depth Lee and more strangely than any

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:30,989
other director I know of he uses

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,820
expectation as a tool he wields

12
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,679
expectation the expectation that comes

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,380
from what we know about film about its

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,808
history the history of stories and from

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,870
our humanity with the same nuance and

16
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:45,209
power as someone else might use light to

17
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:46,738
create a variety of moods in a space

18
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,200
today I want to look at how Lynch

19
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:50,640
manipulates our expectations in a single

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,770
scene from his masterpiece

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,289
al Holland drive the guide us towards

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,940
some interesting emotional territory the

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,460
scene I'm talking about is one of my

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,649
favorite ever the audition scene where

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,570
Betty played by Naomi Watts tries out

26
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,760
for a part in a small movie we later

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,978
learn is called the Sylvia North story

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,049
the scene occurs about halfway through

29
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:12,329
the film Betty has come to Hollywood

30
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,040
bright eyed and bushy tailed to be a

31
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:16,319
movie star of course I'd rather be known

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,759
as a great actress than a movie star but

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,559
you know sometimes people end up being

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,900
both she's staying at her aunt's house

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,969
where she discovers Rita a woman who's

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,590
been in a car accident and has lost all

37
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,000
her memory her expectations for the

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,650
audition have already been set up by

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,750
much of what we've witnessed leading up

40
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,969
to the scene Betty doesn't seem to be a

41
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,670
character with much internal depth or

42
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,530
darkness her flatness of effect is even

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,420
parodied in her very first scene at the

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,859
airport where the dialogue is clearly

45
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,349
overdubbed and fake okay Irene

46
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:47,450
won't that be the day her blind kindness

47
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:49,849
makes her vulnerable to exploitation she

48
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,879
doesn't even really care that a stranger

49
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,349
is living in her aunt's house so coming

50
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,329
into the audition we're feeling a couple

51
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,519
things were somewhat invested in Benny

52
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,849
success a basic expectation for any

53
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,500
protagonist but were wary of some danger

54
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:05,469
that may be in store because of her

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,060
innocence and we have little or no

56
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,969
expectation that she will impress with

57
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,729
her acting chops daddy why don't you

58
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:15,620
join woody over there and we'll play the

59
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,840
scene and of course the last thing to

60
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,450
mention is that we've already seen the

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,700
scene played out once before back at the

62
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:25,609
house practice round a tryout for a

63
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:28,459
tryout with Betty and Rita you're still

64
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,710
here I came back I thought that's what

65
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,510
you wanted nobody wants you here in this

66
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,760
first reading the scene is revealed to

67
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:35,419
be trite the dialogue cliched and

68
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,519
melodramatic

69
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,799
Betty's character rebukes her father's

70
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
friend who is trying to seduce her for

71
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,490
the second time it seems and she moves

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
closer and closer as her threats become

73
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,030
more Stern the two women can't even

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,530
finish without laughing at the soap

75
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,650
opera quality of the script then I cry

76
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,979
cry cry and then I say with big emotion

77
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,050
I hate true I hate it oh so a universe

78
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:01,639
of expectation has been laid out for the

79
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,189
viewer we'll see in a second how those

80
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,389
expectations will work as a trap but at

81
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,400
the start everything in the audition

82
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,649
room seems to reinforce what we already

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,989
think the people are about as stiff as

84
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,849
the gaudy wood paneling Betty's reading

85
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,830
partner woody looks like a star of all

86
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,539
my children who spent a little too much

87
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,510
time in the Sun the director is

88
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:23,030
absent-minded and laughable so when the

89
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:26,569
scene begins and woody Corral's Betty

90
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,969
into his slimy grasp what triggers first

91
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:31,189
is our awareness of how vulnerable she

92
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:34,430
is and when she pushes him away we don't

93
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:37,400
know if she's reacting as herself or as

94
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,099
the character was then woody moves to

95
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,390
put his hands below her waist and

96
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:44,209
something incredible happens a

97
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,879
transformation so sudden that the viewer

98
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,680
experiences whiplash as the critic

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,259
George Tolls notes were lured into

100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,210
engaging emotionally with the scene when

101
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:55,699
Lynch triggers our expectation that

102
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,939
Betty might be exploited we've dropped

103
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,649
our guard

104
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:00,180
but it's already too much we've

105
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,819
surrendered enough so that when Lynch

106
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,140
switches the bait we're left in awe at

107
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:09,379
what happens next

108
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,379
know what I want it's not that difficult

109
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:25,579
before I call my dad

110
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,579
he trusts you here is best

111
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:31,560
all throughout the film from the overdub

112
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:34,408
dialogue on down David Lynch has made us

113
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,930
privy to the veneer of things it's all

114
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,829
curiously two-dimensional and that puts

115
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,259
us on our guard

116
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:42,538
since surfaces are what we get Lynch

117
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,520
encourages us to examine those surfaces

118
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:46,860
always remaining detached enough for a

119
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:48,779
disinterested critical view of what

120
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,819
we're seeing but as with everything that

121
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,848
Lynch does this two dimensionality this

122
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:56,639
flatness is also a deception I know you

123
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:58,649
said you would entertain suggestions and

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,639
that's all anybody here is asking you to

125
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:04,709
do what are you talking about while we

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,629
think were on our guard superior to the

127
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:10,019
cloying emotions of Hollywood wish

128
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,789
fulfillment Lynch relishes dropping the

129
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:14,609
bottom out showing us just how

130
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:16,560
unprepared and susceptible we are to

131
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,250
emotions that are of society

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,649
treasures or deeply fears in a scene

133
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,348
that mirrors the audition Betty and Rita

134
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,718
go to a place called Club Silencio

135
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:34,769
where a special show is under way the

136
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:37,560
host repeats again and again there is no

137
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:40,408
that everything you're hearing he says

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,620
is a tape-recording expectations for the

139
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:45,870
scene are made totally explicit then a

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,329
woman comes out then sings a truly

141
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,329
heartbreaking Spanish version of Roy

142
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:53,728
Orbison's crying Lynch pushes tight into

143
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:57,978
her face in an extreme close-up and the

144
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,978
film begins to taunt us

145
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:12,418
a mole

146
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:15,430
what's at stake here as in any movie is

147
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:18,399
belief can the director make you believe

148
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,468
the artifice being presented to you it's

149
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,378
why directors use expectations we

150
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:25,360
inculcated from other films when two

151
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:27,520
people lock eyes for the first time and

152
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,710
the camera pushes in that's love at

153
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,899
first sight this is one way to generate

154
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:34,718
belief the definition of expectation is

155
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:38,258
a strong belief that something will

156
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:41,139
happen but Lynch goes a step further in

157
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,750
one way he sets up an expectation then

158
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,908
lures you into believing the opposite so

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,399
when the rug is pulled out the audience

160
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:50,680
is left suspended caught out and

161
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,138
captured engaging fully with the

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,150
terrifying nothingness that they were

163
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,158
warned against when the film finally

164
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,989
takes its hard right turn revealing

165
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:01,269
Betty's true story of pain and

166
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,889
degradation we're confronted again with

167
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:04,990
the same feeling believing we're going

168
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,598
to get the key to the mystery but

169
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,610
instead are only sunk deeper into the

170
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:11,560
dream it's worth noting by the way that

171
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,060
this all comes from an expectation that

172
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,028
goes unfulfilled

173
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,528
but the audition scene plays the reverse

174
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:19,718
feeling and I think this is important

175
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:22,750
instead of pulling the rug out to reveal

176
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:24,848
and abyss we come in fully prepared and

177
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,750
analytical only to be dropped into a

178
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:30,250
space of raw and honest emotion even

179
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,620
though we know it's acted even though we

180
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,560
know this is a film were entranced

181
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,990
totally believing the moment not because

182
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,908
our expectations were fulfilled but

183
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,338
because they were subvert it in a way

184
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:44,978
that we didn't think was possible then I

185
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:48,569
cryed cryed cryed and then I say with

186
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:48,568
big emotion I hate true

187
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,839
not content with the dreams that

188
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,829
Hollywood has been feeding us and mass

189
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,560
for decades David Lynch uses cliched

190
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,560
expectation to move us into the spaces

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:18,009
film has yet to go showing us the

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,790
dangers and the hopes of belief I can't

193
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,789
believe it

194
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:30,740
