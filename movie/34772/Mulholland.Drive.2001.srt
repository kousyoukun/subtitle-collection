8
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,729
你在干吗?我们不该在这停呀!

9
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,657
下车

10
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,616
那些家伙在车后找到的

11
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,090
你给我看过

12
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:04,995
- 可能和案子没关系
- 可能吧

13
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:09,395
死者中有戴珍珠项链的吗?

14
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,164
没有

15
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,435
可能是其他人落下的

16
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,775
我也是这么想

17
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:59,106
就剩一个包了

18
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,659
维奇斯餐馆(日落大道)

19
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,871
我只想来这

20
00:11:46,975 --> 00:11:49,339
来维奇斯餐馆?

21
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,642
只是这间

22
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:57,341
为什么偏认准这间?

23
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,152
有点难以启齿

24
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,989
说吧

25
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,125
我做了个与此地有关的梦

26
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,785
是吗?

27
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,863
明白我的意思吗?

28
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,089
是的

29
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,327
你做了个与此地有关的梦

30
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:23,336
然后呢?

31
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:30,602
唔

32
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,837
我是第二次做这个梦了

33
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,846
两次都是一样的

34
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,843
梦的开始是我来到这儿

35
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:42,079
当时既不是白天也不是晚上

36
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,385
半黑半白的,明白吗?

37
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:51,257
除了这些灯光外,周围环境就象现在

38
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:55,256
我说不出来的害怕

39
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,969
你就站在那边

40
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:08,709
站在柜台旁

41
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:14,171
两次梦里都有你,
而且你都是一副受惊吓的样子

42
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:19,717
看到你吓成那样,我更害怕

43
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,723
然后我意识到是怎么回事了

44
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:31,261
有一个男人

45
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,125
在这个地方后面

46
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,494
就是被他吓的

47
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:43,731
我可以透过墙看见他

48
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:46,535
我可以看见他的脸

49
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:57,709
我希望永远不会在现实中看见那张脸

50
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,053
就是这样了

51
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,860
所以…

52
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:14,832
你想来这看看这人是否存在

53
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,397
为了消除这种恐惧感

54
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,810
好的

55
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,751
他就在这附近

56
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:27,577
丹,你没事吧

57
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:31,049
丹

58
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,639
喂

59
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:02,145
那女孩还没找到

60
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:23,896
说吧

61
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,898
没什么变化

62
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,033
真不敢相信

63
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:39,785
该说再见了,贝蒂

64
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,797
旅途中有你做伴真不错

65
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,993
谢谢,我好兴奋好紧张

66
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,002
和你聊天真的很开心

67
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,470
记住,我要在大荧幕上看到你

68
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:53,133
好的,会有那么一天吗

69
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:56,370
祝你好运,亲爱的贝蒂

70
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:59,208
保重

71
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:03,011
我会的,谢谢你,亲爱的

72
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,709
贝蒂,很高兴见到你

73
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,151
- 祝你好运
- 谢谢

74
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,916
- 祝你好运
- 谢谢

75
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,081
- 再见
- 再见

76
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,662
我的包呢?

77
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,231
要去哪

78
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,533
哈文赫特1612号

79
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,338
知道

80
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,340
我打赌你就是贝蒂

81
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:50,070
是的

82
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,077
你是莲露莉斯夫人吧?

83
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,442
是的,宝贝

84
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,949
- 很高兴见到你
- 叫我可可就行了

85
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:00,952
其他人都这么叫我,
在这等等,我要去拿钥匙

86
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,918
好的,可可

87
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,686
维金斯

88
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,730
如果那该死的狗再在大院里拉屎的话

89
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:18,233
我就把它烤来做早餐

90
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:20,666
- 你没养宠物吧?
- 没有

91
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:24,171
虽然是合法的,但我真的不喜欢这儿有宠物

92
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,766
这儿曾经住过一个男人

93
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:29,537
他养了一只袋鼠

94
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:31,909
你想象不到…

95
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:35,915
那只袋鼠在这个院子里都做了些什么

96
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,043
一起去看看你姨妈的房子吧,挺不错的

97
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:41,085
我等不及了

98
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:49,993
真难以置信!

99
00:21:50,097 --> 00:21:54,031
我告诉过你

100
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:58,229
你姨妈事先应该交待清楚了,这是钥匙

101
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:01,031
- 需要什么尽管跟我说
- 好的

102
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:04,540
这儿的人和我关系融洽

103
00:22:04,643 --> 00:22:07,167
否则他们也不会住这儿了

104
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,576
如果你愿意,迟点会介绍你们认识

105
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:13,343
如果不愿意的话也别勉强

106
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,986
噢,对不起,露茜姨妈没说过这还有人

107
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:46,392
- 很对不起
- 没关系

108
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:48,658
我是露茜的侄女,我叫贝蒂

109
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,427
她应该说过我会来吧?

110
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,594
出了点意外,我才在这的

111
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,230
我明白,我看到衣服了

112
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:03,140
对不起,你没事吧?

113
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:05,145
发生什么事了?

114
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:09,007
一起车…

115
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:11,176
车祸

116
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,185
噢

117
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:15,254
你没事吧?

118
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:19,990
没事

119
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:22,492
我只是…

120
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:24,495
在洗澡

121
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:26,496
不好意思

122
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:29,829
你继续洗吧,我去整理行李

123
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,471
你叫什么名字?

124
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:44,441
不好意思,我还是出去吧,稍后再谈

125
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:24,741
我叫…丽塔

126
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,010
嗨

127
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,982
你是我姨妈的同事吗?

128
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,179
- 不,我…
- 不好意思

129
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,849
是我多事了,我…

130
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,562
她那头红发真漂亮

131
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,690
她正在加拿大拍电影,叫我来这住

132
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,269
不过…估计你都知道的

133
00:25:50,673 --> 00:25:53,037
我一辈子也买不起这种地方

134
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:57,133
除非我能成为电影明星

135
00:25:57,246 --> 00:26:00,441
当然,我更愿意做个演技派,而不是靠脸蛋

136
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,811
不过有些人是两者兼备的

137
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:07,374
这就是我来这儿的目的

138
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:14,785
不好意思,我太兴奋了

139
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,361
我刚从多伦多的深河镇来

140
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:19,520
现在我终于来到这个…

141
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:22,156
梦一般的地方

142
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,460
能体会我的感受吗?

143
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:34,007
怎么啦,坐下吧

144
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:40,446
你哪里受伤了?

145
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,050
- 我们得叫个医生来
- 不要

146
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,676
- 可能挺严重的
- 不,我…

147
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,721
我想睡觉

148
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,018
如果是脑震荡,你不能睡觉的

149
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,821
我睡会就没事了

150
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,294
我只想躺下睡觉

151
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:59,710
亚当,我们想提些建议…

152
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,878
你说过愿意接受意见的

153
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,185
大家都希望你能这么做

154
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:11,385
你在说什么?

155
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:13,985
思路要开放一些

156
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,293
你在重新挑选女主角

157
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,299
因此我们…

158
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:23,530
我们希望你思路能开放一些

159
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:36,113
上次的是什么?

160
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:41,550
好的,试试下一位

161
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:44,086
他不会喜欢的

162
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,351
走着瞧吧

163
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,920
嗨,卡氏兄弟

164
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,964
我给你们引见一下

165
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:01,868
请坐吧

166
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,132
这是达比先生,你知道的

167
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:07,800
这是导演亚当.克什尔

168
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,105
经理人罗伯特.斯密斯

169
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,175
她很漂亮

170
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,214
先生们,想喝点什么吗?

171
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:58,012
- 蒸馏咖啡
- 什么都不要

172
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,451
这相是拿来做什么的

173
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,113
一杯蒸馏咖啡

174
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,487
就这些

175
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:07,787
相信这次的咖啡你会满意的

176
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:11,524
我之前做过一些调查,知道你很挑剔

177
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,191
这咖啡重点推荐给你试试

178
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,360
这相是拿来做什么的?

179
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:18,597
推荐给你啊

180
00:30:19,705 --> 00:30:22,433
向你推荐的,亚当

181
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:27,038
这不是推荐,就要这个女孩

182
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:31,604
什么女孩,为什么?
这是怎么一回事,雷恩?

183
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:35,275
我们很乐意把她列为候选

184
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,443
你应该知道

185
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:40,817
许多人对这个角色有兴趣

186
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:44,154
兴趣?不!

187
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,159
有六名顶尖的女演员争夺这个角色

188
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:48,626
就要这个女孩子

189
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:51,756
- 瑞恩,这事你来处理
- 别急,别急,亚当

190
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,765
别急

191
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,268
没门,没门

192
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:14,313
餐巾

193
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:17,752
- 对不起?
- 餐巾

194
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:20,449
好的

195
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,457
失陪

196
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,106
还需要什么吗?

197
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,117
- 狗屎
- 对不起

198
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,390
- 这可是别人重点推荐的
- 这是公认最好的蒸馏咖啡之一

199
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:48,126
发生什么事了?
这个女孩是不可能演我的电影

200
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:51,667
帮帮我

201
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:53,397
就要这个女孩

202
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:56,905
这个女孩不能演我的电影

203
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:02,177
这电影已经不是你的了

204
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,116
就要这个女孩

205
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,018
卡氏兄弟上了那辆轿车没有?

206
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,952
- 是那两个穿黑西服的人吗?
- 是的

207
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,616
把车门开着

208
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,101
卡氏兄弟

209
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:11,026
- 打呀,老友
- 好的

210
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:57,035
下午好,罗科先生

211
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:03,777
她的名字叫卡米拉.罗丝

212
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:06,909
导演不想要她

213
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:12,825
你想换掉他吗?

214
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:17,194
我知道他们说…

215
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:21,766
然后

216
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:24,358
然后

217
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,368
那意味着我们应该

218
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,138
什么

219
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:34,937
停止一切事情

220
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,876
就是…

221
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:43,083
停止一切事情

222
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:51,292
那么我们会停止一切事情的

223
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,209
哥们

224
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,287
真是闻所未闻

225
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:27,446
真是出人意料

226
00:36:29,827 --> 00:36:31,816
这不是真的吧?

227
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,556
该死

228
00:36:34,664 --> 00:36:36,722
难以置信

229
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:45,772
兄弟,瞧着挺风光的

230
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,806
你一直在做什么?

231
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,241
也就是给那家伙做点事

232
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:53,369
是吗?日子还过得去吗?

233
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,540
挺艰苦的

234
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:59,742
我知道的

235
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:01,751
看看我呆的地方

236
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:04,549
这世道真不好混,兄弟

237
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,225
没那么惨的

238
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:12,562
希望你别惹什么麻烦

239
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,664
也就是那件事而已

240
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,664
你就是笑那事吧?

241
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:20,167
- 那故事可真逗
- 该死的车祸

242
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,937
嘿,那是…就是它了

243
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,340
那是埃德著名的黑名册

244
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:36,315
以电话号码书写的世界历史

245
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:23,449
我被什么东西咬了一口

246
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,041
不要

247
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:55,551
不要,不要

248
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,888
天哪

249
00:39:15,505 --> 00:39:19,165
她受了重伤,可以过来打个电话吗?
来帮个忙

250
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,673
她受了重伤,我是说真的

251
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,743
过来给医院打个电话

252
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:26,869
过来,我是说真的

253
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,504
我一个人应付不过来

254
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,378
不,放开我

255
00:39:32,485 --> 00:39:36,078
不,不

256
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,697
嘿,哥们

257
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:53,954
好的,姨妈,我会尽力的

258
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:59,218
那几行字我会记得滚瓜烂熟的

259
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:02,386
要么就在这张豪华皮沙发上

260
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:04,395
要么我会在后院边喝咖啡边记…

261
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:07,261
电影明星通常都这样

262
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:09,869
在这见到你的朋友丽塔,真让我大吃一惊

263
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,267
我进门时她正在洗澡

264
00:41:13,373 --> 00:41:15,737
丽塔

265
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:18,536
什么意思?

266
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,805
她碰到了车祸

267
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,573
丽塔,你的朋友

268
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:28,547
不是的,可可开的门

269
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,551
没有,可可没见到她

270
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,220
她正在睡觉

271
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,288
我相信这事可以搞清楚的

272
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,624
我们不必这么做的

273
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:47,099
别担心,姨妈,没必要报警的

274
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:01,879
你醒了

275
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:08,349
我刚才搞错了

276
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:11,979
本来以为你跟我姨妈认识

277
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:15,684
我刚和姨妈通过电话,她想让我报警

278
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:24,162
丽塔

279
00:42:27,471 --> 00:42:29,938
很抱歉,我…

280
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,938
怎么了,丽塔

281
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:37,937
我以为睡一觉醒来…

282
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:40,514
我以为睡一觉就没事了

283
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,478
怎么了?

284
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:47,651
我不知道自己是谁

285
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:49,846
你是什么意思?你叫丽塔呀

286
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:54,220
不,我不是,我不知道自己的名字

287
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,227
我不知道自己是谁

288
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:08,903
这是你的挂包

289
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:11,439
里面也许能找到你的名字

290
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:15,675
你也想知道的,对吗?

291
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,941
是的,但…打开它吧

292
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:57,863
- 什么都不想要?
- 不在这儿,不,谢谢

293
00:44:57,968 --> 00:45:02,494
- 喝点什么?
- 不,谢谢

294
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:05,264
有烟的话给我一根

295
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,802
我衬衣口袋里有

296
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:17,943
最近街上有没有新的女孩?

297
00:45:20,454 --> 00:45:22,352
没有

298
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:24,354
没见过

299
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,992
黑头发的白人女孩?

300
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:29,992
可能有点蓬头垢面

301
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,027
没有

302
00:45:36,668 --> 00:45:39,135
好好的帮我看着点,宝贝

303
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:42,500
- 没问题
- 你保证过的

304
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,441
这些钱…

305
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,244
你不知道是怎么来的吗?

306
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,076
不知道

307
00:45:55,184 --> 00:45:59,448
你看到这些东西,这些钱和钥匙…

308
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:04,322
能不能让你想起点什么来?

309
00:46:06,294 --> 00:46:08,761
有一些…

310
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,990
一些…那儿

311
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:28,433
- 你说什么?
- 他们把所有人都炒了

312
00:46:29,347 --> 00:46:31,540
谁把所有人都炒了?

313
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,880
是瑞恩,等等,我正在打电话

314
00:46:35,986 --> 00:46:39,044
他们关闭了拍摄场,大家都走了

315
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:42,156
你最好来一下

316
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,654
不

317
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:46,660
你得跟瑞恩谈谈,这事你得搞定

318
00:46:46,796 --> 00:46:49,662
- 我正要回家
- 回家?

319
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:51,687
在办公室碰面,我们得有所动作

320
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:53,700
你得做点什么

321
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:56,091
我要回家,辛西娅

322
00:46:56,203 --> 00:46:58,192
亚当,听我说,这不象你的风格

323
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,705
拜托你到办公室来

324
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:02,569
- 我们肯定能做些什么的
- 我要回家

325
00:47:13,686 --> 00:47:15,914
我在想你要去哪

326
00:47:20,858 --> 00:47:22,984
穆赫兰道

327
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:29,862
穆赫兰道

328
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:34,295
那就是我要去的地方…

329
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:37,461
穆赫兰道

330
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:41,198
也许车祸就发生在那

331
00:47:42,578 --> 00:47:45,875
警察局一定会有记录的
我们打个电话问问

332
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,106
- 不行
- 我们可以到外面用公用电话

333
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:51,477
只是确定一下是否出过车祸

334
00:47:51,585 --> 00:47:54,017
来吧,就象电影里的桥段

335
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,588
我们也象电影里的角色一样

336
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:00,380
反正我也想出去走走

337
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:03,858
身在好莱坞,却没好好看过它呢

338
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:06,863
来吧,丽塔,你很累吗?

339
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:16,069
好的

340
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:18,367
但,只是…

341
00:48:20,477 --> 00:48:22,909
只是去搞清楚

342
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:27,140
只是去搞清楚…

343
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:29,681
在穆赫兰道是否出过车祸

344
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,219
洛兰尼

345
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,257
洛兰尼,你在家吗

346
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:22,559
洛兰尼

347
00:49:41,747 --> 00:49:44,543
现在你都看到了

348
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:48,142
忘了吧

349
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:50,151
这样比较明智

350
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:55,915
你到底想干什么?

351
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:10,463
你干什么?

352
00:50:13,442 --> 00:50:15,840
那是我的珠宝

353
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:35,556
你这杂种

354
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:37,786
他很郁闷,洛兰尼

355
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:46,324
你干什么?

356
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:51,166
住手,住手

357
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:53,435
亚当,住手

358
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:56,807
住手,住手

359
00:50:56,912 --> 00:51:01,279
亚当,住手

360
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:04,647
你弄痛我了,杰里

361
00:51:04,753 --> 00:51:07,619
你弄痛我了

362
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,657
别这么对你老婆,伙计
我就不在乎我老婆怎么做

363
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:16,887
把他扔出去

364
00:51:16,997 --> 00:51:19,123
把他扔出去

365
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:21,130
去你的,亚当

366
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:23,495
把他扔出去

367
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:32,299
滚

368
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,542
我们先把它藏起来

369
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,782
那有一个

370
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:19,198
好莱坞警察局

371
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:22,292
我想询问一下
昨晚在穆赫兰道上发生的车祸

372
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:24,769
请稍等,我帮你转到交通科

373
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:30,274
- 我是白斯特警官
- 我想问一下…

374
00:53:32,014 --> 00:53:35,674
昨晚我听到了点声音,好象是撞车

375
00:53:35,784 --> 00:53:39,775
穆赫兰道上是否发生了车祸?

376
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,785
是的,是发生了车祸

377
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,913
- 能告诉我出了什么事吗?
- 不行

378
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,753
- 有人受伤吗?
- 能把名字告诉我吗?

379
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:56,927
是有一起车祸

380
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:59,969
他不肯多说,应该就是你遇到的那起

381
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,503
我知道是的

382
00:54:02,608 --> 00:54:05,166
或许报纸上会有相关的报道

383
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,468
来吧,我们一边喝咖啡,一边看报纸去

384
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:15,012
可能发生得太晚了,今天的报纸没有报道

385
00:54:15,117 --> 00:54:17,015
什么都没有吗?

386
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:21,349
我没找到

387
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:24,288
没关系的

388
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:29,894
谢谢

389
00:54:31,331 --> 00:54:33,194
戴安妮

390
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:41,495
就这些了吗?可以下单了吗?

391
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:43,403
丽塔,还要点什么吗?

392
00:54:46,379 --> 00:54:49,346
不,咖啡就行了

393
00:54:49,448 --> 00:54:51,846
- 可以下单了
- 好的

394
00:54:57,153 --> 00:55:01,349
怎么了?丽塔

395
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:10,496
我想起点东西

396
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,827
我想起点东西

397
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,205
- 想起什么了?
- 戴安妮.西恩

398
00:55:19,308 --> 00:55:21,740
我好象就叫这名字

399
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:31,105
D.西恩,只有一个

400
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:33,115
打个电话过去

401
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:42,754
给自己打电话很奇怪

402
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,486
不一定是我

403
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,160
你好,是我,请留言

404
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:02,139
那不是我的声音

405
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:05,143
但我认识她

406
00:56:07,149 --> 00:56:10,605
可能这不是戴安妮.西恩的声音

407
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:12,912
可能是你的室友

408
00:56:13,053 --> 00:56:18,682
如果她是戴安妮的话,应该知道你是谁

409
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:21,155
也许吧

410
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,022
也许,也许

411
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,286
亚当.克什尔

412
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:04,761
- 亚当.克什尔
- 走开

413
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:08,230
- 这是亚当.克什尔的房子
- 见鬼给我滚出去

414
00:57:08,335 --> 00:57:11,063
滚出去

415
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:13,501
亚当.克什尔

416
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:22,273
滚开,他再也不会回来的了

417
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,243
杂种

418
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:27,441
估计你听不懂英语吧!她叫你离开

419
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,451
- 门在那
- 杰里

420
00:57:30,554 --> 00:57:33,146
滚开,杰里,滚开

421
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:40,291
亚当.克什尔

422
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:05,944
- 什么事?科基
- 很抱歉,克什尔先生

423
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:10,008
你的信用卡似乎有点问题

424
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,849
什么?我给你现金吧,科基

425
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:18,950
银行的两个家伙来过这

426
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,960
银行?

427
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,058
- 他们怎么知道我在这
- 我不知道

428
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,100
他们说了些什么?

429
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:32,638
他们说你的帐户已经没钱了

430
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:36,006
你的信用卡被取消了

431
00:58:37,746 --> 00:58:41,305
真难以置信

432
00:58:44,785 --> 00:58:47,081
我…我不知道发生了什么事

433
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:51,452
一群胡说八道的家伙

434
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:55,284
我有大把现金,科基

435
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:59,692
我知道,不要担心

436
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,561
不过,听着,我很抱歉

437
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:06,067
我有义务提醒你

438
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,329
小心点

439
00:59:08,572 --> 00:59:12,734
不管你躲在哪,他们都能找到你

440
00:59:14,577 --> 00:59:16,475
好的

441
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:19,477
我很抱歉

442
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:44,158
喂

443
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,202
有人冻结了我的银行帐户

444
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:48,203
我已经知道了,你在哪?亚当

445
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:50,500
抱歉搞不懂你什么意思,你已经知道了?

446
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:52,597
有人打电话找过你

447
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:54,872
他们告诉我,你已破产了

448
00:59:54,979 --> 00:59:57,172
我不信,因此我打了几个电话

449
00:59:57,281 --> 00:59:59,213
- 然后呢?
- 你确实破产了

450
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:01,215
我没破产

451
01:00:01,352 --> 01:00:04,046
但你确实破产了,你在哪?

452
01:00:05,722 --> 01:00:08,246
我在市区,科基这儿

453
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:12,051
你认识一个叫“牛仔”的人吗?

454
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:15,356
- 牛仔?
- 是的

455
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:20,195
牛仔,这个人想见你

456
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:22,631
杰森觉得应该去见他

457
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:27,633
杰森认为我该去见牛仔吗?

458
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:31,005
我是不是要带上
高顶宽边呢帽和左轮手枪?

459
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:34,671
听着,某些迹象表明
他与所发生的事有联系

460
01:00:34,814 --> 01:00:36,780
亚当,你应该去见他

461
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:39,715
马上去

462
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:41,716
出了什么事?辛西娅

463
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,183
真是怪异的一天

464
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:47,988
而且越来越奇怪

465
01:00:50,394 --> 01:00:53,623
好吧,我到哪和这位牛仔碰头?
要不要我骑着马去?

466
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,754
你真搞笑

467
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:58,832
如果要找他的话

468
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:01,697
去到比奇伍德峡谷的顶上

469
01:01:01,804 --> 01:01:05,761
那里有个围栏,他在那等你

470
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,273
你在戏弄我?

471
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,900
你去不去?

472
01:01:11,045 --> 01:01:13,375
当然去

473
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,606
今天真不是什么吉日,什么时候?

474
01:01:16,717 --> 01:01:18,775
我马上致电他

475
01:01:18,886 --> 01:01:21,512
然后再通知你

476
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:25,679
如果你愿意,可以来我这里

477
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:28,918
不,辛妮娅,我觉得不妥

478
01:01:29,027 --> 01:01:31,255
只是让你落落脚而已

479
01:01:31,363 --> 01:01:34,489
非常感激,我自己会找地方的

480
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:37,963
快去给牛仔打电话,然后答复我

481
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,969
好,我怕你什么地方可能会疏忽

482
01:01:41,104 --> 01:01:45,095
别管了,小亲亲,我等你电话

483
01:01:57,052 --> 01:01:59,450
大概就在这附近了,塞丽亚泊尼塔

484
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,452
不是很远

485
01:02:02,623 --> 01:02:04,521
有什么问题吗?

486
01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:07,590
我不能肯定是这儿

487
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:11,624
我知道你有点害怕

488
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:15,158
我保证一定小心行事

489
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:22,502
等明天我们去了,就知道是不是那了

490
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:38,719
没事的

491
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:42,118
可能是可可

492
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:48,389
什么事?需要帮忙吗?

493
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:50,656
有人要倒霉了

494
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:55,362
你是谁?

495
01:02:55,469 --> 01:02:58,265
你在露茜的家里做什么?

496
01:02:58,372 --> 01:03:00,430
她让我呆在这的

497
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:03,098
我是她的侄女,我叫贝蒂

498
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:05,107
不,不是的

499
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,574
她不是这样说的

500
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:12,341
有人倒霉了,大事不好了

501
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,884
抱歉我不认识你,而且…

502
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:18,921
露易斯,你在干什么?露易斯

503
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:21,148
可可

504
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:24,782
我下午3点一直在找你

505
01:03:24,928 --> 01:03:28,487
那人在我房间,她不肯走

506
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:31,565
我要你赶她走,马上赶她走

507
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,964
这位是露易斯.波尼尔,她没有恶意的

508
01:03:35,069 --> 01:03:39,127
露易斯,这位是贝蒂,露茜的侄女

509
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,264
正好我要来看贝蒂

510
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:48,437
贝蒂是演电影的,
我来给她送明天试镜台词

511
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:51,277
- 给你,甜心
- 谢谢

512
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:53,942
走吧,露易斯,我带你回家

513
01:03:54,086 --> 01:03:56,382
- 我很抱歉,这种事时有发生
- 没关系

514
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:58,750
- 快点
- 不,她说了有人要倒霉

515
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,448
住口,我带你回家

516
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:04,792
快点,我…

517
01:04:04,896 --> 01:04:07,624
- 晚安,贝蒂
- 晚安

518
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:09,630
晚安

519
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:49,829
牛仔

520
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:01,354
- 您好
- 您好

521
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:08,158
- 很美的夜晚
- 是的

522
01:06:09,805 --> 01:06:15,537
麻烦你从旅馆大老远跑来见我

523
01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:20,170
不要紧,你想怎么样?

524
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:24,736
来了个直肠直肚的人

525
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:27,613
很好奇,对吗?

526
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,618
随你怎么说吧

527
01:06:31,123 --> 01:06:33,681
一个人的态度

528
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:39,454
态度决定人生

529
01:06:39,564 --> 01:06:42,054
你同意吗?

530
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:43,826
当然

531
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:48,595
你是为了讨我欢心,而言不由衷…

532
01:06:48,706 --> 01:06:54,870
还是确实这么认为的?

533
01:06:56,211 --> 01:07:00,202
真心同意您的观点

534
01:07:02,017 --> 01:07:03,915
我的什么观点?

535
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:10,448
态度很大程度上决定人生

536
01:07:12,124 --> 01:07:14,682
根据我的观点

537
01:07:14,828 --> 01:07:19,763
你一定是个不在乎自己过的好不好的人

538
01:07:19,897 --> 01:07:22,057
怎么讲?

539
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:27,693
停下来反省一下吧

540
01:07:27,806 --> 01:07:29,999
拜托你这么做吧

541
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:35,433
好的,我正在反省

542
01:07:38,914 --> 01:07:40,880
你根本没在反省

543
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:43,951
你真的太自以为是了

544
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:49,152
现在,我希望你反省,不要再自以为是了

545
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:51,188
拜托你尝试一下

546
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:56,192
到底怎么回事?你到底要我怎么做?

547
01:07:56,297 --> 01:07:59,561
假定有一辆双座车

548
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:02,029
一辆双座车需要几个司机?

549
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:04,194
一个

550
01:08:04,303 --> 01:08:08,237
假设我已经是那个唯一的司机了

551
01:08:08,341 --> 01:08:11,536
如果你态度端正的话
你可以一起乘我的车

552
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:14,740
好的

553
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:17,746
我希望你明天回去上班

554
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:21,304
无论如何女主角得重选…

555
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:25,546
你要让许多女孩为角色试镜

556
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:30,554
而当试到那个女孩时,你得说

557
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,957
就是她了

558
01:08:34,062 --> 01:08:39,224
其他角色人选仍然由你定

559
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:42,164
但女主角不由你定

560
01:08:44,271 --> 01:08:49,707
表现出色的话,你还能再见我一次

561
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:55,269
如果干的不好,你还会再见我两次

562
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:57,313
晚安

563
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:23,902
你还没走

564
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:26,802
我又回来了,这不正如你所愿吗?

565
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:28,807
没人想看见你

566
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:31,536
真的吗?

567
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,272
我父母就在楼上,他们以为你已经走了

568
01:09:34,415 --> 01:09:38,543
- 那又怎样?很吃惊罢了
- 我要叫他们下来,我要叫我父亲下来

569
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,778
你不会的

570
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:44,184
你威胁我是没有用的

571
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:46,255
你玩的游戏很危险

572
01:09:46,358 --> 01:09:48,688
你知道我想怎么样的,也不是很难满足的

573
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:52,284
出去,否则我把父亲叫下来

574
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:55,489
他很信任你,把你当最好的朋友

575
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,032
一切都将结束

576
01:09:58,135 --> 01:10:01,330
你呢?你父亲会怎么看你?

577
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:05,803
不要说了,你一开始就这样说

578
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:09,206
如果我把实情告诉他们
他们会把你送进监狱

579
01:10:09,312 --> 01:10:11,404
请马上离开这,免得我…

580
01:10:12,514 --> 01:10:14,412
免得你什么?

581
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:18,381
免得…我宰了你

582
01:10:18,487 --> 01:10:20,783
那他们会把你扔进监狱

583
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:27,892
然后我会哭,哭,哭,接着很动情地说

584
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:30,689
我恨你,我恨我们俩个

585
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,698
- 好蹩脚的剧本
- 不过你真的很棒

586
01:10:39,037 --> 01:10:41,265
[英国口音]谢谢你,亲爱的

587
01:10:56,153 --> 01:10:58,415
嘿,你是谁?

588
01:10:59,856 --> 01:11:01,719
贝蒂

589
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:14,018
贝蒂,能到外面聊几句吗?

590
01:11:27,808 --> 01:11:31,140
- 什么事?可可
- 你姨妈打电话给我

591
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,244
我就担心会这样

592
01:11:34,348 --> 01:11:36,713
她想弄清楚,到底是谁在她家里

593
01:11:38,253 --> 01:11:41,187
她不过呆一两个晚上就会走的

594
01:11:41,323 --> 01:11:46,761
我向姨妈解释过的,但当时飞机正在起飞,
电话线路不是很好,她可能有点误会

595
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:49,055
我说过这是我的朋友丽塔

596
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:51,564
可她说不认识什么丽塔

597
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:54,959
- 看着我,甜心
- 可可

598
01:11:55,071 --> 01:11:57,129
她人很好的

599
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,139
甜心,你是个好孩子

600
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:05,270
你的话听起来不错,我却总觉的不是很踏实

601
01:12:05,382 --> 01:12:07,872
不过,我相信你会处理好这事的

602
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:09,885
谢谢

603
01:12:09,987 --> 01:12:12,318
别让我失望

604
01:12:12,423 --> 01:12:14,686
露易斯.波尼尔说过这里要出事

605
01:12:14,826 --> 01:12:16,725
记得吗?就是昨晚

606
01:12:16,828 --> 01:12:20,319
她说的不一定对

607
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:24,196
但如果真有什么麻烦,就得马上解决掉

608
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,538
没事吧?

609
01:12:36,716 --> 01:12:38,512
我在这给你添麻烦了吧

610
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:41,849
没有,一切都挺好的

611
01:12:41,955 --> 01:12:44,115
我要去把三文治弄好

612
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:47,125
还有一个小时就要试镜了

613
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,113
两小时后应该能回来

614
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,278
- 别把可乐都喝光了
- 祝你好运

615
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,585
等我回来后会叫车在外面等着,
你做好出门准备

616
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,591
- 好吗?
- 好的

617
01:13:48,761 --> 01:13:50,990
贝蒂.艾姆斯

618
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:54,793
给你介绍一下,杰克.土特曼,我的助手

619
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:57,664
伍迪.卡特滋

620
01:13:57,804 --> 01:14:00,271
他会和你一起表演

621
01:14:01,943 --> 01:14:03,842
鲍勃.保波克,我们的导演

622
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,639
还有朱丽叶.卡文迪

623
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:09,214
以及让人惊喜的嘉宾

624
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:11,477
里尼.詹姆斯

625
01:14:11,586 --> 01:14:13,985
唉,我们请不起她演戏

626
01:14:14,089 --> 01:14:19,220
不过挑选演员,她也是最有眼光的

627
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:22,490
谢谢,沃里…你好,贝蒂

628
01:14:22,598 --> 01:14:24,462
幸会

629
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:26,760
这是我的助手,尼奇

630
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,768
噢

631
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:30,804
还有可爱的马莎

632
01:14:30,907 --> 01:14:33,238
马莎.约翰逊,以前你见过的

633
01:14:35,445 --> 01:14:37,378
你好

634
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:40,449
可以开始了吗?

635
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:45,617
要不要先来杯水或是咖啡?

636
01:14:45,723 --> 01:14:47,622
不要了

637
01:14:47,725 --> 01:14:51,160
好的,那么大家各就各位

638
01:14:53,265 --> 01:14:58,828
贝蒂,到伍迪那边去,准备开始了

639
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:06,502
鲍勃,有什么要交待贝蒂的?

640
01:15:06,646 --> 01:15:14,712
注意,两个人之间的不是争论

641
01:15:16,623 --> 01:15:23,357
所以不要试图去演,要自然一点

642
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:30,662
好的

643
01:15:30,772 --> 01:15:34,332
- 告诉我哪受伤了,宝贝
- 什么?

644
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:36,601
嘿,波比,我看应该演得亲热点

645
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,575
就像和其他女孩试镜一样

646
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,375
她叫什么名字来着?
黑头发的那个,感觉挺好的

647
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,382
- 你认为怎么样?
- 很好,伍迪

648
01:15:43,486 --> 01:15:45,749
说那句台词别太快了

649
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:49,380
你说的是那句台词吧?“免得什么?”
告诉你吧

650
01:15:50,492 --> 01:15:53,187
波比,演戏其实是相互影响的

651
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:56,696
我只是配合而已,她们都说的很快

652
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,699
“他们会逮捕你的”象这么快

653
01:15:58,802 --> 01:16:01,065
或者“他们要把你扔进监狱”
她们说的都很快

654
01:16:01,172 --> 01:16:03,332
她们说的很快,我也自然说得快

655
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,670
- 你叫什么名字?
- 贝蒂

656
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:10,338
听着,你说台词如果能慢一点
我也会慢一点的,好吗?

657
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:13,381
我们亲热一点

658
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:16,351
就像是在电影里,好吗?

659
01:16:18,891 --> 01:16:20,858
父亲最好的朋友上班去了

660
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:24,519
鲍勃?

661
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:29,833
开始

662
01:16:34,942 --> 01:16:36,841
你还没走

663
01:16:38,378 --> 01:16:41,938
我回来了,这不正如你所愿吗?

664
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:45,244
- 没人想看见你
- 真的吗?

665
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:47,979
我父母就在楼上

666
01:16:48,123 --> 01:16:50,022
他们以为你已经走了

667
01:16:50,124 --> 01:16:52,057
那又怎样?很惊讶吧

668
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,492
我要叫他们下来,我要叫我父亲下来

669
01:16:55,598 --> 01:16:57,497
你不会的

670
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:15,707
你会玩死自己的

671
01:17:17,521 --> 01:17:22,515
你恐吓我是没有用的

672
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:28,932
你知道我想怎么样的
也不是很难满足的

673
01:17:32,003 --> 01:17:39,033
出去,要不我把父亲叫下来

674
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:45,776
他很信任你,把你当最好的朋友

675
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:51,988
一切都将结束

676
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:58,221
你呢?你父亲会怎么看你?

677
01:18:01,602 --> 01:18:06,972
别说了,你从一开始就这么说

678
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:13,212
如果我把实情告诉他们
他们会把你送进监狱

679
01:18:20,923 --> 01:18:25,053
请马上离开这,免得我…

680
01:18:28,264 --> 01:18:30,163
免得你什么?

681
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:53,117
免得…我宰了你

682
01:19:08,475 --> 01:19:10,408
那他们会把你扔进监狱

683
01:19:19,419 --> 01:19:21,283
我恨你

684
01:19:23,257 --> 01:19:25,156
我恨我们俩个

685
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:43,969
- 我要把她带到那边
- 演的很好

686
01:19:48,219 --> 01:19:50,118
就是这样了

687
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:53,484
对,就这样了,不错

688
01:19:53,591 --> 01:19:56,354
宝贝,你演戏挺有一套,真的

689
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,154
鲍勃?

690
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:02,931
真的很好

691
01:20:03,068 --> 01:20:05,627
略有点造作

692
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:09,729
不过,还是挺动情的

693
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,502
是的,非常好

694
01:20:12,612 --> 01:20:15,409
真的

695
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:24,314
谢谢,贝蒂

696
01:20:24,424 --> 01:20:26,983
我是真心的

697
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:29,994
我是说,太优秀了

698
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:32,997
你的姨妈会为你骄傲的

699
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,196
一有机会我就会告诉她

700
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:39,736
现在,你和我

701
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:41,740
很快又要谈谈了

702
01:20:44,212 --> 01:20:46,111
谢谢,布朗先生

703
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:49,513
你们肯定有不少话要谈
我们带贝蒂出去了

704
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:53,518
你能来是我们的荣幸,里尼

705
01:20:53,622 --> 01:20:56,112
别把自己当外人

706
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:59,159
- 我们很高兴你能来
- 走吧,贝蒂

707
01:20:59,262 --> 01:21:01,126
再次感谢,布朗先生

708
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:06,190
很高兴见到大家,再见

709
01:21:08,004 --> 01:21:10,528
再见

710
01:21:12,009 --> 01:21:14,909
她真是太棒了

711
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:16,911
你究竟是从哪发掘她的?

712
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:18,947
天哪,真的太烂了

713
01:21:20,718 --> 01:21:23,277
不是说你,贝蒂,你演技一流

714
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:27,347
但可怜的沃里,他永远演不好戏

715
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:29,722
他已经是20年前的人物了

716
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:32,922
伍迪.卡特滋做这些只是兴趣

717
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:35,089
至于演技,我听说非常烂

718
01:21:35,201 --> 01:21:37,225
是的,很烂

719
01:21:37,337 --> 01:21:39,600
沃里这个可怜的蠢老头

720
01:21:39,706 --> 01:21:43,642
他很好,他看起来很和蔼

721
01:21:43,743 --> 01:21:46,677
而且沃里…
布朗先生是我姨妈一位很亲密的朋友

722
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:49,714
冷静点,贝蒂,别误会了,我爱沃里

723
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:53,411
本应如此,我和他结婚10年了

724
01:21:53,521 --> 01:21:56,489
我喜欢演员,所有的演员

725
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:59,820
我们只是有点油罢了

726
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:04,592
我们给你介绍一位出类拔萃的导演

727
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,566
他那部电影很适合你

728
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:09,602
一炮而红

729
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:06,229
停,非常感谢,卡罗,我很快就回来

730
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:08,662
- 检查镜头
- 检查镜头

731
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:10,667
谢谢,我们会给你个结果的

732
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:13,967
非常感谢你的光临,我知道你很忙

733
01:24:14,073 --> 01:24:17,098
和我开玩笑?
我喜欢这个剧本,你告诉我在哪签字吧

734
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:21,837
我喜欢你,不过我要见完所有人选后再决定

735
01:24:21,948 --> 01:24:23,847
- 我会尽快通知你的
- 我知道你肯定会的

736
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,747
因为我的经纪人会日夜骚扰你

737
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:29,378
- 我也会
- 这是我的荣幸,离开这儿

738
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,422
你对我太冷谈了,别把我忘了

739
01:24:31,526 --> 01:24:34,323
- 我演定了这角色
- 再会

740
01:24:35,496 --> 01:24:37,929
汉克,汉克在哪

741
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:40,796
- 下一位是谁,汉克
- 是卡米拉.罗丝

742
01:24:42,404 --> 01:24:44,303
- 她准备好了吗?
- 都准备好了

743
01:24:45,741 --> 01:24:48,140
- 带她进来
- 下一位卡米拉.罗丝

744
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:59,285
西尔维亚诺兹故事
卡米拉.罗丝

745
01:24:59,389 --> 01:25:02,152
好了,开始了

746
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:04,692
请放音乐

747
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:06,728
开始

748
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:40,495
叫杰森来这

749
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:42,830
辛迪,亚当想见杰森

750
01:26:21,212 --> 01:26:24,977
你有事找我吗?亚当

751
01:26:35,927 --> 01:26:37,894
就是这个女孩了

752
01:26:43,035 --> 01:26:46,060
真有眼光,亚当

753
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,846
天啊

754
01:27:08,263 --> 01:27:10,492
我得走了

755
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:14,431
我约了朋友,对不起

756
01:27:14,536 --> 01:27:17,197
我得走了

757
01:27:41,865 --> 01:27:44,560
应该就在这附近了

758
01:27:44,669 --> 01:27:48,901
2-5-9-0,就是它了,在那边

759
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,439
- 眼熟吗?
- 不

760
01:27:57,116 --> 01:28:01,780
- 别停车
- 怎么了?你看到什么了?

761
01:28:01,887 --> 01:28:04,582
- 坐在那辆车前面的人
- 你认识他们吗?

762
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:07,749
- 不认识
- 继续开

763
01:28:07,861 --> 01:28:09,760
绕到他们后面去

764
01:28:59,016 --> 01:29:00,949
西恩,12号

765
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,609
你吓死我了

766
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,970
看到没?都说过没什么可怕的了

767
01:30:58,478 --> 01:31:00,877
贝蒂,等等

768
01:31:00,982 --> 01:31:03,381
别

769
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:31,178
没人在家

770
01:31:31,282 --> 01:31:33,010
什么事?

771
01:31:35,586 --> 01:31:37,485
戴安妮

772
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:41,555
她在17号

773
01:31:42,894 --> 01:31:44,793
但那上面写着是12号

774
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:50,662
我和她换了房子,她在17号

775
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:53,363
在左边的最尽头

776
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:00,673
不过她好几天没露面了

777
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,349
我们可以给她留个条

778
01:32:05,451 --> 01:32:07,350
我和你们一起去

779
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,985
我还有东西在她那里

780
01:32:17,564 --> 01:32:19,588
你们去吧,我要接个电话

781
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:37,748
估计你不是戴安妮.西恩

782
01:32:37,854 --> 01:32:39,753
我也不觉得是

783
01:33:16,762 --> 01:33:18,729
可能还是没人在家

784
01:33:48,230 --> 01:33:50,129
你在干什么?

785
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:53,065
来吧,帮我一把,来吧

786
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:56,262
- 我要把前门打开
- 别

787
01:34:02,212 --> 01:34:04,111
帮帮我

788
01:34:07,418 --> 01:34:10,147
帮帮我

789
01:36:31,474 --> 01:36:33,373
丽塔

790
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:37,544
我知道你在做什么

791
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,769
我知道你要做什么

792
01:37:03,942 --> 01:37:05,841
还是让我来吧

793
01:37:14,921 --> 01:37:16,820
让我来吧

794
01:37:40,483 --> 01:37:42,382
看着已经不象你了

795
01:38:04,275 --> 01:38:06,174
晚安,贝蒂

796
01:38:06,277 --> 01:38:09,109
在屋里你不需要戴的

797
01:38:09,213 --> 01:38:11,203
什么?

798
01:38:11,315 --> 01:38:13,009
假发

799
01:38:14,285 --> 01:38:17,549
只是想多看会现在的样子

800
01:38:17,656 --> 01:38:19,555
睡觉时我会脱下的

801
01:38:19,657 --> 01:38:24,253
- 别睡在沙发上了
- 没关系的

802
01:38:24,397 --> 01:38:27,422
不要紧的,这张床大的很

803
01:38:27,567 --> 01:38:29,534
来吧,上来睡个好觉吧

804
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:04,029
比睡沙发舒服多了,是吗?

805
01:39:04,173 --> 01:39:07,141
是的

806
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:15,815
谢谢你,贝蒂

807
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:19,547
别客气

808
01:39:19,656 --> 01:39:21,885
昨晚不该让你睡在沙发上的

809
01:39:21,992 --> 01:39:24,687
不,我是指

810
01:39:24,796 --> 01:39:27,628
谢谢你所做的一切

811
01:39:31,035 --> 01:39:32,934
你太客气了

812
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:45,048
晚安,亲爱的贝蒂

813
01:39:55,128 --> 01:39:57,027
晚安

814
01:40:39,009 --> 01:40:41,238
你以前这么做过吗?

815
01:40:43,314 --> 01:40:45,406
我不知道

816
01:40:45,517 --> 01:40:47,416
你呢?

817
01:41:00,933 --> 01:41:03,196
我想和你在一起

818
01:41:29,632 --> 01:41:31,792
我爱你

819
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,876
我爱你

820
01:42:15,949 --> 01:42:17,848
[西班牙语]寂静

01:42:58,962 --> 01:43:01,020
丽塔,醒醒

833
01:43:03,066 --> 01:43:07,196
- 不,不
- 没事的,没事的

834

不妥,不妥

01:43:09,306 --> 01:43:11,500
怎么?

836
01:43:12,776 --> 01:43:15,335
跟我到一个地方去

837
01:43:17,714 --> 01:43:21,650
现在是2点,凌晨2点

838
01:43:24,622 --> 01:43:26,555
跟我到一个地方去

839
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:31,551
可以,现在吗?

840
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,027
马上就去

841
01:45:09,237 --> 01:45:13,298
[西班牙语]没有乐队

842
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,705
没有乐队

843
01:45:16,812 --> 01:45:19,473
[西班牙语]这些全是录音

844
01:45:21,316 --> 01:45:24,011
这全是…

845
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:26,415
录音

846
01:45:26,522 --> 01:45:29,888
[西班牙语]寂静
然而

847
01:45:29,992 --> 01:45:31,891
我们可以听到乐声

848
01:45:33,563 --> 01:45:36,554
如果我们想听竖笛…

849
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:39,327
听着

850
01:45:44,742 --> 01:45:47,141
[西班牙语]请听长号声

851
01:45:52,817 --> 01:45:54,909
[西班牙语]请听喇叭

852
01:45:57,122 --> 01:46:02,059
[西班牙语]动人的喇叭声

853
01:46:06,531 --> 01:46:09,761
[法语]

854
01:46:09,869 --> 01:46:13,304
减弱的喇叭声

855
01:46:31,392 --> 01:46:33,916
这全是录音

856
01:46:36,864 --> 01:46:39,593
[西班牙语]没有乐队

857
01:46:41,169 --> 01:46:44,569
这全是…一盒录音带

858
01:46:54,617 --> 01:46:58,245
[西班牙语]这全是幻觉

859
01:46:58,355 --> 01:47:02,917
这全是…幻觉

860
01:47:06,831 --> 01:47:09,264
听着

861
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,374
[西班牙语]女士们,先生们

862
01:48:25,516 --> 01:48:29,417
[西班牙语]欢迎光临寂静酒吧

863
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:35,515
[西班牙语]下面丽贝卡.德.瑞为我们演唱

864
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:17,896
贝蒂

865
01:53:21,037 --> 01:53:22,936
贝蒂

866
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:36,750
[西班牙语]你在哪?

867
01:53:50,135 --> 01:53:52,034
贝蒂

868
01:55:57,807 --> 01:55:59,706
嗯

869
01:56:21,066 --> 01:56:23,829
嘿,靓女

870
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:25,834
该起床了

871
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:06,470
- 你去哪了?
- 你要干嘛?

872
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,638
来拿我的灯和盘子

873
01:58:11,286 --> 01:58:13,617
戴安妮,已经三个星期了

874
01:58:15,824 --> 01:58:18,792
盘子放到那个箱子里了

875
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:42,311
- 那是我的烟灰缸
- 拿走吧

876
01:58:53,798 --> 01:58:56,129
什么时候都行

877
01:58:56,234 --> 01:58:58,827
我只是想确认一下,戴安妮

878
01:59:07,813 --> 01:59:10,144
就这些了吗?

879
01:59:10,250 --> 01:59:12,149
是的

880
01:59:16,523 --> 01:59:19,787
顺便说一下,那两个探员又来找过你

881
02:00:13,751 --> 02:00:14,717
卡米拉

882
02:00:14,752 --> 02:00:15,649
卡米拉

883
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:20,223
你终于回来了

884
02:02:01,802 --> 02:02:04,895
刚才你说什么?美人

885
02:02:06,006 --> 02:02:08,269
我说

886
02:02:08,376 --> 02:02:10,275
你令我疯狂

887
02:02:23,593 --> 02:02:25,492
我们不该再这样做

888
02:02:32,435 --> 02:02:34,334
不要这样说

889
02:02:39,577 --> 02:02:42,170
永远不要这样说

890
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:44,577
不要,戴安妮

891
02:02:44,682 --> 02:02:47,548
住手,戴安妮,住手

892
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:51,184
我以前已经跟你说过

893
02:03:00,432 --> 02:03:02,661
因为他,对吗?

894
02:03:13,379 --> 02:03:16,404
我不是教怎么演这出戏

895
02:03:16,517 --> 02:03:19,076
你只需要…看着我做

896
02:03:19,186 --> 02:03:21,278
相信你会明白我的意思

897
02:03:21,388 --> 02:03:23,287
汉克

898
02:03:26,227 --> 02:03:28,558
不要坐得那么拘谨

899
02:03:28,663 --> 02:03:31,256
放松

900
02:03:31,399 --> 02:03:34,162
现在是二人世界

901
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:36,328
非常的惬意

902
02:03:37,973 --> 02:03:40,702
就像你们以前认识

903
02:03:40,810 --> 02:03:43,710
即使什么也不说也很惬意

904
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:47,780
汉克,可以清一下场吗?

905
02:03:47,883 --> 02:03:50,544
这里太多人了,让我们把这演完

906
02:03:50,654 --> 02:03:53,121
清场,请清场

907
02:03:53,224 --> 02:03:55,214
大家都喝咖啡去

908
02:03:55,325 --> 02:03:58,725
- 请!
- 戴安妮可以留下吗?

909
02:03:58,863 --> 02:04:01,057
当然可以

910
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:04,167
- 汉克,让戴安妮留下
- 戴安妮?

911
02:04:10,542 --> 02:04:12,441
当她开始哭的时候

912
02:04:12,543 --> 02:04:14,442
不要拉她过来

913
02:04:16,181 --> 02:04:18,341
让她自己靠过来

914
02:04:19,451 --> 02:04:21,315
让她靠过来

915
02:04:24,891 --> 02:04:31,295
你吻她是个连贯的动作

916
02:04:33,234 --> 02:04:35,133
中间是没有停顿的

917
02:05:01,164 --> 02:05:03,063
熄灯

918
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,475
卡米拉,别发癫了

919
02:05:14,578 --> 02:05:17,910
- 不要这样
- 当然不会

920
02:05:18,015 --> 02:05:20,710
你想让我视而不见吗?不

921
02:05:20,819 --> 02:05:23,878
没门,不会的

922
02:05:23,988 --> 02:05:26,615
- 我可不是好糊弄的
- 戴安妮

923
02:06:50,883 --> 02:06:52,782
喂,是我

924
02:06:52,884 --> 02:06:54,942
请留言

925
02:06:57,056 --> 02:06:58,955
戴安妮?

926
02:07:03,330 --> 02:07:06,196
- 喂
- 戴安妮?

927
02:07:07,935 --> 02:07:12,031
- 卡米拉
- 戴安妮,车正在等着

928
02:07:12,139 --> 02:07:14,106
你没事吧?

929
02:07:14,208 --> 02:07:16,107
你来吗?

930
02:07:20,415 --> 02:07:23,747
好的

931
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:25,750
这对我来说太有意义了

932
02:07:27,022 --> 02:07:29,615
快点吧,车就在你门外等着

933
02:07:30,859 --> 02:07:32,758
一直在等你,知道吗?

934
02:07:37,934 --> 02:07:39,764
好的

935
02:07:39,869 --> 02:07:43,360
穆赫兰道6980号

936
02:07:44,841 --> 02:07:46,740
穆赫兰道

937
02:08:56,553 --> 02:08:59,680
你要做什么?我们不是在这停的呀!

938
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,859
让你惊喜一下

939
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:31,520
捷径

940
02:09:33,326 --> 02:09:35,225
来吧,甜心

941
02:09:41,735 --> 02:09:43,827
很美

942
02:09:43,938 --> 02:09:45,837
一条秘道

943
02:10:53,078 --> 02:10:55,045
时间正好

944
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:58,649
欢迎你,戴安妮

945
02:11:04,825 --> 02:11:07,019
那么

946
02:11:07,128 --> 02:11:09,152
为爱干杯

947
02:11:18,874 --> 02:11:21,137
为爱干杯

948
02:11:25,615 --> 02:11:27,411
她来了

949
02:11:29,252 --> 02:11:31,151
噢

950
02:11:36,994 --> 02:11:38,984
你没见过我母亲吧

951
02:11:40,630 --> 02:11:43,063
嗨,我是戴安妮.西恩

952
02:11:43,167 --> 02:11:45,828
叫我可可就行了,大家都这样叫我

953
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:48,403
幸会,去吃东西吧

954
02:11:48,505 --> 02:11:50,404
我饿了

955
02:11:56,649 --> 02:11:58,741
抱歉我迟到了

956
02:12:18,472 --> 02:12:21,235
我来自安大略的深湖镇

957
02:12:22,442 --> 02:12:24,341
一个小镇

958
02:12:24,445 --> 02:12:27,743
你从加拿大远道而来

959
02:12:29,083 --> 02:12:31,277
我一直想来这里

960
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:35,210
因为一场吉特巴舞的比赛的胜利

961
02:12:36,458 --> 02:12:38,288
让我有了演戏的欲望

962
02:12:40,229 --> 02:12:42,594
你知道,是想演戏

963
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:46,799
我姨妈死的时候

964
02:12:48,004 --> 02:12:51,564
留了些钱给我

965
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:54,301
- 她在这工作过
- 和电影有关吗?

966
02:12:55,579 --> 02:12:58,046
是的

967
02:12:58,181 --> 02:13:00,648
你怎么认识卡米拉的?

968
02:13:02,453 --> 02:13:04,647
通过“西尔维亚诺兹故事”

969
02:13:04,755 --> 02:13:06,654
卡米拉演的很好

970
02:13:06,757 --> 02:13:09,657
[卡米拉讲西班牙语]

971
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,727
[西班牙语]

972
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:20,669
是的

973
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,840
我是很想做女主角

974
02:13:26,346 --> 02:13:28,779
不过卡米拉得到了这个角色

975
02:13:32,219 --> 02:13:34,709
导演…

976
02:13:34,855 --> 02:13:37,084
鲍勃.保波克

977
02:13:37,191 --> 02:13:39,090
是的

978
02:13:41,362 --> 02:13:43,261
他没怎么考虑过我

979
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:51,302
我们就在那时成为朋友的

980
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:58,035
她帮过我,让我在她的电影里演一些角色

981
02:13:59,682 --> 02:14:01,581
我明白

982
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:19,429
因此我有物资

983
02:14:19,537 --> 02:14:21,470
她有人才

984
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:24,630
简直不能相信

985
02:14:24,742 --> 02:14:27,733
我想给法官买一辆劳斯莱斯

986
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:36,619
有时奇迹会出现

987
02:15:30,747 --> 02:15:32,976
最精彩的总是留到最后

988
02:15:36,019 --> 02:15:37,918
你来和大家说吧

989
02:15:38,021 --> 02:15:39,920
- 卡米拉
- 不,还是你来吧

990
02:15:44,228 --> 02:15:46,127
卡米拉和我…

991
02:15:58,777 --> 02:16:00,676
准备…

992
02:16:12,627 --> 02:16:15,527
不好意思

993
02:16:21,969 --> 02:16:23,902
我不要了

994
02:16:30,512 --> 02:16:33,241
就是这个女孩了

995
02:16:34,316 --> 02:16:37,148
别在这给我看

996
02:16:37,253 --> 02:16:41,120
不过是张明星照,人人都可以有的

997
02:16:42,592 --> 02:16:46,254
- 带钱了吗?
- 当然

998
02:16:58,475 --> 02:17:02,571
好的,把钱给我,我们就算成交了

999
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:08,246
你真想这么做吗?

1000
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:15,317
做梦都想

1001
02:17:26,707 --> 02:17:28,674
事成后,你会在我告诉你的地方找到这个

1002
02:17:43,291 --> 02:17:45,190
用来开什么的?

1003
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:13,879
[西班牙语]寂静

1004
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:28,270
MULHOLLAND DR.

1005
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:58,829
What are you doing?
We don't stop here!

1006
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:13,217
Get out of the car.

1007
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,884
The boys found this...

1008
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,552
on the floor in back
of the Caddy.

1009
00:08:56,804 --> 00:09:00,682
Yeah, they showed me.

1010
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,393
Could be unrelated.

1011
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,020
Could be.

1012
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:10,983
Any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?

1013
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,655
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

1014
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:20,367
That's what I'm thinkin'.

1015
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,697
Just one more bag after that.

1016
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:48,048
I just wanted to come here.

1017
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:50,926
To Winkie's?

1018
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:54,220
This Winkie's.

1019
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:58,933
Okay.
Why this Winkie's?

1020
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,730
It's kind of embarrassing...

1021
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:09,235
Go ahead.

1022
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:11,070
I had a dream about this place.

1023
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,738
Oh boy.

1024
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:16,450
You see what I mean?

1025
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:21,704
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

1026
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,916
Tell me.

1027
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:30,463
Well...

1028
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,756
it's the second one I've had...

1029
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:36,427
but they are both the same...

1030
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,762
they start out that I'm in here but...

1031
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:43,016
it's not day or night.

1032
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:46,311
It's kinda half night, you know?...

1033
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:49,147
but it
looks just like this...

1034
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:52,484
except for the light.

1035
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:56,862
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

1036
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,866
Of all people,

1037
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:03,827
you're standing right over there...

1038
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:10,292
by that counter.

1039
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,756
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

1040
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:21,344
I get even more frightened when I see
how afraid you are and...

1041
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:27,308
then I realize what it is.

1042
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:32,856
There's a man...

1043
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:36,734
in back of this place.

1044
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:41,113
He's the one who's doing it.

1045
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,408
I can see him through the wall.

1046
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:48,119
I can see his face...

1047
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,042
I hope that I never see that face ever...

1048
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:59,338
outside of the dream.

1049
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,973
That's it.

1050
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,767
So...

1051
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:16,438
you came to see if it's out there?

1052
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,985
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

1053
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:27,448
Right thing.

1054
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:16,369
It's around here.

1055
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:29,188
Dan? You all right?
Dan? Dan?

1056
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:58,257
Hello?

1057
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:03,762
The girl is still missing.

1058
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:23,823
Talk to me.

1059
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,493
The same.

1060
00:18:04,153 --> 00:18:07,656
Oh...
I can't believe it!

1061
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:39,728
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

1062
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,730
It's
been so nice travelling with you.

1063
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,274
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

1064
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,943
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

1065
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,446
Remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.

1066
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:53,115
Okay Irene.
Won't that be the day.

1067
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,327
Good luck, Betty dear.

1068
00:18:56,578 --> 00:18:59,122
Take care of yourself and be careful.

1069
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,499
I will. Thanks again.

1070
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:02,958
Thanks again.

1071
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,003
Betty, it was so nice meeting you
All the luck in the world.

1072
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:09,547
Bye.

1073
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,598
My bags!

1074
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,476
Where to?

1075
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:25,187
1612 Havenhurst.

1076
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:29,608
Got it!

1077
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:47,265
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

1078
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:50,018
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

1079
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,019
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

1080
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,064
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

1081
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,900
Pleased to meet you.
- Just call me Coco.

1082
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,570
Everybody else does.
Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

1083
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:04,907
OK, Coco.

1084
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:10,662
Wilkins?!
Wilkins?!?!

1085
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:14,666
If that damned dog craps in the courtyard
one more time...

1086
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,169
I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast.

1087
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,588
You don't have pets do you?
- No, I don't.

1088
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,092
They're allowed,
I just don't like 'em here... for obvious reasons.

1089
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,719
You know, there was a man that lived here once...

1090
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:29,471
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

1091
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,849
Well, You just wouldn't believe...

1092
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,894
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

1093
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:39,022
Let's see your Aunt's apartment
... it's a good one.

1094
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:42,734
I can hardly wait!

1095
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,616
It's unbelievable!

1096
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,953
I told ya.
- Wow!

1097
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:58,165
Well, you and your Aunt probably have an understanding,
so here's the key.

1098
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,960
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

1099
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,463
Everybody in this building's
pretty much okay with me...

1100
00:22:04,713 --> 00:22:07,131
or they wouldn't be here.

1101
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:10,552
If you want, later on
I'll introduce you around.

1102
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:15,014
No hard feelings if you don't.

1103
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:42,930
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
me someone was going to be here.

1104
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:46,350
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK

1105
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:48,644
I'm Ruth's niece.
My name's Betty. I'm
sure she told you I was coming.

1106
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:52,398
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

1107
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,399
There was an accident.

1108
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,568
I came here.

1109
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:59,237
I understand.
I saw the dress.

1110
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,074
Sorry. Are you all right?

1111
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:06,286
What happened?

1112
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,955
A car...

1113
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,834
a car accident.

1114
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:16,879
Oh... You OK?

1115
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,924
I think so.

1116
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:22,467
I was just...

1117
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,469
taking a shower.

1118
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,471
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

1119
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:31,518
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm going to get unpacked.

1120
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,107
What's your name?

1121
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:46,073
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here
and we can talk later.

1122
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:24,818
My name's...
Rita.

1123
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:27,946
Hi...

1124
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:30,531
do you work with my Aunt?

1125
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:33,160
No... I...
- Sorry...

1126
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,539
it's none of my business.

1127
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,501
She has pretty red hair...

1128
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,837
She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...

1129
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:46,839
that's
being made in Canada...

1130
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,509
but I guess you already know that.

1131
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,012
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

1132
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:57,098
Unless of course I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

1133
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,393
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star,

1134
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,812
but sometimes people end up being both
and so that is,

1135
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:09,068
I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here.

1136
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,740
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited to be here...

1137
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,326
I mean I just came here from Deep River, Ontario...

1138
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,162
now I'm in this...

1139
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,122
dream place.

1140
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:26,126
You can imagine how I feel.

1141
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,677
Oh... What? Sit down...

1142
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,141
Where were you hurt?

1143
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,060
We should call a doctor.
- No

1144
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:47,855
But, this could be serious.
- No, I...

1145
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,690
I need to sleep.

1146
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,984
If you have a concussion
you shouldn't sleep.

1147
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:54,778
It will feel okay if I sleep.

1148
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,950
I just need to
lie down here and sleep.

1149
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,673
You see Adam... there are some suggestions

1150
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:01,883
that are to be brought forward ...

1151
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:05,053
and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions

1152
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:09,348
and that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

1153
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,559
What are you talking about?

1154
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,186
An open mind...

1155
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:17,481
You're in the process of
re-casting your lead actress and

1156
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:19,483
I'm...

1157
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:25,406
We're asking you to
keep an open mind.

1158
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:37,958
What was it last time?

1159
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:41,712
OK. Let's try the next one.

1160
00:28:41,963 --> 00:28:44,256
He's not gonna like it.

1161
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:47,593
We'll see.

1162
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,141
Ah... Castigliane brothers.

1163
00:28:55,392 --> 00:28:58,811
Let me introduce you around...

1164
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:02,023
please ... take a seat.

1165
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,317
this is Mr. Darby,
whom you know

1166
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:07,987
and this is the director Adam Kesher...

1167
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:12,992
and his manager Robert Smith.

1168
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,357
Oh,

1169
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:50,026
She's very pretty.

1170
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:55,074
May I offer you, gentlemen...
anything?

1171
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,243
Espresso.
- Nothing.

1172
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:03,456
- What's the photo for?
- An espresso.

1173
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,667
No, that's it.

1174
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,960
I think you're gonna enjoy your espresso
this time.

1175
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:11,714
I've done quite a bit of a research
knowing how hard you are to please.

1176
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:14,382
This one comes highly recommended.

1177
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,511
What's the photo for?

1178
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:19,763
It's a recommendation...

1179
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:23,934
a recommendation to you, Adam,

1180
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:27,937
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

1181
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:31,816
What girl?. For what?.
What is this, Ray?.

1182
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:36,321
We'd be happy to put her
on the list for consideration.

1183
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:41,784
You'd be pleased to know
there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

1184
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,327
Interest?. No.

1185
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:47,123
There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

1186
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:48,791
This is the girl.

1187
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:51,960
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, Adam.

1188
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:53,962
Hold on?.

1189
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:58,133
There's no way.
There's no way!

1190
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:14,481
Napkin.

1191
00:31:14,732 --> 00:31:17,943
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

1192
00:31:18,194 --> 00:31:20,654
Of course.

1193
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:24,323
Excuse me.

1194
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:42,966
Is that all sir?.

1195
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,437
Shit.

1196
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:42,105
Sorry!
That was a highly recommended...

1197
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:44,608
That's considered one of the finest
espressos in the world, Sir.

1198
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:48,362
What's going on here?
There's no way that girl is in my movie.

1199
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:51,865
HELP ME!!!

1200
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,574
This is the girl.

1201
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:58,788
Hey!
That girl is not in my film!

1202
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:04,043
It's no longer your film.

1203
00:33:07,547 --> 00:33:11,008
This is the girl.

1204
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:51,921
Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
that limo?

1205
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,174
- They two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

1206
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:58,552
- Yes.
- Keep that door open.

1207
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,146
Castigliane brothers?

1208
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:12,816
Beat it, pal.

1209
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:59,235
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

1210
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:04,031
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

1211
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:08,827
The director doesn't want her.

1212
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:14,708
Do you want him replaced?.

1213
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:19,087
I know they said...

1214
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,965
Then?

1215
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:24,383
Then...

1216
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:28,053
that means we should...

1217
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:33,183
Yes?.

1218
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,185
Shut everything down ...

1219
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:38,772
Is that something that...

1220
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:41,275
do you want us...

1221
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:44,986
to shut everything down?

1222
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,202
Then we'll shut everything down.

1223
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:24,482
Oh man, that's unheard of ...

1224
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:29,362
an accident like that ...
who could have foreseen that?

1225
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,031
- That's unreal, right?

1226
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,783
Hell, right.

1227
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:38,662
Unbelievable.

1228
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,002
So, bro, God you're good!

1229
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:48,004
What have you been doin'?

1230
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:51,466
Just doin' some stuff
for this guy.

1231
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:54,593
Yeah?. Making ends meet, huh?

1232
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:58,430
Hardly.

1233
00:36:58,431 --> 00:36:59,974
I know, man.

1234
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:03,101
Look at my digs.

1235
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:06,438
Times are tough, bro.

1236
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:10,818
Hey, man,
it's not that bad.

1237
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,819
I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.

1238
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,863
It was just a thing.

1239
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:16,864
The story made you laugh.

1240
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:22,078
- It was a funny story.
- Fucking car accident.

1241
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,166
It's it?...

1242
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:31,253
It's the famous black book.

1243
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:38,218
The history of the world
in phone numbers.

1244
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,790
Oh, man!.

1245
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:25,388
Something bit me
BAD!

1246
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,298
God!

1247
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,602
Hey man!

1248
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:20,314
She's hurt bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone. Please I need you!

1249
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:25,110
She's hurt bad!
You gotta call the hospital

1250
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:27,112
Come on man!
I'm serious about this!

1251
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:31,450
I can't do everything by myself!

1252
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,596
Hey man!.

1253
00:40:33,676 --> 00:40:37,137
OH!

1254
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,195
...okay Aunt Ruth... I'll try.

1255
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:59,449
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know them inside out.

1256
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,661
Yep, either here
on this fabulous leather couch...

1257
00:41:02,912 --> 00:41:04,663
or I'll take them with a coffee in the courtyard...

1258
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:07,541
like a regular movie star.

1259
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,084
Oh! I got a real
shock to find your friend Rita here.

1260
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:14,922
She was in the shower and I opened the
door ...

1261
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,760
... what do you mean?

1262
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,054
... She was in an accident.

1263
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:26,475
... Rita, your friend.

1264
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:30,478
No, Coco unlocked the door.

1265
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,482
... No, she didn't see her.

1266
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,609
... She's sleeping.

1267
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,569
I'm sure there's some explanation for this
Aunt Ruth,

1268
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,573
I don't think we have to do that.

1269
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:48,871
Please don't worry...
we don't need the police.

1270
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,802
You're awake...

1271
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:08,598
I think I misunderstood.

1272
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,268
I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here.

1273
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,648
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
to call the police.

1274
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm... sorry. I ...

1275
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:33,872
What is it Rita?

1276
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,460
I thought when I woke up...

1277
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,295
I thought sleep would do it...

1278
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:44,423
What's wrong?

1279
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:47,927
I don't know who I am.

1280
00:42:48,178 --> 00:42:50,138
What do you mean?
You're Rita.

1281
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:54,475
I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

1282
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:59,145
I don't know who I am!!

1283
00:43:08,071 --> 00:43:13,367
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

1284
00:43:13,618 --> 00:43:16,954
You want to know, don't you?

1285
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:20,916
I ... yes, but ... I ...
- Open it!

1286
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:58,133
You sure you don't want anything?
- Not here...no thanks.

1287
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:01,011
Not a coke or something?

1288
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,762
No... thanks though...

1289
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:07,225
I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.

1290
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:12,730
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

1291
00:45:16,192 --> 00:45:19,862
Any new girls on the street lately?

1292
00:45:22,865 --> 00:45:26,284
No.  I haven't seen any.

1293
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:28,287
A brunette?

1294
00:45:28,537 --> 00:45:31,956
... maybe a little beat up?

1295
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:39,422
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't
you baby?

1296
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:44,427
- Sure.
- You bet you will.

1297
00:45:45,928 --> 00:45:49,389
That money.

1298
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:55,020
You don't know where it came from?

1299
00:45:55,563 --> 00:46:01,401
When you think of them...
the money... the key...

1300
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,280
does it make you remember anything?

1301
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:10,743
something ...

1302
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:14,956
...something there is.

1303
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:27,342
What did you say?

1304
00:46:27,593 --> 00:46:29,511
They fired everyone.

1305
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:31,804
Who fired everyone?

1306
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:36,183
Ray did!
Please I'm talking on the phone,

1307
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:39,353
and then they closed the set...
everybody's gone.

1308
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:43,023
You'd better
get down here Adam!

1309
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:46,944
You've got to talk to Ray
you've got to fix this.

1310
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:48,654
I'm going home.

1311
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:50,197
Home?!

1312
00:46:50,448 --> 00:46:52,199
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something...

1313
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:54,201
... you've got to do something Adam!

1314
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:56,369
I'm going home, Cynthia.

1315
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,455
Adam, this isn't like you.

1316
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:00,123
Please come to the office.

1317
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:04,502
- There must be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

1318
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:17,890
I wonder where you were going.

1319
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:24,938
Mulholland drive.

1320
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,819
Mulholland drive?

1321
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:34,572
That's where I was going...

1322
00:47:34,823 --> 00:47:38,826
Mulholland Drive.

1323
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,747
Maybe that's where the accident was.

1324
00:47:42,997 --> 00:47:46,500
There must be a police report.
We could call...

1325
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,502
We could call anonymously from a pay phone...

1326
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:51,672
just to see if there was an accident.

1327
00:47:51,922 --> 00:47:54,340
Come on. It'll be just like in the movies.

1328
00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:58,553
We'll pretend to be someone else.

1329
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:00,639
I want to walk around anyway.

1330
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:04,100
I'm
in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any of it.

1331
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,813
Come on Rita.
Do you feel up to it?

1332
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:20,366
Okay... but just

1333
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:23,159
...just to see.

1334
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,413
Just to see
if there was an accident...

1335
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:31,626
on Mulholland Drive.

1336
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,501
Lorraine?

1337
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:19,212
Lorraine... you home?

1338
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,965
Lorraine...

1339
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:46,488
Now, you've done it!

1340
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:52,118
Just forget you ever saw.
It's better that way.

1341
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:57,915
What the hell are you even doing here?

1342
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:12,429
What are you doing?

1343
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:16,809
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!!!

1344
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:35,868
That bastard
You bastard!

1345
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,789
He's probably upset Lorraine.

1346
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:48,297
WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???

1347
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:51,425
STOP IT!!!
STOP IT!!!

1348
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,718
Adam, STOP IT!!!

1349
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:57,096
STOP IT!!!
STOP IT!!!

1350
00:50:57,347 --> 00:51:01,767
Adam, STOP IT!!!

1351
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:07,606
What're you doin'
You're hurting me!

1352
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,947
That's not a way to treat your wife, buddy.
I don't care what she's done.

1353
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,116
Throw him out!

1354
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:25,456
Throw him out!

1355
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,256
Get out!

1356
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:15,545
Let's hide it.

1357
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:02,756
There's one.

1358
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,855
Hollywood Police Department

1359
00:53:19,106 --> 00:53:22,609
I'm inquiring about an accident that
happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

1360
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:26,737
Hold please.
I'll connect you to traffic.

1361
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:32,243
- Sergeant Baxter,
- Hi. I'm inquiring...

1362
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:35,955
well, I heard a sound last night
that sounded sort of like a carcrash and

1363
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:40,083
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

1364
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:42,085
Yes, there was.

1365
00:53:42,336 --> 00:53:45,213
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No. I can't.

1366
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:49,759
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name please?

1367
00:53:55,182 --> 00:53:57,267
There was an accident.

1368
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:59,310
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident Rita.

1369
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:03,022
I just know it was.

1370
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:05,440
Maybe there's something about it in the papers.

1371
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:09,444
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee
and we can see.

1372
00:54:12,156 --> 00:54:15,617
Maybe it happened so late it's not going
to be in today's paper.

1373
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:19,329
There's nothing?

1374
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:22,958
Not that I can see.

1375
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:26,294
That's Ok.

1376
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:30,173
Thanks...

1377
00:54:30,423 --> 00:54:35,177
... Diane.

1378
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:41,809
That'd be all?
You want your check?

1379
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,395
Rita, you want something?

1380
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:52,652
- No. Just the coffee.
- I'll take our check.

1381
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:01,952
What is it Rita?
-Shhhh.

1382
00:55:08,501 --> 00:55:11,962
I remember something...

1383
00:55:16,216 --> 00:55:19,510
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

1384
00:55:19,761 --> 00:55:23,723
Maybe that's my name.

1385
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,438
D.Selwyn ... it's the only one.

1386
00:55:31,689 --> 00:55:35,150
I'm gonna call.

1387
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:43,033
It's strange to be calling yourself.

1388
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:46,744
Maybe it's not me.

1389
00:55:54,044 --> 00:55:55,795
Hello... this is me.

1390
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:59,423
Leave me a message.

1391
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:03,469
It's not my voice...

1392
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:07,180
but I know her.

1393
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,934
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

1394
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:13,228
Maybe that's your roommate...

1395
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:15,689
or if it is Diane Selwyn...

1396
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,983
she can tell you who you are.

1397
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:24,906
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.

1398
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:06,778
- Yeah, right ... get lost!
- Is this Adam Kesher's house?

1399
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:08,572
Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!

1400
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:11,908
Get out!

1401
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,253
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

1402
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:27,757
I guess you don't understand English.
She said to leave.

1403
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:30,759
Here's the door.

1404
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:35,138
OUT!

1405
00:58:03,624 --> 00:58:06,251
- Yeah...what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry Mr. Kesher...

1406
00:58:06,502 --> 00:58:10,338
but there seems tobe some problem
with your credit cards.

1407
00:58:10,589 --> 00:58:14,843
What??... I pay you cash, Cookie.

1408
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:19,973
Fact is two guys from your bank came by.

1409
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:22,641
My bank?

1410
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:27,104
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

1411
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,397
What did they say?

1412
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:32,943
I'm afraid they said
you're maxed out at your bank...

1413
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:37,990
and your line of credit has been cancelled.

1414
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:41,576
It's unbelievable.

1415
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:44,955
Look...

1416
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:48,875
I don't know what's going on.

1417
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,586
That's so much baloney.

1418
00:58:53,588 --> 00:58:55,631
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

1419
00:58:55,882 --> 00:58:57,967
I known... I known...

1420
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:00,010
Don't worry...

1421
00:59:00,261 --> 00:59:02,888
I'm sorry.

1422
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,558
It was my duty to inform you.

1423
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:14,732
People you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

1424
00:59:15,025 --> 00:59:17,986
Right.

1425
00:59:18,028 --> 00:59:21,155
I'm sorry

1426
00:59:43,343 --> 00:59:44,469
Hello?

1427
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:46,512
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

1428
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:48,514
I know.
Where are you Adam?

1429
00:59:48,765 --> 00:59:50,808
What do you mean you know?

1430
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,810
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you...

1431
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:55,229
they told me you were as good as broke.

1432
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,523
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

1433
00:59:57,773 --> 00:59:59,941
- And?
- You're broke!

1434
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:01,568
But I'm not broke!

1435
01:00:01,819 --> 01:00:06,073
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

1436
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:08,616
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

1437
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:13,287
Do you know somebody called the "The Cowboy"?

1438
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:15,665
- "The Cowboy"?
- Yes

1439
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,375
Yeah, the Cowboy.

1440
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:20,502
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

1441
01:00:20,753 --> 01:00:24,631
Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

1442
01:00:24,924 --> 01:00:27,968
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea
for me to go to see the Cowboy.

1443
01:00:28,219 --> 01:00:31,346
Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?

1444
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:36,101
Listen. Something tells me this guy is connected
to what's happening,

1445
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:40,021
and I think you should do it and I think you should
do it right away.

1446
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:42,023
What's going on, Cynthia?

1447
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:46,194
It's been a very strange day...

1448
01:00:46,569 --> 01:00:49,988
and getting stranger.

1449
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:54,785
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean...
do I have to ride out to the range?

1450
01:00:55,036 --> 01:00:57,079
Sort of, funny boy.

1451
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,165
If I tell him the
meeting's on...

1452
01:00:59,415 --> 01:01:02,042
you have to go to the top of
Beachwood Canyon.

1453
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:06,129
There's a corral up there where he'll be.

1454
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,840
You've got to be kidding me!

1455
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,259
Will you meet with him?

1456
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,553
Yeah, sure.

1457
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,930
It's been that kind of a day.
When?

1458
01:01:17,182 --> 01:01:19,100
I'll call him, right away...

1459
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:21,852
then I'll call you back.

1460
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:27,024
You could stay at my place, if you want it.

1461
01:01:27,274 --> 01:01:29,234
Cynthia... I don't think it'll be a good idea.

1462
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,570
I'm just offering a place to stay.

1463
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,864
And I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

1464
01:01:35,115 --> 01:01:38,326
Now go on and give the Cowboy a yodel
and get back to me.

1465
01:01:38,577 --> 01:01:42,080
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

1466
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:47,126
Just get along little dowgie and call me back.

1467
01:01:57,511 --> 01:01:59,763
It's right about here on Sierra Bonita.

1468
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:02,850
That's not too far away.

1469
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,894
What's wrong with that?

1470
01:02:06,144 --> 01:02:09,605
I'm not sure about this.

1471
01:02:09,981 --> 01:02:13,275
I know you're afraid of something.

1472
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:17,196
We'll be careful. Promise.

1473
01:02:17,238 --> 01:02:20,699
Tomorrow we'll go over there...

1474
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,495
and we'll find out.

1475
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:39,342
It'll be okay.

1476
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,180
It's probabily Coco

1477
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,392
Yes?

1478
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:48,809
May I help you?

1479
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,688
Someone is in trouble.

1480
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:55,691
Who are you?

1481
01:02:55,941 --> 01:02:58,610
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

1482
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:00,779
She's letting me stay here.

1483
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,448
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

1484
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:05,242
No it's not.

1485
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:07,910
That's not what she said.

1486
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:12,665
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

1487
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:16,252
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are
and...

1488
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:20,964
Louise...
What are you doing Louise?

1489
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:25,135
Oh, Coco! I've been
trying to find you all afternoon since
3:00 o'clock.

1490
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,555
That one is in my room
and she won't leave.

1491
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:32,476
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

1492
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:35,311
This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she
meant well.

1493
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,482
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

1494
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,610
In fact and
fortunately I was just on my way here to see Betty.

1495
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,405
Betty's a young actress and I was just delivering...

1496
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,824
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

1497
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,660
- Well, here they are honey.
- Oh, thank you.

1498
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,329
Now come along Louise
and I'll take you home.

1499
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,290
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes.
Come on.

1500
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,876
No, she said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

1501
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:03,046
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home...

1502
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,132
Come on.

1503
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:07,967
- Goodnight Betty.
- Goodnight.

1504
01:04:08,218 --> 01:04:11,304
Goodnight.

1505
01:04:49,298 --> 01:04:52,259
Cowboy!

1506
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:03,409
- Howdy!
- Howdy to you.

1507
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:07,288
Beautiful evening.

1508
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,626
Sure want to thank ya for coming
all theway up to see me...

1509
01:06:12,877 --> 01:06:17,548
from that nice hotel Downtown.

1510
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:20,509
No problem.
What's on your mind?.

1511
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,097
Well now, here's a man who wants to get
right down to it.

1512
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,974
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

1513
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:31,144
Whatever.

1514
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:34,063
A man's attitude...

1515
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:36,941
... a man's attitude
goes some ways

1516
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:39,819
the way his life will be.

1517
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:43,155
Is that somethin' you might agree with?

1518
01:06:43,406 --> 01:06:45,032
Sure.

1519
01:06:45,283 --> 01:06:48,953
Now... did you answer because you thought
that's what I wanted to hear...

1520
01:06:49,203 --> 01:06:51,246
or did you think about what I said...

1521
01:06:51,497 --> 01:06:56,460
and answer cause you
truly believe that to be right?

1522
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:02,256
I agree with what you said... truly.

1523
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:05,968
What did I say?

1524
01:07:07,262 --> 01:07:12,516
That a man's attitude determines to a
large extent how his life will be.

1525
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:15,060
So since you agree...

1526
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:20,148
you must be a person who does not care about the good life.

1527
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:24,110
How's that?

1528
01:07:24,194 --> 01:07:28,030
Well, stop for a little second and
think about it.

1529
01:07:28,282 --> 01:07:32,035
Can you do that for me?

1530
01:07:32,911 --> 01:07:37,456
Okay, I'm thinking.

1531
01:07:39,417 --> 01:07:41,252
No. You're not thinkin'

1532
01:07:41,502 --> 01:07:45,630
You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

1533
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:50,010
Now I want ya to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

1534
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:52,429
Can you try that for me?

1535
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:57,225
Look ... where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

1536
01:07:57,476 --> 01:07:59,894
There's sometimes a buggy.

1537
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:03,272
How many drivers does a buggy have?

1538
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:05,274
One.

1539
01:08:05,525 --> 01:08:08,569
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy...

1540
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:13,574
and you if fix your attitude you can
ride along with me.

1541
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:15,117
Okay.

1542
01:08:15,368 --> 01:08:19,163
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

1543
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:21,706
You were re-casting the lead
actress anyway...

1544
01:08:21,957 --> 01:08:25,877
audition many girls for
the part.

1545
01:08:26,128 --> 01:08:30,924
When you see the girl that was
shown to you earlier today, you will say:

1546
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:34,301
This is the girl.

1547
01:08:34,552 --> 01:08:36,887
The rest of the cast can stay.

1548
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:39,598
That is up to you.

1549
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:44,228
But that lead girl is not up to you.

1550
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,439
Now, you will see me one more time...

1551
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:50,108
if you do good.

1552
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,236
You will see me two more times...

1553
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:55,655
if you do bad.

1554
01:08:55,906 --> 01:08:59,033
Good night.

1555
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:24,307
You're still here?

1556
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:27,185
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

1557
01:09:27,436 --> 01:09:30,021
Nobody wants you here!

1558
01:09:30,272 --> 01:09:31,940
Really?

1559
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,650
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

1560
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:38,904
- So... surprise...
- I can call them... I can call my dad...

1561
01:09:39,155 --> 01:09:41,156
But you won't...

1562
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:44,534
If you're trying to blackmail me...
it's not going to work.

1563
01:09:44,785 --> 01:09:46,620
You're playing a dangerous game here.

1564
01:09:46,871 --> 01:09:49,039
You know what I want...
it's not that difficult.

1565
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:52,668
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad ...

1566
01:09:52,918 --> 01:09:55,879
he trusts you...
you're his best friend.

1567
01:09:56,129 --> 01:09:58,422
This will be the end of everything.

1568
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:01,717
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

1569
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:06,305
Stop! Just stop! That's what you said
from the beginning.

1570
01:10:06,431 --> 01:10:09,475
If I tell what happened...
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

1571
01:10:09,725 --> 01:10:11,560
so get out of here before...

1572
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:15,147
Before what?

1573
01:10:15,397 --> 01:10:18,441
Before I kill you.

1574
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:22,528
Then they'd put you in jail.

1575
01:10:24,197 --> 01:10:27,992
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion:

1576
01:10:28,243 --> 01:10:32,497
I hate you... I hate us both!

1577
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:35,666
Such a lame scene.

1578
01:10:35,917 --> 01:10:39,003
But you are really good.

1579
01:10:39,253 --> 01:10:42,339
Thank you dahling!

1580
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,228
Hi there!

1581
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,606
Who are you?

1582
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:14,911
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

1583
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:32,887
- What is it Coco?
- Your aunt called

1584
01:11:33,054 --> 01:11:34,346
I was afraid of that.

1585
01:11:34,597 --> 01:11:38,517
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

1586
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:41,895
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

1587
01:11:42,146 --> 01:11:44,398
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

1588
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:47,484
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

1589
01:11:47,735 --> 01:11:49,736
I kept telling her it was my friend Rita...

1590
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:53,532
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas...

1591
01:11:53,782 --> 01:11:55,658
Look at me straight, sweetie.

1592
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:57,827
Coco... she's very nice.

1593
01:11:58,078 --> 01:11:59,662
Honey... you're a good kid.

1594
01:11:59,913 --> 01:12:03,082
What you're telling me is a load of horse-pucky

1595
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,960
even though it comes from a good place.

1596
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:09,337
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out

1597
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:13,050
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

1598
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,427
Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there.

1599
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:17,429
Remember last night?

1600
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,057
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

1601
01:12:21,308 --> 01:12:26,562
but if there is trouble
get rid of it.

1602
01:12:35,321 --> 01:12:37,239
Is everything all right?

1603
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,199
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

1604
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:42,577
No, no, everything is A-okay.

1605
01:12:42,828 --> 01:12:44,829
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

1606
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:49,542
And my audition is in one hour.

1607
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:10,729
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

1608
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,899
- Don't drink all the coke.
- Good luck!

1609
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:17,235
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.

1610
01:13:17,486 --> 01:13:20,905
- Okay.
- Okay?

1611
01:13:48,265 --> 01:13:50,141
Come in.

1612
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,228
Betty Elms, I'd like you to meet...

1613
01:13:53,478 --> 01:13:56,397
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

1614
01:13:56,648 --> 01:13:58,274
Woody Katz who we've
cast in the part...

1615
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:02,528
of "Chuck".
He'll do the scene with you.

1616
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,447
Bob Brooker, the director

1617
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:07,241
and Julie Chadwick...

1618
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:09,784
Now, our surprise guest is:

1619
01:14:10,035 --> 01:14:12,078
Linney James.

1620
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,414
Alas we can't afford her to cast our show,

1621
01:14:14,665 --> 01:14:17,292
but as casting agents go...

1622
01:14:17,543 --> 01:14:20,003
she's the best.

1623
01:14:20,253 --> 01:14:23,130
Why thank you, Wally.
Hello Betty.

1624
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:25,090
Very pleased to meet you.

1625
01:14:25,342 --> 01:14:29,053
This is my assistant, Nicki.

1626
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,388
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

1627
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:35,517
Martha Johnson, who
you met out front.

1628
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,978
Hi.

1629
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:42,441
So shall we get it to go?

1630
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:46,194
Would you like a water or a coffee
before we begin?

1631
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:48,196
No, no, I'm fine.

1632
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:53,451
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

1633
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:01,124
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

1634
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:04,003
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say...

1635
01:15:04,253 --> 01:15:07,130
something to Betty before we begin?

1636
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:11,259
No... it's not a contest,

1637
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:16,973
the two of them with themselves,

1638
01:15:17,349 --> 01:15:20,894
so don't play it for real...

1639
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:25,606
until it gets real.

1640
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:31,154
Okay.

1641
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:33,781
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

1642
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:34,948
What?

1643
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,200
Hey Bobby, I want to play this one nice and close,

1644
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:39,160
like
we did with that other girl,

1645
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:41,955
what's her name? The one with the black hair.
That felt kinda good.

1646
01:15:42,206 --> 01:15:43,707
- Whaddya think?
- That's good, Woody.

1647
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:46,250
Just don't rush that line again.

1648
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:50,963
I told you...
the line where you say, "Before what?"

1649
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,758
Bobby, acting is reacting...

1650
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,386
I just play off 'em. They all say:

1651
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,346
They're gonna arrest you like that...

1652
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,473
put you in jail...
They all say it the same way,

1653
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,934
so I react like that.

1654
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,186
What's your name?
- Betty

1655
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:10,941
Yeah... Betty, look... You don't rush it. I
don't rush it.

1656
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,943
We're gonna play it nice and close...

1657
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:18,614
just like in the movies. OK?

1658
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:23,119
Dad's best friend goes to work.

1659
01:16:27,665 --> 01:16:32,085
And ... ACTION!!!!

1660
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:39,134
You're still here?

1661
01:16:39,134 --> 01:16:42,553
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

1662
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:45,848
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

1663
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:50,269
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

1664
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,605
So ... surprise!

1665
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:56,067
I can call them...
I can call my dad...

1666
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:59,403
But you won't...

1667
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:18,004
You're playing a dangerous game here...

1668
01:17:18,213 --> 01:17:21,049
if you're trying to blackmail me...

1669
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:24,802
it's not gonna work.

1670
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:27,471
You know what I want..

1671
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:31,183
it's not that difficult.

1672
01:17:32,727 --> 01:17:35,813
Get out...

1673
01:17:36,397 --> 01:17:39,608
Get out before I call my dad.

1674
01:17:39,858 --> 01:17:41,943
He trusts you...

1675
01:17:42,194 --> 01:17:44,154
You're...

1676
01:17:44,404 --> 01:17:47,531
his best friend.

1677
01:17:50,285 --> 01:17:54,247
This will be the end of everything.

1678
01:17:55,415 --> 01:17:59,335
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

1679
01:17:59,585 --> 01:18:02,045
Stop...

1680
01:18:02,296 --> 01:18:05,382
stop it!

1681
01:18:05,758 --> 01:18:09,219
That's what you said from the beginning.

1682
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:12,347
If I tell them what happened...
they'll arrest you...

1683
01:18:12,597 --> 01:18:16,016
and put you in jail,

1684
01:18:21,648 --> 01:18:23,649
so get out of here...

1685
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,819
before...

1686
01:18:28,946 --> 01:18:32,073
Before what?

1687
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,634
Before...

1688
01:18:51,885 --> 01:18:55,388
I kill you.

1689
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:12,654
Then they'd put you in jail.

1690
01:19:20,495 --> 01:19:23,539
I hate you...

1691
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:27,417
I hate us both!

1692
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,185
- I'm going to take her over there.
- Yeah big time!

1693
01:19:48,897 --> 01:19:51,566
Wow!
Well, there it was.

1694
01:19:51,816 --> 01:19:54,026
There it was all right!

1695
01:19:54,277 --> 01:19:58,614
Baby, you got away with it!

1696
01:20:00,783 --> 01:20:03,493
Very good. Really.

1697
01:20:03,744 --> 01:20:06,204
I mean it was forced maybe...

1698
01:20:06,455 --> 01:20:10,291
but still humanistic.

1699
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:11,292
Yeah,

1700
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:13,294
very good,

1701
01:20:13,545 --> 01:20:17,632
really.

1702
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:24,847
Oh I thank you Betty...

1703
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:27,557
and I really mean that sincerely.

1704
01:20:27,808 --> 01:20:31,811
I mean, it was extraordinary.

1705
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:33,563
You've done your Aunt proud...

1706
01:20:33,814 --> 01:20:37,776
and I'm going to tell her
the first chance I get.

1707
01:20:38,026 --> 01:20:40,278
Now, you and I...

1708
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:42,280
are gonna speak again soon.

1709
01:20:42,531 --> 01:20:44,658
Thank you Mr.Brown.

1710
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:46,659
Thank you, Wally.

1711
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:50,037
I'm sure you all have a
lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

1712
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:54,041
Well, yes indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

1713
01:20:54,292 --> 01:20:56,669
Don't you be a stranger around here.

1714
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:59,838
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

1715
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,673
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

1716
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:06,303
It was nice meeting all of you.

1717
01:21:12,684 --> 01:21:15,436
Wow!

1718
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:17,438
How do you find her...

1719
01:21:17,689 --> 01:21:21,150
God, that was awful!

1720
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:23,819
Not you Betty.
You were stellar and I mean that

1721
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:25,696
But poor Wally.

1722
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:27,864
He'll never get that picture made.
- Why?

1723
01:21:28,115 --> 01:21:30,242
Wally's days were up twenty years ago.

1724
01:21:30,492 --> 01:21:33,453
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor?

1725
01:21:33,704 --> 01:21:35,664
And the cast is terrible...

1726
01:21:35,914 --> 01:21:37,790
Oh, God, terrible

1727
01:21:38,041 --> 01:21:40,168
Poor old fool Wally...

1728
01:21:40,418 --> 01:21:44,171
It was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

1729
01:21:44,422 --> 01:21:47,216
and Wally... Mr. Brown...
is a very close friendof my Aunt's, so...

1730
01:21:47,467 --> 01:21:50,219
Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
I love Wally.

1731
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:53,931
I ought to. I was married
to him for ten years.

1732
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:57,017
And I love actors, all actors.

1733
01:21:57,268 --> 01:22:00,354
We just get a little catty sometimes.

1734
01:22:00,604 --> 01:22:03,106
Now we want to take you across
and introduce you to a director...

1735
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:05,025
who's a head above the rest

1736
01:22:05,275 --> 01:22:08,069
He's got a project that you would kill!

1737
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,823
Knock it right out of the park.

1738
01:22:12,657 --> 01:22:14,700
~ Sixteen reasons ~

1739

Cut it!
Thank you very much, Carol.
I'm coming back.

1771
01:24:06,973 --> 01:24:09,183
Check it again?
Check it again!

1772
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:11,185
Thank you!
Will tell you what happens next!

1773
01:24:11,436 --> 01:24:14,480
Thank you very much, for coming in
I know how busy you are.

1774
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:17,608
Oh, are you kidding me? I love this script!
Show me where to sign!

1775
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:19,610
Look... I love you...

1776
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,362
but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing
until I've seen everyone.

1777
01:24:22,613 --> 01:24:24,364
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

1778
01:24:24,615 --> 01:24:28,493
cause my manager's
gonna be bugging you day and night.
... and me.

1779
01:24:28,744 --> 01:24:30,829
- It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here.
- Oh, you're just so cruel to me...

1780
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:33,206
don't forget me.
I'm the girl that's going to play this part.

1781
01:24:33,457 --> 01:24:36,710
See ya later.

1782
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,003
Hank... where's Hank?

1783
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:42,965
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

1784
01:24:43,049 --> 01:24:46,135
- Is she ready?
- Already.

1785
01:24:46,385 --> 01:24:50,305
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes next.

1786
01:24:55,144 --> 01:24:59,940
Sylvia North's story,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

1787
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:02,692
Ok, here we go...
Let's lock it up, please!

1788
01:25:02,943 --> 01:25:05,195
- Roll sound please...
- That's it!

1789
01:25:05,445 --> 01:25:08,906
Playback!
ACTION!

1790
01:25:21,335 --> 01:25:23,420
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

1791
01:25:23,671 --> 01:25:27,090

01:25:33,889 --> 01:25:38,852
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

1795
01:25:39,102 --> 01:25:40,978
Get Jason over here.

1796
01:25:41,229 --> 01:25:45,274
Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
~ I've told ripples in a brook ~

1797
01:25:45,525 --> 01:25:49,862
~ Made my heart an open book ~

1798
01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:57,035
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

1799
01:25:57,619 --> 01:26:01,205
~ Friends ask me "am I in love" ~

1800
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:05,459
~ I always answer "yes" ~

1801
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:09,463
~ Might as well confess ~

1802
01:26:09,714 --> 01:26:13,092
~ If the answer's yes ~

1803
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:17,470
~ Maybe you may love me too ~

1804
01:26:17,722 --> 01:26:23,268
~ Oh my darling if you do ~

1805
01:26:23,727 --> 01:26:27,146
~ Why haven't you told me? ~
Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

1806
01:26:36,573 --> 01:26:40,076
This is the girl!

1807
01:26:43,663 --> 01:26:48,250
Excellent choice, Adam.

1808
01:26:57,426 --> 01:27:00,553
Oh... my goodness.

1809
01:27:08,895 --> 01:27:11,022
I have to be somewhere.

1810
01:27:11,272 --> 01:27:14,358
I promised a friend.

1811
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:18,279
I'm sorry. I must go...

1812
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:45,054
It should be around here...

1813
01:27:45,304 --> 01:27:47,639
2590... That's it.

1814
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:49,391
Up there!

1815
01:27:49,642 --> 01:27:53,604
- Does it look familiar?
- No.

1816
01:27:59,943 --> 01:28:02,236
- Don't stop!
-What is it? What do you see?!

1817
01:28:02,487 --> 01:28:06,824
- Those men in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?!

1818
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:08,242
No... but...
-Keep going.

1819
01:28:08,493 --> 01:28:11,912
Go around to the back.

1820
01:28:59,624 --> 01:29:03,085
Selwyn... number 12.

1821
01:29:25,357 --> 01:29:28,776
Now, you've got me scared.

1822
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:57,137
See, I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of!

1823
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:01,488
Betty wait... wait

1824
01:31:02,615 --> 01:31:05,534
Oh no... don't.

1825
01:31:30,016 --> 01:31:31,600
No one's home.

1826
01:31:31,851 --> 01:31:35,145
Yes?

1827
01:31:39,859 --> 01:31:43,695
Number 17.

1828
01:31:43,737 --> 01:31:46,906
But it said number 12.

1829
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:51,911
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

1830
01:31:52,162 --> 01:31:55,498
It's down in the end on the left.

1831
01:31:59,043 --> 01:32:02,796
She hasn't been around for a few days...

1832
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,260
- Oh... we'll leave her a note.
- I'll go with you.

1833
01:32:10,262 --> 01:32:13,723
She's still got some of my stuff.

1834
01:32:18,145 --> 01:32:21,731
You go ahead.
I've got to get that.

1835
01:32:36,037 --> 01:32:38,164
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

1836
01:32:38,414 --> 01:32:41,875
Guess I'm not.

1837
01:33:17,367 --> 01:33:20,870
Still no one's home I guess.

1838
01:33:49,106 --> 01:33:50,565
C'mon do it.

1839
01:33:50,816 --> 01:33:53,526
C'mon help me in. Come on.

1840
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:57,196
I'll open the front door.

1841
01:34:02,785 --> 01:34:05,871
C'mon.

1842
01:36:36,222 --> 01:36:39,641
I know what you're doing.

1843
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:02,829
I know what you have to do,

1844
01:37:04,456 --> 01:37:07,917
but let me do it.

1845
01:37:15,467 --> 01:37:18,928
Let me do it.

1846
01:37:40,991 --> 01:37:44,494
You look like someone else.

1847
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:07,432
Good night, Betty.

1848
01:38:07,683 --> 01:38:09,476
You don't wear it in the house.

1849
01:38:09,726 --> 01:38:11,602
What?

1850
01:38:11,853 --> 01:38:14,605
The wig.

1851
01:38:14,856 --> 01:38:17,983
Just I'm looking at myself again...

1852
01:38:18,234 --> 01:38:19,943
I'll take it off to sleep.

1853
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:22,405
And you don't have to sleep on that couch.

1854
01:38:22,655 --> 01:38:24,656
No, it's okay.

1855
01:38:24,907 --> 01:38:27,826
No it's not.
This is a huge bed.

1856
01:38:28,077 --> 01:38:31,622
C'mon, just get in and get a good night sleep.

1857
01:39:02,443 --> 01:39:06,113
It's more confortable than the couch, isn't it?

1858
01:39:06,363 --> 01:39:09,199
Yes.

1859
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:17,874
Thank you, Betty.

1860
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:19,917
It's nothing.

1861
01:39:20,168 --> 01:39:22,295
I shouldn't have let you sleep
on the couch last night.

1862
01:39:22,545 --> 01:39:25,089
No... I mean...

1863
01:39:25,339 --> 01:39:29,718
Thank you for everything.

1864
01:39:31,554 --> 01:39:34,973
You're welcome.

1865
01:39:43,648 --> 01:39:47,109
Good night, sweet Betty.

1866
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:58,787
Good night.

1867
01:40:39,493 --> 01:40:43,288
Have you ever done this before?

1868
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,748
I don't known!

1869
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:49,126
Have you?

1870
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:05,267
I want to with you...

1871
01:41:30,124 --> 01:41:33,835
I'm in love with you.

1872
01:41:47,223 --> 01:41:50,934
I'm in love with you.

1873
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:19,462
Silencio.

1874
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:23,215
Silencio.

1875
01:42:23,716 --> 01:42:26,677
Silencio.

1876
01:42:27,595 --> 01:42:30,722
No hay banda.

1877
01:42:31,306 --> 01:42:34,559
No hay banda.

1878
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:37,854
No hay orquestra.

1879
01:42:38,855 --> 01:42:41,982
Silencio.

1880
01:42:41,274 --> 01:42:48,322
Silencio.

1881
01:42:43,067 --> 01:42:41,024
Silencio.

1882
01:42:49,282 --> 01:42:52,118
Silencio.

1883
01:42:52,952 --> 01:42:55,788
Silencio.

1884
01:42:56,747 --> 01:42:59,207
Rita?
- No hay banda.

1885
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:02,544
Rita, wake up

1886
01:43:03,837 --> 01:43:07,548
- No, no...
- It's ok, it's ok.

1887
01:43:07,799 --> 01:43:10,551
No it's not ok.

1888
01:43:10,802 --> 01:43:13,679
What's wrong?

1889
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:17,391
Go with me somewhere...

1890
01:43:18,226 --> 01:43:23,689
It's 2 o'clock
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

1891
01:43:25,107 --> 01:43:28,276
Go with me somewhere...

1892
01:43:28,527 --> 01:43:33,615
Sure. Now?

1893
01:43:33,824 --> 01:43:38,036
Right now!

1894
01:45:10,206 --> 01:45:13,584
No hay banda!

1895
01:45:13,835 --> 01:45:17,338
There is no band!

1896
01:45:17,588 --> 01:45:21,508
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

1897
01:45:21,759 --> 01:45:24,344
This is all...

1898
01:45:24,595 --> 01:45:27,264
a tape-recording.

1899
01:45:27,514 --> 01:45:28,514
No hay banda!

1900
01:45:28,765 --> 01:45:33,936
and yet
we hear a band.

1901
01:45:34,062 --> 01:45:37,481
If we want to hear a clarinette...

1902
01:45:37,732 --> 01:45:40,234
listen...

1903
01:45:45,656 --> 01:45:50,952
Un trombon "?coulisse".

1904
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:57,625
Un trombon "con sordina".

1905
01:45:57,751 --> 01:46:04,715
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

1906
01:46:07,343 --> 01:46:10,137
Hear le son...

1907
01:46:10,346 --> 01:46:15,309
and mute it... drop it...

1908
01:46:31,825 --> 01:46:35,995
It's all recorded.

1909
01:46:37,205 --> 01:46:41,625
No hay banda!

1910
01:46:41,667 --> 01:46:46,588
It's all a tape.

1911
01:46:55,722 --> 01:46:58,558
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

1912
01:46:58,809 --> 01:47:01,102
It is...

1913
01:47:01,353 --> 01:47:04,898
an illusion.

1914
01:47:08,067 --> 01:47:11,028
Listen...

1915
01:48:24,181 --> 01:48:26,433
Senoras y senores...

1916
01:48:26,683 --> 01:48:32,813
el club Silencio les presenta
la llorona de Los Angeles:

1917
01:48:33,064 --> 01:48:37,484
Rebekah del Rio.

1918
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:19,041
Betty?

1919
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,838
Betty?

1920
01:53:35,307 --> 01:53:38,935
Donde estas?

1921
01:53:51,031 --> 01:53:53,491
Betty?

1922
01:56:20,922 --> 01:56:24,049
Hey, pretty little girl...

1923
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,761
time to wake up.

1924
01:58:03,185 --> 01:58:06,688
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

1925
01:58:06,939 --> 01:58:10,525
My lamp and dishes...

1926
01:58:11,651 --> 01:58:15,529
C'mon Diane,
it's been three weeks.

1927
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:20,701
I put your dishes in that box.

1928
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:44,182
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

1929
01:58:55,401 --> 01:58:56,360
Anytime...

1930
01:58:56,610 --> 01:59:00,738
I'm just making sure, Diane.

1931
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:12,792
- That is it?
- Yeah

1932
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,676
Ah, by the way, those two detectives
came by again, looking for you.

1933
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:16,519
Camilla!

1934
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:22,107
You've come back!

1935
02:02:02,786 --> 02:02:06,080
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

1936
02:02:06,331 --> 02:02:08,458
I said:

1937
02:02:08,708 --> 02:02:12,169
You drive me wild.

1938
02:02:23,889 --> 02:02:27,350
We shouldn't do this anymore...

1939
02:02:32,731 --> 02:02:35,858
Don't say that...

1940
02:02:39,904 --> 02:02:42,614
Don't ever say that!

1941
02:02:42,865 --> 02:02:44,783
Don't Diane,

1942
02:02:45,034 --> 02:02:48,912
Stop it...
Diane STOP!

1943
02:02:49,163 --> 02:02:53,083
I've tried to tell you this before.

1944
02:03:00,757 --> 02:03:04,510
It's him, isn't it?

1945
02:03:14,437 --> 02:03:16,605
I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene.

1946
02:03:16,856 --> 02:03:19,274
Just watch me...

1947
02:03:19,525 --> 02:03:23,153
and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

1948
02:03:26,532 --> 02:03:28,700
Don't seat so rigid...

1949
02:03:28,951 --> 02:03:32,204
just, just relax...

1950
02:03:32,454 --> 02:03:34,330
You two are here alone...

1951
02:03:34,581 --> 02:03:38,167
and it's real comfortable...

1952
02:03:38,293 --> 02:03:40,878
like you've known each other forever...

1953
02:03:41,129 --> 02:03:45,341
ven if you don't say anything...
It's real comfortable.

1954
02:03:46,217 --> 02:03:47,968
Hank, can you just clear the set...

1955
02:03:48,219 --> 02:03:50,721
there's too many people around here...
Let's get this worked out...

1956
02:03:50,971 --> 02:03:53,306
Clear the set!
Clear the set!

1957
02:03:53,557 --> 02:03:56,267
Everyone get another cup of coffee.

1958
02:03:56,518 --> 02:03:59,687
- Everyone please!
- Can Diane stay?

1959
02:03:59,938 --> 02:04:05,985
Yes, true. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

1960
02:04:10,823 --> 02:04:12,574
Now when she starts to cry...

1961
02:04:12,825 --> 02:04:16,286
don't pull her toward you.

1962
02:04:16,495 --> 02:04:19,497
Let her fall in to you...

1963
02:04:19,749 --> 02:04:23,210
Let her fall.

1964
02:04:25,212 --> 02:04:28,673
When you kiss her...

1965
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:33,177
It's just a continuation of that move

1966
02:04:33,929 --> 02:04:36,973
There is no break...

1967
02:05:01,496 --> 02:05:04,582
Kill the lights!

1968
02:05:13,382 --> 02:05:14,633
Don't be mad!

1969
02:05:14,884 --> 02:05:18,053
- Don't make it be like this!
- Oh, sure.

1970
02:05:18,304 --> 02:05:20,848
You want me to make this easy for you? No!

1971
02:05:21,098 --> 02:05:24,184
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

1972
02:05:24,435 --> 02:05:28,438
It's not easy for me!!!

1973
02:06:51,141 --> 02:06:52,725
Hello, it's me...

1974
02:06:52,976 --> 02:06:56,062
leave a message...

1975
02:07:03,611 --> 02:07:06,530
Hello?

1976
02:07:09,659 --> 02:07:12,203
Diane, the car is waiting.

1977
02:07:12,453 --> 02:07:14,246
Are you ok?

1978
02:07:14,497 --> 02:07:17,624
You comin'?

1979
02:07:22,212 --> 02:07:23,880
Good...

1980
02:07:24,131 --> 02:07:27,050
It means so much to me.

1981
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:30,886
Go on... the car is right outside the house..

1982
02:07:31,137 --> 02:07:34,556
It's been waiting, ok ?

1983
02:07:38,186 --> 02:07:39,895
Ok.

1984
02:07:40,146 --> 02:07:44,900
It's 6980, Mulholland drive.

1985
02:07:45,151 --> 02:07:48,570
Mulholland drive.

1986
02:08:56,843 --> 02:09:01,514
What are you doing?
We don't stop here...

1987
02:09:04,767 --> 02:09:08,645
A surprise...

1988
02:09:29,916 --> 02:09:33,335
Shortcut.

1989
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:37,006
C'mon sweetheart.

1990
02:09:41,969 --> 02:09:43,929
It's beautiful.

1991
02:09:44,179 --> 02:09:47,640
A secret path.

1992
02:10:54,329 --> 02:10:56,831
Ah, perfect timing!

1993
02:10:57,248 --> 02:11:00,417
Welcome, Diane.

1994
02:11:05,089 --> 02:11:07,132
Well...

1995
02:11:07,383 --> 02:11:10,969
Here's to love...

1996
02:11:19,102 --> 02:11:21,896
Here's to love...

1997
02:11:25,859 --> 02:11:29,195
Ah, here she is...

1998
02:11:37,244 --> 02:11:40,789
I don't believe you met my mother...

1999
02:11:40,915 --> 02:11:43,167
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

2000
02:11:43,417 --> 02:11:45,961
Just call me Coco, everybody does...

2001
02:11:46,211 --> 02:11:48,338
- Pleased to meet you...
- Let's eat...

2002
02:11:48,588 --> 02:11:51,715
I'm starving...

2003
02:11:56,888 --> 02:12:00,516
I'm sorry, I was late.

2004
02:12:19,367 --> 02:12:22,411
I'm from Deep River, Ontario...

2005
02:12:22,662 --> 02:12:24,413
a small town.

2006
02:12:24,664 --> 02:12:29,043
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

2007
02:12:29,293 --> 02:12:32,754
I've always wanted to come here.

2008
02:12:32,964 --> 02:12:36,425
I won this ballet contest...

2009
02:12:36,675 --> 02:12:40,053
that sort of led to acting...

2010
02:12:40,471 --> 02:12:44,391
you know, wanting to act.

2011
02:12:44,558 --> 02:12:48,019
When my aunt died...

2012
02:12:48,270 --> 02:12:52,732
anyway, she left me so money...
she worked here...

2013
02:12:52,982 --> 02:12:55,567
In the movies?

2014
02:12:55,818 --> 02:12:58,153
Yes.

2015
02:12:58,404 --> 02:13:02,407
How did you meet Camilla?

2016
02:13:02,658 --> 02:13:04,743
On a "Sylvia North Story".

2017
02:13:04,994 --> 02:13:08,413
Camilla was great in that.

2018
02:13:22,177 --> 02:13:26,264
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

2019
02:13:26,514 --> 02:13:30,517
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

2020
02:13:32,436 --> 02:13:34,813
The director...

2021
02:13:35,064 --> 02:13:37,149
Bob Brooker?

2022
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:40,276
Yes.

2023
02:13:41,570 --> 02:13:45,031
Hadn't so much of me...

2024
02:13:48,702 --> 02:13:52,538
anyway, that's when we became friends.

2025
02:13:52,789 --> 02:13:54,540
She helped me...

2026
02:13:54,791 --> 02:13:59,837
getting some parts
in some of her films.

2027
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:03,340
I see.

2028
02:14:16,895 --> 02:14:19,480
So, I got the pool...

2029
02:14:19,731 --> 02:14:23,276
and she got the pool-man.

2030
02:14:23,943 --> 02:14:29,531
I couldn't believe it
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

2031
02:14:34,912 --> 02:14:38,373
Sometimes good things happen.

2032
02:15:30,965 --> 02:15:34,760
So, I guess we saved the best for last...

2033
02:15:36,762 --> 02:15:38,013
Do you want to tell them?

2034
02:15:38,263 --> 02:15:41,682
No, you to tell them.

2035
02:15:44,436 --> 02:15:47,855
Camilla and I...

2036
02:15:58,991 --> 02:16:02,410
are going to be...

2037
02:16:12,838 --> 02:16:15,924
Sorry about that.

2038
02:16:23,014 --> 02:16:26,100
No, I'm fine.

2039
02:16:30,688 --> 02:16:34,274
This is the girl.

2040
02:16:34,525 --> 02:16:37,861
Don't show me this photothing here.

2041
02:16:38,111 --> 02:16:42,573
It's just an actress' photo, everybody's got one.

2042
02:16:42,824 --> 02:16:45,284
You got the money?

2043
02:16:45,535 --> 02:16:48,662
Sure do.

2044
02:16:58,672 --> 02:17:04,302
Ok, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.

2045
02:17:05,721 --> 02:17:10,016
Are you sure you want this?

2046
02:17:13,436 --> 02:17:17,064
More than anything in this world.

2047
02:17:26,907 --> 02:17:30,410
When it's finished, you'll find this where i told you.

2048
02:17:44,132 --> 02:17:47,468
What's it open?

2049
02:22:11,885 --> 02:22:15,721
Silencio
