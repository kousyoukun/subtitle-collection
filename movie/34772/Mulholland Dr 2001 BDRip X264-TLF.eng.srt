1
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:28,956
MULHOLLAND DR.

2
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,373
What are you doing?
We don't stop here!

3
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:13,748
Get out of the car.

4
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,164
The boys found this...

5
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:56,831
on the floor in back
of the Caddy.

6
00:08:57,081 --> 00:09:00,956
Yeah, they showed me.

7
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,664
Could be unrelated.

8
00:09:03,914 --> 00:09:06,289
Could be.

9
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:11,248
Any of those dead kids wearin'
pearl earrings?

10
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:16,914
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.

11
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:20,623
That's what I'm thinkin'.

12
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:00,914
Just one more bag after that.

13
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,164
I just wanted to come here.

14
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:51,039
To Winkie's?

15
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:54,331
This Winkie's.

16
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,039
Okay.
Why this Winkie's?

17
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,831
It's kind of embarrassing...

18
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:09,331
Go ahead.

19
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:11,164
I had a dream about this place.

20
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,831
Oh boy.

21
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:16,539
You see what I mean?

22
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:21,789
Okay, so you had a dream about this place.

23
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:24,998
Tell me.

24
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,539
Well...

25
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:32,831
it's the second one I've had...

26
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,498
but they are both the same...

27
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,831
they start out that I'm in here but...

28
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:43,081
it's not day or night.

29
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,373
It's kinda half night, you know?...

30
00:12:46,623 --> 00:12:49,206
but it
looks just like this...

31
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:52,539
except for the light.

32
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,914
And I'm scared like I can't tell ya.

33
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,914
Of all people,

34
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:03,873
you're standing right over there...

35
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:10,331
by that counter.

36
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,789
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

37
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:21,373
I get even more frightened when I see
how afraid you are and...

38
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,331
then I realize what it is.

39
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,873
There's a man...

40
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:36,748
in back of this place.

41
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:41,123
He's the one who's doing it.

42
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:44,414
I can see him through the wall.

43
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:48,123
I can see his face...

44
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,998
I hope that I never see that face ever...

45
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:59,289
outside of the dream.

46
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,914
That's it.

47
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:11,706
So...

48
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:16,373
you came to see if it's out there?

49
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,914
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.

50
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:27,373
Right thing.

51
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,248
It's around here.

52
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:28,998
Dan? You all right?
Dan? Dan?

53
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:58,039
Hello?

54
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:03,539
The girl is still missing.

55
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:23,581
Talk to me.

56
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:27,248
The same.

57
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:07,373
Oh...
I can't believe it!

58
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,414
It's time to say goodbye, Betty.

59
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,414
It's
been so nice travelling with you.

60
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,956
Thank you, Irene.
I was so excited and nervous.

61
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,623
It was sure great to have you to talk to.

62
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,123
Remember I'll be watching for you on the big screen.

63
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,789
Okay Irene.
Won't that be the day.

64
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,998
Good luck, Betty dear.

65
00:18:56,248 --> 00:18:58,789
Take care of yourself and be careful.

66
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,164
I will. Thanks again.

67
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:02,623
Thanks again.

68
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,664
Betty, it was so nice meeting you
All the luck in the world.

69
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,206
Bye.

70
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:18,248
My bags!

71
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:21,123
Where to?

72
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,831
1612 Havenhurst.

73
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,248
Got it!

74
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:46,831
Ten bucks says you're Betty.

75
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,581
Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

76
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,581
It is Mrs. Lenoix isn't it?

77
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:54,623
Oh, in all my living glory, baby.

78
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,456
Pleased to meet you.
- Just call me Coco.

79
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:01,123
Everybody else does.
Wait there, and I'll go get the key.

80
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:04,456
OK, Coco.

81
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,206
Wilkins?!
Wilkins?!?!

82
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:14,206
If that damned dog craps in the courtyard
one more time...

83
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,706
I'm just gonna bake his little butt for breakfast.

84
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:20,123
You don't have pets do you?
- No, I don't.

85
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:23,623
They're allowed,
I just don't like 'em here... for obvious reasons.

86
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,206
You know, there was a man that lived here once...

87
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,956
that had a prize fighting kangaroo.

88
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:31,331
Well, You just wouldn't believe...

89
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,373
what that kangaroo did to this courtyard.

90
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:38,498
Let's see your Aunt's apartment
... it's a good one.

91
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:42,206
I can hardly wait!

92
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:50,081
It's unbelievable!

93
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:53,414
I told ya.
- Wow!

94
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:57,623
Well, you and your Aunt probably have an understanding,
so here's the key.

95
00:21:57,873 --> 00:22:00,414
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

96
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,914
Everybody in this building's
pretty much okay with me...

97
00:22:04,164 --> 00:22:06,581
or they wouldn't be here.

98
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,998
If you want, later on
I'll introduce you around.

99
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:14,456
No hard feelings if you don't.

100
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:42,289
Oh my! I'm sorry. My Aunt ... Ruth didn't tell
me someone was going to be here.

101
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,706
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK

102
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:47,998
I'm Ruth's niece.
My name's Betty. I'm
sure she told you I was coming.

103
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:51,748
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

104
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,748
There was an accident.

105
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,914
I came here.

106
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,581
I understand.
I saw the dress.

107
00:23:58,831 --> 00:24:02,414
Sorry. Are you all right?

108
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:05,623
What happened?

109
00:24:05,873 --> 00:24:08,289
A car...

110
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,164
a car accident.

111
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:16,206
Oh... You OK?

112
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,248
I think so.

113
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,789
I was just...

114
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,789
taking a shower.

115
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,789
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get
back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.

116
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,831
I'll let you get back to that.
I'm going to get unpacked.

117
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:37,414
What's your name?

118
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:45,373
I'm sorry. I'll get out of here
and we can talk later.

119
00:25:21,206 --> 00:25:24,081
My name's...
Rita.

120
00:25:24,331 --> 00:25:27,206
Hi...

121
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,789
do you work with my Aunt?

122
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,414
No... I...
- Sorry...

123
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:37,789
it's none of my business.

124
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,748
She has pretty red hair...

125
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,081
She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie...

126
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:46,081
that's
being made in Canada...

127
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:49,748
but I guess you already know that.

128
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,248
I couldn't afford a place
like this in a million years.

129
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:56,331
Unless of course I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

130
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:59,623
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star,

131
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:02,039
but sometimes people end up being both
and so that is,

132
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:08,289
I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here.

133
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:13,956
I'm sorry,
I'm just so excited to be here...

134
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,539
I mean I just came here from Deep River, Ontario...

135
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:19,373
now I'm in this...

136
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:21,331
dream place.

137
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,331
You can imagine how I feel.

138
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:34,873
Oh... What? Sit down...

139
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:41,331
Where were you hurt?

140
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:44,248
We should call a doctor.
- No

141
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:47,039
But, this could be serious.
- No, I...

142
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:48,873
I need to sleep.

143
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:51,164
If you have a concussion
you shouldn't sleep.

144
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:53,956
It will feel okay if I sleep.

145
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:59,123
I just need to
lie down here and sleep.

146
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,789
You see Adam... there are some suggestions

147
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,998
that are to be brought forward ...

148
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:04,164
and I know you said you
would entertain suggestions

149
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:08,456
and that's all anybody here
is asking you to do.

150
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,664
What are you talking about?

151
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:13,289
An open mind...

152
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,581
You're in the process of
re-casting your lead actress and

153
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,581
I'm...

154
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:24,498
We're asking you to
keep an open mind.

155
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:37,039
What was it last time?

156
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:40,789
OK. Let's try the next one.

157
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,331
He's not gonna like it.

158
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:46,664
We'll see.

159
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,164
Ah... Castigliane brothers.

160
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:57,831
Let me introduce you around...

161
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:01,039
please ... take a seat.

162
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:03,331
this is Mr. Darby,
whom you know

163
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:06,998
and this is the director Adam Kesher...

164
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,998
and his manager Robert Smith.

165
00:29:43,206 --> 00:29:45,331
Oh,

166
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,998
She's very pretty.

167
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:54,039
May I offer you, gentlemen...
anything?

168
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:57,206
Espresso.
- Nothing.

169
00:29:57,456 --> 00:30:02,414
- What's the photo for?
- An espresso.

170
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,623
No, that's it.

171
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,914
I think you're gonna enjoy your espresso
this time.

172
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:10,664
I've done quite a bit of a research
knowing how hard you are to please.

173
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:13,331
This one comes highly recommended.

174
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,456
What's the photo for?

175
00:30:16,706 --> 00:30:18,706
It's a recommendation...

176
00:30:18,956 --> 00:30:22,873
a recommendation to you, Adam,

177
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:26,873
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

178
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:30,748
What girl?. For what?.
What is this, Ray?.

179
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:35,248
We'd be happy to put her
on the list for consideration.

180
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:40,706
You'd be pleased to know
there's quite a lot of interest in this role.

181
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,248
Interest?. No.

182
00:30:43,498 --> 00:30:46,039
There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

183
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:47,706
This is the girl.

184
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:50,873
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, Adam.

185
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:52,873
Hold on?.

186
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:57,039
There's no way.
There's no way!

187
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:13,373
Napkin.

188
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:16,831
- Pardon?
- Napkin.

189
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:19,539
Of course.

190
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,206
Excuse me.

191
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:41,831
Is that all sir?.

192
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,248
Shit.

193
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,914
Sorry!
That was a highly recommended...

194
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,414
That's considered one of the finest
espressos in the world, Sir.

195
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:47,164
What's going on here?
There's no way that girl is in my movie.

196
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:50,664
HELP ME!!!

197
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:52,373
This is the girl.

198
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:57,581
Hey!
That girl is not in my film!

199
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:02,831
It's no longer your film.

200
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:09,789
This is the girl.

201
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:50,664
Did the Castigliane brothers get out of
that limo?

202
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,914
- They two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

203
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,289
- Yes.
- Keep that door open.

204
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:07,873
Castigliane brothers?

205
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:11,539
Beat it, pal.

206
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:57,914
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

207
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:02,706
Her name's Camilla Rhodes.

208
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:07,498
The director doesn't want her.

209
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:13,373
Do you want him replaced?.

210
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:17,748
I know they said...

211
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:20,623
Then?

212
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,039
Then...

213
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:26,706
that means we should...

214
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,831
Yes?.

215
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,831
Shut everything down ...

216
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:37,414
Is that something that...

217
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,914
do you want us...

218
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:43,623
to shut everything down?

219
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:51,831
Then we'll shut everything down.

220
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:23,081
Oh man, that's unheard of ...

221
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:27,956
an accident like that ...
who could have foreseen that?

222
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,581
- That's unreal, right?

223
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,331
Hell, right.

224
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:37,206
Unbelievable.

225
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:44,539
So, bro, God you're good!

226
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,539
What have you been doin'?

227
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:49,998
Just doin' some stuff
for this guy.

228
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:53,123
Yeah?. Making ends meet, huh?

229
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:56,956
Hardly.

230
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,498
I know, man.

231
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,623
Look at my digs.

232
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:04,956
Times are tough, bro.

233
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:09,331
Hey, man,
it's not that bad.

234
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:11,331
I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.

235
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,373
It was just a thing.

236
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:15,373
The story made you laugh.

237
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:20,581
- It was a funny story.
- Fucking car accident.

238
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:25,664
It's it?...

239
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:29,748
It's the famous black book.

240
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:36,706
The history of the world
in phone numbers.

241
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:09,248
Oh, man!.

242
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,831
Something bit me
BAD!

243
00:38:57,748 --> 00:39:00,706
God!

244
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:13,998
Hey man!

245
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:18,706
She's hurt bad! Could you come here
and call on the phone. Please I need you!

246
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:23,498
She's hurt bad!
You gotta call the hospital

247
00:39:23,748 --> 00:39:25,498
Come on man!
I'm serious about this!

248
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:29,831
I can't do everything by myself!

249
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:51,956
Hey man!.

250
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:35,456
OH!

251
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,498
...okay Aunt Ruth... I'll try.

252
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:57,748
I'm gonna study those lines
until I know them inside out.

253
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,956
Yep, either here
on this fabulous leather couch...

254
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:02,956
or I'll take them with a coffee in the courtyard...

255
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,831
like a regular movie star.

256
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:08,373
Oh! I got a real
shock to find your friend Rita here.

257
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:13,206
She was in the shower and I opened the
door ...

258
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:17,039
... what do you mean?

259
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:20,331
... She was in an accident.

260
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:24,748
... Rita, your friend.

261
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:28,748
No, Coco unlocked the door.

262
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,748
... No, she didn't see her.

263
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:34,873
... She's sleeping.

264
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:36,831
I'm sure there's some explanation for this
Aunt Ruth,

265
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:40,831
I don't think we have to do that.

266
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:47,123
Please don't worry...
we don't need the police.

267
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:02,039
You're awake...

268
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:06,831
I think I misunderstood.

269
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:10,498
I thought you knew my Aunt and
that's why you were here.

270
00:42:10,748 --> 00:42:15,873
I just talked to my Aunt on the phone and she wants me
to call the police.

271
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,373
I'm... sorry. I ...

272
00:42:28,623 --> 00:42:32,081
What is it Rita?

273
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:36,664
I thought when I woke up...

274
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:39,498
I thought sleep would do it...

275
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:42,623
What's wrong?

276
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:46,123
I don't know who I am.

277
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:48,331
What do you mean?
You're Rita.

278
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:52,664
I'm not. I don't know what my name is.

279
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:57,331
I don't know who I am!!

280
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:11,539
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

281
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:15,123
You want to know, don't you?

282
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:19,081
I ... yes, but ... I ...
- Open it!

283
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:56,164
You sure you don't want anything?
- Not here...no thanks.

284
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:59,039
Not a coke or something?

285
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:00,789
No... thanks though...

286
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:05,248
I'll take a
cigarette if you have one.

287
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:10,748
Sure, reach inside my shirt pocket there.

288
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:17,873
Any new girls on the street lately?

289
00:45:20,873 --> 00:45:24,289
No.  I haven't seen any.

290
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,289
A brunette?

291
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:29,956
... maybe a little beat up?

292
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,414
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't
you baby?

293
00:45:37,664 --> 00:45:42,414
- Sure.
- You bet you will.

294
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:47,373
That money.

295
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:52,998
You don't know where it came from?

296
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:59,373
When you think of them...
the money... the key...

297
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:04,248
does it make you remember anything?

298
00:46:04,664 --> 00:46:08,706
something ...

299
00:46:08,706 --> 00:46:12,914
...something there is.

300
00:46:23,706 --> 00:46:25,289
What did you say?

301
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:27,456
They fired everyone.

302
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:29,748
Who fired everyone?

303
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:34,123
Ray did!
Please I'm talking on the phone,

304
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:37,289
and then they closed the set...
everybody's gone.

305
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:40,956
You'd better
get down here Adam!

306
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:44,873
You've got to talk to Ray
you've got to fix this.

307
00:46:45,123 --> 00:46:46,581
I'm going home.

308
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,123
Home?!

309
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,123
Meet me at the office.
We've got to do something...

310
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:52,123
... you've got to do something Adam!

311
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,289
I'm going home, Cynthia.

312
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,373
Adam, this isn't like you.

313
00:46:56,623 --> 00:46:58,039
Please come to the office.

314
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,414
- There must be something we can do.
- I'm going home.

315
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:15,789
I wonder where you were going.

316
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:22,831
Mulholland drive.

317
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:29,706
Mulholland drive?

318
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:32,456
That's where I was going...

319
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:36,706
Mulholland Drive.

320
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:40,623
Maybe that's where the accident was.

321
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:44,373
There must be a police report.
We could call...

322
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:46,373
We could call anonymously from a pay phone...

323
00:47:46,623 --> 00:47:49,539
just to see if there was an accident.

324
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:52,206
Come on. It'll be just like in the movies.

325
00:47:52,456 --> 00:47:56,414
We'll pretend to be someone else.

326
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:58,498
I want to walk around anyway.

327
00:47:58,748 --> 00:48:01,956
I'm
in Hollywood and I haven't even seen any of it.

328
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:06,664
Come on Rita.
Do you feel up to it?

329
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:18,206
Okay... but just

330
00:48:18,706 --> 00:48:20,998
...just to see.

331
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:25,248
Just to see
if there was an accident...

332
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:29,456
on Mulholland Drive.

333
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:13,289
Lorraine?

334
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:16,998
Lorraine... you home?

335
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:19,748
Lorraine...

336
00:49:40,831 --> 00:49:44,248
Now, you've done it!

337
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:49,873
Just forget you ever saw.
It's better that way.

338
00:49:51,081 --> 00:49:55,664
What the hell are you even doing here?

339
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:10,164
What are you doing?

340
00:50:11,581 --> 00:50:14,539
THAT'S MY JEWELRY!!!

341
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:33,581
That bastard
You bastard!

342
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,498
He's probably upset Lorraine.

343
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,998
WHAT.. ARE ... YOU ... DOING!!!???

344
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,123
STOP IT!!!
STOP IT!!!

345
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:51,414
Adam, STOP IT!!!

346
00:50:51,664 --> 00:50:54,789
STOP IT!!!
STOP IT!!!

347
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,456
Adam, STOP IT!!!

348
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:05,289
What're you doin'
You're hurting me!

349
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:12,623
That's not a way to treat your wife, buddy.
I don't care what she's done.

350
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:15,789
Throw him out!

351
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:23,081
Throw him out!

352
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:31,873
Get out!

353
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:13,123
Let's hide it.

354
00:52:56,831 --> 00:53:00,289
There's one.

355
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,373
Hollywood Police Department

356
00:53:16,623 --> 00:53:20,123
I'm inquiring about an accident that
happened last night on Mulholland Drive.

357
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:24,248
Hold please.
I'll connect you to traffic.

358
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:29,748
- Sergeant Baxter,
- Hi. I'm inquiring...

359
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,456
well, I heard a sound last night
that sounded sort of like a carcrash and

360
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:37,581
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

361
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,581
Yes, there was.

362
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:42,706
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No. I can't.

363
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:47,248
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name please?

364
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:54,748
There was an accident.

365
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,789
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident Rita.

366
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,498
I just know it was.

367
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:02,914
Maybe there's something about it in the papers.

368
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:06,914
Come on we'll buy a cup of coffee
and we can see.

369
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:13,081
Maybe it happened so late it's not going
to be in today's paper.

370
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:16,789
There's nothing?

371
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:20,414
Not that I can see.

372
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:23,748
That's Ok.

373
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:27,623
Thanks...

374
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:32,623
... Diane.

375
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,248
That'd be all?
You want your check?

376
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:42,831
Rita, you want something?

377
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:50,081
- No. Just the coffee.
- I'll take our check.

378
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:59,373
What is it Rita?
-Shhhh.

379
00:55:05,914 --> 00:55:09,373
I remember something...

380
00:55:13,623 --> 00:55:16,914
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

381
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:21,123
Maybe that's my name.

382
00:55:24,956 --> 00:55:28,831
D.Selwyn ... it's the only one.

383
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:32,539
I'm gonna call.

384
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:40,414
It's strange to be calling yourself.

385
00:55:40,664 --> 00:55:44,123
Maybe it's not me.

386
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,164
Hello... this is me.

387
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:56,789
Leave me a message.

388
00:55:57,581 --> 00:56:00,831
It's not my voice...

389
00:56:01,081 --> 00:56:04,539
but I know her.

390
00:56:04,956 --> 00:56:08,289
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's voice.

391
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:10,581
Maybe that's your roommate...

392
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:13,039
or if it is Diane Selwyn...

393
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:16,331
she can tell you who you are.

394
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:22,248
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.

395
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:04,081
- Yeah, right ... get lost!
- Is this Adam Kesher's house?

396
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:05,873
Like hell it is! Get out ... NOW!!

397
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:09,206
Get out!

398
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:21,539
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

399
00:57:22,914 --> 00:57:25,039
I guess you don't understand English.
She said to leave.

400
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:28,039
Here's the door.

401
00:57:28,289 --> 00:57:32,414
OUT!

402
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:03,498
- Yeah...what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry Mr. Kesher...

403
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:07,581
but there seems tobe some problem
with your credit cards.

404
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:12,081
What??... I pay you cash, Cookie.

405
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:17,206
Fact is two guys from your bank came by.

406
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,873
My bank?

407
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:24,331
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

408
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:25,623
What did they say?

409
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:30,164
I'm afraid they said
you're maxed out at your bank...

410
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:35,206
and your line of credit has been cancelled.

411
00:58:35,414 --> 00:58:38,789
It's unbelievable.

412
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:42,164
Look...

413
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:46,081
I don't know what's going on.

414
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:49,789
That's so much baloney.

415
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:52,831
I've got enough cash for you Cookie.

416
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:55,164
I known... I known...

417
00:58:55,414 --> 00:58:57,164
Don't worry...

418
00:58:57,456 --> 00:59:00,081
I'm sorry.

419
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:03,706
It was my duty to inform you.

420
00:59:06,164 --> 00:59:11,873
People you're hiding from,
they know where you are.

421
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:15,123
Right.

422
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:18,289
I'm sorry

423
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:41,581
Hello?

424
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:43,623
Someone's maybe shut off my money!

425
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,623
I know.
Where are you Adam?

426
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,914
What do you mean you know?

427
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:49,914
Somebody called. When they couldn't get you...

428
00:59:50,164 --> 00:59:52,331
they told me you were as good as broke.

429
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:54,623
I didn't believe them,
so I made a few calls.

430
00:59:54,873 --> 00:59:57,039
- And?
- You're broke!

431
00:59:57,289 --> 00:59:58,664
But I'm not broke!

432
00:59:58,914 --> 01:00:03,164
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

433
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:05,706
I'm at Cookie's Downtown.

434
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:10,373
Do you know somebody called the "The Cowboy"?

435
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,748
- "The Cowboy"?
- Yes

436
01:00:12,998 --> 01:00:14,456
Yeah, the Cowboy.

437
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:17,581
This guy, the Cowboy,
wants to see you.

438
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:21,706
Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.

439
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:25,039
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea
for me to go to see the Cowboy.

440
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:28,414
Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?

441
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:33,164
Listen. Something tells me this guy is connected
to what's happening,

442
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:37,081
and I think you should do it and I think you should
do it right away.

443
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:39,081
What's going on, Cynthia?

444
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:43,248
It's been a very strange day...

445
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:47,039
and getting stranger.

446
01:00:47,914 --> 01:00:51,831
Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean...
do I have to ride out to the range?

447
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,123
Sort of, funny boy.

448
01:00:54,373 --> 01:00:56,206
If I tell him the
meeting's on...

449
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:59,081
you have to go to the top of
Beachwood Canyon.

450
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:03,164
There's a corral up there where he'll be.

451
01:01:03,414 --> 01:01:05,873
You've got to be kidding me!

452
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:08,289
Will you meet with him?

453
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,581
Yeah, sure.

454
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:13,956
It's been that kind of a day.
When?

455
01:01:14,206 --> 01:01:16,123
I'll call him, right away...

456
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,873
then I'll call you back.

457
01:01:19,123 --> 01:01:24,039
You could stay at my place, if you want it.

458
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:26,248
Cynthia... I don't think it'll be a good idea.

459
01:01:26,498 --> 01:01:28,581
I'm just offering a place to stay.

460
01:01:28,831 --> 01:01:31,873
And I appreciate the offer, Cynthia.
I'll find a place.

461
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:35,331
Now go on and give the Cowboy a yodel
and get back to me.

462
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:39,081
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.

463
01:01:39,331 --> 01:01:44,123
Just get along little dowgie and call me back.

464
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:56,748
It's right about here on Sierra Bonita.

465
01:01:56,998 --> 01:01:59,831
That's not too far away.

466
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:02,873
What's wrong with that?

467
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:06,581
I'm not sure about this.

468
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,248
I know you're afraid of something.

469
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:14,164
We'll be careful. Promise.

470
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:17,664
Tomorrow we'll go over there...

471
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:21,456
and we'll find out.

472
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:36,289
It'll be okay.

473
01:02:37,664 --> 01:02:41,123
It's probabily Coco

474
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:44,331
Yes?

475
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:45,748
May I help you?

476
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:49,623
Someone is in trouble.

477
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:52,623
Who are you?

478
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:55,539
What are you doing in Ruth's apartment?

479
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:57,706
She's letting me stay here.

480
01:02:57,956 --> 01:03:00,373
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

481
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:02,164
No it's not.

482
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:04,831
That's not what she said.

483
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:09,581
Someone is in trouble.
Something bad is happening!

484
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:13,164
I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are
and...

485
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:17,873
Louise...
What are you doing Louise?

486
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:22,039
Oh, Coco! I've been
trying to find you all afternoon since
3:00 o'clock.

487
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:25,456
That one is in my room
and she won't leave.

488
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:29,373
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

489
01:03:29,623 --> 01:03:32,206
This is Louise Bonner. I'm sure she
meant well.

490
01:03:32,456 --> 01:03:36,373
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

491
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:39,498
In fact and
fortunately I was just on my way here to see Betty.

492
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:42,289
Betty's a young actress and I was just delivering...

493
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:45,706
some faxed pages of a scene
for a big audition tomorrow.

494
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,539
- Well, here they are honey.
- Oh, thank you.

495
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:51,206
Now come along Louise
and I'll take you home.

496
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:54,164
I'm sorry. It happens sometimes.
Come on.

497
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,748
No, she said it was someone else
who was in trouble.

498
01:03:56,998 --> 01:03:59,914
Stop it, Louise. I'm taking you home...

499
01:04:00,164 --> 01:04:01,998
Come on.

500
01:04:02,248 --> 01:04:04,831
- Goodnight Betty.
- Goodnight.

501
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:08,164
Goodnight.

502
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:49,081
Cowboy!

503
01:05:55,998 --> 01:06:00,164
- Howdy!
- Howdy to you.

504
01:06:00,914 --> 01:06:04,039
Beautiful evening.

505
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,373
Sure want to thank ya for coming
all theway up to see me...

506
01:06:09,623 --> 01:06:14,289
from that nice hotel Downtown.

507
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:17,248
No problem.
What's on your mind?.

508
01:06:17,498 --> 01:06:21,831
Well now, here's a man who wants to get
right down to it.

509
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:24,664
Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?

510
01:06:24,956 --> 01:06:27,873
Whatever.

511
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:30,748
A man's attitude...

512
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,623
... a man's attitude
goes some ways

513
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:36,498
the way his life will be.

514
01:06:36,748 --> 01:06:39,831
Is that somethin' you might agree with?

515
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:41,706
Sure.

516
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:45,623
Now... did you answer because you thought
that's what I wanted to hear...

517
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:47,914
or did you think about what I said...

518
01:06:48,164 --> 01:06:53,123
and answer cause you
truly believe that to be right?

519
01:06:53,373 --> 01:06:58,914
I agree with what you said... truly.

520
01:06:59,164 --> 01:07:02,623
What did I say?

521
01:07:03,914 --> 01:07:09,164
That a man's attitude determines to a
large extent how his life will be.

522
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:11,706
So since you agree...

523
01:07:11,956 --> 01:07:16,789
you must be a person who does not care about the good life.

524
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,748
How's that?

525
01:07:20,831 --> 01:07:24,664
Well, stop for a little second and
think about it.

526
01:07:24,914 --> 01:07:28,664
Can you do that for me?

527
01:07:29,539 --> 01:07:34,081
Okay, I'm thinking.

528
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:37,873
No. You're not thinkin'

529
01:07:38,123 --> 01:07:42,248
You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'.

530
01:07:42,498 --> 01:07:46,623
Now I want ya to think
and stop bein' a smart aleck.

531
01:07:46,873 --> 01:07:49,039
Can you try that for me?

532
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:53,831
Look ... where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

533
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:56,498
There's sometimes a buggy.

534
01:07:56,748 --> 01:07:59,873
How many drivers does a buggy have?

535
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:01,873
One.

536
01:08:02,123 --> 01:08:05,164
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy...

537
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:10,164
and you if fix your attitude you can
ride along with me.

538
01:08:10,581 --> 01:08:11,706
Okay.

539
01:08:11,956 --> 01:08:15,748
I want you to go back to work tomorrow.

540
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:18,289
You were re-casting the lead
actress anyway...

541
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:22,456
audition many girls for
the part.

542
01:08:22,706 --> 01:08:27,498
When you see the girl that was
shown to you earlier today, you will say:

543
01:08:27,748 --> 01:08:30,873
This is the girl.

544
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:33,456
The rest of the cast can stay.

545
01:08:33,706 --> 01:08:36,164
That is up to you.

546
01:08:36,414 --> 01:08:40,789
But that lead girl is not up to you.

547
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:43,998
Now, you will see me one more time...

548
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:46,664
if you do good.

549
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:49,789
You will see me two more times...

550
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:52,206
if you do bad.

551
01:08:52,456 --> 01:08:55,581
Good night.

552
01:09:19,081 --> 01:09:20,831
You're still here?

553
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:23,706
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

554
01:09:23,956 --> 01:09:26,539
Nobody wants you here!

555
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:28,456
Really?

556
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:31,164
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

557
01:09:31,414 --> 01:09:35,414
- So... surprise...
- I can call them... I can call my dad...

558
01:09:35,664 --> 01:09:37,664
But you won't...

559
01:09:37,914 --> 01:09:41,039
If you're trying to blackmail me...
it's not going to work.

560
01:09:41,289 --> 01:09:43,123
You're playing a dangerous game here.

561
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:45,539
You know what I want...
it's not that difficult.

562
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:49,164
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad ...

563
01:09:49,414 --> 01:09:52,373
he trusts you...
you're his best friend.

564
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,914
This will be the end of everything.

565
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:58,206
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

566
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:02,789
Stop! Just stop! That's what you said
from the beginning.

567
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:05,956
If I tell what happened...
they'll arrest you and put you in jail.

568
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,039
so get out of here before...

569
01:10:08,289 --> 01:10:11,623
Before what?

570
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,914
Before I kill you.

571
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:18,998
Then they'd put you in jail.

572
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:24,456
Then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion:

573
01:10:24,706 --> 01:10:28,956
I hate you... I hate us both!

574
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:32,123
Such a lame scene.

575
01:10:32,373 --> 01:10:35,456
But you are really good.

576
01:10:35,706 --> 01:10:38,789
Thank you dahling!

577
01:10:52,789 --> 01:10:53,664
Hi there!

578
01:10:53,914 --> 01:10:57,039
Who are you?

579
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:11,331
Betty, can I see you outside for a minute?

580
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:29,289
- What is it Coco?
- Your aunt called

581
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:30,748
I was afraid of that.

582
01:11:30,998 --> 01:11:34,914
She wants to know
who's staying in her apartment.

583
01:11:35,539 --> 01:11:38,289
It's just for a night or two,
until she finds her own place.

584
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:40,789
I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth,
but the connection was bad...

585
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:43,873
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

586
01:11:44,123 --> 01:11:46,123
I kept telling her it was my friend Rita...

587
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:49,914
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas...

588
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:52,039
Look at me straight, sweetie.

589
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:54,206
Coco... she's very nice.

590
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,039
Honey... you're a good kid.

591
01:11:56,289 --> 01:11:59,456
What you're telling me is a load of horse-pucky

592
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:02,331
even though it comes from a good place.

593
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,706
Now, I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out

594
01:12:05,956 --> 01:12:09,414
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

595
01:12:09,664 --> 01:12:11,789
Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there.

596
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:13,789
Remember last night?

597
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:17,414
Well, sometimes she's wrong,

598
01:12:17,664 --> 01:12:22,914
but if there is trouble
get rid of it.

599
01:12:31,664 --> 01:12:33,581
Is everything all right?

600
01:12:33,831 --> 01:12:35,539
Is it bad for you that I'm here?

601
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:38,914
No, no, everything is A-okay.

602
01:12:39,164 --> 01:12:41,164
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich!

603
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:45,873
And my audition is in one hour.

604
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:07,039
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours.

605
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:10,206
- Don't drink all the coke.
- Good luck!

606
01:13:10,456 --> 01:13:13,539
When I get back I'll have the cab
waiting, so be ready to go.

607
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:17,206
- Okay.
- Okay?

608
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:46,414
Come in.

609
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:49,498
Betty Elms, I'd like you to meet...

610
01:13:49,748 --> 01:13:52,664
Jack Tuptman, my assistant,

611
01:13:52,914 --> 01:13:54,539
Woody Katz who we've
cast in the part...

612
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:58,789
of "Chuck".
He'll do the scene with you.

613
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,706
Bob Brooker, the director

614
01:14:00,956 --> 01:14:03,498
and Julie Chadwick...

615
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:05,998
Now, our surprise guest is:

616
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:08,289
Linney James.

617
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:10,623
Alas we can't afford her to cast our show,

618
01:14:10,873 --> 01:14:13,498
but as casting agents go...

619
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:16,206
she's the best.

620
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:19,331
Why thank you, Wally.
Hello Betty.

621
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,289
Very pleased to meet you.

622
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:25,248
This is my assistant, Nicki.

623
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:27,581
Oh, and the ever lovely Martha,

624
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:31,706
Martha Johnson, who
you met out front.

625
01:14:31,998 --> 01:14:34,164
Hi.

626
01:14:34,414 --> 01:14:38,623
So shall we get it to go?

627
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:42,373
Would you like a water or a coffee
before we begin?

628
01:14:42,623 --> 01:14:44,373
No, no, I'm fine.

629
01:14:44,623 --> 01:14:49,623
Well then, let's everyone take a seat.

630
01:14:52,039 --> 01:14:57,289
Betty, why don't you join Woody over there
and we'll play the scene.

631
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,164
Bob, do you have anything you wish to say...

632
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:03,289
something to Betty before we begin?

633
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:07,414
No... it's not a contest,

634
01:15:07,664 --> 01:15:13,123
the two of them with themselves,

635
01:15:13,498 --> 01:15:17,039
so don't play it for real...

636
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:21,748
until it gets real.

637
01:15:25,456 --> 01:15:27,289
Okay.

638
01:15:27,539 --> 01:15:29,914
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

639
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:31,081
What?

640
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:33,331
Hey Bobby, I want to play this one nice and close,

641
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:35,289
like
we did with that other girl,

642
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:38,081
what's her name? The one with the black hair.
That felt kinda good.

643
01:15:38,331 --> 01:15:39,831
- Whaddya think?
- That's good, Woody.

644
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:42,373
Just don't rush that line again.

645
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:47,081
I told you...
the line where you say, "Before what?"

646
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:49,873
Bobby, acting is reacting...

647
01:15:50,123 --> 01:15:53,498
I just play off 'em. They all say:

648
01:15:53,748 --> 01:15:55,456
They're gonna arrest you like that...

649
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:57,581
put you in jail...
They all say it the same way,

650
01:15:57,831 --> 01:16:00,039
so I react like that.

651
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,289
What's your name?
- Betty

652
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:07,039
Yeah... Betty, look... You don't rush it. I
don't rush it.

653
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:10,039
We're gonna play it nice and close...

654
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:14,706
just like in the movies. OK?

655
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:19,206
Dad's best friend goes to work.

656
01:16:23,748 --> 01:16:28,164
And ... ACTION!!!!

657
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:35,206
You're still here?

658
01:16:35,206 --> 01:16:38,623
I came back.
I thought that's what you wanted.

659
01:16:38,873 --> 01:16:41,914
- Nobody wants you here.
- Really?

660
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:46,331
My parents are right upstairs!
They think you've left.

661
01:16:46,581 --> 01:16:48,664
So ... surprise!

662
01:16:48,914 --> 01:16:52,123
I can call them...
I can call my dad...

663
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:55,456
But you won't...

664
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:14,039
You're playing a dangerous game here...

665
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:17,081
if you're trying to blackmail me...

666
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:20,831
it's not gonna work.

667
01:17:21,248 --> 01:17:23,498
You know what I want..

668
01:17:23,748 --> 01:17:27,206
it's not that difficult.

669
01:17:28,748 --> 01:17:31,831
Get out...

670
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,623
Get out before I call my dad.

671
01:17:35,873 --> 01:17:37,956
He trusts you...

672
01:17:38,206 --> 01:17:40,164
You're...

673
01:17:40,414 --> 01:17:43,539
his best friend.

674
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:50,248
This will be the end of everything.

675
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:55,331
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

676
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:58,039
Stop...

677
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:01,373
stop it!

678
01:18:01,748 --> 01:18:05,206
That's what you said from the beginning.

679
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:08,331
If I tell them what happened...
they'll arrest you...

680
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:11,998
and put you in jail,

681
01:18:17,623 --> 01:18:19,623
so get out of here...

682
01:18:19,873 --> 01:18:22,789
before...

683
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:28,039
Before what?

684
01:18:45,206 --> 01:18:47,581
Before...

685
01:18:47,831 --> 01:18:51,331
I kill you.

686
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:08,581
Then they'd put you in jail.

687
01:19:16,414 --> 01:19:19,456
I hate you...

688
01:19:19,914 --> 01:19:23,331
I hate us both!

689
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:42,081
- I'm going to take her over there.
- Yeah big time!

690
01:19:44,789 --> 01:19:47,456
Wow!
Well, there it was.

691
01:19:47,706 --> 01:19:49,914
There it was all right!

692
01:19:50,164 --> 01:19:54,498
Baby, you got away with it!

693
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:59,373
Very good. Really.

694
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:02,081
I mean it was forced maybe...

695
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:06,164
but still humanistic.

696
01:20:06,414 --> 01:20:07,164
Yeah,

697
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:09,164
very good,

698
01:20:09,414 --> 01:20:13,498
really.

699
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:20,706
Oh I thank you Betty...

700
01:20:20,956 --> 01:20:23,414
and I really mean that sincerely.

701
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,664
I mean, it was extraordinary.

702
01:20:27,914 --> 01:20:29,414
You've done your Aunt proud...

703
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:33,623
and I'm going to tell her
the first chance I get.

704
01:20:33,873 --> 01:20:36,123
Now, you and I...

705
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,123
are gonna speak again soon.

706
01:20:38,373 --> 01:20:40,498
Thank you Mr. Brown.

707
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:42,498
Thank you, Wally.

708
01:20:42,748 --> 01:20:45,873
I'm sure you all have a
lot to talk about.
We'll walk Betty out.

709
01:20:46,123 --> 01:20:49,873
Well, yes indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Linney.

710
01:20:50,123 --> 01:20:52,498
Don't you be a stranger around here.

711
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:55,664
- We'd love to have you here.
- Come on, Betty.

712
01:20:55,914 --> 01:20:57,498
Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

713
01:20:57,748 --> 01:21:02,123
It was nice meeting all of you.

714
01:21:08,498 --> 01:21:11,248
Wow!

715
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:13,248
How do you find her...

716
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:16,956
God, that was awful!

717
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,623
Not you Betty.
You were stellar and I mean that

718
01:21:19,873 --> 01:21:21,498
But poor Wally.

719
01:21:21,748 --> 01:21:23,623
He'll never get that picture made.
- Why?

720
01:21:23,914 --> 01:21:26,039
Wally's days were up twenty years ago.

721
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:29,206
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor?

722
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:31,456
And the cast is terrible...

723
01:21:31,706 --> 01:21:33,539
Oh, God, terrible

724
01:21:33,831 --> 01:21:35,914
Poor old fool Wally...

725
01:21:36,206 --> 01:21:39,914
It was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

726
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:42,956
and Wally... Mr. Brown...
is a very close friendof my Aunt's, so...

727
01:21:43,206 --> 01:21:45,956
Settle down, Betty. Don't get me wrong.
I love Wally.

728
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:49,664
I ought to. I was married
to him for ten years.

729
01:21:49,914 --> 01:21:52,748
And I love actors, all actors.

730
01:21:52,998 --> 01:21:56,081
We just get a little catty sometimes.

731
01:21:56,331 --> 01:21:58,831
Now we want to take you across
and introduce you to a director...

732
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,748
who's a head above the rest

733
01:22:00,998 --> 01:22:03,789
He's got a project that you would kill!

734
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:07,539
Knock it right out of the park.

735
01:22:08,373 --> 01:22:10,414
~ Sixteen reasons ~

736
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:13,164

Cut it!
Thank you very much, Carol.
I'm coming back.

768
01:24:02,581 --> 01:24:04,789
Check it again?
Check it again!

769
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:06,789
Thank you!
Will tell you what happens next!

770
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,081
Thank you very much, for coming in
I know how busy you are.

771
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:13,206
Oh, are you kidding me? I love this script!
Show me where to sign!

772
01:24:13,456 --> 01:24:15,206
Look... I love you...

773
01:24:15,456 --> 01:24:17,956
but there's no way they're gonna let me cast this thing
until I've seen everyone.

774
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:19,956
- I'll let you know as soon as I can.
- I know you will.

775
01:24:20,206 --> 01:24:24,081
cause my manager's
gonna be bugging you day and night.
... and me.

776
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:26,414
- It'll be my pleasure. Now, get out of here.
- Oh, you're just so cruel to me...

777
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:28,789
don't forget me.
I'm the girl that's going to play this part.

778
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,289
See ya later.

779
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:34,581
Hank... where's Hank?

780
01:24:34,831 --> 01:24:38,539
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

781
01:24:38,623 --> 01:24:41,706
- Is she ready?
- Already.

782
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:45,873
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes next.

783
01:24:50,706 --> 01:24:55,498
Sylvia North's story,
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

784
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,248
Ok, here we go...
Let's lock it up, please!

785
01:24:58,498 --> 01:25:00,748
- Roll sound please...
- That's it!

786
01:25:00,998 --> 01:25:04,456
Playback!
ACTION!

787
01:25:16,873 --> 01:25:18,956
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

788
01:25:19,206 --> 01:25:22,623
~ Oh, baby I've told ~

789
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,664
~ every little star ~

790
01:25:24,914 --> 01:25:29,164
~ just how sweet I think you are ~

791
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:34,373
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

792
01:25:34,623 --> 01:25:36,498
Get Jason over here.

793
01:25:36,748 --> 01:25:40,789
Cindy ... Adam wants to see Jason.
~ I've told ripples in a brook ~

794
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,373
~ Made my heart an open book ~

795
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:52,539
~ Why haven't I told you? ~

796
01:25:53,123 --> 01:25:56,706
~ Friends ask me "am I in love" ~

797
01:25:56,956 --> 01:26:00,956
~ I always answer "yes" ~

798
01:26:01,206 --> 01:26:04,956
~ Might as well confess ~

799
01:26:05,206 --> 01:26:08,581
~ If the answer's yes ~

800
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:12,956
~ Maybe you may love me too ~

801
01:26:13,206 --> 01:26:18,748
~ Oh my darling if you do ~

802
01:26:19,206 --> 01:26:22,623
~ Why haven't you told me? ~
Did you want to tell me something, Adam?

803
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:35,539
This is the girl!

804
01:26:39,123 --> 01:26:43,706
Excellent choice, Adam.

805
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:55,998
Oh... my goodness.

806
01:27:04,331 --> 01:27:06,456
I have to be somewhere.

807
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:09,789
I promised a friend.

808
01:27:10,039 --> 01:27:13,706
I'm sorry. I must go...

809
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:40,456
It should be around here...

810
01:27:40,706 --> 01:27:43,039
2590... That's it.

811
01:27:43,289 --> 01:27:44,789
Up there!

812
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:48,998
- Does it look familiar?
- No.

813
01:27:55,331 --> 01:27:57,623
- Don't stop!
-What is it? What do you see?!

814
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:02,206
- Those men in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?!

815
01:28:02,456 --> 01:28:03,623
No... but...
-Keep going.

816
01:28:03,873 --> 01:28:07,289
Go around to the back.

817
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:58,373
Selwyn... number 12.

818
01:29:20,623 --> 01:29:24,039
Now, you've got me scared.

819
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:52,373
See, I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of!

820
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,664
Betty wait... wait

821
01:30:57,789 --> 01:31:00,706
Oh no... don't.

822
01:31:25,164 --> 01:31:26,748
No one's home.

823
01:31:26,998 --> 01:31:30,289
Yes?

824
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:38,831
Number 17.

825
01:31:38,873 --> 01:31:42,039
But it said number 12.

826
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:47,039
I switched apartments with her.
She's in 17.

827
01:31:47,289 --> 01:31:50,623
It's down in the end on the left.

828
01:31:54,164 --> 01:31:57,914
She hasn't been around for a few days...

829
01:31:59,456 --> 01:32:03,373
- Oh... we'll leave her a note.
- I'll go with you.

830
01:32:05,373 --> 01:32:08,831
She's still got some of my stuff.

831
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:16,831
You go ahead.
I've got to get that.

832
01:32:31,123 --> 01:32:33,248
I guess you're not Diane Selwyn.

833
01:32:33,498 --> 01:32:36,956
Guess I'm not.

834
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:15,914
Still no one's home I guess.

835
01:33:44,123 --> 01:33:45,581
C'mon do it.

836
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:48,539
C'mon help me in. Come on.

837
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:52,206
I'll open the front door.

838
01:33:57,789 --> 01:34:00,873
C'mon.

839
01:36:31,081 --> 01:36:34,456
I know what you're doing.

840
01:36:54,206 --> 01:36:57,623
I know what you have to do,

841
01:36:59,248 --> 01:37:02,706
but let me do it.

842
01:37:10,248 --> 01:37:13,706
Let me do it.

843
01:37:35,748 --> 01:37:39,248
You look like someone else.

844
01:37:59,914 --> 01:38:02,164
Good night, Betty.

845
01:38:02,414 --> 01:38:04,206
You don't wear it in the house.

846
01:38:04,456 --> 01:38:06,331
What?

847
01:38:06,581 --> 01:38:09,331
The wig.

848
01:38:09,581 --> 01:38:12,706
Just I'm looking at myself again...

849
01:38:12,956 --> 01:38:14,664
I'll take it off to sleep.

850
01:38:14,914 --> 01:38:17,123
And you don't have to sleep on that couch.

851
01:38:17,373 --> 01:38:19,373
No, it's okay.

852
01:38:19,623 --> 01:38:22,539
No it's not.
This is a huge bed.

853
01:38:22,789 --> 01:38:26,331
C'mon, just get in and get a good night sleep.

854
01:38:57,123 --> 01:39:00,789
It's more confortable than the couch, isn't it?

855
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:03,873
Yes.

856
01:39:09,748 --> 01:39:12,539
Thank you, Betty.

857
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:14,581
It's nothing.

858
01:39:14,831 --> 01:39:16,956
I shouldn't have let you sleep
on the couch last night.

859
01:39:17,206 --> 01:39:19,748
No... I mean...

860
01:39:19,998 --> 01:39:24,373
Thank you for everything.

861
01:39:26,206 --> 01:39:29,623
You're welcome.

862
01:39:38,289 --> 01:39:41,748
Good night, sweet Betty.

863
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:53,414
Good night.

864
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:37,873
Have you ever done this before?

865
01:40:38,414 --> 01:40:40,331
I don't known!

866
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:43,706
Have you?

867
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:59,831
I want to with you...

868
01:41:24,664 --> 01:41:28,373
I'm in love with you.

869
01:41:41,748 --> 01:41:45,456
I'm in love with you.

870
01:42:11,123 --> 01:42:13,956
Silencio.

871
01:42:14,914 --> 01:42:17,706
Silencio.

872
01:42:18,206 --> 01:42:21,164
Silencio.

873
01:42:22,081 --> 01:42:25,206
No hay banda.

874
01:42:25,789 --> 01:42:29,039
No hay banda.

875
01:42:29,081 --> 01:42:32,331
No hay orquestra.

876
01:42:33,331 --> 01:42:36,456
Silencio.

877
01:42:35,748 --> 01:42:42,789
Silencio.

878
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:46,581
Silencio.

879
01:42:47,414 --> 01:42:50,248
Silencio.

880
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:53,664
Rita?
- No hay banda.

881
01:42:53,914 --> 01:42:56,998
Rita, wake up

882
01:42:58,289 --> 01:43:01,998
- No, no...
- It's ok, it's ok.

883
01:43:02,248 --> 01:43:04,998
No it's not ok.

884
01:43:05,248 --> 01:43:08,123
What's wrong?

885
01:43:08,373 --> 01:43:11,831
Go with me somewhere...

886
01:43:12,664 --> 01:43:18,123
It's 2 o'clock
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

887
01:43:19,539 --> 01:43:22,706
Go with me somewhere...

888
01:43:22,956 --> 01:43:28,039
Sure. Now?

889
01:43:28,248 --> 01:43:32,456
Right now!

890
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:07,873
No hay banda!

891
01:45:08,123 --> 01:45:11,623
There is no band!

892
01:45:11,873 --> 01:45:15,789
Il n'est pas de orquestra!

893
01:45:16,039 --> 01:45:18,623
This is all...

894
01:45:18,873 --> 01:45:21,539
a tape-recording.

895
01:45:21,789 --> 01:45:22,789
No hay banda!

896
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:28,206
and yet
we hear a band.

897
01:45:28,331 --> 01:45:31,748
If we want to hear a clarinette...

898
01:45:31,998 --> 01:45:34,498
listen...

899
01:45:39,914 --> 01:45:45,206
Un trombon "?coulisse".

900
01:45:47,831 --> 01:45:51,873
Un trombon "con sordina".

901
01:45:51,998 --> 01:45:58,956
Sient le son du trombon in sourdine.

902
01:46:01,581 --> 01:46:04,373
Hear le son...

903
01:46:04,581 --> 01:46:09,539
and mute it... drop it...

904
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:30,206
It's all recorded.

905
01:46:31,414 --> 01:46:35,831
No hay banda!

906
01:46:35,873 --> 01:46:40,789
It's all a tape.

907
01:46:49,914 --> 01:46:52,748
Il n'est pas de orquestra.

908
01:46:52,998 --> 01:46:55,289
It is...

909
01:46:55,539 --> 01:46:59,081
an illusion.

910
01:47:02,248 --> 01:47:05,206
Listen...

911
01:48:18,289 --> 01:48:20,539
Senoras y senores...

912
01:48:20,789 --> 01:48:26,914
el club Silencio les presenta
la llorona de Los Angeles:

913
01:48:27,164 --> 01:48:31,581
Rebekah del Rio.

914
01:53:10,373 --> 01:53:12,831
Betty?

915
01:53:15,248 --> 01:53:17,623
Betty?

916
01:53:29,081 --> 01:53:32,706
Donde estas?

917
01:53:44,789 --> 01:53:47,248
Betty?

918
01:56:14,539 --> 01:56:17,664
Hey, pretty little girl...

919
01:56:17,914 --> 01:56:21,373
time to wake up.

920
01:57:56,706 --> 01:58:00,206
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

921
01:58:00,456 --> 01:58:04,039
My lamp and dishes...

922
01:58:05,164 --> 01:58:09,039
C'mon Diane,
it's been three weeks.

923
01:58:10,498 --> 01:58:14,206
I put your dishes in that box.

924
01:58:33,456 --> 01:58:37,664
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

925
01:58:48,873 --> 01:58:49,831
Anytime...

926
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:54,164
I'm just making sure, Diane.

927
01:59:02,498 --> 01:59:06,206
- That is it?
- Yeah

928
01:59:10,331 --> 01:59:15,081
Ah, by the way, those two detectives
came by again, looking for you.

929
02:00:07,206 --> 02:00:09,873
Camilla!

930
02:00:12,331 --> 02:00:15,456
You've come back!

931
02:01:56,039 --> 02:01:59,331
What was that you were saying, beautiful?

932
02:01:59,581 --> 02:02:01,706
I said:

933
02:02:01,956 --> 02:02:05,414
You drive me wild.

934
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:20,581
We shouldn't do this anymore...

935
02:02:25,956 --> 02:02:29,081
Don't say that...

936
02:02:33,123 --> 02:02:35,831
Don't ever say that!

937
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:37,998
Don't Diane,

938
02:02:38,248 --> 02:02:42,123
Stop it...
Diane STOP!

939
02:02:42,373 --> 02:02:46,289
I've tried to tell you this before.

940
02:02:53,956 --> 02:02:57,706
It's him, isn't it?

941
02:03:07,623 --> 02:03:09,789
I'm not trying to show you how to do the scene.

942
02:03:10,039 --> 02:03:12,456
Just watch me...

943
02:03:12,706 --> 02:03:16,331
and I think you'll understand what I'm getting at.

944
02:03:19,706 --> 02:03:21,873
Don't seat so rigid...

945
02:03:22,123 --> 02:03:25,373
just, just relax...

946
02:03:25,623 --> 02:03:27,498
You two are here alone...

947
02:03:27,748 --> 02:03:31,331
and it's real comfortable...

948
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:34,039
like you've known each other forever...

949
02:03:34,289 --> 02:03:38,498
ven if you don't say anything...
It's real comfortable.

950
02:03:39,373 --> 02:03:41,123
Hank, can you just clear the set...

951
02:03:41,373 --> 02:03:43,873
there's too many people around here...
Let's get this worked out...

952
02:03:44,123 --> 02:03:46,456
Clear the set!
Clear the set!

953
02:03:46,706 --> 02:03:49,414
Everyone get another cup of coffee.

954
02:03:49,664 --> 02:03:52,831
- Everyone please!
- Can Diane stay?

955
02:03:53,081 --> 02:03:59,123
Yes, true. Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay.

956
02:04:03,956 --> 02:04:05,706
Now when she starts to cry...

957
02:04:05,956 --> 02:04:09,414
don't pull her toward you.

958
02:04:09,623 --> 02:04:12,623
Let her fall in to you...

959
02:04:12,873 --> 02:04:16,331
Let her fall.

960
02:04:18,331 --> 02:04:21,789
When you kiss her...

961
02:04:21,956 --> 02:04:26,289
It's just a continuation of that move

962
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:30,081
There is no break...

963
02:04:54,581 --> 02:04:57,664
Kill the lights!

964
02:05:06,456 --> 02:05:07,706
Don't be mad!

965
02:05:07,956 --> 02:05:11,123
- Don't make it be like this!
- Oh, sure.

966
02:05:11,373 --> 02:05:13,914
You want me to make this easy for you? No!

967
02:05:14,164 --> 02:05:17,248
No-fucking-way it's not gonna be!

968
02:05:17,498 --> 02:05:21,498
It's not easy for me!!!

969
02:06:44,123 --> 02:06:45,664
Hello, it's me...

970
02:06:45,956 --> 02:06:48,998
leave a message...

971
02:06:56,539 --> 02:06:59,456
Hello?

972
02:07:02,581 --> 02:07:05,123
Diane, the car is waiting.

973
02:07:05,373 --> 02:07:07,164
Are you ok?

974
02:07:07,414 --> 02:07:10,539
You comin'?

975
02:07:15,123 --> 02:07:16,789
Good...

976
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:19,956
It means so much to me.

977
02:07:20,206 --> 02:07:23,789
Go on... the car is right outside the house..

978
02:07:24,039 --> 02:07:27,456
It's been waiting, ok ?

979
02:07:31,081 --> 02:07:32,789
Ok.

980
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,789
It's 6980, Mulholland drive.

981
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:41,456
Mulholland drive.

982
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:54,331
What are you doing?
We don't stop here...

983
02:08:57,581 --> 02:09:01,456
A surprise...

984
02:09:22,706 --> 02:09:26,123
Shortcut.

985
02:09:26,706 --> 02:09:29,789
C'mon sweetheart.

986
02:09:34,748 --> 02:09:36,706
It's beautiful.

987
02:09:36,956 --> 02:09:40,414
A secret path.

988
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:49,539
Ah, perfect timing!

989
02:10:49,956 --> 02:10:53,123
Welcome, Diane.

990
02:10:57,789 --> 02:10:59,831
Well...

991
02:11:00,081 --> 02:11:03,664
Here's to love...

992
02:11:11,789 --> 02:11:14,581
Here's to love...

993
02:11:18,539 --> 02:11:21,873
Ah, here she is...

994
02:11:29,914 --> 02:11:33,456
I don't believe you met my mother...

995
02:11:33,581 --> 02:11:35,831
Hi, I'm Diane Selwyn.

996
02:11:36,081 --> 02:11:38,623
Just call me Coco, everybody does...

997
02:11:38,873 --> 02:11:40,998
- Pleased to meet you...
- Let's eat...

998
02:11:41,248 --> 02:11:44,373
I'm starving...

999
02:11:49,539 --> 02:11:53,164
I'm sorry, I was late.

1000
02:12:11,998 --> 02:12:15,039
I'm from Deep River, Ontario...

1001
02:12:15,289 --> 02:12:17,039
a small town.

1002
02:12:17,289 --> 02:12:21,664
So, you rolled in here from Canada.

1003
02:12:21,914 --> 02:12:25,373
I've always wanted to come here.

1004
02:12:25,581 --> 02:12:29,039
I won this ballet contest...

1005
02:12:29,289 --> 02:12:32,664
that sort of led to acting...

1006
02:12:33,081 --> 02:12:36,998
you know, wanting to act.

1007
02:12:37,164 --> 02:12:40,623
When my aunt died...

1008
02:12:40,873 --> 02:12:45,331
anyway, she left me so money...
she worked here...

1009
02:12:45,581 --> 02:12:48,164
In the movies?

1010
02:12:48,414 --> 02:12:50,748
Yes.

1011
02:12:50,998 --> 02:12:54,998
How did you meet Camilla?

1012
02:12:55,248 --> 02:12:57,331
On a "Sylvia North Story".

1013
02:12:57,581 --> 02:13:00,998
Camilla was great in that.

1014
02:13:14,748 --> 02:13:18,831
Yeah, I wanted the lead so bad.

1015
02:13:19,081 --> 02:13:23,081
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

1016
02:13:24,998 --> 02:13:27,373
The director...

1017
02:13:27,623 --> 02:13:29,706
Bob Brooker?

1018
02:13:29,956 --> 02:13:32,831
Yes.

1019
02:13:34,123 --> 02:13:37,581
Hadn't so much of me...

1020
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:45,081
anyway, that's when we became friends.

1021
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:47,081
She helped me...

1022
02:13:47,331 --> 02:13:52,373
getting some parts
in some of her films.

1023
02:13:53,164 --> 02:13:55,873
I see.

1024
02:14:09,414 --> 02:14:11,956
So, I got the pool...

1025
02:14:12,248 --> 02:14:15,748
and she got the pool-man.

1026
02:14:16,456 --> 02:14:21,998
I couldn't believe it
I wanted to buy that judge a Rolls-Royce.

1027
02:14:27,373 --> 02:14:30,831
Sometimes good things happen.

1028
02:15:23,373 --> 02:15:27,164
So, I guess we saved the best for last...

1029
02:15:29,164 --> 02:15:30,414
Do you want to tell them?

1030
02:15:30,664 --> 02:15:34,081
No, you to tell them.

1031
02:15:36,831 --> 02:15:40,248
Camilla and I...

1032
02:15:51,373 --> 02:15:54,789
are going to be...

1033
02:16:05,206 --> 02:16:08,289
Sorry about that.

1034
02:16:15,373 --> 02:16:18,456
No, I'm fine.

1035
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:26,623
This is the girl.

1036
02:16:26,873 --> 02:16:30,206
Don't show me this photothing here.

1037
02:16:30,456 --> 02:16:34,914
It's just an actress' photo, everybody's got one.

1038
02:16:35,164 --> 02:16:37,623
You got the money?

1039
02:16:37,873 --> 02:16:40,998
Sure do.

1040
02:16:50,998 --> 02:16:56,623
Ok, once you hand that over to me, it's a done deal.

1041
02:16:58,039 --> 02:17:02,331
Are you sure you want this?

1042
02:17:05,748 --> 02:17:09,373
More than anything in this world.

1043
02:17:19,206 --> 02:17:22,706
When it's finished, you'll find this where I told you.

1044
02:17:36,414 --> 02:17:39,748
What's it open?

1045
02:22:04,164 --> 02:22:08,039
Silencio
