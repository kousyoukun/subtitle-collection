1
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,835
路摸思
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,025
路摸思
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:06,339
路摸思
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,286
(终极咒语)

5
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,936
路摸思
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:20,145
哈利波特：阿兹卡班的逃犯

7
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:42,836
哈利．．．
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:45,023
去开门
Harry, open the door.

9
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,252
玛姬，你好．．．
Marge. How lovely to see--

10
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:57,834
姨丈我想请你帮我签同意书
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,248
什么同意书？
What is it?

12
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:01,579
没什么，学校的同意书
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,440
如果你听话的话，我就帮你签
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,788
我是怕她不让你签
I will if she does.

15
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,167
-喔．．．你还赖在这儿啊 -没错
-Oh, you're still here, are you? -Yes.

16
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:13,146
不要用这种不屑的口气跟我说话
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,261
我哥就是太好心才会收留你
Damn good of my brother to keep you.

18
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,848
如果他被丢在我家门口 我一定会把他送到孤儿院
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,385
我亲爱的小达力在这里啊
Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,259
来，亲一个
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,715
还不快把行李拿到楼上去
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,901
是的
Okay.

23
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:37,187
帮妈妈把菜吃完 好乖好乖，杀手乖
Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,161
-玛姬，要不要来一杯 -一小杯就好了
-Can I tempt you, Marge? -Just a small one.

25
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,262
佩妮，你菜烧得好棒
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,814
再多一点
A bit more.

27
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:50,784
通常我都是．．． 随便做点东西给自己和狗吃
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 1 2 dogs.

28
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,515
再多一点，这还差不多
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,560
你也想尝尝白兰地吗？
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:02,852
只能喝一点点，不要喝醉了
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,064
你在偷笑什么？
What are you smirking at?

32
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,103
你说你送这小子去哪里读书啊？
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?

33
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:11,634
圣布鲁特 是一所专门收容不良少年的机构
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,819
那个地方会用藤条打人吗？
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,417
喔，会！
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,457
我常常被打得好惨喔
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

37
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:25,212
太好了 我才不相信什么要用爱的教育
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...

38
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,576
不能体罚来对付学生
...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:31,840
不用因这小子不学好就责怪自己
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:35,988
这跟血统有关系 先天不良后天失调嘛
It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:38,241
这小子的爸爸是做什么的？
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?

42
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:41,443
没做什么，他一直没工作 是个无业游民
Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.

43
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:44,447
-一定还酗酒吧 -你们说谎
-And a drunk too, no doubt? -That's a lie.

44
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:47,166
-你说什么？ -我爸爸没有酗酒
-What did you say? -My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:54,306
没事，不要紧张，佩妮 我的手劲就是这么强
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:56,216
我想你应该去睡觉了
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:59,677
闭嘴，威农 你清干净
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,866
事实上 这跟父亲没关系
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.

49
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:08,042
全因为母亲的血统 看狗就知道了
It's all to do with the mother. You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:12,286
要是母狗的血统有问题 生出来的小狗也会出毛病
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,057
闭嘴，闭嘴．．．
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:20,798
干什么？
Right.

53
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:23,114
我警告你．．．
Let me tell you....

54
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,703
威农
Vernon!

55
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,534
威农．．．快点想办法啊
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,980
停住
Stop!

57
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,142
玛姬，我抓住你了
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

58
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,556
你不能放手
-Hold on, hold on. -Get off.

59
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,624
-你敢放手试试看！ -对不起
-Don't you dare! -Sorry.

60
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,628
威农，你还好吗？
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,522
哦，天啊！
Oh, God.

62
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,495
玛姬
Marge!

63
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,822
拜托
Please!

64
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,621
玛姬．．．
Marge!

65
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,934
快回来
Come back!

66
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,297
你快把她变回来
You bring her back! You bring her back now.

67
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,769
-现在马上让她恢复原状 -不要，那是她罪有应得
-You put her right! -No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,329
-你最好不要来惹我 -你们不能在学校外使用魔法
-Keep away from me. -You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:50,523
-是吗？试试看啊 -你会被学校开除的
-Yeah? Try me. -They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:51,962
然后你哪儿也去不了
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,507
我才不在乎，哪里都比这里好
I don't care. Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:58,068
救命

73
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,326
救命

74
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,480
欢迎搭乘骑士公车
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

75
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:36,083
这是为陷入困境的巫师 提供的紧急交通工具
...emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.

76
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,281
我的名字叫做史坦桑派 今天晚上我担任车掌，为你服务
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."

77
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,311
你为什么要坐地上啊？
What you doing down there?

78
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,240
-跌倒了 -你没事干嘛跌倒呀？
-I fell over. -What you fell over for?

79
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:52,096
-我又不是故意跌倒的 -好了，上车吧
-I didn't do it on purpose. -Well, come on, then.

80
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,478
哪有那么多时间跟你穷蘑菇
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

81
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,690
-你在看什么呀？ -没什么
-What you looking at? -Nothing.

82
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,538
好了，快上车，来
Well, come on, then. In.

83
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,593
我来提行李，你快上车
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

84
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,734
好了
Come on.

85
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,407
往前走，往前走．．．
Come on. Move on, move on.

86
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,444
-开车，尔尼 -好耶，开车，尔尼
-Take her away, Ern. -Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

87
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:49,803
接下来的旅程很不平静喔
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

88
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:03,826
-你刚刚说你叫什么？ -我没说啊
-What did you say your name was? -I didn't.

89
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:08,528
-请问你目的地在哪里？ -破釜酒吧，在伦敦
-Whereabouts are you headed? -The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

90
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,658
听见了吗，尔尼？ 破釜酒吧，在伦敦喔
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."

91
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,132
在破釜酒吧 如果那里有豆子汤要赶快喝光
The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup...

92
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:17,120
免得豆子汤把你吃掉
...make sure you eat it before it eats you.

93
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:23,149
-麻瓜．．．不会看到我们吗？ -麻瓜？
-But the Muggles. Can't they see us? -Muggles?

94
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,014
他们根本什么都不会注意到
They don't see nothing, do they?

95
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:27,782
不过拿叉子戳他们 他们还是会痛的
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

96
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:32,608
尔尼，十二点方向有个老太太
Ernie, little old lady at 1 2 o'clock!

97
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,827
十，九，八．．．
Ten, nine, eight...

98
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:46,777
七，六，五，四．．．

99
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,193
三，二又二分之一．．．
...four, three, three and a half...

100
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:51,175
二，一又四分之三．．．
...two, one and three quarters.

101
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,332
冲啊！
Yes!

102
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,069
他是谁啊？
Who is that?

103
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:01,679
那个人
That man.

104
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,124
他是谁啊？
Who is that?

105
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,806
你说他呀，他就是．．．
Who is--?

106
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,455
天狼星布莱克
That is Sirius Black, that is.

107
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:13,327
别告诉我．．． 你从没听过天狼星布莱克
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.

108
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,853
他是一个凶手
He's a murderer.

109
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:19,669
因为杀人被关在阿兹卡班
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.

110
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:23,779
他是怎么逃出来的？
-How did he escape? -Well, that's the question, isn't it?

111
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:25,855
他是第一个脱逃成功的犯人
He's the first one that done it.

112
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:29,479
他是最支持那个人
He was a big supporter of...

113
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,429
那个人是谁．．．
...You-Know-Who.

114
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:34,021
你应该听过吧
I reckon you've heard of him.

115
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:35,774
是的
Yeah.

116
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,268
我是听过
Him I've heard of.

117
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,693
十二点方向有两辆双层巴士
Ernie, two double-deckers at 1 2 o'clock.

118
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,819
越来越近了，尔尼
They're getting closer, Ernie.

119
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:47,883
要撞上来了
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

120
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,704
小心你的头
Mind your head.

121
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:04,526
各位，各位？
Hey, guys? Guys?

122
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,895
干嘛把脸拉那么长？
Why the long faces?

123
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,188
好耶，好耶，差不多了．．．
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

124
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:24,034
-破釜酒吧到了 -下一站，夜行巷
-The Leaky Cauldron. -Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

125
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:28,004
波特先生，你终于到了

128
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,617
嘿美
Hedwig.

129
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,686
聪明的猫头鹰自己找来了
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.

130
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:09,590
他也是五分钟前才刚到而已
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.

131
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,124
身为魔法部长，我有义务告诉你
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...

132
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:18,475
今晚稍早．．． 我们在南英格兰找到你的姑妈
...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located...

133
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:22,641
当时她正绕着烟囱团团飞
...a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.

134
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,541
魔法意外矫正部派人过去处理了
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.

135
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:31,560
他们把你姑妈的气放光了 也修正她的记忆
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.

136
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:36,430
她会完全不记得．．． 这整件事情是怎么发生的
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.

137
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,134
所以．．．
So that's that...

138
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,187
事情解决了 没有造成任何的伤害
...and no harm done.

139
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,123
喝豆子汤吗？
Pea soup?

140
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,455
不了，谢谢
No, thank you.

141
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,828
-部长？ -什么事？
-Minister? -Yes?

142
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,746
我有点不懂 我违反了规则
-I don't understand. -Understand?

143
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:54,521
未成年巫师不能在家里施魔法
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.

144
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,733
魔法部不会因为有人把姑妈．．．
Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban...

145
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:00,416
吹成汽球，就把他关到阿兹卡班
...for blowing up their aunts.

146
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,994
可是做了这种事就随便逃家 尤其是在目前的情势下．．．
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things...

147
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:11,568
可是非常非常不负责任的喔
...was very, very irresponsible.

148
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:15,590
-请问什么样的情势啊？ -现在外头有逃犯啊
-"The state of things," sir? -We have a killer on the loose.

149
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,509
天狼星布莱克吗？
Sirius Black, you mean?

150
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:19,440
可是这跟我有什么关系？
But what's he got to do with me?

151
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:26,679
当然没关系 你现在很安全，这才是最重要的
Nothing, of course. You're safe. And that's what matters.

152
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,938
明天你就可以回霍格华兹去了
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.

153
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,076
那边都是你这学期的教科书
These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty...

154
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:37,280
我要书店把你的书都送过来了 现在汤姆带你到客房去
...of having them brought here. Now Tom will show you to your room.

155
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,378
嘿美
Hedwig.

156
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:48,707
对了，哈利，你在这个时候呢 最好是不要到处．．．
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't...

157
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,372
乱逛
...wander.

158
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,861
喂！到底你要不要移车啊？
Right! You gonna move that bus or what?

159
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:15,282
《怪兽的怪兽书》

160
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,625
整理客房
Housekeeping.

161
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,312
我等一下再来
I'll come back later.

162
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,288
赫敏，我警告你
I'm warning you, Hermione.

163
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:35,253
叫你那只讨厌的怪物离斑斑远点 不然我就把他变成杯垫
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

164
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,447
他只是只猫
It's a cat, Ronald. What do you expect?

165
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,656
-猫抓老鼠是天生的 -什么猫，我说他是怪物
-It's in his nature. -A cat? Is that what they told you?

166
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,339
-他根本就是一头长毛猪 -真好笑
-Looks like a pig with hair. -That's rich...

167
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,042
自己养了一只毛茸茸的臭鞋刷
...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.

168
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:48,708
没关系，歪腿 不要理这个讨厌鬼
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.

169
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,405
哈利！
Harry.

170
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,911
哈利！
Harry.

171
00:16:54,018 --> 00:16:57,208
-你去埃及？那里是什么样子？ -帅呆了，有好多古迹
-Egypt. What's it like? -Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

172
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,763
木乃伊、金字塔．．． 连斑斑都玩得很开心
...Iike mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

173
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,158
埃及人以前还会拜猫 是喔，他们还拜蜣螂咧
-Egyptians used to worship cats. -Along with the dung beetle.

174
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:07,494
-又拿剪报出来现了 -我才没有拿给别人看
-Not flashing that clipping again? -I haven't shown anyone.

175
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,034
真的没有，除了拿给汤姆
No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom.

176
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:11,596
白天的服务生．．．晚上的服务生
-The day maid. -Night maid.

177
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:13,885
厨师．．．修厕所的水电工
-Cook. -The bloke who fixed the toilet.

178
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,466
-还有比利时的巫师 -卫斯理太太
-Harry. -Mrs. Weasley.

179
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,826
-看到你真是太开心了，亲爱的 -我也是
-Good to see you, dear. -Good to see you.

180
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,297
-东西都准备好了吗？ -好了
-Got everything? -Yes.

181
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,663
-那教科书都买好了吗？ -是呀，在楼上
-Yes? All your books? -It's all upstairs.

182
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:23,204
-所有的制服呢？ -全部都在楼上
-Your clothes? -Everything.

183
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,629
-真是个好孩子 -谢谢
-Good boy. -Thank you.

184
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,860
-哈利波特 -卫斯理先生
-Harry Potter. -Mr. Weasley.

185
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:30,592
-哈利，我可以跟你说句话吗？ -当然可以啊
-Harry, wonder if I might have a word? -Yeah, sure.

186
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:33,394
-赫敏 -早安，卫斯理先生
-Hermione. -Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

187
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:37,241
-等不及要去学校了？ -这学期一定很棒
-Looking forward to a new term? -Yeah. It should be great.

188
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:44,161
魔法部有很多人．．． 都强烈反对我告诉你
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me...

189
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,942
我现在要说的这件事
...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.

190
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:50,479
不过我认为必须让你知道实情
But I think that you need to know the facts.

191
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:53,211
你现在很危险
You are in danger.

192
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,350
非常的危险
Grave danger.

193
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:59,487
这跟天狼星布莱克有关系吗？
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?

194
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,684
你对天狼星的事情了解多少？
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?

195
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:06,608
-我只知道他从阿兹卡班逃狱 -知道为什么吗？
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban. -Do you know why?

196
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,073
十三年前，当你阻止了．．．
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped....

197
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,035
-佛地魔 -不要说出他的名字
-Voldemort. -Don't say his name.

198
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,515
对不起
Sorry.

199
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:16,652
当你阻止了．．． 你知道的那个人
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

200
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,395
天狼星就失去了一切
...Black lost everything.

201
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:22,971
但是一直到今天，他都还对 你知道的那个人，非常地忠心
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.

202
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:25,224
在他心里
And in his mind...

203
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,426
你也是唯一有能力 能够阻止．．．
...you are the only thing that stands in the way...

204
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:32,366
你知道的那个人 恢复力量
...of You-Know-Who returning to power.

205
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,630
这就是为什么
And that is why...

206
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:37,385
他要从阿兹卡班逃狱
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

207
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,387
目的就是为了找你
To find you.

208
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,485
把我杀了
And kill me.

209
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:46,133
我要你发誓，不管你听到什么
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear...

210
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,825
都不可以主动去找天狼星
...you won't go looking for Black.

211
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,516
卫斯理先生
Mr. Weasley...

212
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,794
我干嘛主动去找要杀我的人呢？
...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

213
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,241
快点！快点！
Quick. Quick.

214
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,248
罗恩．．．
Ron, Ron!

215
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:02,055
我的天啊
Oh, for goodness' sake!

216
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,749
不要忘了他
Don't lose him!

217
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,825
我不是故意要把她吹成气球 我只是．．．
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just--

218
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,486
-忍无可忍 -真好玩
-I lost control. -Brilliant.

219
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,298
罗恩，这不好玩 哈利没被开除，就算很幸运
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

220
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,123
应该说很幸运我没被抓去关
I was lucky not to be arrested.

221
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,334
但我还是觉得很好玩
I still think it was brilliant.

222
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,290
进去吧，其他车厢都满了
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

223
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,453
这人是谁啊？
Who do you think that is?

224
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:28,554
-路平教授 -你什么都知道
-Professor R.J. Lupin. -Do you know everything?

225
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,817
她为什么什么都知道？
How is it she knows everything?

226
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,164
行李上就有名字啊
-It's on his suitcase, Ronald. -Oh.

227
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,744
-他是不是真的睡着了？ -应该是吧，干嘛？
-Do you think he's really asleep? -Seems to be. Why?

228
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,562
有重要的事情要告诉你们
I gotta tell you something.

229
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:58,295
先让我弄清楚 天狼星布莱克逃狱
Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

230
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,346
-为了追杀你 -没错
-...to come after you? -Yeah.

231
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,413
可是他早晚会被抓回去
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

232
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,418
-大家都在追捕他 -对啊
-I mean, everyone's looking for him. -Sure.

233
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:08,944
从来没有一个人．．． 能够成功逃出阿兹卡班
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before...

234
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:12,970
-布莱克是个神经失常的凶手 -谢谢你喔，罗恩
-...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. -Thanks, Ron.

235
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,938
为什么会忽然停车？
Why are we stopping?

236
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,749
学校还没到
We can't be there yet.

237
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,246
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

238
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:28,130
不知道，大概车子故障了
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.

239
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,390
你踩到我的脚了
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

240
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,179
外面有东西在动
There's something moving out there.

241
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:51,832
我觉得．．．好像有人上车了
I think someone's coming aboard.

242
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:19,893
我的天啊，到底怎么了？
Bloody hell! What's happening?

243
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,368
哈利！
Harry.

244
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,322
哈利，你还好吧？
Harry, are you all right?

245
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,151
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:47,793
来，把这个吃掉，你会舒服一点
Here, eat this. It'll help.

247
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,409
不要怕，这是巧克力
It's all right. It's chocolate.

248
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,780
刚刚那是什么．．．东西？
What was that thing that came?

249
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:02,451
那是催狂魔，他是阿兹卡班的守卫 他已经走了
It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.

250
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:05,283
他是来搜查天狼星布莱克
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.

251
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,126
不好意思 我现在要去跟驾驶说几句话
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.

252
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,607
快吃，你会觉得好一点
Eat. You'll feel better.

253
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,678
我是怎么了？
What happened to me?

254
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,595
你整个人都僵掉了
Well, you sort of went rigid.

255
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,993
就像是羊癫疯发作一样
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.

256
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,471
那．．．你们刚刚有人也．．．
And did either of you two...

257
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:33,954
也跟着．．．
...you know...

258
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:37,294
-昏倒吗？ -没有
-...pass out? -No.

259
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,107
只是有种奇怪的感觉
I felt weird, though.

260
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,117
好像这辈子再也开心不起来
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

261
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,598
我听到有人在尖叫
But someone was screaming.

262
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,102
是个女的
A woman.

263
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:49,091
刚刚没有人尖叫
No one was screaming, Harry.

264
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:16,860
(活米村)

265
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:52,276
欢迎大家 来到霍格华兹度过新的一年
Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.

266
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:54,389
让各位拼命大吃．．．
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

267
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,984
到头昏脑胀之前 我得先说几句话
...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.

268
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:02,424
首先，让我们欢迎路平教授
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin...

269
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:04,992
他已经欣然同意接受
...who's kindly consented to fill the post...

270
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,663
黑魔法防御术教授的职位
...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

271
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,359
祝你好运，教授
Good luck, professor.

272
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:18,340
哈利，怪不得他要给你吃巧克力
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

273
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,144
波特 你真的昏倒了？
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

274
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:24,992
-我是说真的不省人事？ -闭嘴啦，马份
-I mean, you actually fainted? -Shove off, Malfoy.

275
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,117
-他怎么会知道的？ -不要理他
-How did he find out? -Just forget it.

276
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,677
担任奇兽饲育学校教授好几年
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher...

277
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:31,725
但是这学期他决定退休
...has decided to retire...

278
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,740
好跟他残余四肢有更多时间相处
...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.

279
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,597
我现在很高兴的宣布
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...

280
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:41,609
接替这个职位的人，正是．．．
...that his place will be taken by none other...

281
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:46,178
我们的猎场看守人鲁霸海格
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

282
00:25:57,273 --> 00:26:00,190
最后，我要宣布的是．．．
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

283
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:02,873
我们收到了魔法部的要求．．．
...at the request of the Ministry of Magic...

284
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:08,363
霍格华兹必须在接到进一步通知之前 要款待几名阿兹卡班的催狂魔
...Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

285
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:12,423
直到天狼星布莱克被捕
...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.

286
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:17,075
催狂魔将守在 霍格华兹所有的出入口
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.

287
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,823
虽然魔法部已经保证过
Now whilst I've been assured...

288
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:22,746
不会让催狂魔影响我们的活动
...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities...

289
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,151
不过大家还是要小心
...a word of caution.

290
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:27,596
催狂魔知道你心中的恐惧
Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish...

291
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:31,182
任何伪装或幻术都骗不过他们
...between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.

292
00:26:31,206 --> 00:26:34,990
所以我要警告你们在座的每个人
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...

293
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,793
千万不要让他们找到理由伤害你
...to give them no reason to harm you.

294
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:44,728
催狂魔对谁都不会手下留情
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.

295
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:50,094
不过呢 我们还是可以找点乐子
But you know, happiness can be found...

296
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:53,872
虽然是在这么黑暗的时期
...even in the darkest of times...

297
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:58,995
只要点燃灯．．．光明就会再现
...if one only remembers to turn on the light.

298
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,920
最年长的命运女神
Fortuna Major.

299
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:18,457
你们看，她就是不让我进去
Here, listen. She just won't let me in.

300
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:21,612
-最年长的命运女神 -不．．．等等
-Fortuna Major. -No, no. Wait, wait.

301
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:23,563
看这个
Watch this.

302
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:39,404
-太棒了，我的歌喉真美妙 -最年长的命运女神
-Amazing. Just with my voice. -Fortuna Major.

303
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:43,118
-好了好了，进去吧 -谢谢
-Yes, all right. Go in. -Thank you.

304
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:47,029
我真不敢相信她还是没变 三年了，她还是这样拼命唱歌
Still doing that after three years.

305
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:49,364
-她根本不会唱歌 -真是难听死了
-She can't even sing. -Exactly.

306
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,769
-嘿，你好 -嘿，你好
-Hey, man. -Hey, man.

307
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,141
-天啊 -真可怕
-Oh, God. -That's awful.

308
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,307
是绿色，表演猴子
Green. That's a monkey.

309
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:02,799
-那是什么啊？ -这也算是猴子吗？
-What is that? -You call that a monkey?

310
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,148
不要再给他吃了
Do not give him one again.

311
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,970
奈威，试试大象
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

312
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,776
-接着，罗恩 -没问题
-Ron, catch. -I will.

313
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,075
胜利者出现了
I think we have a winner.

314
00:28:24,948 --> 00:28:27,379
-不．．．不要再试了 -不得了
-Oh, don't try one of them. -Oh, no.

315
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:30,515
-你看看哈利 -他的脸
Look at him. His face.

316
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:16,387
各位同学，欢迎你们
Welcome, my children.

317
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:21,769
在这堂课里 我们将深入探索神圣的占卜学
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.

318
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:27,297
只要具有透视的能力 我相信你们将会有所发现
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.

319
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:32,604
大家好，我是崔老妮教授
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

320
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:37,406
我们将在这堂课程中 一起参透未来
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.

321
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:41,448
这学期将要学习占卜的基本技巧 就是学习如何观看茶叶
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.

322
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:45,167
请把你对面同学的杯子拿起来
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.

323
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,949
看到了什么？
What do you see?

324
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:52,966
真相往往被深埋起来 就像书中的字句一样，必须慢慢地阅读
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.

325
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,469
首先一定要敞开心胸
But first, you must broaden your minds.

326
00:29:55,535 --> 00:30:00,238
-而目光一定要穿透现在 -真是一堆胡说八道
-First, you must look beyond. -What a load of rubbish.

327
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:02,255
你从哪儿冒出来的？
-Where did you come from? -Me?

328
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,117
-我一直都在这里啊 -孩子
-I've been here all this time. -You, boy....

329
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,574
你奶奶还好吧？
Is your grandmother quite well?

330
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:09,641
应该还好吧
I think so.

331
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:12,666
我可不敢这么肯定，杯子给我
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup.

332
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:16,978
可惜
Pity.

333
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:19,859
敞开心胸
Broaden your minds.

334
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,838
你身上充满了死亡的气息 你是不是会死呢？
Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond?

335
00:30:26,865 --> 00:30:28,846
-我想应该会 -是
-I think you are. -Sure.

336
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:31,289
看杯子里面，告诉我看到什么
Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.

337
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,137
好
Yeah.

338
00:30:33,905 --> 00:30:38,531
我看到哈利将会十分不平静 他将走向磨练与痛苦
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering.

339
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:42,560
还有，我还看到了太阳 那代表一种幸福
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.

340
00:30:42,648 --> 00:30:44,000
所以．．．
So...

341
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:48,348
他会遇到磨难 可是他会愉快接受
...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.

342
00:30:48,386 --> 00:30:49,773
把杯子给我
Give me the cup.

343
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,270
喔，我的天啊
Oh, my dear boy.

344
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,991
孩子
My dear...

345
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:02,822
你身上有．．． 狗灵
...you have the Grim.

346
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:05,336
够灵？什么东西够灵啊？
The Grin? What's the Grin?

347
00:31:05,436 --> 00:31:08,425
不是够灵啦，笨蛋，是狗灵
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

348
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:10,760
长的就像一只大狗
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

349
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:13,412
那是最黑暗的邪恶预兆
It's among the darkest omens in our world.

350
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,608
那也代表着
It's an omen...

351
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,620
死亡
...of death."

352
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:26,076
狗灵是跟天狼星有关吧？
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?

353
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,157
老实说，罗恩，我觉得．．． 占卜学实在是很不精确的学问
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.

354
00:31:30,193 --> 00:31:33,977
我认为还是算命学 要比占卜学有趣多了
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.

355
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:37,257
算命学？ 你这学期到底修了多少课啊？
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?

356
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,030
只有一些而已啊
A fair few.

357
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,315
等一下，怎么可能？
Hang on. That's not possible.

358
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:44,285
算命学跟占卜学的上课时间 一模一样
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.

359
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,416
你必须同时间出现在两个教室耶
You have to be in two classes at once.

360
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:50,053
别傻了，罗恩 一个人怎么可能出现在两个教室
Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?

361
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,491
你要敞开心胸 用你的心灵之眼看见未来啊
" Broaden your minds. Use your lnner Eye to see the future."

362
00:31:55,483 --> 00:31:59,611
好了，各位同学，过来一点 不要再聊天了，好吗？
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer. Less talking, if you don't mind.

363
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,529
今天的课我为你们准备了好东西
I got a real treat for you today.

364
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,699
很值得看 跟我来
A great lesson. So follow me.

365
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:18,094
好了，不要再说话了 大家把队伍整好
Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there.

366
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:20,735
把课本翻到第49页
And open your books to page 49.

367
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:22,503
这本书要怎么开啊？
Exactly how do we do that?

368
00:32:22,643 --> 00:32:26,676
只要抚摸书脊就好啦 天啊
Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me.

369
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:39,850
-别这么没用，隆巴顿 -我没事
-Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. -I'm okay. Okay.

370
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:46,696
-我觉得很有趣 -有趣到吓死人，充满了智慧
-I think they're funny. -Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

371
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,373
这个地方越来越堕落了
Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.

372
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,287
等我爸知道这边有个笨蛋在教书 邓不利多就完了
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.

373
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,460
你住嘴，马份
Shut up, Malfoy.

374
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,067
催．．．催狂魔．．．
Dementor! Dementor!

375
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,190
你应该打他才对
-Just ignore him. -You're supposed to stroke it.

376
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,763
对
Yeah.

377
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,031
他是不是很美呀？
Isn't he beautiful?

378
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,820
大家一起来跟鸟嘴打个招呼吧
Say hello to Buckbeak.

379
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:43,643
海格，这是什么动物啊？
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

380
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:45,865
这种动物叫做鹰马
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

381
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:49,597
碰到他们的时候一定要记得 鹰马的个性非常骄傲
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.

382
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:53,725
也很容易生气 所以千万不要冒犯鹰马
Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

383
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,575
不然你这辈子就玩完了
It may be the last thing you ever do.

384
00:33:56,632 --> 00:34:00,178
谁想来跟他打招呼？
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?

385
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,718
很好，哈利，非常好
Well done, Harry. Well done.

386
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,901
过来呀
Come on now.

387
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:10,765
现在你
Now...

388
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:14,768
必须让鹰马采取主动 这样才有礼貌
...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So...

389
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,728
你往前一步，好好对他鞠躬
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

390
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:19,387
然后你再看他有没有回礼
Then you wait and see if he bows back.

391
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:21,672
如果他回礼了 你就可以放心的摸他了
If he does, you can go and touch him.

392
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:25,090
如果没有．．． 我们待会再说吧
If not-- Well, we'll get to that later.

393
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,740
现在跟他鞠躬
Just make your bow.

394
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:32,996
要很有礼貌
Nice and low.

395
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:40,005
后退，哈利，后退
Back off, Harry. Back off.

396
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,363
继续弯着腰
Keep still.

397
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:47,055
继续弯着腰
Keep still.

398
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:59,781
做得好，哈利，做得好 给你，大家伙
Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you.

399
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:04,728
好极了，你现在可以放心拍他了
Right. I think you can go and pat him now.

400
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,741
快点，别害羞
Go on. Don't be shy.

401
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:17,645
慢慢来，不要急，慢慢的来
Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow.

402
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:22,372
千万不要快
Not so fast, Harry.

403
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,789
慢慢地来 让他先靠近你，慢慢的．．．
Slow down, Harry. That's it....

404
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:34,155
慢慢来．．． 等他靠近你
Nice and slow. Now let him come to you.

405
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,324
慢慢的．．． 慢慢的．．．
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly....

406
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:40,302
就这样．．．
That's it....

407
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:42,253
好极了！
Yes!

408
00:35:42,801 --> 00:35:46,347
做得好，做得好，哈利！
Well done! Well done, Harry, well done!

409
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:48,447
还可以骑着飞一下吗？
Does he get to fly?

410
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:51,075
-我想他现在应该会让你骑了 -什么？
-I think he may let you ride him now. -What?

411
00:35:51,176 --> 00:35:52,765
-来吧 -嘿！嘿！嘿！
-Come on. -Hey, hey, hey!

412
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:56,175
来，我抱你上去 好好的享受这一趟旅行
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.

413
00:35:56,715 --> 00:36:01,270
不要扯掉他任何的羽毛 不然他会不高兴的
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.

414
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:45,690
太棒了，哈利 你也好棒，鸟嘴
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.

415
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:47,733
了不起，哈利
That was wicked, Harry!

416
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:49,312
这有什么！
Oh, please.

417
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:52,452
太棒了，太棒了
Well done, well done.

418
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,392
-我的第一堂课还可以吧？ -太棒了，教授
-How am I doing me first day? -Brilliant, professor.

419
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:04,043
其实你一点都不危险 你这个丑陋的大野兽
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!

420
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:05,526
马份
Malfoy, no....

421
00:38:06,372 --> 00:38:07,901
不要！
No!

422
00:38:08,574 --> 00:38:10,234
鸟嘴
Buckbeak!

423
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,593
哇！哇！哇！
Whoa, whoa, whoa....

424
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,552
鸟嘴
Whoa! Buckbeak!

425
00:38:16,616 --> 00:38:19,047
你这只大笨鸟
Away, you silly creature....

426
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:22,341
-我快被他杀了 -冷静一点，只是一点抓伤而已
-It's killed me! -Calm down. It's just a scratch!

427
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:23,700
海格
Hagrid!

428
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:29,243
-快把马份送到医院里 -没错，我是老师，我有责任
-He has to be taken to the hospital. -I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

429
00:38:32,097 --> 00:38:35,086
-我要你付出代价．．． -大家下课了
-You're gonna regret this. -Class dismissed!

430
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:37,494
你和那头鸡都要付出代价
You and your bloody chicken!

431
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:03,002
J哥，会不会很痛啊？
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

432
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,157
他只是啄了一下 我想我算是运气好
It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky.

433
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:10,639
庞芮夫人说如果再晚个一两分钟 我的手可能就要断掉了
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.

434
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,822
-现在我一个礼拜没办法做功课 -你们听这笨蛋说的
-I can't do homework for weeks. -Listen to the idiot.

435
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:18,385
-他还真会夸大其辞 -不过还好，海格没有被开除
-He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? -At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

436
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:22,297
可是我听说马份的爸爸很生气 这件事恐怕很难解决
I hear Draco's father's furious. We haven't heard the end of this.

437
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:24,254
-有人看到他了！ -看到谁？
-He's been sighted! -Who?

438
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,147
天狼星布莱克
Sirius Black!

439
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,269
达夫镇？那边离这里很近耶
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

440
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:33,292
你觉得他会来霍格华兹吗？
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?

441
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:35,953
-每个出入口都有催狂魔啊 -催狂魔
-With dementors at every entrance? -Dementors?

442
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:39,499
他们才让天狼星逃过一次 谁知道会不会让他逃过第二次
He slipped past them once. Who's to say he won't do it again?

443
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:44,282
没错，他可能在任何地方 要抓住他根本不可能
That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke.

444
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,198
就像用手去抓烟一样的不可能
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.

445
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:16,342
很好奇对不对？
Intriguing, isn't it?

446
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,382
有没有人要猜猜看
Would anyone like to venture a guess...

447
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:24,309
里面是什么？
...as to what is inside?

448
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:28,601
-是幻形怪对不对？ -非常好，汤玛斯先生
-That's a boggart, that is. -Very good, Mr. Thomas.

449
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:32,233
有人可以告诉我 幻形怪长得什么样子吗？
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?

450
00:40:32,312 --> 00:40:34,423
-没有人知道 -她什么时候来的？
-No one knows. -When did she get here?

451
00:40:34,581 --> 00:40:36,134
幻形怪可以变形
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

452
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:39,615
他们会变成某个人最害怕的东西
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.

453
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,310
-所以人们会觉得他们．．． -很可怕，没错．．．
-That's what makes them so-- -So terrifying, yes, yes, yes....

454
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:50,018
很幸运的 有个简单的咒语可以驱除幻形怪
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.

455
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:55,090
我们开始练习吧 大家先不要用魔杖
Let's practice it now. Without wands, please.

456
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,832
跟着我念，叱叱，荒唐
After me. Riddikulus!

457
00:40:57,937 --> 00:41:00,119
-叱叱，荒唐 -非常好
-Riddikulus! -Very good.

458
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:02,869
再大声一点，发音再清楚一点
A little louder and very clear. Listen:

459
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:05,263
听好，叱叱，荒唐
-Riddikulus! -Riddikulus!

460
00:41:05,377 --> 00:41:07,559
-这堂课还真荒唐 -好极了
-This class is ridiculous. -Very good.

461
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:11,841
其实也没那么简单 光是靠咒语还不足以对付他
So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.

462
00:41:11,883 --> 00:41:15,773
真正解决幻形怪的法宝是．．． 笑声
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.

463
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:20,391
你们必须强迫他变成一个．．． 你觉得好笑的形体
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.

464
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:24,697
我来说明 奈威，你出来示范一下好吗？
Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?

465
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:27,158
出来啊，不要害羞，来
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

466
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,832
来啊
Come on.

467
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:33,842
哈，奈威你觉得 什么东西最可怕？
Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?

468
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:35,635
斯内普教授
Professor Snape.

469
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:37,715
-什么？ -斯内普教授
-Sorry? -Professor Snape.

470
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:41,354
斯内普教授？对，他真的很可怕
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

471
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:46,064
-你是不是跟奶奶一起住啊 -是的，幻形怪变成我奶奶，我也害怕
-You live with your grandmother. -I don't want it to turn into her, either.

472
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:48,043
不会的
No...

473
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:51,700
我要你想像奶奶的衣服
...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.

474
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:55,189
只要衣服就好，在心里仔细想像
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.

475
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:58,483
她都拿着红色的包包 你不用说出来
-She carries a red handbag-- -We don't need to hear.

476
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:02,561
你只要想清楚了，我们就会看到 等我把衣橱打开以后
As long as you see it, we'll see it. Now, when I open that wardrobe...

477
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:06,037
我要你这么做．．． 不好意思
...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.

478
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:09,429
想着斯内普教授穿着奶奶的衣服
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.

479
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:11,273
有没有问题？
Can you do that?

480
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:14,618
魔杖准备好
Yes. Wand at the ready.

481
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:18,485
一、二、三
One, two, three.

482
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:30,103
快想奶奶
Think, Neville, think.

483
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,906
叱叱，荒唐
Riddikulus!

484
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,142
了不起，奈威，太棒了．．．
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay...

485
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:45,260
到后面去，大家排成一列
...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line....

486
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:52,766
排成一列
Form a line!

487
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,426
我要大家先在心里面想像 最害怕的东西
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...

488
00:42:56,484 --> 00:42:59,710
然后想成好笑的样子
...and turn it into something funny.

489
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,553
下一个，罗恩
Next! Ron!

490
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:08,401
专心一点，面对你的恐惧 勇敢一点
Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!

491
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,329
魔杖准备好
Wand at the ready, Ron.

492
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:23,917
叱叱，荒唐
Riddikulus!

493
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:25,432
你看吧，非常好
Yes!

494
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:29,001
太精采了，太精采了
You see? Very good, very good!

495
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:35,432
真是非常非常的有趣 芭蒂，该你了
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

496
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,277
让我们看看你想到什么
Show us what you see.

497
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:52,013
不要急，慢慢来
Keep your nerve. Steady.

498
00:43:52,036 --> 00:43:54,088
叱叱，荒唐
Riddikulus!

499
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,092
下一个，往前．．．
And next! Step up, step up!

500
00:43:58,109 --> 00:44:00,018
太赞了！太赞了！
Wonderful, wonderful!

501
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:16,140
我来！
Here!

502
00:44:21,932 --> 00:44:23,805
叱叱，荒唐
Riddikulus!

503
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:35,301
非常抱歉，今天的课就到此为止
Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today.

504
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,421
大家到后面拿自己的书
Collect your books from the back.

505
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:40,253
今天的课就到此为止，谢谢
That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry!

506
00:44:40,316 --> 00:44:43,471
抱歉了，大家不能练习得太过分 大家记住
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.

507
00:44:45,354 --> 00:44:50,146
大家记住 能够参观活米村是一种特权
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.

508
00:44:50,226 --> 00:44:53,180
如果你们的行为破坏了校誉的话
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school...

509
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:56,289
就没有办法再拥有这项特权了
...that privilege shall not be extended again.

510
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,038
家长没有签同意书的人 不可以去参观
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.

511
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:01,657
这是规定，波特
That's the rule, Potter.

512
00:45:01,837 --> 00:45:05,170
有同意书的人跟我来 没同意书的人留下
Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.

513
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:07,803
-只要你帮我签名，我就可以去了 -我不能签
I thought if you signed it, then I could--

514
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:10,474
只有家长或监护人才可以
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.

515
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:13,878
我两者都不是，我不能
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.

516
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:20,807
我很抱歉，就这么决定了
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.

517
00:45:21,856 --> 00:45:25,225
算了，没关系，待会见了
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

518
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:41,017
教授，我可以请教你问题吗？
Professor, can I ask you something?

519
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,173
-你要问为什么阻止你对付幻形怪吗？ -没错
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?

520
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:46,670
那是因为．．．
I thought it'd be obvious.

521
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,734
我以为．．． 幻形怪会变成佛地魔
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.

522
00:45:49,782 --> 00:45:53,423
我一开始的确是想到．．．佛地魔
I did think of Voldemort at first.

523
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:56,225
可是我又想到火车上的情形
But then I remembered that night on the train...

524
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:58,921
-想到催狂魔 -你很不错，这表示．．．
-...and the dementor. -I'm very impressed.

525
00:45:59,025 --> 00:46:02,014
你最恐惧的，其实是恐惧本身
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.

526
00:46:02,061 --> 00:46:03,614
真是充满了智慧
This is very wise.

527
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:05,875
我在昏倒之前
Before I fainted...

528
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:08,141
听到了一个声音
...I heard something.

529
00:46:08,601 --> 00:46:10,297
有个女人
A woman...

530
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,093
在尖叫
...screaming.

531
00:46:12,238 --> 00:46:15,607
催狂魔会强迫我们 回想起最恐怖的回忆
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.

532
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:18,735
我们的苦痛会成为他们的能量
Our pain becomes their power.

533
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,732
我想那是我母亲．．．
I think it was my mother...

534
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,137
被杀那晚的尖叫声
...the night she was murdered.

535
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:30,302
哈利，我第一眼看到你 就马上知道你是谁了
The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.

536
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:33,678
不是因为伤疤，而是你的眼睛
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

537
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,211
就跟你母亲莉莉一样
They're your mother, Lily's.

538
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,555
没错．．．
Yes.

539
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,948
没错，我认识她
Oh, yes. I knew her.

540
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:48,166
当所有的人都不理我的时候 只有你母亲肯帮我
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.

541
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:51,574
她不但是个充满天分的女巫
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch...

542
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:55,084
同时她还是个非常善良的女人
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.

543
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,636
不管什么时候 她总是能够看到别人的优点
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others...

544
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:05,111
甚至，她还能够帮助别人．．． 看到自己的优点
...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.

545
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,135
但是，你的父亲詹姆就不一样了
And your father, James, on the other hand...

546
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,781
他．．．
...he....

547
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,738
简直就是制造麻烦专家
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.

548
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:22,595
这个天份呢．．．我听说也遗传到你
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.

549
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,471
你非常像你的父母
You're more like them than you know, Harry.

550
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,440
慢慢的，你就会察觉到了
In time, you'll come to see just how much.

551
00:47:36,752 --> 00:47:41,343
蜂蜜公爵真是太棒了 但还是比不上桑科的恶作剧商店
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

552
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,989
我们一直都找不到时间去尖叫屋
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.

553
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:48,293
-你也知道那是全国最恐怖的鬼屋 -对，我知道
-You heard it's the most-- -Haunted building in Britain. I know.

554
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:51,050
怎么了？
What's going on?

555
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,704
大概是奈威又忘了通关密语了吧
Probably Neville forgot the password again.

556
00:47:53,768 --> 00:47:56,306
-喂！ -你在这啊
-Hey. -Oh, you're there.

557
00:47:56,371 --> 00:48:00,854
对不起，让我过去 不好意思，我是男生主席
Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

558
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,007
大家往后退
Get back, all of you.

559
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:07,407
在仔细搜查过之前 谁都不可以进宿舍
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.

560
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:08,835
胖女士，她不见了
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

561
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:13,458
真是太好了，她唱歌真可怕
Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.

562
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,502
这一点都不好笑，罗恩
It's not funny, Ron.

563
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:21,695
冷静，各位！分成四组 回到房间去
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room.

564
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:28,899
-安静 -借过
-Be quiet. -Make way.

565
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:31,182
-我是男生主席 -快点让开，让开
-The headmaster's here. -Come on, move.

566
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,252
我说了，让开
You heard. Move!

567
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:50,376
飞七先生，把幽灵都集合起来
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

568
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:54,860
我们要搜寻整个城堡寻找胖女士
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

569
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:58,084
教授，不用派幽灵去找了
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

570
00:48:58,798 --> 00:49:01,015
胖女士就在那里
The Fat Lady's there.

571
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,843
你们要去哪里，停下来
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

572
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:07,111
听我说，我是男生主席
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

573
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:09,707
-快点回来啦 -继续前进
-Come back here! -Keep moving!

574
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:16,200
亲爱的胖女士，是谁这样对你？
Dear lady, who did this to you?

575
00:49:17,982 --> 00:49:23,224
他的眼神就像恶魔一样恐怖 灵魂就跟他的人一样黑暗
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.

576
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:27,074
是他，校长 就是大家说的那个人
It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about.

577
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,698
他在这儿，在城堡里面
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

578
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:32,080
天狼星布莱克
Sirius Black!

579
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:37,543
飞七，封锁整个城堡 所有同学都到大厅去
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

580
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:10,499
我搜寻了天文塔还有猫头鹰房 但是什么都没有
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

581
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:13,168
-谢谢 -三楼也完全彻查过了
-Thank you. -The third floor's clear too, sir.

582
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:15,285
-很好 -我也搜过地牢了
-Very good. -I've done the dungeons.

583
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,145
天狼星不在那里 整座城堡都找不到他
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.

584
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:20,870
我想他应该不会在这儿逗留
I didn't really expect him to linger.

585
00:50:22,011 --> 00:50:24,442
他还真的很厉害
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

586
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,910
竟然可以一个人潜入霍格华兹
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...

587
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,757
-没有被人发现 -的确是很厉害
-...completely undetected? -Quite remarkable, yes.

588
00:50:29,851 --> 00:50:31,760
你能想到他是怎么做到的吗？
Any theories on how he managed it?

589
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:34,982
有很多方式，但是都行不通
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

590
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:36,713
您应该还记得
You may recall...

591
00:50:36,824 --> 00:50:39,778
学期开始之前 我对你聘用
...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns...

592
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,975
路平教授 感到非常担心
...about your appointment of Professor--

593
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:46,333
学校里所有的教授 都不会是天狼星的内应
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.

594
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,835
我想现在城堡已经安全了
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

595
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:52,687
所有同学都可以回自己学院去了
...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.

596
00:50:52,706 --> 00:50:55,137
那波特呢？要警告他吗？
What about Potter? Should he be warned?

597
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:57,981
或许吧，不过现在先让他睡一下
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

598
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:03,644
只要进入梦乡 就完全是属于自己的世界
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.

599
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:10,524
我们可以在深海里头悠游 也可以在云端上翱翔
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.

600
00:51:47,593 --> 00:51:51,068
翻到课本第394页
Turn to page 394.

601
00:52:00,372 --> 00:52:04,085
对不起，教授 请问路平教授怎么了？
Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?

602
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:08,225
这不关你的事，不是吗，波特？
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?

603
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:12,279
简单的说，你们的教授 目前暂时没有能力教导你们
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...

604
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:17,594
请翻开课本394页
...at the present time. Turn to page 394.

605
00:52:22,193 --> 00:52:23,960
狼人？
"Werewolves"?

606
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:27,076
可是教授．．． 我们才刚学到红软帽跟上哼即砰
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.

607
00:52:27,197 --> 00:52:30,458
-还要好几个礼拜才会教夜行动物 -安静
-We're not meant to start that for weeks. -Quiet.

608
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:33,831
她从哪冒出来的？ 你有看到她进来吗？
When did she come in? Did you see her come in?

609
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:37,978
你们谁能告诉我 化兽师．．．
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference...

610
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:40,580
跟狼人之间的差异
...between an Animagus and a werewolf?

611
00:52:41,177 --> 00:52:43,193
都不知道？
No one?

612
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:46,637
-真是令人失望 -我知道，教授
-How disappointing. -Please, sir.

613
00:52:46,715 --> 00:52:50,013
化兽师是自己选择变成狼的巫师
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.

614
00:52:50,052 --> 00:52:51,676
狼人他则是没有选择的
A werewolf has no choice.

615
00:52:52,021 --> 00:52:53,788
每到满月的时候他就会变身
With each full moon...

616
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:57,956
这时候他会忘了自己是谁 还会不知情的杀死最好的朋友
...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend.

617
00:52:57,993 --> 00:53:01,706
还有．．． 狼人他只会回应狼人的呼叫而已
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.

618
00:53:02,731 --> 00:53:05,613
谢谢你，马份先生
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time...

619
00:53:05,668 --> 00:53:08,099
格兰杰小姐 这是你第二次擅自发言
...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.

620
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,246
你就不能克制一点吗？
Are you incapable of restraining yourself...

621
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:13,813
还是你想当．．． 自以为了不起的万事通
...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?

622
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:17,520
-他还算有点道理 -葛莱分多扣五分
-He's got a point, you know. -Five points from Gryffindor.

623
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:22,370
为了治疗你们的狂妄自大 礼拜一早上之前
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...

624
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:26,238
要交给我两卷羊皮纸的狼人报告
...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...

625
00:53:26,254 --> 00:53:28,958
-主题要放在如何辨识狼人 -明天有魁地奇比赛
-...on recognizing it. -It's Quidditch tomorrow.

626
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:33,397
那我建议你最好特别小心 波特先生
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.

627
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:37,692
就算手摔断了也要交作业
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

628
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:41,658
翻到课本第394页
Page 394.

629
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:45,033
狼人这个名词
The term "werewolf"...

630
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:50,558
字源来自盎格鲁萨克逊 WERE这个字．．．
...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word " wer"...

631
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:55,737
代表“人” “狼人”的意思就是像人的狼
...which means "man," and "wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.

632
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:58,647
狼人的形成包括．．．
There are several ways to become a werewolf.

633
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:01,871
自己变形的．．．
They include being given the power of shape-shifting...

634
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:04,003
被狼人咬后变身
...being bitten by a werewolf....

635
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:26,526
-加油，哈利．．． -加油，哈利．．．
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

636
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:29,113
动作慢下来．．．
Aresto momentum!

637
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,492
-他看起来好虚弱喔 -虚弱？
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? -Peaky?

638
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,931
他这样已经不错了 他从一百英尺高掉下来耶
What do you expect? He fell over 1 00 feet.

639
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,992
把你从天文塔上丢下来 看你会变成什么德性
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.

640
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:43,263
搞不好会变得比现在帅
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

641
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,874
-你觉得怎么样？ -喔，还好啦
-How are you feeling? -Oh, brilliant.

642
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,000
你真的快把我们吓死了
You gave us a right good scare.

643
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:55,825
-发生什么事了？ -你从飞天扫帚上面掉下来
-What happened? -Well, you fell off your broom.

644
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:58,386
真的，那比赛呢，谁赢了？
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

645
00:57:02,728 --> 00:57:04,495
哈利，没有人会责怪你
No one blames you, Harry.

646
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:08,625
是催狂魔不该到比赛场地来的 邓不利多非常生气
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

647
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:10,845
他救了你之后 马上就叫催狂魔离开
After he saved you, he sent them off.

648
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:14,755
还有一件事要告诉你，哈利
There's something else you should know too.

649
00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:21,745
你掉下来之后，你的扫帚．．． 被吹到浑拼柳那里去
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and....

650
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:23,532
变成．．．这样
Well....

651
00:57:24,749 --> 00:57:27,145
我听说飞天扫帚的事情了
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.

652
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,090
真的没办法修好吗？
Is there no chance of fixing it?

653
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,611
没有
No.

654
00:57:31,722 --> 00:57:35,197
教授 为什么催狂魔对我影响这么大？
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?

655
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:38,685
我是说，其他人都不会这样
-I mean, more than everyone else? -Listen.

656
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:42,027
催狂魔是这世界上最恐怖的生物
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.

657
00:57:42,098 --> 00:57:46,510
他们会吸食人类的快乐泉源
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...

658
00:57:46,903 --> 00:57:51,659
直到一个人除了可怕的回忆之外 其他的一无所有
...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.

659
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:56,079
你一点也不软弱，哈利
You are not weak, Harry.

660
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,313
催狂魔对你的影响这么大 是因为你过去的经历太恐怖
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.

661
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,576
那是你的同学们无法想像的经历
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.

662
00:58:03,919 --> 00:58:06,315
你一点也不需要感到羞耻
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

663
00:58:06,422 --> 00:58:10,621
-可是我很害怕，教授 -只有傻瓜才不会害怕
-I'm scared, professor. -I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

664
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:14,267
我想知道该怎么击退他们 你可以教我
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me.

665
00:58:14,297 --> 00:58:16,373
你在火车上击退了催狂魔
You made the one on the train go away.

666
00:58:16,498 --> 00:58:18,336
因为只有一个催狂魔
There was only one that night.

667
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:23,326
-可是你赶走他了 -哈利，并不是我想要自抬身价
-But you made it go away. -I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

668
00:58:23,472 --> 00:58:28,610
既然催狂魔他对你这么有兴趣
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...

669
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,429
我的确是应该要教你 不过得等圣诞节之后
...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays.

670
00:58:32,448 --> 00:58:34,429
目前，我得好好休息
For now, I need to rest.

671
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:04,283
往活米村最后一次通知 现在快来
Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!

672
00:59:19,692 --> 00:59:21,768
-你们放开我啦．．． -你很机灵，哈利
-Guys, let me go. -Clever, Harry.

673
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,885
-不过还不够机灵 -幸好我们有好东西
-But not clever enough. -We've got a better way.

674
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,884
-拜托，我正在设法去活米村 -我们知道
-I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. -We know.

675
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:29,356
-别担心 -我们会帮你
We'll get you there.

676
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:32,137
-有一条特别捷径 -不过你要先冷静
-We'll show you a quicker way. -lf you pipe down.

677
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:35,953
-上帝保佑 -好啦，放开我啦，拜托
-Bless him. -Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't--

678
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:39,113
好了，哈利 加入大哥哥的阵容吧
-Now, Harry. -Come and join the big boys.

679
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:42,629
你们在干嘛？
What are you doing?!

680
00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:45,732
-这什么烂东西啊？ -他说这是烂东西耶
-What's this rubbish? -"What's this rubbish? " he says.

681
00:59:45,817 --> 00:59:49,256
-这可是我们成功的秘密喔 -送给你我们可是很心疼的
-It's the secret to our success. -It's a wrench giving it to you--

682
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,344
不过我们决定 你比我们还需要
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.

683
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,192
乔治，开始吧
George, if you will.

684
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:57,731
我在此郑重发誓，我绝不怀好意
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

685
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:04,980
在此月影、虫尾、兽足与鹿角．．．
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...

686
01:00:05,236 --> 01:00:08,331
荣誉推出劫盗地图
...are proud to present the Marauder's Map."

687
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:10,799
我们欠他们太多了
We owe them so much.

688
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:18,242
等一下，这是霍格华兹 还有这是．．．
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that--

689
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:21,094
-不会吧，这真的是．．． -邓不利多
-No. Is that really--? -Dumbledore.

690
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,182
-在书房里头 -踱步．．．
-ln his study. -Pacing.

691
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,430
他常这样
Does that a lot.

692
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,463
-这地图可以看到．．． -所有的人
-So this map shows--? -Everyone.

693
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,665
-他们在哪．．． -在做什么．．．
-Where they are. -What they're doing.

694
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:29,933
-任何时间．．． -每天都可以
-Every minute. -Every day.

695
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,179
-太棒了，你从哪儿弄来的？ -我们在一年级的时候
-Brilliant! Where did you get it? -From Filch's office.

696
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,227
-从飞七的办公室偷出来的 -在学校里面总共有七条密道
-First year. -There are seven secret passageways...

697
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,857
我们建议这一条．．．
-...out of the castle. -We'd recommend this one.

698
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:42,266
-独眼丑老女巫密道 -直通活米村
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway. -Leads you to Honeyduke's.

699
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,214
不过动作要快，飞七正往这边走
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

700
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,889
喔，不要忘了 等你用完之后，要拍一下然后说
And don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:

701
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,429
“恶作剧完成” 不然别人会看到里头的文字
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.

702
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:29,734
Now, how much do you want?

703
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:39,073
好吃
Delicious.

704
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,234
真不愧是全英国最恐怖的鬼屋 我有没有跟你说过？
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?

705
01:01:51,237 --> 01:01:53,004
两次了
Twice.

706
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:56,072
你要不要走近一点？
Do you want to move a bit closer?

707
01:01:56,176 --> 01:01:57,943
再接近尖叫屋一点啊
To the Shrieking Shack?

708
01:01:58,178 --> 01:02:01,167
不用了，我在这里就好了
Actually, I'm fine here.

709
01:02:01,213 --> 01:02:03,122
看看是谁在这啊
Well, well. Look who's here.

710
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,810
你正在看心中梦想的小屋吗？
You two shopping for your new dream home?

711
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:10,399
你应该买不起吧 你们全家不是都挤在同一个房间
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? Don't your family sleep in one room?

712
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:13,790
-闭嘴，马份 -真没礼貌
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy. -Not very friendly.

713
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:19,264
兄弟，我们该好好教教卫斯理 怎么尊重上流社会的人
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

714
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:22,846
-希望你不是在说你自己 -你没资格跟我说话
-Hope you don't mean yourself. -How dare you talk to me!

715
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:24,944
你这只可怜的麻种
You filthy little mudblood!

716
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:30,663
谁啊？
Who is that?

717
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:39,316
不要发呆，快帮我
-Don't stand there! Do something! -What?

718
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:01,395
怎么了，马份？雪橇掉了？
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

719
01:03:05,275 --> 01:03:06,769
滚开
Get out of the way!

720
01:03:07,178 --> 01:03:08,838
滚开
Move!

721
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:12,064
马份！等我！
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

722
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:17,735
哈利
Harry!

723
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:22,055
可恶啊，哈利 一点也不好玩
Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.

724
01:03:23,058 --> 01:03:26,427
他们两个坏蛋 从来没有跟我说劫盗地图的事
Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.

725
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,076
哈利，你不会留下地图吧 你会把地图交给麦教授
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.

726
01:03:30,165 --> 01:03:34,293
-对不对？ -是喔，还会连隐形斗篷一起交出去
-Aren't you? -Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.

727
01:03:34,304 --> 01:03:36,901
你们看这是谁，罗梅塔夫人耶
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

728
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,400
-罗恩在暗恋她喔 -别乱讲
-Ron fancies her. -That's not true!

729
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:41,419
-麦教授 -康尼留斯
-Professor McGonagall! -Cornelius!

730
01:03:41,543 --> 01:03:42,966
让我来，部长
Allow me, minister.

731
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:45,021
-哦，海格！ -抱歉了
-Oh, Hagrid.... -Sorry about that.

732
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:48,208
亲爱的罗梅塔，你的生意还好吧
Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good.

733
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:52,114
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...

734
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,690
如果魔法部不要每天晚上．．． 派催狂魔来我店里巡逻

735
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:56,890
-我的生意会好得不得了 -没法子．．．
-...into my pub every other night! -We have....

736
01:03:57,161 --> 01:04:00,494
-我们在追捕杀人犯 -天狼星布莱克在活米村
-We have a killer on the loose. -Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

737
01:04:00,697 --> 01:04:03,270
他来这里干什么？
And what would bring him here?

738
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:07,670
-哈利波特 -哈利波特？
-Harry Potter. -Harry Potter?

739
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:09,509
进去
Come.

740
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:14,051
哈利！
Harry!

741
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:26,334
-未成年的人今天不可以进来 -把门关起来
-No underage wizards allowed in today! -Shut the damn door!

742
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:28,430
-好没礼貌 -讨厌鬼
-So rude. -Thick heads.

743
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:30,249
-讨厌鬼？ -好大的胆！
-Thick heads?! -How dare they!

744
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:33,687
-他们在说你是讨厌鬼 -小鬼头
-Who are they calling thick heads? -Young whippersnappers!

745
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:38,395
催狂魔害得大家不敢来酒吧 除非他们想被吓得半死
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.

746
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:42,502
邓不利多教授根本不想这样 到处都是催狂魔
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.

747
01:04:45,103 --> 01:04:46,976
好吧，告诉我到底是怎么回事
Tell me what this is all about.

748
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:51,709
很多年以前，当哈利波特的父母 知道自己被追杀时
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death--

749
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:54,484
就躲到了一个地方 只有几个人知道他们在哪
Remember? They hid. Few knew where they were.

750
01:04:54,578 --> 01:04:58,575
包括了天狼星布莱克 但是他告诉了你知道的那个人
One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.

751
01:04:58,614 --> 01:05:01,983
天狼星那天晚上 不但带那个人找到了波特
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...

752
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:05,529
还杀了另一个好朋友彼得佩迪鲁
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

753
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,873
-谁是彼得佩迪鲁？ -他是个不起眼的小男孩
-Peter Pettigrew? -Little lump of a boy.

754
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,316
-老是跟在天狼星屁股后头 -我想起来了
-Always trailing after Black. -I remember.

755
01:05:10,392 --> 01:05:12,301
老是跟着他们
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.

756
01:05:12,393 --> 01:05:15,239
-这跟他有什么关系？ -彼得佩迪鲁想警告波特
-What happened? -Peter tried to warn the Potters...

757
01:05:15,296 --> 01:05:19,673
他本来可以成功的，要不是他 先去找了他们的好朋友天狼星布莱克
...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

758
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,697
天狼星非常邪恶 他不只杀了佩迪鲁
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew.

759
01:05:23,737 --> 01:05:25,990
他甚至毁尸灭迹
He destroyed him!

760
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:31,442
只剩手指，佩迪鲁只剩下一根手指 其他全没了
A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.

761
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:34,598
虽然不是天狼星亲自下手
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...

762
01:05:34,646 --> 01:05:38,015
-但波特夫妇却是因他而死 -现在他打算斩草除根
-...but he's the reason they're dead. -He wants to finish things.

763
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:41,036
-我不相信 -这还不是最糟糕的
-I don't believe it. -That's not the worst of it.

764
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,045
-还有什么更糟的 -天狼星布莱克．．．
-What could be worse? -This: Sirius Black was...

765
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:47,305
直到现在都还是．．．
...and remains to this day...

766
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:49,353
还是哈利波特的教父
...Harry Potter's godfather!

767
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:00,330
罗恩，你看
Ron, look!

768
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,644
-不好意思，借过．．． -圣诞快乐
-Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. -Merry Christmas.

769
01:06:46,976 --> 01:06:48,885
哈利，怎么了？
Harry, what happened?

770
01:06:51,312 --> 01:06:53,529
他是他们的好朋友
He was their friend...

771
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:56,273
但是他背叛他们
...and he betrayed them.

772
01:06:56,984 --> 01:06:59,036
他们是好朋友
He was their friend!

773
01:07:01,189 --> 01:07:03,241
我希望他赶快找到我
I hope he finds me.

774
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,222
到那个时候，我已经准备好了
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!

775
01:07:06,593 --> 01:07:09,297
等他来找我，我就杀了他
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

776
01:07:23,476 --> 01:07:25,172
哈利？
Harry.

777
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,305
你来了
There you are. You came.

778
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:31,677
你真的要学这个吗？ 这可是很高深的巫术
Are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic...

779
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:34,254
已经超过了普通巫术的等级
...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.

780
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:35,907
我要学
I'm sure.

781
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,992
一切都准备好了
Well, everything's prepared.

782
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,665
我现在要教你的这个咒语 叫做护法咒
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.

783
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,254
你有没有听过？
Did you ever hear of it?

784
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:46,090
没有啊
No? Well....

785
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:49,907
护法咒是一种正面的能量 召唤出这个法术的巫师
A Patronus is a positive force. For the wizard who conjures one...

786
01:07:49,931 --> 01:07:54,768
在面对催狂魔的时候 就等于有了一道屏障
...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.

787
01:07:54,768 --> 01:07:58,765
可是要施展这道巫术 必须想着快乐的回忆
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.

788
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:02,899
不是一般的回忆 必须非常快乐，非常有力的回忆
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.

789
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:06,904
你做得到吗？ 好，非常好
Can you do this? Yes. Very well.

790
01:08:07,946 --> 01:08:10,271
闭上你的眼睛
Close your eyes.

791
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:13,930
要专心
Concentrate.

792
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:17,268
探索你的过去
Explore your past.

793
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:19,632
有想起什么回忆吗？
Do you have a memory?

794
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:23,446
让自己充满回忆
Allow it to fill you up.

795
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,242
完全沉缅其中
Lose yourself within it.

796
01:08:26,462 --> 01:08:32,026
好，开始念这个咒语 疾疾，护法现身
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.

797
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:35,188
-疾疾，护法现身 -非常好
-Expecto Patronum. -Very good.

798
01:08:38,873 --> 01:08:42,348
好了吗？ 魔杖准备好
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

799
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:02,730
疾疾，护法现身
Expecto Patronum!

800
01:09:03,394 --> 01:09:06,904
疾疾．．．，疾疾．．．
Expecto.... Expecto....

801
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:08,799
疾疾．．．
Expect....

802
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:14,969
好了，来，坐好 深呼吸
Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths.

803
01:09:15,104 --> 01:09:19,066
没关系 没有人第一次练习就能学会
It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.

804
01:09:19,309 --> 01:09:24,659
那会是很不得了的成就 吃下去，你会觉得舒服一点
That would have been remarkable. Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

805
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,269
这个催狂魔好厉害 不
-That's one nasty dementor. -Oh, no, no, no.

806
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:31,231
这个只是幻形怪而已
That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.

807
01:09:31,285 --> 01:09:34,583
真的催狂魔比这个还恐怖 恐怖多了
The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse.

808
01:09:34,622 --> 01:09:37,362
我觉得很好奇，你刚刚在想什么
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?

809
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:41,280
你选用了什么愉快的回忆 我第一次骑飞天扫帚
-Which memory did you choose? -The first time I rode a broom.

810
01:09:42,329 --> 01:09:45,804
这回忆不够愉快，效果还不够强
That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.

811
01:09:52,538 --> 01:09:58,030
还有其他回忆 可是那不算．．．快乐的事
There's another. It's not happy, exactly.

812
01:09:59,744 --> 01:10:01,926
那是我．．．
Well, it is.

813
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:04,717
这辈子最快乐的回忆
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

814
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:08,909
-感受很复杂 -很强烈吗？
-...but it's complicated. -ls it strong?

815
01:10:13,122 --> 01:10:16,076
那我们来试试看吧 你准备好了吗？
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

816
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:19,561
开始吧
Just do it.

817
01:10:29,536 --> 01:10:32,940
疾疾，护法现身
Expecto Patronum!

818
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,168
疾疾，护法现身．．．
Expecto Patronum!

819
01:10:59,596 --> 01:11:00,734
太好了
Yes!

820
01:11:02,665 --> 01:11:06,211
哈利，做得好，做得好
Well done, Harry. Well done!

821
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:10,905
-我觉得今天的练习已经够了 -是啊，坐下来
-I think I've had enough for today. -Yes. Sit down. Here.

822
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:13,443
来，吃下去，你会比较舒服
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

823
01:11:13,509 --> 01:11:15,347
我得告诉你，哈利
And just so you know, Harry...

824
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:19,605
你刚刚的表现让我想起你父亲
...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that...

825
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:21,759
真的让我想起他了．．．
...is saying something.

826
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,926
我就是在想他
I was thinking of him.

827
01:11:26,019 --> 01:11:28,272
还有我妈
And Mum.

828
01:11:28,354 --> 01:11:30,679
回忆他们的样子
Seeing their faces.

829
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:34,034
还有他们跟我说话
They were talking to me.

830
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:36,453
不停的说话
Just talking.

831
01:11:36,528 --> 01:11:38,959
那是我选择的回忆
That's the memory I chose.

832
01:11:40,465 --> 01:11:43,038
我不知道那是不是真的
I don't even know if it's real.

833
01:11:43,434 --> 01:11:45,687
可是那是最好的
But it's the best I have.

834
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:57,239
-好美的天气 -是很美
-Beautiful day. -Gorgeous.

835
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,398
希望你没把他骨头拆掉
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

836
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,019
把骨头拆掉？这什么意思啊？
Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?

837
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:05,381
-罗恩的宠物老鼠不见了 -他才不是不见
-Ronald has lost his rat. -I haven't lost anything!

838
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,637
-是被你的猫杀了 -胡说
-Your cat killed him! -Rubbish.

839
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:11,197
你也知道她那头恐怖的猫
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

840
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:15,292
老是在附近跑来跑去 现在斑斑又不见了
...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.

841
01:12:15,295 --> 01:12:18,284
是你自己该学着照顾自己的宠物
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!

842
01:12:18,364 --> 01:12:20,510
-他被你的猫杀掉了 -才没有
-Your cat killed him! -Did not.

843
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,153
-你有 -才没有
-Did. -Didn't.

844
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:26,876
海格，听证会进行得怎样了？
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

845
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:30,378
这个嘛，一开始所有的成员
Well, first off, the committee members took turns...

846
01:12:30,408 --> 01:12:33,183
先说明开听证会的原因
...talking about why we were there.

847
01:12:34,946 --> 01:12:37,721
然后我起来说明，鸟嘴是．．．
I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak...

848
01:12:37,781 --> 01:12:40,876
很乖的一只鹰马 他都会把羽毛清干净
...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.

849
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:44,106
接着，鲁休斯马份就站起来 你们应该想像得到
And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine.

850
01:12:44,153 --> 01:12:47,486
他说鸟嘴是危险又致命的动物
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...

851
01:12:47,523 --> 01:12:50,713
看到任何人就想马上杀死对方
...who would kill you as soon as look at you.

852
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,665
结果呢？
And then?

853
01:12:53,294 --> 01:12:56,105
结果鲁休斯提出了最严厉的要求
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.

854
01:12:56,164 --> 01:13:00,470
-们不是要开除你吧 -不，我没有被开除
-They're not sacking you! -No, I'm not sacked.

855
01:13:02,403 --> 01:13:05,522
鸟嘴被判处死刑
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

856
01:13:32,262 --> 01:13:38,000
有蜘蛛．．．有．．．有蜘蛛 有蜘蛛，他们要我跳舞
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders. Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

857
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,632
-我不要跳舞 -你要对抗他们
-I don't wanna tap-dance! -You tell those spiders.

858
01:13:40,735 --> 01:13:44,863
喔，对，对抗他们 对抗他们，明天再对抗
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....

859
01:13:49,744 --> 01:13:52,282
(飞七)

860
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,006
(彼得佩迪鲁)

861
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,108
-彼得佩迪鲁？ -他是个不起眼的小男孩
-Peter Pettigrew/ -Little lump of a boy.

862
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:08,452
-老是跟在天狼星屁股后头 -天狼星非常邪恶
-Always trailing after Sirius Black. -Black was vicious.

863
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:11,100
他不只杀了佩迪鲁 他甚至毁尸灭迹
He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!

864
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:22,674
-把灯关掉 -对不起
-Put that light out! -Sorry.

865
01:14:31,746 --> 01:14:35,494
(哈利波特，彼得佩迪鲁)

866
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:50,933
(彼得佩迪鲁)

867
01:15:03,442 --> 01:15:04,995
(彼得佩迪鲁)

868
01:15:05,777 --> 01:15:10,083
-小心一点，同学 -我们还想要睡觉呢
-Watch it there, boy. -We're trying to sleep here!

869
01:15:13,951 --> 01:15:16,418
(斯内普)

870
01:15:18,121 --> 01:15:20,825
恶作剧完成，呐克斯
Mischief managed. Nox.

871
01:15:22,925 --> 01:15:24,312
波特
Potter.

872
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:28,066
怎么这么晚了还在走廊上游荡
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?

873
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:29,199
我在梦游
I was sleepwalking.

874
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,034
你还真的很像你爸爸
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.

875
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:37,103
你们一样傲慢无礼．．． 在学校里目中无人
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.

876
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:41,623
我爸他才没有目中无人 我也没有
My dad didn't strut. And nor do l.

877
01:15:42,175 --> 01:15:45,199
如果你不介意的话 请你把魔杖放低一点
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

878
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:50,719
把东西拿出来
Turn out your pockets.

879
01:15:52,312 --> 01:15:55,052
口袋的东西．．．拿出来
Turn out your pockets!

880
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:59,546
这是什么？
What's this?

881
01:15:59,652 --> 01:16:03,056
-用剩的羊皮纸 -真的吗？打开
-Spare bit of parchment. -Really? Open it.

882
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:13,241
把秘密现出来
Reveal your secrets.

883
01:16:16,968 --> 01:16:18,497
读出来
Read it.

884
01:16:20,871 --> 01:16:26,576
月影，虫尾，兽足与鹿角众位先生
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...

885
01:16:26,576 --> 01:16:30,847
在此大力赞赏斯内普教授 还有．．．
...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...."

886
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:32,532
继续念
Go on.

887
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:37,682
请他带着他的超级大鼻子走开 不要多管闲事
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."

888
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:40,387
-你这个傲慢无礼的．．． -教授
-You insolent little-- -Professor!

889
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,734
喔．．．喔，是路平
Well, well. Lupin.

890
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:49,690
你是出来散步，欣赏满月的吗？
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?

891
01:16:50,864 --> 01:16:53,402
哈利，你还好吧？
Harry, are you all right?

892
01:16:53,499 --> 01:16:56,072
恐怕很难说吧
That remains to be seen.

893
01:16:56,801 --> 01:17:00,691
我刚刚从波特身上 没收了一个很有趣的艺术品
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.

894
01:17:00,705 --> 01:17:04,382
你看看 这应该是属于你的专业领域
Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise.

895
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:09,379
-很明显的这跟黑魔法有关 -这恐怕不见得喔，教授
-Clearly, it's full of dark magic. -I seriously doubt it, Severus.

896
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:13,021
在我看来，这个羊皮纸卷 只是被设计成打算污辱所有．．．
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone...

897
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,083
设法阅读羊皮纸卷的人 我想这是从活米村买来的
...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product.

898
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,523
不过呢，我还是得检查 看看里头有没有什么黑暗力量
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.

899
01:17:21,524 --> 01:17:24,785
就如你说的，这是我的专业领域
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.

900
01:17:24,826 --> 01:17:28,301
哈利，请你跟我一起来好吗？ 晚安了，教授
Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.

901
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:37,014
你是聋子吗？把灯关掉啦
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

902
01:17:42,008 --> 01:17:43,502
进来
Come in.

903
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:50,648
我完全没有头绪 不知道这个地图怎么会在你手上
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession...

904
01:17:50,648 --> 01:17:55,286
不过说句老实话 我很惊讶你竟然没有把它交出来
...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.

905
01:17:55,286 --> 01:17:59,105
你难道没想过这地图 很可能来自．．．
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black...

906
01:17:59,156 --> 01:18:01,232
天狼星布莱克吗？
...is a map to you?

907
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:04,532
-没有 -没有，教授
-No. -No, sir.

908
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:09,583
你爸爸的确是很少遵守规则
Your father never set much store by the rules either.

909
01:18:09,665 --> 01:18:14,148
可是他跟你妈为了救你 而牺牲了自己的生命
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.

910
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:18,873
你夜晚在城堡游荡 等于是在冒生命危险
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...

911
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:23,499
让凶手对你有机可乘 这实在不是回报你父母的好方式
...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!

912
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:25,798
我下次不会再帮你掩饰了
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

913
01:18:25,879 --> 01:18:28,417
-听到了没有？ -听到了
-Do you hear me? -Yes, sir.

914
01:18:28,482 --> 01:18:32,301
我要你回到宿舍去，不准离开
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.

915
01:18:32,318 --> 01:18:37,288
不准再绕到别的地方去 如果你乱跑，我会知道的
And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.

916
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,386
教授，我必须告诉你 这个地图不是永远那么准确
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.

917
01:18:47,065 --> 01:18:52,212
刚刚地图指出一个人出现在城堡 可是我知道那个人已经死了
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.

918
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,282
真的？那个人是谁？
Oh, really? And who might that be?

919
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:56,963
彼得佩迪鲁
Peter Pettigrew.

920
01:18:59,509 --> 01:19:01,691
不可能啊
That's not possible.

921
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:04,543
我真的看到了
It's just what I saw.

922
01:19:07,317 --> 01:19:09,084
晚安，教授
Good night, professor.

923
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,856
敞开你的心胸 而目光一定要穿越现在
Broaden your minds. You must look beyond.

924
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:22,461
只有清澈的心灵之眼 才能看穿水晶球
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.

925
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:25,936
才能够看透未来，再试一次
Only then can you see. Try again.

926
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,515
这里出现了什么？
Now, what do we have here?

927
01:19:30,769 --> 01:19:33,057
可以让我试试看吗？
Do you mind me trying?

928
01:19:35,374 --> 01:19:38,469
好像是．．．狗灵
The Grim, possibly.

929
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:44,781
亲爱的 从你第一次踏进我这间教室开始
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...

930
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:48,707
我就知道其实你根本就不具备．．．
...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit...

931
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:52,819
学习这门高贵占卜学的灵魂 不信你看看
...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there.

932
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:56,641
你的外表是很年轻没错 但是内在的你
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled...

933
01:19:56,659 --> 01:20:00,822
却拥有老女人枯竭的灵魂 你的灵魂就跟书页一样的干枯
...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books...

934
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:04,091
再怎么努力也读不出未来
...to which you so desperately cleave.

935
01:20:19,478 --> 01:20:21,554
我说错话了吗？
Have I said something?

936
01:20:26,151 --> 01:20:31,321
赫敏她真的疯了 以前她从来没有这么不正常
She's gone mental, Hermione has. Not that she wasn't always mental...

937
01:20:31,322 --> 01:20:33,991
不过现在很明显 大家都看得出来
...but now it's in the open for everyone to see.

938
01:20:34,057 --> 01:20:36,310
等一下
Hang on.

939
01:20:36,426 --> 01:20:39,450
-我要把这拿回去 -我才不要回去咧
-We better take this back. -I'm not going back.

940
01:20:39,663 --> 01:20:43,209
-好吧，待会见 -待会见
-Fine. See you later. -See you.

941
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:26,324
哈利波特．．．
Harry Potter....

942
01:21:32,976 --> 01:21:37,412
-崔老妮教授 -他将会在今晚回来
-Professor Trelawney-- -He will return tonight.

943
01:21:37,413 --> 01:21:39,109
什么？
Sorry?

944
01:21:39,247 --> 01:21:44,051
今晚，那个背叛朋友的人 心灵被腐蚀的杀人凶手
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder...

945
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:46,163
会平安逃走
...shall break free.

946
01:21:46,253 --> 01:21:48,578
无辜的人会流下鲜血
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

947
01:21:48,656 --> 01:21:54,908
奴仆跟主人两个会再一次相逢
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.

948
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:04,403
对不起啊，孩子 你刚刚有说什么吗？
I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?

949
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,943
没有
No.

950
01:22:07,306 --> 01:22:08,930
没什么
Nothing.

951
01:23:01,452 --> 01:23:05,651
我真不敢相信他们要杀了鸟嘴 太可恶了
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

952
01:23:05,656 --> 01:23:08,502
-讨厌鬼来了 -我爸说
-lt just got worse. -What did I say? Father said...

953
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:12,899
我可以收藏鹰马的头 我想我会把头捐给葛莱分多的交谊厅
...I can keep the hippogriff's head. I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

954
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:15,468
这一定很好玩
This is going to be rich.

955
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:17,818
-看谁来了 -来参观处决的吗？
-Look who's here. -Come to see the show?

956
01:23:17,934 --> 01:23:21,160
你．．．这个笨蛋，讨人厌的笨蟑螂
You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

957
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,042
赫敏，不要
Hermione, no!

958
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,899
他不值得你动手
He's not worth it.

959
01:23:39,885 --> 01:23:42,031
马份，你没事吧？
Malfoy, are you okay?

960
01:23:42,154 --> 01:23:46,524
-快走．．． -别说出去！
-Let's go. Quick. -Not a word to anyone, understood?

961
01:23:46,524 --> 01:23:51,150
-感觉真好 -不是好，是爽呆了
-That felt good. -Not good, brilliant.

962
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:14,850
你们看看他 他最喜欢闻微风吹来的树木味道
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.

963
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:17,210
为什么不能偷偷放他走呢？
Why don't we just set him free?

964
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,823
他们会知道是我做的 然后邓不利多
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore...

965
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:23,007
就有麻烦了 邓不利多等会儿会来
...would get into trouble. He's coming down, Dumbledore.

966
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,525
他说他要陪我度过．．．
Says he wants to be with me when they....

967
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:28,538
度过那一刻
When it happens.

968
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:30,051
他真是个好人
Great man, Dumbledore.

969
01:24:30,997 --> 01:24:32,586
了不起的好人
A great man.

970
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:38,096
-海格，我们也会陪着你 -你们不可以这么做
-We'll stay with you too. -You'll do no such thing!

971
01:24:38,136 --> 01:24:41,434
不能让你们目睹那种事，不行
Think I want you seeing something like that? No.

972
01:24:41,507 --> 01:24:45,291
你们把茶喝完后就回去 在这之前，罗恩．．．
You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron....

973
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:55,050
斑斑，你还活着
Scabbers! You're alive!

974
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:58,974
-你要好好盯住自己的宠物 -我想这代表你必须跟某人道歉
-Keep a closer eye on your pet. -I think you owe someone an apology.

975
01:24:59,022 --> 01:25:02,912
下次看到歪腿的时候 我会跟他道歉的
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

976
01:25:02,925 --> 01:25:04,063
我是说我
I meant me!

977
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:07,015
天啊，是谁啊？
Blimey. What was that?

978
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,858
海格
Hagrid!

979
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:18,125
天啊
Oh, crikey.

980
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:22,386
不，部长，请走这边
No, minister. Over this way.

981
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:26,746
已经晚了，天快黑了 你们赶快走吧
It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here.

982
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:30,672
这么晚还被人发现在城堡外面 你们会有麻烦的
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

983
01:25:30,682 --> 01:25:34,430
尤其是你，哈利 我马上就来了
Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment!

984
01:25:35,687 --> 01:25:38,225
快走，快走
Quick. Quick!

985
01:25:38,289 --> 01:25:40,091
海格
Hagrid.

986
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:44,294
-一定会没事的，不会有事的 -快走
-lt'll be fine. It'll be okay. -Go on, go on!

987
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:48,879
-你们在那里看到的是石南树丛 -在斜坡上
-That's ling you see over there-- -On the slope.

988
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:51,708
-在斜坡上．．．海格 -邓不利多教授
-On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid. -Professor Dumbledore.

989
01:25:51,768 --> 01:25:54,579
-晚安 -部长，请到这边来
-Good evening. -Minister. Make your way through.

990
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:58,668
-要不要喝杯茶啊？ -不用，海格
-Have a tea, if you like. -No, Hagrid.

991
01:26:00,609 --> 01:26:03,278
-先生们 -我想喝杯茶
-Gentlemen. -I'd like a cup of tea.

992
01:26:03,378 --> 01:26:06,853
好，我们应该言归正传了吧 是不是？
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?

993
01:26:07,882 --> 01:26:11,630
委员会已经做出决定
Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...

994
01:26:11,652 --> 01:26:14,950
要除掉这头危险的生物
...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

995
01:26:14,989 --> 01:26:20,659
这个叫做鸟嘴的鹰马 今天日落前我们就必须处决
...hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.

996
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:24,336
-亲爱的，求求你．．． -海格，不要，别这样
-Dear, dear.... -Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

997
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:28,966
-好吧，就这样子 -处决即将于．．．
-All right. It'll be all right. -The execution shall dispatch--

998
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:30,768
怎么了？
What?

999
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:33,049
我刚刚好像看到．．．
I thought I just saw--

1000
01:26:33,136 --> 01:26:35,318
-没什么 -我们走吧
-Never mind. -Let's go!

1001
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,775
鸟嘴不会故意伤害人的
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

1002
01:27:29,186 --> 01:27:30,715
哦，不要
Oh, no.

1003
01:27:41,562 --> 01:27:43,850
他咬我，斑斑！
He bit me. Scabbers.

1004
01:27:44,366 --> 01:27:46,382
罗恩，罗恩
Ron. Ron!

1005
01:27:47,268 --> 01:27:50,945
-罗恩 -斑斑，快回来
-Ron! -Scabbers, come back.

1006
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:54,143
等一下
Wait!

1007
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:04,450
-斑斑，你咬我 -哈利，你知道这是什么树吗？
-Scabbers, you bit me! -Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1008
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,846
不妙了，罗恩快跑
That's not good. Ron, run!

1009
01:28:09,888 --> 01:28:12,520
哈利，赫敏，快跑
Harry, Hermione, run!

1010
01:28:12,991 --> 01:28:14,687
是狗灵
It's the Grim!

1011
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:24,821
-哈利 -罗恩．．．等一下
-Harry! -Ron! Ron, wait!

1012
01:28:24,901 --> 01:28:26,977
哈利
Harry!

1013
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,937
救我！
-Help! -Ron!

1014
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:36,378
-罗恩，罗恩 -罗恩！
-Ron. Ron. -Ron!

1015
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,167
快走
Come on!

1016
01:28:54,993 --> 01:28:56,487
闪开
Move!

1017
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:02,304
趴下
Duck!

1018
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:40,460
哈利！
Harry!

1019
01:29:56,281 --> 01:29:59,376
-对不起 -没关系
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Don't worry.

1020
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:03,520
-你觉得这里会通到哪里？ -我有个预感
-Where do you suppose this goes? -I have a hunch.

1021
01:30:03,887 --> 01:30:05,440
希望我错了
I just hope I'm wrong.

1022
01:30:25,072 --> 01:30:28,370
我们现在是在尖叫屋，对不对？
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

1023
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:31,002
来吧
Come on.

1024
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,778
罗恩
Ron.

1025
01:30:43,254 --> 01:30:45,994
-罗恩，你没事吧？ -那只狗在哪里？
-Ron. You're okay. -The dog. Where is it?

1026
01:30:46,089 --> 01:30:49,458
这是陷阱 他就是狗，他是化兽师
It's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.

1027
01:31:03,206 --> 01:31:06,088
你要杀哈利，得先把我们杀掉
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!

1028
01:31:06,141 --> 01:31:08,014
不，今天晚上只有一个人会死
No. Only one will die tonight.

1029
01:31:08,143 --> 01:31:10,159
那个人就是你
Then it'll be you!

1030
01:31:16,284 --> 01:31:18,537
你真的要杀我吗，哈利？
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1031
01:31:19,653 --> 01:31:21,562
去去，武器走
Expelliarmus!

1032
01:31:25,224 --> 01:31:29,565
天狼星啊天狼星！ 我们看起来好激动啊
Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1033
01:31:29,595 --> 01:31:32,750
我们终于能表达出疯狂的内在了
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.

1034
01:31:33,232 --> 01:31:37,016
你最了解疯狂的内在是什么样子 不是吗，路平？
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?

1035
01:31:47,277 --> 01:31:48,308
-我找到他了 -是的
-I found him. -I know.

1036
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:49,832
-他就在这里 -我了解
-He's here. -I understand.

1037
01:31:49,945 --> 01:31:53,278
-快把他杀了吧 -不，我那么地信任你
-Let's kill him! -No! I trusted you!

1038
01:31:53,582 --> 01:31:57,472
结果．．．你一直都在接应他
And all this time, you've been his friend.

1039
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:01,210
他是狼人，所以他才不能去上课
He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.

1040
01:32:03,892 --> 01:32:05,659
你什么时候知道的？
How long have you known?

1041
01:32:06,094 --> 01:32:09,427
写完斯内普教授规定的报告以后
-Since Professor Snape set the essay. -Well, Hermione.

1042
01:32:09,496 --> 01:32:12,556
你真是我所见过这个年纪里 最聪明的女巫
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.

1043
01:32:12,599 --> 01:32:15,101
不要再废话，路平，快把他杀了
Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!

1044
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:17,941
-等一下 -我已经等很久了
-Wait! -I did my waiting!

1045
01:32:18,004 --> 01:32:20,542
我在阿兹卡班．．．
Twelve years of it!

1046
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,542
等了十二年
In Azkaban!

1047
01:32:32,917 --> 01:32:34,719
好吧．．．那就杀吧
Very well. Kill him.

1048
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:39,145
可是你得再等一下 哈利有权利知道原因
But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.

1049
01:32:39,155 --> 01:32:40,779
我早就知道了
I know why.

1050
01:32:40,957 --> 01:32:43,282
他背叛了我爸妈
You betrayed my parents.

1051
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:46,418
-他们会死都是因为他 -不，哈利，那不是他
-You're the reason they're dead! -No, it wasn't him.

1052
01:32:46,461 --> 01:32:48,442
的确是有人背叛了你的父母
Somebody did betray your parents...

1053
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:52,170
可是一直到现在我们都以为．．． 那个人已经死了
...somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!

1054
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,838
-那个人是谁？ -彼得佩迪鲁
-Who was it, then? -Peter Pettigrew!

1055
01:32:55,869 --> 01:32:59,130
而他现在就在这里
And he's in this room! Right now!

1056
01:32:59,506 --> 01:33:02,601
出来．．．出来吧，彼得
Come out, come out, Peter!

1057
01:33:02,642 --> 01:33:05,761
-你现在可以出来了 -去去，武器走
-Come out, come out and play! -Expelliarmus!

1058
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:11,177
真是甜蜜的复仇
Vengeance is sweet.

1059
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,610
我多么希望能够亲手抓到你
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

1060
01:33:13,685 --> 01:33:15,072
斯内普
Severus--

1061
01:33:15,187 --> 01:33:20,090
我告诉邓不利多，你接应自己的 好朋友进入城堡，现在人赃俱获了
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1062
01:33:20,091 --> 01:33:21,478
太好了，斯内普
Brilliant, Snape.

1063
01:33:21,592 --> 01:33:26,183
你又再用你那鸡婆又敏感的内在 然后做出错误的结论
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.

1064
01:33:26,196 --> 01:33:28,971
如果你不在意的话 我跟路平还有事情
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business...

1065
01:33:29,031 --> 01:33:34,202
-要处理 -不要让我找到借口杀了你
-...to attend to. -Give me a reason. I beg you!

1066
01:33:34,203 --> 01:33:36,872
-斯内普，不要做蠢事 -他是笨蛋，专做蠢事
-Don't be a fool. -He can't help it. It's habit.

1067
01:33:37,006 --> 01:33:38,630
-闭嘴！ -你自己先闭嘴！
-Be quiet. -Be quiet yourself!

1068
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:41,278
看看你们，就像老夫老妻在斗嘴
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.

1069
01:33:41,344 --> 01:33:43,976
你干嘛不滚回去调配你的魔药
Run along and play with your chemistry set!

1070
01:33:44,412 --> 01:33:47,009
我现在就可以杀了你
I could do it, you know.

1071
01:33:47,382 --> 01:33:53,186
可是我不想浪费催狂魔 他是多么想．．．找到你
But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you.

1072
01:33:53,187 --> 01:33:55,998
你是不是怕得发抖了？
Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes.

1073
01:33:56,055 --> 01:33:59,696
催狂魔之吻，没有人能活著述说 那是多么恐怖的经历
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.

1074
01:33:59,726 --> 01:34:05,360
听说光是在旁边看都会让人受不了 不过我会忍耐！
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.

1075
01:34:05,365 --> 01:34:07,690
斯内普，不要这样
Severus, please.

1076
01:34:08,633 --> 01:34:10,709
你先请
After you.

1077
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:16,874
去去，武器走
Expelliarmus!

1078
01:34:18,575 --> 01:34:22,288
-哈利，你刚刚在做什么？ -你攻击学校老师！
-Harry! What did you just do? -You attacked a teacher!

1079
01:34:22,379 --> 01:34:25,048
-告诉我彼得佩迪鲁的事 -他跟我们一起上学！
-Tell me about Peter. -He was at school with us.

1080
01:34:25,114 --> 01:34:26,845
我们都把他当成是朋友
We thought he was our friend!

1081
01:34:26,949 --> 01:34:30,068
不对，佩迪鲁已经死了 是你杀死他的
-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! -No, he didn't.

1082
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:33,451
我本来也是这么想的 直到你在地图看到佩迪鲁的名字
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!

1083
01:34:33,554 --> 01:34:36,436
-地图在说谎 -地图从来不说谎！
-The map was lying, then. -The map never lies!

1084
01:34:36,524 --> 01:34:40,687
佩迪鲁还活着，而且他就在那里！
Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!

1085
01:34:40,962 --> 01:34:45,754
-我？他根本是疯了，我．．． -不是你，是你的老鼠！
-Me?! He's mental! -Not you! Your rat!

1086
01:34:45,832 --> 01:34:49,093
-斑斑当我们家的宠物已经有．．． -十二年了！
-Scabbers has been in my family for-- -Twelve years?

1087
01:34:49,135 --> 01:34:51,732
一般的宠物鼠怎么可能活这么久
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!

1088
01:34:51,804 --> 01:34:54,508
-他有一个趾头不见了，对不对？ -那又怎样！！
-He's missing a toe, isn't he? -So what?

1089
01:34:54,573 --> 01:34:57,668
-他们只找到彼得佩迪鲁的．．． -手指！
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his-- -Finger!

1090
01:34:57,742 --> 01:35:01,111
那个懦夫砍掉自己的指头 让大家以为他死了
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!

1091
01:35:01,146 --> 01:35:04,301
-然后再把自己变成一只老鼠 -证明给我看！
-And then he transformed into a rat! -Show me.

1092
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:09,974
-把斑斑交给他 -你们打算怎么对付他？！
-Give it to him, Ron. -What are you trying to do to him?

1093
01:35:10,054 --> 01:35:11,157
斑斑
Scabbers!

1094
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:14,478
快点放了他 你们在做什么，住手！
Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?

1095
01:35:36,844 --> 01:35:38,753
路平
Remus?

1096
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:41,000
天狼星
Sirius.

1097
01:35:41,114 --> 01:35:43,095
我的老朋友
My old friends!

1098
01:35:48,653 --> 01:35:52,650
哈利．．．你看看你 你长得好像你爸爸
Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father.

1099
01:35:52,657 --> 01:35:56,476
-好像詹姆，我们是好朋友 -你没有资格跟哈利说话
-James. We were the best of friends-- -How dare you speak to Harry!

1100
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:59,901
你竟然有胆子在他面前提起詹姆
How dare you talk about James in front of him!

1101
01:35:59,996 --> 01:36:05,367
-你把詹姆跟莉莉出卖给佛地魔 -我不是故意的
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! -I didn't mean to!

1102
01:36:05,367 --> 01:36:08,321
你不知道黑魔王拿什么来对付我
The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!

1103
01:36:08,405 --> 01:36:11,145
你呢，天狼星？换成你会怎么做
Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done?

1104
01:36:11,408 --> 01:36:17,244
-你碰上了会怎么做 -我宁愿死！宁愿死也不会背叛朋友
-What would you have done? -Died, rather than betray my friends!

1105
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:21,646
詹姆不会希望我被杀掉的
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!

1106
01:36:21,749 --> 01:36:27,657
你爸爸会原谅我的 他会怜悯我
Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy!

1107
01:36:27,921 --> 01:36:32,298
彼得你必须了解，如果佛地魔 没有杀了你，那我们也会联手杀了你
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1108
01:36:32,325 --> 01:36:34,436
不行
No!

1109
01:36:35,862 --> 01:36:39,990
-哈利，这个人他．．． -我知道他做了什么
-Harry, this man-- -I know what he is.

1110
01:36:39,999 --> 01:36:41,980
可是我们要先带他去城堡
But we'll take him to the castle.

1111
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:47,345
-上帝保佑你，上帝保佑 -滚开
-Bless you, boy. Bless you! -Get off!

1112
01:36:48,273 --> 01:36:50,775
我们现在带你去城堡
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1113
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,329
然后，让催狂魔处置你
After that, the dementors can have you.

1114
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:01,070
对不起，刚刚咬了你 我知道会有点痛

1115
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:04,760
有一点痛？何止痛啊？ 你刚刚差点把我的腿咬断了
A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!

1116
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:06,410
我是要追老鼠
I was going for the rat.

1117
01:37:06,522 --> 01:37:10,519
通常我变成狗以后都非常温驯
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.

1118
01:37:10,525 --> 01:37:15,930
事实上，詹姆不只一次建议我 干脆永远变成狗算了
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.

1119
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:21,007
我是可以忍受我长尾巴 不过跳蚤．．．真是受不了
The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder.

1120
01:37:33,377 --> 01:37:34,930
好了
Okay.

1121
01:37:39,884 --> 01:37:42,516
-你应该过去 -不用，不会有事的
-You better go. -No. Don't worry, okay?

1122
01:37:42,586 --> 01:37:44,044
我在这陪你
It's fine. I'll stay.

1123
01:37:44,755 --> 01:37:46,831
这里有我，去吧
You go, I'll stay.

1124
01:37:47,057 --> 01:37:50,318
-你可以吗？ -没问题，快去
-You okay? -I'm fine. Go.

1125
01:37:51,761 --> 01:37:54,880
-这一定很痛 -痛死了
-That looks really painful. -So painful.

1126
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,599
说不定会被截肢
They might chop it.

1127
01:37:57,966 --> 01:38:00,741
庞芮夫人很快就会治好的
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.

1128
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:05,178
来不及了，腿已经废了 我一定会被截肢
It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.

1129
01:38:06,273 --> 01:38:08,182
那里很美对不对？
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1130
01:38:08,942 --> 01:38:12,868
我永远不会忘记第一次 走进学校的感觉
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.

1131
01:38:13,413 --> 01:38:16,711
以自由之身再度走进去 感觉一定很好
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.

1132
01:38:18,717 --> 01:38:21,634
你刚刚的行为真的很高尚
That was a noble thing you did back there.

1133
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,573
他不值得我们动手
He doesn't deserve it.

1134
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:27,953
我只是想我爸一定不希望 他的两个好朋友
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends...

1135
01:38:27,992 --> 01:38:29,581
变成凶手
...to become killers.

1136
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:33,582
而且，他死了真相就无法大白
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.

1137
01:38:33,598 --> 01:38:36,065
他活着，你才能自由
Alive, you're free.

1138
01:38:36,133 --> 01:38:39,359
把我变成蛞蝓或者其他什么都好 只要不是催狂魔！
Turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors!

1139
01:38:39,436 --> 01:38:42,911
罗恩，我一直都是你的好朋友 好宠物？
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me...

1140
01:38:42,938 --> 01:38:45,535
你不会让他们把我交给催狂魔吧
...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat!

1141
01:38:45,608 --> 01:38:49,807
漂亮的女孩，聪明的女孩 你一定不会让他们．．．
-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't-- -Get away from her!

1142
01:38:52,114 --> 01:38:54,095
有件事我想你不知道
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1143
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:58,452
你出生的时候 詹姆跟莉莉让我当你的教父
...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.

1144
01:38:58,452 --> 01:39:00,468
我知道
I know.

1145
01:39:01,554 --> 01:39:05,788
如果你想跟你姨丈他们一起住 我可以理解
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1146
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:08,388
但如果你想有个新家，你可以．．．
...but if you ever wanted a different home....

1147
01:39:08,461 --> 01:39:11,058
什么？你要我跟你住？
What? Come and live with you?

1148
01:39:12,264 --> 01:39:15,490
其实这只是个想法 如果你不要的话那就算了
It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.

1149
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,406
哈利！
Harry!

1150
01:39:32,581 --> 01:39:36,436
路平，我的好朋友 你今天晚上没有吃药吗？
Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight?

1151
01:39:37,586 --> 01:39:43,150
不要忘了你是个男子汉，内在的你 才是真正的你，要记住你的心
You know the man you truly are, Remus! This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1152
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:46,368
外表只是假象
This flesh is only flesh!

1153
01:39:47,428 --> 01:39:49,610
去去，武器走
Expelliarmus!

1154
01:39:59,605 --> 01:40:01,229
哈利！
Harry!

1155
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:05,336
路平！
Remus! Remus!

1156
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:13,847
快跑，快跑
Run! Run!

1157
01:40:23,759 --> 01:40:25,870
-走了 -等一下
-Come on. -Wait. Wait.

1158
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:31,233
-赫敏 -不要啊．．．不要啊．．．
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1159
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,558
教授？
Professor?

1160
01:40:37,572 --> 01:40:39,161
路平教授？
Professor Lupin?

1161
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:50,248
乖狗狗，狗狗乖
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1162
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,182
波特，你在这里
There you are, Potter!

1163
01:41:26,881 --> 01:41:27,948
天狼星
Sirius!

1164
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,252
给我回来
Come back here, Potter!

1165
01:42:36,975 --> 01:42:38,433
天狼星
Sirius!

1166
01:42:39,178 --> 01:42:42,273
不要，天狼星
No. Sirius!

1167
01:43:24,016 --> 01:43:27,005
疾疾，护法现身
Expecto Patronum!

1168
01:45:39,668 --> 01:45:42,135
哈利？
Harry?

1169
01:45:42,971 --> 01:45:45,438
我看到我爸了
I saw my dad.

1170
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,164
什么？
What?

1171
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:48,896
他把催狂魔赶走了
He sent the dementors away.

1172
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,468
他在湖的另一边
I saw him across the lake.

1173
01:45:50,611 --> 01:45:52,307
他们把天狼星抓走了
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1174
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,434
催狂魔要去对他执行催狂魔之吻
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.

1175
01:45:55,482 --> 01:45:58,079
-你是说他们要杀了他？ -不，更糟糕
-They're gonna kill him? -No. It's worse.

1176
01:45:58,184 --> 01:46:00,093
糟糕透了
Much worse.

1177
01:46:00,186 --> 01:46:02,653
他们打算吸出他的灵魂
They're going to suck out his soul.

1178
01:46:04,255 --> 01:46:05,713
校长，你一定要阻止他们
Headmaster, stop them.

1179
01:46:05,825 --> 01:46:09,335
-他们抓错人了 -没有错，天狼星是无辜的
-They've got the wrong man. -It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1180
01:46:09,361 --> 01:46:11,649
-真正的凶手是斑斑 -斑斑？
-It's Scabbers who did it. -Scabbers?

1181
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,188
他是我的老鼠
He's my rat, sir.

1182
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:17,492
他不是真的老鼠 他以前是我哥哥派西的老鼠
He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat.

1183
01:46:17,534 --> 01:46:21,353
-可是他有了猫头鹰．．． -重点是，我们知道真相
-But then they gave him an owl-- -The point is, we know the truth.

1184
01:46:21,404 --> 01:46:24,001
-请相信我们 -我相信你们
-Please believe us. -I do, Miss Granger.

1185
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:29,774
可是很遗憾，世上没有人会相信 三个十三岁巫师所说的话
But the word of three 1 3-year-old wizards will convince few others.

1186
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:35,529
小孩所说的话就算是事实．．．
A child's voice, however honest and true...

1187
01:46:35,584 --> 01:46:39,510
也无足轻重 尤其是对那些不善聆听的人
...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.

1188
01:46:44,557 --> 01:46:47,189
神秘的时间啊
Mysterious thing, time.

1189
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:49,647
力量强大
Powerful...

1190
01:46:49,763 --> 01:46:52,787
尤其当一个人插手危险事物之时
...and when meddled with, dangerous.

1191
01:46:54,233 --> 01:46:58,017
天狼星被关在黑暗之塔 最高的牢房里
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.

1192
01:46:58,670 --> 01:47:00,852
你是知道规则的，格兰杰小姐
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1193
01:47:00,938 --> 01:47:02,811
不能被人看到
You must not be seen.

1194
01:47:02,908 --> 01:47:06,727
而我觉得你会成功 绝对能在最后一声钟响前赶回来
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.

1195
01:47:06,744 --> 01:47:10,421
如果失败的话，结果将十分恐怖
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.

1196
01:47:10,814 --> 01:47:12,687
但是，如果你成功了
If you succeed tonight...

1197
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:15,736
就可以拯救两条无辜的性命
...more than one innocent life may be spared.

1198
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:19,778
我想应该翻三次就够了
Three turns should do it, I think.

1199
01:47:24,559 --> 01:47:26,468
喔，对了
Oh, and by the way.

1200
01:47:26,561 --> 01:47:32,566
找不到方向时 我会循着自己的脚步从头再一次
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1201
01:47:32,566 --> 01:47:34,712
祝你好运
Good luck.

1202
01:47:35,135 --> 01:47:37,708
校长他刚刚到底在说些什么啊
What the bloody hell was that all about?

1203
01:47:38,271 --> 01:47:40,702
对不起，罗恩，你没办法走路
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk....

1204
01:48:09,599 --> 01:48:11,259
发生什么事了？
What just happened?

1205
01:48:11,365 --> 01:48:13,761
-罗恩人呢？ -现在七点半
-Where's Ron? -7:30.

1206
01:48:13,836 --> 01:48:15,780
我们七点半的时候在哪里？
Where were we at 7:30?

1207
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:17,743
我不知道，大概是海格那里吧
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1208
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,342
快走，我们不能被别人看到
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1209
01:48:21,308 --> 01:48:23,217
赫敏
Hermione!

1210
01:48:41,325 --> 01:48:44,100
赫敏．．．赫敏，等等
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1211
01:48:45,797 --> 01:48:49,510
-你可不可以告诉我怎么回事 -来参观处决的吗？
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?

1212
01:48:49,566 --> 01:48:52,520
你这个笨蛋，讨人厌的笨蟑螂
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

1213
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:53,956
那是我们耶
That's us.

1214
01:48:54,137 --> 01:48:57,161
赫敏，不要 他不值得你动手
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1215
01:48:57,273 --> 01:48:58,767
这感觉好奇怪喔
This is not normal.

1216
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:03,477
这叫做时光器，哈利
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1217
01:49:03,545 --> 01:49:05,833
是开学的时候，麦教授给我的
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1218
01:49:05,914 --> 01:49:09,424
这就是为什么我能同时上两堂课
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.

1219
01:49:09,483 --> 01:49:12,816
-你是说我们回到过去了 -对
-You mean we've gone back in time? -Yes.

1220
01:49:12,854 --> 01:49:16,364
邓不利多似乎是刻意让我们．．． 回到这个时间
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.

1221
01:49:18,526 --> 01:49:21,824
他一定是要我们来改变某件事情
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.

1222
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:26,217
打得好
Good punch.

1223
01:49:26,331 --> 01:49:27,884
谢了
Thanks.

1224
01:49:28,834 --> 01:49:30,565
马份要过来了
Malfoy's coming.

1225
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:33,833
-等等我 -谁都不准说出去
-Run. -Not a word to anyone, understood?

1226
01:49:34,206 --> 01:49:37,396
我一定让那麻种好看，给我记住
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.

1227
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,544
-感觉真好 -不是好，是爽呆了
-That felt good. -Not good, brilliant.

1228
01:49:42,747 --> 01:49:45,451
快点，我们应该去海格那了
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1229
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:07,133
你看，鸟嘴还活着耶
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1230
01:50:08,467 --> 01:50:10,448
当然啦
Of course.

1231
01:50:10,537 --> 01:50:12,613
你还记得邓不利多说的吗？
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1232
01:50:12,706 --> 01:50:16,905
他说如果成功了 就可以拯救两条无辜的性命
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.

1233
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:18,496
我们走吧
Let's go.

1234
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:41,911
他们来了 我们要快一点
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1235
01:50:41,998 --> 01:50:44,595
我们要先让夫子看到鸟嘴
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.

1236
01:50:44,667 --> 01:50:47,240
不然的话他会以为是海格放走的
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.

1237
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:50,672
斑斑，你还活着
Scabbers, you're alive!

1238
01:50:50,739 --> 01:50:53,621
-你要好好盯住．．． -那是彼得佩迪鲁
-Keep a closer eye on your pet. -That's Pettigrew.

1239
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:56,765
-哈利，不可以过去 -背叛我父母的人就在那里
-Harry, you can't. -He betrayed my parents.

1240
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:59,929
-你不会要我坐视不管吧 -没错，你非这样不可
-You don't expect me to sit here. -Yes, and you must!

1241
01:51:03,683 --> 01:51:06,529
哈利，你现在人是在海格的屋里
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1242
01:51:06,585 --> 01:51:09,539
如果你就这样闯进去 人们会觉得你疯掉了
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.

1243
01:51:09,588 --> 01:51:12,577
扰乱时间的巫师 是很容易发生可怕的事
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.

1244
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,985
我们绝对不能被人家看到
We can't be seen.

1245
01:51:18,162 --> 01:51:19,964
夫子来了
Fudge is coming.

1246
01:51:20,798 --> 01:51:22,980
我们不肯走？
And we aren't leaving?

1247
01:51:25,035 --> 01:51:26,695
为什么我们不走？
Why aren't we leaving?

1248
01:51:37,545 --> 01:51:39,169
你疯啦
Are you mad?

1249
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,542
那很痛耶
That hurt.

1250
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:48,075
对不起
Sorry.

1251
01:52:08,874 --> 01:52:11,649
我们要从后门出来了，快
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1252
01:52:28,957 --> 01:52:31,874
我的头发从后面看是这样子吗？
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?

1253
01:52:33,829 --> 01:52:35,216
怎么了？
What?

1254
01:52:36,029 --> 01:52:37,938
我刚刚好像看到．．．
I thought I just saw....

1255
01:52:38,066 --> 01:52:40,841
-没什么 -我们走吧
-Never mind. -Let's go.

1256
01:52:55,047 --> 01:52:57,443
走，哈利，走吧
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1257
01:53:03,588 --> 01:53:05,640
滚开，闪一边去
Get away. Get off.

1258
01:53:27,743 --> 01:53:31,289
部长，我觉得我也应该签名
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.

1259
01:53:32,013 --> 01:53:35,274
你能一起签名作证是再好不过了
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be....

1260
01:53:35,382 --> 01:53:39,308
好了，鸟嘴，快点来 跟我们一起走
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.

1261
01:53:43,622 --> 01:53:46,433
快拉，继续拉，快点
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1262
01:53:48,726 --> 01:53:52,688
鸟嘴，听话，快点好吗？
Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1263
01:53:53,330 --> 01:53:56,769
-签这条线上，签名字就行了 -我的名字很长啊
-Your name only. -It's such a very long name....

1264
01:53:57,034 --> 01:53:58,801
快点，鸟嘴，好吗？
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1265
01:54:01,438 --> 01:54:04,533
鸟嘴，快点来
Come on. Come on, Buckbeak.

1266
01:54:04,608 --> 01:54:07,004
有好吃的雪貂肉喔
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1267
01:54:09,545 --> 01:54:14,231
-快点来，这里，这里 -好了，部长，请跟我来
-Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky. -Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1268
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,981
-看到那边了没有？ -哪边？
-Now, look there. -Where?

1269
01:54:16,116 --> 01:54:19,626
-就在岩石过去 -你要我看什么？
-Look beyond the rocks. -What am I supposed to see?

1270
01:54:19,653 --> 01:54:23,294
迪平教授担任校长的时候 在那边种了石南
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.

1271
01:54:23,323 --> 01:54:26,277
-对．．．没错，没错 -还有那些草莓
-Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. -And all the strawberries.

1272
01:54:27,127 --> 01:54:30,116
-快点过来，鸟嘴 -我没看到草莓啊？
-Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. -I see no strawberries.

1273
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:31,372
就在那边
-Over there. -Where?

1274
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:33,335
-在那边 -往这里
-Over there. -This way.

1275
01:54:33,465 --> 01:54:36,240
-好了，我们来执行吧 -好吧
-Let's get this over, please. -All right.

1276
01:54:37,803 --> 01:54:39,570
他跑到哪儿去了？
But where is it?

1277
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:42,727
我刚刚还看到他
I saw the beast, just now.

1278
01:54:43,274 --> 01:54:45,562
-刚刚还在这里的 -真是太奇怪了
-Not a moment ago! -How extraordinary.

1279
01:54:45,642 --> 01:54:47,029
鸟嘴？
Buckbeak.

1280
01:54:47,178 --> 01:54:51,448
拜托，邓不利多 一定是有人把他放走了
Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him.

1281
01:54:51,448 --> 01:54:52,835
海格？
-Hagrid? -Buckbeak.

1282
01:54:52,981 --> 01:54:57,393
我想部长并不认为 你跟这件事情有关系
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.

1283
01:54:57,454 --> 01:55:00,408
怎么可能是你？ 你一直跟我们在一起
How could you? You've been with us all the time.

1284
01:55:00,457 --> 01:55:02,401
-是啊 -好啦，好啦
-Right. -Well, well....

1285
01:55:02,491 --> 01:55:04,080
我们一定要搜遍这一带
We must search the grounds.

1286
01:55:04,193 --> 01:55:07,348
我建议你应该搜寻天空，部长
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.

1287
01:55:07,396 --> 01:55:12,999
现在，我想来一杯好茶 或是一大杯白兰地
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.

1288
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,163
刽子手 现在你不需要执行任务了
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.

1289
01:55:17,171 --> 01:55:19,115
谢谢
Thank you.

1290
01:55:19,238 --> 01:55:22,677
教授，我这还真是没有小杯子
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.

1291
01:55:33,317 --> 01:55:34,870
-来吧 -这边
-Come on. -This way.

1292
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:43,463
跟我来
This way, now.

1293
01:55:45,828 --> 01:55:47,630
-接下来呢？ -我们要救天狼星
-Now what? -We save Sirius.

1294
01:55:47,763 --> 01:55:50,360
-怎么救？ -不知道
-How? -No idea.

1295
01:55:59,574 --> 01:56:02,041
-你看，是路平教授 -静止！
-Look. It's Lupin. -Immobulus!

1296
01:56:08,382 --> 01:56:10,458
斯内普来了
And Snape's coming.

1297
01:56:16,589 --> 01:56:18,320
我们只能等了
And now we wait.

1298
01:56:19,458 --> 01:56:21,331
我们只能等了
And now we wait.

1299
01:56:48,817 --> 01:56:52,221
-至少有人现在心情不错 -是的
-At least someone's enjoying himself. -Yeah.

1300
01:56:54,889 --> 01:56:56,727
-赫敏？ -什么事？
-Hermione? -Yeah?

1301
01:56:56,823 --> 01:57:01,327
刚刚．．．我跟天狼星在湖边的时候
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius...

1302
01:57:01,328 --> 01:57:03,545
我真的看到有人
...I did see someone.

1303
01:57:03,629 --> 01:57:07,211
那个人把催狂魔通通赶走了
That someone made the dementors go away.

1304
01:57:07,233 --> 01:57:08,620
那是用护法咒
With a Patronus.

1305
01:57:08,733 --> 01:57:10,714
我听到斯内普告诉邓不利多
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1306
01:57:10,802 --> 01:57:12,331
他的说法是．．．
According to him...

1307
01:57:12,438 --> 01:57:15,984
只有法力很强的巫师才能够做到
...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.

1308
01:57:16,007 --> 01:57:17,988
那是我爸
It was my dad.

1309
01:57:19,009 --> 01:57:20,882
召唤护法咒的人是我爸爸
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1310
01:57:20,978 --> 01:57:23,338
-可是哈利，你爸已经．．． -死了，我知道
-Harry, but your dad's-- -Dead. I know.

1311
01:57:24,648 --> 01:57:27,079
我只是告诉你我看到了什么
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1312
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,816
我们出来了
Here we come.

1313
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,893
看到我跟天狼星在那边说话吗？
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1314
01:57:40,962 --> 01:57:44,022
-他问我要不要跟他一起住 -很好啊
-He's asking me to come live with him. -That's great.

1315
01:57:44,065 --> 01:57:47,434
等他自由以后，我就．．． 再也不用回德思礼家了
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1316
01:57:47,468 --> 01:57:49,164
我们可以相依为命
It'll just be me and him.

1317
01:57:49,769 --> 01:57:51,785
我们可以住在乡下
We could live in the country...

1318
01:57:51,871 --> 01:57:54,611
一个看得到天空的地方
...someplace you can see the sky.

1319
01:57:54,674 --> 01:57:57,628
他被关了那么多年 一定很向往那里
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.

1320
01:57:58,544 --> 01:58:00,168
哈利！
Harry!

1321
01:58:01,647 --> 01:58:03,414
快跑！
Run!

1322
01:58:10,255 --> 01:58:11,844
我们走吧
Let's go.

1323
01:58:31,339 --> 01:58:33,770
-你在干嘛？ -我在救你啊
-What are you doing? -Saving your life.

1324
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:39,369
谢了
Thanks.

1325
01:58:41,148 --> 01:58:45,347
-这下好了，他来找我们了 -没错，我没想到这一点，快跑
-Great. Now he's coming for us. -Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1326
02:00:00,284 --> 02:00:02,122
刚刚好可怕
That was so scary.

1327
02:00:02,218 --> 02:00:05,278
可怜的路平教授今晚很不好过
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.

1328
02:00:16,597 --> 02:00:19,858
天狼星，快走
Sirius. Come on!

1329
02:00:35,748 --> 02:00:37,930
-真是太恐怖了 -别担心
-This is horrible. -Don't worry.

1330
02:00:38,015 --> 02:00:41,384
我爸爸会出现，他会召唤护法咒
My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus.

1331
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:51,869
他马上就会出现
Any minute now.

1332
02:00:51,995 --> 02:00:54,106
就在那边，你会看到的
Right there. You'll see.

1333
02:00:55,432 --> 02:00:58,029
哈利，听我说，没有人会出现的
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.

1334
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:00,732
别担心，他会来的，他一定会来
Don't worry, he will. He will come.

1335
02:01:04,774 --> 02:01:07,312
你快死了．．．
-Sirius. -You're dying...

1336
02:01:09,276 --> 02:01:11,220
天狼星也是
...both of you.

1337
02:01:13,214 --> 02:01:15,016
哈利！
Harry!

1338
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:20,883
疾疾，护法现身
Expecto Patronum!

1339
02:02:19,337 --> 02:02:20,961
你说得没错，赫敏
You were right, Hermione.

1340
02:02:21,073 --> 02:02:24,548
我看到的不是我爸爸，而是我
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!

1341
02:02:24,577 --> 02:02:27,459
我是看到我自己召唤出护法咒
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.

1342
02:02:27,512 --> 02:02:29,979
我知道我做得到了，因为．．．
I knew I could do it this time because...

1343
02:02:30,047 --> 02:02:31,814
我自己亲眼看到了
...well, I had already done it.

1344
02:02:31,915 --> 02:02:34,488
-这是不是很奇怪？ -没错
-Does that make sense? -No.

1345
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:37,504
可是我不喜欢飞行
But I don't like flying...!

1346
02:02:50,531 --> 02:02:51,918
咻咻碰
Bombarda!

1347
02:03:25,162 --> 02:03:28,079
我会永远感谢你们．．．
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1348
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:29,517
救了我一命
...to both of you.

1349
02:03:29,632 --> 02:03:32,692
-我要跟你一起走 -总有一天会的
-I want to go with you. -One day, perhaps.

1350
02:03:32,735 --> 02:03:35,759
我的人生实在是太过千变万化
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.

1351
02:03:35,803 --> 02:03:37,641
而且．．．
And besides...

1352
02:03:38,473 --> 02:03:41,912
-你应该留在这里 -可是你是无辜的
-...you're meant to be here. -But you're innocent.

1353
02:03:41,944 --> 02:03:44,161
你知道我是无辜的
And you know it.

1354
02:03:45,145 --> 02:03:47,126
我想这样已经够了
And for now, that will do.

1355
02:03:49,349 --> 02:03:52,018
这句话你大概听腻了
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1356
02:03:52,919 --> 02:03:55,551
不过你跟你爸爸真的很像
...but you look so like your father.

1357
02:03:57,188 --> 02:03:59,240
除了眼睛以外
Except your eyes.

1358
02:04:00,126 --> 02:04:02,522
-你的．．． -眼睛像妈妈
-You have-- -My mother's eyes.

1359
02:04:04,361 --> 02:04:09,675
造化弄人，我跟你父母朝夕相处 跟你相处的时间却这么短
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.

1360
02:04:10,067 --> 02:04:11,620
你要记住
But know this:

1361
02:04:12,670 --> 02:04:15,968
所有真心爱我们的人 都会在我们的身边
The ones that love us never really leave us.

1362
02:04:17,206 --> 02:04:19,258
他们永远会陪伴着你
And you can always find them...

1363
02:04:21,578 --> 02:04:23,522
在你心里
...in here.

1364
02:04:33,821 --> 02:04:36,453
你真的是同年龄里最聪明的女巫
You really are the brightest witch of your age.

1365
02:05:03,180 --> 02:05:04,876
我们必须走了
We have to go.

1366
02:05:33,072 --> 02:05:35,847
-什么事？ -他自由了，我们做到了
-Well? -He's free. We did it.

1367
02:05:35,908 --> 02:05:37,497
做了什么？
Did what?

1368
02:05:37,644 --> 02:05:39,660
晚安
Good night.

1369
02:05:48,353 --> 02:05:49,740
你们怎么冒出来的？
How did you get there?

1370
02:05:49,854 --> 02:05:52,629
我们刚刚才在这边讲话 现在人却在那边
I was talking to you there. And now you're there.

1371
02:05:52,857 --> 02:05:55,561
-他在说什么啊，哈利？ -我也不知道
-What's he talking about, Harry? -I don't know.

1372
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:59,337
说真的，一个人怎么可能 同时出现在两个地方
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?

1373
02:06:25,686 --> 02:06:27,239
你好，哈利
Hello, Harry.

1374
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:32,699
我看到你走过来了
I saw you coming.

1375
02:06:37,196 --> 02:06:40,007
我只是看起来不太好而已
I've looked worse, believe me.

1376
02:06:42,599 --> 02:06:45,897
-你被开除了？ -不对
-You've been sacked. -No.

1377
02:06:45,936 --> 02:06:49,031
不，我是主动辞职的
No. I resigned, actually.

1378
02:06:49,073 --> 02:06:50,911
辞职？为什么？
Resigned? Why?

1379
02:06:51,007 --> 02:06:56,479
因为好像有人把我的状况说出去
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.

1380
02:06:56,479 --> 02:07:02,150
明天这时候，就会有很多猫头鹰 送家长的抗议信来
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want...

1381
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:05,660
说不要像我这样的人 教导他们的孩子
...well, someone like me teaching their children.

1382
02:07:05,754 --> 02:07:07,735
-可是，邓不利多．．． -邓不利多
-But Dumbledore-- -He has already...

1383
02:07:07,822 --> 02:07:09,766
其实已经为我做够多了
...risked enough on my behalf.

1384
02:07:09,857 --> 02:07:13,261
更何况，像我这样的人．．．
Besides, people like me are....

1385
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:17,235
老实说，我也已经习惯了
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.

1386
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:29,307
哈利，你心情看起来好差
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1387
02:07:29,374 --> 02:07:31,627
一切都没有改变
None of it made any difference.

1388
02:07:31,743 --> 02:07:35,420
-佩迪鲁逃走了 -什么叫一切都没有改变？
-Pettigrew escaped. -Didn't make any difference?

1389
02:07:35,446 --> 02:07:39,087
你完全改变了一切 你揭露出事实真相
It made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth.

1390
02:07:39,117 --> 02:07:41,714
你让无辜的人免于恐怖的命运
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.

1391
02:07:41,985 --> 02:07:44,582
这实在是意义重大
It made a great deal of difference.

1392
02:07:49,125 --> 02:07:51,413
要说我有什么能引以为傲的
If I am proud of anything...

1393
02:07:51,494 --> 02:07:54,269
就是你这一年学到了很多
...it is of how much you have learned this year.

1394
02:07:54,330 --> 02:07:57,176
既然我已经不再是你老师了
Now, since I am no longer your teacher...

1395
02:07:57,265 --> 02:08:01,677
把这个东西还给你 我也就不会有罪恶感了
...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.

1396
02:08:02,402 --> 02:08:04,999
现在我们该说再见了，哈利
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1397
02:08:05,072 --> 02:08:07,776
我有预感我们一定会再见面
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1398
02:08:08,208 --> 02:08:09,595
一直到．．．
Until then...

1399
02:08:10,877 --> 02:08:12,644
恶作剧完成
...mischief managed.

1400
02:08:14,312 --> 02:08:17,016
(劫盗地图)

1401
02:08:46,842 --> 02:08:51,211
快点后退啦 你们不乖一点，我就把它拿回去
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.

1402
02:08:51,211 --> 02:08:52,669
哈利
Harry.

1403
02:08:53,446 --> 02:08:54,904
你怎么会有这个？
Wherever did you get it?

1404
02:08:55,016 --> 02:08:57,518
可以让我骑一下吗？ 当然你先骑了
Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course.

1405
02:08:57,585 --> 02:08:59,838
-你们在说什么？ -大家安静
-What are you talking about? -Quiet.

1406
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:03,359
让主角过来 我不是故意要打开的，哈利
Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1407
02:09:03,390 --> 02:09:05,987
可是这个包装得不太好 他们逼我打开的
It was badly wrapped. They made me do it.

1408
02:09:06,058 --> 02:09:07,611
才没有呢
Did not.

1409
02:09:08,928 --> 02:09:12,569
-火闪电耶 -这是最快的飞天扫帚
-It's a Firebolt. -It's the fastest broom in the world.

1410
02:09:12,597 --> 02:09:14,186
给我的吗？
For me?

1411
02:09:14,332 --> 02:09:16,964
-是谁寄来的？ -没有人知道
-But who sent it? -No one knows.

1412
02:09:17,035 --> 02:09:19,016
这是附在包裹上的
This came with it.

1413
02:09:23,774 --> 02:09:25,505
-快点！哈利 -对啊，让我们瞧瞧
-Go on, Harry! -Yeah, let's see.

1414
02:09:25,608 --> 02:09:27,517
哈利，它能飞多快？
How fast is it, Harry?

1415
02:09:46,794 --> 02:09:48,490
路摸思
Lumos.

1416
02:09:48,597 --> 02:09:51,099
我郑重发誓，我绝对不怀好意
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
