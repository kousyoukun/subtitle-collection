1
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:36,759
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,805
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,535
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,706
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,585
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,575
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,743
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,961
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,548
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:57,715 --> 00:01:59,049
What is it?

11
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,343
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,180
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:06,557
I will if she does.

14
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:09,852
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:12,897
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,024
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:19,528
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:24,074
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,035
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,496
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,623
Okay.

22
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,879
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,841
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,011
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,597
A bit more.

26
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,434
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:53,229
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,317
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:02,530
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,825
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:07,827
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:11,330
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:14,500
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,296
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,174
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:24,927
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,264
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,559
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:35,646
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,982
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:41,152
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:44,155
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,866
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:53,956
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,958
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,378
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:03,757
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,720
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:11,932
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:13,809
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:20,566
Right.

52
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,860
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:46,425
Vernon!

54
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,263
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:36,725
Stop!

56
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,856
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:45,317 --> 00:05:47,278
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:50,364
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,409
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,327
Oh, God.

61
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:57,288
Marge!

62
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,547
Please!

63
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,383
Marge!

64
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,637
Come back!

65
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,039
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:43,459
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,046
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:50,257
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:51,759
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,261
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,234
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:35,779
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:40,910
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:46,081
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,001
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

76
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,879
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,256
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:04,433
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,352
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,355
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,529
Come on.

82
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,166
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,184
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,603
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:03,576
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,247
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:11,375
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,878
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:16,839
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,887
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,805
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,516
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:32,313
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,616
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:46,535
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:48,996
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:50,998
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,167
Yes!

99
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:58,881
Who is that?

100
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,467
That man.

101
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,929
Who is that?

102
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:06,639
Who is...?

103
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,225
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,062
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,649
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:19,443
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,531
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,658
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:29,245
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,247
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,833
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,584
Yeah.

113
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:37,086
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:42,424
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,593
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,638
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,439
Mind your head.

118
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,280
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:06,657
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,915
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,757
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:27,761
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:33,476
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,501
Room 11.

125
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,421
Hedwig.

126
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:05,424
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:09,303
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,850
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:18,229
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:22,358
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:26,278
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:31,242
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,121
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,874
So that's that...

135
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,919
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,921
Pea soup?

137
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,215
No, thank you.

138
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,592
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,511
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,265
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:57,476
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:57,643 --> 00:14:00,187
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,696
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,323
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:15,327
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,329
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,248
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:26,380
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,717
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:32,845
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:37,016
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,147
Hedwig.

153
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:48,402
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:51,155
...wander.

155
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,618
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,448
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,121
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,130
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:35,009
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,261
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:40,431
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:43,142
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

163
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:45,853
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,439
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:50,232
Harry.

166
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:52,735
Harry.

167
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:56,989
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,534
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,913
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,249
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,835
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:11,420
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:13,714
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:15,299
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,635
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,136
- Got everything?
- Yes.

177
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,472
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,057
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

179
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:24,642
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,685
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:30,356
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:33,192
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,987
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:43,911
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:46,747
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:50,251
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:53,003
You are in danger.

188
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:56,131
Grave danger.

189
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:59,260
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:02,471
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:06,350
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,854
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,856
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,357
Sorry.

195
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,443
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,237
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:22,700
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,035
And in his mind...

199
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:28,205
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:32,126
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,461
And that is why...

202
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:37,173
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,216
To find you.

204
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:42,303
And kill me.

205
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:45,931
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:48,642
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,352
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,523
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:56,942
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,069
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,864
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,533
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:07,661
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:10,289
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:14,043
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,961
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,172
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:21,091
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,304
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,349
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,643
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,938
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,525
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,362
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,920
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,922
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,091
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,969
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:08,472
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:12,643
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:15,729
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:18,524
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,989
What's going on?

234
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:27,867
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:32,121
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:34,915
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,557
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:19,627
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,325
Harry.

240
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,245
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,086
Thank you.

242
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:47,715
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,342
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,726
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:02,313
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,191
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,986
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:16,494
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:23,626
What happened to me?

250
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,544
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:28,881
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,426
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:33,928
...you know...

254
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:37,181
...pass out?
- No.

255
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:39,058
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:39,225 --> 00:23:41,060
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,522
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:46,065
A woman.

259
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,026
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,964
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:54,216
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:58,721
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:02,141
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:04,768
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,438
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:10,149
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:18,073
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,910
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,747
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,916
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:29,460
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:31,545
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:35,466
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:35,674 --> 00:25:38,385
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:41,388
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:45,893
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,949
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:02,660
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:08,040
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:12,169
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:13,128 --> 00:26:16,799
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,634
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:22,471
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:23,973
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,351
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:30,938
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:34,733
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,529
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,410
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:49,832
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:53,627
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:58,716
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:12,730
Fortuna Major.

294
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,235
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,363
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

296
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,365
Watch this.

297
00:27:34,126 --> 00:27:39,089
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

298
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:42,843
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,847
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,183
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:52,561
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:54,980
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,108
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,571
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,949
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:07,743
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:16,585
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:23,884
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:27,179
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,307
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:16,187
Welcome, my children.

312
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:21,484
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,947
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:32,328
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:37,124
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:41,170
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:44,924
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:46,801
What do you see?

319
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:52,640
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:55,267
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:59,980
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:02,066
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,902
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,363
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,490
I think so.

326
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:12,451
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:16,831
Pity.

328
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,667
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,590
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,676
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:31,095
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,972
Yeah.

333
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:38,227
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:42,314
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:43,858
So...

336
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:48,070
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,613
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:54,076
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:57,830
My dear...

340
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:02,585
...you have the Grim.

341
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,171
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:08,215
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:08,382 --> 00:31:10,551
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,220
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:15,431
It's an omen...

346
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:17,433
...of death."

347
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:25,774
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:29,904
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,741
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:37,036
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,871
A fair few.

352
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,123
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,084
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,253
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,799
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:49,965 --> 00:31:54,220
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:55,387 --> 00:31:59,350
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,352
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,521
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:14,782 --> 00:32:17,868
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,538
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:22,331
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,418
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:39,598
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:46,480
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:49,150
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:53,028
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,322
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:11,881
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:22,975
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:23,142 --> 00:33:24,602
Yeah.

372
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,823
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,618
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:43,454
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:45,706
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:49,376
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:49,585 --> 00:33:53,464
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,383
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,929
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,558
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:08,729
Come on now.

382
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:10,606
Now...

383
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,527
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:16,570
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:19,198
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:21,492
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,870
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,583
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,837
Nice and low.

390
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:39,844
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,222
Keep still.

392
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,892
Keep still.

393
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:59,488
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:04,535
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:06,579
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:17,465
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:22,219
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,561
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:33,939
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:38,152
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,154
That's it...

402
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,114
Yes!

403
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:46,118
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,287
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,873
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:52,625
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:55,961
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:56,629 --> 00:36:01,008
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:41,942 --> 00:37:45,446
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,573
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,158
Oh, please.

412
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,286
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:56,165
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:03,798
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:05,382
Malfoy, no...

416
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,760
No!

417
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,095
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:12,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

419
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,392
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,854
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,149
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:23,567
Hagrid!

423
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:28,948
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:34,870
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:37,331
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:02,857
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:06,902
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:10,406
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,617
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:18,122
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,042
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,086
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:26,005
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:30,050
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,095
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:33,262 --> 00:39:35,764
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:39,268
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:44,023
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,985
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:16,180
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:22,186
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,146
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:28,359
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:32,029
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:32,238 --> 00:40:34,281
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,991
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,411
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,041
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,713
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:54,844
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:55,136 --> 00:40:57,638
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,974
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

453
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:02,685
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,104
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

455
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:07,398
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:11,610
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,531
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:20,161
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:24,456
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:27,001
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,670
Come on.

462
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:33,632
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:35,509
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:35,718 --> 00:41:37,553
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,140
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:45,811
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:47,897
No...

468
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:51,525
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,987
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:58,282
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:02,328
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:05,831
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,210
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:09,418 --> 00:42:11,128
Can you do that?

475
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:14,423
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:18,260
One, two, three.

477
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:29,939
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,735
Riddikulus!

479
00:42:39,281 --> 00:42:41,951
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,079
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:52,628
Form a line!

482
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:56,215
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:59,510
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:01,428
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,185
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,198
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,784
Riddikulus!

488
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:25,286
Yes!

489
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:28,789
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:35,129
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:39,133
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,812
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:53,939
Riddikulus!

494
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:56,942
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:58,027 --> 00:43:59,862
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,003
Here!

497
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,677
Riddikulus!

498
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:35,105
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,274
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,069
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:43,280
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:49,870
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:50,162 --> 00:44:52,998
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:56,085
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:59,839
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:01,549
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:45:01,757 --> 00:45:04,969
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,638
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,307
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,686
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,568
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:21,777 --> 00:45:25,030
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,880
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:44,925
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:45,134 --> 00:45:46,552
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,555
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:49,722 --> 00:45:53,225
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,061
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:56,228 --> 00:45:58,772
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:01,817
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:03,486
This is very wise.

522
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,738
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:05,988 --> 00:46:07,990
...I heard something.

524
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,159
A woman...

525
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:11,952
...screaming.

526
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:15,414
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:15,623 --> 00:46:18,542
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,587
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:21,754 --> 00:46:23,964
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:30,054
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:33,474
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,060
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,437
Yes.

534
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:41,774
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:47,947
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:51,367
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:54,870
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:58,457
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:58,624 --> 00:47:04,797
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:08,968
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:10,678
...he...

542
00:47:11,178 --> 00:47:14,515
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:22,314
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,280
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:33,242
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:41,083
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,836
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:44,003 --> 00:47:48,048
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:50,926
What's going on?

550
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:53,554
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:56,140
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:56,307 --> 00:48:00,603
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:03,898
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:07,234
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:07,401 --> 00:48:08,736
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,282
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:13,449 --> 00:48:15,367
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,457
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:27,797 --> 00:48:28,839
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:48:29,048 --> 00:48:31,008
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:48:31,217 --> 00:48:33,093
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:47,316 --> 00:48:50,194
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:54,615
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:57,910
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:00,871
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,707
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,961
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,547
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:16,011
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,977
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,897
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,525
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:29,775 --> 00:49:31,944
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:37,283
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:10,274
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:13,027
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:15,154
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:17,990
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:20,701
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,288
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,749
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,585
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31,629
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:34,799
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:36,592
You may recall...

586
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:39,595
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:41,847
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:50:42,014 --> 00:50:46,101
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:48,687
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:50:48,854 --> 00:50:52,483
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,985
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:55,194 --> 00:50:57,822
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:58,697 --> 00:51:03,410
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:10,209
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:50,875
Turn to page 394.

596
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:03,888
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:04,597 --> 00:52:08,017
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:08,184 --> 00:52:12,062
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:17,318
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:22,156 --> 00:52:23,824
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:26,911
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:30,289
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:52:30,498 --> 00:52:33,667
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:34,293 --> 00:52:37,797
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:40,424
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,052
No one?

607
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:46,472
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,850
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:51,560
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:53,687
With each full moon...

611
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:57,733
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,529
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,449
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:07,952
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,121
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,624
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:17,336
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:22,133
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:26,053
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,806
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,227
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:37,481
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,443
Page 394.

624
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:44,905
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:50,327
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,499
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,502
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:01,714
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:54:01,964 --> 00:54:03,883
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:26,322
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:28,944
Aresto momentum!

632
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:34,325
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:36,786
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:39,830
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,083
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:46,754 --> 00:56:49,715
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:51,884
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:56:52,134 --> 00:56:55,638
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,265
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,396
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:04,605 --> 00:57:08,442
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,736
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:14,573
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:21,455
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:21,956 --> 00:57:23,457
Well...

646
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,002
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:29,964
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:30,131 --> 00:57:31,507
No.

649
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:35,010
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:38,514
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:41,851
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:46,313
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:51,443
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:51,652 --> 00:57:55,865
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:56,031 --> 00:58:00,119
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:03,414
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:06,167
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:10,421
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:14,091
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:16,260
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:18,220
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:18,512 --> 00:58:23,100
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:28,397
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:32,234
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:34,320
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:04,058
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,659
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:24,745
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

669
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:27,748
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:29,125
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32,002
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

672
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:35,756
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:59:36,382 --> 00:59:38,968
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:42,513
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:42,763 --> 00:59:45,599
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:59:45,766 --> 00:59:49,103
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

677
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,189
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:54,108
George, if you will.

679
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:57,570
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:04,785
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,164
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:08,414 --> 01:00:10,666
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:18,048
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:20,676
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:22,178
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:24,305
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:24,513 --> 01:00:26,348
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

688
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:28,559
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:29,852
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:33,022
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

691
01:00:33,189 --> 01:00:35,941
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:38,777
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:42,114
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
01:00:42,281 --> 01:00:44,116
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:44,283 --> 01:00:47,703
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:52,208
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,745
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:37,044 --> 01:01:38,963
Delicious.

699
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:51,058
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:51,225 --> 01:01:52,893
Twice.

701
01:01:53,602 --> 01:01:55,938
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,857
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:58,149 --> 01:02:01,026
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:02:01,193 --> 01:02:03,028
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:02:03,404 --> 01:02:05,698
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:10,202
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:10,411 --> 01:02:13,622
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:19,044
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:19,253 --> 01:02:22,673
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,842
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:29,054 --> 01:02:30,598
Who is that?

712
01:02:36,812 --> 01:02:39,190
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:01,295
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:05,257 --> 01:03:06,675
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:08,469
Move!

716
01:03:08,928 --> 01:03:11,931
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:15,684 --> 01:03:17,645
Harry!

718
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:21,857
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:23,025 --> 01:03:26,278
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:29,907
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:34,120
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:34,286 --> 01:03:36,789
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:36,997 --> 01:03:39,291
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,335
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:41,502 --> 01:03:42,878
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:44,922
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:48,050
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:52,138
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:52,304 --> 01:03:56,350
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,979
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:04:00,312 --> 01:04:02,773
And what would bring him here?

732
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,111
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

733
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:09,029
Come.

734
01:04:11,574 --> 01:04:13,576
Harry!

735
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:25,754
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,965
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:04:28,215 --> 01:04:29,800
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:33,179
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:37,850
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:38,017 --> 01:04:41,937
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:44,732 --> 01:04:46,525
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:46,692 --> 01:04:51,155
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:53,991
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,037
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:58,245 --> 01:05:01,457
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:05,002
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:07,421
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:07,588 --> 01:05:09,840
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

749
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:11,842
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:14,762
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:19,099
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:19,308 --> 01:05:23,145
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,523
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:30,903
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:34,115
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:37,493
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

757
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:40,538
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:44,500
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,836
...and remains to this day...

760
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:48,921
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:57,555 --> 01:05:59,849
Ron, look!

762
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:08,149
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:46,604 --> 01:06:48,439
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:53,068
He was their friend...

765
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,821
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:58,574
He was their friend!

767
01:07:00,826 --> 01:07:02,787
I hope he finds me.

768
01:07:03,412 --> 01:07:05,748
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:06,207 --> 01:07:08,834
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:23,098 --> 01:07:24,725
Harry.

771
01:07:25,226 --> 01:07:26,894
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:31,148
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:33,776
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:33,943 --> 01:07:35,486
I'm sure.

775
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:38,531
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:42,159
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:43,828
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:43,994 --> 01:07:45,663
No? Well...

779
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:49,416
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:54,255
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:54,421 --> 01:07:58,259
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:58,425 --> 01:08:02,388
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:08:02,596 --> 01:08:06,392
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:09,812
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:13,482
Concentrate.

786
01:08:14,733 --> 01:08:16,819
Explore your past.

787
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,196
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,992
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:23,701 --> 01:08:25,786
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:31,459
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:34,712
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.

792
01:08:38,507 --> 01:08:41,844
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:02,281
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,410
Expecto... Expecto...

795
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,370
Expect...

796
01:09:10,372 --> 01:09:14,460
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:14,752 --> 01:09:18,547
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:24,094
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:27,807
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:28,015 --> 01:09:30,768
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:30,935 --> 01:09:34,104
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,899
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:37,066 --> 01:09:40,778
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:41,987 --> 01:09:45,324
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:52,206 --> 01:09:57,461
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,507
Well, it is.

807
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:04,260
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:04,426 --> 01:10:08,389
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:15,604
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:10:17,398 --> 01:10:19,150
Just do it.

811
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:32,455
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:37,668
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:10:59,273 --> 01:11:00,357
Yes!

814
01:11:02,318 --> 01:11:05,738
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,409
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:12,995
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:14,955
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:15,122 --> 01:11:19,126
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:21,337
...is saying something.

820
01:11:23,506 --> 01:11:25,508
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:25,674 --> 01:11:27,843
And Mum.

822
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,262
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:33,599
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:33,766 --> 01:11:36,018
Just talking.

825
01:11:36,185 --> 01:11:38,521
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:40,147 --> 01:11:42,608
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:43,108 --> 01:11:45,277
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:54,495 --> 01:11:56,831
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:56,997 --> 01:11:58,999
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,585
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:04,922
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:07,216
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:12:07,383 --> 01:12:10,719
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:14,807
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:14,974 --> 01:12:17,852
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:18,018 --> 01:12:20,104
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:21,772
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:12:23,816 --> 01:12:26,443
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,905
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:32,741
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:34,618 --> 01:12:37,288
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:37,455 --> 01:12:40,416
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:43,669
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:47,047
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:50,259
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:50,468 --> 01:12:52,261
And then?

847
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,681
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:55,848 --> 01:12:59,977
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:05,065
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:37,473
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:40,226
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

852
01:13:40,434 --> 01:13:44,396
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:04,708
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

854
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:08,003
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

855
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:10,673
He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

856
01:14:18,764 --> 01:14:22,226
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:15:05,478 --> 01:15:09,607
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:17,823 --> 01:15:20,409
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,954
Potter.

860
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:27,625
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:28,959
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:31,670
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:31,837 --> 01:15:36,592
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:41,138
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:44,975
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:50,397
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:52,107 --> 01:15:54,693
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:57,655 --> 01:15:59,281
What's this?

869
01:15:59,448 --> 01:16:02,701
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:12,920
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:16,757 --> 01:16:18,217
Read it.

872
01:16:20,678 --> 01:16:26,183
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:30,479
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:32,231
Go on.

875
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,278
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:40,030
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:16:41,699 --> 01:16:44,368
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:44,577 --> 01:16:49,290
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:53,043
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:53,294 --> 01:16:55,713
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:56,589 --> 01:17:00,342
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:17:00,509 --> 01:17:04,013
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:04,221 --> 01:17:09,018
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:09,185 --> 01:17:12,688
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:16,692
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:16,901 --> 01:17:21,113
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:21,322 --> 01:17:24,408
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:24,617 --> 01:17:27,953
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:33,959 --> 01:17:36,712
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:41,801 --> 01:17:43,260
Come in.

891
01:17:45,054 --> 01:17:50,226
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:50,434 --> 01:17:54,897
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:58,734
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:58,943 --> 01:18:00,903
...is a map to you?

895
01:18:01,779 --> 01:18:04,240
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:06,242 --> 01:18:09,245
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:09,453 --> 01:18:13,749
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:18,462
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:18,671 --> 01:18:23,134
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:23,342 --> 01:18:25,469
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:25,678 --> 01:18:28,097
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:31,934
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:32,143 --> 01:18:36,856
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:41,569 --> 01:18:45,948
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:51,787
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:54,999
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,709
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:59,336 --> 01:19:01,380
That's not possible.

909
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:04,258
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:07,136 --> 01:19:08,846
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:12,349 --> 01:19:16,479
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:16,687 --> 01:19:22,109
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:22,276 --> 01:19:25,613
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:26,155 --> 01:19:28,199
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:30,576 --> 01:19:32,787
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:35,206 --> 01:19:38,125
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:40,336 --> 01:19:44,381
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,344
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:48,552 --> 01:19:52,431
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,268
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:56,477 --> 01:20:00,439
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:20:00,648 --> 01:20:03,734
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:21,252
Have I said something?

924
01:20:25,965 --> 01:20:30,928
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:33,681
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:33,889 --> 01:20:36,016
Hang on.

927
01:20:36,267 --> 01:20:39,103
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:42,898
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:20,644 --> 01:21:25,900
Harry Potter...

930
01:21:32,823 --> 01:21:37,036
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:21:37,244 --> 01:21:38,871
Sorry?

932
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:43,709
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:43,876 --> 01:21:45,920
...shall break free.

934
01:21:46,086 --> 01:21:48,297
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:48,506 --> 01:21:54,512
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:04,104
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:04,897 --> 01:22:06,690
No.

938
01:22:07,149 --> 01:22:08,692
Nothing.

939
01:23:01,287 --> 01:23:05,332
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:05,499 --> 01:23:08,252
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

941
01:23:08,419 --> 01:23:12,548
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:12,756 --> 01:23:15,217
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:15,426 --> 01:23:17,553
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

944
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:20,848
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:21,056 --> 01:23:22,766
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:23,392 --> 01:23:25,603
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:39,742 --> 01:23:41,786
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:41,994 --> 01:23:46,207
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:50,753
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:14,527
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:14,693 --> 01:24:16,946
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:17,154 --> 01:24:19,532
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,743
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:25,287
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:24:26,288 --> 01:24:28,332
When it happens.

956
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:29,792
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:30,835 --> 01:24:32,378
A great man.

958
01:24:34,839 --> 01:24:37,842
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:38,008 --> 01:24:41,178
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:41,345 --> 01:24:44,974
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,775
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:54,984 --> 01:24:58,654
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:58,863 --> 01:25:02,616
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:25:02,783 --> 01:25:03,826
I meant me!

965
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:06,787
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:13,252 --> 01:25:14,628
Hagrid!

967
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:17,882
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:22,136
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:22,344 --> 01:25:26,390
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:30,352
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:30,561 --> 01:25:34,148
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:35,566 --> 01:25:37,943
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:38,152 --> 01:25:39,862
Hagrid.

974
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:43,949
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:25:45,826 --> 01:25:48,579
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:25:48,788 --> 01:25:51,457
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:54,293
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:54,543 --> 01:25:58,380
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:03,010
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:06,597
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:07,765 --> 01:26:11,352
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:11,519 --> 01:26:14,688
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:14,855 --> 01:26:20,361
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:20,528 --> 01:26:24,031
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:24,281 --> 01:26:28,661
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:26:28,828 --> 01:26:30,538
What?

987
01:26:30,746 --> 01:26:32,790
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:32,998 --> 01:26:35,126
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:40,214 --> 01:26:42,508
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:29,054 --> 01:27:30,514
Oh, no.

991
01:27:41,442 --> 01:27:43,652
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:44,236 --> 01:27:46,197
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:47,156 --> 01:27:50,659
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:52,203 --> 01:27:53,913
Wait!

995
01:27:59,877 --> 01:28:04,173
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,634
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:12,264
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,517
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:21,524 --> 01:28:24,527
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:24,777 --> 01:28:26,737
Harry!

1001
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:30,699
- Help!
- Ron!

1002
01:28:32,868 --> 01:28:36,122
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,930
Come on!

1004
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,267
Move!

1005
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:02,064
Duck!

1006
01:29:37,975 --> 01:29:40,269
Harry!

1007
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,163
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:03,209
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:03,793 --> 01:30:05,252
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,150
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:29,235 --> 01:30:30,861
Come on.

1012
01:30:41,205 --> 01:30:42,581
Ron.

1013
01:30:43,165 --> 01:30:45,751
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:46,001 --> 01:30:49,171
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:31:03,102 --> 01:31:05,855
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:06,063 --> 01:31:07,857
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:08,065 --> 01:31:09,942
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:16,198 --> 01:31:18,325
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:19,577 --> 01:31:21,370
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:25,124 --> 01:31:29,253
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:29,503 --> 01:31:32,506
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:33,132 --> 01:31:36,719
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:48,189
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:31:48,397 --> 01:31:49,648
- It's him.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:49,857 --> 01:31:53,027
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:53,486 --> 01:31:57,239
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:57,948 --> 01:32:00,951
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:32:03,788 --> 01:32:05,498
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:09,168
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:09,418 --> 01:32:12,338
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:12,505 --> 01:32:14,882
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:15,132 --> 01:32:17,718
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:17,927 --> 01:32:20,304
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:23,349
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:32,817 --> 01:32:34,527
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:35,152 --> 01:32:38,864
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:39,073 --> 01:32:40,616
I know why.

1038
01:32:40,866 --> 01:32:43,077
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:43,285 --> 01:32:46,205
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:46,372 --> 01:32:48,249
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:48,457 --> 01:32:51,961
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:52,169 --> 01:32:55,589
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:55,798 --> 01:32:58,884
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:59,426 --> 01:33:02,346
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:33:02,555 --> 01:33:05,558
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:08,519 --> 01:33:10,980
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:11,188 --> 01:33:13,399
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:13,607 --> 01:33:14,900
Severus...

1049
01:33:15,109 --> 01:33:19,822
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:21,323
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:21,532 --> 01:33:25,911
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,789
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:33:28,956 --> 01:33:33,919
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:34,128 --> 01:33:36,672
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:36,922 --> 01:33:38,466
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:33:38,674 --> 01:33:41,051
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,762
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:44,346 --> 01:33:46,807
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:47,308 --> 01:33:52,897
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:55,775
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:59,487
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:33:59,653 --> 01:34:05,075
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:05,284 --> 01:34:07,495
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:10,539
After you.

1065
01:34:15,002 --> 01:34:16,712
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:18,506 --> 01:34:22,092
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:22,301 --> 01:34:24,845
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:25,054 --> 01:34:26,680
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:26,889 --> 01:34:29,892
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:30,059 --> 01:34:33,229
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:36,232
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,402
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:40,903 --> 01:34:45,449
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:45,783 --> 01:34:48,869
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:49,078 --> 01:34:51,539
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:51,747 --> 01:34:54,291
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,419
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:57,670 --> 01:35:00,923
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:04,093
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,807
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:09,974 --> 01:35:11,016
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:11,225 --> 01:35:14,311
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:36,792 --> 01:35:38,586
Remus?

1084
01:35:39,378 --> 01:35:40,838
Sirius.

1085
01:35:41,046 --> 01:35:42,923
My old friends!

1086
01:35:48,596 --> 01:35:52,391
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,228
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:57,104 --> 01:35:59,690
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:05,112
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:05,321 --> 01:36:08,157
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:08,365 --> 01:36:10,951
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:11,368 --> 01:36:16,957
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:19,126 --> 01:36:21,504
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:21,712 --> 01:36:27,384
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:32,014
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:36:32,264 --> 01:36:34,308
No!

1097
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:39,730
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:41,816
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:47,029
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,616
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:50,991 --> 01:36:53,202
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:57,123 --> 01:37:00,876
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:37:01,043 --> 01:37:04,547
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:04,755 --> 01:37:06,298
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:06,465 --> 01:37:10,302
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:10,469 --> 01:37:15,683
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:20,771
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:33,325 --> 01:37:34,785
Okay.

1109
01:37:39,832 --> 01:37:42,334
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:42,543 --> 01:37:43,919
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:44,712 --> 01:37:46,672
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:47,006 --> 01:37:50,092
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:51,719 --> 01:37:54,722
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:37:54,889 --> 01:37:57,433
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:57,933 --> 01:38:00,603
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:04,982
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:06,233 --> 01:38:08,027
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:08,903 --> 01:38:12,615
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:13,365 --> 01:38:16,535
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:18,662 --> 01:38:21,499
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:22,291 --> 01:38:24,418
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:24,627 --> 01:38:27,797
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:38:27,963 --> 01:38:29,507
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:29,673 --> 01:38:33,344
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:33,552 --> 01:38:35,888
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:36,096 --> 01:38:39,183
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:42,728
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:42,895 --> 01:38:45,356
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:45,564 --> 01:38:49,610
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:38:52,071 --> 01:38:53,948
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:54,156 --> 01:38:58,202
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:00,371
I know.

1133
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:05,584
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:08,212
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:10,881
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:12,216 --> 01:39:15,386
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:15,594 --> 01:39:17,138
Harry!

1138
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:36,198
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:37,575 --> 01:39:42,913
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:39:44,248 --> 01:39:46,208
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:47,418 --> 01:39:49,462
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:59,597 --> 01:40:01,140
Harry!

1143
01:40:02,224 --> 01:40:05,144
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,694
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:23,746 --> 01:40:25,790
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:25,956 --> 01:40:31,003
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:31,212 --> 01:40:33,422
Professor?

1148
01:40:37,551 --> 01:40:39,094
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:46,852 --> 01:40:50,106
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:50,523 --> 01:40:53,025
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:26,851 --> 01:41:27,852
Sirius!

1152
01:41:28,727 --> 01:41:31,105
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:36,962 --> 01:42:38,339
Sirius!

1154
01:42:39,173 --> 01:42:42,092
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:24,009 --> 01:43:26,846
Expecto Patronum!

1156
01:45:39,687 --> 01:45:42,064
Harry?

1157
01:45:42,982 --> 01:45:45,317
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:45,568 --> 01:45:47,111
What?

1159
01:45:47,319 --> 01:45:48,863
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:49,029 --> 01:45:50,406
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:50,614 --> 01:45:52,241
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:52,491 --> 01:45:55,327
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:55,494 --> 01:45:57,955
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:58,205 --> 01:45:59,999
Much worse.

1165
01:46:00,207 --> 01:46:02,585
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:04,295 --> 01:46:05,671
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:46:05,838 --> 01:46:09,175
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:09,383 --> 01:46:11,594
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,137
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:13,554 --> 01:46:17,308
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:17,558 --> 01:46:21,187
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:21,437 --> 01:46:23,898
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:24,148 --> 01:46:29,570
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:32,656 --> 01:46:35,409
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:35,618 --> 01:46:39,371
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:44,585 --> 01:46:47,087
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:48,297 --> 01:46:49,590
Powerful...

1178
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:52,635
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:54,261 --> 01:46:57,848
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:58,682 --> 01:47:00,810
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:47:00,976 --> 01:47:02,770
You must not be seen.

1182
01:47:02,937 --> 01:47:06,565
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:06,774 --> 01:47:10,277
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:10,861 --> 01:47:12,655
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:12,822 --> 01:47:15,658
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:17,493 --> 01:47:19,703
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:26,377
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:26,585 --> 01:47:32,424
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:32,591 --> 01:47:34,635
Good luck.

1190
01:47:35,177 --> 01:47:37,596
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:38,305 --> 01:47:40,599
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:48:09,628 --> 01:48:11,255
What just happened?

1193
01:48:11,422 --> 01:48:13,716
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:13,883 --> 01:48:15,759
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:15,926 --> 01:48:17,720
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:20,222
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:21,348 --> 01:48:23,142
Hermione!

1198
01:48:41,368 --> 01:48:44,038
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:45,831 --> 01:48:49,418
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:49,627 --> 01:48:52,463
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:53,923
That's us.

1202
01:48:54,173 --> 01:48:57,092
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:57,301 --> 01:48:58,761
This is not normal.

1204
01:49:01,055 --> 01:49:03,432
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:03,599 --> 01:49:05,810
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:05,976 --> 01:49:09,313
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:09,522 --> 01:49:12,691
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:16,237
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:18,572 --> 01:49:21,742
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:26,163
Good punch.

1211
01:49:26,372 --> 01:49:27,832
Thanks.

1212
01:49:28,874 --> 01:49:30,501
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:33,754
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:34,255 --> 01:49:37,341
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:37,508 --> 01:49:41,387
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:42,805 --> 01:49:45,349
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:04,535 --> 01:50:07,037
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:08,539 --> 01:50:10,416
Of course.

1219
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:12,543
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:12,751 --> 01:50:16,797
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:17,173 --> 01:50:18,466
Let's go.

1222
01:50:39,779 --> 01:50:41,906
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:42,072 --> 01:50:44,533
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:44,742 --> 01:50:47,203
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:48,245 --> 01:50:50,623
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,542
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:53,793 --> 01:50:56,712
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:56,879 --> 01:50:59,882
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:03,761 --> 01:51:06,430
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,475
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:09,642 --> 01:51:12,478
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:51:12,686 --> 01:51:14,897
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:18,234 --> 01:51:19,944
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:22,905
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:25,116 --> 01:51:26,659
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:37,628 --> 01:51:39,171
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:45,177 --> 01:51:46,554
That hurt.

1238
01:51:46,762 --> 01:51:48,055
Sorry.

1239
01:52:08,951 --> 01:52:11,620
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:29,013 --> 01:52:31,849
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:33,893 --> 01:52:35,186
What?

1242
01:52:36,103 --> 01:52:37,897
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:38,147 --> 01:52:40,816
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:55,122 --> 01:52:57,416
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:03,672 --> 01:53:05,633
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:27,822 --> 01:53:31,242
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:32,076 --> 01:53:35,246
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:53:35,454 --> 01:53:39,208
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:43,712 --> 01:53:46,382
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:52,555
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:53,431 --> 01:53:56,684
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:53:57,101 --> 01:53:58,811
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:54:01,522 --> 01:54:04,442
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:04,692 --> 01:54:06,986
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:09,613 --> 01:54:14,076
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:14,326 --> 01:54:15,953
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:54:16,203 --> 01:54:19,540
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:19,748 --> 01:54:23,252
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:23,419 --> 01:54:26,255
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:27,214 --> 01:54:30,050
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:30,259 --> 01:54:31,427
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:31,594 --> 01:54:33,304
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:33,554 --> 01:54:36,223
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1264
01:54:37,892 --> 01:54:39,602
But where is it?

1265
01:54:40,519 --> 01:54:42,730
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:43,355 --> 01:54:45,566
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:45,733 --> 01:54:47,026
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:47,276 --> 01:54:51,322
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:52,823
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:53,073 --> 01:54:57,286
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:54:57,536 --> 01:55:00,372
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:55:00,539 --> 01:55:02,416
- Right.
- Well, well.

1273
01:55:02,583 --> 01:55:04,126
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:04,293 --> 01:55:07,296
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:07,505 --> 01:55:12,927
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:13,094 --> 01:55:17,056
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:17,264 --> 01:55:19,141
Thank you.

1278
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:22,603
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:33,405 --> 01:55:34,865
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:41,705 --> 01:55:43,499
This way, now.

1281
01:55:45,918 --> 01:55:47,628
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:47,878 --> 01:55:50,339
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:55:59,682 --> 01:56:02,017
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!

1284
01:56:08,482 --> 01:56:10,443
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:16,699 --> 01:56:18,325
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:19,577 --> 01:56:21,370
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:48,939 --> 01:56:52,193
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:56:54,987 --> 01:56:56,781
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:56:56,947 --> 01:57:01,243
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:57:01,452 --> 01:57:03,579
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:03,746 --> 01:57:07,166
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:08,626
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:08,834 --> 01:57:10,711
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,379
According to him...

1295
01:57:12,546 --> 01:57:15,966
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:16,133 --> 01:57:18,010
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:19,136 --> 01:57:20,930
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:21,097 --> 01:57:23,307
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:24,767 --> 01:57:27,061
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:31,232 --> 01:57:32,858
Here we come.

1301
01:57:38,531 --> 01:57:40,866
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:41,075 --> 01:57:43,911
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:57:44,078 --> 01:57:47,414
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:47,581 --> 01:57:49,208
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:49,875 --> 01:57:51,836
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:52,002 --> 01:57:54,588
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:54,797 --> 01:57:57,633
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:58,676 --> 01:58:00,219
Harry!

1309
01:58:01,762 --> 01:58:03,472
Run!

1310
01:58:10,354 --> 01:58:11,897
Let's go.

1311
01:58:31,459 --> 01:58:33,752
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:58:38,048 --> 01:58:39,425
Thanks.

1313
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:45,306
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
02:00:00,422 --> 02:00:02,133
That was so scary.

1315
02:00:02,341 --> 02:00:05,261
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:16,730 --> 02:00:19,817
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:35,875 --> 02:00:38,002
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:38,169 --> 02:00:41,338
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:50,097 --> 02:00:51,891
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:52,141 --> 02:00:54,185
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:55,561 --> 02:00:58,022
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:00,733
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:04,904 --> 02:01:07,323
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
02:01:09,408 --> 02:01:11,285
...both of you.

1325
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:15,080
Harry!

1326
02:01:16,999 --> 02:01:20,836
Expecto Patronum!

1327
02:02:19,478 --> 02:02:21,021
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,567
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:24,733 --> 02:02:27,486
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:27,653 --> 02:02:29,989
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:30,197 --> 02:02:31,907
...well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:32,074 --> 02:02:34,493
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:34,702 --> 02:02:37,538
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:50,676 --> 02:02:51,969
Bombarda!

1335
02:03:25,336 --> 02:03:28,088
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:28,297 --> 02:03:29,590
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:29,799 --> 02:03:32,718
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:32,885 --> 02:03:35,805
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:35,971 --> 02:03:37,681
And besides...

1340
02:03:38,641 --> 02:03:41,894
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:42,103 --> 02:03:44,230
And you know it.

1342
02:03:45,314 --> 02:03:47,191
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:49,527 --> 02:03:52,029
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:53,072 --> 02:03:55,574
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:57,368 --> 02:03:59,328
Except your eyes.

1346
02:04:00,287 --> 02:04:02,581
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:04,542 --> 02:04:09,588
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:10,214 --> 02:04:11,674
But know this:

1349
02:04:12,842 --> 02:04:16,011
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:17,388 --> 02:04:19,348
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:21,725 --> 02:04:23,602
...in here.

1352
02:04:33,988 --> 02:04:36,490
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:05:03,350 --> 02:05:04,977
We have to go.

1354
02:05:33,255 --> 02:05:35,925
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:36,092 --> 02:05:37,635
Did what?

1356
02:05:37,802 --> 02:05:39,762
Good night.

1357
02:05:48,521 --> 02:05:49,814
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:50,022 --> 02:05:52,691
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:53,025 --> 02:05:55,611
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:59,323
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:27,309
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:32,773
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:37,361 --> 02:06:40,030
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:42,783 --> 02:06:45,953
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:49,039
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:49,248 --> 02:06:51,041
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:51,208 --> 02:06:56,464
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:56,672 --> 02:07:02,178
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:07:02,344 --> 02:07:05,681
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:05,931 --> 02:07:07,808
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1371
02:07:08,017 --> 02:07:09,894
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:13,314
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:07:13,939 --> 02:07:17,276
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:26,827 --> 02:07:29,371
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,707
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:31,916 --> 02:07:35,419
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:35,628 --> 02:07:39,131
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:39,298 --> 02:07:41,759
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:42,176 --> 02:07:44,637
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:49,308 --> 02:07:51,519
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:51,685 --> 02:07:54,355
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:54,522 --> 02:07:57,274
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:57,441 --> 02:08:01,654
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:08:02,613 --> 02:08:05,074
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:05,282 --> 02:08:07,827
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:08,410 --> 02:08:09,703
Until then...

1387
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,790
...mischief managed.

1388
02:08:47,032 --> 02:08:51,245
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:51,412 --> 02:08:52,788
Harry.

1390
02:08:53,664 --> 02:08:55,040
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:55,207 --> 02:08:57,585
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:57,793 --> 02:08:59,920
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1393
02:09:00,129 --> 02:09:03,382
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:03,591 --> 02:09:06,051
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:07,720
Did not.

1396
02:09:09,138 --> 02:09:12,641
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:12,808 --> 02:09:14,351
For me?

1398
02:09:14,518 --> 02:09:17,021
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:09:17,229 --> 02:09:19,106
This came with it.

1400
02:09:23,986 --> 02:09:25,613
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:25,821 --> 02:09:27,615
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:47,009 --> 02:09:48,636
Lumos.

1403
02:09:48,803 --> 02:09:51,180
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1404
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:12,194
Mischief managed.

1405
02:21:17,950 --> 02:21:19,410
Nox.
