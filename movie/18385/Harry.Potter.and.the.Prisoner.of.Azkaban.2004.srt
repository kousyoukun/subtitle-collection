弗农姨夫  帮我在表格上签个字
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.

24
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,190
什么东西
What is it?

25
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,450
没什么  学校要求的
Nothing. School stuff.

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,220
等一下再说  看你规不规矩
Later perhaps, if you behave.

27
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,590
她规矩了我就规矩
I will if she does.

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,820
小子  你还住这呢
Oh, you're still here, are you?

29
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,930
没错
Yes.

30
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,930
你怎么这么不知感恩
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.

31
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,110
亏得我弟弟好心收养你
Damn good of my brother to keep you.

32
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,820
换了我
He'd have been straight to

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,610
肯定把你扔到孤儿院去
an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

34
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,180
这是我的小达达吗  我的宝贝侄侄
Is that my Dudders? Is that my little neffy-pooh?

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,110
来亲一个  来  快上来
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

把玛姬的行李搬到楼上去

37
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,760

Okay.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,030
帮妈妈舔干净  好孩子  乖乖
Finish that off for Mommy. Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

39
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,760
来点酒吗  玛姬
Can I tempt you, Marge?

40
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,000
一点就够了
Just a small one.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,100
味道好极了  佩妮
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,670
再加点
A bit more.

43
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,610
我平时只吃一个煎鸡蛋  还和狗狗一起分享
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,340
一点点就够了  好孩子
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,450
要不要来点白兰地
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?

46
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,640
小宝贝要不要白兰地地
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,920
笑什么笑
What are you smirking at?

48
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,960
你送他去哪念书  弗农
Where did you send the boy, Vernon?

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,430
圣布鲁斯  无可救药的孩子都去那
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.

50
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,600
在圣布鲁斯被棍子抽过吗  小子
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?

51
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,270
抽过
Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,270
抽过无数次了
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,000
打得好  讲道理不如抽棍子
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,340
不听话的孩子就得好好教训
wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,610
不要自责  弗农  跟你没关系
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.

56
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,790
这是遗传的问题  上梁不正下梁歪
It's all to do with blood. Bad blood will out.

57
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,080
这孩子的父亲干什么的  佩妮
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?

58
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,260
无业游民  没工作
Nothing. He didn't work. He was unemployed.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,290
-肯定是个酒鬼  -胡说
- And a drunk too, no doubt? - That's a lie.

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,990
-你说什么  -我爸不是酒鬼
- What did you say? - My dad wasn't a drunk.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,060
别担心  佩妮  我太用力了
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. I have a very firm grip.

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,110
你该去睡觉了
I think it's time you went to bed.

63
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,470
等等  弗农  你  来弄干净
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,650
其实吧  也不是因为父亲
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,740
关键是母亲
It's all to do with the mother.

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,790
从狗身上就能看出来
You see it all the time with dogs.

67
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
假如母狗有问题
If something's wrong with the bitch,

68
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,010
小狗崽肯定也好不到哪里去
then something's wrong with the pup.

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,890
闭嘴  闭嘴
Shut up! Shut up!

70
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,630
好的
Right.

71
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,930
听我说
Let me tell you...

72
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,550

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
弗农  弗农  快帮忙
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

74
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,810
停下
Stop!

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,950
我抓住你了  玛姬  我抓住你了
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

76
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,390
-抓牢  抓牢  -别咬我
- Hold on, hold on. - Get off.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,490
-敢说我的狗  -抱歉
- Don't you dare! - Sorry.

78
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,520
弗农
Oh, Vernon.

79
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,390
我的天哪
Oh, God.

80
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,390
玛姬
Marge!

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,600
别这样
Please!

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,400
玛姬
Marge!

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,670
回来
Come back!

84
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,140
把她弄回来  给我弄回来
You bring her back! You bring her back now.

85
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,570
-让她恢复原状  -她活该
- You put her right! - No. She deserved what she got.

86
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,100
-离我远点  -你不能在校外使用魔法
- Keep away from me. - You can't do magic outside school.

87
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,350
-是吗  想不想试试  -他们不会让你回去的
- Yeah? Try me. - They won't let you back now.

88
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,880
你没地方可去了
You've nowhere to go.

89
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,380
无所谓  哪都比这好
I don't care. Anywhere is better than here.

90
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,310
"欢迎乘坐骑士公车
"Welcome to the Knight Bus

91
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,890
本公车专门接待流落街头的巫师
emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.

92
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,790
我叫斯坦・桑帕克
My name is Stan Shunpike,

93
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,990
今晚是你的售票员
and I will be your conductor for this evening."

94
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
你坐在地上干嘛
What you doing down there?

95
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,060
-我摔倒了  -为什么摔倒
- I fell over. - What you fell over for?

96
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,900
-我又不是故意的  -那赶紧上车啊
- I didn't do it on purpose. - Well, come on, then.

97
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,300
等的花儿都谢了
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

98
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,980
你在看什么
What you looking at?

99
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,450
没什么
Nothing.

100
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,350
别磨叽了  上车吧
Well, come on, then. In.

101
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,350
不  不  我来拿行李  你上车

-开车吧  厄恩  -开车吧  厄尼
- Take her away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

104
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,620
这趟旅途很颠簸哟
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

105
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,480
你说你叫什么来着
What did you say your name was?

106
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
我没说
I didn't.

107
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,970
你想去哪
Whereabouts are you headed?

108
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,270
破釜酒吧  在伦敦
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

109
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,520
听见没  破釜酒吧  在伦敦
You hear that? Ern, "The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London."

110
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,980
破釜酒吧  要是点了豆子汤
The Leaky Cauldron. If you have pea soup

111
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,950
先吃它  别被它吃了
make sure you eat it before it eats you.

112
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,990
-麻瓜会看到我们吗  -麻瓜
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us? - Muggles?

113
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,890
他们什么都看不见
They don't see nothing, do they?

114
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,620
拿叉子戳他们还是有感觉的
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

115
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,430
厄尼  正前方有个老妇人
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

116
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,680

120
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,250
走着
Yes!

121
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,220
阿兹卡班越狱犯

122
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,030
那是谁
Who is that?

123
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,600
那个人
That man.

124
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,970
那是谁
Who is that?

125
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,670
那是
Who is...?

126
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,310
这是小天狼星布莱克
That is Sirius Black, that is.

127
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,110
别说你从来没听说过小天狼星布莱克
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.

128
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,710
他是个杀人犯
He's a murderer.

129
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,510
所以被关在阿兹卡班监狱
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.

130
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,620
-他怎么逃出来的  -关键就在这呢
- How did he escape? - Well, that's the question, isn't it?

131
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,760
他是第一个成功越狱的
He's the first one that done it.

132
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,320
他效忠于
He was a big supporter of

133
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,330
神秘人
You-Know-Who.

134
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,900
总该听说过他吧
I reckon you've heard of him.

135
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,160
是听说过
Him I've heard of.

136
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,530
厄尼  前面两辆双层巴士
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.

137
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,700
越来越近了  厄尼
They're getting closer, Ernie.

138
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,740
厄尼  要撞上我们了
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

139
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,620
当心脑袋
Mind your head.

140
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,390
伙计们  没事吧
Hey, guys? Guys?

141
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,720
拉长脸干什么
Why the long faces?

142
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,040
差不多快到了  快了
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

143
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,850
-破釜酒吧  -下一站  翻倒巷
- The Leaky Cauldron. - Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

144
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,850
波特先生  您来了
Mr. Potter, at last.

145
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,590
-开车  厄恩  -开车  厄尼
- Take it away, Ern. - Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

146
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,650
11号房间
Room 11.

147
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,550
海德薇
Hedwig.

148
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,490
多么聪明的鸟儿  波特先生
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.

149
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,350
五分钟前他就自己找到这了
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.

150
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,190
身为魔法部长
As Minister for Magic,

151
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,890
我有义务告知你  波特先生
it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter

152
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,260
今天傍晚时分  有人发现你姨夫的姐姐
that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located

153
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,410
绕着谢菲尔德南边的一个烟囱转圈
a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.

154
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,310
魔法事故和灾害司已经妥善处理
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.

155
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,350
将她复原并修改了记忆
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.

156
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,210
这件事对她来说就像没发生一样
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.

157
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,980
就这么解决了
So that's that...

158
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,060
平安无事
and no harm done.

159
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,020
来点豆子汤
Pea soup?

160
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,320
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you.

161
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,690
-部长  -什么事
- Minister? - Yes?

162
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,630
-我不明白  -不明白什么
- I don't understand. - Understand?

163
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,860
我触犯了法规
I broke the law.

164
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,330
未成年巫师不能在家使用魔法
Underage wizards can't use magic at home.

165
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,580
别紧张  怎么能因为把姨妈吹起来
Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban

166
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,280
就把你送到阿兹卡班呢
for blowing up their aunts.

167
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,960
但另一方面  擅自离家出走
On the other hand, running away like that,

168
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,740
在当前形势下
given the state of things

169
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,420
可是很不负责任的
was very, very irresponsible.

170
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,710
当前形势是什么意思
"The state of things," Sir?

171
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,360
有个在逃杀人犯
We have a killer on the loose.

172
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
是小天狼星布莱克吗
Sirius Black, you mean?

173
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,290
跟我又有什么关系呢
But what's he got to do with me?

174
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,560
当然没关系  你很安全
Nothing, of course. You're safe.

175
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,400
这才最关键
And that's what matters.

176
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,730
明天你就得回到霍格沃茨去
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.

177
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,910
这些是你的新课本
These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty

178
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,980
我叫人取来了
of having them brought here.

179
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,050
让汤姆带你去休息吧
Now Tom will show you to your room.

180
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,280
海德薇
Hedwig.

181
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,330
哈利  顺便说一声  在这的时候
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here,

182
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,460
好好待着  最好不要出去
it would be best if you didn't

183
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,260
闲逛
wander.

184
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,730
拜托  把车子挪挪
Right! You gonna move that bus or what?

185
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,450
妖怪们的妖怪书

186
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,450
打扫客房
Housekeeping.

187
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,150
我待会儿再来
I'll come back later.

188
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,160
我警告你  赫敏
I'm warning you, Hermione.

189
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,290
别让那个畜生靠近斑斑
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,

190
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,030
否则我就把她变成茶壶套
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

191
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,390
她是只猫  罗恩
It's a cat, Ronald.

192
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,290
你还能让她怎么样
What do you expect?

193
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,470
-猫就是抓老鼠的  -那是猫吗
- It's in his nature. - A cat? Is that what they told you?

194
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,190
看着像长毛猪
Looks like a pig with hair.

195
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,880
自己耗子像臭鞋刷  还好意思说别人
That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.

196
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,580
不要怕  克鲁克山  别理这个小坏蛋
It's all right, Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.

197
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,280
哈利
Harry.

198
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,820
哈利
Harry.

199
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,810
埃及之旅怎么样
Egypt. What's it like?

200
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,810
大奖得主游埃及

201
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,050
棒极了  到处都是老古董
Brilliant. Loads of old stuff.

202
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,490
木乃伊  古墓
Like mummies, tombs,

203
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,590
连斑斑都玩得很开心
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

204
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,920
-埃及人过去崇拜猫  -是啊  还崇拜屎壳郎呢
- Egyptians used to worship cats. - Yeah. Along with the dung beetle.

205
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,260
-你又显摆剪报了  -我哪显摆过
- Not flashing that clipping again, are you, Ron? - I haven't shown anyone.

206
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,830
是没显摆过  除非不算汤姆
No, not a soul. Not unless you count Tom.

207
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,470

- And that wizard from Belgium.  - Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,630
-亲爱的  见到你真好  -我也是
- Good to see you, dear. - Good to see you too.

211
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,140
-东西都拿齐了吗  -是的

215
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,680
-哈利・波特  -韦斯莱先生
- Harry Potter. - Mr. Weasley.

216
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,410
哈利  跟你说几句
Harry, wonder if I might have a word?

217
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,390
没问题
Yeah, sure.

218
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,220
-赫敏  -早上好  韦斯莱先生
- Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

219
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,080
期待新学期吗
Looking forward to a new term?

220
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,020
当然  肯定很棒
Yeah. It should be great.

221
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,930
哈利  魔法部里有人强烈反对
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me

222
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,930
通缉令

223
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,760
我给你透露这些消息
from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.

224
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,270
但我觉得你有必要知道真相
But I think that you need to know the facts.

225
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,040
你现在很危险
You are in danger.

226
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,250
生命危险
Grave danger.

227
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,310
是不是跟小天狼星布莱克有关
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?

228
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,590
你对小天狼星布莱克了解多少
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?

229
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,890
只知道他从阿兹卡班越狱了
Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.

230
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,350
知道为什么吗
Do you know why?

231
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,860
十三年前  当你阻止了...
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped....

232
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,860
-伏地魔  -不要说出他的名字
- Voldemort. - Don't say his name.

233
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,360
对不起
Sorry.

234
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,430
当你阻止了神秘人
When you stopped You-Know-Who.

235
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,230
也让布莱克失去了一切
Black lost everything.

236
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,700
但是直到今天  他还是忠心耿耿
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.

237
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,040
他认为
And in his mind,

238
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,250
阻止他的主人归来的
you are the only thing that stands in the way

239
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,140
就是你了
of You-Know-Who returning to power.

240
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,480
他逃离阿兹卡班
And that is why

241
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,210
就是为了这个
he has escaped from Azkaban.

242
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,250
找到你
To find you.

243
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,350
然后杀了我
And kill me.

244
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,960
哈利  你要发誓  无论听到什么
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear,

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,670
都不要去找布莱克
you won't go looking for Black.

246
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,400
韦斯莱先生
Mr. Weasley,

247
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,570
我干嘛去找要杀我的人呢
why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

248
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,470
快点  快点
Quick. Quick.

249
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,110
罗恩  罗恩
Ron, Ron!

250
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,900
天哪
Oh, for goodness' sake!

251
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,550
别弄丢了
Don't lose him!

252
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,620
我不是故意把她吹起来的
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

253
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,320
-就是控制不住了  -干得漂亮
- I lost control. - Brilliant.

254
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,150
罗恩  这可不是开玩笑
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.

255
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,050
哈利没被开除算幸运了
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

256
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,950
没被拘留才是幸运
I was lucky not to be arrested.

257
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,160
我还是觉得干得漂亮
I still think it was brilliant.

258
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,100
进去吧  别的隔间都满了
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,300
那是谁
Who do you think that is?

260
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,190
R・J・ 卢平教授
Professor R.J. Lupin.

261
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,340
你什么都知道吗
Do you know everything?

262
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,630
她怎么什么都知道
How is it she knows everything?

263
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,940
行李上写着呢  罗恩
It's on his suitcase, Ronald.

264
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,410
他睡着了吗
Do you think he's really asleep?

265
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,540
好像是  怎么了
Seems to be. Why?

266
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,410
跟你们说点事
I gotta tell you something.

267
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,100
就是说  小天狼星布莱克从阿兹卡班越狱
Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban

268
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,240
-是冲你来的  -没错
- to come after you? - Yeah.

269
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,270
但是他们会抓住布莱克的  对不
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

270
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,520
大家可都在找他
I mean, everyone's looking for him.

271
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,240
当然了
Sure.

272
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,740
不过从来没人能从阿兹卡班越狱
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before

273
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,780
-他又是个凶残的疯子  -谢了  罗恩
- and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. - Thanks, Ron.

274
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,840
火车怎么停了
Why are we stopping?

275
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,650
还没到站呢
We can't be there yet.

276
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,120
怎么了
What's going on?

277
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,990
不知道  出故障了吧
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.

278
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,270
罗恩  你踩到我了
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

279
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,110
有东西在外面
There's something moving out there.

280
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,720
好像有人上车了
I think someone's coming aboard.

281
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,750
我的天哪  怎么回事
Bloody hell! What's happening?

282
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,290
哈利
Harry.

283
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,220
哈利  你没事吧
Harry, are you all right?

284
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,060
谢谢
Thank you.

285
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,670
来  吃了吧  对你有好处
Here, eat this. It'll help.

286
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,300
没关系的  只是块巧克力
It's all right. It's chocolate.

287
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,680
刚才那是什么东西
What was that thing that came?

288
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,020
那是摄魂怪  阿兹卡班的守卫
It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban.

289
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,350
现在已经走了
It's gone now.

290
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,120
他们要找小天狼星布莱克
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.

291
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,540
抱歉
If you'll excuse me,

292
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,920
我要去和司机说几句话
I need to have a little word with the driver.

293
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,470
吃吧  吃了能好受点
Eat. You'll feel better.

294
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,570
我刚才怎么了
What happened to me?

295
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,470
你全身僵硬
Well, you sort of went rigid.

296
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,810
我们还以为你痉挛了呢
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.

297
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,380
那你们两个呢
And did either of you two...

298
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,880
你们
you know...

299
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,150
-也昏过去了吗  -没有
- pass out? - No.

300
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,020
不过感觉特别怪
I felt weird, though.

301
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,020
好像再也高兴不起来了
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

302
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,490
我听到有人在尖叫
But someone was screaming.

303
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,030
一个女人
A woman.

304
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,000
没有人尖叫  哈利
No one was screaming, Harry.

305
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,570
左 霍格沃茨  右 霍格莫德

306
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,090
新的学年  欢迎回到霍格沃茨
Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.

307
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,000
在大家撑的头昏脑涨之前
I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled

308
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,800
我还有几句话要说
by our excellent feast.

309
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,270
首先  很高兴告诉大家
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin...

310
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,810
莱姆斯・约翰・卢平教授已经同意
who's kindly consented to fill the post...

311
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,510
担任黑魔法防御术课的老师
of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

312
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,180
祝你好运  教授
Good luck, professor.

313
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,150
怪不得他要你吃巧克力  哈利
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

314
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,980
波特  你昏倒的事是真的吗
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

315
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,830
-你真的昏倒了吗  -滚开  马尔福
- I mean, you actually fainted? - Shove off, Malfoy.

316
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,000
-他怎么会知道  -管他呢
- How did he find out? - Just forget it.

317
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,530
我们保护神奇生物课的老师
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher...

318
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,600
决定退休了
has decided to retire...

319
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,530
因为肢体稍有缺损
in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.

320
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,440
幸运的是  我很高兴宣布
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce...

321
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,440
接替他的正是我们的
that his place will be taken by none other...

322
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,980
鲁伯・海格
than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

323
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,060
最后  应魔法部的要求
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

324
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,770
还有一条令人不安的消息
at the request of the Ministry of Magic...

325
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,500
霍格沃茨将会接待一批特殊的客人
Hogwarts will, until further notice,

326
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,070
来自阿兹卡班的摄魂怪
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

327
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,210
直到小天狼星落网
until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.

328
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,840
摄魂怪将守住每一处入口
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.

329
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,670
虽然部里保证
Now whilst I've been assured...

330
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,110
他们的存在
that their presence

331
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,550
不会影响到我们的日常活动
will not disrupt our day-to-day activities...

332
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,050
但还是要提醒
A word of caution.

333
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,420
摄魂怪是最邪恶的生物  它们无法区别
Dementors are vicious creatures. They'll not distinguish...

334
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,990
猎物和挡路的人
between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.

335
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,790
因此  我警告每一个人
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...

336
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,600
不要给它们伤害你们的机会
to give them no reason to harm you.

337
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,440
摄魂怪生来就不懂得宽恕
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.

338
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,910
但是  快乐是无处不在的
But you know, happiness can be found...

339
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,670
无论多么黑暗
even in the darkest of times...

340
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,820
只要我们点亮心灯
if one only remembers to turn on the light.

341
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,770
吉星高照胖夫人
Fortuna Major.

342
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,270
看吧  她就是不让进
Here, listen. She just won't let me in.

343
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,450
-吉星高照胖夫人  -不  等等
- Fortuna Major. - No, no. Wait, wait.

344
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,410
看这个
Watch this.

345
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,160
-看我歌声的力量  -吉星高照胖夫人
- Amazing. Just with my voice. - Fortuna Major.

346
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,920
-好了  进去吧  -谢谢
- Yes, all right. Go in. - Thank you.

347
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,900
三年了  她还是老样子
Still doing that after three years.

348
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,230
-她根本不会唱歌  -没错
- She can't even sing. - Exactly.

349
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,640
-晚上好  -晚上好
- Hey, man. - Hey, man.

350
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,040
-天哪  -真可怕
- Oh, God. - That's awful.

351
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,170
绿色的是猴子
Green. That's a monkey.

352
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,680
-这是什么啊  -你管这叫猴子吗
- What is that? - You call that a monkey?

353
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,980
别给他吃了
Do not give him one again.

354
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,780
来  纳威  试试大象
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

355
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,630
-罗恩  接着  -好的
- Ron, catch. - I will.

356
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,930
这才叫厉害
I think we have a winner.

357
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,210
-不  别吃那个  -不
- Oh, don't try one of them. - Oh, no.

358
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,350
快看啊  看他的脸
Look at him. His face.

359
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,220
欢迎  孩子们
Welcome, my children.

360
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,520
在这里  你们将在占卜学的世界里遨游
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.

361
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,720
在这里  你会发现自己是否具备"视域"
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.

362
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,380
你们好  我是特里劳妮教授
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

363
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,140
让我们一起走进未来
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.

364
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,590
本学期主要学习茶叶占卜术
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,

365
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,250
也就是解读茶叶的奥妙
the art of reading tea leaves.

366
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,980
请拿起你们对面同学的茶杯
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.

367
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,860
你们看到了什么
What do you see?

368
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,150
真相就像书页中
The truth lies buried like a

369
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,690
隐藏的句句箴言  等待人们去发现
sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.

370
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,330
但首先  你需要开阔思维
But first, you must broaden your minds.

371
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,030
-首先  要放眼未来  -真是废话连篇
- First, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish.

372
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,140
-你从哪儿过来的  -我吗
- Where did you come from? - Me?

373
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,970
-我一直在这儿啊  -孩子
- I've been here all this time. - You, boy....

374
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,440
你的祖母还好吗
Is your grandmother quite well?

375
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,580
她很好
I think so.

376
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,550
我可不这么认为  把杯子给我
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Give me the cup.

377
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,920
真遗憾
Pity.

378
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,750
开阔思维
Broaden your minds.

379
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,690
你的力场在波动  亲爱的  你身在未来了吗
Your aura is pulsing, dear. Are you in the beyond?

380
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,760
-我看是的  -没错
- I think you are. - Sure.

381
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,200
快看杯子  你看到了什么
Look at the cup. Tell me what you see.

382
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,060
好的
Yeah.

383
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,340
哈利这有个歪的十字架  是审判和受难
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering.

384
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,410
还有个太阳  代表幸福和快乐
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.

385
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,940
所以
So...

386
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,190
你会遭点小罪  但却觉得快乐
you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.

387
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,750
把杯子给我
Give me the cup.

388
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,220
亲爱的
Oh, my dear boy.

389
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,960
亲爱的
My dear...

390
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,730
这是不祥
you have the Grim.

391
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,230
不想  什么是不想
The Grin? What's the Grin?

392
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,270
什么不想  蠢货  是不祥
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

393
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,630
"那是条巨大的幽灵犬
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

394
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,280
这是魔法世界最黑暗的预兆
It's among the darkest omens in our world.

395
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,500
预示着
It's an omen...

396
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,540
死亡"
of death."

397
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,540
你们觉得那个不祥
You don't think that Grim

398
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,920
和小天狼星布莱克有关吗
thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?

399
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,060
说实话  罗恩  要我说
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,

400
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,990
占卜学实在是蠢到家了
Divination's a woolly discipline.

401
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,820
古代如尼文  这种课才有意思
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.

402
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,130
古代如尼文  你究竟选了多少课啊
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?

403
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,960
好几门吧
A fair few.

404
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,230
等等  怎么可能
Hang on. That's not possible.

405
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,170
如尼文和占卜课同时上
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.

406
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,340
你得同时上两门课
You have to be in two classes at once.

407
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,950
别傻了  谁能同时上两门课
Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?

408
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,350
"开阔思维  用天目去窥视未来"
"Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future."

409
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,660
好了  来  都靠近点儿
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.

410
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,490
请不要讲话
Less talking, if you don't mind.

411
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,490
今天让你们大开眼界
I got a real treat for you today.

412
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,590
这堂课很精彩  跟我来
A great lesson. So follow me.

413
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,930
好了  不要再讲话了  在那儿站好
Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there.

414
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,610
课本翻到第49页
And open your books to page 49.

415
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,400
这书怎么翻页
Exactly how do we do that?

416
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,520
当然要先抚摸书脊  天呐
Just stroke the spine, of course. Goodness me.

417
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:39,690
-别丢人现眼了  隆巴顿  -我没事
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. - I'm okay. Okay.

418
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,570
-他们真有意思  -真是有趣极了
- I think they're funny. - Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

419
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,270
太逗了  这地方马上就要完蛋了
Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.

420
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,770
要是让我老爸知道
Wait until Father hears

421
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,140
邓布利多让个傻瓜来教我们
Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.

422
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,410
闭嘴  马尔福
Shut up, Malfoy.

423
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,950
摄魂怪  摄魂怪
Dementor! Dementor!

424
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,030
-别理他  -是你捋书  不是书捋你
- Just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it.

425
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,920
他漂亮吧
Isn't he beautiful?

426
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,720
来跟巴克比克打个招呼
Say hello to Buckbeak.

427
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,550
海格  那是什么
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

428
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,790
这是鹰头马身有翼兽  罗恩
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

429
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,460
首先要知道  他们都很骄傲
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.

430
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,570
特别容易被冒犯  千万不要对他无礼
Very easily offended. You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

431
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,470
不然你就死定了
It may be the last thing you ever do.

432
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,040
好了  谁想来打个招呼
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?

433
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,580
很好  哈利
Well done, Harry. Well done.

434
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,820
来啊
Come on now.

435
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,680
好了
Now...

436
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,310
你得先让它行动
you have to let him make the first move.

437
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,590
出于礼貌
It's only polite. So...

438
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,620
你要过来  给它好好鞠个躬
step up. Give him a nice bow.

439
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,260
等等看他是不是回礼
Then you wait and see if he bows back.

440
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,560
如果回礼了  你就可以摸他
If he does, you can go and touch him.

441
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,930
如果没有  那个过会再说
If not-- Well, we'll get to that later.

442
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,630
鞠躬吧
Just make your bow.

443
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,900
认真点  弯腰
Nice and low.

444
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,910
后退  哈利  后退
Back off, Harry. Back off.

445
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,290
别动
Keep still.

446
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,990
别动
Keep still.

447
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,600
很好  哈利  给你  大坏蛋
Well done, Harry. Well done. Here, you big brute, you.

448
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,570
好了  你可以去拍拍他了
Right. I think you can go and pat him now.

449
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,610
去吧  别害羞
Go on. Don't be shy.

450
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,520
要有礼貌  慢一点
Nice and slow, now. Nice and slow. Slow.

451
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,290
不要着急  哈利
Not so fast, Harry.

452
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,630
慢点  哈利  就是这样
Slow down, Harry. That's it....

453
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,000
很好  慢点  等他主动靠近你
Nice and slow. Now let him come to you.

454
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,210
慢点儿  慢点儿
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly....

455
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,210
好的
That's it....

456
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,170
好极了
Yes!

457
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,210
太棒了  哈利  做得漂亮
Well done! Well done, Harry, well done!

458
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,350
他能飞吗
Does he get to fly?

459
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,990
-你可以骑他了  -什么
- I think he may let you ride him now. - What?

460
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,710
去吧
Come on.

461
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,050
我把你放上去  骑在翅膀根部
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.

462
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,900
不要拔羽毛
Don't pull out any of his feathers,

463
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,100
他会不开心的
because he won't thank you for that.

464
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,530
好样的  哈利  好样的  巴克比克
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.

465
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,640
真厉害  哈利
That was wicked, Harry!

466
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,240
有没有搞错
Oh, please.

467
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,340
很好  做得不错
Well done, well done.

468
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,240
-我第一天表现如何  -棒极了  教授
- How am I doing me first day? - Brilliant, professor.

469
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,810
你一点也不危险  丑陋的大怪物
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!

470
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,420
马尔福  不要
Malfoy, no....

471
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,790
不
No!

472
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,120
巴克比克
Buckbeak!

473
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,430
巴克比克
Whoa! Buckbeak!

474
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,900
回去  你这个笨蛋
Away, you silly creature....

475
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,720
它差点要了我的命
It's killed me!

476
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
别激动  只是擦伤
Calm down. It's just a scratch!

477
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,600
海格
Hagrid!

478
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,670
得送他去医院
He has to be taken to the hospital.

479
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,970
我是老师  我送他去
I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

480
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,950
-你们会后悔的  -下课
- You're gonna regret this. - Class dismissed!

481
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,380
你和那只野鸡
You and your bloody chicken!

482
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,910
很疼吗  德拉科
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

483
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,950
有时候还疼  不过我算走运了
It comes and it goes. Still, I consider myself lucky.

484
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,450
庞弗雷夫人说  再晚一分钟我的胳膊就废了
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.

485
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,660
-我好几周不能做作业了  -听那个蠢货
- I can't do homework for weeks. - Listen to the idiot.

486
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,710
真会吹牛皮
He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?

487
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,160
至少海格没被解雇
At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

488
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,220
听说德拉科他爸很生气
I hear Draco's father's furious.

489
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,090
这事肯定没完
We haven't heard the end of this.

490
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,130
-有人看见他了  -谁
- He's been sighted! - Who?

491
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,030
小天狼星布莱克
Sirius Black!

492
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,110
达芙镇  离这里不远
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

493
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,140
他不会来霍格沃茨的  对吧
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?

494
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,810
-这里到处是摄魂怪  -摄魂怪
- With dementors at every entrance? - Dementors?

495
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,760
他已经溜走一次了
He slipped past them once.

496
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,350
谁知道他会不会再来一次
Who's to say he won't do it again?

497
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,020
没错  布莱克无处不在
That's right. Black could be anywhere.

498
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,080
抓他就像抓烟雾
It's like trying to catch smoke.

499
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,050
用你的手去抓烟雾
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.

500
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,050
发现小天狼星

501
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,280
有意思吧
Intriguing, isn't it?

502
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,290
有人愿意猜一猜
Would anyone like to venture a guess...

503
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,260
里面有什么吗
as to what is inside?

504
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,460
-是博格特  -很好  托马斯先生
- That's a boggart, that is. - Very good, Mr. Thomas.

505
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,130
有人能告诉我博格特长什么样子吗
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?

506
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,360
-没有人知道  -她什么时候来的
- No one knows. -When did she get here?

507
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,110
博格特会变形
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

508
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,500
变成面前的人最害怕的事物
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.

509
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:44,180
-所以它很  -可怕  是的
- That's what makes them so-- - So terrifying, yes, yes, yes....

510
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,620
幸亏  有条很简单的咒语可以对付它
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.

511
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,990
来练习一下  先不要用魔杖
Let's practice it now. Without wands, please.

512
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,790
跟我念  滑稽滑稽
After me. Riddikulus!

513
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,090
-滑稽滑稽  -很好
- Riddikulus! - Very good.

514
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,830
大点声  吐字清楚些  这样
A little louder and very clear. Listen:

515
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,160
-滑稽滑稽  -滑稽滑稽
- Riddikulus! - Riddikulus!

516
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,460
-我看这门课才滑稽  -很好
- This class is ridiculous. - Very good.

517
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,660
这是简单的部分
So much for the easy part. You see,

518
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
但光念咒语是不够的
the incantation alone is not enough.

519
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,610
打败博格特的终极方法就是大笑
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.

520
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,250
尽力把它变成好笑的东西
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.

521
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,550
我先做个示范  纳威  你来吧
Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?

522
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,090
来  别怕  来吧
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

523
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,790
来啊
Come on.

524
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,720
纳威  告诉我你最害怕什么
Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?

525
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,590
斯内普教授
Professor Snape.

526
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,660
-什么  -斯内普教授
- Sorry? - Professor Snape.

527
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,240
斯内普教授  是啊  大家都怕他
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

528
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,370
你和奶奶住在一起吧
You live with your grandmother.

529
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,900
是的  我也不想博格特变成她
Yes. I don't want it to turn into her, either.

530
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,000
不
No...

531
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,610
不会的  我要你想象一下奶奶穿的衣服
it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.

532
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,110
只想衣服  一定要非常清晰
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.

533
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,410
-她拿着红色的手提包  -不用说出来
- She carries a red handbag-- - We don't need to hear.

534
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
你能想出来  我们就能看见
As long as you see it, we'll see it.

535
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,460
打开柜子的时候
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

536
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,890
我要你这么做  不好意思
...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.

537
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,300
想象斯内普教授穿奶奶衣服的样子
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.

538
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,200
行吗
Can you do that?

539
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,500
好的  魔杖准备
Yes. Wand at the ready.

540
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,330
一  二  三
One, two, three.

541
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,050
想  纳威  快想
Think, Neville, think.

542
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,850
滑稽滑稽
Riddikulus!

543
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,060
非常好  纳威  非常好
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! Incredible! Okay...

544
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,170
回去吧  纳威  大家排成队
...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line....

545
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,740
排好队
Form a line!

546
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,350
请大家想一想自己最怕的事物
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...

547
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,610
再把它变得很可笑
...and turn it into something funny.

548
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,550
下一个  罗恩
Next! Ron!

549
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,250
集中精神  勇敢点面对恐惧
Concentrate. Face your fear. Be brave!

550
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,260
魔杖准备  罗恩
Wand at the ready, Ron.

551
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,840
滑稽滑稽
Riddikulus!

552
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,370
真棒
Yes!

553
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,910
非常好
You see? Very good, very good!

554
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:35,220
真是厉害  非常好笑  下一个  帕瓦蒂
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

555
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,220
看看你怕什么
Show us what you see.

556
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,900
别紧张  稳住
Keep your nerve. Steady.

557
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,040
滑稽滑稽
Riddikulus!

558
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,040
下一个  往前走
And next! Step up, step up!

559
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,970
非常好
Wonderful, wonderful!

560
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,050
看我
Here!

561
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,730
滑稽滑稽
Riddikulus!

562
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,210
不好意思  今天到此为止了
Right. Sorry about that. That's enough for today.

563
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,350
大家收好课本
Collect your books from the back.

564
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,140
下课了  谢谢  抱歉
That's the end of the lesson. Thank you! Sorry!

565
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,380
抱歉  不能玩物丧志
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.

566
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,390
记住  能去霍格莫德村是一种荣幸
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.

567
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,090
谁在学校表现不好
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way...

568
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,200
就没有权利去了
...that privilege shall not be extended again.

569
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,930
意见表没签字就不能去
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.

570
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,630
这是规定  波特
That's the rule, Potter.

571
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,000
签了字的  跟我走  没签字的  别乱跑
Those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put.

572
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,680
要是您签了  我就能
I thought if you signed it, then I could--

573
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,350
我不能签  必须是父母或监护人
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.

574
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,740
我都不是  就没法签
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.

575
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:20,620
抱歉  波特  我也无能为力
I'm sorry, Potter. That's my final word.

576
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,090
算了  回头见
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

577
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,930
教授  能问你件事吗
Professor, can I ask you something?

578
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,050
你想问为什么我不让你面对博格特
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?

579
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,650
一开始我想当然
I thought it'd be obvious.

580
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,650
以为博格特要变成伏地魔
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.

581
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,310
我先想的也是他
I did think of Voldemort at first.

582
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:56,150
但一想起那天晚上火车上
But then I remembered that night on the train...

583
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,850
-摄魂怪  -不错
- ...and the dementor. - I'm very impressed.

584
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,930
这说明你害怕的正是恐惧本身
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.

585
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,530
很明智
This is very wise.

586
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,760
我昏过去之前
Before I fainted...

587
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,040
有个声音
...I heard something.

588
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,200
一个女人
A woman...

589
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,010
在尖叫
...screaming.

590
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,440
摄魂怪让人回想起自己最糟糕的记忆
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.

591
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,610
我们的痛苦成了他们的力量
Our pain becomes their power.

592
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,640
我觉得是我妈妈
I think it was my mother...

593
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,050
在她被害的那晚
...the night she was murdered.

594
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,710
第一次见面
The very first time I saw you,

595
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,130
我就认出了你
Harry, I recognized you immediately.

596
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:33,560
不是伤疤  是你的眼睛
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

597
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,130
跟你妈妈莉莉的一样
They're your mother, Lily's.

598
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,500
是啊
Yes.

599
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,840
没错  我认识她
Oh, yes. I knew her.

600
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,010
当年没人理我的时候  是她一直支持着我
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.

601
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,440
她不仅是个天赋出众的女巫
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch...

602
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,980
还是个非常好心的人
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.

603
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,040
她有能力发现那些
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially,

604
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,820
甚至别人自己都忽视了的闪光点
when that person could not see it in themselves.

605
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,990
但是你爸爸詹姆
And your father, James, on the other hand...

606
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,690
他呢
...he....

607
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,570
这么说吧  天赋就是惹麻烦
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.

608
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:22,340
据说这个天赋他传给你了
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.

609
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,350
你和他们真是太像了  哈利
You're more like them than you know, Harry.

610
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,320
总有一天你会发现的
In time, you'll come to see just how much.

611
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:38,220
蜂蜜公爵糖果店真棒
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,

612
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,660
但是佐科笑料商店最厉害
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

613
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,890
尖叫棚屋还没去过
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.

614
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,130
-据说那是  -英国闹鬼最厉害的地方  我知道
- You heard it's the most-- - Haunted building in Britain. I know.

615
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,010
怎么回事
What's going on?

616
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,610
纳威又忘了口令吧
Probably Neville forgot the password again.

617
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,240
你在这啊
Oh, you're there.

618
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,710
让我过去  我是男学生会主席
Let me through, please. Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

619
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,910
都回去
Get back, all of you.

620
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,250
先彻底搜查  不许任何人进入
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.

621
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,760
胖夫人  她不见了
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

622
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,330
正好  她唱歌太难听了
Serves her right. She was a terrible singer.

623
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,400
这不是闹着玩的  罗恩
It's not funny, Ron.

624
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,500
大家冷静  四人一组回到公共休息室
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours. Back to your common room.

625
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:28,840
-安静  -让路
- Be quiet. - Make way.

626
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,070
-校长来了  -让路
- The headmaster's here. - Come on, move.

627
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,180
听到没  让路
You heard. Move!

628
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,260
费尔奇先生  召集鬼魂
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

629
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,110
让他们搜遍城堡里的画
Tell them to search every

630
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:54,700
找到胖夫人
painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

631
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,970
不用找鬼魂了教授
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

632
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,940
胖夫人就在那
The Fat Lady's there.

633
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:03,710
看着路  慢点
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

634
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,940
我可是男学生会主席
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

635
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,580
快走
Keep moving!

636
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,060
亲爱的胖夫人  这是谁干的
Dear lady, who did this to you?

637
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,990
他有恶魔的眼睛  黑暗的灵魂  跟他的姓氏一样
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.

638
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,990
小天狼星布莱克的姓布莱克即是黑暗的意思

639
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,940
就是他  校长  大家都在说的那个人
It's him, headmaster. The one they all talk about.

640
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,570
他到城堡里来了
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

641
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,970
小天狼星布莱克
Sirius Black!

642
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,310
费尔奇先生  戒严城堡  其余的人去大厅
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

643
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,320
天文塔搜过了
I've searched the Astronomy Tower

644
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,380
猫头鹰棚屋也搜过了  没有
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

645
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,070
-谢谢  -三楼也没有
- Thank you. - The third floor's clear too, sir.

646
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,250
-很好  -地下室搜过了
- Very good. - I've done the dungeons.

647
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,080
没有  别的地方也没发现
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.

648
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,820
我觉得他也不会久留
I didn't really expect him to linger.

649
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,390
真是厉害  您说呢
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

650
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,860
单枪匹马闯进霍格沃茨
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...

651
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,690
-还不留痕迹  -的确很厉害
- ...completely undetected? - Quite remarkable, yes.

652
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:31,730
您推测他是怎么进来的
Any theories on how he managed it?

653
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,900
有很多可能性  不过都不现实
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

654
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,700
您还记得
You may recall...

655
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,710
开学前我说的
...prior to the start of term I expressed concerns...

656
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:41,940
担心那位教授
...about your appointment of Professor--

657
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,760
霍格沃茨的任何一位教授
Not a single professor inside

658
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,210
都不会把小天狼星放进来
this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.

659
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,820
我坚信这里还是安全的
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

660
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,610
应该让大家回各自学院了
...and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses.

661
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,120
波特呢  要警告他吗
What about Potter? Should he be warned?

662
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,950
也许吧  现在让他安睡吧
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

663
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,460
梦里是一个属于我们的世界
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.

664
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,760
让他们在海里畅游
Let them swim in the deepest ocean

665
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,260
在空中翱翔吧
or glide over the highest cloud.

666
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,980
翻到第394页
Turn to page 394.

667
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,950
抱歉  先生  卢平教授呢
Excuse me, sir. Where's Professor Lupin?

668
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,100
波特  这不关你的事吧
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?

669
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,500
这么说吧
Suffice it to say your

670
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,130
你们的教授目前的状况
professor finds himself incapable of teaching...

671
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:17,400
不适宜授课  翻到394页
...at the present time. Turn to page 394.

672
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,910
狼人
"Werewolves"?

673
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,010
可是我们刚学完红帽子和辛克庞克
But sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.

674
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,380
-狼人是很久以后的课程了  -安静
- We're not meant to start that for weeks. - Quiet.

675
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,750
她什么时候来的  你看到了吗
When did she come in? Did you see her come in?

676
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,880
好了  谁能告诉我阿尼玛格斯
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference...

677
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,530
和狼人的区别
...between an Animagus and a werewolf?

678
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,170
没人吗
No one?

679
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,570
-真失望  -让我说吧
- How disappointing. - Please, sir.

680
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,930
阿尼玛格斯是巫师主动变形的
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.

681
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,660
狼人则是被迫的
A werewolf has no choice.

682
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,770
每次满月  狼人就变形
With each full moon when he transforms...

683
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,880
他会忘记自己  甚至杀害亲友
...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend.

684
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,610
而且狼人只会回应同类的呼唤
Furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.

685
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,520
谢谢  马尔福先生  这是你第二次
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. That's the second time...

686
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,020
未经允许擅自发言了  格兰杰小姐
...you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.

687
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,190
你是控制不住自己
Are you incapable of restraining yourself...

688
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,690
还是特别喜欢当个讨人厌的万事通
...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?

689
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,400
-他说的还有点道理  -格兰芬多扣5分
- He's got a point, you know. - Five points from Gryffindor.

690
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,820
为了让你们理解深刻
As an antidote to your ignorance,

691
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,200
周一早上交给我一篇
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

692
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,100
关于狼人的论文  两卷羊皮纸
...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...

693
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,870
-重点写识别狼人  -明天有魁地奇
- ...on recognizing it. - It's Quidditch tomorrow.

694
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,310
那你可要加小心了  波特先生
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.

695
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,540
断胳膊断腿也得交作业
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

696
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,550
394页
Page 394.

697
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:43,960
"狼人"这个词
The term "Werewolf"...

698
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,420
是由盎格鲁撒克逊语"Wer"
...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word " Wer"...

699
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,600
也就是人  和狼组成  人狼  也就是狼人
...which means "Man," And "Wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf.

700
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,610
要变成狼人有多种途径
There are several ways to become a werewolf.

701
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,810
包括变形术
They include being given the power of shape-shifting...

702
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,940
被狼人咬
...being bitten by a werewolf....

703
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,400
加油  哈利  加油
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

704
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,020
速坠放缓
Aresto momentum!

705
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,390
-他脸色有点惨白  -惨白
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? - Peaky?

706
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,860
还能怎么样  他从几十米高摔下来了
What do you expect? He fell over 100 feet.

707
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,900
明天让你从塔顶摔一次  看你什么样
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.

708
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,160
估计比现在帅
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

709
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,810
-感觉怎么样  -好极了
- How are you feeling? - Oh, brilliant.

710
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,980
你可把我们吓坏了  哥们
You gave us a right good scare there, mate.

711
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,720
-怎么回事  -你从扫帚上摔下去了
- What happened? - Well, you fell off your broom.

712
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,350
是吗  我是问比赛谁赢了
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

713
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,420
大家都不怪你  哈利
No one blames you, Harry.

714
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,080
摄魂怪是不可以
Dementors aren't supposed

715
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,460
进入校园的  邓布利多气坏了
to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

716
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,760
把你安顿好  他就把摄魂怪赶走了
After he saved you, he sent them off.

717
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,600
还有件事得告诉你
There's something else you should know too.

718
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:17,410
你掉下来的时候
When you fell, your broom

719
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:21,470
你的扫帚被吹到打人柳那了
sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and....

720
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,480
然后
Well....

721
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,080
扫帚的事很抱歉
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.

722
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,750
修不好吗
Is there no chance of fixing it?

723
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,590
嗯
No.

724
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:35,090
教授  为什么摄魂怪对我影响这么大
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?

725
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:38,590
-比别人都大  -是这样
- I mean, more than everyone else? - Listen.

726
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,920
摄魂怪是最邪恶的生物
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.

727
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:46,360
他们吸食所有美好的感觉  回忆
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...

728
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,500
只给人留下最痛苦的经历
...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.

729
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,940
并不是你脆弱  哈利
You are not weak, Harry.

730
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,630
摄魂怪对你影响大
Dementors affect you most

731
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,170
是因为你遭遇过的不幸
because there are true horrors in your past.

732
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,440
你的同学是无法想象的
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.

733
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,220
没必要感到羞愧
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

734
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,450
-我很害怕  教授  -不怕就奇怪了
- I'm scared, professor. - I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

735
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,120
我要学会对抗他们  你可以教我
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me.

736
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,300
火车上那个就是你赶跑的
You made the one on the train go away.

737
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,260
那天只有一个
There was only one that night.

738
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,320
那你也赶跑了
But you made it go away.

739
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,130
我不是跟你显摆专业知识
I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

740
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:28,440
不过既然摄魂怪对你特别有兴趣
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...

741
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,270
我确实该教你  但是等寒假之后吧
...perhaps I should teach you. But after the holidays.

742
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,380
现在  我需要休息
For now, I need to rest.

743
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,040
去霍格莫德的最后一趟  快点
Last call for Hogsmeade! Come on, now!

744
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,700
-放开我  -挺聪明  哈利
- Guys, let me go. - Clever, Harry.

745
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,770
-但还不够聪明  -我们有更好的办法
- But not clever enough. - Besides, we've got a better way.

746
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,770
-我要去霍格莫德  -我们知道
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. -We know.

747
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,300
别担心  我们能送你进去
Don't worry, we'll get you there.

748
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,030
-有条捷径  -但你得消停下来
- We'll show you a quicker way. - If you pipe down.

749
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,800
-真可怜  -放开我  别这样
- Bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't--

750
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,010
-哈利  -来跟大哥哥们玩吧
- Now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys.

751
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,540
你们干什么
What are you doing?!

752
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,650
-这什么破玩意  -居然说是破玩意
- What's this rubbish? - "What's this rubbish? " He says.

753
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:47,500
这是我们成功的秘诀
It's the secret to our success.

754
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,150
虽然不舍得
It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.

755
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,260
但是我们认为  还是你更需要它
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.

756
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,160
乔治  请吧
George, if you will.

757
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,630
我庄严宣誓我不怀好意
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

758
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,870
月亮脸  虫尾巴  大脚板和尖头叉子先生
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...

759
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,280
很荣幸的为您奉上活点地图
...are proud to present the Marauder's Map."

760
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,740
真是多亏了他们
We owe them so much.

761
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:18,150
等等  这是霍格沃茨  那个
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that--

762
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,050
-不会是  -邓布利多
- No. Is that really--? - Dumbledore.

763
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,230
-在书房  -踱步
- In his study. - Pacing.

764
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,420
他经常那样
Does that a lot.

765
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,420
阿布思・邓布利多

766
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,460
-这张地图能显示  -所有人  -所有人吗
- So this map shows--? - Everyone.  - Everyone?

767
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,670
-在哪  -干什么
- Where they are. - What they're doing.

768
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:29,960
-每时  -每刻
- Every minute. - Every day.

769
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,140
-真厉害  哪来的  -当然是从费尔奇办公室偷的
- Brilliant! Where did you get it? - Nicked from Filch's office, of course.

770
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,030
-一年级时  -有七条秘密通道
- First year. - There are seven secret passageways...

771
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,870
-能出城堡  -我们推荐这条
- ...out of the castle. - We'd recommend this one.

772
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,200
-独眼女巫通道  -通向蜂蜜公爵的地下室
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway. - Leads you to Honeyduke's cellar.

773
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,210
快点  费尔奇过来了
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

774
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:47,850
别忘了  用完了地图  用魔杖点一下说
Oh, Harry, don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:

775
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,350
恶作剧完毕  不然就给别人发现了
"Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it.

776
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,850
你要多少
Now, how much do you want?

777
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,070
真好吃
Delicious.

778
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,490
这是英国
It's meant to be the most

779
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:51,140
闹鬼最厉害的屋子  我说过吗
haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?

780
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,010
两次了
Twice.

781
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,080
想靠近点看吗
Do you want to move a bit closer?

782
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,980
看尖叫棚屋
To the Shrieking Shack?

783
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,150
我在这就好
Actually, I'm fine here.

784
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,090
看看这是谁
Well, well. Look who's here.

785
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,760
你们俩看新房子呢
You two shopping for your new dream home?

786
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,260
有点大了吧  韦瑟比
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?

787
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
你家人是不是都睡一间屋子里
Don't your family sleep in one room?

788
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,700
-闭嘴  马尔福  -好凶啊
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy. - Not very friendly.

789
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,870
兄弟们
Boys, I think it's time we

790
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:19,100
来教韦瑟比怎么尊敬长辈
teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

791
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,780
-你管自己叫长辈吗  -你敢跟我说话
- Hope you don't mean yourself. - How dare you talk to me!

792
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,910
肮脏的泥巴种
You filthy little mudblood!

793
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:30,650
谁啊
Who is that?

794
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,290
-别傻站着啊  干点什么  -干什么
- Don't stand there! Do something! - What?

795
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,410
马尔福  雪橇丢了吗
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

796
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,750
让开
Get out of the way!

797
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,820
让开
Move!

798
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,990
马尔福  等等  等等
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

799
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,700
哈利
Harry!

800
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:21,930
吓死人了  哈利  一点也不好玩
Bloody hell, Harry. That was not funny.

801
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,600
这两个坏蛋  从来没跟我提过活点地图
Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.

802
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,980
哈利肯定不自己留着  交给麦格教授吧
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.

803
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,180
-是吧  -连隐形衣一块交了算了
- Aren't you? - Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

804
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,850
看那是谁  罗斯默塔夫人
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

805
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,380
-罗恩可迷恋她了  -谁说的
- Ron fancies her. - That's not true!

806
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:41,420
-麦格教授  -康奈利
- Professor McGonagall! - Cornelius!

807
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,990
我来吧  部长
Allow me, minister.

808
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:45,020
-海格啊  -抱歉
- Oh, Hagrid.... - Sorry about that.

809
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,160
亲爱的罗斯默塔  生意还好吧
Rosmerta, my dear. I hope business is good.

810
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,230
要不是摄魂怪天天来酒吧搜查
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...

811
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,430
-肯定好得不得了  -有个
- ...into my pub every other night! - We have....

812
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,070
-有个在逃杀人犯  -小天狼星布莱克在霍格莫德吗
- We have a killer on the loose. - Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

813
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,910
他为什么来这
And what would bring him here?

814
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,140
-哈利・波特  -哈利・波特吗
- Harry Potter. - Harry Potter?

815
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,110
来吧
Come.

816
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,660
哈利
Harry!

817
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,840
-今天未成年巫师禁止进入  -快关门
- No underage wizards allowed in today! - Shut the damn door!

818
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,040
-真没礼貌  -蠢货
- So rude. - Thick heads.

819
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:29,860
-说谁蠢货  -好大的胆子
- Thick heads?! - How dare they!

820
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:33,230
-敢说我们蠢货  -两个小毛孩子
- Who are they calling thick heads? - Young whippersnappers!

821
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,480
大家魂都吓丢了
Nobody will come to a pub

822
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,950
谁还来酒吧啊
where they'll get scared out of their wits.

823
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,050
邓布利多教授不希望摄魂怪在附近
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.

824
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,620
说说怎么回事吧
Tell me what this is all about.

825
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,600
十几年前  哈利・波特的父母
Years ago, when Harry Potter's

826
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,260
发现自己被神秘人追杀时
parents realized they were marked for death--

827
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,090
记得吗  他们藏起来了  几乎没人知道在哪
Remember? They hid. Few knew where they were.

828
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:58,130
只有小天狼星布莱克知道  他告诉神秘人了
One who did was Sirius Black. And he told You-Know-Who.

829
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,570
布莱克不仅给神秘人带了路
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...

830
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,040
还杀了他们的朋友  小矮星彼得
...he also killed one of their friends Peter Pettigrew!

831
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,440
-小矮星彼得  -矮矮胖胖的
- Peter Pettigrew? - Little lump of a boy.

832
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,870
-布莱克的小跟班  -有印象
- Always trailing after Sirius Black. - I remember.

833
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,880
老是跟着詹姆和小天狼星
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.

834
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,810
-发生什么了  -彼得想去警告波特夫妇
- What happened? - Peter tried to warn the Potters...

835
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:16,410
但是只差一点
...and might have,

836
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,180
因为撞到了老伙计布莱克
had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

837
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,220
布莱克太邪恶了  他没杀掉小矮星
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew.

838
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,590
他把他毁了
He destroyed him!

839
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,960
一根手指  最后只剩一根手指
A finger. That's all that was left. A finger. Nothing else.

840
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:34,160
就算布莱克没亲手杀害波特夫妇
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...

841
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:37,570
-他也是罪魁祸首  -现在他来清除后患了
- ...but he's the reason they're dead. - And now he wants to finish what he's started.

842
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,610
-真不敢相信  -更糟糕的是
- I don't believe it. - That's not the worst of it.

843
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,580
-还有更糟糕的吗  -小天狼星布莱克
- What could be worse? - This: Sirius Black was...

844
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,910
以前是  现在也是
...and remains to this day...

845
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,980
哈利・波特的教父
...Harry Potter's godfather!

846
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,960
快看
Ron, look!

847
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,200
-不好意思  借过  -圣诞快乐
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Merry Christmas.

848
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:48,510
怎么回事  哈利
Harry, what happened?

849
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,140
他是他们的朋友
He was their friend...

850
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,910
却背叛了他们
...and he betrayed them.

851
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,690
他是他们的朋友
He was their friend!

852
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,890
他赶紧来找我
I hope he finds me.

853
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,790
一见到他  我就要决一死战
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!

854
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,860
一见到他  我就要杀了他
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

855
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:24,770
哈利
Harry.

856
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:26,910
你还是来了
There you are. You came.

857
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:31,220
你确定要学吗  这可是很高深的魔法
Are you sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic...

858
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,860
完全超越了普通巫师等级考试范围
...well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.

859
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,550
是的
I'm sure.

860
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,590
那就开始吧
Well, everything's prepared.

861
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,230
我要教你的这个咒语  叫守护神咒
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.

862
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,900
听说过吗
Did you ever hear of it?

863
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,730
没有吗
No? Well....

864
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,620
守护神是一股力量
A Patronus is a positive force.

865
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,460
像是一个护盾
For the wizard who conjures one...

866
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:51,300
保护着召唤它的巫师
...it works like a shield,

867
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,300
挡在他和摄魂怪之间
with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.

868
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:58,350
但是要成功召唤出来  需要一段回忆
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.

869
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:02,450
不是普通的回忆  要快乐  要有力量
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.

870
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,420
行吗  很好
Can you do this? Yes. Very well.

871
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,850
闭上眼睛
Close your eyes.

872
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,530
集中精神
Concentrate.

873
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,860
回忆过去
Explore your past.

874
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,230
找到了吗
Do you have a memory?

875
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,030
让自己沉浸其中
Allow it to fill you up.

876
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,830
忘记自我
Lose yourself within it.

877
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:31,510
然后说出咒语  呼神护卫
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.

878
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,780
-呼神护卫  -很好
- Expecto Patronum. - Very good.

879
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,920
开始吧  魔杖准备
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

880
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:02,340
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum!

881
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,480
呼神  呼神
Expecto.... Expecto....

882
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,410
呼神
Expect....

883
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:14,480
好了  坐起来  深呼吸
Here we go. Come on. Sit up. Deep breaths.

884
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,590
没事  我也没指望你第一次就成功
It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.

885
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,460
不然也太厉害了
That would have been remarkable.

886
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,130
吃点吧  有好处
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

887
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,830
-这摄魂怪真厉害  -不不不
- That's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no.

888
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:30,800
那还只是个博格特
That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.

889
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,140
真的摄魂怪要可怕的多
The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse.

890
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,940
纯属好奇  你刚想的是什么
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?

891
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,810
-选了哪段回忆  -第一次骑飞天扫帚
- Which memory did you choose? - The first time I rode a broom.

892
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:45,380
这可不够  还差得远呢
That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough.

893
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:57,530
还有一段  不算是快乐
There's another. It's not happy, exactly.

894
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,560
算是吧
Well, it is.

895
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:04,330
那是我感觉最快乐的时候
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

896
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:08,480
-但是很复杂  -很强大吗
- ...but it's complicated. - Is it strong?

897
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,710
那就试试吧  准备好了吗
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

898
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,250
开始吧
Just do it.

899
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,560
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum!

900
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,770
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum!

901
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,490
很好
Yes!

902
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,800
非常好  哈利  非常好
Well done, Harry. Well done!

903
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:10,470
-今天就到这吧  -好啊  坐下
- I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. Sit down. Here.

904
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,070
吃点  特别管用
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

905
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,010
跟你说  哈利
And just so you know, Harry...

906
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,740
我觉得
...I think you'd have given

907
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,180
你绝对不比你爸爸差
your father a run for his money. And that...

908
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,410
这个评价可不低
...is saying something.

909
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,590
我想的就是他
I was thinking of him.

910
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,950
还有妈妈
And Mum.

911
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,350
想象他们的脸庞
Seeing their faces.

912
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:33,690
他们对我说话
They were talking to me.

913
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,130
只是说话
Just talking.

914
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:38,630
我选了这段记忆
That's the memory I chose.

915
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,700
都不一定是真的
I don't even know if it's real.

916
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,370
却是最美好的
But it's the best I have.

917
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,950
-天气挺好  -是挺好
- Beautiful day. - Gorgeous.

918
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,120
被撕成碎片就不好了
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

919
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,720
撕成碎片  你说什么呢
Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?

920
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,980
-罗恩把他的耗子弄丢了  -不是我弄丢的
- Ronald has lost his rat. - I haven't lost anything!

921
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,290
-你的猫弄死的  -胡说
- Your cat killed him! - Rubbish.

922
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,800
哈利  你知道他那只凶巴巴的猫
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

923
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,870
成天惦记着斑斑  现在斑斑不见了
...is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone.

924
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:17,900
应该是你太不关心它了
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!

925
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,170
-你的猫弄死的  -不是
- Your cat killed him! - Did not.

926
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,840
-就是  -不是
- Did. - Didn't.

927
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,510
怎么样  海格  听证会
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

928
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:30,010
首先呢  各位成员轮流发言
Well, first off, the committee members took turns...

929
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,850
说明听证会的目的
...talking about why we were there.

930
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,390
然后轮到我  我说巴克比克
I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak...

931
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:40,530
是只善良的鹰头马身有翼兽  总爱清理自己的羽毛
...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.

932
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,760
接着是卢修斯・马尔福  你们也猜得到
And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine.

933
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:47,130
他说巴克比克是非常危险的生物
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...

934
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,360
看到谁就弄死谁
...who would kill you as soon as look at you.

935
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:52,370
然后呢
And then?

936
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:55,770
然后他要求严肃处理
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.

937
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,070
-他们不能开除你  -不是开除我
- They're not sacking you! - No, I'm not sacked.

938
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,120
巴克比克被判了死刑
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

939
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,810
蜘蛛  有蜘蛛
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.

940
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,540
蜘蛛要我跳踢踏舞
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

941
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:40,310
-可是我不想跳  -那你告诉蜘蛛啊
- I don't wanna tap-dance! - You tell those spiders.

942
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,490
是啊  我告诉他们去
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....

943
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,490
阿格斯・费尔奇

944
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,490
小矮星彼得

945
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,740
-小矮星彼得  -矮矮胖胖的
- Peter Pettigrew - Little lump of a boy.

946
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:08,040
-布莱克的小跟班  -布莱克太邪恶了
- Always trailing after Sirius Black. - Black was vicious.

947
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,750
他没杀掉小矮星  他把他毁了
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!

948
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,300
-把灯熄了  -抱歉
- Put that light out! - Sorry.

949
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,500
哈利・波特    小矮星彼得

950
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:09,640
-注意点孩子  -我们在休息呢  -就是
- Watch it there, boy. - We're trying to sleep here!  - Yes, we are.

951
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,500
西弗勒斯・斯内普

952
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,480
恶作剧完毕  诺克斯
Mischief managed. Nox.

953
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:24,020
波特
Potter.

954
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:27,680
这么晚了在走廊晃悠什么
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?

955
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,920
梦游
I was sleepwalking.

956
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,690
你真是太像你爸爸了  波特
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.

957
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:36,670
在城堡里趾高气昂的闲逛
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.

958
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:41,210
我爸爸哪有趾高气昂  我也没有
My dad didn't strut. And nor do l.

959
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:43,000
不好意思
Now, if you don't mind,

960
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
请您把魔杖放低点
I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

961
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,420
兜里东西掏出来
Turn out your pockets.

962
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,720
快掏出来
Turn out your pockets!

963
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,250
这是什么
What's this?

964
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,690
-空白的羊皮纸  -真的吗  打开
- Spare bit of parchment. - Really? Open it.

965
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,800
秘密显形
Reveal your secrets.

966
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,180
念出来
Read it.

967
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:26,110
月亮脸  虫尾巴  大脚板和尖头叉子先生
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...

968
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,420
向斯内普教授致敬
...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...."

969
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,230
继续
Go on.

970
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,800
并请他不要顶着大鼻子
"And request he keep his

971
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,260
多管闲事
large nose out of other people's business."

972
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,030
-你个无耻的小  -教授
- You insolent little-- - Professor!

973
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:44,370
是卢平啊
Well, well. Lupin.

974
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:49,240
沐浴着月光  出来散步吗
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?

975
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,080
哈利  你没事吧
Harry, are you all right?

976
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,750
还说不准
That remains to be seen.

977
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,320
我从他手里没收了件有意思的东西
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.

978
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,960
看看吧  卢平  你应该擅长这个
Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise.

979
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,650
肯定满是黑魔法
Clearly, it's full of dark magic.

980
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,930
我看不像  西弗勒斯
I seriously doubt it, Severus.

981
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:12,590
应该是卷谁想看就骂谁的羊皮纸
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone...

982
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,640
估计是佐科的产品
...who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product.

983
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:21,070
然而  我还是拿回去进一步研究一下吧
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.

984
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:24,370
你说的对  我比较擅长这个
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.

985
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:27,910
哈利  跟我来吧  晚安教授
Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.

986
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,650
你聋子吗  把灯熄了
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

987
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,200
进来
Come in.

988
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,970
我不知道
I haven't the faintest idea

989
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:50,200
你是怎么拿到这地图的
how this map came to be in your possession...

990
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,880
但你居然没想着交上来
...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.

991
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,060
你想没想过这地图
Did it never occur to you that this,

992
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,740
落到小天狼星手里
in the hands of Sirius Black...

993
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,920
他就能找到你吗
...is a map to you?

994
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,150
-没有吗  -没有
- No. - No, sir.

995
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:09,180
你爸爸也不遵守规则
Your father never set much store by the rules either.

996
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:13,690
但你的父母为了救你献出了生命
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.

997
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,420
有个杀人犯逍遥法外  你还深夜闲逛
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...

998
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:23,170
你就这样回报你父母的牺牲吗
...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!

999
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:25,430
以后我不会再帮你圆谎了
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

1000
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,070
-听到没  -听到了
- Do you hear me? - Yes, sir.

1001
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,870
马上回宿舍  不要出来
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.

1002
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:36,850
别兜圈子  我能看到
And don't take any detours. If you do, I shall know.

1003
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,960
教授  我觉得那地图也有不好用的时候
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.

1004
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:49,860
之前  上边显示了一个人
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.

1005
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,770
但我知道他已经死了
Someone I know to be dead.

1006
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,930
是吗  是谁啊
Oh, really? And who might that be?

1007
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,660
小矮星彼得
Peter Pettigrew.

1008
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,370
不可能
That's not possible.

1009
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,170
反正我看到了
It's just what I saw.

1010
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,740
晚安  教授
Good night, professor.

1011
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:16,420
开阔思维  要放眼未来
Broaden your minds. You must look beyond.

1012
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:22,030
阅读水晶球的关键  是天目要清澈
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

1013
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:25,530
这样才能看见  再试试
Only then can you see. Try again.

1014
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,160
你看到什么了
Now, what do we have here?

1015
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,700
我来吧
Do you mind me trying?

1016
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,110
应该是不祥
The Grim, possibly.

1017
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,380
亲爱的  你刚到我班上来
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...

1018
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,320
我就发现也许你不太适合
...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit...

1019
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,430
学习占卜学这门高尚的课程  你看
...for the noble art of Divination. No, you see, there.

1020
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:57,680
你年纪轻轻  心灵却早已老去
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled as an old maid's,

1021
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,420
你的灵魂像你视为珍宝的典籍一样
your soul as dry as the pages of the books...

1022
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,730
已经无比干枯
...to which you so desperately cleave.

1023
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,290
我说错话了吗
Have I said something?

1024
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,330
赫敏真是疯了
She's gone mental, Hermione has.

1025
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,960
虽然她经常这样
Not that she wasn't always mental...

1026
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:33,690
但这下大家都知道了
...but now it's in the open for everyone to see.

1027
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,030
等等
Hang on.

1028
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:39,140
-还回去吧  -我可不回去
- We better take this back. - I'm not going back.

1029
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,910
-那我先去了  -再见
- Fine. See you later. - See you.

1030
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,920
哈利・波特
Harry Potter....

1031
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:37,060
-特里劳妮教授  -他今晚就会归来
- Professor Trelawney-- - He will return tonight.

1032
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,860
什么
Sorry?

1033
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,600
那个背叛了朋友的
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,

1034
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,700
黑心杀人魔
whose heart rots with murder...

1035
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,900
将重获自由
...shall break free.

1036
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,300
无辜的鲜血会流淌
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

1037
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:54,480
仆人和主子将重新聚首
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.

1038
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:04,050
不好意思亲爱的  你刚说什么了
I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something?

1039
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,660
没
No.

1040
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,650
没说什么
Nothing.

1041
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:05,290
他们竟然要处死巴克比克  真糟糕
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

1042
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:08,180
-更糟糕了  -我就说  我爸说了
- It just got worse. - What did I say? Father said...

1043
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,350
鹰头马身有翼兽的头我可以留着
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.

1044
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,520
我要捐给格兰芬多公共休息室
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

1045
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,160
肯定是份大礼
This is going to be rich.

1046
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,520
-看谁来了  -来看演出的吗
- Look who's here. - Come to see the show?

1047
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,830
你个恶心人的小蟑螂
You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

1048
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,770
别  赫敏
Hermione, no!

1049
01:23:23,370 --> 01:23:25,600
对他不值当的
He's not worth it.

1050
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,780
马尔福  没事吧
Malfoy, are you okay?

1051
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:46,190
-快走  -不许告诉别人  明白吗
- Let's go. Quick. - Not a word to anyone, understood?

1052
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:50,800
-感觉挺好  -岂止是好  酷毙了
- That felt good. - Not good, brilliant.

1053
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:14,490
看他啊  最喜欢风吹过树叶的气息了
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.

1054
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,920
直接放了他多好
Why don't we just set him free?

1055
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:19,530
他们知道肯定是我  邓布利多该有麻烦了
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble.

1056
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:22,700
他也要来的
He's coming down, you know, Dumbledore.

1057
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,230
说要陪我一起看
Says he wants to be with me when they....

1058
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,260
看那件事
When it happens.

1059
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:29,800
真是伟大的人啊  邓布利多
Great man, Dumbledore.

1060
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,330
真伟大
A great man.

1061
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,810
-我们也要陪你  -不行
- We'll stay with you too. - You'll do no such thing!

1062
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:41,140
怎么能让你们看那种场面  不行
Think I want you seeing something like that? No.

1063
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,980
你们喝完茶就走  对了罗恩
You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron....

1064
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,790
斑斑  你还活着
Scabbers! You're alive!

1065
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,690
看好自己的宠物
Keep a closer eye on your pet.

1066
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,660
你是不是该道歉了
I think you owe someone an apology.

1067
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,600
好吧  下次见到克鲁克山我会道歉的
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

1068
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,790
我说的是我
I meant me!

1069
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,700
该死  什么东西
Blimey. What was that?

1070
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,610
海格
Hagrid!

1071
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:17,880
天呐
Oh, crikey.

1072
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:22,080
不  部长  这边
No, minister. Over this way.

1073
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,390
这么晚了  天都要黑了  你们不该在这
It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here.

1074
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,470
被发现了就有麻烦了  大麻烦
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Big trouble.

1075
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:34,090
尤其是你  哈利  马上来
Particularly you, Harry. With you in a moment!

1076
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,940
快点  快点
Quick. Quick!

1077
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,830
海格
Hagrid.

1078
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,980
-没事的  会过去的  -快走
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay. - Go on, go on!

1079
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:48,610
看那颗石楠树  山坡上
That's ling you see over there-- On the slope.

1080
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,450
-山坡上  海格  -邓布利多教授
- On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid. - Professor Dumbledore.

1081
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:54,320
-晚上好  -请进  部长
- Good evening. - Minister. Make your way through.

1082
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,360
-要不要茶  -不了  海格
- Have a tea, if you like. - No, Hagrid.

1083
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,020
-各位  -我要来杯茶
- Gentlemen. - I'd like a cup of tea.

1084
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,500
来说正事吧
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?

1085
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,260
处置危险生物委员会决定
Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...

1086
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:14,600
鹰头马身有翼兽  巴克比克
...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak...

1087
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,560
后称嫌疑兽
...hereinafter called "The condemned,"

1088
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:20,280
应与今天日落时分执行死刑
shall be executed this day at sundown.

1089
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,010
-天呐  -好了  海格  节哀吧
- Dear, dear.... - Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

1090
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:28,620
-没事的  -死刑将由
- All right. It'll be all right. - The execution shall dispatch--

1091
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,520
什么
What?

1092
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:32,790
我好像看见了
I thought I just saw--

1093
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,050
-算了  -走吧
- Never mind. - Let's go!

1094
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,500
巴克比克从不会害人
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

1095
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:29,210
真可惜
Oh, no.

1096
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:43,590
他咬我  斑斑
He bit me. Scabbers.

1097
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:46,130
罗恩  罗恩
Ron. Ron!

1098
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:50,630
-罗恩  -斑斑  回来
- Ron! - Scabbers, come back.

1099
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:53,900
等等
Wait!

1100
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:04,080
-斑斑  为什么咬我  -哈利  你认识这棵树吧
- Scabbers, you bit me! - Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1101
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:06,550
这可不好  罗恩  快跑
That's not good. Ron, run!

1102
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:12,220
哈利  赫敏  快跑
Harry, Hermione, run!

1103
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,420
是不祥
It's the Grim!

1104
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:24,500
-哈利  -罗恩  等等
- Harry! - Ron! Ron, wait!

1105
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,710
哈利
Harry!

1106
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,680
-救命  -罗恩
- Help! - Ron!

1107
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:36,080
-罗恩  -罗恩
- Ron. Ron. - Ron!

1108
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,930
走吧
Come on!

1109
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:56,270
闪开
Move!

1110
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,070
快躲
Duck!

1111
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:40,210
哈利
Harry!

1112
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,100
-真对不起  -没事
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Don't worry.

1113
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,200
-这是通向哪  -我猜到一个地方
- Where do you suppose this goes? - I have a hunch.

1114
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:05,240
但愿我猜错了
I just hope I'm wrong.

1115
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,120
这是尖叫棚屋吧
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

1116
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,820
走吧
Come on.

1117
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,640
罗恩
Ron.

1118
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:45,770
-罗恩  你没事啊  -那条狗在哪
- Ron. You're okay. - The dog. Where is it?

1119
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:49,240
这是陷阱  他就是狗  他是个阿尼玛格斯
It's a trap. He's the dog. He's an Animagus.

1120
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,830
想杀哈利  得先过我俩这关
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!

1121
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,800
今晚只会死一个人
No. Only one will die tonight.

1122
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,940
那就是你
Then it'll be you!

1123
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,300
你真要杀我吗  哈利
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1124
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,380
除你武器
Expelliarmus!

1125
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:29,280
小天狼星  怎么一身破烂啊
Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1126
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,520
你的外表终于跟内心一样疯狂了
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.

1127
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:36,760
还是你的内心最疯狂  莱姆斯
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?

1128
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,170
-我找到他了  -我知道
- I found him. - I know.

1129
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,710
-就在这  -我明白
- He's here. - I understand.

1130
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:53,070
-杀了他吧  -我那么信任你
- Let's kill him! - No! I trusted you!

1131
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:57,250
你居然是他的朋友
And all this time, you've been his friend.

1132
01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:01,010
他是个狼人  所以才会时不时的缺课
He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes.

1133
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,450
你知道多久了
How long have you known?

1134
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:09,160
-从斯内普教授布置论文的时候  -赫敏
- Since Professor Snape set the essay. - Well, Hermione.

1135
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,300
你真是我遇到的最聪明的学生
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.

1136
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,870
别废话了  莱姆斯  赶紧杀了他
Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him!

1137
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,700
-等等  -我等够了
- Wait! - I did my waiting!

1138
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:20,340
等了12年
Twelve years of it!

1139
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:23,340
在阿兹卡班
In Azkaban!

1140
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:34,550
好吧  杀了他吧
Very well. Kill him.

1141
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:38,890
但还得等一下  得告诉哈利为什么
But wait one more minute. Harry has the right to know why.

1142
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,620
我知道为什么
I know why.

1143
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,090
你背叛了我父母
You betrayed my parents.

1144
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,200
-你害死了他们  -不是他
- You're the reason they're dead! - No, it wasn't him.

1145
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,270
的确有人背叛了你父母
Somebody did betray your parents...

1146
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:51,930
我们一直以为他已经死掉了
...somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!

1147
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:55,610
-是谁  -小矮星彼得
- Who was it, then? - Peter Pettigrew!

1148
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,900
他现在就在这屋子里
And he's in this room! Right now!

1149
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,420
出来啊彼得
Come out, come out, Peter!

1150
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,520
-出来一起玩啊  -除你武器
- Come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus!

1151
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:10,960
复仇的滋味真好
Vengeance is sweet.

1152
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,390
我一直盼着亲手抓住你
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

1153
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,890
西弗勒斯
Severus--

1154
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:17,980
我一直跟邓布利多说你在帮老朋友混进来
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle.

1155
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:19,780
终于有证据了
And now, here's the proof.

1156
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,300
真厉害  斯内普
Brilliant, Snape.

1157
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:25,730
不过你聪明的脑瓜还是想错了
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.

1158
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,740
失陪了  莱姆斯和我还有事要做
If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to

1159
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:33,910
给我个理由啊  求你了
Give me a reason. I beg you!

1160
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,670
-西弗勒斯  别犯傻  -他什么时候不傻
- Severus, don't be a fool. - He can't help it. It's habit.

1161
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,480
-别说话  -你闭嘴  莱姆斯
- Be quiet. - Be quiet yourself, Remus!

1162
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:41,090
看看你俩  跟老两口一样拌嘴
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.

1163
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:43,780
你还是回去玩你的化学仪器去吧
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set!

1164
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:46,830
别以为我不会下手
I could do it, you know.

1165
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:52,930
但摄魂怪们可是很想你啊
But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you.

1166
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:55,800
好像有丝恐惧的味道
Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes.

1167
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,460
摄魂怪的吻  那滋味真是不可想象
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.

1168
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:04,500
都说场面不堪入目  但我还是要尽量看完
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.

1169
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,480
西弗勒斯  别这样
Severus, please.

1170
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:10,520
你先走
After you.

1171
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:16,680
除你武器
Expelliarmus!

1172
01:34:18,490 --> 01:34:21,980
-哈利  你干什么  -你袭击老师了
- Harry! What did you just do? -You attacked a teacher!

1173
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,820
-说说彼得的事  -他当年是我们的同学
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew. - He was at school with us.

1174
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:26,660
还以为他是朋友
We thought he was our friend!

1175
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,840
-小矮星死了  你杀的  -不是
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't.

1176
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,200
我也以为是  但你说在地图上看见他了
I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!

1177
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:36,200
-地图在说谎  -地图从来不说谎
- The map was lying, then. - The map never lies!

1178
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,410
小矮星没死  他就在那
Pettigrew's alive! And he's right there!

1179
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,480
-我吗  你疯了吧  -不是你  你的耗子
- Me?! He's mental! - Not you! Your rat!

1180
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,880
-斑斑在我们家待了  -12年了吗
- Scabbers has been in my family for-- - Twelve years?

1181
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:51,560
普通的耗子能活这么久吗
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!

1182
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,320
-他是不是还少了根趾头  -那又怎么样
- He's missing a toe, isn't he? - So what?

1183
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,460
-他们只找到了  -手指
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his-- - Finger!

1184
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,900
那个胆小鬼切了根手指  假装自己死了
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!

1185
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,040
-然后变形  变成了只耗子  -证明给我看
- And then he transformed into a rat! - Show me.

1186
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:09,700
-给他吧  罗恩  -你要干什么
- Give it to him, Ron. - What are you trying to do to him?

1187
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,970
斑斑
Scabbers!

1188
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:14,200
放开他  你要干什么
Leave him alone! Get off him! What are you doing?

1189
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:38,570
莱姆斯
Remus?

1190
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:40,840
小天狼星
Sirius.

1191
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,940
老伙计们
My old friends!

1192
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:52,420
哈利  看看你  真像你爸爸
Harry! Look at you. You look so much like your father.

1193
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:56,240
-詹姆  我们是好朋友  -你敢跟哈利说话
- Like James. We were the best of friends-- -How dare you speak to Harry!

1194
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,720
还敢跟他说詹姆吗
How dare you talk about James in front of him!

1195
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:05,060
-你把詹姆和莉莉出卖给伏地魔了  -我不是有意的
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort! - I didn't mean to!

1196
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,060
谁知道黑魔王有什么武器
The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!

1197
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,900
小天狼星  换你你会怎么做
Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done?

1198
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:16,870
-你会怎么做  -我宁死也不背叛朋友
- What would you have done? - I'd die, I'd die rather than betray my friends!

1199
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:21,450
哈利  詹姆不会要我死掉的
Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed!

1200
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:27,320
你父亲会饶恕我的  他会饶恕我的
Your dad would have spared me! He would have shown me mercy!

1201
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:32,240
你明白  就算伏地魔没杀你  我们也要杀  一起
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1202
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,250
不要
No!

1203
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,730
-哈利  这个人  -我知道
- Harry, this man-- - I know what he is.

1204
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,800
我们带他去城堡
But we'll take him to the castle.

1205
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,030
-保佑你  保佑你  -让开
- Bless you, boy. Bless you! - Get off!

1206
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,610
我们带你去城堡
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1207
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:53,170
把你交给摄魂怪
After that, the dementors can have you.

1208
01:36:57,010 --> 01:37:00,170
抱歉咬了你  是不是有点疼
Sorry about the bite. I reckon that twinges a bit.

1209
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:04,490
有点  还有点  你差点把我腿扯下来
A bit? A bit? You almost tore my leg off!

1210
01:37:04,690 --> 01:37:06,220
我是冲着耗子去的
I was going for the rat.

1211
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:10,230
一般来说我变狗很温柔的
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.

1212
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:15,630
詹姆都劝我干脆不要变回来了
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.

1213
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:20,670
长条尾巴没什么  但是跳蚤真要命
The tail I could live with. But the fleas, they're murder.

1214
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,790
好了
Okay.

1215
01:37:39,830 --> 01:37:42,320
-你去吧  -我没关系的
- You better go. - No. Don't worry, okay?

1216
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:43,900
没关系  我不去
It's fine. I'll stay.

1217
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:46,670
去吧  有我在
You go, I'll stay.

1218
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,100
-没事吧  -没事  快去
- You okay? - I'm fine. Go.

1219
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:54,680
-看着好严重  -疼死了
- That looks really painful. - So painful.

1220
01:37:54,910 --> 01:37:57,400
没准要截肢
They might chop it.

1221
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:00,570
庞弗雷夫人肯定一下子就能治好
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.

1222
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:04,880
太晚了  肯定要截肢
It's too late. It's ruined. It'll have to be chopped off.

1223
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:07,980
真美啊
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1224
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:12,590
我永远也忘不了第一次走进城堡
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.

1225
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:16,460
等自由了再走一次肯定很好
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.

1226
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,400
你刚才的行为很高尚
That was a noble thing you did back there.

1227
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:24,360
可惜他不值当
He doesn't deserve it.

1228
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:29,410
我爸肯定不想看到好朋友变成杀人犯
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends to become killers.

1229
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:33,340
再说他死了  就没人知道真相了
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.

1230
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:35,880
不杀他  你就能自由
Alive, you're free.

1231
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,140
把我变成鼻涕虫吧  别给摄魂怪
Turn me into a flobberworm. Anything but the dementors!

1232
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:42,690
罗恩  我是不是个好宠物
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet? You won't let them give me...

1233
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,360
别把我交给摄魂怪  我可是你的宠物
...to the dementors, will you? I was your rat!

1234
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,550
-好姑娘  你也不会  -离她远点
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't-- - Get away from her!

1235
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:53,930
你知不知道  哈利
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1236
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:58,200
你出生时  詹姆和莉莉让我做你的教父
...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.

1237
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:00,340
我知道
I know.

1238
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:05,480
你要还想跟姨妈姨夫住我也理解
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1239
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:08,150
你要是想要个不一样的家
...but if you ever wanted a different home....

1240
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:10,850
跟你一起生活吗
What? Come and live with you?

1241
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:15,280
就是个想法  你不来我也理解
It's just a thought. I can understand if you don't want to.

1242
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:17,220
哈利
Harry!

1243
01:39:32,540 --> 01:39:36,170
莱姆斯  老朋友  你今晚没吃药吗
Remus, my old friend. Have you taken your potion tonight?

1244
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:39,630
你知道你是谁
You know the man you truly are,

1245
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:42,850
莱姆斯  这颗心才是你的  在这
Remus! This heart is where you truly live! This heart here!

1246
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,220
这只是你的肉体
This flesh is only flesh!

1247
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:49,450
除你武器
Expelliarmus!

1248
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,090
哈利
Harry!

1249
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:05,140
莱姆斯
Remus! Remus!

1250
01:40:11,410 --> 01:40:13,710
快跑
Run! Run!

1251
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,750
-快跑  -等等
- Come on. - Wait. Wait.

1252
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:31,020
赫敏  别去  别去
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1253
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:33,430
教授
Professor?

1254
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:39,060
卢平教授
Professor Lupin?

1255
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:50,110
乖狗狗  乖狗狗
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1256
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,080
你在这啊  波特
There you are, Potter!

1257
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:27,880
小天狼星
Sirius!

1258
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,120
给我回来  波特
Come back here, Potter!

1259
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,360
小天狼星
Sirius!

1260
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:42,130
不要  小天狼星
No. Sirius!

1261
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:26,840
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum!

1262
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:40,700
哈利
Harry?

1263
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:45,340
我见到爸爸了
I saw my dad.

1264
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,070
什么
What?

1265
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:48,820
他把摄魂怪赶跑了
He sent the dementors away.

1266
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:50,410
就在湖对面
I saw him across the lake.

1267
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,240
哈利  小天狼星被捕了
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1268
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,320
摄魂怪随时可能给他个吻
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.

1269
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,990
-是杀掉他吗  -不是
- You mean they're gonna kill him? - No. It's worse.

1270
01:45:58,230 --> 01:46:00,020
糟糕的多
Much worse.

1271
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:02,560
是吸出他的灵魂
They're going to suck out his soul.

1272
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:05,600
校长  得阻止他们
Headmaster, you've got to stop them.

1273
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,130
-他们抓错人了  -小天狼星是无辜的
- They've got the wrong man. - It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1274
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:11,500
-都是斑斑干的  -斑斑
- It's Scabbers who did it. - Scabbers?

1275
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:13,070
我的耗子
He's my rat, sir.

1276
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:15,600
其实不是耗子  原来是
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.

1277
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,310
一开始是珀西的
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1278
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:18,830
后来他有了只猫头鹰
But then they gave him an owl.

1279
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,170
重点是  我们知道真相了
The point is, we know the truth.

1280
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:23,850
-请你相信我们  -我是相信的  格兰杰小姐
- Please believe us. - I do, Miss Granger.

1281
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:29,520
但是其他人可就不一定了
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.

1282
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,390
孩子的声音  虽然无比真诚
A child's voice, however honest and true...

1283
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,330
但对不愿倾听的人也没有价值
...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.

1284
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:47,060
时间真是神秘
Mysterious thing, time.

1285
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:49,570
有无穷的力量
Powerful...

1286
01:46:49,810 --> 01:46:52,680
乱加干涉又很危险
...and when meddled with, dangerous.

1287
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:57,880
小天狼星布莱克在天文塔顶端
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.

1288
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,780
规矩你懂  格兰杰小姐
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1289
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,750
不能被看到
You must not be seen.

1290
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,520
我相信你们能圆满完成任务
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.

1291
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:10,220
不然后果非常严重
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.

1292
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,560
如果成功了
If you succeed tonight...

1293
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:15,560
就能拯救不止一条无辜的生命
...more than one innocent life may be spared.

1294
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,630
我觉得拧三下就够了
Three turns should do it, I think.

1295
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,380
对了
Oh, and by the way.

1296
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:28,370
我拿不定主意时
When in doubt, I find

1297
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:32,380
就重走一遍旧路
retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1298
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,610
祝你们好运
Good luck.

1299
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:37,590
他这是发什么神经
What the bloody hell was that all about?

1300
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:40,590
抱歉  罗恩  既然你还不能下床
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk....

1301
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:11,150
怎么回事
What just happened?

1302
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,620
-罗恩呢  -七点半
- Where's Ron? - 7:30.

1303
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:15,660
我们七点半在哪
Where were we at 7:30?

1304
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:17,630
不知道  去找海格了吧
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1305
01:48:17,830 --> 01:48:20,200
走吧  不能被人看见
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1306
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,100
赫敏
Hermione!

1307
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,980
赫敏  赫敏  等等
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1308
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:49,350
赫敏  快告诉我这是干什么
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?

1309
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,400
你个恶心人的小蟑螂
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

1310
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,900
那是我们
That's us.

1311
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:57,040
别  赫敏  对他不值当的
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1312
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:58,700
真是反常
This is not normal.

1313
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,340
这是时间转换器  哈利
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1314
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:05,670
上学期麦格教授给的
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1315
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:09,250
所以我才能同时上几门课
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.

1316
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:12,650
-我们是回到过去了吗  -对
- You mean we've gone back in time? - Yes.

1317
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:16,190
邓布利多让我们回到这时候
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.

1318
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:21,650
肯定是想让我们改变点什么
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.

1319
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:26,130
打得好
Good punch.

1320
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,800
谢谢
Thanks.

1321
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,460
马尔福来了
Malfoy's coming.

1322
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:33,700
-快走  -不许告诉别人  明白吗
- Run. - Not a word to anyone, understood?

1323
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:37,230
那泥巴种真嚣张  我要收拾她  记住了
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.

1324
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:41,380
-感觉挺好  -岂止是好  酷毙了
-That felt good. -Not good, brilliant.

1325
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:45,340
走吧  该去找海格了
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1326
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:07,030
你看  巴克比克还活着
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1327
01:50:08,540 --> 01:50:10,410
对啊
Of course.

1328
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:12,550
邓布利多怎么说的
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1329
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,740
如果成功了  就能拯救不止一条无辜的生命
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.

1330
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:18,480
走吧
Let's go.

1331
01:50:39,810 --> 01:50:41,870
他们来了  快点
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1332
01:50:42,110 --> 01:50:44,540
得先让福吉看到巴克比克
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.

1333
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:47,210
不然就该怀疑海格了
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.

1334
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:50,650
斑斑  你还活着
Scabbers, you're alive!

1335
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:53,580
-看好自己的宠物  -那是小矮星彼得
- Keep a closer eye on your pet. - That's Pettigrew.

1336
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:56,720
-别  哈利  -他背叛了我父母
- Harry, you can't. - He betrayed my parents.

1337
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,890
-我怎么能放过他  -必须放过他
- You don't expect me to sit here. - Yes, and you must!

1338
01:51:03,730 --> 01:51:06,430
哈利  那时候你坐在海格屋里
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1339
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:09,430
如果你冲进去  你就会觉得自己疯了
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.

1340
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:12,470
对时间乱加干涉很危险的
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.

1341
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:14,900
不能被看到
We can't be seen.

1342
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:19,940
福吉来了
Fudge is coming.

1343
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,940
我们怎么还不走
And we aren't leaving?

1344
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:26,680
为什么不走
Why aren't we leaving?

1345
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:39,160
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

1346
01:51:45,210 --> 01:51:46,540
那下真疼
That hurt.

1347
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:48,070
对不起
Sorry.

1348
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:11,560
我们从后门出来了  快走
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1349
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:31,810
-我后面的头发真是那样的吗  -赫敏
- Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?  - Hermione!

1350
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,220
什么
What?

1351
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:37,920
我好像看见了
I thought I just saw....

1352
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,790
-算了  -走吧
- Never mind. - Let's go.

1353
01:52:55,180 --> 01:52:57,440
快走  哈利  快点
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1354
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:05,580
别  让开
Get away. Get off.

1355
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,210
部长  我觉得我也得签字
Minister, I really think I should sign as well.

1356
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:35,210
好吧  是应该
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be....

1357
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,210
巴克比克  过来  跟我们走
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly. Come with us now. Come on.

1358
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,390
快点  快点
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1359
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:52,600
巴克比克  快走啊
Buckbeak. Okay? Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1360
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,700
-签上名字吧  -我名字可长了
- Your name only. - It's such a very long name....

1361
01:53:57,140 --> 01:53:58,800
快点  巴克比克
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1362
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:04,440
过来  巴克比克
Come on. Come on, Buckbeak.

1363
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,940
来吃好吃的雪貂
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1364
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:11,460
这呢  过来  过来
Come on. It's here. Come on,

1365
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:14,080
-比克  -好了  部长  跟我走
- Beaky. -Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1366
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,950
-看那边  -哪边
- Now, look there. - Where?

1367
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:19,520
-岩石那边  -有什么
- Look beyond the rocks. - What am I supposed to see?

1368
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:23,180
迪佩特教授当校长的时候种的石楠
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.

1369
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,200
-是啊  -还有草莓
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed. - And all the strawberries.

1370
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:30,030
-快点  巴克比克  -哪来的草莓
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on. - I see no strawberries.

1371
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,360
-那边  -哪边
- Over there. - Where?

1372
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:33,300
-就在那边  -这边
- Over there. - This way.

1373
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,170
-开始吧  -好吧
- Let's get this over, please. - All right.

1374
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:39,540
哪去了
But where is it?

1375
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:42,710
刚还看见它了
I saw the beast, just now.

1376
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:45,540
-这才几分钟  -真神奇
- Not a moment ago! - How extraordinary.

1377
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,050
巴克比克
Buckbeak.

1378
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:51,350
肯定有人放走了它  邓布利多
Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him.

1379
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,860
-海格  -巴克比克
- Hagrid? - Buckbeak.

1380
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:54,730
我觉得部长
I don't think the minister's

1381
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:57,290
不会怀疑是你的
suggesting you had anything to do with this.

1382
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:00,360
怎么可能呢  你一直跟我们在一起
How could you? You've been with us all the time.

1383
01:55:00,570 --> 01:55:02,400
-也是  -好吧
- Right. - Well, well....

1384
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,040
要地毯式搜查
We must search the grounds.

1385
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:07,230
天上也搜搜吧  部长
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.

1386
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:12,880
我可是要好好喝杯茶  一大杯白兰地也行
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.

1387
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:17,020
行刑手  现在不需要你了
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.

1388
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:19,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

1389
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:22,580
我这可没有小杯  教授
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.

1390
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:34,870
-来吧  -这边
- Come on. - This way.

1391
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:43,440
-这边
This way, now.

1392
01:55:45,950 --> 01:55:47,640
-现在呢  -去救小天狼星
- Now what? - We save Sirius.

1393
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,320
-怎么救  -不知道
- How? - No idea.

1394
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:02,030
-是卢平  -全部定身
- Look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus!

1395
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,400
斯内普来了
And Snape's coming.

1396
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,270
等着吧
And now we wait.

1397
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:21,310
那就等吧
And now we wait.

1398
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:52,170
还是有人挺开心的
At least someone's enjoying himself.

1399
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,740
赫敏
Hermione?

1400
01:56:56,950 --> 01:57:01,250
之前在湖边  我跟小天狼星在一起
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius...

1401
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:03,480
确实还有别人
...I did see someone.

1402
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:07,090
就是他把摄魂怪赶跑了
That someone made the dementors go away.

1403
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:08,590
用他的守护神
With a Patronus.

1404
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,660
我听斯内普告诉邓布利多了
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1405
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,300
他说
According to him...

1406
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:15,870
肯定是个法力很强大的巫师
...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.

1407
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:17,930
是我爸爸
It was my dad.

1408
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:20,840
我爸爸的守护神
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1409
01:57:21,070 --> 01:57:23,270
-但你爸爸已经  -去世了  我知道
- Harry, but your dad's-- - Dead. I know.

1410
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:27,040
但我看到的就是他
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1411
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,810
我们出来了
Here we come.

1412
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:40,860
小天狼星跟我说话呢
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1413
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:43,960
-他要我和他一起生活  -真棒
- He's asking me to come live with him. - That's great.

1414
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:47,360
等他自由了  我就不用回德斯礼家了
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1415
01:57:47,570 --> 01:57:49,160
就我们两个
It'll just be me and him.

1416
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:51,770
没准去乡下
We could live in the country...

1417
01:57:51,970 --> 01:57:54,570
找个能看到天空的地方
...someplace you can see the sky.

1418
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:57,610
关了这么多年  他肯定想看看天空
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.

1419
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,170
哈利
Harry!

1420
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:03,370
快跑
Run!

1421
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,810
走吧
Let's go.

1422
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,740
-你干什么  -救你一命
- What are you doing? - Saving your life.

1423
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:39,380
谢谢
Thanks.

1424
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:43,050
这下好了  他来找我们了
Great. Now he's coming for us.

1425
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:45,250
这倒没想到  快跑
Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1426
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,130
好恐怖
That was so scary.

1427
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:05,240
卢平教授今晚真可怜
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.

1428
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:19,840
小天狼星  快走
Sirius. Come on!

1429
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:37,960
-真可怕  -别担心
- This is horrible. - Don't worry.

1430
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:41,370
我爸会来的  来召唤守护神
My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus.

1431
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,950
马上就到
Any minute now.

1432
02:00:52,190 --> 02:00:54,180
就在那  等着瞧吧
Right there. You'll see.

1433
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,090
听我说  哈利  没人会来的
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming.

1434
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:00,780
别担心  他肯定会来
Don't worry, he will. He will come.

1435
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:07,300
-小天狼星  -你快死了
- Sirius. - You're dying...

1436
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,230
你们两个都是
...both of you.

1437
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:15,030
哈利
Harry!

1438
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:20,840
呼神护卫
Expecto Patronum!

1439
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:21,000
你说对了  赫敏
You were right, Hermione.

1440
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:24,540
之前不是我爸  是我
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was me!

1441
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:27,470
我看到自己召唤守护神
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.

1442
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,010
这回我知道能成功
I knew I could do it this time because...

1443
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,880
因为我已经成功了
...well, I had already done it.

1444
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,520
-说的通吗  -说不通
- Does that make sense? - No.

1445
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:37,520
我不喜欢飞起来
But I don't like flying...!

1446
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:52,000
蹦吧达
Bombarda!

1447
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:28,070
你们两个的恩
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1448
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:29,570
我永生难忘
...to both of you.

1449
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:32,710
-我要跟你走  -等以后吧
- I want to go with you. - One day, perhaps.

1450
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:35,780
最近我的生活肯定很动荡
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.

1451
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:37,710
再说
And besides...

1452
02:03:38,650 --> 02:03:41,920
-你就该在这  -可你是无辜的啊
- ...you're meant to be here. - But you're innocent.

1453
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,210
你知道
And you know it.

1454
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:47,190
这就够了
And for now, that will do.

1455
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:52,050
你估计听的都烦了
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1456
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,590
不过你长得真像你爸爸
...but you look so like your father.

1457
02:03:57,370 --> 02:03:59,300
除了眼睛
Except your eyes.

1458
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,570
-眼睛像  -我妈妈
- You have-- - My mother's eyes.

1459
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:06,270
我跟詹姆和莉莉
It's cruel that I spent so

1460
02:04:06,270 --> 02:04:09,570
在一起那么久  你却没有  是很残忍
much time with James and Lily, and you so little.

1461
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,650
但要记住
But know this:

1462
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:15,950
爱我们的人永远不会离开我们
The ones that love us never really leave us.

1463
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,290
他们就在
And you can always find them...

1464
02:04:21,730 --> 02:04:23,560
这里
...in here.

1465
02:04:33,970 --> 02:04:36,460
你真是最聪明的学生
You really are the brightest witch of your age.

1466
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,900
得走了
We have to go.

1467
02:05:33,230 --> 02:05:35,860
-怎么了  -他自由了  我们成功了
- Well? - He's free. We did it.

1468
02:05:36,070 --> 02:05:37,560
什么成功了
Did what?

1469
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,700
晚安
Good night.

1470
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:49,850
你们怎么回事
How did you get there?

1471
02:05:50,050 --> 02:05:52,680
刚还在那  现在又去那了
I was talking to you there. And now you're there.

1472
02:05:53,050 --> 02:05:55,610
-他说什么呢  哈利  -不知道
- What's he talking about, Harry? - I don't know.

1473
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:59,350
罗恩  没人能同时出现在两个地方的
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?

1474
02:06:25,850 --> 02:06:27,320
好啊  哈利
Hello, Harry.

1475
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,750
地图上看到你了
I saw you coming.

1476
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:40,030
我这个样子还不是最糟的
I've looked worse, believe me.

1477
02:06:42,770 --> 02:06:45,900
-你被开除了吗  -不是
- You've been sacked. - No.

1478
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:49,070
我主动辞职的
No. I resigned, actually.

1479
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,970
为什么辞职
Resigned? Why?

1480
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:56,480
看来有人不小心泄露了我的情况
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.

1481
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,690
明天这时候
This time tomorrow, the owls

1482
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:02,140
会有很多家长来信
will start arriving and parents will not want...

1483
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:05,620
不希望  我这样的人任教
...well, someone like me teaching their children.

1484
02:07:05,890 --> 02:07:07,760
-可邓布利多  -他为我
- But Dumbledore-- - He has already...

1485
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:09,790
冒的险够多了
...risked enough on my behalf.

1486
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,230
再说  我这样的人
Besides, people like me are....

1487
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:17,200
这么说吧  反正我习惯了
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.

1488
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:29,340
你怎么这么悲伤  哈利
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1489
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:31,680
根本没什么改变
None of it made any difference.

1490
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,410
-小矮星逃走了  -怎么没改变
- Pettigrew escaped. - Didn't make any difference?

1491
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:39,060
你可是改变了一切  你发掘了真相
It made all the difference in the world. You uncovered the truth.

1492
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:41,760
拯救了一个无辜的人
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.

1493
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:44,630
这算是天大的改变了
It made a great deal of difference.

1494
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,460
最让我自豪的
If I am proud of anything...

1495
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:54,300
就是这学期你的进步
...it is of how much you have learned this year.

1496
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,200
既然我不是老师了
Now, since I am no longer your teacher...

1497
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,680
地图还给你  我也不用自责了
...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.

1498
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:04,980
该说再见了  哈利
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1499
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,780
我们肯定会再见的
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1500
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:09,650
现在呢
Until then...

1501
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,680
恶作剧完毕
...mischief managed.

1502
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:51,190
退后  不然我就拿到楼上去
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.

1503
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,760
哈利
Harry.

1504
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:55,000
这是哪来的
Wherever did you get it?

1505
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:57,570
我能试试吗  当然是等你试过之后
Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course.

1506
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:59,900
-什么啊  -别说话
- What are you talking about? - Quiet.

1507
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:03,300
让大人物过来  我不是故意打开的  哈利
Let the man through. I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1508
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:05,980
包的不严实  他们逼我的
It was badly wrapped. They made me do it.

1509
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:07,650
哪有
Did not.

1510
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:12,520
-火弩箭  -全世界最快的飞天扫帚
- It's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world.

1511
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:14,240
给我的吗
For me?

1512
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:16,980
-谁送的呢  -谁知道
- But who sent it? - No one knows.

1513
02:09:17,190 --> 02:09:19,060
还带了这个
This came with it.

1514
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:25,560
-上吧  哈利  -开开眼界
- Go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see.

1515
02:09:25,770 --> 02:09:27,560
有多快  哈利
How fast is it, Harry?

1516
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:48,080
荧光闪烁
Lumos.

1517
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:51,150
我庄严宣誓我不怀好意
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

1518
02:21:10,370 --> 02:21:12,130
恶作剧完毕
Mischief managed.

1519
02:21:17,980 --> 02:21:19,380
诺克斯
Nox.
