Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,606
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,445
Marge. How lovely to see--

9
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:49,886
Uncle Vernon,
l need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:51,329
What is it?

11
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:53,531
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:56,255
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:58,531
l will if she does.

14
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:01,687
-Oh, you're still here, are you?
-Yes.

15
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,609
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,652
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:06,815 --> 00:02:10,967
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:15,333
ls that my Dudders?
ls that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:17,213
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,570
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,612
Okay.

22
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,608
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:31,408
-Can l tempt you, Marge?
-Just a small one.

24
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,448
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,926
A bit more.

26
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,606
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 1 2 dogs.

27
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,283
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,166
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,214
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:02:53,655 --> 00:02:55,373
What are you smirking at?

31
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,287
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,646
St. Brutus' . lt's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,693
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,289
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,055
Yeah. l've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,683
Excellent. l won't have this
namby-pamby. . .

37
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,887
. . .wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:20,047
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:23,969
lt's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:26,205
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,253
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:32,134
-And a drunk too, no doubt?
-That's a lie.

43
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,729
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:41,528
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
l have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,447
l think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:46,732
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,933
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:54,730
lt's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:58,774
lf something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:00,567
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,047
Right.

52
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,251
Let me tell you. . . .

53
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,851
Vernon!

54
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,493
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:20,086
Stop!

56
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,009
l've got you, Marge. l've got you.

57
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,212
-Hold on, hold on.
-Get off.

58
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,173
-Don't you dare!
-Sorry.

59
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,087
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,927
Oh, God.

61
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,813
Marge!

62
00:05:46,575 --> 00:05:48,691
Please!

63
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,411
Marge!

64
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,492
Come back!

65
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,804
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,092
-You put her right!
-No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:27,527
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:30,613
-Yeah? Try me.
-They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,049
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,445
l don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,407
''Welcome to the Knight Bus. . .

your conductor for this evening. ''

00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,688
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,485
-l fell over.
-What you fall over for?

76
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,255
-l didn't do it on purpose.
-Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,525
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

-What you looking at?
-Nothing.

Well, come on, then. ln.

80

No, no, no. l'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,891
Come on.

82
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,014
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:20,292
-Take her away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:22,605
lt's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:36,006
-What did you say your name was?
-l didn't.

86
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,488
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:43,493
You hear that? ''The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. ''

88
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,885
The Leaky Cauldron.

-But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
-Muggles?

91
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,367
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,969
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:03,567
Ernie, little old lady at 1 2 o'clock!

Yes!

99

Who is that?

100
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,530
That man.

101
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:34,853
Who is that?

102
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:36,488
Who is--?

103
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:38,970
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:42,652
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,090
He's a murderer.

106
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,769
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,691
-How did he escape?
-Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,732
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,169
He was a big supporter of. . .

. . .You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:02,572
l reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:04,248
Yeah.

113
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:05,689
Him l've heard of.

114
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:10,815
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 1 2 o'clock.

115
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,887
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,805
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,204
Mind your head.

118
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:31,772
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,045
Why the long faces?

120
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,964
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:50,446
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,295
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,769
-Take it away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124

Room 1 1 .

Hedwig.

126
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:30,414
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:34,124
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:39,445
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter. . .

129
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:42,687
. . .earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located. . .

130
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:46,643
. . .a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:50,410
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:55,171
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,846
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:02,483
So that's that. . .

135
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:05,408
. . .and no harm done.

136
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:07,329
Pea soup?

137
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,531
No, thank you.

138
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:11,811
-Minister?
-Yes?

139
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,647
-l don't understand.
-Understand?

140
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,245
l broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:20,333
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban. . .

142
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,929
. . .for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:31,092
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things. . .

144
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:33,610
. . .was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,444
-''The state of things,'' sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,367
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,207
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:48,045
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,247
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,248
These are your new schoolbooks.
l took the liberty. . .

151
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:58,249
. . .of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,129
Hedwig.

153
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:09,165
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't. . .

154
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,810
. . .wander.

155
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:16,088
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,611
Housekeeping.

157
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,045
l'll come back later.

158
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,688
l'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,404
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or l'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,566
lt's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,613
-lt's in his nature.
-A cat? ls that what they told you?

162
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,209
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That's rich. . .

163
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,809
. . .coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,284
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,008
Harry.

166
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,408
Harry.

167
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,493
-Egypt. What's it like?
-Brilliant. Loads of old stuff. . .

168
00:16:12,695 --> 00:16:15,892
. . .like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,132
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:22,332
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-l haven't shown anyone.

171
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:24,804
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,328
-The day maid.
-Night maid.

173
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,531
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,048
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,285
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you.

176
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:33,729
-Got everything?
-Yes.

177
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:35,965
-Yes? All your books?
-lt's all upstairs.

178
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:37,488
-Your clothes?
-Everything.

179
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,008
-Good boy.
-Thank you.

180
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,972
-Harry Potter.
-Mr. Weasley.

181
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:44,491
-Harry, wonder if l might have a word?
-Yeah, sure.

182
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,209
-Hermione.
-Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,845
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. lt should be great.

184
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:57,490
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me. . .

185
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,215
. . .from divulging what l'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,572
But l think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:06,203
You are in danger.

188
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:09,210
Grave danger.

189
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,209
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:15,290
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:19,004
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?

192
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,368
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped. . . .

193
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,287
-Voldemort.
-Don't say his name.

194
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,729
Sorry.

195
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:28,693
When you stopped You-Know-Who. . .

196
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,413
. . .Black lost everything.

197
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:34,693
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,925
And in his mind. . .

199
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,973
. . .you are the only thing
that stands in the way. . .

200
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:43,730
. . .of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,965
And that is why. . .

202
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:48,569
. . .he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,533
To find you.

204
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,493
And kill me.

205
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,975
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear. . .

206
00:17:57,135 --> 00:17:59,569
. . .you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,209
Mr. Weasley. . .

208
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:05,209
. . .why would l go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,533
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:09,567
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,246
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,810
Don't lose him!

213
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,806
l didn't mean to blow her up. l just--

214
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,330
-l lost control.
-Brilliant.

215
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,931
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,767
l was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:27,891
l still think it was brilliant.

218
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,685
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,734
Who do you think that is?

220
00:18:34,895 --> 00:18:37,648
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?

221
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:39,851
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:43,007
-lt's on his suitcase, Ronald.
-Oh.

223
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:46,446
-Do you think he's really asleep?
-Seems to be. Why?

224
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,131
l gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:06,012
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. . .

226
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,927
-. . .to come after you?
-Yeah.

227
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,006
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:12,769
-l mean, everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.

229
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,132
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before. . .

230
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:20,129
-. . .and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
-Thanks, Ron.

231
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,093
Why are we stopping?

232
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:25,767
We can't be there yet.

233
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:31,971
What's going on?

234
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:34,735
l don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,805
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,486
There's something moving out there.

237
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:57,447
l think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:24,368
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,048
Harry.

240
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,847
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,367
Thank you.

242
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:48,850
Here, eat this. lt'll help.

243
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:51,371
lt's all right. lt's chocolate.

244
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:59,406
What was that thing that came?

245
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:02,851
lt was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. lt's gone now.

246
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:05,609
lt was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:09,245
lf you'll excuse me, l need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:16,453
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,289
What happened to me?

250
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,127
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:28,332
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,733
And did either of you two. . .

253
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:33,169
. . .you know. . .

254
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:36,293
-. . .pass out?
-No.

255
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,093
l felt weird, though.

256
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,007
Like l'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:22:41,215 --> 00:22:43,331
But someone was screaming.

258
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,814
A woman.

259
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,646
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:48,010
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,171
Now, l'd like to say a few words. . .

262
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:54,487
. . .before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,772
First, l'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin. . .

264
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,284
. . .who's kindly consented
to fill the post. . .

265
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:02,850
. . .of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:05,449
Good luck, professor.

267
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:13,052
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,775
Potter. ls it true you fainted?

269
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,453
-l mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,526
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it.

271
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:23,970
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher. . .

272
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,972
. . .has decided to retire. . .

273
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:29,730
. . .in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,529
Fortunately,
l'm delighted to announce. . .

275
00:24:32,695 --> 00:24:35,414
. . .that his place will be taken
by none other. . .

276
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:39,727
. . .than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:53,208
Finally, on a more disquieting note. . .

278
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,804
. . .at the request
of the Ministry of Magic. . .

279
00:24:56,015 --> 00:25:00,964
. . .Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban. . .

280
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:04,925
. . .until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,370
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,127
Now whilst l've been assured. . .

283
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:14,810
. . .that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities. . .

284
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,249
. . .a word of caution.

285
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:19,492
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish. . .

286
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:22,931
. . .between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:25:23,095 --> 00:25:26,565
Therefore, l must warn
each and every one of you. . .

288
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:30,205
. . .to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:35,850
lt is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:25:37,895 --> 00:25:41,046
But you know,
happiness can be found. . .

291
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:44,685
. . .even in the darkest of times. . .

292
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:49,564
. . .if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:03,006
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

294
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:08,295
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:11,293
<i>-Fortuna Major.
-No, no. Wait, wait.</i>

296
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,207
Watch this.

297
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:28,290
<i>-Amazing. Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.</i>

298
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:31,885
-Yes, all right. Go in.
-Thank you.

299
00:26:33,815 --> 00:26:35,726
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:37,965
-She can't even sing.
-Exactly.

301
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:41,205
-Hey, man.
-Hey, man.

302
00:26:42,215 --> 00:26:43,534
-Oh, God.
-That's awful.

303
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:46,525
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:50,815
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?

305
00:26:50,975 --> 00:26:53,091
Do not give him one again.

306
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,769
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:04,247
-Ron, catch.
-l will.

308
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,253
l think we have a winner.

309
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:14,405
-Oh, don't try one of them.
-Oh, no.

310
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,404
Look at him. His face.

311
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:01,405
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

312
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:06,484
ln this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:11,729
ln this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:16,883
Hello. l am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:21,492
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:28:21,695 --> 00:28:25,370
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,971
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:30,774
What do you see?

319
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:36,373
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:38,884
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:43,412
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.

322
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,406
-Where did you come from?
-Me?

323
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:48,135
-l've been here all this time.
-You, boy. . . .

324
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,490
ls your grandmother quite well?

325
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,534
l think so.

326
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:55,368
l wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:28:58,255 --> 00:28:59,574
Pity.

328
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:02,289
Broaden your minds.

329
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,932
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:10,926
-l think you are.
-Sure.

331
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:13,251
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,053
Yeah.

333
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:20,087
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:24,005
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:25,489
So. . .

336
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:29,534
. . .you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:31,009
Give me the cup.

338
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:35,292
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,887
My dear. . .

340
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,453
. . .you have the Grim.

341
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:45,927
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:48,848
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:29:49,015 --> 00:29:51,085
''Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,650
lt's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,767
lt's an omen. . .

346
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:57,687
. . .of death. ''

347
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:05,690
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:09,643
Oh, honestly, Ron. lf you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:30:09,815 --> 00:30:13,330
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:16,487
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,247
A fair few.

352
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:20,406
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:23,248
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:25,326
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:30:25,495 --> 00:30:28,726
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:32,968
''Broaden your minds. Use your
lnner Eye to see the future. ''

357
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:37,883
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:30:38,055 --> 00:30:39,807
l got a real treat for you today.

359
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:41,886
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:55,653
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:58,204
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,933
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:03,844
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:16,484
-Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
-l'm okay. Okay.

365
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,087
-l think they're funny.
-Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,650
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:31:25,855 --> 00:31:29,370
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,569
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:47,451
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:58,093
-Just ignore him.
-You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,654
Yeah.

372
00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:12,333
lsn't he beautiful?

373
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,009
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,725
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,891
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:23,411
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:27,324
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:30,134
lt may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:33,526
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:37,966
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:41,974
Come on now.

382
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:43,769
Now. . .

383
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:47,524
. . .you have to let him make the first
move. lt's only polite. So. . .

384
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,492
. . .step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,004
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:54,211
lf he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,447
lf not-- Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:01,971
Just make your bow.

389
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,087
Nice and low.

390
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,807
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,048
Keep still.

392
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:18,566
Keep still.

393
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:30,647
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:35,489
Right. l think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,447
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:47,890
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,448
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,452
Slow down, Harry. That's it. . . .

399
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,692
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,725
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly. . . .

401
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:09,653
That's it. . . .

402
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,529
Yes!

403
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:15,371
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,446
Does he get to fly?

405
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,930
-l think he may let you ride him now.
-What?

406
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,614
-Come on.
-Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,812
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:29,653
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,811
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:11,846
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,374
Oh, please.

412
00:36:14,135 --> 00:36:16,365
Well done, well done.

413
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:20,087
-How am l doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor.

414
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:27,414
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:28,934
Malfoy, no. . . .

416
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,214
No!

417
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,453
Buckbeak!

418
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa. . . .

419
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,533
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,845
Away, you silly creature. . . .

421
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:45,013
-lt's killed me!
-Calm down. lt's just a scratch!

422
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,364
Hagrid!

423
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:51,529
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-l'm the teacher. l'll do it.

424
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,208
-You're gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!

425
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,570
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,051
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,930
lt comes and it goes.
Still, l consider myself lucky.

428
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:31,292
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and l could've lost my arm.

429
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:34,368
-l can't do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.

430
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:38,688
-He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:42,444
l hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,407
-He's been sighted!
-Who?

433
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:46,253
Sirius Black!

434
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:50,133
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,049
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:55,604
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?

437
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,972
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:03,532
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
lt's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:07,332
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,366
lntriguing, isn't it?

441
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:40,134
Would anyone like to venture
a guess. . .

442
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:42,013
. . .as to what is inside?

443
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:46,049
-That's a boggart, that is.
-Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:49,573
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,731
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?

446
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,368
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:38:53,575 --> 00:38:56,647
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:38:56,855 --> 00:39:01,087
-That's what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes. . . .

449
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:06,528
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:11,450
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:14,124
<i>After me. Riddikulus!</i>

452
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:16,371
<i>-Riddikulus!
-Very good.</i>

453
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,964
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:21,291
<i>-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!</i>

455
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,486
-This class is ridiculous.
-Very good.

456
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,529
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:31,284
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:35,727
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:39,854
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:39:40,055 --> 00:39:42,285
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,847
Come on.

462
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:48,651
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,447
Professor Snape.

464
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,407
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.

465
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,851
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:39:56,015 --> 00:40:00,327
-You live with your grandmother.
-l don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,328
No. . .

468
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,808
. . .it won't. l want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:09,127
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,293
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don't need to hear.

471
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:16,164
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when l open that wardrobe. . .

472
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,526
. . .here's what l want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,773
lmagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,613
Can you do that?

475
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:27,769
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,451
One, two, three.

477
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,652
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:40:45,295 --> 00:40:47,251
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

479
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,175
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
lncredible! Okay. . .

480
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,173
. . .to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line. . . .

481
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:04,409
Form a line!

482
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:07,851
l want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most. . .

483
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:11,013
. . .and turn it into something funny.

484
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:12,853
Next! Ron!

485
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:19,325
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:41:30,335 --> 00:41:31,814
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:41:32,535 --> 00:41:34,287
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

488
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:35,729
Yes!

489
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,088
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:45,172
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:49,011
Show us what you see.

492
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:01,171
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,212
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

494
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:06,092
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:08,887
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,371
Here!

497
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,727
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

498
00:42:39,895 --> 00:42:42,693
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:44,766
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:47,449
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:50,527
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:56,846
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,854
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school. . .

504
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:02,813
. . .that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:06,406
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:08,054
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,327
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:13,884
l thought if you signed it,
then l could--

509
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,444
l can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:19,687
Since l am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:43:21,895 --> 00:43:26,286
l'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:30,572
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:45,771
Professor, can l ask you something?

514
00:43:45,975 --> 00:43:49,650
You want to know why l stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,208
l thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,094
l assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:57,611
l did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,329
But then l remembered that night
on the train. . .

519
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:02,929
-. . .and the dementor.
-l'm very impressed.

520
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,848
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,448
This is very wise.

522
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:09,606
Before l fainted. . .

523
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,766
. . .l heard something.

524
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:13,853
A woman. . .

525
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:15,569
. . .screaming.

526
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:18,892
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:44:19,095 --> 00:44:21,893
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:24,811
l think it was my mother. . .

529
00:44:24,975 --> 00:44:27,091
. . .the night she was murdered.

530
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:32,933
The very first time l saw you, Harry,
l recognized you immediately.

531
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:36,214
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:38,685
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:40,974
Yes.

534
00:44:41,295 --> 00:44:44,173
Oh, yes. l knew her.

535
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:50,090
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:53,367
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch. . .

537
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:56,732
. . .she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,173
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others. . .

539
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:06,251
. . .even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:45:07,655 --> 00:45:10,249
And your father, James,
on the other hand. . .

541
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,894
. . .he. . . .

542
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,572
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:23,054
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,728
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:33,527
ln time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:41,053
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:43,689
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:47,734
-You heard it's the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. l know.

549
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:50,488
What's going on?

550
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,010
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:55,484
-Hey.
-Oh, you're there.

552
00:45:55,655 --> 00:45:59,773
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! l'm Head Boy!

553
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:02,927
Get back, all of you.

554
00:46:03,095 --> 00:46:06,132
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:07,569
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,930
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:13,926
lt's not funny, Ron.

558
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:19,768
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:46:25,855 --> 00:46:26,844
-Be quiet.
-Make way.

560
00:46:27,055 --> 00:46:28,932
-The headmaster's here.
-Come on, move.

561
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:30,932
You heard. Move!

562
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:47,328
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:51,568
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,733
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:57,571
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,286
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:47:00,855 --> 00:47:03,415
You listen! l'm Head Boy!

568
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:05,884
-Come back here!
-Keep moving!

569
00:47:09,335 --> 00:47:12,088
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:18,770
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:22,533
lt's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,050
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:27,365
Sirius Black!

574
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:32,490
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:04,125
l've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,763
-Thank you.
-The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,812
-Very good.
-l've done the dungeons.

578
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:11,535
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:14,124
l didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,565
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:48:17,735 --> 00:48:19,930
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own. . .

582
00:48:20,095 --> 00:48:22,655
-. . .completely undetected?
-Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:24,607
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:48:24,815 --> 00:48:27,648
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:29,374
You may recall. . .

586
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:32,254
. . .prior to the start of term
l expressed concerns. . .

587
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:34,406
. . .about your appointment
of Professor--

588
00:48:34,575 --> 00:48:38,488
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,964
l'm quite convinced
the castle is safe. . .

590
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:44,605
. . .and l'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,005
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,729
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:55,091
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:48:55,375 --> 00:49:01,610
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:40,612
Turn to page 394.

596
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:53,091
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:57,051
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:49:57,215 --> 00:50:00,924
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching. . .

599
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:05,970
. . .at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,207
''Werewolves''?

601
00:50:12,535 --> 00:50:15,174
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:18,407
-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet.

603
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,652
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:25,611
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference. . .

605
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,124
. . .between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:30,646
No one?

607
00:50:31,135 --> 00:50:33,933
-How disappointing.
-Please, sir.

608
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:37,172
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:38,814
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:50:39,215 --> 00:50:40,853
With each full moon. . .

611
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:44,724
. . .he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:50:44,935 --> 00:50:48,371
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:52,134
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time. . .

614
00:50:52,295 --> 00:50:54,525
. . .you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:56,606
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself. . .

616
00:50:56,775 --> 00:50:59,972
. . .or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:03,531
-He's got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:08,126
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning. . .

619
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:11,884
. . .two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis. . .

620
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:14,523
-. . .on recognizing it.
-lt's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:18,772
Then l suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:22,854
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:26,650
Page 394.

624
00:51:28,575 --> 00:51:29,974
The term ''werewolf'' . . .

625
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:35,167
<i>. . .is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word '' wer'' . . .</i>

626
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:40,127
. . .which means ''man,'' and ''wolf. ''
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:51:40,775 --> 00:51:43,005
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:46,093
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting. . .

629
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,166
. . .being bitten by a werewolf. . . .

630
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:09,685
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,294
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

632
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,447
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
-Peaky?

633
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:14,810
What do you expect?
He fell over 1 00 feet.

634
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:17,728
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:20,847
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:27,208
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, brilliant.

637
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:29,292
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:32,891
-What happened?
-Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:54:33,175 --> 00:54:35,405
Really? l meant the match. Who won?

640
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,293
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:45,170
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,366
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:51,050
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:57,650
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and. . . .

645
00:54:58,135 --> 00:54:59,568
Well. . . .

646
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:02,970
<i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i>

647
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:05,809
ls there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:07,294
No.

649
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:10,652
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:14,013
-l mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen.

651
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,212
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:55:17,415 --> 00:55:21,488
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory. . .

653
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:26,406
. . .until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,654
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:34,728
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:37,893
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,530
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:55:40,735 --> 00:55:44,614
-l'm scared, professor.
-l'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,131
l need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:55:48,295 --> 00:55:50,206
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,087
There was only one that night.

662
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:56,766
-But you made it go away.
-l don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:55:57,095 --> 00:56:01,850
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you. . .

664
00:56:02,015 --> 00:56:05,530
. . .perhaps l should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,526
For now, l need to rest.

666
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:36,053
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:52,926
-Guys, let me go.
-Clever, Harry.

668
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:55,893
-But not clever enough.
-We've got a better way.

669
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,774
-l'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know.

670
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,084
We'll get you there.

671
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,849
-We'll show you a quicker way.
-lf you pipe down.

672
00:57:03,015 --> 00:57:06,451
-Bless him.
-Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't--

673
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:09,523
-Now, Harry.
-Come and join the big boys.

674
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,931
What are you doing?!

675
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:15,894
-What's this rubbish?
-''What's this rubbish?'' he says.

676
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:19,252
-lt's the secret to our success.
-lt's a wrench giving it to you--

677
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:22,213
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:57:22,375 --> 00:57:24,047
George, if you will.

679
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:27,366
l solemnly swear
that l am up to no good.

680
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:34,291
''Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs. . .

681
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:37,528
. . .are proud to present
the Marauder's Map. ''

682
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,925
We owe them so much.

683
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:47,010
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--

684
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:49,530
-No. ls that really--?
-Dumbledore.

685
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:50,969
-ln his study.
-Pacing.

686
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,012
Does that a lot.

687
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:54,967
-So this map shows--
-Everyone.

688
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:57,086
-Where they are.
-What they're doing.

689
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:58,324
-Every minute.
-Every day.

690
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:01,373
-Brilliant! Where did you get it?
-From Filch's office.

691
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:04,174
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways. . .

692
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:06,895
-. . .out of the castle.
-We'd recommend this one.

693
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:10,092
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:12,007
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
00:58:12,175 --> 00:58:15,451
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:19,767
''Mischief managed. ''
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,771
Now, how much do you want?

698
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:04,606
Delicious.

699
00:59:12,295 --> 00:59:16,208
lt's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did l mention that?

700
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:17,967
Twice.

701
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:20,885
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:22,733
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
00:59:23,015 --> 00:59:25,768
Actually, l'm fine here.

704
00:59:25,935 --> 00:59:27,687
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
00:59:28,055 --> 00:59:30,250
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:34,573
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:37,847
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.

708
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:43,050
Boys, l think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:46,531
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!

710
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:48,606
You filthy little mudblood!

711
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,134
Who is that?

712
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:02,370
-Don't stand there! Do something!
-What?

713
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,570
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,728
Get out of the way!

715
01:00:28,895 --> 01:00:30,453
Move!

716
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:33,773
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,252
Harry!

718
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:43,294
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,532
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:51,011
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:55,043
-Aren't you?
-Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.

722
01:00:55,215 --> 01:00:57,604
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:00:57,815 --> 01:01:00,010
-Ron fancies her.
-That's not true!

724
01:01:00,175 --> 01:01:01,972
-Professor McGonagall!
-Cornelius!

725
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:03,454
Allow me, minister.

726
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:05,407
-Oh, Hagrid. . . .
-Sorry about that.

727
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:08,413
Rosmerta, my dear.
l hope business is good.

728
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:12,324
lt'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors. . .

729
01:01:12,495 --> 01:01:16,374
-. . .into my pub every other night!
-We have. . . .

730
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:19,847
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:22,530
And what would bring him here?

732
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:26,688
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?

733
01:01:26,855 --> 01:01:28,527
Come.

734
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:32,886
Harry!

735
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:44,573
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!

736
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:46,686
-So rude.
-Thick heads.

737
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,448
-Thick heads?!
-How dare they!

738
01:01:48,655 --> 01:01:51,692
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!

739
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:56,169
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:01:56,335 --> 01:02:00,089
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:04,493
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:08,933
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death--

743
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:11,655
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:15,530
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,807
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night. . .

746
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:22,206
. . .he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:24,525
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

748
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:26,845
-Always trailing after Black.
-l remember.

749
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:28,767
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:31,574
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters. . .

751
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:35,728
. . .and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:39,610
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:41,885
He destroyed him!

754
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:47,046
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:02:47,215 --> 01:02:50,127
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters. . .

756
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:53,367
-. . .but he's the reason they're dead.
-He wants to finish things.

757
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:56,294
-l don't believe it.
-That's not the worst of it.

758
01:02:56,495 --> 01:03:00,090
-What could be worse?
-This: Sirius Black was. . .

759
01:03:00,295 --> 01:03:02,331
. . .and remains to this day. . .

760
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:04,333
. . .Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:14,810
Ron, look!

762
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,763
-Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
-Merry Christmas.

763
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:01,407
Harry, what happened?

764
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:05,851
He was their friend. . .

765
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:08,485
. . .and he betrayed them.

766
01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:11,132
He was their friend!

767
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:15,172
l hope he finds me.

768
01:04:15,775 --> 01:04:18,005
Because when he does,
l'm gonna be ready!

769
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,969
When he does, l'm gonna kill him!

770
01:04:34,655 --> 01:04:36,213
<i>Harry.</i>

771
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:38,287
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

772
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,364
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. . .

773
01:04:42,535 --> 01:04:44,890
. . .well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,534
l'm sure.

775
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,450
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:52,926
The spell l'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:54,534
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:04:54,695 --> 01:04:56,287
No? Well. . . .

779
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:59,891
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one. . .

780
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:04,526
. . .it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:05:04,695 --> 01:05:08,370
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:05:08,535 --> 01:05:12,323
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:16,164
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:05:17,335 --> 01:05:19,451
Close your eyes.

785
01:05:21,175 --> 01:05:22,972
Concentrate.

786
01:05:24,175 --> 01:05:26,166
Explore your past.

787
01:05:26,655 --> 01:05:28,452
Do you have a memory?

788
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:32,091
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:34,766
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:05:35,095 --> 01:05:40,215
<i>Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.</i>

791
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:43,334
<i>-Expecto Patronum.
-Very good.</i>

792
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:50,172
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,773
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

794
01:06:10,215 --> 01:06:13,730
<i>Expecto.... Expecto....</i>

795
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:15,613
<i>Expect....</i>

796
01:06:17,535 --> 01:06:21,448
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:25,364
lt's all right. l didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:30,690
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:06:31,495 --> 01:06:34,248
-That's one nasty dementor.
-Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:06:34,455 --> 01:06:37,094
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:06:37,255 --> 01:06:40,292
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,969
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:46,684
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time l rode a broom.

804
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:51,052
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:06:57,655 --> 01:07:02,683
There's another.
lt's not happy, exactly.

806
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:06,571
Well, it is.

807
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,203
lt's the happiest l've ever felt. . .

808
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:13,163
-. . .but it's complicated.
-ls it strong?

809
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,094
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:07:21,815 --> 01:07:23,487
Just do it.

811
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:36,252
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

812
01:07:37,455 --> 01:07:41,243
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

813
01:08:01,975 --> 01:08:03,010
Yes!

814
01:08:04,895 --> 01:08:08,171
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:12,654
-l think l've had enough for today.
-Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:08:12,815 --> 01:08:15,124
Eat this, it helps. lt really helps.

817
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,013
And just so you know, Harry. . .

818
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:21,009
. . .l think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that. . .

819
01:08:21,175 --> 01:08:23,131
. . .is saying something.

820
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,126
l was thinking of him.

821
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:29,365
And Mum.

822
01:08:29,535 --> 01:08:31,685
Seeing their faces.

823
01:08:32,295 --> 01:08:34,889
They were talking to me.

824
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:37,205
Just talking.

825
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,605
That's the memory l chose.

826
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:43,530
l don't even know if it's real.

827
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:46,085
But it's the best l have.

828
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:57,165
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous.

829
01:08:57,335 --> 01:08:59,246
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:01,724
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:04,932
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-l haven't lost anything!

832
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:07,131
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.

833
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:10,492
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers. . .

834
01:09:10,655 --> 01:09:14,409
. . .is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:17,328
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:09:17,495 --> 01:09:19,486
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not.

837
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,088
-Did.
-Didn't.

838
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:25,569
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:09:25,735 --> 01:09:28,886
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns. . .

840
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:31,615
. . .talking about why we were there.

841
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:35,975
l got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak. . .

842
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:38,968
. . .was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,087
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:09:42,255 --> 01:09:45,327
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature. . .

845
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:48,407
. . .who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:50,333
And then?

847
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:53,609
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:57,734
-They're not sacking you!
-No, l'm not sacked.

849
01:09:59,735 --> 01:10:02,613
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:33,688
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:36,329
-l don't wanna tap-dance!
-Tell those spiders.

852
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:40,323
Right, yeah. Tell them. l'll tell them. . . .

853
01:10:57,735 --> 01:10:59,805
<i>-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lumt of a boy.</i>

854
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:02,967
<i>-Always trailing after Sirius Black.
-Black was vicious.</i>

855
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,530
<i>He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</i>

856
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:16,605
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.

857
01:11:58,095 --> 01:12:02,054
-Watch it there, boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:12:09,935 --> 01:12:12,403
<i>Mischief managed. Nox.</i>

859
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:15,809
Potter.

860
01:12:15,975 --> 01:12:19,331
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:12:19,495 --> 01:12:20,610
l was sleepwalking.

862
01:12:20,775 --> 01:12:23,209
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:27,926
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:32,287
My dad didn't strut. And nor do l.

865
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,973
lf you don't mind, l would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:41,206
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:45,328
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:49,692
What's this?

869
01:12:49,854 --> 01:12:52,971
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really? Open it.

870
01:12:59,214 --> 01:13:02,809
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:13:06,454 --> 01:13:07,853
Read it.

872
01:13:10,214 --> 01:13:15,493
''Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs. . .

873
01:13:15,654 --> 01:13:19,613
. . .offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and. . . . ''

874
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,327
Go on.

875
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:26,163
''And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business. ''

876
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:28,808
-You insolent little--
-Professor!

877
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:32,968
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:37,650
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

879
01:13:38,974 --> 01:13:41,283
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:13:41,494 --> 01:13:43,849
That remains to be seen.

881
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:48,249
l have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:13:48,414 --> 01:13:51,804
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:56,570
-Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
-l seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:13:56,734 --> 01:14:00,090
lt looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone. . .

885
01:14:00,254 --> 01:14:03,963
. . .who tries to read it.
l suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:08,207
Nevertheless, l shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:11,366
lt is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:14,731
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:14:20,494 --> 01:14:23,133
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:29,413
Come in.

891
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:36,128
l haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession. . .

892
01:14:36,294 --> 01:14:40,606
. . .but quite frankly, l am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:14:40,774 --> 01:14:44,289
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black. . .

894
01:14:44,454 --> 01:14:46,365
. . .is a map to you?

895
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:49,529
-No.
-No, sir.

896
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:54,366
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:14:54,534 --> 01:14:58,686
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:03,207
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected. . .

899
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:07,652
. . .with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:15:07,854 --> 01:15:09,924
Now, l will not cover up for you again.

901
01:15:10,094 --> 01:15:12,449
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.

902
01:15:12,614 --> 01:15:16,129
l want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:20,845
And don't take any detours.
lf you do, l shall know.

904
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:29,566
Professor, just so you know,
l don't think that map always works.

905
01:15:30,414 --> 01:15:35,169
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone l know to be dead.

906
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,213
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:39,853
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:15:42,374 --> 01:15:44,365
That's not possible.

909
01:15:45,534 --> 01:15:47,126
lt's just what l saw.

910
01:15:49,854 --> 01:15:51,492
Good night, professor.

911
01:15:54,854 --> 01:15:58,847
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:04,213
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.

913
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:07,571
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:10,085
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,450
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:16:16,774 --> 01:16:19,607
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:25,607
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class. . .

918
01:16:25,774 --> 01:16:29,403
. . .l sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit. . .

919
01:16:29,574 --> 01:16:33,328
. . .for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:37,009
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled. . .

921
01:16:37,174 --> 01:16:41,008
. . .as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books. . .

922
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:44,166
. . .to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:16:59,054 --> 01:17:00,965
Have l said something?

924
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:10,244
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental. . .

925
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:12,882
. . .but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:17:13,054 --> 01:17:15,124
Hang on.

927
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:18,087
-We better take this back.
-l'm not going back.

928
01:17:18,414 --> 01:17:21,690
-Fine. See you later.
-See you.

929
01:17:57,894 --> 01:18:02,968
<i>Harry Potter....</i>

930
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:13,647
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight.

931
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,372
Sorry?

932
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:20,011
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder. . .

933
01:18:20,174 --> 01:18:22,130
. . .shall break free.

934
01:18:22,294 --> 01:18:24,444
lnnocent blood shall be spilt. . .

935
01:18:24,614 --> 01:18:30,371
. . .and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:18:36,454 --> 01:18:39,571
l'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:18:40,334 --> 01:18:42,052
No.

938
01:18:42,494 --> 01:18:43,973
Nothing.

939
01:19:34,414 --> 01:19:38,293
l can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. lt's just too horrible.

940
01:19:38,454 --> 01:19:41,093
-lt just got worse.
-What did l say? Father said. . .

941
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:45,247
. . .l can keep the hippogriff's head.
l'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,769
This is going to be rich.

943
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:50,044
-Look who's here.
-Come to see the show?

944
01:19:50,214 --> 01:19:53,206
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:55,046
Hermione, no!

946
01:19:55,614 --> 01:19:57,764
He's not worth it.

947
01:20:11,294 --> 01:20:13,250
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:20:13,454 --> 01:20:17,493
-Let's go. Quick.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:20:17,654 --> 01:20:21,886
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

950
01:20:40,534 --> 01:20:44,652
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:20:44,814 --> 01:20:47,009
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:20:47,174 --> 01:20:49,483
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore. . .

953
01:20:49,654 --> 01:20:52,532
. . .would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:54,969
Says he wants to be with me
when they. . . .

955
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,890
When it happens.

956
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,328
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:21:00,294 --> 01:21:01,773
A great man.

958
01:21:04,134 --> 01:21:07,012
-We'll stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!

959
01:21:07,174 --> 01:21:10,211
Think l want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:13,889
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron. . . .

961
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:23,289
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:21:23,454 --> 01:21:27,003
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-l think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:30,769
Right. Next time l see Crookshanks,
l'll let him know.

964
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:31,969
l meant me!

965
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,770
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:21:40,974 --> 01:21:42,327
Hagrid!

967
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:45,448
Oh, crikey.

968
01:21:46,854 --> 01:21:49,493
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:21:49,694 --> 01:21:53,607
lt's late. lt's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:21:53,774 --> 01:21:57,403
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:21:57,574 --> 01:22:01,010
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:22:02,374 --> 01:22:04,683
Quick. Quick!

973
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:06,526
Hagrid.

974
01:22:06,694 --> 01:22:10,448
-lt'll be fine. lt'll be okay.
-Go on, go on!

975
01:22:12,214 --> 01:22:14,887
-That's ling you see over there--
-On the slope.

976
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:17,614
-On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:20,368
-Good evening.
-Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:22:20,574 --> 01:22:24,249
-Have a tea, if you like.
-No, Hagrid.

979
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:28,722
-Gentlemen.
-l'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:32,131
Well, l think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:22:33,254 --> 01:22:36,690
Very well. lt is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal. . .

982
01:22:36,854 --> 01:22:39,891
. . .of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak. . .

983
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:45,333
. . .hereinafter called ''the condemned,''
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:48,884
-Dear, dear. . . .
-Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:53,292
-All right. lt'll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--

986
01:22:53,454 --> 01:22:55,126
What?

987
01:22:55,294 --> 01:22:57,285
l thought l just saw--

988
01:22:57,454 --> 01:22:59,490
-Never mind.
-Let's go!

989
01:23:04,374 --> 01:23:06,604
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:23:51,214 --> 01:23:52,613
Oh, no.

991
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:05,210
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,651
Ron. Ron!

993
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:11,964
-Ron!
-Scabbers, come back.

994
01:24:13,414 --> 01:24:15,086
Wait!

995
01:24:20,774 --> 01:24:24,892
-Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:24:25,054 --> 01:24:27,249
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:24:30,254 --> 01:24:32,688
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:34,812
lt's the Grim!

999
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:44,446
-Harry!
-Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:24:44,654 --> 01:24:46,565
Harry!

1001
01:24:48,094 --> 01:24:50,369
-Help!
-Ron!

1002
01:24:52,414 --> 01:24:55,531
-Ron. Ron.
-Ron!

1003
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:11,685
Come on!

1004
01:25:13,534 --> 01:25:14,887
Move!

1005
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:20,446
Duck!

1006
01:25:54,854 --> 01:25:57,049
Harry!

1007
01:26:12,294 --> 01:26:15,172
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

1008
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:19,088
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-l have a hunch.

1009
01:26:19,614 --> 01:26:21,047
l just hope l'm wrong.

1010
01:26:39,934 --> 01:26:42,971
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:26:44,014 --> 01:26:45,572
Come on.

1012
01:26:55,494 --> 01:26:56,847
Ron.

1013
01:26:57,374 --> 01:26:59,888
-Ron. You're okay.
-The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:27:00,094 --> 01:27:03,166
lt's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:27:16,494 --> 01:27:19,167
lf you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,052
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:27:21,254 --> 01:27:23,085
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:27:29,054 --> 01:27:31,124
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:34,046
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1020
01:27:37,614 --> 01:27:41,607
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:27:41,814 --> 01:27:44,726
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:27:45,294 --> 01:27:48,764
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:27:58,774 --> 01:27:59,763
-l found him.
-l know.

1024
01:27:59,934 --> 01:28:01,162
-lt's him.
-l understand.

1025
01:28:01,334 --> 01:28:04,406
-Let's kill him!
-No! l trusted you!

1026
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:08,409
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:28:09,094 --> 01:28:12,006
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:28:14,694 --> 01:28:16,332
How long have you known?

1029
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:19,886
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-Well, Hermione.

1030
01:28:20,094 --> 01:28:22,892
You are the brightest witch
of your age l've ever met.

1031
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:25,363
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:28:25,574 --> 01:28:28,088
-Wait!
-l did my waiting!

1033
01:28:28,254 --> 01:28:30,563
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:28:31,174 --> 01:28:33,449
ln Azkaban!

1035
01:28:42,534 --> 01:28:44,206
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:28:44,774 --> 01:28:48,369
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:28:48,534 --> 01:28:50,047
l know why.

1038
01:28:50,254 --> 01:28:52,404
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:28:52,574 --> 01:28:55,372
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:57,365
Somebody did betray your parents. . .

1041
01:28:57,534 --> 01:29:00,890
. . .somebody who, until quite recently,
l believed to be dead!

1042
01:29:01,094 --> 01:29:04,404
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:29:04,574 --> 01:29:07,566
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:10,887
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:13,932
<i>-Come out, come out and play!
-Expelliarmus!</i>

1046
01:29:16,774 --> 01:29:19,163
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:21,484
How l hoped l'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:29:21,654 --> 01:29:22,928
Severus--

1049
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:27,645
l told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:29:27,814 --> 01:29:29,088
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:29:29,254 --> 01:29:33,452
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:36,214
lf you'll excuse us,
Remus and l have business. . .

1053
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:41,164
-. . .to attend to.
-Give me a reason. l beg you!

1054
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,802
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. lt's habit.

1055
01:29:44,014 --> 01:29:45,527
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:48,003
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:50,608
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:29:51,134 --> 01:29:53,523
l could do it, you know.

1059
01:29:53,974 --> 01:29:59,367
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:29:59,534 --> 01:30:02,128
Do l detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:30:02,294 --> 01:30:05,650
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:11,013
lt's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but l'll do my best.

1063
01:30:11,214 --> 01:30:13,364
Severus, please.

1064
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,285
After you.

1065
01:30:20,534 --> 01:30:22,206
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1066

-You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:30,002
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.

1068
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,766
We thought he was our friend!

1069

-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
-No, he didn't.

1070
01:30:34,974 --> 01:30:38,046

Pettigrew on the map!

-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!

Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

01:30:45,374 --> 01:30:49,765
-Me?! He's mental!
-Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:53,046
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?

1075
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,603
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:30:55,774 --> 01:30:58,242
-He's missing a toe, isn't he?
-So what?

1077
01:30:58,414 --> 01:31:01,247
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!

1078
01:31:01,454 --> 01:31:04,571
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:07,646
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.

1080
01:31:10,134 --> 01:31:13,092
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:31:13,254 --> 01:31:14,289
Scabbers!

1082
01:31:14,454 --> 01:31:17,412
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:31:38,974 --> 01:31:40,726
Remus?

1084
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:42,887
Sirius.

1085
01:31:43,054 --> 01:31:44,885
My old friends!

1086
01:31:50,294 --> 01:31:53,969
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,649
-James. We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:31:58,454 --> 01:32:00,968
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:32:01,174 --> 01:32:06,168
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-l didn't mean to!

1090
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:09,053
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:11,768
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:32:12,134 --> 01:32:17,492
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:21,849
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:32:22,054 --> 01:32:27,492
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:32:27,974 --> 01:32:31,967
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:32:32,174 --> 01:32:34,130
No!

1097
01:32:35,574 --> 01:32:39,362
-Harry, this man--
-l know what he is.

1098
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:41,365
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:32:41,534 --> 01:32:46,369
-Bless you, boy. Bless you!
-Get off!

1100
01:32:47,494 --> 01:32:49,769
l said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:32:50,134 --> 01:32:52,250
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:32:56,014 --> 01:32:59,609
Sorry about the bite.
l reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:03,164
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:33:03,334 --> 01:33:04,813
l was going for the rat.

1105
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:08,649
Normally, l have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:33:08,814 --> 01:33:13,842
More than once, James suggested
that l make the change permanent.

1107
01:33:14,014 --> 01:33:18,690
The tail l could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:32,167
Okay.

1109
01:33:36,974 --> 01:33:39,408
-You better go.
-No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:33:39,574 --> 01:33:40,927
lt's fine. l'll stay.

1111
01:33:41,654 --> 01:33:43,565
You go, l'll stay.

1112
01:33:43,854 --> 01:33:46,846
-You okay?
-l'm fine. Go.

1113
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:51,252
-That looks really painful.
-So painful.

1114
01:33:51,414 --> 01:33:53,882
They might chop it.

1115
01:33:54,334 --> 01:33:56,894
l'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:33:57,054 --> 01:34:01,093
lt's too late. lt's ruined.
lt'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:34:02,294 --> 01:34:04,046
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:34:04,854 --> 01:34:08,449
l'll never forget the first time
l walked through those doors.

1119
01:34:09,134 --> 01:34:12,171
lt'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:16,933
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:34:17,694 --> 01:34:19,764
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:34:19,934 --> 01:34:22,971
l didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends. . .

1123
01:34:23,134 --> 01:34:24,613
. . .to become killers.

1124
01:34:24,774 --> 01:34:28,323
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:30,769
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:34:30,934 --> 01:34:33,892
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:34:34,094 --> 01:34:37,291
Ron! Haven't l been a good pet?
You won't let them give me. . .

1128
01:34:37,454 --> 01:34:39,843
. . .to the dementors, will you?
l was your rat!

1129
01:34:40,014 --> 01:34:43,893
-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--
-Get away from her!

1130
01:34:46,254 --> 01:34:48,085
l don't know if you know, Harry. . .

1131
01:34:48,254 --> 01:34:52,167
. . .but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:34:52,334 --> 01:34:54,211
l know.

1133
01:34:55,334 --> 01:34:59,213
l can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle. . .

1134
01:34:59,374 --> 01:35:01,763
. . .but if you ever wanted
a different home. . . .

1135
01:35:01,934 --> 01:35:04,323
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:08,611
lt's just a thought.
l can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:35:08,814 --> 01:35:10,293
Harry!

1138
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:28,609
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:35,014
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:35:36,294 --> 01:35:38,205
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:41,325
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1142
01:35:51,014 --> 01:35:52,493
Harry!

1143
01:35:53,534 --> 01:35:56,367
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:36:02,334 --> 01:36:04,564
Run! Run!

1145
01:36:14,174 --> 01:36:16,130
-Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

1146
01:36:16,294 --> 01:36:21,163
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:36:21,334 --> 01:36:23,484
Professor?

1148
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:28,893
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:39,451
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:36:39,854 --> 01:36:42,288
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:37:14,694 --> 01:37:15,683
Sirius!

1152
01:37:16,494 --> 01:37:18,803
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:38:21,934 --> 01:38:23,287
Sirius!

1154
01:38:24,054 --> 01:38:26,887
No. Sirius!

1155
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:09,807
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1156
01:41:17,174 --> 01:41:19,449
Harry?

1157
01:41:20,334 --> 01:41:22,609
l saw my dad.

1158
01:41:22,814 --> 01:41:24,293
What?

1159
01:41:24,494 --> 01:41:25,973
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:41:26,134 --> 01:41:27,487
l saw him across the lake.

1161
01:41:27,654 --> 01:41:29,246
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:41:29,454 --> 01:41:32,173
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:41:32,334 --> 01:41:34,723
-They're gonna kill him?
-No. lt's worse.

1164
01:41:34,934 --> 01:41:36,686
Much worse.

1165
01:41:36,854 --> 01:41:39,129
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:41:40,774 --> 01:41:42,093
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:41:42,254 --> 01:41:45,485
-They've got the wrong man.
-lt's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:41:45,654 --> 01:41:47,770
-lt's Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?

1169
01:41:47,934 --> 01:41:49,253
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:41:49,654 --> 01:41:53,283
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:41:53,494 --> 01:41:57,009
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:41:57,214 --> 01:41:59,603
-Please believe us.
-l do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:41:59,814 --> 01:42:05,013
But the word of three 1 3-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:42:07,974 --> 01:42:10,647
A child's voice,
however honest and true. . .

1175
01:42:10,814 --> 01:42:14,409
. . .is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:42:19,414 --> 01:42:21,848
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:42:22,974 --> 01:42:24,248
Powerful. . .

1178
01:42:24,414 --> 01:42:27,167
. . .and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:42:28,694 --> 01:42:32,164
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:42:32,934 --> 01:42:34,970
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:42:35,134 --> 01:42:36,852
You must not be seen.

1182
01:42:37,014 --> 01:42:40,529
And you would do well, l feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:42:40,694 --> 01:42:44,084
lf not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:42:44,614 --> 01:42:46,332
lf you succeed tonight. . .

1185
01:42:46,494 --> 01:42:49,213
. . .more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:42:50,974 --> 01:42:53,090
Three turns should do it, l think.

1187
01:42:57,774 --> 01:42:59,526
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:42:59,694 --> 01:43:05,291
When in doubt, l find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:43:05,454 --> 01:43:07,445
Good luck.

1190
01:43:07,934 --> 01:43:10,289
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:13,164
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk. . . .

1192
01:43:40,974 --> 01:43:42,532
What just happened?

1193
01:43:42,694 --> 01:43:44,889
-Where's Ron?
-7:30.

1194
01:43:45,054 --> 01:43:46,851
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:43:47,014 --> 01:43:48,732
l don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:43:48,894 --> 01:43:51,169
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:43:52,214 --> 01:43:53,966
Hermione!

1198
01:44:11,414 --> 01:44:13,974
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:44:15,694 --> 01:44:19,130
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:44:19,334 --> 01:44:22,053
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:23,488
That's us.

1202
01:44:23,694 --> 01:44:26,492
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:44:26,694 --> 01:44:28,093
This is not normal.

1204
01:44:30,294 --> 01:44:32,569
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:44:32,734 --> 01:44:34,850
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:44:35,014 --> 01:44:38,211
This is how l've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:44:38,414 --> 01:44:41,486
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.

1208
01:44:41,654 --> 01:44:44,885
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:44:47,094 --> 01:44:50,131
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:44:53,134 --> 01:44:54,408
Good punch.

1211
01:44:54,574 --> 01:44:56,007
Thanks.

1212
01:44:56,974 --> 01:44:58,566
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:44:59,454 --> 01:45:01,684
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:45:02,134 --> 01:45:05,092
l'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:45:05,254 --> 01:45:09,008
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:45:10,334 --> 01:45:12,802
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:45:31,174 --> 01:45:33,608
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:45:35,014 --> 01:45:36,811
Of course.

1219
01:45:36,974 --> 01:45:38,885
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:45:39,054 --> 01:45:42,933
lf we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:45:43,294 --> 01:45:44,568
Let's go.

1222
01:46:04,974 --> 01:46:07,010
Here they come. l'd better hurry.

1223
01:46:07,174 --> 01:46:09,563
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:46:09,734 --> 01:46:12,089
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:46:13,094 --> 01:46:15,369
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:46:15,534 --> 01:46:18,207
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:21,212
-Harry, you can't.
-He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:46:21,374 --> 01:46:24,252
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!

1229
01:46:27,974 --> 01:46:30,568
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:46:30,734 --> 01:46:33,453
lf you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:46:33,614 --> 01:46:36,367
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:46:36,534 --> 01:46:38,684
We can't be seen.

1233
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:43,492
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:46:44,374 --> 01:46:46,365
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:46:48,454 --> 01:46:49,967
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:47:00,454 --> 01:47:01,933
Are you mad?

1237
01:47:07,694 --> 01:47:09,013
That hurt.

1238
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:10,488
Sorry.

1239
01:47:30,494 --> 01:47:33,054
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:47:49,734 --> 01:47:52,453
ls that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:47:54,414 --> 01:47:55,688
What?

1242
01:47:56,534 --> 01:47:58,286
l thought l just saw. . . .

1243
01:47:58,494 --> 01:48:01,054
-Never mind.
-Let's go.

1244
01:48:14,774 --> 01:48:16,969
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:48:22,974 --> 01:48:24,851
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:48:46,134 --> 01:48:49,410
Minister, l really think
l should sign as well.

1247
01:48:50,214 --> 01:48:53,251
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be. . . .

1248
01:48:53,454 --> 01:48:57,083
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:49:01,374 --> 01:49:03,968
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:49:06,254 --> 01:49:09,883
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:49:10,694 --> 01:49:13,845
-Your name only.
-lt's such a very long name. . . .

1252
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:15,852
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:49:18,454 --> 01:49:21,287
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:49:21,494 --> 01:49:23,689
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:49:26,214 --> 01:49:30,526
-Come on. lt's here. Come on, Beaky.
-Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:49:30,734 --> 01:49:32,326
-Now, look there.
-Where?

1257
01:49:32,534 --> 01:49:35,765
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am l supposed to see?

1258
01:49:35,934 --> 01:49:39,290
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:49:39,454 --> 01:49:42,173
-Oh, yes. lndeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries.

1260
01:49:43,094 --> 01:49:45,847
-Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
-l see no strawberries.

1261
01:49:46,014 --> 01:49:47,129
-Over there.
-Where?

1262
01:49:47,294 --> 01:49:48,966
-Over there.
-This way.

1263
01:49:49,174 --> 01:49:51,734
-Let's get this over, please.
-All right.

1264
01:49:53,334 --> 01:49:54,972
But where is it?

1265
01:49:55,854 --> 01:49:57,970
l saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:49:58,574 --> 01:50:00,690
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary.

1267
01:50:00,854 --> 01:50:02,128
Buckbeak.

1268
01:50:02,334 --> 01:50:06,247
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:50:06,414 --> 01:50:07,688
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.

1270
01:50:07,894 --> 01:50:11,967
l don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:50:12,174 --> 01:50:14,893
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:50:15,054 --> 01:50:16,851
-Right.
-Well, well.

1273
01:50:17,014 --> 01:50:18,493
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:21,566
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:50:21,734 --> 01:50:26,933
Meanwhile, l'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:50:27,094 --> 01:50:30,928
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:50:31,094 --> 01:50:32,891
Thank you.

1278
01:50:33,094 --> 01:50:36,245
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:50:46,574 --> 01:50:48,007
-Come on.
-This way.

1280
01:50:54,534 --> 01:50:56,252
This way, now.

1281
01:50:58,574 --> 01:51:00,246
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.

1282
01:51:00,454 --> 01:51:02,843
-How?
-No idea.

1283
01:51:11,774 --> 01:51:14,049
<i>-Look. lt's Lupin.
-Immobulus!</i>

1284
01:51:20,214 --> 01:51:22,125
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:51:28,094 --> 01:51:29,686
And now we wait.

1286
01:51:30,854 --> 01:51:32,572
And now we wait.

1287
01:51:59,014 --> 01:52:02,131
-At least someone's enjoying himself.
-Yeah.

1288
01:52:04,814 --> 01:52:06,532
-Hermione?
-Yeah?

1289
01:52:06,694 --> 01:52:10,846
Before, down by the lake,
when l was with Sirius. . .

1290
01:52:11,014 --> 01:52:13,050
. . .l did see someone.

1291
01:52:13,214 --> 01:52:16,490
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:52:16,654 --> 01:52:17,928
With a Patronus.

1293
01:52:18,094 --> 01:52:19,925
l heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:52:20,094 --> 01:52:21,493
According to him. . .

1295
01:52:21,654 --> 01:52:24,930
. . .only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:52:25,094 --> 01:52:26,891
lt was my dad.

1297
01:52:27,974 --> 01:52:29,692
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:52:29,854 --> 01:52:32,004
-Harry, but your dad's--
-Dead. l know.

1299
01:52:33,374 --> 01:52:35,604
l'm just telling you what l saw.

1300
01:52:39,574 --> 01:52:41,132
Here we come.

1301
01:52:46,574 --> 01:52:48,849
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:52:49,014 --> 01:52:51,733
-He's asking me to come live with him.
-That's great.

1303
01:52:51,894 --> 01:52:55,091
When we free him, l'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys' .

1304
01:52:55,254 --> 01:52:56,812
lt'll just be me and him.

1305
01:52:57,454 --> 01:52:59,331
We could live in the country. . .

1306
01:52:59,494 --> 01:53:02,008
. . .someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:53:02,174 --> 01:53:04,893
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:53:05,894 --> 01:53:07,373
Harry!

1309
01:53:08,854 --> 01:53:10,492
Run!

1310
01:53:17,094 --> 01:53:18,573
Let's go.

1311
01:53:37,334 --> 01:53:39,564
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.

1312
01:53:43,654 --> 01:53:44,973
Thanks.

1313
01:53:46,734 --> 01:53:50,613
-Great. Now he's coming for us.
-Yeah, l didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:55:02,654 --> 01:55:04,326
That was so scary.

1315
01:55:04,494 --> 01:55:07,327
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
01:55:18,294 --> 01:55:21,286
Sirius. Come on!

1317
01:55:36,654 --> 01:55:38,690
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.

1318
01:55:38,854 --> 01:55:41,926
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
01:55:50,294 --> 01:55:52,046
Any minute now.

1320
01:55:52,254 --> 01:55:54,210
Right there. You'll see.

1321
01:55:55,534 --> 01:55:57,923
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
01:55:58,094 --> 01:56:00,528
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
01:56:04,494 --> 01:56:06,849
-Sirius.
-You're dying. . .

1324
01:56:08,814 --> 01:56:10,611
. . .both of you.

1325
01:56:12,614 --> 01:56:14,252
Harry!

1326
01:56:16,094 --> 01:56:19,803
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1327
01:57:16,014 --> 01:57:17,527
You were right, Hermione.

1328
01:57:17,694 --> 01:57:20,891
lt wasn't my dad l saw earlier.
lt was me!

1329
01:57:21,054 --> 01:57:23,693
l saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
01:57:23,854 --> 01:57:26,129
l knew l could do it
this time because. . .

1331
01:57:26,294 --> 01:57:27,932
. . .well, l had already done it.

1332
01:57:28,094 --> 01:57:30,449
-Does that make sense?
-No.

1333
01:57:30,614 --> 01:57:33,333
But l don't like flying. . . !

1334
01:57:45,934 --> 01:57:47,208
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1335
01:58:19,174 --> 01:58:21,847
l'll be forever grateful for this. . .

1336
01:58:22,014 --> 01:58:23,288
. . .to both of you.

1337
01:58:23,454 --> 01:58:26,252
-l want to go with you.
-One day, perhaps.

1338
01:58:26,414 --> 01:58:29,212
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
01:58:29,374 --> 01:58:31,046
And besides. . .

1340
01:58:31,934 --> 01:58:35,085
-. . .you're meant to be here.
-But you're innocent.

1341
01:58:35,254 --> 01:58:37,290
And you know it.

1342
01:58:38,334 --> 01:58:40,131
And for now, that will do.

1343
01:58:42,374 --> 01:58:44,808
l expect you're tired of hearing this. . .

1344
01:58:45,774 --> 01:58:48,208
. . .but you look so like your father.

1345
01:58:49,894 --> 01:58:51,771
Except your eyes.

1346
01:58:52,694 --> 01:58:54,889
-You have--
-My mother's eyes.

1347
01:58:56,774 --> 01:59:01,643
lt's cruel that l spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
01:59:02,214 --> 01:59:03,647
But know this:

1349
01:59:04,734 --> 01:59:07,771
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
01:59:09,094 --> 01:59:10,971
And you can always find them. . .

1351
01:59:13,254 --> 01:59:15,051
. . .in here.

1352
01:59:25,014 --> 01:59:27,448
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
01:59:53,174 --> 01:59:54,732
We have to go.

1354
02:00:21,854 --> 02:00:24,414
-Well?
-He's free. We did it.

1355
02:00:24,574 --> 02:00:26,053
Did what?

1356
02:00:26,214 --> 02:00:28,091
Good night.

1357
02:00:36,494 --> 02:00:37,768
How did you get there?

1358
02:00:37,934 --> 02:00:40,494
l was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:00:40,814 --> 02:00:43,328
-What's he talking about, Harry?
-l don't know.

1360
02:00:43,494 --> 02:00:46,884
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:01:12,294 --> 02:01:13,727
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:01:17,214 --> 02:01:18,966
l saw you coming.

1363
02:01:23,334 --> 02:01:25,928
l've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:01:28,534 --> 02:01:31,571
-You've been sacked.
-No.

1365
02:01:31,734 --> 02:01:34,567
No. l resigned, actually.

1366
02:01:34,734 --> 02:01:36,452
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:01:36,614 --> 02:01:41,688
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:01:41,854 --> 02:01:47,133
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want. . .

1369
02:01:47,294 --> 02:01:50,525
. . .well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:01:50,734 --> 02:01:52,565
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already. . .

1371
02:01:52,734 --> 02:01:54,531
. . .risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:01:54,694 --> 02:01:57,811
Besides, people like me are. . . .

1373
02:01:58,414 --> 02:02:01,611
Well, let's just say
that l'm used to it by now.

1374
02:02:10,774 --> 02:02:13,242
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:02:13,414 --> 02:02:15,484
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:02:15,654 --> 02:02:19,044
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:02:19,214 --> 02:02:22,570
lt made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:02:22,734 --> 02:02:25,123
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:02:25,494 --> 02:02:27,883
lt made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:02:32,334 --> 02:02:34,450
lf l am proud of anything. . .

1381
02:02:34,614 --> 02:02:37,174
. . .it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:02:37,334 --> 02:02:39,973
Now, since l am no longer
your teacher. . .

1383
02:02:40,134 --> 02:02:44,207
. . .l feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:02:45,094 --> 02:02:47,483
So now l'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:02:47,654 --> 02:02:50,122
l feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:02:50,654 --> 02:02:51,928
Until then. . .

1387
02:02:53,214 --> 02:02:54,852
. . .mischief managed.

1388
02:03:27,694 --> 02:03:31,733
Stand back, l said! Or l'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:03:31,894 --> 02:03:33,247
Harry.

1390
02:03:34,054 --> 02:03:35,373
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:03:35,534 --> 02:03:37,843
Can l have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:03:38,014 --> 02:03:40,084
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet.

1393
02:03:40,254 --> 02:03:43,405
Let the man through.
l didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:03:43,574 --> 02:03:45,963
lt was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:03:46,134 --> 02:03:47,567
Did not.

1396
02:03:48,894 --> 02:03:52,250
-lt's a Firebolt.
-lt's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:03:52,414 --> 02:03:53,893
For me?

1398
02:03:54,054 --> 02:03:56,488
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.

1399
02:03:56,654 --> 02:03:58,485
This came with it.

1400
02:04:03,134 --> 02:04:04,726
-Go on, Harry!
-Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:04:04,894 --> 02:04:06,646
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:04:25,214 --> 02:04:26,772
Lumos.

1403
02:04:26,934 --> 02:04:29,243
<i>I solemnly swear that I am
ut to no good.</i>

1404
02:15:20,614 --> 02:15:22,332
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1405
02:15:27,854 --> 02:15:29,253
<i>Nox.</i>
