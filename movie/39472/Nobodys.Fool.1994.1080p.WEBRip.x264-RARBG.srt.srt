1
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,940
Mom, what are you doing?

2
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,710
You're going to catch your death.

3
00:02:19,783 --> 00:02:21,182
Come on inside.

4
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,675
Mr. Sullivan?

5
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,483
Mr. Sullivan!

6
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:58,579
God just took out Mrs. Gruper's birdbath.

7
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,492
He's getting closer, Clive.

8
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:08,828
Last year, it was streetlight at the end of the block.

9
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,867
Now it's Mrs. Gruper's birdbath.

10
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,460
I think God's zeroing in on me.

11
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:17,098
I have the feeling this is the year he lowers the boom.

12
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,573
Still alive in there, old lady?

13
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,371
Didn't die in your sleep, did you?

14
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,911
Not yet.

15
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,109
Well, you're talking to yourself,

16
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,673
so it can't be too long.

17
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:30,584
As a matter of fact, I wasn't talking to myself.

18
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,188
I was talking to Clive Sr.

19
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:33,515
Good. For a while there,

20
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:35,422
I thought you were going batty on me.

21
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,050
Can I interest you in a cup of tea?

22
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,116
No.

23
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,526
Not now, not ever.

24
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,121
Why are you wearing a necktie?

25
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,495
You're not in trouble

26
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,033
with the police again, are you?

27
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,692
Not unless you blew the whistle on all my parking tickets.

28
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:46,735
I should.

29
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:48,169
There's probably a reward.

30
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,402
Before they do throw you in the hoosegow,

31
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,602
would you mind fixing the porch railing?

32
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:56,475
It's been broken for a month.

33
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:57,536
Sure thing, old girl.

34
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,582
Just don't forget.

35
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,910
Do I ever?

36
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,518
Yes.

37
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,816
Well, I won't this time.

38
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,855
So, what's The Bank been up to lately?

39
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:08,187
I wish you wouldn't call him that.

40
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,825
Is Clive Jr. Springing for Thanksgiving dinner?

41
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,520
Yes. As a matter of fact,

42
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:14,996
my son is taking me to the country club.

43
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,123
Uh-huh.

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,134
We wear the chains we forge in life.

45
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:19,169
I don't suppose

46
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:21,704
you remember who said that.

47
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:22,704
You did, Miss Beryl.

48
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:24,434
All through eighth grade.

49
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:28,610
Hey, dummy.

50
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,408
Don't you have enough sense to come inside

51
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,539
where it's warm?

52
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,105
You know what I always wish?

53
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:36,448
I wish I had me enough money for a warm coat.

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,181
You know what else I wish?

55
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,120
No, what else do you wish?

56
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,489
I wish we'd go back to working together like we used to.

57
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,529
I hear Carl Roebuck has this big Victorian...

58
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:47,723
Oh, no.

59
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:48,799
Well, he's redoing it.

60
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,800
Nah, forget it.

61
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,461
Six months work, all indoors.

62
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:53,628
Told you I'm not working for him again.

63
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,001
Besides, my lawyer says when I get out of court today,

64
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,165
I'm going to be a rich man.

65
00:04:59,076 --> 00:04:59,974
Uh...

66
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,739
in that case, can I borrow ten dollars?

67
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:05,975
Rub...

68
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,144
there are women in this town that I could hang out with

69
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,050
that would be cheaper than you.

70
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,850
Yeah, but they wouldn't be your friend.

71
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:24,400
Well, here we are again, Mr. Wirfley.

72
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:25,526
The question is, why?

73
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:29,561
Your Honor, we would like to document for the court

74
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:34,042
the deterioration of my client's knee,

75
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:36,545
resulting from an injury he sustained

76
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,810
while in the employ of the Tip Top Construction Company.

77
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:45,014
I have here countless documents from reputable doctors

78
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:46,852
who have...

79
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:49,119
who have...

80
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:50,217
I had them here someplace, uh...

81
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:51,758
- Mr. Wirfley... - With your patience...

82
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:52,887
Uh, Mr. Wirfley...

83
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:53,987
Your Honor?

84
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:56,055
You have failed on numerous occasions to demonstrate

85
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:58,363
that the injury in question was a result of negligence

86
00:05:58,435 --> 00:05:59,561
on the part of the employer.

87
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:01,866
The court finds for the Tip Top Construction Company

88
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:02,997
and against Mr. Sullivan.

89
00:06:03,073 --> 00:06:05,940
Sully... Sully?

90
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,711
I should've known better than to hire a one-legged lawyer.

91
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:12,646
Well, you can't afford a two-legged lawyer.

92
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:14,547
Don't get discouraged, okay?

93
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:17,644
It's a temporary setback... that's all.

94
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:19,450
You've got to remember our strategy.

95
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:23,482
Strategy? That's the first I ever heard of any strategy.

96
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,926
Sooner or later, we'll wear the bastards down.

97
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,691
The court is already starting

98
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:28,663
to get pissed.

99
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:29,926
You heard the judge.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,558
He's pissed at you, Wirf.

101
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,967
Only because he knows I won't go away.

102
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:36,096
I know how he feels.

103
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:04,860
He called in sick,

104
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,527
he's on the phone, he's in the Bahamas...

105
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:08,935
Take your pick... he doesn't want to see you.

106
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,966
The Bahamas sound swell.

107
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,442
Ruby, grab his checkbook.

108
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,443
We'll take off.

109
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,570
There's about 1,000 other guys

110
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:18,478
I would take with me before you.

111
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,607
Thanks, honey.

112
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:25,183
I heard the judge threw you and that two-bit lawsuit

113
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,552
out of court.

114
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:28,818
Hope you didn't have to pay him more than you owed me.

115
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,824
Aw, Sully, don't be bitter.

116
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:30,825
America's a great place.

117
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:32,020
Where else could a cripple

118
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,859
and a drunk, one-legged lawyer even get to talk to a judge?

119
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,696
Good news is I got a job even you can't screw up.

120
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,065
I told you I'm not working for you

121
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,433
till you pay me what you owe me.

122
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,506
Forget about it. You were working off the books, okay?

123
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,235
You don't hire anybody unless they work off the books.

124
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:44,940
And you won't work

125
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,771
except off the books, Sully.

126
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,641
Think you got a right to steal from anybody

127
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:49,939
that's got a couple bucks in their pocket?

128
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,776
Huh? I'm supposed to assume

129
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,579
the position just 'cause you got a bum knee and no prospects?

130
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,642
Bullshit.

131
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:58,118
Besides, you did shoddy work, okay.

132
00:07:58,222 --> 00:07:59,883
- You think I got where I got... - What?

133
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:00,981
...by doing shoddy work?

134
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,855
No.

135
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,185
You didn't get where you are by doing shoddy work.

136
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,762
You didn't get where you are by doing any work.

137
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:11,960
You got where you are because your daddy gave it to you,

138
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,026
and he drove himself into an early grave so you could

139
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,095
piss it away on ski trips and sports cars.

140
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:18,403
I haven't been skiing in two years, Sully.

141
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,908
Hey, look, personally, I don't give a goddamn whether

142
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,773
you go broke, which you probably will, but before you do,

143
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:22,937
you're going to pay me what you owe me.

144
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:24,105
I'm not going to pay you.

145
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,442
I don't owe you a goddamn cent.

146
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,573
I'm going to come through that goddamn door,

147
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,082
I'm going to grab you

148
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,139
by your pin head,

149
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,186
and I'm going to throw you out the window.

150
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,683
Five... four...

151
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,750
three... two... one.

152
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:41,858
What kind of work?

153
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,721
Ooh...

154
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,523
Oh.

155
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,999
Shit.

156
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,550
Dad?

157
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,720
Peter?

158
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,789
You need a lift?

159
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,568
All right.

160
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,547
Well, been a while.

161
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,616
Three years.

162
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,516
Weren't you supposed to be working at teaching...

163
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:09,142
what's that school?

164
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,016
University of West Virginia.

165
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,613
Oh, yeah.

166
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,248
What brings you guys this far north?

167
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,587
Vera.

168
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,253
Welcome to the Thanksgiving from hell.

169
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,524
Goddamn it, Charlotte,

170
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,930
if we're going to start the weekend like this...

171
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,595
Oh, Vera... how is she, anyway?

172
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,602
I don't think I've seen her

173
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:28,695
since the last time you guys were up here.

174
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:29,830
Well, now,

175
00:10:29,906 --> 00:10:31,237
how can you live in a town this size

176
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,935
and not see your ex-wife all the time?

177
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,136
That's easy, darling.

178
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:37,840
Peter's mom and I don't exactly travel in the same circles.

179
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,882
As a matter of fact,

180
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,042
Vera pretty much travels in a straight line.

181
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,087
Somebody in this family had to.

182
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,883
Who are you?

183
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:46,854
He's your grandfather.

184
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,756
Does he always look like that?

185
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,918
Yeah, most of the time.

186
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,689
How come they call you Wacker?

187
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:55,990
Wacker!

188
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:57,124
I didn't do anything.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,825
You okay?

190
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,697
He hit him.

191
00:10:58,835 --> 00:10:59,824
- Stop the car. - You what?

192
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:00,835
I did not.

193
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:01,996
- What happened? - Did so.

194
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,266
Stop before I throw that little

195
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,667
son of a bitch out.

196
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:08,267
Sweetie...

197
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:10,002
Go get your dad and see if he's okay.

198
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,479
Would somebody tell me what's going on?

199
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,913
What do you think, Peter?

200
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:13,950
Go get your dad.

201
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:14,949
All right, all right.

202
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,115
I'm going, okay.

203
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,118
Why are you always hitting?

204
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:20,281
What the hell happened, Dad?

205
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:21,786
What's the matter?

206
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,018
Jesus Christ.

207
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:27,654
Wacker did that?

208
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,857
Oh, don't be a jerk.

209
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,895
I fell off a scaffold about six months ago.

210
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,562
Have you seen a doctor?

211
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:35,627
Yeah, saw about 20 of them.

212
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:36,672
What'd they say?

213
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,799
About 20 different things.

214
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:42,905
Well, thanks for the lift.

215
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,071
Look, get back in the car.

216
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:45,910
I-I'll take you wherever you want to go.

217
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:48,678
Oh, no.

218
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,185
See you around.

219
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:53,051
You sure you're okay?

220
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,557
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

221
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,785
Don't worry about it.

222
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,190
Hey, listen...

223
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:02,027
why don't you stop by Mom's tomorrow?

224
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,535
Huh? Better ask Vera about that.

225
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,967
I don't have to ask permission

226
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:09,232
to invite my own father to Thanksgiving dinner.

227
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,274
I'll think about it.

228
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,082
Hey.

229
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,956
Yeah?

230
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:33,655
You ain't naked or anything, are you?

231
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,324
No, but I can be in about two seconds.

232
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:38,158
Eh, take your time.

233
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,829
I need a cup of coffee.

234
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,874
East Towing? Sullivan.

235
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,311
Yeah, uh, I'm just around the corner:

236
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,006
313 Harmon.

237
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,274
Pick me up.

238
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,184
Hey... charge it.

239
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,720
Tip Top Construction Company.

240
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,721
Bye.

241
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,849
Horace?

242
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:06,122
Hi, Sully. I ain't naked either.

243
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:07,788
Oh, thank God for that.

244
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,065
Lord, how does a man get that dirty?

245
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:13,830
Working for your husband.

246
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:17,931
I thought you were never going to work for Carl again.

247
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,771
Aw, it's just temporary.

248
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,037
Here's your keys.

249
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,272
I wish I hadn't of let you talk me into doing this.

250
00:13:23,346 --> 00:13:26,543
Oh, well. I'd cash it as quickly as possible.

251
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:27,810
Thanks, Mr. Yancy.

252
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:29,249
Hey, while you got your checkbook out,

253
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,048
why don't you pay me what your husband owes me?

254
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,554
Dummy and I ironed the whole thing out

255
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,180
down at the office, but all he had

256
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:36,589
was a company checkbook, see? So he, um...

257
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,991
Nice try, Sully.

258
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:39,289
He does owe me.

259
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:40,989
Well, get in line.

260
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:42,725
He owes everybody.

261
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,030
You take a big pile of money, and you go have a heart bypass...

262
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,764
see how much money you have left after that.

263
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,599
What's going on?

264
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,168
Changed the locks, and throwing out his clothes.

265
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:59,477
As far as I'm concerned, he no longer lives here.

266
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:02,040
It's a bold move.

267
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:03,949
Won't work.

268
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,487
It might get his attention.

269
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:08,991
Well, maybe it will, and maybe it won't.

270
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,050
You know... when my trifecta comes in,

271
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,958
why don't you dump what's-his-name

272
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,587
and run away with me?

273
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,659
Where would we go?

274
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:22,262
Hawaii. Someplace where it's warm.

275
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,273
You know, where they got umbrellas in the drinks.

276
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:28,277
Where they rub you with coconut oil.

277
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,288
Got to go.

278
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:44,750
Hang in there.

279
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:46,693
Hang in there?

280
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:49,061
That's it? That's the sum of your wisdom on the subject?

281
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,600
It's the sum of my wisdom on most subjects.

282
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:13,790
Hey, there you are.

283
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,792
Where the hell have you been?

284
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,226
I've been looking everywhere for you.

285
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,525
Well, you should have given up.

286
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:21,655
Aces over.

287
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,959
Three tens.

288
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,033
Phooey!

289
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:27,330
Deal me in.

290
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:32,967
I sure do like a woman whose love ain't for sale.

291
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,839
Screw you, Sully.

292
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,572
Got to go tinkle.

293
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,079
Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,046
Ruby?

295
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,810
What now?

296
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:42,943
Don't take your love to town.

297
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,284
Ruby...

298
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,722
Don't take your love to town.

299
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,554
For God's sakes, turn around.

300
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,254
Have a little respect, fellas.

301
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:54,558
Look, I know

302
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:56,366
we didn't do so good today, but, uh...

303
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,856
there's a zillion things we can try.

304
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,336
Nope.

305
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:01,702
When was the last time you won a case, Wirf?

306
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:03,864
What's that got to do with anything?

307
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,998
Cut.

308
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:06,599
Gray river

309
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,234
around a green monkey's ass.

310
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:11,007
You know, Sully, you're the only guy I know

311
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,515
still dumb enough to believe in luck.

312
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,144
I used to believe in brains and hard work till I met you.

313
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,949
Deal.

314
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:20,887
Seven card.

315
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,822
Which one of your fancy doctors advised you

316
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,792
to drink, smoke and screw your brains out?

317
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,590
Those are unreasonable requests, Sully.

318
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,927
They wouldn't have made them if they didn't know me.

319
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:31,023
If they had known you, they wouldn't have fixed you.

320
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,035
King bets.

321
00:16:33,103 --> 00:16:34,627
Last call.

322
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:38,997
You want to Sheetrock one of them houses for me

323
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,167
over on Nelson tomorrow?

324
00:16:40,243 --> 00:16:41,335
Hey, I thought you said

325
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:43,671
you were never going to work for Carl again.

326
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,145
Shut up, Rub.

327
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:47,183
Sheetrock is a two-man job.

328
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,218
What about it, rubber head?

329
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,082
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

330
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:53,156
I won't work on Thanksgiving.

331
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:53,986
Sure, you will.

332
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:55,581
Hmm...

333
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:56,625
Double time.

334
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:57,853
In your dreams.

335
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,622
Oh, Sheetrock the son of a bitch yourself.

336
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,186
Why should I pay you double time, Sully?

337
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,288
Hey, what's tomorrow, Rub?

338
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:04,591
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

339
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,167
Know what burns my ass, Sully?

340
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:08,568
You wouldn't even know it was Thanksgiving

341
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:09,696
if it wasn't for Rub.

342
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:12,274
Know enough to know that it's double time. Five.

343
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:14,572
Know what Thanksgiving is?

344
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:16,009
Down and dirty.

345
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,946
Thanksgiving is a time for normal people, Sully,

346
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:22,178
to do normal things... to be in the bosom

347
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:23,583
of their family.

348
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:26,315
And that, my friend, is not you.

349
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,653
It's still going to be double time.

350
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:29,817
Yeah. Sheetrock

351
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,622
the son of a bitch yourself.

352
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:33,628
Bet's to you, Jocko.

353
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:35,288
Ten.

354
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:36,627
Well, I'm out.

355
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:41,700
What's wrong with you?

356
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,706
I'm trying to communicate with you telepathically.

357
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,071
Forget about it.

358
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:48,633
Only way to communicate with Sully

359
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:51,145
is to whack him in the head with a shovel.

360
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:52,738
It's your bet, genius.

361
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,181
15.

362
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,774
Call.

363
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:58,945
Call.

364
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,885
Eights full.

365
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,892
All the nines.

366
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,591
Jesus H. Christ.

367
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:12,726
I was trying to tell you to fold.

368
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:15,100
Cash me in, Jocko. You know, Rub,

369
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:16,763
I think your supervisor here

370
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,865
is in for a little rude awakening.

371
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:21,001
Tomorrow morning, about 7:00 a.m.,

372
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:22,669
he's going to be out there

373
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,940
shoveling old Miss Beryl's driveway,

374
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,312
ten below, fingers freezing.

375
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:29,851
Then, all of a sudden, it's going to occur to him,

376
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,011
Hey, I could be indoors

377
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,816
working where it's nice and warm...

378
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,288
working with my old buddy Rub.

379
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:36,621
I know what I'll do... call my good friend,

380
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:38,752
Honest Carl Roebuck... take him up on that

381
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,557
Sheetrocking job he offered me...

382
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,963
maybe earn back some of my money I lost playing cards.

383
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,796
But you know what?

384
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:47,700
By tomorrow...

385
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:50,169
it's going to be too fucking late.

386
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:53,165
Think about it, schmucko.

387
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:22,599
That you, Sully?

388
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:24,037
Yeah.

389
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:26,837
Did you come to steal our new snowblower?

390
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:30,977
I've done it already, just about.

391
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,880
I could legally shoot you, and get away with it.

392
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,851
Not unless I'm breaking and entering.

393
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,117
Are you going to break and enter?

394
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:44,249
So, what's happening with Dummy?

395
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:45,794
I don't know.

396
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:47,261
He took my threat to shoot him

397
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,298
a lot more seriously than you just did.

398
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:50,730
The poor guy

399
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,027
just had a bypass.

400
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:53,625
Maybe he's trying

401
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,967
to cram everything he can do into six months.

402
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,735
When he realizes he's going to live until he's 70,

403
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,139
he'll slow down.

404
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,336
If I had my way, he wouldn't live till Thanksgiving.

405
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:03,879
Go ahead... steal our snowblower.

406
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:07,405
You're the slowest goddamn thief I ever saw.

407
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,172
Sully, give me a light.

408
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,730
Huh?

409
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:08,208
Give me a light.

410
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,311
Go home, you jerk.

411
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:16,182
You're married to the best- looking woman in Bath.

412
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,779
Who was it said, A man's reach should exceed his grasp?

413
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,653
And tell her you love her, huh?

414
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,055
Or else I will.

415
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:25,060
God, Sully...

416
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:28,188
I sure hope I don't end up like you.

417
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:29,788
I hope you don't either.

418
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,096
60 years old, and still getting crushes

419
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:33,362
on other men's wives.

420
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,734
I would hope, by the time I'm your age,

421
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,238
I'm a little smarter than that.

422
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:38,898
Can't hurt to hope.

423
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:41,034
You sure are off to a slow start.

424
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:51,345
You know, I got one just like that.

425
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:58,293
Identical.

426
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,140
Does this mean

427
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,073
you're finally going to get around

428
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:15,633
to fixing my porch railing?

429
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,741
I'll do it today, I promise.

430
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:24,348
Do you mind my asking what you are doing?

431
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,786
I'm keeping the guy that I stole this from

432
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,084
from stealing it back.

433
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,920
Donald,

434
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:31,254
does it ever bother you

435
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:34,728
that you haven't done more with the life God gave you?

436
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:37,391
Not often.

437
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,833
Now and then.

438
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,170
And it's not just the theme park...

439
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,074
it's all the businesses that go along with it.

440
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,077
How are you?

441
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,374
Hotels, restaurants, gas stations.

442
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,438
- Happy Thanksgiving. - Do you people have any idea

443
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:56,178
what property values are going to go to around here?

444
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,386
Why, just this morning,

445
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:00,219
Mr. Lomax and I were talking on the phone, and he said...

446
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:01,381
Well, C.W., do you mind

447
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,357
telling these people what you told me?

448
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,223
The fact is, Clive Jr., we're talking

449
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:07,387
about an initial investment of 100 million.

450
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:08,691
Oh, Joe.

451
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,858
That's just for starters.

452
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,329
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:14,767
I think they want us to go up.

454
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,134
Mother?

455
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:17,365
Oh, yes, I will say

456
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,432
that I certainly have appreciated your hospitality.

457
00:23:20,676 --> 00:23:24,009
Clive has been just wonderful through all of this.

458
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,810
I couldn't have done any of it without him.

459
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,909
You must be very proud of your son.

460
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,045
Actually, he's not really my son.

461
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,646
They switched bassinets in the hospital.

462
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:37,055
It's a long story, Clive.

463
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:41,227
She's just kidding.

464
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:44,824
So now, the Dolphins will set up to kick.

465
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:46,265
Dallas, back deep to return

466
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,098
for the Cowboys... Williams and...

467
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,366
Want some help?

468
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,337
No.

469
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:55,767
Mom...

470
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,904
uh...

471
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,814
Charlotte wants us to leave in the morning.

472
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,078
It's just it's...

473
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:05,120
We're not doing too well.

474
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:09,090
Being here makes it worse.

475
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:11,988
You know who I blame for this?

476
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:13,392
Donald Sullivan.

477
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,690
Mom...

478
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,766
There was a show on Oprah the other day

479
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,735
about men who can't face responsibility.

480
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:23,203
About how they had destroyed their children's lives.

481
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:27,936
I promise you, it fit Donald Sullivan to a T.

482
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,444
There's one thing Oprah understands.

483
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,772
It's men.

484
00:24:31,848 --> 00:24:33,816
What's that truck doing out there?

485
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:42,957
Dad!

486
00:24:45,695 --> 00:24:47,185
Hey, how are you?

487
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:48,355
I'm sorry I'm late.

488
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:50,399
I just got here.

489
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,425
Shit.

490
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,766
Ten. He's going to dive to the goal.

491
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,806
Touchdown... Miami!

492
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:02,640
Sully, is that you?

493
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,009
Hey.

494
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,741
What a surprise.

495
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,909
Vera will be tickled pink to see you.

496
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,782
Your mother doesn't know I'm coming?

497
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:12,787
I didn't think you'd really show up.

498
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:15,258
Vera, guess who's here.

499
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:16,782
I'll be right there.

500
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:19,360
What's taking you so long?

501
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,089
I have to pee.

502
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:24,232
Out of the way, doofus.

503
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,824
Wacker!

504
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:30,804
Wacker, I'm warning you.

505
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:34,365
Uh... listen, uh... I forgot something in the garage.

506
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:36,172
Yeah. I... I'd better check on Charlotte.

507
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:38,679
The snap is high, the kick is up, it's good!

508
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:42,180
I really mean it this time, Wacker.

509
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:47,153
Sully.

510
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,120
Happy Thanksgiving.

511
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,718
Mommy!

512
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:58,726
Wacker, no. Um... Wacker... no, uh...!

513
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:01,727
Hey, come out of there now, Will.

514
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:02,963
What are you doing here?

515
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,199
Open the door right now!

516
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,331
- I mean it. - What's the matter, sweetie?

517
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:07,308
What happened? Oh, what did you do to him?

518
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,367
What did I do to him? What did he do to me?

519
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,436
What did he do to my mother's china?

520
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:12,841
Charlotte, for God's sake!

521
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,075
Don't For God's sake,

522
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,447
Charlotte me! What did you do to him?

523
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:16,447
I beg your pardon.

524
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:18,176
This is all your fault.

525
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:20,415
All right, Will,

526
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,650
I'm going to count to ten.

527
00:26:25,962 --> 00:26:27,657
...three...

528
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,735
What's the matter now, Raymer?

529
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:08,736
Broken tail light. This is the third time.

530
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:11,637
One more time, Sully, and I'm impounding this heap of yours.

531
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:13,072
Jesus Christ.

532
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:14,632
Raymer, it's Thanksgiving.

533
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,678
Yeah, well, if you'd fixed it

534
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:16,906
the first time, this wouldn't happen.

535
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:24,179
That's $15.

536
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:26,221
You can mail it in or you can come by the station.

537
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:29,348
If it's not paid within 30 days, you'll be held in contempt.

538
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:31,927
Boy, I hope you get laid sometime soon.

539
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:35,055
You know, someday, smartass, I'm going to nail you...

540
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,395
when you least expect it.

541
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:02,654
You okay?

542
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,385
Uh...

543
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:07,895
Will.

544
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:09,089
Yeah, Will.

545
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,325
Is he dead?

546
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,423
Who?

547
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,468
Wacker.

548
00:28:13,702 --> 00:28:16,432
No, but he's pretty bent out of shape.

549
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:18,973
You better come and sit up front with me.

550
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,101
Come on. There you go. Yeah.

551
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,792
Hello.

552
00:28:38,861 --> 00:28:40,761
Missing anybody?

553
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,321
Oh, thank God. Where are you?

554
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,923
Cozy Corner.

555
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,365
Okay, I'll be right there.

556
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,105
Thank you.

557
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,847
You and Wacker fight all the time?

558
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,082
Sometimes.

559
00:29:07,156 --> 00:29:09,681
At least you got even. That's something.

560
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,726
When Mom and Dad get divorced...

561
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:12,988
Divorced?

562
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:14,689
When Mom and Dad get divorced,

563
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,697
I'm going to go and live with my dad,

564
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:19,859
and Wacker will go and live with Mom.

565
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,062
She'll find out how really bad Wacker is.

566
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:23,867
Yeah?

567
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:26,430
And when Mom and Dad get back together,

568
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:28,477
everything will be different.

569
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,680
We'll live in a house instead of an apartment,

570
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:35,273
and I'll have my own room,

571
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:38,252
and Wacker won't be able to play with my toys

572
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,880
unless I say so.

573
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,018
And Mom and Dad won't argue anymore,

574
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:49,258
or fight about money or anything.

575
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,802
Hey, pal.

576
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,244
Hi, Dad.

577
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,111
Thanks for calling.

578
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,015
The, uh... situation

579
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:12,383
at the house has just gone ballistic.

580
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:14,115
What's with you and Charlotte?

581
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,421
Sometimes I think you did the smart thing...

582
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:19,427
just running away.

583
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,225
I only got about five blocks.

584
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,425
Well, you might as well have gone to the moon.

585
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,436
You trying to get me to say I'm sorry?

586
00:30:28,504 --> 00:30:30,768
No. I know better than that.

587
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,069
Come on, pal.

588
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:34,939
Let's go.

589
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,871
Tell me something.

590
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,884
Do you ever even think about me?

591
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:47,013
I guess, sometimes. Yeah.

592
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:49,956
Well, I thought about you all the time.

593
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:18,541
Hiya!

594
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,182
Hi.

595
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,116
Come on in, Sully.

596
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:24,846
Come on. Take a load off.

597
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:27,945
This is men's night at Casa Roebuck.

598
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:30,753
We're drinking from the bottle.

599
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:37,264
Where's Dummy?

600
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,164
Where's Ruby?

601
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:45,063
Why does he do it?

602
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,836
Well, he's not in love with her, if that's what you mean.

603
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:50,879
Hey, I don't know the reason

604
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,504
why I do half the things that I do,

605
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:54,173
let alone your dimwit husband.

606
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:56,149
Well, did you ever get so mad

607
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,243
that you wanted to shoot somebody?

608
00:32:58,354 --> 00:33:01,448
That's why I don't carry a gun.

609
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:03,184
Well, maybe we should go out

610
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:06,227
and buy a couple of.357 Magnums and rob banks...

611
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:07,819
like Bonnie and Clyde.

612
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:10,387
Just you and me.

613
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:13,560
Well, you'd have to be Clyde.

614
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:15,235
I'm too tired.

615
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:18,062
You always cheer me up.

616
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,166
I think it's because you're the only person I know

617
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:22,801
who's worse off than me.

618
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:28,316
Nah. It's because... deep down, secretly...

619
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:30,511
you're in love with me.

620
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,781
Really?

621
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,788
You betcha.

622
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:42,089
I guess we'll never know.

623
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,928
Not at the rate we're going.

624
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,867
Well, if you're not in love with me, I'm going home.

625
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:52,937
Oh, where did numbnuts hide the snowblower?

626
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,203
Over at the Tip Top.

627
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:58,269
Huh. I'll steal it back again tomorrow...

628
00:33:58,347 --> 00:34:00,008
or the next day.

629
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,447
Watch out

630
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,109
for that mean-ass dog.

631
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,550
Not worried about the dog.

632
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:07,517
I'm worried about whether I can get over that fence

633
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,250
with one leg.

634
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:14,387
Oh, you're a man among men, Sully.

635
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:16,090
Well, thanks.

636
00:34:16,165 --> 00:34:19,191
That wasn't a compliment.

637
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:38,319
I know you don't like the idea,

638
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,548
but you should sell this place

639
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:41,850
and let me invest the money

640
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:43,323
in real estate out by the theme park.

641
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:46,088
There's big money headed this way.

642
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,526
Serious money.

643
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,427
This could be the new Gold Coast.

644
00:34:49,498 --> 00:34:50,897
You're right...

645
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,228
I don't like the idea.

646
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,269
Besides, I can't sell this place.

647
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,338
I have a tenant.

648
00:34:56,338 --> 00:34:58,966
That's another thing.

649
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,009
Sully has to go.

650
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:02,236
I was up there last night.

651
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:04,336
You should see that place for yourself...

652
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:05,778
countless cigarette burns.

653
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:08,009
This house could go up in flames any minute.

654
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,414
Clive, you know Mr. Sullivan

655
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,248
does not like you snooping around.

656
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,981
I wasn't snooping around.

657
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,353
I was just looking after my mother's interest,

658
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:17,221
which is more than she'll do for herself.

659
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:18,520
I mean, keeping this house is

660
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:22,155
lunatic enough without having a pyromaniac for a tenant.

661
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:26,133
Why is it that everyone in town can see through him except you?

662
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:29,170
Oh, dear God in heaven.

663
00:35:29,238 --> 00:35:31,968
Mr. Sullivan! Mr. Sullivan!

664
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,871
Mother, what is it?

665
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:35,874
Mother, what is it?

666
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:37,172
What's the matter?

667
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:38,873
Mr. Sullivan, come quickly!

668
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:41,313
It's Miss Hattie!

669
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,442
Mother, I'll take care of it.

670
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,508
Thank heavens

671
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:46,053
you're still here.

672
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:47,884
Hattie's escaped again.

673
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:49,924
Stay put. I'll get her.

674
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,391
Hurry. She's in the middle of the street.

675
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:54,190
Hurry is not what I do best.

676
00:35:54,263 --> 00:35:55,924
I'm looking for my muffler.

677
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:57,363
Is that The Bank?

678
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,400
Tell him he's in trouble.

679
00:35:59,468 --> 00:35:59,991
Hurry.

680
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,000
I am hurrying.

681
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:02,229
It just looks like slow motion.

682
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:11,136
No driving on the sidewalk.

683
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,556
Hi, good-looking.

684
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:26,321
You running away from home?

685
00:36:27,362 --> 00:36:29,296
Where you headed?

686
00:36:29,364 --> 00:36:31,298
To my sister's in Albany.

687
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:33,493
Ah. Let me give you a lift.

688
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,299
I think you'll get there quicker.

689
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:38,066
Okay.

690
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:43,170
Listen, what say you and me go dancing some night?

691
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:44,610
Dancing?

692
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:46,336
Yeah. Just you and me.

693
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,882
Hey, Sully.

694
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:55,446
Hi, Jake.

695
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:56,491
How you doing, Sully?

696
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,423
There you go, safe and sound.

697
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:00,085
Oh, God.

698
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:01,186
Oh, Ma.

699
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:04,323
What gets into you?

700
00:37:04,399 --> 00:37:05,388
Thanks, Sully.

701
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:08,303
Yeah.

702
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,304
Just take care of things, okay,

703
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:10,362
while I look after Mom.

704
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:11,838
Well, Rufus,

705
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,932
I guess it's just you and me.

706
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,841
Here... these go to Jocko. He takes ketchup.

707
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,435
I don't get time for a cup of coffee?

708
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:24,378
Sully.

709
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:28,412
Give these to Jocko in the second booth.

710
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,548
I want to talk to you.

711
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,592
Hey.

712
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,991
I could've...

713
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,364
Takes ketchup.

714
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,399
I could've handled that business.

715
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:44,404
I didn't need

716
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,462
your interference.

717
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,474
How was your Thanksgiving, Clive?

718
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,907
You have a nice day?

719
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,379
What'd you do?

720
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:52,176
Uh... nothing, nothing much.

721
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,613
I, uh... just had dinner with my mother.

722
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,215
Nothing much, huh?

723
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:57,512
I thought maybe you were someplace

724
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:58,746
you shouldn't have been.

725
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,490
We've been through this before.

726
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,754
A landlord has...

727
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,817
You are not my landlord.

728
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:08,827
My mother is your...

729
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,124
Is the only reason I don't kick your ass.

730
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,428
You don't get out of here right now,

731
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:13,525
I may change my mind.

732
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,869
Hey, the ketchup stays here.

733
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:33,411
Judge Wapner's verdict is coming right up.

734
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:38,154
First of all, I'm certainly sorry that the bird died...

735
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:39,853
there's no question about that.

736
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:43,091
We... sympathy is with you, but we don't decide cases

737
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,928
on the basis of sympathy.

738
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,195
Hey, Birdy, you got any aspirin?

739
00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:48,361
Is it your knee?

740
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:50,302
Yeah, thought it was getting better.

741
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,307
Uh... that accident caused the trauma to the knee.

742
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:54,500
That's arthritis.

743
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:56,203
Arthritis doesn't get better.

744
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,439
Gets worse.

745
00:38:58,513 --> 00:39:00,811
Here...

746
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,281
Eat these... You'll feel better.

747
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:05,380
Thanks.

748
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:07,285
Didn't know pharmacists made house calls.

749
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:08,322
How much do I owe you?

750
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,322
Nada. They're samples.

751
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,484
Well, if you're really getting a guarantee,

752
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,118
then it should be in writing.

753
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:15,390
Okay, shyster, who do you like?

754
00:39:15,464 --> 00:39:16,488
The plaintiff.

755
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:17,862
It's a lock.

756
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:19,423
I'll take your defendant.

757
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:22,129
You weren't even here for the stories.

758
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:24,138
Yeah, but I know my lawyer.

759
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:25,298
Turn it up.

760
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:28,069
...he'd either have to be foolhardy

761
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:32,307
or stupid to say, I'm going to guarantee you a healthy bird.

762
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,871
Judgment is for the defendant.

763
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:39,886
You know, you're my only consistent source of income.

764
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:44,358
I don't know why I even come in here.

765
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,018
To be among friends?

766
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,254
That must be it.

767
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,423
All you people ought to treat me better.

768
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:55,469
When I'm gone, you'll discover how hard it is

769
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:58,973
to find a one-legged lawyer who's always in a good mood.

770
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,944
Well...

771
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,981
Vaya con huevos, amigos.

772
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:14,545
Go with eggs?

773
00:40:29,337 --> 00:40:30,463
Peter!

774
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,006
Oh, hi.

775
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:35,270
What's going on?

776
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:36,611
I don't know.

777
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:38,340
Where do you want to start?

778
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:42,008
Wife and I had a major shoot-out last night.

779
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:44,176
She left... took Wacker with her.

780
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:45,276
So where's Will?

781
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:48,584
He's staying with me.

782
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,525
Anyway, I ought to be going.

783
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,322
Hey, you busy right now?

784
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:53,952
Me?

785
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:56,327
Uh... well...

786
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,389
fact of the matter is, Mom has a headache,

787
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,661
and I promised her I'd get her some aspirin.

788
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:03,268
Just the guy I'm looking for. Come on.

789
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:04,327
Yeah, but I...

790
00:41:04,406 --> 00:41:05,873
Come on.

791
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,431
Haven't got all night.

792
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:11,535
You want some buns?

793
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:13,240
Dogs don't eat buns.

794
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:15,317
Buying ground beef for your dog?

795
00:41:15,317 --> 00:41:17,285
I don't have a dog.

796
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,034
Don't seem to care about that too much.

797
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,566
Anyway...

798
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,302
You know, she's been threatening to leave for months.

799
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,570
Thing is...

800
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:45,909
I never should've made her come up for Thanksgiving,

801
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,347
'cause Mom is the one person in this world

802
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,043
she dislikes more than me.

803
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,580
Jesus Christ, man!

804
00:41:52,654 --> 00:41:54,178
Yeah, that's okay.

805
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,622
Here, hold this.

806
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,919
God.

807
00:42:00,128 --> 00:42:02,028
What's that?

808
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:05,064
One...

809
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,191
What's going on?

810
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:08,967
Two...

811
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:10,231
Think it's enough?

812
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:11,329
What are you doing, Dad?

813
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,067
I think you're right.

814
00:42:13,141 --> 00:42:14,165
I think we need one more.

815
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:15,208
Dad.

816
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:16,209
Oh, yeah.

817
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:18,541
Hey, Bowzer.

818
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:20,638
Look at that.

819
00:42:20,715 --> 00:42:21,977
Come on.

820
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,641
Room service.

821
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:25,549
Yeah... yeah, yeah. Come on.

822
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,145
There you go.

823
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,485
Oh, God.

824
00:42:29,557 --> 00:42:31,616
I don't believe this.

825
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:33,490
I'm a member of Greenpeace,

826
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:35,552
and I just helped poison a dog.

827
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,427
Well, for one thing, it ain't poison.

828
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,160
For another, you didn't help much.

829
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:40,199
That part comes later.

830
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:41,200
You had any supper?

831
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:42,395
No.

832
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,404
Well, come on. I'll buy you a hamburger.

833
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:50,137
Hey, if it's not too much trouble,

834
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:52,577
would you mind telling me what the hell is going on?

835
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:53,943
Uh, later, maybe.

836
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:12,627
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

837
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,100
Don't worry about it.

838
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:22,236
Uh... I don't know.

839
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,244
He could be waiting to pounce.

840
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,371
Nah, he's all pounced out.

841
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:29,542
Well, maybe it's a trick.

842
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:32,142
Ain't the smartest dog in the world, you know.

843
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,448
Yeah, just the meanest.

844
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:34,545
Watch.

845
00:43:40,261 --> 00:43:41,387
See?

846
00:43:44,432 --> 00:43:46,400
Looks like a good place. Come on.

847
00:43:46,468 --> 00:43:51,235
Tell me again this is your own snowblower we're stealing.

848
00:43:51,306 --> 00:43:53,672
I knew your mother was gonna raise you like this. Get going.

849
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,937
Well, what if somebody comes by and sees me up...

850
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:57,239
Hey, hey, hey, climb, will you?

851
00:43:57,312 --> 00:43:58,336
I'm not getting any younger.

852
00:43:58,413 --> 00:43:59,380
All right.

853
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:09,547
Don't get stuck.

854
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:11,683
Don't get stuck? That's it?

855
00:44:11,926 --> 00:44:14,895
My father walks out on his family when I'm a year old

856
00:44:14,963 --> 00:44:16,590
and all my life I've been waiting

857
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:18,996
for him to show up and act like a father.

858
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,400
So here I am, finally with my dad, together at last...

859
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:24,939
Quality time... right?

860
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:26,270
And what are we doing?

861
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:28,138
Breaking and entering.

862
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:29,574
And what are his words of wisdom?

863
00:44:29,644 --> 00:44:32,442
Don't get stuck.

864
00:44:36,084 --> 00:44:37,016
Ooh.

865
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:38,017
You okay?

866
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:39,144
Yeah.

867
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,017
All right, here.

868
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:42,613
Watch it.

869
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:47,051
Try not to cut your arm off.

870
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:56,937
Dad?

871
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:00,873
Don't move.

872
00:45:19,461 --> 00:45:21,088
You were right.

873
00:45:21,162 --> 00:45:22,356
That third pill was the winner.

874
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:28,259
Wow. I mean, wow, that was...

875
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:31,271
You know, when I... when I saw that dog, I thought...

876
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:36,502
I've never done anything like that before.

877
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,710
You know what Mom's worst fear is?

878
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:44,146
That your life has been fun.

879
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,017
Tell her not to worry.

880
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:50,319
I want to show you something.

881
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:53,588
Hey, we're not going to break into this place, too, are we?

882
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:56,687
Nah... I got the key to this one.

883
00:45:56,764 --> 00:45:59,392
Or I used to.

884
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,627
You own this place?

885
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:03,500
City probably owns most of it now in back taxes.

886
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,334
I grew up here.

887
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:08,239
It was my father's house.

888
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:11,676
As far as I'm concerned, it can rot.

889
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:15,246
He was some piece of work... your grandfather.

890
00:46:15,316 --> 00:46:16,374
That good, huh?

891
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:18,419
Yeah, he was... he was good,

892
00:46:18,486 --> 00:46:20,454
when he was sober, but then,

893
00:46:20,522 --> 00:46:22,581
I don't think anybody ever saw him sober.

894
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:27,557
Your grandmother took the worst of it.

895
00:46:27,629 --> 00:46:31,030
She was just a...

896
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:33,431
tiny, little woman, and...

897
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:38,165
my God, he could make her fly.

898
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,436
One minute, she'd be standing... over there,

899
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:43,943
and the next minute, she'd be...

900
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,478
...on the opposite side of the room,

901
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,485
just sitting on the floor.

902
00:46:51,553 --> 00:46:54,750
I made the mistake once of trying to get in between them.

903
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:58,425
I don't know... I was 12 or something, and... and, um...

904
00:46:58,493 --> 00:46:59,551
he didn't much care for that.

905
00:46:59,627 --> 00:47:01,151
He...

906
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:04,960
I had thought he was going to kill me.

907
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,399
Jesus Christ.

908
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:12,068
Well, anyway, fuck him eternally.

909
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,172
I suppose you're going to be saying the same thing about me

910
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,182
when I'm gone.

911
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:24,276
You were gone, Dad.

912
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:26,217
I already said it.

913
00:47:33,294 --> 00:47:36,730
Well, you sure did get over that fence pretty good

914
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:39,160
for a college professor.

915
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,031
Yeah, well...

916
00:47:41,102 --> 00:47:43,730
I'm not a college professor anymore.

917
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:46,736
I was, uh...

918
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:48,533
I got fired.

919
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,170
It's no big deal.

920
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,476
University cut back the English Department.

921
00:47:58,186 --> 00:47:59,653
Trouble is, it's just hard as hell

922
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:01,951
getting a job teaching these days, you know?

923
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:03,149
I've been looking, and...

924
00:48:03,224 --> 00:48:07,217
schools aren't hiring right now.

925
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:09,957
Anyway, I didn't mean to go on about it.

926
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:13,364
I'll figure something out.

927
00:48:13,434 --> 00:48:15,129
I don't suppose you'd be interested

928
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:17,501
in coming to work for me?

929
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:21,141
Ah, yeah,

930
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:22,141
that'd be dumb.

931
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,472
I couldn't pay you very much.

932
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:26,104
Minimum wage?

933
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,977
Well, I could do better than that.

934
00:48:28,049 --> 00:48:29,277
That's fine.

935
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,251
Sure, yeah, that-that, that's fine.

936
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,146
Sure you know how to do this kind of work?

937
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:40,524
How do you think I put myself through college?

938
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:45,557
Peter?

939
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:47,032
Hi, Pop.

940
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:48,432
Is that your dad with you?

941
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:49,970
Hey, Ralph.

942
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:51,300
What's that?

943
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:53,431
That's a brand-new snowblower.

944
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:55,442
Thought you might be able to use it.

945
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,273
I don't know, Sully.

946
00:48:57,345 --> 00:48:59,575
I can't afford something like that.

947
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,638
I don't see why not... didn't cost me anything.

948
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:02,944
Yeah, that's true.

949
00:49:03,017 --> 00:49:04,382
Just as long as I can come back and borrow it

950
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:05,441
every once in a while...

951
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,249
especially if it keeps on like this.

952
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:08,254
No problem.

953
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,290
Yeah, Pop,

954
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:10,289
I think the best thing

955
00:49:10,358 --> 00:49:11,985
would be to keep it in the garage.

956
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:12,992
Under a tarp.

957
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:14,688
Right.

958
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:17,993
Sure thing.

959
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:21,297
This is really awfully good of you, Sully.

960
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,170
Don't mention it.

961
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,435
I'll leave the door open for you, Peter.

962
00:49:28,509 --> 00:49:30,602
Thanks, Pop.

963
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:40,186
Oh, damn, I forgot the aspirin for Mom.

964
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:42,188
Well...

965
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:44,092
why don't you give her one of these?

966
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:46,060
Oh, I don't know, that's...

967
00:49:46,127 --> 00:49:47,719
Don't worry.

968
00:49:47,795 --> 00:49:49,057
She'll thank you for it.

969
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,992
Listen, tonight was pretty, uh...

970
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:58,971
Yeah.

971
00:50:19,327 --> 00:50:21,386
Can I borrow a dollar?

972
00:50:21,462 --> 00:50:22,793
Nope.

973
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,395
You can borrow a jelly donut, though.

974
00:50:24,465 --> 00:50:27,400
You can't borrow a jelly donut.

975
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:28,662
Once you eat it, it's gone.

976
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:30,601
Once you borrow a dollar, it's gone.

977
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:32,400
I'd rather buy you a jelly donut.

978
00:50:32,473 --> 00:50:33,531
Morning, Dad.

979
00:50:33,608 --> 00:50:36,008
Hey, bro, how you doing? Morning, Cass.

980
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,044
Hey, you wouldn't have

981
00:50:37,111 --> 00:50:39,045
another one of those for Will, would you?

982
00:50:39,113 --> 00:50:41,604
Sorry, Peter... that's the last one.

983
00:50:41,682 --> 00:50:43,411
Huh. You don't mind, do you, Sancho?

984
00:50:43,484 --> 00:50:44,712
Hey, did you see...?

985
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:46,720
It's okay. You bringing the kid to work today?

986
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:49,416
Yeah. Mom had to take Ralph to the doctor.

987
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,151
Don't worry. He won't be any trouble.

988
00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:52,493
Not the point.

989
00:50:52,493 --> 00:50:53,721
Dumb... what if he gets hurt?

990
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:55,126
How?

991
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,128
He could fall in a ditch.

992
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:57,323
He could run into a nail. I don't know.

993
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:01,763
What's so funny?

994
00:51:02,003 --> 00:51:03,402
Nothing.

995
00:51:04,806 --> 00:51:07,707
You mean, I worry about him, and I never worried about you?

996
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:10,209
Well, you skipped a generation, didn't you?

997
00:51:14,148 --> 00:51:16,582
Okay.

998
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:18,778
Why don't you guys get going?

999
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,648
I got some stuff to do in town.

1000
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:23,781
I could take Will with me.

1001
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,515
That okay with you?

1002
00:51:25,593 --> 00:51:26,457
You stay with your granddad?

1003
00:51:26,527 --> 00:51:29,655
All right. Great.

1004
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,595
Come on, Sancho, let's go to work.

1005
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,534
How come I got to go to work with him?

1006
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:41,074
'Cause I say so.

1007
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:43,133
Well, why are you so nice to him?

1008
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:45,702
He doesn't even like you.

1009
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,077
I know...

1010
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:50,316
but I'm growing on him.

1011
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,818
Come on, hot shot.

1012
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,656
You want to drive?

1013
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:11,397
Come on over... come on, scoot over.

1014
00:52:11,472 --> 00:52:13,804
There you go.

1015
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,669
Just be careful of my bum leg, okay?

1016
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:17,802
Ah...

1017
00:52:18,045 --> 00:52:19,205
There you go.

1018
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,214
Put your hands on the wheel right up here.

1019
00:52:21,282 --> 00:52:22,374
There you go.

1020
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,542
Got it? Huh?

1021
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:24,676
Yeah.

1022
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:25,719
All right.

1023
00:52:27,321 --> 00:52:29,118
See how it goes there?

1024
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:35,125
Okay, you're on your own, kid.

1025
00:52:35,229 --> 00:52:37,322
Ooh, there, whoa...

1026
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:38,330
ho-ho-ho.

1027
00:52:38,399 --> 00:52:40,026
There you go. Back... there you go.

1028
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:41,068
There you go.

1029
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:42,067
It's jiggling.

1030
00:52:42,136 --> 00:52:44,661
No, it's not jiggling... it's wobbling.

1031
00:52:44,739 --> 00:52:46,639
That's what old trucks do,

1032
00:52:46,707 --> 00:52:48,402
they wobble.

1033
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:52,503
I like it. It's a nice truck.

1034
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,638
Yeah, it is.

1035
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:57,047
It is kind of a nice truck, isn't it?

1036
00:53:08,162 --> 00:53:09,789
An invoice...

1037
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:12,465
from how long ago?

1038
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:15,195
No, there's no sign of it, Leon. Mm-mmm.

1039
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:16,293
Sorry.

1040
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,204
I'll keep looking...

1041
00:53:20,274 --> 00:53:22,333
but no promises, okay?

1042
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,342
Okay. Bye.

1043
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,311
So, what's going on?

1044
00:53:25,379 --> 00:53:26,539
Where's Ruby?

1045
00:53:26,614 --> 00:53:28,707
Alas, Ruby is no more.

1046
00:53:28,783 --> 00:53:32,048
She left behind a few tokens of her affection.

1047
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:33,643
Want a souvenir?

1048
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:37,452
No, I don't think so.

1049
00:53:37,525 --> 00:53:38,719
So, where's Dummy?

1050
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:40,420
He's out at the annex.

1051
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:42,724
He says that he's turned over a new leaf.

1052
00:53:42,797 --> 00:53:46,164
He says that he's a changed man.

1053
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,292
No kidding.

1054
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:50,769
Who's this?

1055
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:51,770
Mmm?

1056
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,329
That's Will. He's, um...

1057
00:53:54,508 --> 00:53:56,499
Hmm?

1058
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:59,011
Well, he's my... um...

1059
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,012
he's just kind of shy,

1060
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:03,050
you know, so I don't...

1061
00:54:03,184 --> 00:54:05,345
Annex, huh?

1062
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:06,408
Yeah.

1063
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,281
You know, when Ruby was here,

1064
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,294
she used to wear a see-through blouse,

1065
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:17,490
so if you just want to keep up with it...

1066
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:23,729
Okay.

1067
00:54:23,804 --> 00:54:26,136
What's the matter, Grandpa?

1068
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,832
What's the matter, Grandpa?

1069
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:33,678
I'll see you.

1070
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:41,451
Say hello to Will here.

1071
00:54:41,522 --> 00:54:43,046
Hey, Will.

1072
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:53,594
The only thing I have is from 1992,

1073
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,693
and it says right on this... Not an...

1074
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,260
It says, Not an invoice,

1075
00:54:57,338 --> 00:54:59,272
and I'm not going to pay it, all right?

1076
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,637
What?

1077
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:03,643
You get it figured out and get back to me, all right?

1078
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:06,680
Hey, Don Sullivan... thief of snowblowers,

1079
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:10,376
poisoner of dogs, secret father and grandfather.

1080
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:11,713
How they hanging?

1081
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:13,083
By a thread, as usual.

1082
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:15,583
Want to sit over here?

1083
00:55:15,656 --> 00:55:17,453
Just don't mess things up.

1084
00:55:18,526 --> 00:55:20,790
Your grandpa tell you

1085
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:22,385
how he steals people's snowblowers?

1086
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:24,522
You ought to feel sorry for a guy like that.

1087
00:55:24,598 --> 00:55:26,828
You know, he can't keep track of his toy.

1088
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:34,163
That's funny how that dog hates you.

1089
00:55:36,477 --> 00:55:37,535
That's pitiful, isn't it?

1090
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:40,705
Perfectly good Doberman, mean as hell...

1091
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:42,271
ruined.

1092
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:44,044
You seem full of piss and vinegar today.

1093
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:48,152
I was talking to Toby.

1094
00:55:48,222 --> 00:55:50,053
She said you were turning over a new leaf.

1095
00:55:50,124 --> 00:55:52,359
You spoke to Toby?

1096
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:53,656
Yeah.

1097
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:55,286
I didn't have the heart to remind her

1098
00:55:55,396 --> 00:55:56,454
who she was talking about.

1099
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:59,431
You... you talked to my wife?

1100
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:03,198
Well, forget about it.

1101
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,671
She's probably just telling people she likes.

1102
00:56:11,145 --> 00:56:14,012
Don't tell me she's pregnant.

1103
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:16,072
Knocked up like a cheerleader.

1104
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:22,383
Eh, I suppose now you're going to want to be godfather.

1105
00:56:22,456 --> 00:56:26,256
Hey... I can't be the father and the godfather.

1106
00:56:26,327 --> 00:56:27,794
You got to goddamn do something.

1107
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:30,023
Great white hunter make baby.

1108
00:56:30,097 --> 00:56:31,462
Hah!

1109
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,262
Well, big guy,

1110
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:35,632
down to some business, here.

1111
00:56:35,703 --> 00:56:37,466
I understand you got this Victorian

1112
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:39,406
- that you're going to remodel. - No way.

1113
00:56:39,406 --> 00:56:40,668
It'll give us six months work...

1114
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:42,231
- most of it indoors. - Forget about it.

1115
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:44,106
I got my son to worry about now.

1116
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:45,668
Don't even waste your breath, Sully.

1117
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,680
Victorian house is a big job.

1118
00:56:47,748 --> 00:56:49,147
I need guys with two good knees

1119
00:56:49,283 --> 00:56:51,152
and at least a half a brain between them.

1120
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,143
Guy with half a brain wouldn't work for you.

1121
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:56,484
Drop it.

1122
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:59,526
I should've known better than to bring it up to someone like you.

1123
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:01,083
Come on, hotshot.

1124
00:57:01,162 --> 00:57:03,289
That rattrap of yours still standing over on Bowdin?

1125
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:05,298
Why?

1126
00:57:05,366 --> 00:57:06,355
Come on.

1127
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:08,663
Let's go take a look at it.

1128
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:11,102
I got an idea I want to talk to you about.

1129
00:57:13,507 --> 00:57:16,032
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1130
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,445
You know who he reminds me of?

1131
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:19,707
You.

1132
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,578
Yeah, he is pretty well hung at that.

1133
00:57:34,161 --> 00:57:36,595
Stay down here for a second, will you, Will?

1134
00:57:38,532 --> 00:57:40,466
Watch your step, Grandpop.

1135
00:57:52,746 --> 00:57:53,872
Hey, hey, Sully.

1136
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:56,206
Hey, Sully, wait a minute.

1137
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:57,716
Why don't you just break one of the windowpanes

1138
00:57:57,785 --> 00:57:59,184
and reach inside and unlock the door.

1139
00:57:59,253 --> 00:58:01,380
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1140
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,389
Don't say a word.

1141
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:16,128
Excuse me.

1142
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,781
I don't know.

1143
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,725
I don't know.

1144
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:44,593
I may owe Rub an apology.

1145
00:58:44,665 --> 00:58:48,294
He may not be the dumbest man in Bath.

1146
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:55,740
Goddamn, Sully, you could've saved this place.

1147
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:59,142
Could've fixed it up a little bit, rented it out.

1148
00:58:59,213 --> 00:59:02,649
Hell, you could've sold it... put the money in your own pocket.

1149
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:07,653
But you just let it rot.

1150
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:11,179
Just so you could stick it to your old man, huh?

1151
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:14,523
What's he been dead, 30, 35 years?

1152
00:59:14,595 --> 00:59:17,655
You still keeping score?

1153
00:59:17,731 --> 00:59:22,532
Well, here's the good news: You won.

1154
00:59:22,603 --> 00:59:25,299
This could be your crowning achievement, Sully.

1155
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:31,601
All right, I'll make you a deal.

1156
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:34,615
You sell me this flooring here, at a reasonable price,

1157
00:59:34,615 --> 00:59:36,810
and I'll let you and the other two stooges

1158
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:38,476
work on the Victorian house.

1159
00:59:40,554 --> 00:59:42,749
Sully.

1160
00:59:42,823 --> 00:59:45,758
You okay?

1161
00:59:48,395 --> 00:59:50,522
Take it.

1162
00:59:50,597 --> 00:59:51,894
What?

1163
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:53,326
Take it. Just...

1164
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:58,167
Pull out whatever you want.

1165
00:59:58,238 --> 01:00:00,502
Give the money to Peter, okay?

1166
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:03,168
Hey, where's that little kid?

1167
01:00:07,147 --> 01:00:09,138
Will?

1168
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:15,450
You didn't think I forgot you, did you?

1169
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:16,887
Huh?

1170
01:00:16,957 --> 01:00:20,518
Well, I... I didn't mean to.

1171
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:25,461
You want to go inside

1172
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:26,556
and see where I grew up?

1173
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:28,464
You'd like it.

1174
01:00:30,571 --> 01:00:32,937
Okay, you decide.

1175
01:00:33,173 --> 01:00:34,640
You can come inside with me or...

1176
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,471
or you can go back and see your dad.

1177
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:37,771
Okay.

1178
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:39,745
Okay, which?

1179
01:00:41,882 --> 01:00:44,407
Go see Dad.

1180
01:00:47,454 --> 01:00:50,446
Sure. Okay. Let's go.

1181
01:01:08,709 --> 01:01:11,143
Your dad's right over there, okay?

1182
01:01:15,883 --> 01:01:17,373
Hey.

1183
01:01:21,622 --> 01:01:23,647
It's okay.

1184
01:01:26,627 --> 01:01:28,424
You forgot him?

1185
01:01:28,495 --> 01:01:31,123
Well, it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes.

1186
01:01:31,198 --> 01:01:33,598
Yeah, well it probably seemed like longer to him.

1187
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:35,635
Probably seemed like... forever to him.

1188
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:38,603
You know, you... God, I should've known.

1189
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:42,233
You're never going to change, are you?

1190
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:19,506
I'd like to talk to Will.

1191
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,243
I'd like to talk to my grandson.

1192
01:02:29,923 --> 01:02:31,823
Hey, hotshot.

1193
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:36,261
Kind of messed up today, didn't I?

1194
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:42,394
I mean, you were pretty scared, weren't you?

1195
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:48,907
You know what I used to do

1196
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:51,274
when I was your age and I got scared?

1197
01:02:51,345 --> 01:02:55,714
I'd try to be brave for exactly a minute,

1198
01:02:55,782 --> 01:02:57,909
and the next time,

1199
01:02:58,152 --> 01:03:00,211
I'd try to be brave for two minutes.

1200
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:03,450
What were you scared of?

1201
01:03:03,524 --> 01:03:08,393
I don't remember, but, hey...

1202
01:03:08,462 --> 01:03:12,796
when you get to be my age, you won't remember either.

1203
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:14,857
Here.

1204
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:20,638
You can time yourself with it.

1205
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,733
The big hand'll go around once... that'll be a minute.

1206
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:26,745
Goes around again... that'll be two minutes.

1207
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:29,680
Then you can tell how long you've been brave.

1208
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,685
Here.

1209
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:36,787
Thank you.

1210
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:40,784
You're welcome.

1211
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:52,899
Can I ask you a question?

1212
01:03:55,442 --> 01:03:57,273
Why'd you do it...

1213
01:03:57,344 --> 01:03:58,436
walk out on us?

1214
01:03:58,512 --> 01:04:01,572
Oh... how the hell do I know?

1215
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:05,516
It was, um...

1216
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:08,419
a mistake.

1217
01:04:08,488 --> 01:04:11,457
Me and your mother was just a mistake.

1218
01:04:11,558 --> 01:04:14,550
What would you like me to say?

1219
01:04:14,628 --> 01:04:16,391
I was a rotten father?

1220
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:20,866
Well, I wasn't around enough for that, remember?

1221
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:23,368
Not around. Not ever.

1222
01:04:23,437 --> 01:04:25,268
Satisfied?

1223
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,363
Well...

1224
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,237
if you're not a father to me,

1225
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:30,538
how come you're a grandfather to Will?

1226
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:35,173
'Cause you got to start someplace.

1227
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,905
You alive in there, old girl?

1228
01:05:36,977 --> 01:05:39,241
Didn't die in your sleep, di...

1229
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:55,386
Well, what happened? What did he say?

1230
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:59,125
If I tell you, will you promise not to tell my son about it?

1231
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:01,461
No, I can't do that.

1232
01:06:01,535 --> 01:06:03,901
Well, then, I won't tell you.

1233
01:06:04,204 --> 01:06:05,432
Let's go.

1234
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:09,940
No, I can do that.

1235
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:18,683
All right, I won't tell him.

1236
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:20,276
Now, what happened?

1237
01:06:20,354 --> 01:06:22,618
It was a stroke.

1238
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:23,951
A what?

1239
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,593
A stroke. Just a tiny one.

1240
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:29,824
It's not uncommon in people of my age,

1241
01:06:29,896 --> 01:06:32,799
but he gave me medication, and he said if I'm careful,

1242
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,700
there's no reason I shouldn't live for a long time.

1243
01:06:35,769 --> 01:06:37,464
I'm calling Clive Jr. Right now.

1244
01:06:37,537 --> 01:06:38,799
No, no, Donald, you promised.

1245
01:06:38,872 --> 01:06:40,271
He's your son. He's got a right.

1246
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,602
Donald.

1247
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:44,906
If you tell Clive about this, he'll put me in a rest home,

1248
01:06:44,978 --> 01:06:47,469
and there'll be nothing I can do about it.

1249
01:06:47,547 --> 01:06:50,573
You know I'm right about that.

1250
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:54,546
And if he did...

1251
01:06:54,621 --> 01:06:57,283
I don't think I could bear it.

1252
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:59,791
Okay, but, uh...

1253
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,828
you're going to...

1254
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,363
need someone who can really look after you.

1255
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:05,830
I have someone to look after me.

1256
01:07:05,899 --> 01:07:07,890
No, no, I don't think so.

1257
01:07:07,968 --> 01:07:10,436
I don't think that's a good idea.

1258
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:14,565
Do you still bet on that horse race of yours?

1259
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:16,404
What, the trifecta?

1260
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:17,704
Yes. Has it ever come in?

1261
01:07:17,778 --> 01:07:19,370
Not yet.

1262
01:07:19,446 --> 01:07:20,640
But you still bet on it.

1263
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:21,840
Well, sure, I mean,

1264
01:07:21,915 --> 01:07:23,610
the odds have got to kick in sooner or later.

1265
01:07:23,683 --> 01:07:26,481
Fine... that's exactly the way I feel about you.

1266
01:07:26,553 --> 01:07:27,679
Now, will you please

1267
01:07:27,754 --> 01:07:29,779
drive me home?

1268
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:36,287
Thank you, Donald.

1269
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,661
Wish you hadn't told me those were rats down there.

1270
01:07:39,733 --> 01:07:42,463
Know what else I wish?

1271
01:07:42,536 --> 01:07:43,935
What?

1272
01:07:44,037 --> 01:07:47,336
I wish some big old company would moved to town,

1273
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:49,967
pay us a lot of money.

1274
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:52,409
We could work indoors.

1275
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:55,415
No more Carl Roebuck.

1276
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:58,646
Know what I really wish?

1277
01:07:58,718 --> 01:08:02,556
I really wish Peter'd quit calling me Sancho.

1278
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:03,921
I hate that name.

1279
01:08:04,224 --> 01:08:09,184
Fact is, I wish Peter'd just flat go away.

1280
01:08:09,262 --> 01:08:10,286
What?

1281
01:08:10,363 --> 01:08:14,663
I said, I wish Peter'd go on back to his own home.

1282
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:17,726
I liked it better when it was just the two of us.

1283
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:22,172
I hate it the way you talk to him all the time.

1284
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:30,215
You know, used to be you and me'd go places together.

1285
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:32,251
Now he's always there.

1286
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,843
He's my son.

1287
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,480
Shh. He's coming.

1288
01:08:36,556 --> 01:08:37,580
Hey, Sancho.

1289
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:38,646
See what I mean?

1290
01:08:38,725 --> 01:08:40,352
- Any luck? - Yeah.

1291
01:08:40,427 --> 01:08:41,359
I think I found a place.

1292
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:42,895
- Hey. - What place?

1293
01:08:42,963 --> 01:08:44,760
Two bedroom apartment for me and Will.

1294
01:08:44,831 --> 01:08:46,298
It's in a nice neighborhood,

1295
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:47,993
rent's not too bad.

1296
01:08:48,235 --> 01:08:49,998
You mean, you're... you're going to stay?

1297
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:53,670
Yeah. Pretty much made up my mind.

1298
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,676
He's going to... stay here, work with us from now on?

1299
01:08:57,744 --> 01:08:59,678
Looks like it.

1300
01:08:59,746 --> 01:09:01,441
Well, wh...

1301
01:09:01,515 --> 01:09:04,177
there's not enough work for the three of us.

1302
01:09:04,251 --> 01:09:06,549
Why don't you let me worry about that.

1303
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:09,556
Well, I don't like it.

1304
01:09:09,556 --> 01:09:10,648
You don't have to like it.

1305
01:09:14,995 --> 01:09:18,522
Hey, Sully, could I have a beer?

1306
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:19,564
What are you asking me for?

1307
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,260
'Cause you're the boss.

1308
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:22,266
Ask him.

1309
01:09:22,335 --> 01:09:23,495
He bought the beer.

1310
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,162
Here you go, Sancho.

1311
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:40,477
Hey, where you going?

1312
01:09:49,596 --> 01:09:51,530
I quit.

1313
01:09:53,466 --> 01:09:54,831
Rub!

1314
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:56,960
Shit. Oh...

1315
01:09:57,037 --> 01:09:59,505
Come on back here.

1316
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:24,762
Dad... Dad, you're driving on the sidewalk.

1317
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:26,389
Relax.

1318
01:10:26,466 --> 01:10:27,490
Look at that.

1319
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,535
You ever seen anybody that stubborn?

1320
01:10:29,603 --> 01:10:31,571
Yes, I have.

1321
01:10:33,406 --> 01:10:34,430
Can't figure it out.

1322
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:35,474
All he's got to do

1323
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:37,737
is duck behind something and we're screwed.

1324
01:10:37,811 --> 01:10:39,745
Oh, I'd have to say we're screwed anyhow.

1325
01:10:53,093 --> 01:10:54,720
Sully, you're on the sidewalk!

1326
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:57,552
Up yours, Raymer.

1327
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,681
That's not a good place to park,

1328
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:19,980
Raymer.

1329
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:22,283
Enough!

1330
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,787
Get out of the truck now, Sully!

1331
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:27,520
Fun's over... I'm going to have

1332
01:11:27,594 --> 01:11:29,255
to put you under arrest.

1333
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:34,357
This is where a smart guy would get out of the truck.

1334
01:11:34,434 --> 01:11:35,992
- Come on, Dad. - Suit yourself.

1335
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:44,270
Halt!

1336
01:11:44,377 --> 01:11:45,639
Jesus, Dad!

1337
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:47,043
He'll never use it.

1338
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:52,681
Did he shoot?

1339
01:11:52,752 --> 01:11:54,379
I believe that was a gunshot, yes.

1340
01:11:54,454 --> 01:11:56,752
I vote we surrender, if I have a vote.

1341
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:19,510
You stupid prick.

1342
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:31,253
Well?

1343
01:12:31,357 --> 01:12:32,449
Nothing.

1344
01:12:32,525 --> 01:12:34,459
Good.

1345
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:36,654
For a moment there, I thought you were going to be critical.

1346
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,528
Haven't I been warning you about something like this?

1347
01:12:39,599 --> 01:12:40,531
Clive...

1348
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,261
Haven't I? The man's a lunatic.

1349
01:12:42,335 --> 01:12:43,734
I'm sure there's an explanation.

1350
01:12:43,803 --> 01:12:47,068
What explanation can there be for attacking a policeman?

1351
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,904
I suppose I should be grateful he didn't go berserk right here

1352
01:12:49,976 --> 01:12:51,102
in this house.

1353
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:55,007
I want Donald Sullivan out of here,

1354
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:57,447
and I want him out of here now.

1355
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:03,582
And if you won't do it,

1356
01:13:03,656 --> 01:13:05,647
I will.

1357
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:14,396
Hmm... I hate to say it,

1358
01:13:14,467 --> 01:13:17,698
but for once in his life, The Bank is right.

1359
01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:20,535
I screwed up.

1360
01:13:20,607 --> 01:13:23,838
Looks like I'll be spending a...

1361
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:26,071
a little vacation at the County's expense,

1362
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:28,576
so you'd better get yourself another tenant.

1363
01:13:28,648 --> 01:13:31,082
I don't want another tenant.

1364
01:13:31,317 --> 01:13:33,342
I've enjoyed your company.

1365
01:13:33,419 --> 01:13:37,287
Face it, Beryl, I'm the wrong man for the job.

1366
01:13:37,357 --> 01:13:39,450
Maybe it'll teach us both

1367
01:13:39,526 --> 01:13:41,585
not to bet on long shots.

1368
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:56,032
What do you think?

1369
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:03,340
Sure doesn't feel like Christmas.

1370
01:14:05,952 --> 01:14:07,943
Get Rub to help you with the floors.

1371
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:09,248
Don't forget.

1372
01:14:09,322 --> 01:14:11,256
Okay.

1373
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:13,758
You can always get him down at the diner, you know.

1374
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,055
Right.

1375
01:14:16,296 --> 01:14:17,786
You know how to use a circular saw?

1376
01:14:17,864 --> 01:14:20,662
Better than you.

1377
01:14:20,733 --> 01:14:22,997
I doubt it.

1378
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:26,503
How long do you think it'll take you to finish?

1379
01:14:26,573 --> 01:14:27,562
Couple of days.

1380
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,267
Hmm. Well, get Rub...

1381
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:30,570
Get Rub to help.

1382
01:14:32,812 --> 01:14:36,612
Did I give you the keys to the Ford?

1383
01:14:36,683 --> 01:14:37,984
About an hour and a half ago.

1384
01:14:37,984 --> 01:14:39,781
Well, if you get any trouble with it,

1385
01:14:39,853 --> 01:14:41,787
just take it down to the Texaco station.

1386
01:14:41,855 --> 01:14:44,016
There's a guy down there by the name of Harold.

1387
01:14:44,324 --> 01:14:44,881
He's the owner.

1388
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,755
Just tell him you're my son.

1389
01:14:46,826 --> 01:14:50,387
Right. You run into problems, drop your old man's name.

1390
01:14:50,463 --> 01:14:51,953
Watch the doors fly open.

1391
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,932
Can't believe it's going to take you that long

1392
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:56,491
to get me out of jail.

1393
01:14:56,569 --> 01:14:57,968
Don't blame me... I'm a Jew.

1394
01:14:58,271 --> 01:14:59,761
These aren't my holidays.

1395
01:14:59,839 --> 01:15:01,272
A Jew... really?

1396
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:05,709
I didn't know that.

1397
01:15:05,778 --> 01:15:07,871
How come you ain't smart?

1398
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:13,952
How can I start getting you out of jail

1399
01:15:14,087 --> 01:15:16,055
when you won't go in?

1400
01:15:16,289 --> 01:15:17,483
Got a point.

1401
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:30,428
A condemned man gets a last wish, right?

1402
01:15:32,505 --> 01:15:33,870
I got my truck out back.

1403
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,465
How 'bout you and me go out there and get ourselves naked

1404
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,839
and then just see what happens?

1405
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:41,740
Okay.

1406
01:15:41,814 --> 01:15:44,044
Haven't you got any pride?

1407
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:45,674
Go to jail, Sully.

1408
01:15:45,752 --> 01:15:47,617
It's where you belong.

1409
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,655
Look, your kid's asleep.

1410
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:57,489
I haven't seen him like this since he was six months old.

1411
01:16:02,835 --> 01:16:04,735
Touching, isn't it?

1412
01:16:04,804 --> 01:16:06,669
Breaks your heart.

1413
01:16:07,774 --> 01:16:08,968
Wake up.

1414
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:10,632
Oh, God...

1415
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,371
let's get out of here.

1416
01:16:15,682 --> 01:16:19,015
- Get the check, will you? - I'll pay your check.

1417
01:16:20,653 --> 01:16:23,022
You okay?

1418
01:16:23,022 --> 01:16:24,546
Yeah.

1419
01:16:24,624 --> 01:16:27,491
Wirf will have you out of there in a couple of days.

1420
01:16:29,696 --> 01:16:32,722
Ralph's been a good father to you, you know?

1421
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:35,859
Yes, he has.

1422
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:37,869
You turned out all right.

1423
01:16:37,937 --> 01:16:41,532
So did you.

1424
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:44,337
Want to hear something funny?

1425
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:47,402
I never told anybody this before.

1426
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,107
After I got out of the Army,

1427
01:16:49,349 --> 01:16:51,749
I went to college for about six months.

1428
01:16:51,818 --> 01:16:53,752
I really liked it.

1429
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,685
Why did you quit?

1430
01:16:55,755 --> 01:16:58,280
I said I liked it... I didn't say I belonged there.

1431
01:16:58,358 --> 01:17:00,758
Well, where do you belong, Dad?

1432
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:04,986
Right there.

1433
01:17:07,767 --> 01:17:09,962
For tonight, anyway.

1434
01:17:10,069 --> 01:17:13,266
Want me to go in there with you?

1435
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:14,533
Nope.

1436
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:15,869
Good.

1437
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:27,783
Well, I'll be out before you know it.

1438
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,051
Hey!

1439
01:17:35,595 --> 01:17:37,756
Look after Wirf, will you?

1440
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:40,696
And Miss Beryl?

1441
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:42,598
Right.

1442
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:48,738
Oh...

1443
01:17:51,644 --> 01:17:54,408
Take care of Rub's jelly donuts.

1444
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,914
It's not going to be easy being you, is it?

1445
01:17:56,983 --> 01:17:58,416
Don't expect too much

1446
01:17:58,484 --> 01:17:59,883
of yourself at the beginning.

1447
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:03,012
I couldn't do everything at first, either.

1448
01:18:33,386 --> 01:18:34,944
But you gave me your word.

1449
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:36,613
People here are counting on you.

1450
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:38,384
I'm counting on you.

1451
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:41,427
Mr. Peoples, did we sign any papers?

1452
01:18:41,494 --> 01:18:43,519
Now, listen, this is nothing personal.

1453
01:18:43,596 --> 01:18:46,030
I know how much you good people wanted this thing to happen,

1454
01:18:46,099 --> 01:18:48,897
but it's flat out not going to work.

1455
01:18:48,968 --> 01:18:50,333
Why?

1456
01:18:50,403 --> 01:18:52,371
Well, the fact is we crunched the numbers,

1457
01:18:52,438 --> 01:18:53,496
and they didn't add up.

1458
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:55,040
But you don't understand.

1459
01:18:55,108 --> 01:18:56,939
These people bought a thousand acres

1460
01:18:57,009 --> 01:18:58,943
of depressed real estate because of you.

1461
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:00,876
Oh, you got that wrong, Clive.

1462
01:19:00,947 --> 01:19:03,347
Those people bought that land because of you.

1463
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:05,680
You promised that this was a sure thing.

1464
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:08,515
Well, we were a teeny bit wrong about that, wasn't we?

1465
01:19:08,588 --> 01:19:09,782
But...

1466
01:19:09,856 --> 01:19:12,017
It's been good talking to you. Nighty-night.

1467
01:19:15,828 --> 01:19:17,796
Merry Christmas, Mr. Peoples.

1468
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:22,627
Merry Christmas.

1469
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:28,100
Thanks, Ollie.

1470
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:29,725
God, I love small towns.

1471
01:20:29,835 --> 01:20:30,859
Where else in the world

1472
01:20:30,937 --> 01:20:32,666
would they let a guy out of jail for three hours

1473
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:33,966
just to serve as a pall bearer?

1474
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,041
Yeah.

1475
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,042
Been arraigned yet?

1476
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:37,600
No... this afternoon.

1477
01:20:37,677 --> 01:20:38,871
How you going to plead?

1478
01:20:38,945 --> 01:20:40,640
Temporary insanity.

1479
01:20:40,713 --> 01:20:42,908
We're going to say that those pills you gave me

1480
01:20:42,982 --> 01:20:44,108
made me absolutely nuts.

1481
01:20:52,124 --> 01:20:53,614
All right, girls, we're on.

1482
01:20:57,463 --> 01:20:58,896
All right, here we go.

1483
01:20:58,965 --> 01:21:01,160
One, two, three.

1484
01:21:03,636 --> 01:21:05,661
Well, you must be feeling great.

1485
01:21:05,738 --> 01:21:08,764
Well, why should I be feeling great... I'm in jail.

1486
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:09,967
Truck's falling apart...

1487
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:11,168
I haven't got 40 bucks to my name.

1488
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:12,468
Yeah, but the trifecta

1489
01:21:12,545 --> 01:21:15,105
you've been betting for ten years finally hit.

1490
01:21:15,414 --> 01:21:16,574
Hey, be careful!

1491
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:17,581
My trifecta?

1492
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:18,617
Yeah.

1493
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:20,379
You mean, the one I've been betting every day?

1494
01:21:20,453 --> 01:21:22,819
It hit two days ago.

1495
01:21:22,888 --> 01:21:25,458
Well, I was in jail. I didn't bet it.

1496
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:27,119
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?

1497
01:21:28,694 --> 01:21:29,991
Now do you believe in luck?

1498
01:21:30,062 --> 01:21:32,121
Luck had nothing to do with you being in jail.

1499
01:21:32,231 --> 01:21:34,131
Did you hear about Clive Jr.?

1500
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:35,393
No, what?

1501
01:21:35,468 --> 01:21:36,435
He skipped town.

1502
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:38,435
- Hey! - Oh, ho...

1503
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:40,699
Mr. Sullivan, have a little respect.

1504
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:41,705
What?

1505
01:21:41,774 --> 01:21:43,639
The money for the theme park folded.

1506
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:47,008
Bank's stuck with all that worthless land.

1507
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:49,445
So he disappeared.

1508
01:21:49,515 --> 01:21:51,540
Well, what about Miss Beryl?

1509
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:53,517
Not great.

1510
01:21:53,586 --> 01:21:55,053
Boy...

1511
01:21:55,121 --> 01:21:56,713
Guy goes to jail for a couple of days...

1512
01:21:56,789 --> 01:21:58,620
the whole town goes to hell.

1513
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,092
Sully?

1514
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:03,150
Yeah, Ralph?

1515
01:22:03,396 --> 01:22:05,830
Listen, remember that snowblower you gave me?

1516
01:22:05,898 --> 01:22:06,865
Yeah?

1517
01:22:06,932 --> 01:22:09,457
Well, somebody stole it last night...

1518
01:22:09,535 --> 01:22:11,400
right out of the garage.

1519
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:15,702
I... I covered it with a tarp just the way you told me...

1520
01:22:15,775 --> 01:22:17,436
Don't worry about it.

1521
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,842
I know exactly where to find it.

1522
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,014
Never in a million years.

1523
01:22:40,099 --> 01:22:43,000
Well... here we are again, Mr. Sullivan.

1524
01:22:43,069 --> 01:22:44,866
How's your knee?

1525
01:22:44,937 --> 01:22:45,904
Rotten.

1526
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,572
Your Honor.

1527
01:22:48,641 --> 01:22:49,665
Well, it doesn't seem

1528
01:22:49,742 --> 01:22:50,834
to slow you down much.

1529
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:53,970
Doesn't keep you from punching out policemen or anything.

1530
01:22:54,046 --> 01:22:54,978
Your Honor...

1531
01:22:55,047 --> 01:22:56,139
Mr. Wirfley, don't.

1532
01:22:56,215 --> 01:22:58,376
There are times when less is more,

1533
01:22:58,451 --> 01:22:59,543
and this is one of them.

1534
01:22:59,618 --> 01:23:00,642
Now, then...

1535
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:02,050
How are you doing, Wyatt Earp?

1536
01:23:02,121 --> 01:23:03,053
Your Honor...

1537
01:23:03,122 --> 01:23:04,054
Same advice:

1538
01:23:04,123 --> 01:23:06,421
Less is more.

1539
01:23:07,593 --> 01:23:09,823
Tell me, what do you usually do

1540
01:23:09,895 --> 01:23:11,055
when somebody throws a punch at you?

1541
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:19,762
Duck.

1542
01:23:19,839 --> 01:23:22,137
Next time, do that.

1543
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:25,836
Now, is it true that you discharged your weapon, Officer?

1544
01:23:25,911 --> 01:23:27,970
Your Honor, it was a warning shot.

1545
01:23:28,047 --> 01:23:30,015
Mm-hmm. You know who you warned?

1546
01:23:30,082 --> 01:23:32,448
A little old lady sitting on her commode

1547
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:34,145
two blocks away.

1548
01:23:34,453 --> 01:23:35,147
Ollie...

1549
01:23:35,454 --> 01:23:37,786
you know my feelings about arming morons.

1550
01:23:37,857 --> 01:23:40,155
You arm one, you've got to arm them all,

1551
01:23:40,459 --> 01:23:42,086
otherwise it wouldn't be good sport.

1552
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:45,096
Your Honor, Officer Raymer is currently under suspension.

1553
01:23:45,164 --> 01:23:46,927
Anesthesia is what he should be under.

1554
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:48,091
Your Honor!

1555
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:51,500
I'd just like to say, and what's this country coming to...

1556
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,198
Raymer, shut the fuck up.

1557
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:50,895
Boy, I wouldn't sit here too long.

1558
01:24:50,963 --> 01:24:55,127
Tip of your dick'll freeze to the top of the step.

1559
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:57,499
Oh, I forgot... yours ain't that long.

1560
01:24:59,004 --> 01:25:01,666
Yours ain't either.

1561
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,140
It's 'cause I fold it.

1562
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:07,873
Want to know how many times I fold it?

1563
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:10,074
It would hurt if you folded it.

1564
01:25:10,182 --> 01:25:11,774
Not mine.

1565
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:21,726
Know what I wish?

1566
01:25:21,827 --> 01:25:23,385
No. What do you wish?

1567
01:25:26,131 --> 01:25:28,827
I wish we were still friends.

1568
01:25:30,636 --> 01:25:32,069
We are, Rub.

1569
01:25:34,974 --> 01:25:36,771
You know what I wish?

1570
01:25:36,842 --> 01:25:39,208
I wish we'd get off our asses.

1571
01:25:39,445 --> 01:25:41,504
Let's go down to The Horse and place some poker.

1572
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,207
What do you think?

1573
01:25:47,186 --> 01:25:48,983
Wha-what about...

1574
01:25:50,523 --> 01:25:51,785
Peter?

1575
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:56,090
Hey, look at me.

1576
01:25:59,131 --> 01:26:01,463
Peter's my son...

1577
01:26:04,503 --> 01:26:08,496
and you're my best friend, okay?

1578
01:26:16,215 --> 01:26:18,740
Ah...

1579
01:26:18,817 --> 01:26:20,546
you're not going to start crying, are you?

1580
01:26:24,857 --> 01:26:27,223
I should've stayed in jail.

1581
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,805
I can bet 40.

1582
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:44,276
Oh, boy.

1583
01:26:44,276 --> 01:26:46,779
I'm in.

1584
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:48,644
I don't want to be in, but I'm in.

1585
01:26:48,714 --> 01:26:49,703
Okay, sucker.

1586
01:26:49,815 --> 01:26:51,009
I'll see you...

1587
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,015
and...

1588
01:26:54,153 --> 01:26:56,781
I'll raise you.

1589
01:26:56,855 --> 01:26:59,153
He's bluffing.

1590
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:01,454
Goddamn it, Birdy, close the door.

1591
01:27:01,527 --> 01:27:02,960
I'm sitting here naked.

1592
01:27:03,028 --> 01:27:04,393
Then you should play better poker.

1593
01:27:04,463 --> 01:27:05,794
Jocko.

1594
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,934
He's in.

1595
01:27:10,002 --> 01:27:11,401
Oh, thank you, Birdy.

1596
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:12,402
Mm-hmm.

1597
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:17,768
Don't show him your cards, Rub.

1598
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,208
I call.

1599
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:24,115
Ace-high flush.

1600
01:27:24,183 --> 01:27:26,549
Read 'em and weep, guys.

1601
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:27,586
Queens full.

1602
01:27:27,653 --> 01:27:28,654
Why not?

1603
01:27:28,654 --> 01:27:30,781
Damn, why shouldn't this be the night

1604
01:27:30,856 --> 01:27:33,086
I lose every goddamn hand in the game.

1605
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,150
Goddamn theme park goes down the tubes...

1606
01:27:36,228 --> 01:27:38,458
I'm stuck with 14 crappy, half-built houses

1607
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:40,498
I'm never going to be able to unload...

1608
01:27:40,566 --> 01:27:41,760
and on top of all of it,

1609
01:27:41,834 --> 01:27:43,768
for some reason Toby has taken exception

1610
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:45,235
with my new secretary.

1611
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:47,632
Whose gun is that?

1612
01:27:47,706 --> 01:27:51,073
It's yours, bonehead. It was your ante.

1613
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,778
Hell, I should've busted this game two hours ago.

1614
01:27:52,778 --> 01:27:53,779
All right.

1615
01:27:53,779 --> 01:27:55,178
The game is seven card stud.

1616
01:27:55,247 --> 01:27:57,511
One-eyed jacks and suicide kings are wild.

1617
01:27:57,583 --> 01:27:59,016
Oh, come on, Jocko.

1618
01:27:59,084 --> 01:27:59,948
What are all these wild cards?

1619
01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:01,384
Can we just play a normal game of poker?

1620
01:28:01,453 --> 01:28:04,183
How come she's staring at me like that?

1621
01:28:04,423 --> 01:28:06,516
Because you're a good-looking guy, Rub.

1622
01:28:06,592 --> 01:28:07,559
Am not.

1623
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,685
Sure, you are.

1624
01:28:09,762 --> 01:28:12,196
Carl, is he a good-looking guy?

1625
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:13,557
He is at that.

1626
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:14,599
Oh.

1627
01:28:16,635 --> 01:28:18,830
Sully, you might want to drop by the Bowdin Street house

1628
01:28:18,904 --> 01:28:19,836
on the way home.

1629
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:21,600
- Oh, something wrong? - No, nothing's wrong.

1630
01:28:21,674 --> 01:28:23,403
I left you a little something over there.

1631
01:28:23,475 --> 01:28:25,568
Spirit of the season, so to speak.

1632
01:28:29,448 --> 01:28:31,040
- Jocko. - Hmm?

1633
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:33,209
You got any of those yellow doozies around?

1634
01:28:33,452 --> 01:28:34,544
Why, is your leg worse?

1635
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:35,552
No.

1636
01:28:35,621 --> 01:28:37,782
They're for Carl.

1637
01:28:37,856 --> 01:28:41,986
Oh, my God.

1638
01:28:45,064 --> 01:28:46,065
Here.

1639
01:28:46,065 --> 01:28:48,033
Two tickets... Hawaii. You and me.

1640
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,567
Toby...

1641
01:28:49,635 --> 01:28:52,695
There's a perfectly logical explanation for this.

1642
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:54,932
There is?

1643
01:28:55,007 --> 01:28:55,939
Well?

1644
01:28:56,008 --> 01:28:57,236
Hawaii?

1645
01:28:57,309 --> 01:29:00,506
No bullshit?

1646
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:02,103
No bullshit.

1647
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:05,610
Goddamn, Sully,

1648
01:29:05,684 --> 01:29:07,549
when your luck turns...

1649
01:29:07,619 --> 01:29:08,608
it turns.

1650
01:29:08,687 --> 01:29:11,850
Luck has nothing to do with this.

1651
01:29:11,924 --> 01:29:15,121
I'll have to get a new bathing suit.

1652
01:29:15,194 --> 01:29:16,627
The place we're going, you won't need anything.

1653
01:29:16,695 --> 01:29:18,128
I have enough coconut oil for both of us.

1654
01:29:18,197 --> 01:29:21,223
I do you, and you do me.

1655
01:29:21,467 --> 01:29:22,729
Yeah, that's the general idea.

1656
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,928
Oh, for God's sake, Toby... you're pregnant.

1657
01:29:25,003 --> 01:29:26,231
You can be the godfather.

1658
01:29:26,472 --> 01:29:27,234
Shut up, Sully!

1659
01:29:27,473 --> 01:29:29,566
Sunny skies.

1660
01:29:29,641 --> 01:29:31,006
Sandy beaches.

1661
01:29:31,076 --> 01:29:33,909
No more snow, no more broken-down pickup truck.

1662
01:29:33,979 --> 01:29:35,037
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:29:35,147 --> 01:29:37,479
Damn, Carl, you going to let him

1664
01:29:37,549 --> 01:29:39,073
get away with that?

1665
01:29:39,151 --> 01:29:41,244
Aw, don't worry about it, Ollie.

1666
01:29:41,487 --> 01:29:43,478
He'll never go through with it.

1667
01:29:43,555 --> 01:29:44,954
You want to bet?

1668
01:29:45,023 --> 01:29:47,082
Cash me in, guys.

1669
01:29:47,192 --> 01:29:48,784
Oh, I'll bet.

1670
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:51,091
I'll bet you make it

1671
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:53,596
about as far as the plane out of spite.

1672
01:29:53,665 --> 01:29:55,826
But then you know what's going to happen, Sully?

1673
01:29:55,901 --> 01:29:57,493
Somewhere over Kansas,

1674
01:29:57,569 --> 01:29:59,594
Toby's going to start crying,

1675
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:01,036
and as your ex-wife can tell you, Sully,

1676
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,630
you don't handle that shit very well.

1677
01:30:06,044 --> 01:30:08,512
Rub...

1678
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:10,946
in about a minute, that poor son of a bitch

1679
01:30:11,016 --> 01:30:12,040
is going to realize

1680
01:30:12,117 --> 01:30:14,551
he's made the biggest mistake of his life.

1681
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:18,886
He tries to follow us, shoot him.

1682
01:30:25,998 --> 01:30:27,022
Sully.

1683
01:30:28,233 --> 01:30:30,258
You got something to say?

1684
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:43,112
No.

1685
01:30:46,585 --> 01:30:47,745
Fine.

1686
01:31:56,021 --> 01:31:57,648
- Toby... - No, don't.

1687
01:31:57,723 --> 01:31:59,748
Please, don't.

1688
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:03,625
I want to thank you for thinking of me.

1689
01:32:03,695 --> 01:32:05,629
Yeah.

1690
01:32:07,966 --> 01:32:09,991
I, uh...

1691
01:32:10,068 --> 01:32:12,502
You know, until a while ago,

1692
01:32:12,571 --> 01:32:13,629
I could've...

1693
01:32:13,705 --> 01:32:15,263
I could've...

1694
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,570
but...

1695
01:32:18,877 --> 01:32:22,938
I just found out I'm somebody's grandfather.

1696
01:32:23,015 --> 01:32:27,918
I'm somebody's father, and...

1697
01:32:27,986 --> 01:32:30,181
and maybe...

1698
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:32,120
I'm somebody's friend in the bargain.

1699
01:32:33,926 --> 01:32:35,518
So...

1700
01:32:36,695 --> 01:32:39,163
Yeah...

1701
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:42,291
you are a man among men.

1702
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:44,062
I know, it's not a compliment.

1703
01:32:44,136 --> 01:32:46,070
No, this time it is.

1704
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:49,630
How come you're always wrong about everything?

1705
01:32:59,284 --> 01:33:00,842
Mmm...

1706
01:33:10,963 --> 01:33:13,265
You are...

1707
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:16,564
the best...

1708
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:18,830
Iooking woman in Bath, and...

1709
01:33:18,904 --> 01:33:20,305
you're going to be

1710
01:33:20,305 --> 01:33:22,967
the best-looking woman in Hawaii.

1711
01:33:23,041 --> 01:33:25,305
You're going to be fine.

1712
01:33:25,544 --> 01:33:28,536
Thanks.

1713
01:33:43,028 --> 01:33:47,556
We would've been terrific together.

1714
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:51,993
Yeah, I think so.

1715
01:34:31,076 --> 01:34:33,601
Don't tell me they actually let you out of jail.

1716
01:34:33,678 --> 01:34:35,805
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

1717
01:34:35,881 --> 01:34:36,848
I took Will over

1718
01:34:36,915 --> 01:34:38,576
to the new apartment, so he could see his room.

1719
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:40,880
He liked it.

1720
01:34:40,952 --> 01:34:42,214
We were on our way back to Mom's.

1721
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,344
I saw your truck outside.

1722
01:34:43,588 --> 01:34:45,146
Happy New Year.

1723
01:34:45,223 --> 01:34:49,353
It's a day or two early, but... hey, I got faith.

1724
01:34:49,594 --> 01:34:50,754
Thank you.

1725
01:34:50,829 --> 01:34:52,922
To the good life.

1726
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,164
You call this the good life?

1727
01:34:57,235 --> 01:34:58,634
Sure looks like it from where I stand.

1728
01:35:02,841 --> 01:35:05,639
It occurs to me I forgot to give you

1729
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:07,007
your Christmas present.

1730
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:09,070
Call your wife.

1731
01:35:10,282 --> 01:35:11,840
Telephone's right there.

1732
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:13,145
You don't understand...

1733
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:14,218
Do it.

1734
01:35:38,577 --> 01:35:40,738
Hi, it's me.

1735
01:35:40,812 --> 01:35:42,871
Yeah.

1736
01:35:42,948 --> 01:35:44,108
I... I know.

1737
01:35:44,182 --> 01:35:48,778
Hey... don't cry.

1738
01:35:48,854 --> 01:35:51,550
Dad... I can handle this part myself.

1739
01:35:51,623 --> 01:35:53,955
You'd keep my leg, wouldn't you?

1740
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,958
You don't need a leg... you need a parrot.

1741
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,199
Should we give him back his leg?

1742
01:36:09,674 --> 01:36:13,110
You want to take it to him?

1743
01:36:14,613 --> 01:36:16,205
It's not alive... it ain't gonna bite you.

1744
01:36:24,256 --> 01:36:26,224
You still got that stopwatch?

1745
01:36:27,893 --> 01:36:28,985
Want to see if it works?

1746
01:37:03,061 --> 01:37:03,993
Come on.

1747
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:06,121
You think...?

1748
01:37:30,088 --> 01:37:31,885
Thank you.

1749
01:37:43,635 --> 01:37:47,731
Will... your mom wants to talk to you.

1750
01:37:49,241 --> 01:37:50,572
Mom?

1751
01:37:56,881 --> 01:37:57,813
Dick.

1752
01:37:57,882 --> 01:37:59,975
You know, I think I'm getting

1753
01:38:00,051 --> 01:38:01,678
too old for this job.

1754
01:38:01,753 --> 01:38:02,754
How come?

1755
01:38:02,754 --> 01:38:05,757
You're starting to look good to me.

1756
01:38:05,757 --> 01:38:09,056
I do that... I grow on people.

1757
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:17,162
Sommelier, encore, s'il vous plaît.

1758
01:38:21,106 --> 01:38:24,234
Listen, I need a favor.

1759
01:38:24,309 --> 01:38:27,801
I'm serious about this.

1760
01:38:27,879 --> 01:38:29,608
It's your landlady.

1761
01:38:29,681 --> 01:38:32,172
She's done something for you.

1762
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,308
What?

1763
01:38:33,385 --> 01:38:37,822
You own the house on Bowdin again.

1764
01:38:37,889 --> 01:38:41,188
She paid the back taxes.

1765
01:38:44,829 --> 01:38:45,887
And you let her?

1766
01:38:45,964 --> 01:38:47,124
I encouraged her.

1767
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:48,961
Fine! She paid the taxes; she owns it.

1768
01:38:49,034 --> 01:38:52,026
I told you I didn't want anything to do with that place.

1769
01:38:52,103 --> 01:38:53,968
This isn't about what you want.

1770
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:56,030
I don't give a damn what you want.

1771
01:38:56,107 --> 01:38:58,735
This is about need.

1772
01:38:58,810 --> 01:39:03,144
Clive Jr.'s gone; he's not coming back.

1773
01:39:04,582 --> 01:39:07,244
Now, this is the favor:

1774
01:39:07,319 --> 01:39:11,256
When she tells you...

1775
01:39:11,256 --> 01:39:12,985
be grateful.

1776
01:39:13,058 --> 01:39:15,959
Make her feel good.

1777
01:39:16,027 --> 01:39:19,758
Is that too much to ask?

1778
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:25,292
Sully, either you do this, or... I'm off of you for life.

1779
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:28,703
I mean it.

1780
01:39:28,773 --> 01:39:30,138
Dad?

1781
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:32,175
Dad.

1782
01:39:33,411 --> 01:39:34,935
Yeah?

1783
01:39:35,013 --> 01:39:38,710
Could you and Rub spare me for a couple days?

1784
01:39:38,783 --> 01:39:41,217
Well, Rub sure could.

1785
01:39:41,319 --> 01:39:43,082
How 'bout you?

1786
01:39:43,154 --> 01:39:45,122
Okay.

1787
01:39:48,626 --> 01:39:52,619
Uh... could be more than a couple days.

1788
01:39:52,697 --> 01:39:54,130
Well, you run into problems,

1789
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:56,326
just think what I would do, and then...

1790
01:39:56,401 --> 01:39:57,800
Do the opposite.

1791
01:39:57,869 --> 01:39:59,359
I'll remember that.

1792
01:39:59,437 --> 01:40:03,066
Oh. Almost forgot.

1793
01:40:03,141 --> 01:40:04,665
What's that?

1794
01:40:04,743 --> 01:40:07,445
Here. What do you think it is?

1795
01:40:07,445 --> 01:40:09,936
It's a trifecta ticket.

1796
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:18,345
The trifecta ticket?

1797
01:40:18,423 --> 01:40:20,721
The one that hit?

1798
01:40:24,863 --> 01:40:25,989
How much?

1799
01:40:26,064 --> 01:40:28,430
5,800 bucks.

1800
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,133
And you bet it?

1801
01:40:30,201 --> 01:40:32,863
You told me to, remember?

1802
01:40:32,937 --> 01:40:34,666
Right before you went to jail.

1803
01:40:38,143 --> 01:40:39,303
Oh, wow.

1804
01:40:39,377 --> 01:40:40,844
How about that?

1805
01:40:40,912 --> 01:40:45,076
Intelligence, hard work and good looks finally pay off.

1806
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:47,812
And to think we were here to see it.

1807
01:40:49,220 --> 01:40:51,654
Wow.

1808
01:42:24,782 --> 01:42:27,842
Hey, try anything and you'll regret it!

1809
01:42:39,063 --> 01:42:43,261
Oh, no... not a chance.

1810
01:43:15,433 --> 01:43:16,798
Oh...!

1811
01:43:18,336 --> 01:43:20,031
Who are you?

1812
01:43:29,013 --> 01:43:33,279
I fixed the railing on the porch.

1813
01:43:36,454 --> 01:43:38,979
Can I come in and pull my boots off?

1814
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:41,217
Of course, Donald.

1815
01:43:45,063 --> 01:43:48,999
Looks like you're the only one in town who'll have me.

1816
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:52,796
I hope you didn't... rent my room out from underneath me.

1817
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:55,236
Not yet.

1818
01:43:55,306 --> 01:43:58,400
By the way, what's your policy on pets?

1819
01:44:01,212 --> 01:44:02,372
I'm not sure.

1820
01:44:02,447 --> 01:44:06,747
Well... we'll come up with something.

1821
01:44:10,054 --> 01:44:11,419
I'm going to have a cup of tea.

1822
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:12,383
Would you like one?

1823
01:44:12,457 --> 01:44:15,324
No. Not now, not ever.

1824
01:44:20,264 --> 01:44:22,323
I'm sorry about Clive Jr.

1825
01:44:24,035 --> 01:44:26,765
Thank you, Donald.

1826
01:44:26,838 --> 01:44:30,108
I keep thinking I failed him in some way.

1827
01:44:30,108 --> 01:44:32,008
At least you raised him.

1828
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:36,240
That's more than I can say.

1829
01:44:36,314 --> 01:44:40,341
There's a rumor around town that you did a good deed.

1830
01:44:40,418 --> 01:44:44,286
You stuck your nose where it didn't belong.

1831
01:44:44,355 --> 01:44:47,324
I know it.

1832
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:49,860
I'm an old woman, though; I'm entitled.

1833
01:44:56,868 --> 01:44:58,733
Well, you're forgiven.

1834
01:44:58,803 --> 01:45:01,363
Thank you.

1835
01:45:03,041 --> 01:45:06,238
Are you sure I can't interest you in a cup of tea?

1836
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:09,370
No, and how many times do I have to tell you?

1837
01:45:09,447 --> 01:45:11,779
Other people change their minds occasionally.

1838
01:45:11,849 --> 01:45:15,216
I keep thinking you might.

1839
01:45:15,286 --> 01:45:18,016
You do?

1840
01:45:20,425 --> 01:45:22,950
Huh.

1841
01:45:47,852 --> 01:45:50,719
You may as well come in, too.
