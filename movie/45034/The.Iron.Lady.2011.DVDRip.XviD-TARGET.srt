1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,103
Noppes

2
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:21,106
The Iron Lady 2011 Cam XviD Feel-Free

3
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,513
One forty-nine please.

4
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:42,802
How much is the milk?

5
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,500
Forty-nine pence.

6
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:51,496
Thank you.

7
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:59,439
Thank you.

8
00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:39,108
Too much. Much too much butter.
- I like butter.

9
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:49,080
Milk’s gone up.

10
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,886
49p a pint.

11
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,913
Good grief! We’ll have to economise.

12
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:01,077
I suppose we could always sell the car.
Or take in paying guests!

13
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:07,429
Watch out. She’s on the prowl.

14
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:16,427
Eat your egg.

15
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,180
Goodness! There you are.

16
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:25,070
Yes.
Here we are.

17
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,159
I don’t understand how it happened,

18
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,470
how could she possibly have got out?
It’s very very important -

19
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,612
Please just make it really clear.

20
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:47,089
Who’s on after you?

21
00:03:47,090 --> 00:04:03,128
xxx?

22
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,047
Beautiful day.
Oh, you’ve made a start.

23
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,505
Carol’s coming soon,
I’ll get some bags.

24
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:26,053
Anything you want to go to Mark,
I’ll bring up a suitcase for it.

25
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:37,082
No no no no. The grey.

26
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,206
You sure?

27
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:51,611
Yes.
...Definitely the grey.

28
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,942
Righty ho.

29
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:56,711
Boss knows best.

30
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,700
Don’t let her take my paper away.

31
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,072
Oh, I haven’t had a chance to look
at that yet, dear.

32
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,424
Sorry.

33
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,358
Atta-girl.

34
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:19,758
Damn.

35
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,940
Blot it...Blot it..

36
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,478
pardon.

37
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,781
Now look what you’ve done.

38
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:41,302
Are they to keep the loonies
out or you in?

39
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,050
I’ll be off then.

40
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:50,831
Wear your scarf.
There’s a chill out there.

41
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:56,564
Good morning Lady Thatcher.

42
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:59,276
Are you alright?
How are you feeling?

43
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,934
I’m fine, thank you Susie.

44
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:05,671
I’ve just been reading about the bombings.

45
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,588
Yes. Frightful.

46
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:16,629
Sorry.

47
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,681
These are the books for you to sign.

48
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:26,045
I brought as many as I could find.
Shall we go through your appointments?

49
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:29,835
We said we’d go through them today.

50
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:33,717
Yes, of course, dear. Today.

51
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,956
The invitation has come from Downing Street
for the unveiling of your portrait.

52
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:40,740
I’ll put it on the mantelpiece, and there’s
an invitation from Lord Armstrong for

53
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,325
lunch on the first Friday of next month.

54
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,638
I said no because you’ve got a concert
that afternoon but if you’d like to...

55
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,303
It looks like a very interesting programme.

56
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:51,987
What are they playing?

57
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:59,252
I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein.

58
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,588
Silly man.

59
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:38,344
He hasn’t got his scarf on.

60
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:21,020
Did someone cover the butter?

61
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:23,842
I’ll go.

62
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,420
Leave it. Margaret-

63
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:34,708
Good girl.

64
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:41,990
Tomorrow, no matter what they do,
it’ll be business as usual.

65
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,889
Two of the small beef, Mr. Roberts.

66
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:53,542
What is the life blood of any community?
It’s business...

67
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,451
Not just big business but small
businesses, like mine.

68
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:57,845
Margaret! CUPS!

69
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,972
We on this island are strong.
We’re self-reliant.

70
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:04,655
Sometimes
we’re plain bloody minded.

71
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,344
But we also believe in helping
each other.

72
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,243
And I don’t mean by
state hand-outs...

73
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,176
Margaret, do you want to come to
the pictures?

74
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:13,306
She can’t come, she’s got to study.

75
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:14,836
Miss Hoity Toity!

76
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:19,323
Never run with the crowd, Margaret.
Go your own way.

77
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,063
xxxOpen it then.

78
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:33,098
I’ve got a place at Oxford.

79
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,635
Don’t let me down Margaret.

80
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:42,646
Mother?

81
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,366
My hands are still damp.

82
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,920
Margaret!CUPS!

83
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,365
They’re talking about you again.

84
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,436
What time is it?

85
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:31,230
Sun’s not quite over the yard arm.
Time for tea.

86
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,598
What have you got on your head?

87
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:44,575
Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger
it, it’s Friday, why not fancy dress?

88
00:10:44,873 --> 00:10:46,495
You look ridiculous.

89
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,650
Bosslady no like?

90
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:51,392
No, Denis, Bosslady no like.

91
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:19,405
Can I suggest you remove the
sticker from the back of your car.

92
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,703
xxx

93
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:23,704
Well then take the sticker off!
I call that false advertising!

94
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:25,750
xxx
- I would say keep the change...

95
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,955
but there isn’t any change.

96
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,989
Hello June, any news? I’ve brought
every bag I could find.

97
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:37,720
xxx

98
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:38,565
Hello Ma.

99
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,798
Bloody taxi driver.
Wouldn’t take my card.

100
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:46,609
I said don’t have a sticker saying you
take Visa and then insist on cash.

101
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,829
Can you believe it? I was rummaging around
the bottom of my bag. He didn’t get a tip.

102
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:59,711
I didn’t know that you were
dropping by today, dear.

103
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,619
Yes, you said yesterday...
You wanted to make a start on Dad’s things.

104
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,671
The cupboards?
Then I can help you dress.

105
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,993
You’ve got Michael and-

106
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:11,029
Jaqueline...
Coming for dinner tonight.

107
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,486
Of course.

108
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,526
We’re having halibut.

109
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:27,081
Oh God. Isn’t it terrible?
They think it’s Al Quaida -

110
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:30,206
xxx

111
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:40,574
It’ll be fine. Come on, get your head down,
it’s ten to three, for God’s sake.

112
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:43,371
At ten to three this morning
an explosion...

113
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:46,282
extensively damaged
the Grand Hotel in Brighton

114
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,920
scene of the Conservative
Party conference.

115
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,121
Where the Prime Minister and a
number of her cabinet were staying.

116
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:53,814
They escaped unhurt -

117
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,358
Five people have died, many others
are injured, some critically.

118
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:01,248
The IRA have claimed responsibility.

119
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,311
We must release a statement,
offering our condolences.

120
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,812
I’m sure they’ve already-

121
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,154
We must never, ever, ever give in
to terrorists.

122
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,249
Good moring dear.

123
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:26,125
Now ma, are we going long or just
below the knee tonight?

124
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,641
Oh, below the knee I should think.

125
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:37,796
No! Don’t move those. I haven’t
finished sorting them.

126
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,534
I hear you went out today...

127
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,590
You mustn’t go out on your own Mummy.
We’ve talked about that.

128
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,147
There was no milk.

129
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,267
Call Robert he’ll get it for you
if June’s not up-

130
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,558
I am not for the knackers yet.

131
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,194
Now take it easy, Margaret.

132
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,735
No one is saying that.

133
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:11,629
If I can’t go out to buy a pint of milk
then what is the world coming to.

134
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:12,630
Really Carol...

135
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,515
please don’t fuss about it.

136
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:21,315
You’ve always been like this,
fuss fuss fuss.

137
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:25,253
You must find something better
to do with your time.

138
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,062
It’s most unattractive in a woman.

139
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,859
When I was your age...

140
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:36,272
the last thing I wanted to do
was fuss around my mother.

141
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:40,476
Four down, 9 letters.

142
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,380
Something b something t
something n...

143
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,153
something something somthing...
Refusal to change course-

144
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:49,985
Obstinate.

145
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,804
What?

146
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:56,377
Pearls.
I’ll wear the pearls.

147
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:13,849
There they are.
My little twins.

148
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,359
Thank you, dear.

149
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:24,561
It’s nearly all familiar faces, William,
Michael and his lovely wife-

150
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:25,554
Jacqueline.

151
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:31,421
And then there’s Peter, James R
and James T and that very nice man-

152
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,878
Yes-
we met last year.

153
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:34,896
Yes I remember-

154
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:37,762
I think he’s bringing his new lady
friend just to mix it up a bit.

155
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:41,256
We’re rather short on women - but
I’m sure we’ll manage-

156
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,856
I’ve always preferred the company
of men-

157
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,004
Ma?

158
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:58,600
Ah, Miss Roberts.

159
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:02,498
Hoping to be chosen as
our candidate for parliament.

160
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:06,851
Well I don’t like coalitions,
never have...

161
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:19,427
Start on the outside
and work your way in.

162
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:23,436
Attlee has his sights set on
the steel industry, you mark my words.

163
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,690
They’ll be nationalizing the
bloody air next.

164
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:28,541
Yes, hold your breath, sir, that’s
government property!

165
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:33,110
So was your father a political
man, too, Miss Roberts?

166
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:38,088
Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of
Grantham.

167
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:41,779
And a grocer as well!

168
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:42,720
Yes.

169
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:49,210
And did you help, in the... shop?
- Oh, yes. It was a family business.

170
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:52,243
A very good starting point for the
political life, I’m sure.

171
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,655
That and a degree from Oxford.

172
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,288
Whisky.

173
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:15,800
What I do think is that a man should be
encouraged to stand on his own two feet.

174
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:21,051
Yes we help people of course we help people.
But for those that can do...

175
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,393
they must just get up and do.

176
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:27,577
And if something’s wrong,
they shouldn’t just whine about it...

177
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:32,080
they should get in there and DO
something about it, change things.

178
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:35,319
With all due respect, Miss Roberts,
what may have served in Grantham-

179
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,191
Can serve very well for the people
of Dartford too.

180
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:38,924
Really?

181
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:43,005
I know much more than those who
have never lived on a limited income.

182
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,220
Just like the man or woman on the street,
when I am short one week...

183
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,827
I have to make economies the next.

184
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:53,088
Nothing like a slice of fiscal
responsibility.

185
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:58,907
A man might call it fiscal responsibility,
a woman might call it good housekeeping.

186
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,335
I’m not sure...

187
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,680
a home economics lesson
is quite what...

188
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,969
the Dartford constituents need.

189
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,077
They see industry being nationalized...

190
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:13,737
the unions on the up,
the pound on the slide...

191
00:18:14,082 --> 00:18:18,329
whoever can sort that lot out,
he’s my man.

192
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,388
Or woman?

193
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,603
Ladies shall we?

194
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,908
Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.

195
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,923
Well. That’s told us!

196
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:56,134
So, Margaret, how would you have
dealt with this if you’d been Prime Minister?

197
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,643
Where?

198
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:03,021
The bombings, mummy. Today?

199
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,180
We were just talking about them?

200
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:13,817
No, uhm, yes -
we have always lived alongside evil.

201
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:18,122
But it has never been so patient,

202
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:24,856
so avid for carnage, so eager to
carry innocents with it into oblivion.

203
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,647
xxxSo, would you -

204
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:31,982
Western civilization must root out
this evil, wherever it hides,

205
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:37,386
or she risks defeat at the hands
of global terror in a nuclear age.

206
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:38,543
Unimaginable!

207
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,622
The Prime Minister gave a very
good statement I thought.

208
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,623
Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.

209
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:50,364
xxxYou don’t mind if I sit down...

210
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,348
I heard you speak at conference
in Brighton in 1984

211
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,790
just after the IRA bombed
the Grand Hotel.

212
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:02,201
You were remarkable.

213
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,861
I hope you appreciate what an inspiration
you have been for women like myself.

214
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:13,028
It used to be about trying
to do something.

215
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:18,359
Now its about trying to be someone.

216
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,752
Well anyway, I...thank you.

217
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:29,272
Good night, Lady Th...
- Good night to you.

218
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,803
OK...hold on to me...

219
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:00,340
Can you do the clasp, I can’t quite -

220
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,517
Thank you.

221
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:07,483
You’ve got an eyelash.

222
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:10,496
Make a wish.

223
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:24,700
I spoke to Doctor Michael today-

224
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,967
He is very good and very expensive-

225
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,274
...I know you’re not due to see
him for another month

226
00:21:34,222 --> 00:21:37,434
but I’ve spoken to him and he can fit
you in tomorrow.

227
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:40,778
Just for a check up.

228
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:44,505
Ma please-

229
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:48,200
What does Mark think about it?

230
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:50,367
Mark?

231
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:57,293
Yes. Tell him to come up. I want
to talk to him about it.

232
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,899
Mark’s with Sarah and the
children.

233
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:09,948
Well tell him to come up
and see me after he’s...

234
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:12,478
kissed them good night,
would you Carol darling?

235
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:32,653
He’s not here Mummy.

236
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:37,405
Mark lives in South Africa...

237
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,390
you are not Prime Minister anymore...

238
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:51,893
and Dad is...
Dad is dead-

239
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,208
You look exhausted, dear.

240
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:11,303
You really must try to get some sleep.

241
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:19,362
Taxis'll be few and far
between at this hour...

242
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,559
Righty-ho. Night night Ma.
Sleep well.

243
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,694
Good night, dear.

244
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:21,171
Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts
lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today,

245
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,983
but she has put new life into the Dartford
Conservative Association.

246
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:27,793
Winning candidate Mr Dodds
had better watch out,

247
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:30,128
this bright young woman
is on his tail.

248
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:41,998
Eat!

249
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,954
Disaster.

250
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:46,623
Hang on...Hang on...

251
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,236
xxx

252
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,863
You shaved thousands off their majority.
You did splendidly.

253
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,942
Not splendidly enough.

254
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:01,896
Ah I see. Self pity.

255
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:05,720
No one is saying you don’t need
a safe seat.

256
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,454
You deserve a safe seat.

257
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:12,524
But it does not come unless
you learn to play the game a little.

258
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,771
What game?

259
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:16,075
You are a grocer’s daughter-

260
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:18,866
And proud of being.
- in their eyes.

261
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,033
A single grocer’s daughter.

262
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:27,792
But if you were to become the wife
of a moderately successful businessman-

263
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:28,887
You’d get to parliament,

264
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:31,903
and I’d get to be
the happiest man in...

265
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,098
in wherever they select you.

266
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:51,290
Margaret, will you marry me?

267
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:56,973
Well?

268
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:05,175
Yes. Yes!

269
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:08,935
What?

270
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,768
I love you so much but...

271
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,770
I will never be one of those women Denis-

272
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:18,666
who stays silent and pretty on the arm
of her husband.

273
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:24,140
Or remote and alone in the kitchen
doing the washing up for that matter.

274
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:25,871
We’ll get a help for that.
- No...

275
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:30,510
one’s life must matter, Denis.

276
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:34,977
Beyond the cooking and
the cleaning and the children,

277
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,854
one’s life must mean more than that-

278
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:42,060
I cannot die washing up a tea cup.

279
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,294
I mean it Denis,

280
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,780
say you understand.

281
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,957
That’s why I want to marry you, my dear.

282
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:11,558
Now eat.

283
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:18,919
There they are, my little twins.

284
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:37,919
Cornwall, wasn’t it?
Bloody hell...

285
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,507
Look at ‘em, little imps.

286
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,314
You never really got golf, did you?

287
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,307
You look happy.

288
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,875
Yes, I do, don’t I?
You’re drinking too much.

289
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:02,400
Whatcha doing?

290
00:29:02,435 --> 00:29:04,246
Not like you. Looking back.

291
00:29:04,925 --> 00:29:08,373
Don’t want to dig around too deep,
M. Don’t know what you might find.

292
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,321
You can rewind it, but you can’t
change it.

293
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:17,966
They grow up so fast.

294
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:58,839
Mr Eric Deakins,

295
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:02,983
Labour...
13,437...

296
00:30:08,127 --> 00:30:13,966
Mr xxxx lib...
12,260

297
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,704
Mrs Marg.. Thatcher

298
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:25,334
con... 29,697

299
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:31,188
xxx

300
00:30:31,993 --> 00:30:34,269
Mrs Marg.. Thatcher.

301
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,710
xxx... Please.

302
00:30:45,711 --> 00:31:00,547
xxx

303
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:24,260
Mrs Thatcher!

304
00:32:26,601 --> 00:32:32,191
Mrs Thatcher! Airey Neave.
Welcome to the madhouse. Follow me.

305
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:43,769
Welcome... xxx

306
00:32:58,035 --> 00:32:59,971
Order

307
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:03,680
The Right Honourable Lady the
Secretary of State for Education.

308
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:11,370
The right honourable gentleman knows
that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!

309
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,494
Because...

310
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:24,070
his union paymasters have called a
strike deliberately to cripple our economy.

311
00:33:26,939 --> 00:33:32,842
Teachers cannot teach when there is no
heating, no lighting in their classrooms.

312
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,988
And I ask the honourable gentleman,
whose fault is that?

313
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,976
Me thinks the Right Honourable
lady doth screech to much.

314
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,126
If she wants us to take her seriously
she must learn to calm down!

315
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:03,455
If the right honorable gentleman could
perhaps attend more closely to...

316
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,642
What I am saying,
rather than HOW I am saying it,

317
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:13,105
he may receive a valuable
education in spite of himself!

318
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:19,555
Why has this Conservative
government failed?

319
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:26,109
Why has it forced so many
in the public sector into

320
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:30,377
taking strike action
to save their own jobs?

321
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:35,939
Minister...

322
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:42,249
the breakdown of essential public
services in transport, electricity...

323
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:46,262
sanitation is not the fault
of the trades unions...

324
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:50,716
but of this Conservative government

325
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:53,722
in which you so shamefully serve!

326
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,046
So these power cuts will continue
unless we can reach a compromise.

327
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:15,797
The miners are asking for
a 35% increase in wages.

328
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:18,193
Obviously we can’t go
anywhere near that.

329
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:21,660
The unions are not our enemies
and never have been.

330
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:25,727
We want- and have always wanted
the broadest consensus…

331
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:29,521
I’m sure we are all in agreement
that we must do nothing...

332
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:32,337
for the moment that will further
inflame the current situation.

333
00:35:32,372 --> 00:35:33,782
Hear hear, Prime Minister.

334
00:35:33,817 --> 00:35:36,531
- the fact of the matter is,
it’s absolutely crucial...

335
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:39,908
that we are seen by the public
to be acting as conciliators...

336
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:42,707
and not aggressors.
- Yes.

337
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,912
Yes, Education Secretary.

338
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:49,425
Yes, Prime Minister.

339
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,944
With the Miners’ leader calling
today for the army to mutiny...

340
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,971
in support of the strikes, this seems
the wrong time for conciliation.

341
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,540
Be patient. They’ll come back
on in a minute.

342
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:08,573
xxx

343
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:11,346
Thank you, Margaret.

344
00:36:13,357 --> 00:36:16,155
Your thoughts are duly noted.

345
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:25,394
We on this island are strong.

346
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:30,923
We’re self-reliant. Napoleon
called us a nation of shopkeepers.

347
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:34,148
He meant it as an insult
but to me it’s a compliment.

348
00:36:34,183 --> 00:36:37,793
That’s why he couldn’t beat us,
and that’s why Hitler can’t beat us.

349
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:45,258
We Conservatives believe in giving people
the freedom and opportunity to...

350
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:48,521
fulfil their own potential,
especially the young.

351
00:36:48,556 --> 00:36:50,443
There’s no good in pretending
we’re all equal...

352
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:52,935
we’re not all the same, never
have been, never will be.

353
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:59,525
We should encourage our children to
aspire to achieve more than we have...

354
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,495
for our children today will
be the leaders of tomorrow.

355
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,994
It’s 1974 and you’d think
it was WWII.

356
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,343
Blackouts, no petrol.
It’s a mess.

357
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:16,119
Heath should resign now and make way
for someone who’s not afraid to tackle the unions.

358
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:18,254
I swear, it’s all gone completely
out of my head.

359
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:22,270
My driving instructor thinks I should pass
but I feel as if I’ve hardly had any lessons.

360
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:25,679
Ridiculous isn’t it?
Maybe third time lucky.

361
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:26,575
Right.

362
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:31,959
The only thing you should remember is
that everyone else is either reckless or inept.

363
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:33,734
And often both.

364
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,934
One must be brave if one is to
take the wheel-

365
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:38,322
Right-o.

366
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,755
Move over... Move to your right a
little bit...

367
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,167
But if I move to the right aren’t
I on the wrong side of the road?

368
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:47,379
Well he’s in the way!
- To the right. Move to the right!

369
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:52,576
So sorry! Terribly sorry!

370
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:00,462
Hey, look at me, driving!

371
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:04,285
Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I
really feel I’ve got a handle on it now.

372
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,630
You should have seen us, Pa.

373
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:09,580
Have you been trying to make
breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis!

374
00:38:09,615 --> 00:38:11,446
I can boil a bloody egg.

375
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:12,493
Mummy took me for a test drive -

376
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:14,787
We went absolutely everywhere.
All over the place -

377
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:18,257
I’ve decided. I’m going to run.

378
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,484
What for?

379
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:24,528
I’m going to run for Leader of the Party.

380
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,834
Silly me!
- Good luck!

381
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:36,027
All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson,
it was all about my mother, just for a change!

382
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:37,576
What’s she on about?

383
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,539
It’s her driving test this morning!
- Oh, right. Of course.

384
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:44,216
Are you saying you want to be
Prime Minister?

385
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:49,950
What I’m saying is that someone
must force the point,

386
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:54,193
say the unsayable. None of these
men have the guts.

387
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:58,696
The Prime Minister has been very
loyal to you, MT.

388
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:01,396
But he’s weak, and he’s
weakened the party.

389
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,681
One must know when to go.
You’re shaking.

390
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,290
Let... xxx
- I can do it!

391
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:10,971
Goodness me!

392
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,143
What is the matter
with everyone this morning?

393
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:17,359
I’ve told you what the matter is.

394
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:21,046
The business is a bit rocky at the moment
and the Doctor thinks I need a rest.

395
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:22,571
And do you need a rest?

396
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:26,972
We both know...

397
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,923
that it’s highly unlikely that I
would ever be elected leader,

398
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:33,971
But I will run. I will run.

399
00:39:34,006 --> 00:39:36,045
Just to nip at their heels and make...

400
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,733
them reaffirm the principles on which
the Conservative Party must stand.

401
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:46,021
There’s so much to do.

402
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:49,868
You’re insufferable, Margaret,
do you know that?

403
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:57,098
Denis, you married someone who is committed
to public service, you knew that.

404
00:39:58,392 --> 00:40:01,708
And it is my duty...
- Don’t call it duty.

405
00:40:01,743 --> 00:40:04,714
It’s ambition which has got
you this far. Ambition.

406
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:09,139
And the rest of us, me, the children,
we can all go to hell!

407
00:40:10,872 --> 00:40:13,248
Don’t worry about me,
I’ll be fine!

408
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:15,647
Where did you go?

409
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,682
South Africa.
- Yes.Yes.

410
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,324
How many days passed before
you realized I was gone?

411
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,096
Probably had to ask the cleaning
woman where I was.

412
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:28,073
When did I lose track of everyone?

413
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:32,073
Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT.

414
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:35,880
Mrs Thatcher I understand you
recently visited the United States of America.

415
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:41,556
What was it you took away from that visit
which may be of value here in Great Britain?

416
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:43,531
Oh that’s rather easy
to answer, actually.

417
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,299
They are unafraid of success.

418
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:53,677
We in Great Britain and in Europe
are formed mainly by our history.

419
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:57,673
They on the other hand are
formed by their philosophy.

420
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,347
Not by what has been,
but by what can be.

421
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:06,793
Oh, we have a great deal that we
can learn from them, yes. Oh yes!

422
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,060
For a start, that hat
has got to go.

423
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:22,345
And the pearls.

424
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,348
In fact I think all hats may have to go.

425
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,413
You look and sound like...

426
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:33,850
a privileged Conservative wife
and we’ve already got her vote.

427
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:35,797
You’ve got lovely hair...

428
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:39,901
but we need to do something with it
to make it more, Important.

429
00:41:39,936 --> 00:41:41,592
Yes. Give it more impact.

430
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:47,250
But the main thing is your voice.
Its too high. It has no authority.

431
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:50,971
Me thinks the Lady doth screech too much

432
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:54,884
People don’t want to be harangued
by a woman or hectored.

433
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:57,657
Persuaded yes.
That ‘oh yes’...

434
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,442
at the end of the interview,

435
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:02,087
that’s authoritative,
that’s the voice of a leader.

436
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:07,814
It’s all very well to talk about
changing my voice, Mr Reece,

437
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:12,457
but for some of my colleagues to
imagine me as their leader...

438
00:42:13,315 --> 00:42:14,850
would be like imagining,

439
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:18,666
I don’t know, being led into
battle by their chambermaid.

440
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:21,487
It’s my background, and my sex.

441
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:25,551
No matter how I’ve tried,
and I have tried...

442
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:30,088
to fit in, xxx
I will never be truly one of them.

443
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:33,342
If I may say so - I think that’s
your trump card.

444
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:36,978
You’re flying in the face of everything
the Tories have been thus far.

445
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,799
It’s really very exciting.

446
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:44,228
One simply has to maximise
your appeal...

447
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:46,812
bring out all your qualities...

448
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:51,029
and make you look, and sound,
like the leader that you could be.

449
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,173
You’ve got it in you to go the
whole distance.

450
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:54,012
Absolutely.

451
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:58,291
Prime Minister?!

452
00:42:59,641 --> 00:43:05,383
Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain?

453
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:11,647
There will be no female Prime Minister
here, not in my lifetime.

454
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:12,938
No.

455
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:18,245
And I told Airey, I don’t expect
to win the leadership, but I...

456
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:22,211
am going to run.
Just to shake up the party.

457
00:43:22,246 --> 00:43:24,055
Respectfully, Margaret,

458
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:28,050
I disagree.
If you want to change this party,

459
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:31,236
lead it. If you want to change
the country, lead it.

460
00:43:31,271 --> 00:43:35,822
What we’re talking about here
today is surface. What’s crucial...

461
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:39,339
is that you hold your course, and
stay true to who you are.

462
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:41,751
Never be anything other
than yourself.

463
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,638
Leave us to do the rest.

464
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,948
Gentlemen, I am in your hands.

465
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,296
I may be persuaded to
surrender the hat.

466
00:43:58,331 --> 00:44:03,195
But the pearls were a gift from my
husband on the birth of our twins...

467
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:09,203
and they are absolutely
non-negotiable.

468
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:18,024
Good, I think we can loose
the handbag, Mrs Thatcher.

469
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:21,600
Hands down the sides...

470
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,491
And...bring it down.

471
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,652
Because this isn’t really about
the voice, it’s about belief...

472
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:33,046
A nice deep breath.

473
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,917
xxx hands

474
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:41,473
If you’re calling Mr Thatcher,
how would you do that?

475
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:42,315
Denis.

476
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,026
Yes, I want more authority,
I want conviction, I want...

477
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:48,451
That’s right, one more time,
deep breath -

478
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:49,428
Denis.

479
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,823
Yes MT!

480
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:57,727
You are the backbone
of our nation!

481
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:00,779
Small firms like Loveday’s Ice Cream.

482
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:02,742
How are you?
So nice to meet you ladies.

483
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:06,080
I’ll just have a small one,
because I’m watching my figure.

484
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:08,854
That’s for you young man!

485
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:13,922
I passionately believe it’s the growth
of small businesses into larger ones...

486
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:16,861
that is critical for
Britain’s future.

487
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:20,242
It has to be something icy on
a stick for Denis.

488
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:21,614
That’s the only way...

489
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:27,043
we will produce jobs,
real jobs, jobs that sustain.

490
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:33,698
The Trade Union Movement was
founded to protect workers.

491
00:45:33,733 --> 00:45:38,591
Now it persecutes them.
It stops them from working.

492
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:42,416
It is killing jobs and it is bringing
this country to its knees.

493
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:43,614
I say enough.

494
00:45:43,649 --> 00:45:48,275
It’s time to get up.
It’s time to go to work.

495
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:53,491
It’s time to put the Great
back into Great Britain!

496
00:45:54,023 --> 00:46:06,932
xxx

497
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:08,222
Give ‘em hell!

498
00:46:08,257 --> 00:46:12,280
You look magnificent.
Next stop Prime Minister.

499
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:13,462
Let go.

500
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:16,978
The leader of the Conservative
Party, Margaret Thatcher!

501
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:48,468
Good night Margaret.
My money’s on the filly to win!

502
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:51,647
Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight.

503
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:06,390
No. No, no! Airey!

504
00:47:13,776 --> 00:47:17,225
The Irish National Liberation Army
has claimed responsibility for the...

505
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,074
death of Airey Neave, Margaret
Thatcher’s spokesman on Northern Ireland.

506
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,151
<i>If you want to change the party,
lead it.</i>

507
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,990
<i>If you want to change
the country, lead it.</i>

508
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:43,186
<i>You’ve got it in you to
go the whole distance!</i>

509
00:47:46,648 --> 00:47:52,581
Now, as the test draws near,
I ask your help.

510
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:57,535
That together we can shake off
the shackles of socialism

511
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:02,219
and restore to greatness
this country that we love.

512
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:06,607
And the only way is for the
Conservative Party to win!

513
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:11,137
xxx

514
00:48:35,005 --> 00:48:37,792
It’s Friday the 4th of May,
an historic day for Britain,

515
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:41,618
a Conservative government led by
Mrs. Thatcher is set to lead -

516
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:47,863
Mrs Ghandi in India, but never in the West
has there been a woman Prime Minister.

517
00:48:47,898 --> 00:48:50,197
The place that she has secured
in British history, as...

518
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:52,885
the first woman ever to be invited
to form a government.

519
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,258
The bonus of one of the most
famous addresses in the world,

520
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:56,778
Number 10 Downing Street.

521
00:48:56,813 --> 00:48:59,855
This is it, steady the buffs old girl.

522
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,779
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

523
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:14,294
I should just like to say...

524
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:17,835
that I take very seriously
the trust...

525
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,405
the British people placed
in me today...

526
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:26,117
and I will work hard every day to
live up to that responsibility.

527
00:49:26,152 --> 00:49:30,499
And now, I should like to share
with you a prayer...

528
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,188
of St Francis of Assisi:

529
00:49:35,128 --> 00:49:39,721
''Where there is discord may
we bring harmony...

530
00:49:39,756 --> 00:49:44,533
Where there is error may we bring truth...

531
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:48,815
Where there is doubt
may we bring faith...

532
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:53,724
Where there is despair
may we bring hope''

533
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:06,975
Shoulders back, tummies in!

534
00:50:09,252 --> 00:50:10,722
Oh. Thank you, Michael.

535
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,096
Two, one.

536
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:40,343
I’m perfectly healthy. There’s no
need for any of this.

537
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:43,330
Just let them look under
the bonnet, MT.

538
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,151
Check everything is hunky dory.

539
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:50,897
Really it’s becoming quite tiresome.

540
00:50:50,932 --> 00:50:52,083
What is?
- You.

541
00:50:53,248 --> 00:50:56,774
I was on my own for
twenty four years...

542
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:02,370
before I met you and I can manage
perfectly well without you now.

543
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:08,565
So will you please go away
and stop bothering me.

544
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,130
Just look straight at me,
straight ahead, that’s it.

545
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:15,541
Are you noticing night sweats?
- No.

546
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,210
Hallucinations?

547
00:51:19,336 --> 00:51:20,128
No.

548
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,243
Sleep?

549
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:27,512
Yes, I sleep.
Four, five hours a night.

550
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:29,481
So you wake early?

551
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:33,062
And I stay up late.
I always have.

552
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:35,856
We just want to keep abreast
of it thats all.

553
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,227
Yes. Of course.

554
00:51:38,761 --> 00:51:40,791
Grief is a very natural state.

555
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:45,947
My husband has been gone
for years. Cancer.

556
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,426
Carol says you’ve decided to let
his things go. Probably a good thing.

557
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:53,419
Yes. It was my idea.
To Oxfam.

558
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:57,688
Perfectly good stuff. People can
use these things.

559
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:04,673
Still it must be a bit disorientating.
You are bound to be feeling.

560
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:05,631
What?

561
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:09,958
What am I
‘bound to be feeling’?

562
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:14,553
People don’t ‘think’ any more.

563
00:52:14,588 --> 00:52:17,128
They ‘feel’.
‘How are you feeling?’

564
00:52:17,163 --> 00:52:19,676
‘Oh I don’t feel comfortable
with that’

565
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:22,393
‘Oh, I’m so sorry but we,
the group were feeling...’

566
00:52:23,164 --> 00:52:26,421
D’you know, one of the
great problems of our age...

567
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:28,976
is that we are governed
by people who care...

568
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:33,658
more about feelings
than thoughts and ideas.

569
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:38,153
Now thoughts and ideas.
That interests me.

570
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,345
Ask me what I am thinking-

571
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,395
What are you thinking, Margaret?

572
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:47,652
Watch your thoughts,
for they become words.

573
00:52:47,687 --> 00:52:50,802
Watch your words,
for they become actions.

574
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:56,417
Watch your actions,
for they become habits.

575
00:52:56,452 --> 00:53:00,679
Watch your habits, for
they become your character.

576
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:04,733
And watch your character,
for it becomes your destiny.

577
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,714
What we think, we become.

578
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:10,278
My father always said that.

579
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,201
And I think I am fine.

580
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,187
But I do so appreciate
your kind concern.

581
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:31,657
Oh, do please answer that.

582
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:33,913
It might be someone who needs you.

583
00:53:37,473 --> 00:53:39,234
I’ll give Carol a quick
ring, let her...

584
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:42,381
know we’re back, then I’ll put
your electric blanket on.

585
00:53:44,312 --> 00:53:46,647
Steady, steady, steady!

586
00:53:48,785 --> 00:53:51,258
Damn.
Fore!

587
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:55,085
What about that medicine man, eh?

588
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,456
Ah. Cold supper.

589
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:00,938
Standards are slipping Margaret.

590
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,898
Well you really gave it to that
quack didn’t you, darling?

591
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:08,813
Just like the old days!
Hallucinations my eye!

592
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:10,285
How dare he?

593
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,455
But then you give us all the run
around, don’t you?

594
00:54:13,798 --> 00:54:18,366
I know you can hear me, sweetheart,
so there’s no use pretending you can’t.

595
00:54:20,004 --> 00:54:22,505
Enough. Denis, enough!

596
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:24,379
Dismissed!

597
00:54:32,343 --> 00:54:34,666
She does it in the end.
Kills him-

598
00:54:37,168 --> 00:54:39,621
I don’t know why you’re
being so scratchy.

599
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:42,251
It’s not as if you’ve got anyone
else to talk to.

600
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:46,040
When the Himalayan peasant meets
the he-bear in his pride -

601
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,798
You know, it’s a marvel to me that you
can still quote huge chunks of Kipling...

602
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,379
but try remembering the name
of that woman who’s...

603
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,853
just made you that
godawful cold collation.

604
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:56,399
No?

605
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:58,285
Come on.
You can do it.

606
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,629
Month of the year.

607
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,836
One syllable.
Rhymes with moon.

608
00:55:04,436 --> 00:55:06,799
June.
- June! Bingo.

609
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:08,334
Knew you’d get
there in the end.

610
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:14,199
“When the Himalayan peasant
meets the he-bear in his pride...

611
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:18,092
He shouts to scare the monster,
who will often turn aside...

612
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:22,855
but the she-bear thus accosted rends
the peasant tooth and nail.

613
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:26,712
For the female of the species is
more deadly than the male...”

614
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:50,791
If I can’t hear you then
I can’t see you.

615
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:53,696
And if I can’t see you
then you are not here.

616
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:57,495
And if you are not here,
I am not going mad.

617
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,008
I will not go mad.

618
00:55:59,043 --> 00:56:02,872
I will not...
I will not go mad.

619
00:56:05,206 --> 00:56:09,492
Baroness Thatcher made an apparently
routine visit to her doctor today.

620
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:11,621
Although rarely seen in public,

621
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:14,972
the longest serving Prime Minister
of the twentieth century,

622
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:17,270
remains a controversial figure.

623
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:21,072
Almost lovingly dubbed by the
Soviets The Iron Lady,

624
00:56:21,107 --> 00:56:23,808
she’s also credited,
with her friend Ronald Reagan,

625
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:27,006
with a decisive role in the ending
of the Cold War.

626
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,496
Her supporters claim she
transformed the British...

627
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:33,007
economy and reversed
the country’s post-war decline.

628
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:36,119
Her detractors blame her
savage public spending...

629
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:39,159
cuts and sweeping privatization of -

630
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:48,254
I don’t recognize myself.

631
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,728
Am I out of the doghouse yet?

632
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:22,726
They’re unveiling that portrait...

633
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:25,507
of me at Number 10
next month.

634
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,506
The invitation’s on the mantelpiece.

635
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:33,209
So...

636
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,386
there’ll be Churchill,

637
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:38,515
Lloyd George and me.

638
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:40,951
Just the three of us.

639
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,274
I said I didn’t want any big fuss
but they insisted.

640
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:52,189
Lovely little article in The Telegraph.

641
00:57:54,068 --> 00:57:57,807
The Woman Who Changed
the Face of History.

642
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:06,948
Less than two years ago,

643
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,046
the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis...

644
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:16,501
and talked about bringing faith,

645
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,874
hope and harmony to this country.

646
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:23,668
Denis?

647
00:58:35,748 --> 00:58:37,965
Can the Right Honourable Lady deny,

648
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,612
that having brought about
the highest level...

649
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:43,957
of unemployment since 1934-

650
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,842
The biggest fall in total output...

651
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,586
in steel and coal production
in one year since 1931.

652
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:58,484
And the biggest collapse in
industrial production since 1921.

653
00:58:58,519 --> 00:59:00,360
Order, Order.

654
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:07,749
Can she also accept that her
free market economics...

655
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:11,279
designed to create a
growing middle class...

656
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:16,387
ensures that the rich get richer
and the poor are irrelevant!

657
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:19,074
Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out!
Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out!

658
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,739
You’re supposed to be a mother!

659
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,302
You’re not a mother,
you’re a monster!

660
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,641
May we have a word,
Prime Minister?

661
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:34,326
Yes, but in order to arrive
at the palace on time,

662
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:37,617
Geoffrey and I are will be walking
out of that door in 15 minutes.

663
00:59:37,652 --> 00:59:39,595
As you can see.
- I know you’re running late Margaret...

664
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,443
but we have to address this
situation in light...

665
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:44,075
of tomorrow’s blistering
press coverage. Blistering!

666
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:45,181
The knives are out.

667
00:59:45,216 --> 00:59:48,873
Your draft budget’s been leaked,
Geoffrey, they are baying for our blood!

668
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:53,483
Michael we can’t possibly buckle
at the first sign of difficulty.

669
00:59:53,518 --> 00:59:55,976
No one is saying we have to buckle.
- But is this really the time to...

670
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:58,714
make these spending cuts in the
middle of one of the deepest...

671
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:01,666
recessions this country
has ever experienced?

672
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,227
We need a plan of action, Margaret.
- Absolutely. A strategy.

673
01:00:05,262 --> 01:00:06,719
We must be armed.

674
01:00:06,755 --> 01:00:08,848
There’s a perception, Margaret...

675
01:00:08,883 --> 01:00:12,510
rightly or wrongly, that we are now
completely out of touch with the country.

676
01:00:12,544 --> 01:00:16,106
Really.
How much is a pack of Lurpak?

677
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:18,769
Lurpak?
- Butter, Francis.

678
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:20,757
Forty two pence.

679
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:23,160
Anchor butter is forty pence.

680
01:00:23,194 --> 01:00:27,095
Flora margarine, still the cheapest,
is thirty eight pence.

681
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:30,198
I can assure you
I am not out of touch.

682
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,953
“Grocer’s Daughter”

683
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:37,118
What - did you say?

684
01:00:37,153 --> 01:00:38,253
Nothing. Prime Minister, Nothing.

685
01:00:38,288 --> 01:00:41,242
No, no, please.
Don’t try to hide you opinions.

686
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:43,894
Goodness me, I’d much rather
you were open and...

687
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:46,123
straight forward about them

688
01:00:46,158 --> 01:00:50,481
instead of continuously and
damagingly leaking them to the press.

689
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:57,517
Well?
- Well,

690
01:00:58,038 --> 01:01:00,327
people can’t pay their mortgages.

691
01:01:00,362 --> 01:01:02,669
The manufacturing industry is
practically on its knees.

692
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:06,169
Honest, hard-working, decent
people are losing their homes.

693
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,426
It’s terribly shameful.

694
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:10,015
The point is, Prime Minister, that
we must moderate the pace -

695
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,238
- if we’re even to have a hope of
winning the next election-

696
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:15,748
Quite right.
Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?

697
01:01:18,272 --> 01:01:21,300
Gentlemen, if we don’t cut
spending we will be bankrupt.

698
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:24,290
Yes, the medicine is harsh...

699
01:01:24,325 --> 01:01:28,479
but the patient requires
it in order to live.

700
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:34,981
Shall we withhold the medicine?
No! We are not wrong.

701
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:39,893
We did not seek election and
win in order to manage...

702
01:01:39,928 --> 01:01:41,848
the decline of a great nation.

703
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,973
The people of this country
chose us...

704
01:01:45,008 --> 01:01:48,383
because they believe we can
restore the health of

705
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:51,232
the British economy and
we will do just that!

706
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:54,397
Barring a failure of nerve.

707
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:59,184
Anything else?
- Prime Minister.

708
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:03,859
You saved the day
once again, Crawfie,

709
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,667
you’re an angel.

710
01:02:07,238 --> 01:02:11,794
You can’t close down a discussion
because it’s not what you wish to hear.

711
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:15,683
I don’t expect everyone just to
sit there and agree with me.

712
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:18,866
But what kind of leader am I if I
don’t try to get my own way-

713
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,005
to do what I know to be right.
- Yes.

714
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:23,074
But Margaret,

715
01:02:25,137 --> 01:02:30,109
one must be careful of testing
one’s colleagues’ loyalty too far.

716
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:49,249
We are now one split nation,

717
01:02:49,408 --> 01:02:53,506
with a huge gulf dividing
the employed from the unemployed.

718
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:59,487
The Thatcher plan is to break
the Trade Union movement.

719
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:03,337
There must be closures of
uneconomic coal mines,

720
01:03:03,372 --> 01:03:06,747
we seek only
an efficient industry.

721
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:10,513
The miners are being starved back
to work, the need is desperate!

722
01:03:23,798 --> 01:03:26,454
There are those who would
say hold back,

723
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:29,592
there are those who
would make us retreat -

724
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:32,806
But we shall never
give in to them.

725
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,298
We shall never waver,
not for a second,

726
01:03:37,749 --> 01:03:42,735
in our determination to see
this country prosper once again.

727
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:55,794
A car bomb has exploded outside
Harrods department store, killing...

728
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:57,977
six people and injuring 71.

729
01:03:58,012 --> 01:04:01,016
Eleven soldiers died today when
two bombs were detonated during...

730
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:03,947
military parades in Hyde Park
and Regent’s Park.

731
01:04:03,982 --> 01:04:06,374
Seven horses also
died in the blasts.

732
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,801
The IRA have claimed
responsibility.

733
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:25,269
And now, it must be
business as usual.

734
01:04:35,382 --> 01:04:37,454
Come on love, get to bed.

735
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:40,082
I don’t know why you do this
to yourself every year,

736
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:43,370
it’s a speech at conference,
not the Magna Carta!

737
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:50,740
Time to call it a day, darling.
It’s ten to three, for God’s sake.

738
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:54,771
I know, I’m coming DT. Nearly
there -

739
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,996
Denis!

740
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:13,140
Denis-

741
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:21,000
there you are.
Are you alright?

742
01:05:26,606 --> 01:05:28,048
My shoes!

743
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:40,136
That’s when I thought I’d lost you.

744
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,511
Mark?

745
01:05:53,694 --> 01:05:55,173
Hello darling.

746
01:05:57,356 --> 01:06:00,759
No, I’m fine.

747
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:04,878
I’m very well, How is...

748
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,812
Sarah?

749
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:10,541
And the children..?

750
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:15,443
Oh...

751
01:06:18,092 --> 01:06:19,407
You can’t.

752
01:06:20,787 --> 01:06:22,328
That’s a pity.

753
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:28,478
I was hoping to see you.

754
01:06:30,588 --> 01:06:31,468
Yes...

755
01:06:31,503 --> 01:06:34,535
Oh... No That’s fine.
Really darling.

756
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,217
That’s fine.

757
01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:40,791
Of course...
another time.

758
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,207
Yes... Darling.

759
01:06:46,578 --> 01:06:48,610
Yes... Can’t wait... Lovely.

760
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:51,586
Yes...

761
01:06:54,121 --> 01:06:55,864
xxx Mark?

762
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:26,184
That was Mark. Not able to come.

763
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:28,582
Boy’s always going AWOL.

764
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:33,051
Well it costs him a great deal
to fly everyone up here.

765
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:36,832
There you go, making excuses for
him. Now look where it’s got you.

766
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:41,771
Did you know Yul Brynner was a
gypsy from Vladivostok?

767
01:07:41,806 --> 01:07:46,201
Yes. He moved to Paris
when he was fourteen.

768
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:49,617
He played the King of Siam...

769
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:55,651
4,625 times on the London
and Broadway stages.

770
01:07:56,563 --> 01:07:58,868
What are you doing?

771
01:07:58,903 --> 01:08:02,115
One likes to make an effort.
A snifter?

772
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:05,273
You’re dead, Denis.

773
01:08:05,308 --> 01:08:10,637
Ah. Well, if I’m dead... who are
you talking to? Shall we dance?

774
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:55,415
The Falkland islands, the British Colony
in the South Atlantic, has fallen.

775
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,362
Argentina claims its marines went ashore
as a spearhead this morning...

776
01:08:59,397 --> 01:09:03,005
to capture key targets,
including the capital, Port Stanley.

777
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,191
Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta...

778
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,807
which is a fascist gang...

779
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:13,219
has invaded our sovereign territory.
This cannot be tolerated.

780
01:09:13,254 --> 01:09:17,499
May I make plain my
negotiating position.

781
01:09:17,534 --> 01:09:22,028
I will not negotiate with
criminals or thugs.

782
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:27,531
The Falkland islands belong to
Britain, and I want them back.

783
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:32,841
Gentlemen, I need you to tell me
today if that is possible.

784
01:09:32,876 --> 01:09:35,482
Possible... just, Prime Minister.

785
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:38,588
We can have a Task Force ready
to sail in forty-eight hours.

786
01:09:38,623 --> 01:09:41,413
Forty-eight hours?
But...

787
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:43,359
We have a very narrow
weather window.

788
01:09:43,393 --> 01:09:45,940
We can’t fight in winter down there.
Nobody can.

789
01:09:46,931 --> 01:09:50,887
If we are going,
we have to go now.

790
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:59,046
Why were the islands left without
any naval protection?

791
01:09:59,081 --> 01:10:03,609
In the last round of Defence cuts
we judged the risk of invasion to be small.

792
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:05,024
Did we?

793
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,737
And if you remember, Prime Minister,

794
01:10:06,772 --> 01:10:11,589
you agreed that we should reduce the naval
presence in the area to an absolute minimum.

795
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:19,588
Margaret, the cost
of sending 28,000 men...

796
01:10:19,623 --> 01:10:24,580
and a hundred ships twelve thousand miles,
almost to Argentina, will be absolutely crippling.

797
01:10:24,614 --> 01:10:28,173
I don’t think we should be worrying
about money at this point, Geoffrey.

798
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:29,919
We can’t afford to go to war.

799
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:32,279
We have to go now.

800
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:34,475
now.

801
01:10:37,744 --> 01:10:43,148
The government has now decided
that a large task force will sail,

802
01:10:43,183 --> 01:10:47,294
as soon as all preparations
are complete.

803
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:53,640
Prime Minister we do still have three
weeks before our ships reach the islands.

804
01:10:53,675 --> 01:10:57,602
All we’re saying is that we shouldn’t
give up on trying to find a diplomatic solution.

805
01:10:58,582 --> 01:11:01,818
The U.S. Secretary of State has
arrived, Prime Minister.

806
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,810
So you are proposing to go to war
over these Islands.

807
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:11,018
They’re thousands of miles away,
a handful of citizens,

808
01:11:11,053 --> 01:11:15,034
politically and economically insignificant,
if you’ll excuse me.

809
01:11:15,069 --> 01:11:18,638
Just like Hawaii, I imagine.

810
01:11:19,537 --> 01:11:20,839
I’m sorry?

811
01:11:20,874 --> 01:11:26,113
1941, when Japan attacked
Pearl Harbour.

812
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:28,990
Did America go cap in hand...

813
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:32,453
and ask Tojo for a peaceful
negotiation of terms?

814
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:36,316
Did she turn her back
on her own citizens there...

815
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:40,272
because the islands were thousands
of miles from mainland United States?

816
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:44,227
No, no, no!

817
01:11:44,262 --> 01:11:49,056
We will stand on principle or
we shall not stand at all.

818
01:11:49,091 --> 01:11:53,657
But Margaret with all due respect
when one has been to war...

819
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:55,425
With all due respect sir...

820
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,303
I have done battle every
single day of my life...

821
01:12:00,337 --> 01:12:03,701
and many men have
underestimated me before.

822
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,310
This lot seem bound
to do the same...

823
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:10,184
but they will rue the day.

824
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:14,165
Now, shall I be mother?

825
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:19,193
Tea, Al, how do you take your tea?
Black or white?

826
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:35,783
The Argentinian ship the General
Belgrano and her escorts are pursuing...

827
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:39,461
course 273 degrees toward
the Argentinian mainland.

828
01:12:39,496 --> 01:12:42,290
We are tracking it with our
submarine HMS Conqueror.

829
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:44,612
Is this ship a threat?

830
01:12:44,647 --> 01:12:47,815
Both of these ships are carrying
Exocet missiles, Prime Minister.

831
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:49,820
Just yesterday...

832
01:12:49,855 --> 01:12:54,478
they launched, then aborted an
attack inside the exclusion zone.

833
01:12:54,513 --> 01:12:56,485
There is a risk they could
try it again.

834
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,192
The Belgrano is sailing directly
away from the islands.

835
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:01,315
Can it really be regarded
as a threat?

836
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,464
She’s been changing course continually.

837
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:07,934
There’s a strong possibility that they’re attempting
a pincer movement on our carrier group.

838
01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:11,434
I advise that we engage them:

839
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:15,498
hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others.
Send them all back to port.

840
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:19,188
It’ll play badly internationally.
We’ll be seen as aggressors.

841
01:13:19,223 --> 01:13:21,824
This will be an escalation, Prime Minister.

842
01:13:21,859 --> 01:13:24,871
If there is to be an escalation,
it’s better that we start it.

843
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:27,807
It is steaming away, Prime Minister.

844
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:42,069
Sink it.

845
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:01,077
HMS Sheffield, a Type 42 destroyer,

846
01:14:01,112 --> 01:14:04,690
was attacked and hit late this
afternoon by an Argentine missile...

847
01:14:04,726 --> 01:14:09,309
it is seen as a retaliation for the sinking
of the General Belgrano,

848
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,697
in which over 300 Argentinian
sailors died...

849
01:14:12,732 --> 01:14:16,227
xxx. Latest casualty figures
from the Sheffield.

850
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:19,553
I must write to them.

851
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:22,034
Prime Minister?

852
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,148
The families.

853
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:32,151
I must write to them...

854
01:14:32,152 --> 01:14:41,756
xxx

855
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,826
Foreign Secretary...

856
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:46,360
I’ve just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse.

857
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:51,731
He told me bluntly that if the Argentinians
are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft,

858
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:55,746
they have enough missiles
to cripple most of our fleet.

859
01:14:57,734 --> 01:15:00,332
President Reagan and President Bellaunde
of Peru have

860
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:03,430
some new proposals
for the peace plan -

861
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,071
The peace plan?

862
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:08,993
There will be no appeasement.
This is a war.

863
01:15:09,028 --> 01:15:13,791
A war they started and
by God, we will finish it.

864
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:18,065
I tell you what I’m going
to write...

865
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:23,132
to every single one of these families,
these heartbroken families?

866
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:28,159
I am going to tell them that no
British soldier will die in vain...

867
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,191
for the Falklands.

868
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:37,214
Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
Captain Wood. Captain Dench.

869
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:41,328
I am the only Prime Minister
in the history of our country...

870
01:15:41,363 --> 01:15:45,570
who is also a mother with
a son of my own,

871
01:15:46,092 --> 01:15:50,356
I can imagine your agony,
and your grief.

872
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:55,132
Prime Minister, we have secured
the beach head -

873
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:58,731
The Argentinian troops are
demoralized and ill equipped...

874
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:01,349
The paratroops have
taken Goose Green...

875
01:16:02,378 --> 01:16:07,240
Shortly after dark last night,
our forces xxx Port Stanley...

876
01:16:07,275 --> 01:16:13,194
xxx what the Commander in Chief
has called a brilliant surprise night attack.

877
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,685
Thatcher, bed.

878
01:16:23,838 --> 01:16:28,694
From their new positions, our forces
can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers

879
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:31,720
retreating and streaming back
into Port Stanley.

880
01:16:31,755 --> 01:16:35,806
Our forces are moving forward
to exploit their success.

881
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:58,535
Well done, MARGARET.

882
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:05,587
We congratulate the men and women
of the armed Forces for their skill,

883
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:08,848
bravery and loyalty to this country.

884
01:17:09,718 --> 01:17:14,266
We were faced with an act of
unprovoked aggression...

885
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:19,470
and we responded as we have
responded in times past:

886
01:17:19,505 --> 01:17:24,110
with unity, strength and courage,

887
01:17:24,588 --> 01:17:29,248
sure in the knowledge that
though much is sacrificed,

888
01:17:30,427 --> 01:17:35,206
in the end, right will prevail
over wrong.

889
01:17:37,998 --> 01:17:41,495
And I put it to the Honourable
Member opposite...

890
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:44,990
that this is not a day
for him to carp...

891
01:17:45,025 --> 01:17:48,697
find fault, demand inquiries-

892
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,962
they will happen I can assure
him of that...

893
01:17:52,451 --> 01:17:55,864
for we have nothing
to hide, no...

894
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:01,232
this is a day to put difference aside,

895
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,440
hold one’s head high...

896
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:08,817
and take pride in being British.

897
01:18:32,514 --> 01:18:37,005
GOTCHA! Well that paid off old girl!
Your ratings soared!

898
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,345
From the most hated Prime Minister
of all time to the nation’s darling...

899
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:46,929
The world was at your feet,
and Britain was back in business!

900
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:17,741
The Berlin Wall has fallen.
The gates have opened!

901
01:19:17,776 --> 01:19:21,098
The police are making no attempt to
stop people as they go through.

902
01:19:24,688 --> 01:19:28,251
I don’t agree...
I don’t agree in any measure!

903
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:31,842
But Prime Minister the question of
the European single currency will come up.

904
01:19:31,877 --> 01:19:34,113
I don’t think the country
is ready for it yet.

905
01:19:34,148 --> 01:19:36,774
But we cannot bury our heads
in the sand...

906
01:19:36,809 --> 01:19:39,040
A lot of Conservative MP’s and
Ministers are saying -

907
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,536
- that there must be a change in
that style of management.

908
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:44,678
That Mrs Thatcher must listen more,
and on occasion, give in.

909
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,189
The point is, Prime Minister,

910
01:19:46,224 --> 01:19:50,902
I don’t think we can sell the idea of
a tax that asks everyone to pay the same.

911
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:55,006
Our policies may be unpopular, but
they are the right policies.

912
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:58,607
Prime Minister I just don’t think
we can ask the poorest of the poor...

913
01:19:58,642 --> 01:20:01,495
to pay the same amount
of tax as a multi-millionaire.

914
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,640
There it is again!
Why not?

915
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,072
Because -

916
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:10,043
Because people... on the whole...
think that the tax is manifestly unfair.

917
01:20:10,078 --> 01:20:12,426
Nonsense. Arrant nonsense.

918
01:20:12,461 --> 01:20:16,666
This is a simple proposition.
In order to live in this country,

919
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:19,692
you must pay for the privilege-
something, anything!

920
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:21,997
If you pay nothing,
you care nothing.

921
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:24,922
What do you care where you
throw your rubbish?

922
01:20:24,957 --> 01:20:29,427
Your council estate is a mess,
your town, graffiti, what do you care?

923
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:31,953
It's not your problem,
it's somebody else's problem-

924
01:20:31,988 --> 01:20:33,881
it's the government's problem!

925
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:36,875
Your problem...

926
01:20:37,258 --> 01:20:38,540
Some of you,

927
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:42,311
is that you haven't got
the courage for this fight.

928
01:20:42,862 --> 01:20:45,711
You haven’t had to fight
hard for anything.

929
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:48,883
It's all been given to you-
and you feel guilty about it!

930
01:20:49,455 --> 01:20:53,769
Well, may I say, on behalf of all those
who have had to fight their way up,

931
01:20:53,804 --> 01:20:56,578
and who don't feel guilty about it...

932
01:20:57,468 --> 01:21:00,994
we resent those slackers
who take, take, take...

933
01:21:01,029 --> 01:21:03,301
and contribute nothing
to the community!

934
01:21:03,336 --> 01:21:06,653
And I see the same thing,
the same cowardice...

935
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:09,463
in our fight within
the European Union.

936
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:10,671
Cowardice.

937
01:21:10,706 --> 01:21:15,439
For the sovereignty of Britain
the integrity of the pound!

938
01:21:15,474 --> 01:21:20,731
Some of you want to make concessions.

939
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,006
I hear some of you...

940
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:28,570
agree with the latest
French proposals.

941
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:31,268
Well, why don’t you get on
a boat to Calais?

942
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,703
Yes, why don't you put on a beret,

943
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:38,028
and pay 85% of your income
to the French government!

944
01:21:47,304 --> 01:21:48,103
Right.

945
01:21:49,423 --> 01:21:53,349
What can we realistically hope to achieve
by the end of session, Lord President?

946
01:21:53,384 --> 01:21:56,797
And why have we not made
more progress to date?

947
01:21:56,832 --> 01:22:00,388
What is that?
Is that the timetable?

948
01:22:00,423 --> 01:22:03,658
I haven't seen that.
May I see it?

949
01:22:03,693 --> 01:22:05,718
Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course.

950
01:22:12,748 --> 01:22:14,321
The wording is sloppy here...

951
01:22:17,842 --> 01:22:18,890
and here.

952
01:22:18,925 --> 01:22:21,610
If you say so.
- I do say so.

953
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,583
It’s merely a first draft...

954
01:22:23,618 --> 01:22:29,580
This is ridiculous. There are
two “T’s” in “committee”!

955
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:33,647
Two “T’s”.
This is shameful. Shameful!

956
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:41,707
I can’t even rely on you for
a simple timetable!

957
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:42,513
Are you unwell?

958
01:22:44,344 --> 01:22:47,826
Yes. You are unwell.

959
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,380
Give me the pencil, give it to me!

960
01:22:57,948 --> 01:23:01,308
If this is the best you can do I
had better send you to hospital,

961
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:04,830
and I shall do your job as well as
my own and everyone else’s.

962
01:23:04,865 --> 01:23:05,657
Gentlemen.

963
01:23:05,692 --> 01:23:09,436
As the Lord President has thosen
to come to cabinet unprepared...

964
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,821
I have to close this meeting.

965
01:23:18,717 --> 01:23:19,599
Good morning!

966
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:15,930
Can’t pay, won’t pay!

967
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:53,707
Geoffrey-

968
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,141
My letter of resignation.

969
01:25:00,197 --> 01:25:05,650
Our differences, I’m afraid,
cannot be reconciled.

970
01:25:17,649 --> 01:25:23,472
I have done what I believe to be right
for my party and my country.

971
01:25:24,622 --> 01:25:26,877
The time has come for
others to consider...

972
01:25:28,036 --> 01:25:32,361
their own response to the tragic
conflict of loyalties...

973
01:25:32,396 --> 01:25:34,743
with which I have myself wrestled
for perhaps too long.

974
01:25:34,778 --> 01:25:36,924
Geoffrey’s speech in the House of
Commons was devastating.

975
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:38,466
xxx

976
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:42,047
He was almost inviting someone to
challenge her for leadership of the party.

977
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:44,238
She behaved appallingly.

978
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:46,898
I wouldn’t have spoken to
my gamekeeper like that.

979
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:51,455
I don’t think she can survive this.

980
01:25:52,369 --> 01:25:54,373
I’m here to announce my decision

981
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,528
to put my name forward as leader
of the Conservative party.

982
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:04,193
I have nothing but admiration for our
Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher,

983
01:26:04,996 --> 01:26:05,962
but I believe...

984
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:11,324
our party and our country
need a new leader.

985
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,652
It’s extraordinary.

986
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:17,069
I am the Prime Minister.
- The rules of the Conservative Party...

987
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:21,523
make it possible for Conservative MP’s
to depose a sitting Prime Minister.

988
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:22,335
Sweetie?

989
01:26:22,372 --> 01:26:23,847
xxx

990
01:26:23,882 --> 01:26:26,784
As Conservative MP’s gather
in Westminster to discus...

991
01:26:26,819 --> 01:26:29,879
who they will back in the leadership
contest, the Prime Minister said...

992
01:26:29,914 --> 01:26:33,332
she would not be diverted
from critical international affairs.

993
01:26:33,367 --> 01:26:37,770
Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is
among thirty four world leaders

994
01:26:37,805 --> 01:26:41,554
who came together to celebrate
the end of the Cold War and herald...

995
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:45,540
the start of a peaceful new age
of East/West cooperation.

996
01:26:45,964 --> 01:26:50,559
There’s a general feeling that Mrs Thatcher
is going to win on the first ballot.

997
01:26:50,594 --> 01:26:54,493
We’re going to put it to bed tomorrow night,
is how one of her campaign staff puts it.

998
01:26:56,322 --> 01:27:00,487
M, I really think you should come home
and defend yourself old girl.

999
01:27:00,522 --> 01:27:03,259
Heseltine is campaigning ferociously.

1000
01:27:03,294 --> 01:27:07,099
I do think my time is best spent seeing
an end to the Cold War...

1001
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:10,808
don’t you? After all this time
they know what I stand for.

1002
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,862
Will she, or will she not,
be in the job tomorrow?

1003
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:20,232
Margaret, they can’t touch you.

1004
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:29,320
Mrs Thatcher has failed to win
enough votes to secure an outright...

1005
01:27:29,355 --> 01:27:32,117
win in the leadership contest
and must now decide...

1006
01:27:32,152 --> 01:27:35,412
whether to put her name forward
for the second round.

1007
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:40,143
As Mrs Thatcher leaves Paris for London
to make a last ditch attempt...

1008
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:44,412
to pull together support for her
leadership, the ship may have sailed.

1009
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:48,322
Treachery!

1010
01:27:49,093 --> 01:27:53,169
We will never win another election
led by that woman.

1011
01:27:53,204 --> 01:27:54,929
We need a leader who listens.

1012
01:27:54,964 --> 01:27:56,971
This isn’t about her,
it’s about the party.

1013
01:27:57,006 --> 01:27:58,927
One must know when to go.

1014
01:27:58,962 --> 01:28:01,359
The question is, how does
anyone put it to her?

1015
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,506
If you were to stand, I of course
would vote for you Prime Minister-

1016
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:10,088
of course would vote for you Prime
Minister, but I don’t think you can win.

1017
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:12,831
The loyalty of my colleagues
cannot be counted upon.

1018
01:28:12,866 --> 01:28:14,199
It was the people who put me here -

1019
01:28:14,234 --> 01:28:17,542
The loyalty of my colleagues
cannot be counted upon.

1020
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,643
- it’s up to them to tell
me when to go.

1021
01:28:21,678 --> 01:28:25,299
Margaret, you can’t let them
do this to you.

1022
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:28,183
Please, boss.

1023
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:33,453
They’ll destroy you.
Throw in the towel now, love.

1024
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:38,526
Don’t let those bastards
see you humiliated.

1025
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:46,145
You just won’t win, darling.
Not this time.

1026
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:50,704
Oh Denis.

1027
01:28:54,465 --> 01:28:56,366
I am the Prime Minister.

1028
01:28:57,527 --> 01:28:59,950
Order! Order!

1029
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,398
The Right Honourable gentleman is afraid!

1030
01:29:02,433 --> 01:29:06,030
This is a naked strategy of
closing some coal mines...

1031
01:29:06,065 --> 01:29:08,749
and then selling off.
- They believe in striking...

1032
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:11,474
I believe in working!
- This is the woman who’s watched...

1033
01:29:11,509 --> 01:29:15,761
ten men on hunger strike starve themselves
to death and never flinched!

1034
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:16,732
Despicable.

1035
01:29:17,563 --> 01:29:22,701
More homeowners, more
shareholders, more savings -

1036
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:31,895
xxx

1037
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,952
I offer my resignation...

1038
01:29:34,551 --> 01:29:37,846
after eleven and a half
extraordinary years -

1039
01:29:38,819 --> 01:29:42,863
proud to have left Britain in
a much better state...

1040
01:29:42,898 --> 01:29:44,446
than when we took office.

1041
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:55,349
What’s this then?

1042
01:29:58,678 --> 01:29:59,812
A radio...

1043
01:30:01,525 --> 01:30:02,940
How useful.

1044
01:30:49,663 --> 01:30:51,005
Steady, MT.

1045
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,620
The greatest Prime Minister
since Churchill...

1046
01:31:09,655 --> 01:31:12,816
deposed by a bunch
of spineless pygmies!

1047
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:17,002
All those years of taking
the tough decisions...

1048
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:19,226
does any of it matter now?

1049
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:20,751
It’s all been turned to mush!

1050
01:31:20,786 --> 01:31:23,272
What?
- By these fools!

1051
01:31:23,307 --> 01:31:25,829
These lily-livered pinkos!

1052
01:31:25,864 --> 01:31:30,626
These inept placators.
- Very good! These vacillators.

1053
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:34,562
Vacillators! Poll takers.
- Popularity seekers.

1054
01:31:34,597 --> 01:31:37,513
So busy taking the pulse of the public!

1055
01:31:37,548 --> 01:31:39,123
Weak.
Is weak.

1056
01:31:39,158 --> 01:31:42,241
Weak...
- All off them. Weak.

1057
01:31:42,277 --> 01:31:43,424
Men!

1058
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:49,954
Don’t they know if you take
the tough decisions.

1059
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:56,647
Yes, people will hate you today
but they’ll thank you for generations.

1060
01:31:56,682 --> 01:32:00,362
Or forget you entirely and chuck
you out with the rubbish!

1061
01:32:19,288 --> 01:32:23,153
All I wanted was to make a
difference in the world.

1062
01:32:23,188 --> 01:32:26,345
And you did, love, you did.

1063
01:32:33,622 --> 01:32:38,777
All I wanted was for my children
to grow up well and be happy...

1064
01:32:38,812 --> 01:32:41,629
happier than I was certainly.

1065
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:49,079
xxx

1066
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,442
Oh, yes.

1067
01:32:57,979 --> 01:33:00,435
And I wanted you to
be happy of course.

1068
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,341
Were you happy, Denis?

1069
01:33:07,036 --> 01:33:08,638
Tell me the truth.

1070
01:34:30,901 --> 01:34:31,689
Denis?

1071
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:35,602
Denis?

1072
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:44,737
Here’s your bag.
You’re all packed, sorted.

1073
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:10,156
Denis wait.
Where are your shoes?

1074
01:35:10,999 --> 01:35:14,149
No, you can’t go without shoes!

1075
01:35:16,632 --> 01:35:18,953
Not yet.
- Steady.

1076
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,966
Yes.
Steady.

1077
01:35:23,297 --> 01:35:25,324
Steady the buffs.
- Steady the buffs.

1078
01:35:27,308 --> 01:35:31,382
No. Not yet. Denis.

1079
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:33,510
Wait...

1080
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:38,579
I don’t, I cant.
I don’t want you to go yet.

1081
01:35:39,377 --> 01:35:41,576
Denis. Please.

1082
01:35:42,634 --> 01:35:46,354
No, no. You are not.

1083
01:35:47,087 --> 01:35:50,609
I don’t want to be on my own.

1084
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:55,658
You’re going to be fine on your own,
love. You always have been.

1085
01:35:59,997 --> 01:36:00,954
Denis!

1086
01:36:03,068 --> 01:36:05,602
xxx

1087
01:36:36,843 --> 01:36:37,745
Mummy-

1088
01:36:38,854 --> 01:36:41,851
My God, Mum.
Are you alright?

1089
01:36:41,886 --> 01:36:44,700
Yes.
- What are you doing.

1090
01:36:44,735 --> 01:36:46,428
Yes.

1091
01:36:46,463 --> 01:36:50,346
Mummy you should have called
for help, silly old sausage.

1092
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:53,117
Have you not even been in
your bed properly?

1093
01:36:53,152 --> 01:36:56,668
You’ve done all this?
- Yes, all sorted.

1094
01:36:56,703 --> 01:37:00,975
Well don’t worry about all this.
June and I will crack on with it.

1095
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:04,117
I was just going to get dressed.

1096
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:07,760
Shall I call someone, see if anyone
can come over and do your hair?

1097
01:37:08,970 --> 01:37:12,261
Oh. No, you do it.

1098
01:37:35,931 --> 01:37:37,753
Oh, let me do that, Margaret.

1099
01:37:37,788 --> 01:37:40,635
No, dear, I’ll do it.

1100
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,512
Carol said you might go to the
House of Lords today?

1101
01:37:44,547 --> 01:37:48,833
No no. I’m not going anywhere.

1102
01:40:19,817 --> 01:40:21,912
Noppes
