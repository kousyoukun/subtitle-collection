1
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Very nearly there, sir.

2
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,600
I have to say your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?

3
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,400
- Occasionally. - Of course, I've seen
you in the English newspapers.

4
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,900
- Are you a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.

5
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,500
Be patient, Snowy.
Not much longer.

6
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
Oh! I do beg your pardon.

7
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,300
There. I do believe I've captured
something of your likeness.

8
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,200
Not bad.
What do you think, Snowy?

9
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,500
Oh, Snowy ...

10
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
There you are Sir..

11
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
Now where's he run off to?

12
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,900
- Anything?
- Nothing.

13
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Snowy!

14
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,100
Where have you been?

15
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
Chasing cats again?

16
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Snowy. Look at This.

17
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Triple Masted, double
decks and 50 guns.

18
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,700
- Isn't she a beauty?
- That's a very unique specimen that is

19
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,400
from an old
sea captain's estate.

20
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,200
- The Unicorn.
- The Unicorn, man-o-war sailing ship

21
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,100
- It's very old that is 16th century.
- 17th, I would think.

22
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
- Reign of Charles the first.
- Charles the second.

23
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,800
That's what I said,Charles the 2nd. as finer ship as
ever sailed the seven seas.

24
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,900
you won't find another one of these mate!

25
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
and it's only 2 quid.

26
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done.

27
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Carefully does it.

28
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
There you go. Careful.

29
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,600
- Hey, buddy. How much for the boat?
- I'm sorry, I just sold it to this young gent

30
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh, yeah? Tell me what you paid?
I'll give you double.

31
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,300
- Double?
- Thanks, but it is not for sale.

32
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Look, kid. I'm trying
to help you out.

33
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't think you realize this,
but you are about to walk

34
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,100
- into a whole mess of danger.
- What kind of danger?

35
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm warning you. Get rid of the boat
and get out while you still can.

36
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,900
These people do not play nice.

37
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,400
- What people ?...
- Wonderful!!.

38
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
It's just wonderful.

39
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?

40
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,800
If you want to buy it,
you'll have to talk to the kid.

41
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,700
I see! ... well...

42
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
- ..let the 'kid' name his price.
- Name his price? Oh ...

43
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,500
Ten years I've been flogging briq-a-brac and I miss
"name your price" by one blinking minute.

44
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm sorry, but I've already explained
to the other gentleman...

45
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,100
American he was.
All hair oil and no socks.

46
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,700
It is not for sale.

47
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,600
Then let me appeal
to your better nature.

48
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,200
I've recently acquired Marlinspike
Hall and this ship, as you know,

49
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,500
- Was once part of the estate ...
- Of the late sea captain.

50
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
The family fell upon hard-times.
They lost everything.

51
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,900
They have been living in a
cloud of bad luck ever since

52
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,400
We are talking generations of
drinking and irrational behavior of ...

53
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm sorry, but as I told you before...

54
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,400
it is not for sale.

55
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,500
Good day to you Sir.

56
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,100
That young man,
What's his name?

57
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Him! Everybody knows him.
That's Tintin.

58
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,400
What is it about this ship?

59
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,900
Why it has attracted
so much attention?

60
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,100
What secrets do you hold?

61
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,400
Where is that magnifying glass?

62
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,500
I could have sworn,
that it was somewhere.

63
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
Snowy, you haven't seen the errr ...

64
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,900
Where is it?

65
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Thank you.

66
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,400
No, Snowy!

67
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
Look, what you did!

68
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,600
You broke it. Bad dog.

69
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Something happened on this ship.

70
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
We're going to the one place
that could have the answer.

71
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,900
Come on Snowy.

72
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,300
Here it is. Sir Francis
Haddock of Marlinspike Hall

73
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,400
The last captain of
the ill-fated unicorn.

74
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Ship set sail from
Barbados in 1676...

75
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,200
...on one of the most ruinest
voyages in maritime history.

76
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,800
The ship never reached its
destination. attacked by Pirates.

77
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
All hands lost except
for one survivor.

78
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
When Sir Francis was
rescued and returned home -

79
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,300
He was convinced his
name had been cursed.

80
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,200
The Unicorn's manifest stated they
we're carrying a cargo...

81
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,700
...of rum and tobacco
bound for Europe, but...

82
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200
...it was long claimed "the ship was
carrying a secret cargo."

83
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?

84
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,800
"Historians have tried and failed...

85
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,100
...to discover what happened
on that fatal voyage."

86
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,100
But, Sir Francis's last words:

87
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,500
"Only a true Haddock will discover
The Secret of the Unicorn."

88
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,200
Missed something Snowy.

89
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,500
I need to take a closer
look at that model.

90
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,100
Of course, it's gone!
How can I be so stupid?

91
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,400
MARLINSPIKE HALL

92
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
How did you do that?

93
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Clever boy.

94
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,800
That Coat of Arms.

95
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,500
Why does it look familiar?

96
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,100
Hang on.

97
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,500
That fish is a haddock.

98
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,900
Of course! Marlinspike Hall is
the old Haddock estate.

99
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,500
Snowy!

100
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,600
Well done Snowy. Good boy.

101
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
Well well well.

102
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,500
It seems we caught our thief.

103
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,900
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

104
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,000
- I see you let yourself in.
- I came to retrieve my property.

105
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,400
- I'm sorry I'm not sure I follow you
- Oh I think you do.

106
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,000
This ship was stolen from my
apartment less than an hour ago.

107
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
I'm afraid you are mistaken,
Mr. Tintin.

108
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,600
- There is no mistake.
It belongs to me. - Are you sure?

109
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
Of course I am sure. I took it home.

110
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
I put it on the cabinet
in the living room

111
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,600
and then Snowy chased the
cat and knocked it over ...

112
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
It fell.

113
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,800
- This isn't my ship.
- No. Indeed.

114
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,900
- Sorry. It looks identical.
- Looks can be deceiving

115
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,100
Yes indeed. But I don't understand.

116
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,100
Why did Sir Francis make two
ships exactly alike?

117
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
And you have one already.
Why did you want another?

118
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,300
What is it about this model that will
cause someone to steal it?

119
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,000
Goodness me! Why so many questions?

120
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,200
It is my job. There could be a story here.

121
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,700
- That's what I do you see.
- It's no great mystery.

122
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Sir Francis Haddock was a
drunkard and a hopeless reprobate

123
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,600
He was doomed to fail and he be
bequeathed that failure to his sons.

124
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,300
So it is true.
Haddock line is cursed.

125
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?

126
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
-That depends what you are looking for.
- I'm looking for answers -

127
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,600
- Mr. Sakharine.
- You're looking in the wrong place.

128
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
It is late.
I think you should go home.

129
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,900
This way, sir.

130
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,100
- It's a pity, sir.
- I'm sorry?

131
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
That the mast broke on
your model ship, sir.

132
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
I hope you found all the pieces.

133
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,600
- Things are so easily lost.
- Nestor, where are you?

134
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Good night, sir.

135
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
"Some things are easily lost."

136
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,300
What did he mean by that Snowy?

137
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,900
What was he trying to tell me?

138
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,800
"Some things are easily lost."

139
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,300
Snowy.

140
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,900
Great snakes!

141
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,200
What is it Snowy?

142
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,300
What's this?

143
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,900
Aha! this was in the mast.

144
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,100
Good boy, Snowy.

145
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Three brothers joined to three
Unicorn in company.

146
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Sailing in the noonday sun will speak.
For it's from the light.

147
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,600
That light will dawn and then
shines forth the eagle's cross.

148
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
What are these markings?
It's kind of a secret language

149
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,900
...or code. Makes no sense!

150
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,400
But it does explain why
they ransacked the flat.

151
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,400
They were looking for this
and they didn't find it.

152
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,500
which means...

153
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,200
...they will be back.

154
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,900
I have to go back to my cocoa.

155
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,800
I have got a very good
book and a cup of cocoa.

156
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,200
- It's really lovely.
- Thank you, Mrs. Finch.

157
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,400
I can look after this.

158
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,400
Hey kid, is that you?
open the door.

159
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,900
- What do you want?
- Look, the game is up.

160
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,900
He's going to be back. Now I know he
wanted those boats, but I swear to God...

161
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,100
I never thought he'd
kill anyone over it. - Who?

162
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,600
- Who you are talking about? - I'm trying
to tell you, that your life is in danger.

163
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Answer me! WHO?

164
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Mrs.. Finch! A man has been
shot on our doorstep!

165
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,100
- Now indeed?
- Call an ambulance!

166
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Whoa, Snowy!

167
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,300
Can you hear me?
Can you?

168
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,600
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.

169
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
He was one of the top
agents at Interpol.

170
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,400
But we haven't got a clue,
what he was working on.

171
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,100
Quite right Thomson.
We're completely clueless.

172
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,800
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?

173
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,200
Steady on Tintin, we are still filling out the
paperwork.

174
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,300
Police work is not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.

175
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,300
Well I might have something for you.

176
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
Before he lost consciousness, Dawes tried to tell me something.

177
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,400
...and I think he was spelling out a word.
B, O, U...

178
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,500
D, J, A, N

179
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,000
- "Karaboudjan."
- Karaboudjan!

180
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,300
- Does that mean anything to you? -
- Great Scotland Yard!

181
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,900
- Its extraordinary.
- What is?

182
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,100
Werthingtons have a half price sale
on bowler hats!!

183
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,000
Really Thompson?
It is hardly the time!

184
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,700
- What is it? canes are half price too.
- Do you take charge of this evidence?

185
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,700
Never fear, Tintin.
The evidence is safe with us.

186
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,500
- I'm going down!
- Please hurry?

187
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,200
Well! I am already downstairs.
Do try keep up.

188
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Wait! You dropped this.

189
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,500
Look after the evidence.

190
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,900
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.

191
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,200
Oh, yes. Like our light fingered larcenist.

192
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,100
- What? - The pickpocket.
He has no idea what is coming.

193
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,300
Come-on Tintin, take my wallet.

194
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,500
Yes. Industrial strength elastic.

195
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,800
- Very resourceful.
- On the contrary.

196
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,500
- It was childishly simple.
- Simply childish, I agree.

197
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,400
- Tintin.
- Gentlemen.

198
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,200
Mind you, I expect he's
miles away by now.

199
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,900
I presume, you are referring
to the Pickpocket.

200
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,500
We were just a few
steps behind him.

201
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,700
Snowy, what is it boy?
What do you see?

202
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,900
- I don't suppose you fancy a cup of tea.
- You are quite mistaken.

203
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,900
- I got you now!
- Stop!

204
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
I got you!

205
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,500
What going on down there?
Come on, Snowy.

206
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,300
- Beg your pardon.
- I am sorry, sir.

207
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,400
Pickpocket
Tintin, he is getting away!

208
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,700
My wallet, it's gone.

209
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,800
Come on, Snowy! After him!

210
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,500
Stop! Wait!

211
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Gotcha! Steady on

212
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,600
I've lost him.
You must find my wallet.

213
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,300
- It's very important, I have to
get it back. - And you will.

214
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,600
Leave it to the Professionals.

215
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,000
We lost the scroll
but we haven't lost the story.

216
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,700
Karaboudjan. It's an Armenian word.

217
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,200
That's our lead Snowy. What Barnaby
Dawes trying to tell us?

218
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,400
- Mr. Tin....tin.
- Yes?

219
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,900
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.

220
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Well that's because it's you...for delivery

221
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Get off me!

222
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,300
Shake him off from the bumper!

223
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,900
- He's not here, look your side.

224
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,600
- Hang on, nothing.
- Well, check that pocket.

225
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,000
- I've looked that one already, I'm sure
of it. - Have a look at his socks?

226
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
- Have you found it?
- Doesn't have it.

227
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,600
- It's not here, boss.
- Not here! Then where is it?

228
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,000
- Where is what?
- I'm tired of your games.

229
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,200
The scroll from the Unicorn.
A piece of paper, like this.

230
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,700
- Do you mean the poem?
- Yes.

231
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,300
- The poem written in old English?
- Yes.

232
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,900
- Was inside the cylinder.
- Yes.

233
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,400
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes.

234
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,400
I don't have it.

235
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,400
You don't value that scroll.
Why else would you take it?

236
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm confused. Two scrolls,
but the part of a puzzle.

237
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,300
You have one, but you need
the other. That's not it.

238
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
It is something else.

239
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,100
I'll find it.
With or without your help.

240
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,400
You need to think about, exactly
how useful you are to me.

241
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,300
- Deal with him on the way.
- Ok.

242
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Hold this course.

243
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
Snowy!

244
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.

245
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,700
He's lying. He must have the scroll.

246
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,100
- The question is, what has
he done with it? - 

247
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,700
I want you to go back down there
and make him talk.

248
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,700
- Break every bone in his body,
if you have to. - Oh, that's nasty.

249
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,800
You know the stakes. You know
what we're playing for. Just do it.

250
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,700
Mr. Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!

251
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,200
- It's a disaster, the captain
has come around. - What?

252
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
He is conscious.
He is accusing you of mutiny.

253
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
He says you've turned the
crew against him.

254
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
- Silly fool he's sobered up again.
- Well don't just stand there.

255
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,800
- Get him another bottle.
- Right sir.

256
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,200
- Take to the left. It is just stuck.
- Take a look.

257
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,400
What are you doing?
Get the hell off.

258
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,100
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bunged it from the inside.

259
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,600
Do you want to play
like that then, Tintin?

260
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,400
Get the TNT.

261
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Broken crates, broken,
champagne.

262
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
What else do we have Snowy?

263
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,300
There are other ways to open this door.

264
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,900
They'll be swabbing the decks with your innards
when we done with you.

265
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
Give it here!

266
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
- Don't move.
- What!

267
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,100
Let's go.

268
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,300
He's got a big machine gun -- I've been shot !!!!

269
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,600
Hold your fire.

270
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,400
He aint here - he's vanished.

271
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,900
He's hiding. Search the ship.

272
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Quickly.

273
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Ahh a giant rat through the scuttle

274
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,500
So you thought you'd sneak in behind me and catch
me with my trousers down uhh!!!

275
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
I'd rather you kept your trousers on,
If it's all the same to you

276
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,400
- I know your game. You're one of those ---
- Sorry?

277
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
- They sent you here to kill me.
- I don't know who you are!

278
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
That's how he has planned
to bump me off.

279
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Murdered in my bed by a baby face assassin.

280
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,000
Assassin! You got it all wrong.
I was kidnapped.

281
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,600
By gang of thugs.

282
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Oh the filthy swine

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,900
- He has turned all the crew
against me! - Who?

284
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Sour faced man with the sugary name.
He's bought them all off. Every one.

285
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Sakharine!

286
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,500
Nobody takes my ship.

287
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,100
- You're the captain? - Course I'm
the captain who else can I be?

288
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I've been locked in
this room for days.

289
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,300
With only whiskey to
sustain my mortal soul.

290
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,400
- I assumed that was locked.
- Well, it is not.

291
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Now you must excuse me. If they find
me here they will kill me.

292
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,700
I've to keep moving. Try and find my way
out of this drunken tub.

293
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Tub?

294
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,900
Tub.

295
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,000
TUB!

296
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,600
Thanks. Hold him.

297
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,900
- I'm Tintin by the way.
- Haddock. Archibald Haddock.

298
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,500
-There's a long boat on deck. Follow me .
- Wait a second, did you say Haddock?

299
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,600
How could you let them escape?
Find them. Find them both.

300
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,500
- Don't worry, we will kill them, sir.
- No,

301
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,600
...you can kill the boy,
not Haddock.

302
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,200
He is just a hopeless old drunk, we
should've killed him long ago.

303
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,600
You think it is an accident
that I chose Haddock's ship

304
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,900
...Haddock's crew, Haddock's
treacherous first mate...

305
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,900
Nothing is an accident.

306
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,600
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock, and I.

307
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
We have unfinished business.

308
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,800
And this time I'm going
to make him pay.

309
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,300
We have to reach the locked
door at the end of this corridor.

310
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
This is gonna be tricky.

311
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,000
you wouldn't happen to be related to
Haddock's Marlinspike Hall. Would you?

312
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,400
- Why do you ask? - That's the
story I've been working on.

313
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,000
You know the shipwrech which happened off the
coast of Barbados.

314
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,100
A man-o-war triple-masted, 50 Guns.

315
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,200
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- not a lot, that's why I am asking you.

316
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,300
The secret of that ship belongs to my family.

317
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,300
It has been passed out from
generation to generation.

318
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,800
My Grandfdaddy himself with his
dying breath told me that they all...

319
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,400
- And ...
- Gone.

320
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,600
What do you mean "gone"?

321
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
I was so upset that he kicked the
bucket, I've no choice but to drown my sorrows

322
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,300
When I woke up in the morning
it was gone. I had forgotten all.

323
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
- Everything?
- Every last word.

324
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,200
But is there somebody else in your family
May be they would help.

325
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,500
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed

326
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,600
I am the last of the Haddocks.

327
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,200
Did you say three sons?

328
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,200
What was that?

329
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
No, there is nothing here.

330
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,100
- I know what Sakharine is looking for.
- What you reeling on about?

331
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,200
It was written on the scroll.

332
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,600
Three brothers joined three
Unicorns in company...

333
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,800
...sailing in the noonday
sun will speak.

334
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,200
- Really? - Sir Francis did not
make two models of the unicorn

335
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,100
He made three.
Three ships for three sons.

336
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Excellent.

337
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,900
Sakharine is after the
third model of the ship.

338
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,100
- Barnacles, someone has locked
the door. - Is there a key?

339
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
A key ?

340
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Yes, that'll be a problem.

341
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,700
Mr. Jaggerman. Top bunk in the
center. Keeper of the keys.

342
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,700
Careful mate, he is a restless sleeper .
On account of the tragic loss of his eyelids!

343
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,500
He lost his eyelids?
Aye that was a card game to remember

344
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,900
Oh you really had to be there!

345
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,300
Would do it myself, but you are a lighter
and less chance of waking the boy

346
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,300
- I'm not sure this is a Good idea?
- You have nothing to worry about...

347
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,000
...provided they all stay asleep.

348
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I would not get too close to Mr. Hobbsin.
He is very handy with a razor.

349
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,200
And steer clear of Mr. Kitzist.

350
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,700
Sacked from a ship on account
of his animal husbandry.

351
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,700
Not the sandwich. The Keys!

352
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,600
You are the brave one, Tintin.

353
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,000
My heart was in my mouth,
don't mind telling you.

354
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,000
That is if was my heart, judging by my
stomach ache could have been anything

355
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,600
Hurry up, Captain,
we have no time to lose.

356
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,300
Ohhho! Just the necessities of course.

357
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,900
The life boat.

358
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,900
Nothing yet, watch it sir.
The boss says he is a handful.

359
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,300
Come on.

360
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
- It is Allan.
- Is that  the bridge?

361
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,500
Aye. On the other side
of the radio room.

362
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,600
Radio room? Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone Comes.

363
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Be Careful, Tintin.

364
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
- This message has just come through boss.
- What's it say?

365
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:32,400
"The Milanese Nightingale has Landed,
waiting in the wings for action"

366
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,800
- Milanese Nightingale..
- just pray this cheers him up

367
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
Bagghar.

368
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,600
What is this?
The Sultanate of Bagghar

369
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,400
Ruled over by Sheikh
Omar Ben Salaad.

370
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,900
His love of music and culture
is matched only by his love of...

371
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,900
GREAT SNAKES!

372
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
Bagghar.

373
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,600
The port of Bagghar.
In Morocco.

374
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,400
Tintin!

375
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Hey! Put your hands up.

376
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,800
And let that be a lesson to ya

377
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,000
Help me !

378
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Here! Here!

379
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,500
Here! by the lifeboats

380
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,400
After him.

381
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,700
- Over there!
- Boy you ...

382
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,400
He's up there.

383
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,200
- Turn this ship!
- Aye Sir.

384
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Get down!

385
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,300
- There he is.
- Get outta the way.

386
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,900
Go! Full ahead!
Full speed!

387
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,800
- I Got You.
- Stay low.

388
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Look down there.

389
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,700
- Idiots! You idiot what have you done?
- We killed them boss, like you wanted.

390
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,100
No! not like I wanted.
I needed Haddock alive.

391
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,400
Wait a minute boss.
There were two boats missing.

392
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,500
yeah the other one must have been a decoy

393
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,200
They are on to us,
and our destination.

394
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,200
Find them. Make absolutely certain
they never reach Bagghar

395
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,800
- We have to get to Bagghar ahead of
Sakharine. - I know! I know!

396
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,100
- Why? - Because he has
the third model of ship.

397
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,500
How do you know?

398
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,500
The Sheikh collects old ships, and
this is the prize of his collection.

399
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,000
Blistering barnacles!
That is the Unicorn.

400
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,000
- Captain, do you see the distortion
around the model? - I can see.

401
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,300
It means, in Bin Salaad exhibits
are going to be in a...

402
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,400
bullet proof glass
case in his palace.

403
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
- Sakharine is going there to steal it.
- He Has a Secret Weapon.

404
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,600
The Milanese Nightingale.. But that
won't be enough to solve the mystery,

405
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,000
and, that's why, Sakharine needs you.

406
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,400
That is why he made you his prisoner.

407
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,400
There is something he needs
you to remember.

408
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't follow you.

409
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,700
I read it in a book,

410
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,400
that only a true Haddock can
discover the secret of the Unicorn.

411
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,300
I don't remember anything about anything

412
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,000
But you must know that your ancestors
Sir Francis - it's your family legacy.

413
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,300
- My memory is not the way it used
to be. - What did it used to be?

414
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,400
I've forgotten.

415
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,000
Captain, can you get us to Bagghar?

416
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,800
What sort of stupid question Is that?

417
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Gimme those oars! Now you'll see some
real seamenship buddy.

418
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,700
I'll not be hounded by some pipsqueak ginger
and his irritating dof

419
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,600
I am Master and Commander of the seas.

420
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,400
I know these waters better than
the warts on my mother's face.

421
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Look at the pair of them.
Fast asleep.

422
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,500
Typical landlubbers. have no stamina these days

423
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,000
Never mind. I get take you there Tintin.

424
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,900
Look Thomson, that's the fellow.

425
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,200
Oh my!

426
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
- Mr. Silk.
- Yes?

427
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,000
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson

428
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,900
- We are police officers.
- Oh!

429
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,700
Mr. Silk. Are you Ok?

430
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,800
Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right, sir.

431
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,100
- No need to runaway sir.
- No.. no, you see.

432
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,200
Yesterday we nearly we
caught the pickpocket...

433
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,900
who has been terrorizing the town.

434
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,600
Pickpocket? -- We pulled his jacket off and
inside we found the wallet.

435
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,200
- A wallet with your name and address.
- That's my wallet.

436
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,700
- Well, it's obvious he has stole
it from you. - No that's my wallet

437
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,600
Are you all right, sir?
We didn't mean to startle you.

438
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Let us help you into your apartment?

439
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,600
Thank you so much. Don't need to come
in, I'll be quite all right

440
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,400
We insist, it's better to be safe than
sorry. Its least we can do

441
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,000
- Oh, thank you.
- Here we are.

442
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,400
- Good grief what's all this?
- It is my collection.

443
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,100
- What a lot of wallets.
- I can't help it.

444
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,100
It started with coin purses.
and went on from there really

445
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,200
You ought to be careful. Haven't you
heard, there is a pickpocket around.

446
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,000
- Yes. Can you imagine.
- What do you mean pick pocket?

447
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,100
A Master Criminal. A bag snatching,
purse pilfering, wallet lifting thief.

448
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm not a bad person.
I am a kleptomaniac.

449
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,500
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.

450
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,400
No wonder, he keeps his
wallets in the living room.

451
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,000
Wallets! I just cannot resist
the lovely little things.

452
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,500
It Is a harmless little habit, really.

453
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,900
- Look at this. His name is Thomson too
- What a coincidence.

454
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,400
No Thompson.
This is Thomson without a "p".

455
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,700
No.. no.. no. Its Thompson with a "p"

456
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,500
[all rambling together] 

457
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm not your sidekick, you are mine.

458
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,800
- How dare you?
- How dare you?

459
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,000
- I met you first.
- I met you first

460
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,700
I can't stand it anymore.

461
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Take them! Take them!
Take them all!

462
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,600
Pull yourself together man.
We can't take your wallets.

463
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,200
- Do we look like thieves?
- Good heavens Thompson.

464
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,700
This looks familiar. Tell me.

465
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,100
This is Tintins.

466
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,200
Oh, I'm so cold....

467
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,500
...and thirsty.

468
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,700
My thoat is parched - I'll see if there is any
fresh water.

469
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,400
ahhh what have we here?

470
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,300
Tintin! Tintin!

471
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,100
Come and warm yourself buddy.

472
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,400
Captain, what have you done?

473
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,000
- No Need to thank me.
- What?

474
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,900
You looked a little cold
so I lit a wee fire

475
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,100
In a boat? No, those are our oars.
We need them.

476
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,400
- Yes but not for much longer.
- Have you gone mad?

477
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,600
Quick, Captain. Help me.
Captain help me quick.

478
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,000
Ohh what have I done, what've I done

479
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,200
No. Captain, not that.

480
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,800
Thundering typhoons

481
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,200
This is a fine mess.
Weak, selfish!!!

482
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,100
There is no hope of rescue. Sakharine
and his men are half way to Bagghar.

483
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,300
- Oh! Miserable! Rats!
- All right, that's enough of that.

484
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,400
That was his fault, you see.
It was Sir Francis's.

485
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,200
- Tell me, how did you work that one out?
- Because he was a figurehead of great courage...

486
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,500
bold exploits, no one like that ever
existed in my family.

487
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,600
Why do you think I drink, because
I know, I'll never be like him.

488
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,300
No it's far better I end it now
Put us both out of our misery

489
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,000
What is it, Snowy?

490
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,200
I'm going to lower
myself into the sea.

491
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,100
Into the cold embrace.
The big blue.....

492
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,300
Those are Portuguese markings.
Where is the Karaboudjan registered?

493
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,200
We are saved! We are saved!

494
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,200
We are saved!

495
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,700
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.

496
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:48,200
The slave traders! mutant malingerers!!!

497
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,400
Freshwater politicians!

498
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,500
Bad news, captain.
We only got one bullet.

499
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,700
- Oh, what's the good news?
- We got one bullet.

500
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,600
You got him!

501
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,100
Well shot boy.

502
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,200
Stay here, Captain.

503
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,000
Tintin! Tintin!

504
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,500
Don't take your eyes
off of them. Hurry up.

505
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,300
just as I thought.
Ignition has been cut.

506
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,900
A lucky shot. One more pass
and we will finish him off.

507
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,900
Put your hands in the air.

508
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,300
Now!

509
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,200
Let's see.

510
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
You know what you are doing, Tintin?

511
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,100
More or less.

512
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,000
- Which is it more --- or less.
- Relax.

513
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,600
I interviewed a pilot once?

514
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,300
Which way to North Africa?

515
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,300
Captain, look,
we've caught up with them.

516
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,900
Wonderful. Would you think I might
find another way to North Africa?

517
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,500
that doesn't take us through that wall of death?

518
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,400
We can't turn back.
Not now. Not now.

519
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,900
No, Captain. That's surgical spirit
for medicinal purposes only.

520
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,100
[muttering]

521
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,200
Fuel tank. It's almost empty.

522
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,500
Captain, This may sound crazy,
but I have got a plan.

523
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,200
The alcohol in the bottle
may go a few more miles.

524
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,200
I need you to climb out of the plane
and pour it into the fuel tank.

525
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,800
Can I put on the parachute first?

526
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,300
It's a terrible storm out there.

527
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,900
- And it's raining.
- And you call yourself a Haddock?

528
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,500
Captain?

529
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,800
Captain, can you hear me?
Captain?

530
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,200
You're doing fine.
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.

531
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,900
We're running on fumes...

532
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,400
Fuuuuumes...

533
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,400
- Captain, I can't see!
- Land! Land!

534
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,400
- We cant land !
- We're not there yet

535
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,100
Do something!

536
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,700
Hold on, Tintin!

537
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,800
I'm coming!

538
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,200
The land of thirst -- the land of thirst.

539
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,200
- Land of thirst
- Oh will you stop saying that..

540
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,500
You don't understand, I've run out.

541
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,600
- You do not know, what that means.
- Captain, we have to keep going.

542
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,700
One step at a time.
Come on, on your feet.

543
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,200
Lean your weight on me.

544
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,300
A man can only handle so long without his vitals

545
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,200
Captain, calm down. There are
worse things than sobering up?

546
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,900
Look, Tintin do you see it?

547
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,500
Water! Water!

548
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,200
Captain, just a mirage.

549
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,300
It was here. I saw it.

550
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,000
It was just your mind playing
tricks. It's the heat.

551
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,600
- I have to go home.
- What?

552
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:08,300
- I have to go back to the sea.
- Captain, you're Hallucinating.

553
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,900
Look at that. Did you ever
see a more beautiful sight?

554
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,300
She is turning into the wind.
All sails set.

555
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,800
Triple-masted, double decks.

556
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,600
- Fifty guns.
- The Unicorn?

557
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,900
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes she is.

558
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,100
Tell me captain,
what else can you see?

559
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:38,700
She's got the wind behind her. Look
at the pace she is setting.

560
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,400
Barely a day out of Barbados.

561
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,000
Hold full of rum, and finest
tobacco -

562
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,700
and the heart of sailors
set for home.

563
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,700
The Red Pennant.

564
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,100
The blood runs cold in every sea
captain who looks upon that flag

565
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,300
they know they're facing a fight to the death.

566
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,000
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.

567
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,500
And Haddocks don't flee.

568
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Battle stations!

569
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,600
Never seen so many....

570
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,200
Yellow bellied, lilly-livered sea slugs

571
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,500
- Prepare to bring her about.
- Aye, aye, captain.

572
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,200
Prepare to bring her about!

573
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,700
- Mr. Nichols, secure the cargo.
- Right away sir.

574
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,000
Prepare to repel boarders!

575
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,600
Destroy. We need more men.

576
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,800
Then he saw him.

577
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,400
Like a phantom!!.
Rising from the dead.!!

578
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,100
Who, captain?

579
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,100
Who did he see?

580
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,500
The ship is gone.

581
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,900
What do you mean gone?
What happened next?

582
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,300
Oh Jupiter I have beard!!!
Since when did I have a beard?

583
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:26,200
Something Happened on the Unicorn.
It is the key to everything.

584
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,200
- You must try to remember.
- Unicorn ... I'm so terribly thirsty.

585
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,700
- Captain! - Tintin,
what's happening to me?

586
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,900
And to think,
all it took was a day in the Sahara.

587
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,800
Congratulations captain,
you are sober.

588
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,700
Sober.

589
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Good dog.

590
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,100
- This one is all right.
Check the other! - Yes, sir!

591
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,200
I am Lieutenant Delcourt. Welcome
to the Afgharin fortress.

592
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,400
Thank you, Lieutenant.
We owe you our lives.

593
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,500
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he is not in good shape.

594
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,400
He is still suffering the effects
of acute dehydration.

595
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,900
He is quite Delirious. Why don't we pay
him a visit.

596
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, Haddock, you're awake.
Good. I have a visitor for you.

597
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,600
- Captain.
- Ooohh I think you've got the wrong room.

598
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,700
Captain, it is Tintin. Our plane crashed
in the desert. Don't you remember?

599
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,200
Plane? Oh no, I'm a naval man myself.

600
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,700
I'll never fly, if I can help it. He is
confused with someone else.

601
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,200
What is this peculiar liquid?

602
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,400
- There's no bouquet - Its completely transparent.
- Ah, its water.

603
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,600
What will they think of next?

604
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,400
We suspect, he has concussion.

605
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,000
- From what he's drinking - its delirium.
- He is sober!

606
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,600
- Now captain, out in the desert.
- Desert? - Yes.

607
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,100
- you were talking about Sir Francis.
- Sir who? - Sir Francis.

608
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,200
- and you were telling me about what
happened on the Unicorn...

609
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,400
- The Unicorn!
- Yes.

610
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,000
AAhh the stuff that dreams are made of
wee chidrens dreams

611
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,200
No, the ship. Please try
to remember captain.

612
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,200
Lives are at risk

613
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,400
Snowy, what have you done?

614
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,500
Stand back, if I were you.

615
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,900
He's snapped.
Everybody out of this room.

616
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,900
Show yourself Red Rackham!

617
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,600
if it's a fight you want
you'll be eating rats...

618
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:22,100
- Fighting with who?
- To the death, Red Rackham.

619
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,600
No, wait.

620
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,700
Wait. Captain.

621
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,100
I remember everything now,
everything granddaddy told me.

622
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:01,400
The Unicorn was taken
Pirates were now masters of the ship.

623
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,000
- Our crew surrendered?
- granddaddy said that Red Rackham.

624
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,700
called Sir Francis the 'Kings dog'

625
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,400
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim their hard fought plunder.

626
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,400
Why would I waste my time on rum,
tobacco, molasses and dates, -

627
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,400
When you have a more
valuable cargo on board?

628
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,500
- Where is it?
- You have to kill me first.

629
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,700
Not at first. No.

630
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,100
I'll start with the your men!

631
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:38,800
To save his men, he would give
up the secret cargo.

632
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,400
Where was it?

633
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Four hundred pounds in weight of gold
and jewels and treasure

634
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,600
- Kill His men!
- No, Rackham. No!

635
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,400
You gave me your word.
Rackham! Rackham!

636
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,700
Sir Francis knew he was doomed, -

637
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,400
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm

638
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,000
But they didn't reckon on one thing.

639
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,500
Sir Francis was a Haddock.

640
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,800
And a Haddock always
has a trick up his sleeve.

641
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,200
And with that he hurls
himself forward!

642
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,300
On the pirates, like that, unarmed.

643
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,300
No. there was a bottle of rum rolling
on the deck, and he opens it up.

644
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,600
- And he lifts it to his lips ...
- Then then he stops.

645
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,100
This is no time for drinking, he says,
I need all my wits about me.

646
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,800
with that he puts down the bottle and ...

647
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,600
Yes, yes, yes. He puts down the
bottle ... And seizes a cutlass!

648
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,600
He makes his way to
the ships magazine...

649
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,200
where they keep all the
gunpowder and the shot.

650
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,700
You dog! you'd blow us sky high?

651
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,000
Well come on then let's have you.

652
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,300
Not this time.

653
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,900
You!

654
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,300
Captain, what is it?

655
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,500
How can I be so blind?

656
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
What are you talking about?

657
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,500
This isn't just about the scrolls or....

658
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,700
the treasure that went
down with the ship.

659
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,200
it's me!!

660
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,700
It's me he is after.

661
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,900
You'll suffer a curse upon you
and your name Haddock.

662
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,400
He wants vengeance.

663
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,800
Come back and face me.

664
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,300
- Hurry Tintin. We are out of time.
- Captain!

665
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,700
I curse you. I curse your name...

666
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:55,400
...and all who come after!
We will meet again, Haddock!

667
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:59,600
In another time,
in another life.

668
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,900
- It's not over, it was never over
- I don't understand. Who's after your blood?

669
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,300
- Sakharine.
- Sakharine? Why?

670
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,600
He is a Red Rackham's descendent.
He needs to finish it.

671
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:31,000
That's why he did it --- Did What?
Sank his own ship.

672
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,300
Sir Francis sent that treasure
to the bottom of the sea.

673
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,000
- He would be damned before he let
Red Rackham have it. - And he was.

674
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,600
- But he couldn't let it lie.
- No. - He left the clue.

675
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,500
Three clues wrapped in a riddle
concealing the secret.

676
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,100
- But only a true Haddock will
be able to solve it. - A secret?

677
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,600
The location... to one of the greatest
sunken treasures in all history.

678
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,100
The wreck of the Unicorn .

679
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:56,500
He means to steal it.
The third scroll.

680
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,400
Blue blistering barnacles!

681
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,500
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him.

682
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,800
- To Bagghar.
- To Bagghar.

683
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,800
He is here.

684
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:55,300
It's no good. It could be anywhere.

685
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,800
Captain, don't look now,
but we are being followed.

686
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,700
So we are.

687
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,300
What do you want?
Why are you following us?

688
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,900
Who are you working for?

689
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,400
Captain, stop---stop!

690
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,500
- Thomson and Thompson. - Don't
say it now. - We are in disguise.

691
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,300
Oh, I see. You got the message
I sent from the ship

692
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,900
Yes. Bit of a long story there.

693
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,000
The upshot is we caught the thief, retrieved your wallet,
and hopped on the next plane to Bagghar.

694
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,800
That pocket picker has
picked his last pocket.

695
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,700
Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.

696
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,200
It's not the money I'm worried about.

697
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,600
The odds are even

698
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,800
Now to find the next two scrolls.

699
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,300
The Milanese Nightingale.

700
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,300
That's his secret weapon.

701
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,600
Aye.

702
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:16,800
Welcome, Madame Castafiore.

703
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,400
We are blessed with
your presence.

704
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:23,800
Oh, yes. Indeed, Senore Salaad.

705
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,400
What charming peasants.

706
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,200
May I introduce my escort.

707
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,900
Mr. Sugar Addatif.

708
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,500
He has been a very...

709
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,600
...passionate supporter
of this concert.

710
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,800
It's my first visit to the third world.

711
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:48,700
Please forgive me. I must escort Madam
to the dressing room. Excuse me.

712
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,800
Bravo.

713
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,500
After you.

714
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,200
Captain, I want you to look after this.
What are you doing?

715
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,300
- Me? - Yes
- Are you sure?

716
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,900
If I'm caught, I don't want
him to find this on me.

717
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,900
- Just keep it in.
- I will guard this with my life.

718
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,900
Get up!

719
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,400
It's her.

720
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,700
Blistering barnacles!

721
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,100
What's that noise?

722
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,400
My ears.

723
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,900
- They are bleeding.
- No, they are not.

724
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,100
Captain!

725
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,700
Shut up, Snowy.

726
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,500
........make way - medical emergency

727
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,600
That was close

728
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,200
- Hello, Captain.
- You!

729
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,300
Sakharine.

730
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,600
- Stop him, Snowy!
- Tintin!

731
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,600
- Those two there, they're here to steal your ship!
- No. no. we are not!

732
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,200
- Arrest him and the ugly one!
- Who? Me?

733
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,100
Yes. Arrest him.

734
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,500
Captain!

735
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,600
- Sakharine's got the scroll.
- It's worse than that mate

736
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,800
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll too.

737
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,100
- Its gone.
- How? What happened?

738
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:01,900
It was Allan. He nobbled me...
in the garden and...

739
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,900
- Then there was a bottle of alcohol.
- There always is.

740
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,800
No! No, no. It's not like that.

741
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,500
I can smell it on you.

742
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,600
Hurry. Back to the boat.

743
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,200
- Tintin, where are you going?
- Going after Sakharine.

744
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,300
- By yourself?
- Yes. Come on, Snowy.

745
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,900
Lose them!
Get him off our tail.

746
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,100
Did you hit anything?

747
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,000
Faster. You idiot, faster.

748
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,000
I'll take those thank you.

749
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,000


750
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,500
Faster!

751
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,100
- Captain, let's go!
- You don't worry.

752
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,400
on three!

753
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,700
Snowy!

754
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,200
Oh no! Not again.

755
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,500
Come here my beauty.

756
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,500
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
I'll kill you if I find you!

757
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,800
Captain, the bird! Grab it!

758
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,400
Great work, Snowy! l Now don't let it go.

759
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,900
Blistering barnacles!

760
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,600
Snowy, I am coming!

761
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,900
Slow down.

762
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,400
That's right! That's right! Come
to daddy! Come to dadd....

763
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,400
Gotcha. Come on.

764
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,400
No!

765
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,300
Geronimo!

766
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,300


767
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,800


768
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:50,300
The scrolls are lining up.
these are hidden numbers.

769
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:56,200
- What does it say?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you!

770
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,200
Let the bird go.

771
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,300
What do you value more.
Those scrolls or Haddock's life?

772
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,500
Don't listen to him.

773
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,700
You will never get away with this
..you sour- faced sassanach

774
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,700
I will kill him.

775
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:13,200
- Don't worry about me, Tintin...I'm fine
- Let the bird go now...

776
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,000
- Or this man dies!
- No! Wait!

777
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,900
You two timing troglodyte

778
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,000
Perhaps we should put it to test?
Here's mud in your eye

779
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,700
Tintin!

780
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,800
Oh! We are saved!

781
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,000
- I love the beach.
- You said you wanted a holiday.

782
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,900
- Nobody takes my ship! -
- They've already taken it.

783
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,400
But nobody takes my ship twice.

784
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,800
We'll show 'em hey then Tintin.
Right what's the plan?

785
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,100
- There is no plan. - Of course there's a plan.
You always got a plan.

786
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:23,900
Not this time. Sakharine has the scrolls,
They lead him to the treasure.

787
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,700
He could be anywhere in the world.
We will never see him again.

788
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,600
It's over.

789
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,800
I thought you were an optimist.

790
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,300
You were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.

791
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:41,000
- That's just another name for a quitter.
- You can call me what you like.

792
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:44,300
Don't you get it? We failed.

793
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,400
Failed?

794
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,200
There are plenty of others
willing to call me a failure.

795
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,500
A fool, a loser, a hopeless souse.

796
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:58,200
Don't you ever say that yourself!

797
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,100
You send out the wrong signal,
that is what people pick up.

798
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:08,300
You understand? If you care about
something, you fight for it.

799
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,600
You hit a wall, you push through it.

800
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:17,000
There's something you need to
know about failure Tintin.

801
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
It can never let you free

802
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,600
- What did you just say?
- You hit a wall, you push through it!

803
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,600
No, no, you said something
about sending out the signal.

804
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,600
Of course! Captain,

805
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:39,400
I sent a radio message
from the Karaboudjan.

806
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,300
I know what radio frequency
they are transmitting on.

807
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,800
Well, how does that help us?

808
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,100
All we have to do is send that
information to Interpol,

809
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,400
they can track the signals and figure
out which way they are headed.

810
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,900
- And here come Interpol now.
- Tintin!

811
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,600
Any port they enter,
we will know at once.

812
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,200
We can get there first.

813
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,400
What are we doing here boss, I don't get it
We're right back where we started

814
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,300
Speak of this to no one. Keep your
mouth shut.

815
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,300
Don't worry, as long
as we get our share.

816
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,000
- Oh you'll get your share.
- Where are you going?

817
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,700
Guard the ship.

818
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,700
Good evening, sir. I trust you had
a successful trip abroad.

819
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,200
Do I pay you to talk to me?

820
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,600
You don't pay me at all.

821
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,000
This place is messed up.

822
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,000
Nestor!

823
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:41,100
Tom! Allan! you blithering idiots.....
Don't just stand there -- do something!

824
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,900
Caught him like a rat in a trap.

825
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,700
Congratulations, Gentlemen.
He's all yours.

826
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,600
Yes. We also have an arrest warrant
issued by both Interpol and the FBI.

827
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,700
Your friend who got shot --- Barnaby?

828
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,600
He was one of their agents. Right on
Sakharine's trail from the start.

829
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,500
It still doesn't make sense. He has the
key to the treasure of the Unicorn.

830
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,000
Which is sitting somewhere
on the ocean floor.

831
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,500
Why would he come back home?

832
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,600
Right, Sakharine.

833
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,700
That's Mr. Sakharine to you.

834
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,700
Hold it.

835
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,600
Allan! Get me down.

836
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,000
Not that way!

837
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,000
Not that way, you fool!
The other way!

838
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,100
Right!!

839
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,700
Look out!

840
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,300
Close but no cigar!!!

841
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,700
- Red Rackham !
- That's right. My ancestor.

842
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,100
- Just as Sir Francis was yours.
- It's unfinished business.

843
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,000
Oh I'm glad you know
the truth, Haddock.

844
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,600
Until you could remember....killing you,
wouldn't have been this much fun.

845
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,000
- Who gave you permission to
board my ship? - I don't need it.

846
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,800
I've never needed it.

847
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:27,300
The legend says, only a Haddock can
discover The Secret of the Unicorn.

848
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,900
It took a Rackham
to get the job done.

849
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,500
So you've lost again, Haddock.

850
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:39,100
That's right! Why don't you have a
drink? It's all you got left! Isn't it?

851
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,900
Everything which was rightfully
yours, is now mine.

852
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,600
Including the ship.

853
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:55,400
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.

854
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,100
We have you now, you devil.

855
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:19,200
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise.......

856
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,500
you are under arrest.

857
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,500
Do you see?

858
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,200
Blistering barnacles!
They're coordinates.

859
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,500
It took all three scrolls
to form the numbers.

860
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:48,900
Latitude and longitude, that is it.
That's the location of the treasure.

861
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,400
We did it!

862
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,400
Almost there, Mr. Tintin.

863
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,000
- Next to starboard should do it
- Are you sure we are on course?

864
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:16,300
Stay laddie I know these parts like
the back of my hand.

865
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,900
- Starboard! quick!
- Quickly!

866
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,000
All stop!!!

867
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:39,100
Marlinspike Hall

868
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,900
Those coordinates lead here.

869
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,100
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?

870
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,000
I thought the treasure
went down with the ship.

871
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,500
Master Haddock, Mr. Tintin,
I've been expecting you.

872
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:58,400
- Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
- Look at this place!

873
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,300
I don't think it's changed at all
since I was a little boy.

874
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,800
and may I say sir,

875
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,600
How much I'm looking forward to having
a Haddock back in charge of the estate.

876
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,200
You will be waiting a long time, Nestor.

877
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,900
There is no way I could
afford to live here.

878
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,300
Well, Captain, you know the house.
Where do we start?

879
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,300
Is the cellar still here?

880
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,400
No, no no, no this isn't it.

881
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,800
- I meant the other cellar.
- I'm sorry sir there is no other cellar.

882
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,100
- It was bigger than this.
- Snowy!

883
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,700
Snowy, where are you?

884
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,200
Snowy.

885
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,100
Just like you said, Captain.

886
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:07,800
- You hit a wall ...
- You push through it.

887
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,600
My grandfather must have walled it
up before he lost the house.

888
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:18,900
'and then shines forth the Eagle's cross'.

889
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,700
I can see the cross but where's the eagle ?

890
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,300
St. John Evangelist, who is always
depicted with an eagle.

891
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:37,200
And he is called the eagle of
Patmos. He is the eagle.

892
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,500
What he trying to tell us, Captain?
I'm at a loss.

893
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,500
The island, the one in the middle,
that doesn't exist.

894
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,100
- How do you know?
- Because I sailed those waters.

895
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,400
countless times I've been there.
That is a mistake.

896
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,100
What if it isn't?

897
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:04,500
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of it.

898
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:09,800
A man like himself, who knows
the seas like the back of his hand.

899
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,000
A man who could look at a globe

900
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:18,300
...and tell if one tiny
island is out of place.

901
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:36,600
Blistering treasure, it is
Red Rackham's barnacles!

902
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,900
What is this?

903
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:29,700
Just a wee tipple, a toast to our good fortune.

904
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,400
Now that's better.

905
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,100
It's odd, you would have thought, after all the
fuss and bother there would have been more

906
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,800
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.

907
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,700
By your account he looted half of
South America. I just thought ...

908
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:46,000
Ach never mind there's plenty to go around

909
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:52,300
Ohh. it's a funny old life. Now you got
your story for your newspaper!

910
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:56,300
- All is well that ends well
- It's not ended.

911
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,500
Sir Francis left another clue,
at the bottom of the globe.

912
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:03,200
- Clue to what?
- Four hundred weight of gold...

913
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,800
...just lying at the bottom of the sea.

914
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,700
How is your thirst for adventure,..Captain?

915
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,600
Unquenchable, Tintin.
