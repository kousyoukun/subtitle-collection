1
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,660
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,550
the Peacocks ruled over the Gongmen city.

3
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,710
They brought great joy and prosperity to the city,

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,720
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,110
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,060
saw darker path in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,610
What that brought color and joy,

8
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,730
could also brink darkness and destruction.

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,820
Shen's troubled parents consulted to Soothsayer.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,360
She foretold that if Shen continued down to this dark path,

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,690
he will be defeated by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,270
The Young Lord set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,540
But what he did next, only sealed it.

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,220
Shen returned to his parents full of pride.

15
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,900
But in their faces, he saw only horror.

16
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,220
He was banished from the city forever.

17
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,630
But Shen swore revenge.

18
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,270
Some day, he will return,

19
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,270
and all of China would bow at his feet.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
It's almost done, Lord Shen. But we ran out of metal.

21
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,950
Search the furthest villages, find more metal.

22
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,700
China will be mine.

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,580
And then the Dragon warrior joined the Furious five.

24
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,610
So they became the most awesome Kung Fu team ever.

25
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,130
Enough talk. Let's fight.

26
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,510
Listen, listen! You can hear the Dragon warrior training right now.

27
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,700
Thirty-three, stop him. It's too dangerous.

28
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,500
Thirty-five.

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,080
- Stay focus.  - Thirty-six.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,280
Thirty-seven.

31
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,430
How is he doing that to his face?

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
Thirty-eight bean buns.

33
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,550
Yes. New record. You monster.

34
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,070
- Keep going, hit forty.  - He never hit forty.

35
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,450
You got it, buddy. I'm going to forty!

36
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,500
- Do it.  - No problem.

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,720
Wait a moment.

38
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,370
- He did it.  - Well done Po.

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
Your training is paid off.

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,370
Oh, Master Shifu. Gotta go. See you later.

41
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,890
You'll save those to me, right?

42
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,240
Inner peace.

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,400
Inner peace.

44
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,420
Oh. Inner peace.

45
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,030
Master Shifu.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Master Shifu. What do we got? Pirates?

47
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,930
Vandals of volcano mountain?

48
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,930
Whatever it is I will take them down. Cuz I'm in the mood.

49
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,900
I need to get something done, you know what I mean?

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
What are you doing?

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,540
One of Master Oogways' final teachings.

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
Awesome. How did you do that?

53
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,410
- Inner peace.  - Inner peace. That's cool!

54
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,690
- Inner peace of what?  - It's the next phase of your training.

55
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,450
Every master must find his path to inner peace.

56
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,850
Some chose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this.

57
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Without the slightest taste of food or water.

58
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,910
- Or?  - Some find it through pain and suffering as I did.

59
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,750
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior,

60
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,110
was the worst day of my life.

61
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,350
By far, nothing else came close.

62
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,850
- It was the world's most painful, mind destroying, horrible moment,  - Okay.

63
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,370
I have ever experienced.

64
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,710
But once I realized the problem was not you, but within me,

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,920
I found inner peace, and was able to harness the flow of the universe.

66
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,940
So that's it. I just need inner peace?

67
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,460
My inner is already super-super peaceful.

68
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,000
So all I need to do is just get this thing going.

69
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,390
Inner peace. You're going down.

70
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,820
Now show me what you were doing there with your feet. I saw you just sort of a fancy...

71
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Po!

72
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,810
Bandits, approaching the musicians' village.

73
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,620
Danger. Tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on.

74
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,620
Don't worry Shifu, I will master inner peace, as soon as I get back.

75
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,540
No snack stops this time.

76
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,760
Ha-ha-ha! Snack stops.

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,000
Wait, are you serious?

78
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,310
Get all the metal you can find.

79
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,350
Grab the metal.

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
Help, help, help.

81
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,340
That's everything. Let's get out of here.

82
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,190
Wings of justice.

83
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,480
The Dragon Warrior.

84
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,380
Panda? That's impossible.

85
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,030
My fist hungers for justice.

86
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
That was my... fist.

87
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
Get them.

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,500
Come on.

89
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,350
Take that.

90
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,300
Po, incoming.

91
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,270
Thanks, Mantis.

92
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,940
Tigress, double-jump strike.

93
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
Feet of fury!

94
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,550
Tigress.

95
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,450
Monkey. Viper.

96
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,510
Mantis. Bunny. What?

97
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,510
Oh sorry.

98
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,910
- Crane, go.  - I'm on it.

99
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,810
Is everyone OK?

100
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,980
Awesome!

101
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,090
I got this.

102
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,210
Shoo on that, Toby!

103
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,310
- Are you okay?  - What happened?

104
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
I think I saw.

105
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,190
I think...

106
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,780
I gotta go.

107
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,050
Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

108
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,380
More tea? Lemon sauce? If you need anything, just ask.

109
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,940
Thank you.

110
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,900
Dragon Warrior's mop. He might be very poor.

111
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,030
No touching, you'll get the mop dirty.

112
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,690
- He was waiting on me.  - Awesome.

113
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,530
I have a stand to prove it. Hey. Where is the Dragon Warrior?

114
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,090
He does not work here anymore.

115
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,790
He's busy out there. Protecting the valley.

116
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,460
- The Dragon Warrior.  - Po.

117
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,220
Here, OK.

118
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,470
You should have told me you were coming.

119
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,760
Hi dad.

120
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,730
- I would save you some stinky tofu.  - Ah.

121
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,970
- Ah, can I talk to you?  - Of course, son.

122
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,730
In honor of my son: Free tofu desserts for everybody...

123
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,030
with purchases.

124
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,800
So good to see you. Po.

125
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,080
Have you lost weight?

126
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,880
I could almost put my wings around you.

127
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,530
Maybe a little.

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,060
Po, you must feel weak. Let me get you some soup.

129
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,360
That's OK dad. I'm not hungry.

130
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,400
Not hungry? Po you alright?

131
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,510
Yeah, I'm fine, I just.

132
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,000
Earlier today, I was fighting with the bandits. Nothing too dangerous.

133
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,020
They were just... you know.

134
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,970
And then, the strangest thing happened.

135
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,170
I had a crazy vision.

136
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,260
I think I saw my mom, and me as a baby.

137
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,830
Mom? A Baby?

138
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,530
Dad?

139
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,510
What he talk about?

140
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,770
How do I say this?

141
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,170
Where did I come from?

142
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,650
Well you see, son.

143
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,890
Baby geese come from a little egg.

144
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,250
Don't ask me where the egg comes from.

145
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,820
Dad, it is not what I meant.

146
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,000
I know it's not.

147
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,120
I think it is time to tell you something,

148
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,220
I should have told you a long time ago.

149
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,280
You might have been kind of,

150
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,280
adopted.

151
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,800
- I knew it.  - You knew? Who told you?

152
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,920
No one. I mean, come on dad.

153
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
But if you knew it, why didn't you ever say anything?

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,300
Why didn't you say anything?

155
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,280
How did I get here dad? Where did I come from?

156
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,020
Actually,

157
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,820
you came from this.

158
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,100
It was just another day at the restaurant.

159
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,690
Time to make the noodles.

160
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,200
I went out to the back,

161
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,500
where my vegetables had just been delivered.

162
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,120
There were cabbages, turnips, radishes...

163
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,470
Only there were no radishes.

164
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,430
Just a very hungry baby panda.

165
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,670
There was no note.

166
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,990
Of course you could have eaten it.

167
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
I waited for someone to come looking for you.

168
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,840
But no one did.

169
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,310
I brought you inside,

170
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,090
fed you,

171
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,170
gave you a bath,

172
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,390
and fed you again,

173
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,160
and again.

174
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,210
I tried to put some pants on you.

175
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,720
And then I made a decision that would change my life forever.

176
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,450
To make my soup without radishes,

177
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,730
and to raise you as my own son.

178
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,410
Sao Po. My little panda.

179
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,890
And from that moment on, both my soup and my life,

180
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,870
have been that much sweeter.

181
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,760
My little Po. That's the end of the story.

182
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,100
Look at me. No, do not look at me.

183
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,590
That's it?

184
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,780
That can't be it. There's gotta be more, dad.

185
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,980
Well, there was the time you ate all of my bamboo furniture.

186
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
It was important too.

187
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,930
One dumpling please, Dragon Warrior size.

188
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,350
Oh Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning,

189
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,150
but look how it turn out,

190
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,390
you got me, you got Kung Fu, and you got noodles.

191
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,920
I know, I just have so many questions.

192
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,120
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket.

193
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,620
Why didn't I like pants.

194
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,820
And who am I?

195
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,630
Good, Watch your thought.

196
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,270
Good.

197
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,110
Shen?

198
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

199
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,020
Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way.

200
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,720
Please leave my house.

201
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
Your house?

202
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,950
Yes, didn't you see the peacock on the front door?

203
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,710
There you are, Soothsayer.

204
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,650
It seems your fortune and skills are not as good as you thought.

205
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,760
We shall see, Shen.

206
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,600
You shall see, old goat, where were we?

207
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,670
- What do you want Shen?  - What is rightfully mine...

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,360
Gongmen city.

209
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,170
Gongmen is under stewardship of the master council.

210
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,370
And we will protect it.

211
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Even from you.

212
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,530
I'm so glad you feel that way.

213
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,840
Otherwise they drag that gift for nothing.

214
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,220
What's in the box, Shen?

215
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,500
Want to see it? It's a gift.

216
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,550
It is your parting gift.

217
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,370
It will part you.

218
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,090
Part of you here, part of you there,

219
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,760
and part of you where you were there...

220
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,480
staining the wall.

221
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,250
You insolent fool.

222
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,190
- Show off.  - That is a warning.

223
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,330
You are no match for our Kung Fu.

224
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,150
I agree, but this is.

225
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,200
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen city?

226
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,070
- Master thundering Rhino?  - Yes.

227
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,990
- Son of the legendary Flying Rhino?  - Yes.

228
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,690
And the slayer of ten thousands serpents in the valley of Wolf?

229
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,690
- He's dead.  - That, that is impossible.

230
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,550
Rhino's horn defense is impervious to any technique.

231
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,940
There were no techniques. Lord Shen has created a weapon.

232
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,550
One that breathes fire and spits metal.

233
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,940
Unless he is stopped. This could be the end of Kung Fu.

234
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,030
But I just got Kung Fu.

235
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,630
And now you must save it.

236
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,890
Go! Destroy this weapon,

237
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,630
and bring Lord Shen to justice.

238
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,540
OK here we go.

239
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,210
Wait a second, how can I do this?

240
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
I mean how Kung Fu stop something that stop Kung Fu.

241
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,620
Remember Dragon Warrior, anything is possible,

242
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
when you have inner peace.

243
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,620
Inner Peace.

244
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,270
Peace on.

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,800
Po. I get you travel bag.

246
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,290
I pack you food for week, cookies,

247
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,290
buns, vegetables, and even pack all your action figures. See!

248
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,430
Oh! Er... Hey, I don't know what those are.

249
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,530
Never seen them before in my life.

250
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Dad, you make a scratch on my Tigress.

251
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,390
I also pack your painting, the best time together,

252
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,990
just in case you get lonely.

253
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,970
That me and you making noodles,

254
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,370
and that me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,790
And that me giving you a piggy back ride.

256
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,550
That cute, on second thought, I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,990
Hey, they are waiting for me.

258
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,640
Of course, of course, you have a job to do. Far from home.

259
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,660
A strange city, filled with strange people and strange noodles.

260
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,210
Facing horrible danger, from which you might never return!

261
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,010
Don¡¯t go, Po.

262
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,700
I got to go, I'm Dragon Warrior,

263
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
It's kind of my job to save kungfu.

264
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,820
And if I don't. What am I?

265
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,920
You are my son.

266
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,560
Right?

267
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,520
Po, it's time.

268
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,960
Goodbye.

269
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,840
Don't worry, Mr. Ping, He will be back before you can say "noodles".

270
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,010
Noodles.

271
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,970
Come on guys, let's go.

272
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Momma

273
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,810
Mom? Dad? Is that you? Mom! Dad!

274
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,090
Oh hi, hey hey, son, you are back.

275
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,690
Honey, what are you doing here?

276
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,160
- But I thought...  - We replaced you, dear, with a lovely radish.

277
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,080
Radish?

278
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,200
He is quiet, polite, and frankly does better kungfu.

279
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,260
Wait.

280
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
Radish, radish, ra...

281
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,420
Inner peace.

282
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,720
Pea...

283
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,570
Inner peace.

284
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,260
Inner peace.

285
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,340
I'm, er, training.

286
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,310
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

287
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,450
I'm ready.

288
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,150
Ok. So serious.

289
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,470
I think I prefer the mast.

290
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,200
Apologize, I used to punch iron wood tree by the paws in training.

291
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,060
Now I feel nothing

292
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,040
That is severely cool.

293
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,980
Again.

294
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,720
So this punching iron wood tree,

295
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,520
how long did you have to do that?

296
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
- Twenty years.  - Oh twenty, twenty years.

297
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,930
Is there any faster way? You know until don't feel anything.

298
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,880
No. Besides...

299
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,860
I don't think hard style is your thing.

300
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,020
Po. Why do you really out here?

301
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,290
I just found out my dad isn't really my dad.

302
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,620
Your father? The Goose.

303
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,020
That must have been quite a shock.

304
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,020
Yeah.

305
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,310
And this bothers you?

306
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,380
Are you kidding me? We are warriors, right?

307
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,070
Nerves of steel, souls of Platinum. Like you.

308
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,290
So hardcore, you don't feel anything.

309
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,360
- I was...  - So what are you talking about?

310
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,800
Nothing.

311
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,050
Po is having daddy issue.

312
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,150
I'm so lucky, I don't have any problem with my dad.

313
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,480
Because my mother ate his head before I was born. I don't know.

314
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,180
Mantis, it is not about you, Po is the one freaking out.

315
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,050
I'm not freaking out.

316
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,950
Po.

317
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm freaking in.

318
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,800
- Po!  - what?

319
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,810
We are here, Gongmen city.

320
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,760
My father's throne.

321
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,980
He always let me play here beside him.

322
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,110
Promising someday this throne would be mine.

323
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
A little to the left.

324
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,220
But it is so heavy, Master.

325
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,360
Thirty years, I've waited for this moment.

326
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,000
Everything must be exactly how I've envisioned.

327
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,990
And I envisioned,  a little to the left.

328
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,420
Perfect.

329
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,840
With the weapon, by my .. left a bit more.

330
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,570
With the weapon, by my side, all china will be bowed for me

331
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,210
We move out in 3 days,

332
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,410
when the moon is full and the tide is high.

333
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,100
Now you old goat, why don't you tell me my...

334
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,500
Fortune?

335
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,350
The future, I was going to say the future.

336
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,420
Looking to your bowl,

337
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,220
And tell me what glorious waits

338
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,270
If you continue on your current path ...

339
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,580
You will find yourself...

340
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
At the bottom of the stairs.

341
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,690
I see...

342
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,310
I see...

343
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,270
I see pain

344
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,530
and anger

345
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,230
How dare you, that is the finest suit in the province.

346
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,420
followed by denial.

347
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,820
This is not fortune telling. You just say what is happening right...

348
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,210
Now?

349
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,960
The most important time is now.

350
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,060
But if you really want to see the future...

351
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,850
What do you see?

352
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,350
A peacock...

353
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Is defeated by a warrior of black and white.

354
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,170
Nothing has changed.

355
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,380
That's impossible. And you know it.

356
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,780
It is not impossible. And he knows it.

357
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,040
Who?

358
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,680
- Lord Shen. I saw a pandas.  - A panda?

359
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,890
A kungfu warrior, he fought like a demon.

360
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,800
Big and fury, soft and squashy.

361
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,920
Kind of plushy and cuddly.

362
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,530
There are no more pandas.

363
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,940
Even with the poor eye sight, he can see the truth.

364
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Why is that you cannot?

365
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,280
Find this panda and bring him to me.

366
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,780
Yes, sir.

367
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,210
One panda lives, that does not make you right.

368
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,130
You are right, being right makes me right.

369
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,700
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

370
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,770
Would you stop that!

371
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,980
That must be Shen's palace in the other side of the city.

372
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,750
Great, we march to the tower and proclaim...

373
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,240
we are the Dragon Warrior and Furious Five

374
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,940
and we are here to bring you justice.

375
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,280
What are you doing?

376
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,080
This place is crawling with wolves.

377
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,160
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face.

378
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,370
I do not like that guy ...

379
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,960
We need to get to that town without being spotted by those wolves.

380
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,910
Got it. Stealth Mode.

381
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,010
Ow...

382
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,710
Hello. Hehehehe, I ...

383
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,540
OK. anyway, Where was I?

384
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,110
- Where is Po?  - How can we lose a guy that big?

385
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,580
Guys, guys?

386
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,480
- Po...  - Sorry.

387
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,750
So that was stealth mode huh?

388
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,210
Be honest, not one of my stronger mode.

389
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,540
You got more gold. Come on.

390
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:48,620
This rice is raw.

391
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,270
You stole of my metal pots for Lord Shen.

392
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,630
- Either you cook my rice or I cook you.  - My pot is...

393
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,240
Po, do something.

394
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,070
How am I supposed to help the cook-rice without getting caught?

395
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,420
Wait. I have a better idea.

396
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,960
- One...  - Hey? Hey?

397
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,040
We are here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.

398
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,440
You will need help.

399
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,830
Thank you, brave sheep. But it was too dangerous and I can't let you...

400
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,250
- Oh, not me. It's not safe to speak here.  - Right.

401
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,490
I'm talking about Master Ox and Croc.

402
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,710
They are in Gongmen jail, at Black Dragon area.

403
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,770
What? They are still alive?

404
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,280
They must be in that jail to gathering intelligent hatching

405
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,880
a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon.

406
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,730
OK, let's go. Thank sheep.

407
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,170
Hey! Stop that costume!

408
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,110
Get them.

409
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,710
Uhh... Sorry!

410
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:55,470
Take... That!

411
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,020
Keep going! Faster!

412
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,110
Now.

413
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,780
Got you...

414
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,340
Huh?

415
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,740
Where did they go?

416
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,590
Spread out!

417
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,750
Search everywhere!

418
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,620
What about over there?

419
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,210
Is "there" a part of every where?

420
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:37,620
I... I guess.

421
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,740
Then search there!

422
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,060
They must be close.

423
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,960
I can feel a Kung Fu chill riding up my spine!

424
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,810
Sorry, Po. It's just me!

425
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,500
Look!

426
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
Gongmen Jail!

427
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,910
Oh... It's cute.

428
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,620
Cute? Huh?

429
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,070
Nice work, Po.

430
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,770
At the first sight of trouble, I'll give you a signal.

431
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,940
Gaga... Gygy!

432
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,800
- You mean like Crane does?  - Yeah!

433
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,910
Excuse me, when have I ever, made that noise?

434
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,980
Master Ox! Master...

435
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,730
The ferocious Master Croc!

436
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,300
Hey... Master storming Ox!

437
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,500
I can't believe, we're rescuing actual legends of Kung Fu.

438
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,400
We will free you from those bondages, just no problem, gotta be a key around here.

439
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,400
No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.

440
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,770
Oh, good... You found it! Come on you guys. Yeah!

441
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,590
We're coming for you, Shen!

442
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,920
Guys, are we going or not?

443
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,420
Do we need to do this later?

444
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,820
I mean, you do wanna take back you city. Right?

445
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,440
Of course, we do.

446
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,300
But if we stand up to Shen,

447
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,010
he will turn the weapon on the city!

448
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,510
Listen to yourself.

449
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,090
You're protecting Gongmen city, by not protecting Gongmen city?

450
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,610
If we all fight together...

451
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,110
Then the weapon would kill, everyone.

452
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,080
Oh, would it?

453
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,280
Then we use... A sneak attack!

454
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,320
- We'll get inside, and then...  - And then you'll be stopped!

455
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,460
By the unstoppable weapon.

456
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,180
when I'm stopping you from telling me something unstoppable.

457
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,670
Master Ox, I'm not let you stay in the cell!

458
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,330
I like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,810
You guys see that? It's called being awesome!

460
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,130
Come on! whatever happened being hero?

461
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,750
The only hero in this town, is a dead one.

462
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,680
Like I said, you are not getting me out of the cell!

463
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,600
Yes!

464
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,830
Alright. Let's go!

465
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,140
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,600
It's time to surrender, panda.

467
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,930
Kung Fu is dead!

468
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,180
I...

469
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,910
You... You... Kung Fu is a dea..aa.ad!

470
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,560
Fine!

471
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,200
You stay in your prison of fear!

472
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,360
With bars made of hopelessness.

473
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,490
And all you get is 3 square meals a day of... shame.

474
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,540
With despair for dessert.

475
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,860
We'll take on Shen.

476
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,600
And prove to all those who hunger for justice!

477
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,930
And honor, 'The Kung Fu still lives'.

478
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,470
Yeah!

479
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,640
Monkey!

480
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,370
Gaga!

481
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,780
You... You're mine!

482
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,530
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours.

483
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,570
My fist in your plush cuddly super soft face.

484
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,580
Uh-ouh!

485
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,190
Get him!

486
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,790
- Get me out of here!  - Yes, sir!

487
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,910
- Stop him!  - Yeah!

488
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Faster!

489
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,820
Po, go!

490
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,650
- Lose him!  -Yes, Sir!

491
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,370
Hang on!

492
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,220
Watch out!

493
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,600
Very uncool!

494
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,940
Try this!

495
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,940
Guys, guys, guys.

496
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,750
Maybe something small.

497
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, no!

498
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,330
You better get off my face!

499
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,330
Pardon me! Ok, pardon me.

500
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,780
Fire! Fire!

501
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,910
We lost them.

502
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,070
Yeah! Again!

503
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,580
Crane, catch!

504
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,430
Guys, guys, guys... give me a shot!

505
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,270
Mantis, now!

506
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,380
Is that all you got to defeat us?

507
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,690
This cloud is about to bring the thunder!

508
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,390
Your turn!

509
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,760
Why there are... so... many... signs?

510
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,420
Come here!

511
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,640
I like to squash you.

512
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,110
Yes! Taste of the defeat.

513
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,980
Let me tell you something...

514
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,400
Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole...

515
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,380
Guess nobody told you, if you mess with a wolf...

516
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,960
You'll get the fangs.

517
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,920
I hit you twice...

518
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,150
What are you gonna do now?

519
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,050
We surrender!

520
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,400
You could chain my body but you will never chain my... warrior spirit.

521
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,610
- Hey, don't forget the little guy!  - Did you just called me...

522
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,940
Po, what're you doing?

523
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,620
Trust me, I gotta a... pla... ww!

524
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
No way!

525
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,790
Eight-point acupuncture cuffs!

526
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,480
Just like the one that held Tai Lung, the more you move the tighter they get...

527
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,240
These are "the" best cuffs.

528
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,790
Greetings, panda. At last we meet.

529
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,000
No. No, no, no..

530
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,040
We meet at last!

531
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,190
Yes! That's it!

532
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,210
Greetings, panda. We meet at..

533
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,730
You are afraid for a reason.

534
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm not afraid.

535
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,210
He's coming to me in chains.

536
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,170
Have anyone should be afraid? It's...

537
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,790
You!

538
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,440
Don't you even think about it.

539
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,650
I hope this turns out better than your plan to...

540
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,260
cook rice in your stomach by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.

541
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,000
This plan's nothing like that plan.

542
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,800
How?

543
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
Cuz is one's gonna work!

544
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,660
Keep moving.

545
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,340
Ah... My old enemy!

546
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,720
Stairs!

547
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,840
Thanks for carrying me. This is last free flight.

548
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,520
Okay. I threw up a little bit on the third floor,

549
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,730
Someone might wanna clean that up.

550
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,110
There's some sort of evil janitor, or something?

551
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,510
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

552
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,820
Hey, how you doing?

553
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,700
Hey...

554
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,290
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

555
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,130
Hey, okay. Enough of... the poking around.

556
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,420
Strong.

557
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,930
Healthy.

558
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,010
Look, I don't know who you are. But please stand aside, sir.

559
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,810
That's a lady!

560
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,810
Oh... sorry!

561
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,690
The beard threw me, it's kind of misleading.

562
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,720
False avatar.

563
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,970
Enough of this nonsense!

564
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,220
Bring the prisoners to me.

565
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,200
Sorry ma'am. Get ready guys, keep your eyes peeled for the..

566
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,950
Weapon!

567
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,450
Sparrow kick!

568
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,900
We did it! I just Kung-Fued it. Did you guys see that?

569
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,480
I was all like...

570
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
Waao!

571
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,120
Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?

572
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,540
I do not!

573
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,400
I know he is.

574
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,770
Look at him!

575
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,340
A lifetime to plot his revenge, and he comes me on his knees.

576
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,100
What? A life time... Wo-wo-wo! I did not have a life time.

577
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,620
We only heard about master Rhino a few days ago,

578
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,410
And we've came to avenge him!

579
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,170
You've come to avenge, nothing else?

580
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,210
Well, Yeah. All the pots and pants that you stole,

581
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,810
I want those back.

582
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,330
Nothing else?

583
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,900
You probably did some evil stuffs along the way.

584
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,450
I don't know. What else did you do?

585
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,430
- You don't know?  - Know what?

586
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,300
What's so funny?

587
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,260
Many things.

588
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,370
Did you clearly do not know?

589
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,190
Okay, enough for these riddles!

590
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,060
Would you guys spill the beans?

591
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,750
First we know, we came in and the weapon is tiny.

592
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,750
Surprise, it's big.

593
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,950
And then, lady over here, I think is a guy, he's got...

594
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,620
The only reason you're still alive,

595
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,880
is that I find your stupidity, mildly amusing.

596
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,380
Well, thank you. But I found your evilness, extremely annoying!

597
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,600
Who do you think you are, panda?

598
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,810
Who do you think am I, peacock?

599
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,970
Why are we laughing?

600
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,830
Take him.

601
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,740
Fire!

602
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,140
Well, light that thing.

603
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,440
I did!

604
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,130
Here the bug!

605
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,230
Get the weapon!

606
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,760
Tigress!

607
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,230
- You... you were there.  - Yes. Yes, I was!

608
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,630
You just let Shen get away.

609
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,250
At least, we destroyed the weapon.

610
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,940
Fire!

611
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,180
Uh... No! He's got a way more.

612
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,040
Wow!

613
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,160
My wings!

614
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,070
- Help, Po!  - Coming!

615
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,900
Watch out!

616
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,400
Po!

617
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,800
- Help me up!  - No. Get him down.

618
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,940
Use the ropes.

619
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,650
Run, run. Little panda!

620
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,880
Come on! We need you to focus.

621
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,010
I've got it, I've got it!

622
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,140
Bring 'em down!

623
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,980
- We trapped!  - This way.

624
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,100
Good bye!

625
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,880
Fire!

626
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:40,780
Get back!

627
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,180
The only way out is up.

628
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,700
What?

629
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,130
Follow me.

630
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,620
Come on!

631
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,800
Where are they going?

632
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,070
To the top!

633
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,550
Come on, keep going!

634
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,420
Here we go!

635
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,670
You idiot!

636
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,580
My nose!

637
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,990
Call in the wolves.. All of them!

638
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,110
I want them ready to move!

639
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,370
The year of the peacock, begins now!

640
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,230
Right now?

641
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,410
'Cause it's the middle of the year.

642
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,080
So you only get, like a half of the year of peacock.

643
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,450
Get the wolves ready.

644
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,000
We're loading the ships, now.

645
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,210
Now!

646
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,900
Now, now, now...!

647
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:07,100
Move, move, move!

648
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,460
This way.

649
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:30,840
Go!

650
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,620
Oh... you!

651
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,040
What did you do?

652
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,290
It's chaos up there. What happened to stopping Shen?

653
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,710
Yeah.

654
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,750
Guys, come on! Give me a little credit.

655
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,460
I met for him, to get away,

656
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,430
'Cause.. it's a trick, it was a plot!

657
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:58,660
I was thinking, uh, figure out his plot... more.

658
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,060
That makes no sense.

659
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,040
What you mean? It sure does.

660
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,100
Po, the truth! You had Shen.

661
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,030
What happened?

662
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,670
What're you talking about? I don't know, what are you talking about?

663
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,980
Uh.. Yeah! Ahh.. He caught me off guard.

664
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,860
The truth!

665
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,320
Fine!

666
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,460
They'll keep you far from danger.

667
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,700
Real far.

668
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,010
What?

669
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,440
You're staying here.

670
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,530
Wa... wait!

671
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,430
I have to go back.

672
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,410
You are staying here.

673
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,900
I'm going ,and you can't stop me!

674
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,410
Okay, I wasn't ready that time.

675
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,970
Guys, don't!

676
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,230
Ready!

677
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,780
Look!

678
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,320
Stay down.

679
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,140
I have to get to him.

680
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,750
Then tell me why!

681
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,510
He was there, okay?

682
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,780
The Peacock was there, the last time I saw my parents.

683
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,850
He knows what happened.

684
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,380
Where I came from.

685
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,340
Who I am.

686
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,540
Look, I'm going.

687
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,080
I have to know.

688
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,020
The hardcore can't understand.

689
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,130
Tigress! No!

690
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,400
The hardcore do understand.

691
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,370
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

692
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,850
We're going!

693
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,200
Hey, maybe you can't watch me being killed.

694
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,640
Stop being a wimp.

695
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,470
And she's back.

696
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,100
Don't worry kid. You're better off here.

697
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,610
You're wrong, Soothsayer.

698
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,050
We sail to victory tonight.

699
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,880
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

700
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,250
Are you certain the panda who is the fool?

701
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,280
You just destroyed your ancestors' home, Shen.

702
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,000
A trivial sacrifice.

703
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,320
When all of China is my reward.

704
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,790
When will you be finally satisfied?

705
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,180
Will the subjugation of the whole world

706
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,520
finally make you feel better?

707
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,830
It's a start.

708
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,230
I might as well convert the basement into a dungeon.

709
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,520
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.

710
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,680
It is time to stop this madness.

711
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,440
Why on earth would I do that?

712
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:54,550
So that your parents can rest in peace.

713
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,100
My parents hated me.

714
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,080
Do you understand?

715
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,650
They wronged me.

716
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,190
And... I will make it right.

717
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,660
They loved you.

718
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,820
They loved you so much that having to send you away, killed them.

719
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,580
The dead exist in the past.

720
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,080
And I must turn to the future.

721
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,440
Set the soothsayer free.

722
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,940
She's no use to me.

723
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,580
Goodbye, Shen.

724
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,800
I wish you happiness.

725
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,790
Happiness, must be taken!

726
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,630
And I will take mine.

727
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,870
Hurry it up!

728
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,290
If all of those weapons leave the building,

729
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,420
China will fall.

730
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:11,830
We bring down the building.

731
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,110
Hey guys.

732
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,830
How about this?

733
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,320
Oh!

734
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,550
This will work.

735
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,940
Alright, let's go.

736
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,400
I can't feel my face.

737
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,730
Dumb hell crow... year of the Peacock.

738
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,030
Hey.

739
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,230
Hey.

740
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,000
Keep it cool, keep it cool.

741
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,990
You!

742
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,790
Where are you going?

743
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,700
On your feet!

744
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,450
And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.

745
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,490
Move, you dogs! Faster! Faster!

746
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:10,250
Load them all!

747
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,940
Greetings, Panda.

748
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,860
Tell me what happened that night?

749
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,320
What night?

750
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,570
That night!

751
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,540
Oh, that night.

752
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,550
Yes!

753
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:34,400
We are talking about the same night right?

754
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,200
Yes, I was there.

755
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,940
Yes, I watched your parents abandoned you. It was a terrible thing.

756
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,890
I believe it went something like this!

757
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,700
Here's your new year's gift!

758
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,590
Hope you like it. Cause you can't return it.

759
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,990
Po?

760
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,940
What is he doing here?

761
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:04,800
Return it! Return it!

762
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,300
Are you willing to die to find out the truth?

763
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,600
You bet I am!

764
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,800
Although I prefer not to.

765
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,230
We got them! Go!

766
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,540
Looking for me?

767
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,170
I said that too soon, didn't I?

768
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,670
Po!

769
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,490
Po, get away from him.

770
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,320
No more running, Shen!

771
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,820
So it seems.

772
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,120
Now, answers.

773
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,390
Oh, you want to know so badly.

774
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,180
You think knowing will heal you, uh?

775
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,250
Fill some craters in your soul.

776
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,950
Well, here's your answer.

777
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,140
Your parents didn't love you.

778
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,840
But here...

779
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,040
let me... heal you.

780
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,240
No..ooo!

781
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,340
Huh!... Ohhh!

782
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,070
Ya, like you can make me drink that.

783
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,670
Argh...arghh...

784
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,020
If I wanted you dead,

785
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,800
I would have left you in that river.

786
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,980
Why did you save me?

787
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,900
So you can fulfill your destiny.

788
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,340
What are you talking about?

789
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,220
Where am I?

790
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,730
What is this place?

791
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,670
I'm surprised you remember so little.

792
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,590
But you were so little when it happened.

793
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,190
Perhaps you do remember.

794
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,730
Remember what? It's just a stupid nightmare.

795
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,320
Nightmare? Or memory?

796
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,800
This was a thriving village.

797
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,830
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.

798
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,300
But he wanted more.

799
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:55,190
I foretold that someone would stand in his way.

800
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,750
A panda.

801
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,080
But I never could have foretold what came next.

802
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,710
Get them all.

803
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:25,450
Take our son and run away! Go!

804
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,600
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

805
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:50,260
Your story may not have such a happy beginning.

806
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,430
But that does not make you who you are.

807
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,020
It is the rest of your story.

808
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,870
Who you choose to be.

809
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:35,330
So, who are you, panda?

810
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,840
I am Po.

811
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,640
And I am gonna need a hat.

812
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,000
Such sad-sad faces.

813
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,800
But now is a time only for joy.

814
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,000
You are going to be a part of something beautiful.

815
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,280
Once you reach the harbour, in front of all the world.

816
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,780
You and your precious Kung Fu will die.

817
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,720
Then China will know to bow before me.

818
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,990
Set sail!

819
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,650
Honestly guys, I never thought I'll die like this.

820
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,930
I always thought I'll meet a nice girl and settle down

821
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,470
and she'll eat my head.

822
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,970
So sad.

823
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,390
We cannot give up hope.

824
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,390
Po would want us to remain strong.

825
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,300
Hardcored! Right, Tigress?

826
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,750
Lord Shen, what about the bridge?

827
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:28,810
Nothing stands in my way.

828
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,090
Fire!

829
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:41,050
You coward!

830
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,850
Po?

831
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:55,550
Po?

832
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,320
How many times do I have to kill

833
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,900
the same stinking panda?

834
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,600
Shen!

835
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,480
A panda stands between you and your destiny!

836
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,760
What?

837
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:23,480
Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.

838
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,910
And bring the terror to an end.

839
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:26,910
What?

840
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,860
And now... free the Five!

841
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,960
Fist of Destruction!

842
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,720
Okay.

843
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,320
Take aim!

844
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,020
Ready?

845
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,790
This way now...

846
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,920
... that way...

847
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,440
You can't follow me.

848
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,890
Just get him!

849
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,370
Come on.

850
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,450
No, no, don't shoot!

851
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:39,440
Don't shoot!

852
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,640
Don't shoot! Shoot!

853
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,880
Shoot! Don't shoot!

854
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,830
Don't shoot! Cross fire!

855
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,340
Attack!

856
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,240
Catch your freedom.

857
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,820
Monkey!

858
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,220
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.

859
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,100
What's your plan?

860
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,590
Step one, free the Five.

861
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,660
What's step two?

862
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,440
- Honestly, I didn't think I'll make it this far.  - Po!

863
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,860
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

864
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,790
Guys!

865
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,330
Viper, puppet of death!

866
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,130
Tigress!

867
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,620
Master Ox!

868
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,820
Jump!

869
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:39,020
And Croc!

870
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:40,440
Vengeance is served.

871
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,040
- Why did you... ?  - Your friend there is very persuasive.

872
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,580
Master Shifu!

873
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,790
Quickly! Use their boats to block the way.

874
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:08,810
Crane!

875
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:11,370
Wings of Justice!

876
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:12,870
Kaka!

877
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,620
What?

878
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,280
I... love... you... guys!

879
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,760
Why aren't we firing?

880
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,810
They're taking all gunmen, sir! And getting close!

881
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:55,030
Fire then! Go fire that gun!

882
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,100
But sir! That's our own... 

883
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:00,600
I said fire at them! Fire!

884
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,500
No!

885
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,860
Po!

886
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,770
Tigress?

887
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,990
As you wish,

888
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,900
let's finish this.

889
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,660
Fire!

890
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,210
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

891
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,320
Again!

892
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,850
Yeah!

893
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:55,910
Kill him! Somebody, kill him!

894
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:18,910
What?

895
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:20,110
No!

896
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,310
Keep firing! Keep firing!

897
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,640
Skadoosh.

898
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,510
How did you...

899
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,760
How did you do it?

900
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:33,370
You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.

901
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:36,360
Not that. How did you find peace?

902
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:40,310
I took away your parents. Everything.

903
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:43,000
I scarred you for life.

904
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,990
See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

905
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,200
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

906
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,760
Oh, yes. What do scars do? They fade I guess?

907
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,410
I don't care what scars do.

908
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,070
You should, Shen.

909
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,290
You got to let go of that stuff from the past cause it just doesn't matter.

910
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,680
The only thing that matters

911
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,960
is what you choose to be now.

912
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,520
You're right.

913
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,350
Then I choose...

914
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:11,550
... this!

915
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,140
That was pretty hardcore.

916
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,790
Po, come here!

917
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:19,740
Don't ever do that again please.

918
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,640
It seems you have found inner peace.

919
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,720
At such a young age.

920
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,770
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

921
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:50,640
What do you mean he's not here?

922
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,900
It's my son's birthday.

923
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,460
All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.

924
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,140
How about some tofu birthday cake instead, uh?

925
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,050
You know, I think we'll just try again another time.

926
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,030
When do you think he'll be back?

927
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,600
I don't know, okay? I don't know!

928
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,510
Maybe never. I'm worried, okay.

929
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,310
But that's my job. I'm his Dad.

930
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,630
I mean, I was his dad.

931
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:18,090
Why did... he go and save China?

932
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:20,990
I know why. But Why?

933
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,770
He's just one little panda.

934
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,050
So, how did it go?

935
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,850
Did you save China?

936
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:44,480
Yeap.

937
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:47,250
Well, I knew you would.

938
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:49,340
That's why I had new signs made.

939
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,730
My son saved China. You too can save.

940
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:52,750
Buy one dumpling get one free!

941
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,030
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

942
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,370
Would you like to try one?

943
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,780
Maybe later.

944
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,380
There's something I should tell you.

945
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,600
While I was gone,

946
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,880
I found a village where I was born.

947
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,840
I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.

948
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:17,850
You did?

949
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,130
I know who I am.

950
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,490
You do?

951
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,260
I am your son.

952
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,360
Po.

953
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,860
I love you, dad.

954
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,030
I love you too, son.

955
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,950
Delicious fat radishes.

956
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:43,950
You are probably hungry.

957
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,950
Let me make you something to eat.

958
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,930
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

959
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:48,530
- No, no, I'll cook.  - Dad.

960
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,970
This is something I can do. You saved China.

961
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,570
No, it's the least I can do. You raised me.

962
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:54,580
- Po.  - Dad.

963
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,280
- Po!  - Okay.

964
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,090
Let's both cook... together.

965
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,390
Together.

966
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,180
No, I'll cook.

967
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,660
My son is alive!
