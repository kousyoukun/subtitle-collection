1
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,744
Very nearly there, sir.

2
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:01,932
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?

3
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,377
Occasionally.

4
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:05,673
Of course, I've seen
you in the English newspapers.

5
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,195
- Are you a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.

6
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,847
Be patient, Snowy.
Not much longer.

7
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:37,134
Oh! I do beg your pardon.

8
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,545
There. I believe I’ve captured
something of your likeness.

9
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:56,426
Not bad.
What do you think, Snowy?

10
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,769
Oh, Snow...

11
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,767
There you are, sir.

12
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,265
Now, where’s he run off to?

13
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:10,299
- Anything?
- Nothing.

14
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,717
Snowy!

15
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,443
Where have you been?

16
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,519
Chasing cats again?

17
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,052
Snowy. Look at This.

18
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:48,614
Triple Masted, double
decks and 50 guns.

19
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,919
- Isn't she a beauty?
- That’s a very unique specimen, that is.

20
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,686
From an old sea captain’s estate.

21
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,452
- A Unicorn.
- Unicorn. Man-o-War sailing ship.

22
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:03,372
- It’s very old, that is. Sixteenth century!
- 17th, I would think.

23
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:05,447
- Reign of Charles the First!
- Charles the second.

24
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:09,097
that’s what I said, Charles the Second.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.

25
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:11,288
You won’t find another one of these, mate.

26
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,709
And it’s only two quid.

27
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:18,128
- I will give you a pound.
- Done.

28
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:23,739
Gently does it.

29
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:24,701
Excuse me!

30
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,775
There you go, careful!

31
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:30,367
Hey, buddy. How much for the boat?

32
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:31,849
I’m sorry, I just sold it to this
young gent.

33
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:35,383
Oh yeah? Tell me what you paid and
I’ll give you double.

34
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,535
- Double?
- Thanks, but it’s not for sale.

35
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,532
Look, kid, I’m trying to help you out

36
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:44,300
I don’t think you realize
this, but you’re about to walk

37
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:47,374
- into a whole mess of danger.
- What kind of danger?

38
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:51,717
I'm warning you. Get rid of the boat
and get out while you still can.

39
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,176
These people do not play nice.

40
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,674
- What people...
- Wonderful.

41
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,132
It's just wonderful.

42
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:04,206
Don’t bother wrapping it, I’ll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?

43
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,088
If you want to buy,
you will have to talk with the kid.

44
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:09,970
I see!... well...

45
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:15,005
- ... let the kid name his price.
- Name his price? Oh...

46
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:19,655
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac and
I miss 'name your price' by one bleedin' minute!"

47
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,499
I'm sorry, but I've Already explained
to the other gentleman...

48
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:25,381
American he was.
All hair oil and no socks.

49
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:26,995
It is not for sale.

50
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,838
Then let me appeal
to your better nature.

51
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:35,411
I've recently acquired a Marlinspike
Hall and this ship, as you know,

52
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:38,794
- Was once part of the estate...
- Of the late sea captain.

53
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:41,829
The family fell upon hard-times.
They lost everything.

54
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:45,173
They have been living in a
cloud of bad luck ever since

55
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:49,669
We are talking generations of
drinking and irrational behavior of...

56
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:52,743
I'm sorry, but as I told you before...

57
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:54,742
it is not for sale.

58
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,817
Good day to you Sir.

59
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,350
That young man,
What's his name?

60
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:07,539
Him! Everybody knows him.
That's Tintin.

61
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,724
What is it in this ship?

62
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:19,145
Why it has attracted
so much attention?

63
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,409
What secrets do you hold?

64
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,669
Where is the magnifying glass?

65
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,742
Could have sworn it was... No.

66
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,104
Reporter TinTin unmasks
Tribe of Gangsters

Reporter Uncover Crime Ring

68

TinTin Retrives National Artifact
Where could it possibly be?

69
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,463
Snowy, you have not seen the...

70
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,230
Where is it?

71
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,803
Thank you.

72
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,760
No, Snowy!

73
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,744
Look, what you did!

74
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:29,818
You broke it. Bad dog.

75
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,808
Something Happened on this ship.

76
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:44,498
We're going to one place
that could have the answer.

77
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,189
Common Snowy.

78
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:11,437
Here it is. Sir Francis
Haddock of Marlinspike Hall

79
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:13,705
The last captain of
the ill-fated unicorn.

80
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:16,280
Ship set sail from
Barbados in 1676...

81
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,469
...one of the most ruinest
voyages in maritime history.

82
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,967
The ship never reached its
destination. attacked by Pirates.

83
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,426
All hands lost except
for one survivor.

84
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,886
When Sir Francis was
rescued to return home -

85
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,614
He was convinced his
name had been cursed.

86
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,458
A Unicorns manifest stated they
we're carrying a cargo...

87
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:35,995
...of rum and tobacco
bound for Europe, but...

88
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:40,336
...it was long claimed "the ship was
carrying a secret cargo. "

89
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,104
What is The Ship Carrying, snowy?

90
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,985
"Historians have tried and failed...

91
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,291
...to discover what happened
to that fatal voyage. "

92
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:52,288
But, Sir Francis's last words:

93
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:56,747
"Only a true Haddock will discover
The Secret of the Unicorn. "

94
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,378
Missed something Snowy.

95
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,722
I need to have a closer
look at that model.

96
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:42,286
Of course, it's gone!
How can I be so stupid?

97
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:46,590
MARLINSPIKE HALL

98
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:04,998
How did you do that?

99
00:12:08,842 --> 00:12:10,801
Clever boy.

100
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:29,017
A coat of arms

101
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:31,746
why does that look familiar?

102
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,398
Hang on a minute

103
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:37,702
that fish! It’s a Haddock!

104
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:42,006
Of course! Hall is the old Haddock estate...

105
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,697
Snowy!

106
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,980
Well done Snowy. Good boy.

107
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,051
Well well well.

108
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,856
it seems we’ve
caught our thief.

109
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,347
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

110
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,850
I see you let yourself in.

111
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,445
I came to retrieve my property.

112
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:30,725
- I'm sorry I'm not sure I follow you
- Oh I think you do.

113
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,337
This ship was stolen from my
apartment less than an hour ago.

114
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,566
I'm afraid you are mistaken,
Mr. Tintin.

115
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:40,909
- There is no mistake.
It belongs to me. - Are you sure?

116
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,637
Of course I am sure. I took it home.

117
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,520
I put it on the cabinet
in the living room

118
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,056
and then Snowy chased the
cat and knocked it over...

119
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:51,592
It Fell.

120
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:57,127
- This isn't my ship.
- No. Indeed.

121
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:02,199
- Sorry. It looks identical.
- Looks can be deceiving

122
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:05,427
Yes indeed. But I don't understand.

123
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,462
Why did Sir Francis make two
ships exactly alike?

124
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:13,421
And you have one already.
Why did you want another?

125
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:16,725
What is it about this model that will
cause someone to steal it?

126
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:20,299
Goodness me! Why are
so many questions?

127
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,528
It is my job. There could be a story.

128
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:26,064
- That's what I do easy.
- It's no great mystery.

129
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,984
Sir Francis Haddock was a
drunkard and a hopeless reprobate

130
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,865
He was doomed to fail and he be
bequeathed that failure to his sons.

131
00:15:34,212 --> 00:15:37,670
So it is true.
Haddock clan is cursed.

132
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:43,089
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?

133
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:47,739
- That depends what you are looking for.
- I'm looking for answers -

134
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:51,812
- Mr. Sakharine.
- You're looking in the wrong place.

135
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:56,040
It is late.
I think you should go home.

136
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:58,307
This way, sir.

137
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:15,370
- It's a pity, sir.
- I'm sorry?

138
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,945
That the mast broke on
your model ship, sir.

139
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,404
I hope you found all the pieces.

140
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,863
- Things are so easily lost.
- Nestor, where are you?

141
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,245
Good night, sir.

142
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:33,740
"Some things are easily lost. "

143
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,583
What do they Mean?

144
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,197
What was he trying to tell me?

145
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,117
"Some things are easily lost. "

146
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,688
Snowy.

147
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,258
Great snakes!

148
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,521
What is it Snowy?

149
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,698
What is this?

150
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:28,233
This was in the mast.

151
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,496
Good boy, Snowy.

152
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,758
Three brothers joined to three
Unicorn in company.

153
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:49,293
Sailing in the noonday sun will speak.
For it's from the light.

154
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:54,788
That light will dawn and then
shines forth the eagle's cross.

155
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,822
What are these markings? Some kind
of secret language, or code?

156
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:04,165
...or code. Makes no sense!

157
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,741
But it does explain why
they ransack the flat.

158
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:09,699
They were looking for this
and they didn't find it.

159
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,852
which means...

160
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,579
...they will be back.

161
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:18,349
No, I don't know where he is,
Dearie.

162
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,384
I think he's gone out. And
anyway, it's after dark

163
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:26,220
and Mr. Tintin is most particular about not
admitting visitors after bedtime.

164
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,261
I have to come back to coco.

165
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:31,143
I have got a very good
book and a cup of coco.

166
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:34,487
- It is wonderful.
- Thank you, Mrs. Finch.

167
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,677
I can look after this.

168
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:42,672
Hey kid, is that you?
open the door.

169
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:46,246
- What do you want?
- Look, the game is up.

170
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:50,128
He's going to be back. Now I know you
want those boats, but I swear to God...

171
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,356
- I never thought he will kill anyone over it.
- Who?

172
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,891
- Who you are talking about? - I'm trying
to tell you, that your life is in danger.

173
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,044
Answer me! WHO?

174
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:21,025
Mrs.. Finch! A man has been
shot at our doorstep!

175
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:24,369
- Now indeed?
- Call an ambulance!

176
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:29,288
Well, Snowy!

177
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,507
Can you hear Me?
Can you?

178
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,843
The Victim's name was
Barnaby Dawes.

179
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,302
He was one of the top
agents at Interpol.

180
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,685
But we haven't got a clue,
what he was running off.

181
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,375
Quite right Thomson.
We're completely clueless.

182
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:05,143
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?

183
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,526
Tintin, we are still filling out the
paperwork.

184
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:10,601
Police work is not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.

185
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,638
Well I might have something for you.

186
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,058
Before his consciences tore, he was
trying to tell me something.

187
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:19,593
...and I think he was spelling out a word.
B, O, U...

188
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,782
D, J, A, N

189
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:27,317
- "Karaboudjan. "
- Karaboudjan!

190
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:30,583
- Does that mean anything to you? -
- Great Scotland Yard!

191
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,160
- Its extraordinary.
- What is?

192
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:34,427
Werthingtons have a half price sale
on bowler hats!!

193
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:37,271
Really Thompson?
It is hardly the time!

194
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:39,590
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?

195
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:42,036
canes are half price too.
- Do you take charge of this evidence?

196
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:42,998
possitively

197
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,918
Never fear, Tintin.
The evidence is safe with us.

198
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,799
- I'm going down!
- Please hurry?

199
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:53,450
Well! I am Already downstairs.
Do try keep up.

200
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:56,985
Wait! You dropped this.

201
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,753
Look after the evidence.

202
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,174
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.

203
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:05,401
Oh, yes. Like our light fingered larcenist.

204
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,245
- What? - The pickpocket.
He has no idea what is coming.

205
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:12,511
Come-on Tintin, take my wallet.

206
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,699
Yes. Industrial strength elastic.

207
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:21,004
- A very resourceful.
- On the contrary.

208
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:24,731
- It was childishly simple.
- Pretty Childish, I agree.

209
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,614
- Tintin.
- Gentlemen.

210
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,458
Mind you, I expect he's
miles away by now.

211
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:33,186
I presume, you are referring
to the Pickpocket.

212
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:36,799
We were just a few
steps behind him.

213
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:39,912
Snowy, what is the problem?
What did you see?

214
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:43,063
- I don't suppose you fancy a cup of tea.
- You are quite mistaken.

215
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:50,134
- I got you now!
- Stop!

216
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:52,478
I got you!

217
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,054
I got you!

218
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:01,701
What going on down there?
Come on, Snowy.

219
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,545
- Beg your pardon.
- I am sorry, sir.

220
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,619
Pickpocket
Tintin, he is getting away!

221
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,924
My wallet, it's gone.

222
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:17,151
Come on, Snowy! Up there!

223
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:18,803
Stop! Wait!

224
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:33,252
Gotcha! Steady on

225
00:22:33,676 --> 00:22:36,980
I've lost him.
You must find my wallet.

226
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:39,748
- It's very important, I have to
get it back. - And you will.

227
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,130
Leave it to the Professionals.

228
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:47,356
We lost the scroll
but we haven't lost the story.

229
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,161
Karaboudjan. It's an Armenian word.

230
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:54,543
That's our lead Snowy. What Barnaby
Dawes trying to tell us?

231
00:22:54,697 --> 00:22:56,925
- Mr. Tin... tin.
- Yes?

232
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,347
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn’t order anything?

233
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:02,729
Well, that’s because it’s you
that’s getting delivered.

234
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,235
karaboudjan

235
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:07,795
Quick! Get him in the van.

236
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,604
Get off me you confounded mutt!

237
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:15,642
He bit me! Quick!

238
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,197
Come on, come on!

239
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,651
Jerk him off from the bumper!

240
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,260
Eh, not here. Look your side.

241
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:46,989
- Hang on, nothing.
- Well, check that pocket.

242
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:51,293
- I've looked that one already, I'm sure
of it. - Have a look at his socks?

243
00:24:53,177 --> 00:24:55,098
- Have you found it?
- Doesn't have it.

244
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:58,018
- It’s not on him, boss. It’s not here.
- Not here? Then where is it?

245
00:24:58,134 --> 00:25:01,362
- Where is what?
- I'm tired of your games.

246
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:05,551
The scroll from the Unicorn.
A piece of paper, like this.

247
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:09,125
- You mean the poem.
- Yes.

248
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:12,699
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.

249
00:25:13,353 --> 00:25:15,351
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.

250
00:25:15,466 --> 00:25:17,810
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes.

251
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,885
I don't have it.

252
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:26,726
You don't value that scroll.
Why else would you take it?

253
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,607
I'm confused. Two scrolls,
but the part of a puzzle.

254
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,643
You have one, but you need
another. That's not it.

255
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:37,410
It is something else.

256
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:42,444
I'll find it.
With or without your help.

257
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:46,786
You need to think about
exactly how useful you are to me...

258
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,705
- We’ll deal with him on the way.
- Aye aye, sir.

259
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,588
Hold this course.

260
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:02,581
Snowy!

261
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,923
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.

262
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:14,110
Well, he’s lying! He must have the scroll.

263
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:17,492
- The question is what has he done with it?
- We searched him all over, boss.

264
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:20,105
I want you to go back down there
and make him talk.

265
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,140
- Break every bone
in his body if you have to.

266
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,987
Oh, that’s nasty!

267
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,215
You know the stakes, you know what
we’re playing for. Just do it!

268
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:30,059
Mister Sakharine! Mister Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!

269
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,557
- It’s a disaster! The Captain has come around
- What!

270
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:35,516
He’s conscious! He’s accusing you
of mutiny

271
00:26:35,631 --> 00:26:37,590
he says you turned the
crew against him.

272
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,512
- Sounds like he’s sobered up again.
- Well, don’t just stand there,

273
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:43,163
- get him another bottle.
- Si, senor. Aye, sir.

274
00:27:10,641 --> 00:27:13,638
- Jiggle it a bit - it’s just stuck.
- Jiggle?

275
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,750
What you doing? Geddofff!

276
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:21,516
It’s not stuck, you idiot he’s bolted
it from the inside!

277
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,976
So you want to play it like that
then, do you? Tintin?

278
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,782
Get the TNT.

279
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:30,548
Broken crates... rope...
champagne.

280
00:27:30,932 --> 00:27:32,853
What else do we have, Snowy?

281
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:35,735
There are other ways to open this door!

282
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,271
They’ll be swabbing the decks with your
innards when we’re done with you!

283
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,035
Give it here!

284
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:10,476
- Don't move.
- What!

285
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,470
Let's go.

286
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:23,619
He’s got a big shooter!
Got me!

287
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,960
Hold your fire.

288
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,760
He aint here - he's vanished.

289
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,257
He's hiding. Search the ship.

290
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:45,332
Quickly.

291
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,783
Ahh a giant rat through the scuttle

292
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:03,778
So you thought you'd sneak in behind me
and catch me with my trousers down uhh!!!

293
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,854
I'd rather you kept your trousers on,
If it's all the same to you

294
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,736
- I know your game. You're one of them
- Sorry?

295
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,618
- They sent you here to kill me.
- I don't know who you are!

296
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,694
That's how he has planed
to bump me off.

297
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:17,191
Murdered in my bed by a baby face assassin.

298
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:21,265
Assassin! You got it all wrong.
I was kidnapped.

299
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,994
By gang of thugs.

300
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,567
Oh the filthy swine

301
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:30,257
- He has turned all the crew
against Me! - Who?

302
00:29:30,911 --> 00:29:35,522
Sour faced man with the sugary name.
He's bought them all off. Every one.

303
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,751
Sakharine!

304
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:40,787
Nobody takes my ship.

305
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:44,399
- You are the captain? - If I'm not
the captain who else can I be?

306
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:48,089
I've been locked in
this room for days.

307
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:53,546
With only whiskey to
sustain my mortal soul.

308
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:01,732
- I assumed that was locked.
- Well, it is not.

309
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,767
Now you must excuse me. If they find
me here they will kill me.

310
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:08,956
I've to keep moving. Try and find my way
out of this drunken tub.

311
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,031
Tub?

312
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:17,295
Tub.

313
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,330
TUB!

314
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,941
Thanks. Hold him.

315
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:32,206
- I'm Tintin by the way.
- Haddock. Archibald Haddock.

316
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:37,741
- All welcome on deck. Follow me.
- Wait a second, did you say Haddock?

317
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:42,890
How could you let them escape?
Find them. Find them both.

318
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:44,889
- Don't worry, we will kill them, sir.
- No,

319
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,963
...you can kill the boy,
not Haddock.

320
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:52,459
He is just a hopeless old drunk, we
should've killed him long ago.

321
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:55,917
You think it is an accident
that I chose Haddock's ship

322
00:30:56,072 --> 00:31:00,107
...Haddock's crew, Haddock's
treacherous first mate...

323
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:03,257
Nothing is an accident.

324
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:11,866
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock, and I.

325
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,710
We have unfinished business.

326
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:19,052
And this time I'm going
to make him pay.

327
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,626
We have to reach a locked door at
the end of this corridor.

328
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,857
This is gonna be tricky!

329
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:27,238
You wouldn’t happen to be related
to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall, would you?

330
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:29,774
- Why do you ask?
- Why, it’s for a story I’ve been working on

331
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,311
an old shipwreck that happened off the coast of
Barbados

332
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:35,386
a Man o’War; triple-masted, fifty guns.

333
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:41,688
- What do you know about the Unicorn?
- Not a lot - that’s why I’m asking you!

334
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:44,839
The secret of that ship is known
only to my family.

335
00:31:44,993 --> 00:31:47,836
It has been passed out from
generation to generation.

336
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:53,140
My Grandfather himself with his
dying breath told me that they all...

337
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,830
- And...
- Gone.

338
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,174
What do you mean "gone"?

339
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,787
I was so upset at when he kicked the bucket.
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.

340
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:04,823
When I woke up in the morning
it was gone. I had forgotten all.

341
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:06,744
- Everything?
- Every last word.

342
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:09,664
Well, is there somebody else in
your family, maybe they would know?

343
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:12,970
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed

344
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:16,045
I am the last of the Haddocks.

345
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,735
Did you say three sons?

346
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,728
What was it?

347
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:34,683
No, there is nothing here.

348
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,563
- I know what Sakharine is looking for.
- What you reeling on about?

349
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:41,716
It was written on the scroll.

350
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:45,098
Three brothers joined three
Unicorns in company...

351
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,249
...sailing in the noonday
sun will speak.

352
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:51,631
- Really? - Sir Francis did not
make two models of the unicorn

353
00:32:51,785 --> 00:32:56,473
He made three.
Three ships for three sons.

354
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,164
Excellent.

355
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,391
Sakharine is after the
third model of the ship.

356
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:06,618
- Barnacles, someone has locked
the door. - Is there a key?

357
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:08,424
A key?

358
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:14,112
Yes, it is a problem.

359
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:24,066
Mr. Jaggerman. Top bunk in the
center. Keep out of the keys.

360
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,062
Careful mate, he is a restless sleeper.
On account of the tragic loss of his eyelids!

361
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:33,904
He lost his eyelids?
Aye that was a card game to remember

362
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:36,363
Oh you really had to be there!

363
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:41,666
Would do myself, but you are a lighter
and less chance of waking the boy

364
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:45,664
- I'm not sure this is a Good idea?
- You have nothing to worry about...

365
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:48,430
...provided they all stay asleep.

366
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:53,387
I would not get too close to Mr. Hobbsin.
He is very handy with a razor.

367
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:59,575
And steer clear of Mr. Kitzist.

368
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:06,070
Sacked from a ship on account
of his animal husbandry.

369
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:35,161
Not the sandwich. The Keys!

370
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:55,068
You are the brave one, Tintin.

371
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,989
My heart was in my mouth,
don't mind telling you.

372
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,831
Well, that is, if it was my heart. You know,

373
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:03,473
judging by my stomach,
it could’ve been anything, really.

374
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,058
Hurry up, Captain,
we have no time to lose.

375
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:10,747
Bingo! Just the necessities, of
course!

376
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,357
To the lifeboats.

377
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:20,922
Keep your eyes peeled!

378
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:22,649
I’ll go aft!

379
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:26,622
Any sign of him, Buster?

380
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:31,231
Not yet! Watch yourself, the boss
says he’s a handful.

381
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,720
Come on.

382
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,164
- It is Allan.
- Is he at the bridge?

383
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:07,931
Aye. On the other side
of the radio room.

384
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,003
Radio room?

385
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:12,939
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone Comes.

386
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,618
Be Careful, Tintin.

387
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,455
- This message has just come through boss.
- What is that?

388
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:31,681
"The Milanese Nightingale has Landed,
waiting in the wings for action"

389
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:36,139
- Milanese Nightingale..
- Now pray this cheers him up!

390
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:52,933
Bagghar.

391
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,890
What is this?
The Sultanate of Bagghar

392
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,809
Ruled over by Sheik Omar Ben
Salaad,

393
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:07,268
whose love of music and
culture is matched only by his love of...

394
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:10,457
GREAT SNAKES!

395
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,374
Bagghar.

396
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:23,023
The port of Bagghar.
In Morocco.

397
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,785
Tintin!

398
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:37,166
Hey! Put your hands up.

399
00:37:40,702 --> 00:37:43,161
And let that be a lesson to ya

400
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:45,390
Help!

401
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,920
Here! Here!

402
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,915
Here! by the lifeboats

403
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,797
After him.

404
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,129
- Over there!
- Boy you...

405
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,882
He's up there.

406
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,629
- Turn this ship!
- Aye Sir.

407
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,658
Get down!

408
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,694
- There he is.
- Get other one.

409
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:31,226
Go! Pull ahead!
Full speed!

410
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:40,065
- I Got You.
- Stay low.

411
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,169
Look down there.

412
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:09,003
- Idiots! You idiot what have you done?
- We killed them boss, as you'd say.

413
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,423
No! Not like I wanted.
I Needed Haddock alive.

414
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,689
Hold on, boss.
There are two boats missing.

415
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,917
yeah the other one must have been a decoy

416
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:30,562
They are on to us,
and our destination.

417
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:35,481
Find them. Make absolutely certain
they never reach Bagghar

418
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,235
- We have to get to Bagghar ahead of
Sakharine. - I know! I know!

419
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,655
- Why? - Because he has
the third Model of ship.

420
00:40:57,771 --> 00:41:00,038
How do you know?

421
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:05,918
The Sheikh collects old ships, and
this is the price of his collection.

422
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:10,491
Blistering barnacles!
That is a unicorn.

423
00:41:10,607 --> 00:41:13,604
- Captain, do you see the distortion
around the model? - I can see.

424
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,910
It means, in Bin Salaad exhibits
are going to be in a...

425
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:17,984
bullet proof glass
case in his palace.

426
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:21,597
- Sakharine is going there to steal it.
- He Has a Secret Weapon.

427
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:24,134
The Milanese Nightingale.. But that
won't be enough to solve the mystery,

428
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:27,477
and, that's why, Sakharine needs you.

429
00:41:27,593 --> 00:41:29,014
That is why he made you his prisoner.

430
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,973
There is something he needs
you to remember.

431
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:35,547
I don't follow you.

432
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:38,237
I read in a book,

433
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,965
that only a true Haddock can
discover the secret of the Unicorn.

434
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,882
I do not remember anything.

435
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:52,611
But you must know that your ancestors
Sir Francis - it's your family legacy.

436
00:41:52,726 --> 00:41:54,878
- My memory is not the way it used
to be. - What did it used to be?

437
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:56,991
I've forgotten.

438
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:01,564
Captain, can you get us to Bagghar?

439
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,331
What sort of a stupid question is
that?

440
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,635
Give me those oars, I’ll show
you some real seamanship, laddie.

441
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:15,169
I’ll not be doubted by some pipsqueak
tuft of ginger and his irritating dog!

442
00:42:15,323 --> 00:42:19,089
I am master and
commander of the seas!

443
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,853
I know these waters better than the
warts on my mother’s face!

444
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:29,888
Look at the pair of them.
Fast asleep.

445
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:34,038
Typical landlubbers, no
stamina these days!

446
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:37,535
Nevermind. I’ll get ya there, Tintin.

447
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:56,366
Look, Thomson! There’s the fellow.

448
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,826
Oh my!

449
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:10,277
- Mr. Silk.
- Yes?

450
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:12,545
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson

451
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:17,045
- We are police officers.
- Oh. Oh, crumbs!

452
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:21,191
Goodness gracious!

453
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:24,266
Mr. Silk. Are you Ok?
Poor fella...

454
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:30,338
Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right, sir.

455
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,642
- No Need to runaway sir.
- No.. no, you see.

456
00:43:34,758 --> 00:43:36,717
Yesterday, we very
nearly caught the pickpocket

457
00:43:36,833 --> 00:43:38,485
who’s been terrorizing the town.

458
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,097
We pulled his jacket and
inside we found the wallet.

459
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,673
- A wallet with your name and address.
- That's my wallet.

460
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,170
- Well, it's obvious he has stole
it from you. - Well, it's mine.

461
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,130
Are you all right, sir?
We didn't mean to startle you.

462
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:51,167
Let us help you into your apartment?

463
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,164
Thank you so much. No need to come
in. I’ll be quite alright really.

464
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,853
No, we insist! it's better to be safe than
sorry. Its least we can do

465
00:43:58,008 --> 00:44:00,582
- Oh, thank you.
- Here we are.

466
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:05,848
- Good grief what's all this?
- It is my collection.

467
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:08,652
- Quite a lot of wallets.
- I can't help it.

468
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:12,611
It started with coin purses.
and went on from there really

469
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:15,762
You ought to be careful. Haven't you
heard, there is a pickpocket around.

470
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:19,528
- Yes. Can you imagine.
- What do you mean pick pocket?

471
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:24,525
A Master Criminal. A bag snatching,
purse pilfering, wallet lifting thief.

472
00:44:24,678 --> 00:44:29,135
I'm not a bad person.
I am a kleptomaniac.

473
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,980
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.

474
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:34,862
No wonder, he keeps his
wallets in the living room.

475
00:44:34,978 --> 00:44:38,551
Wallets! I just cannot resist
the lovely little things.

476
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:41,011
It Is a harmless little habit, really.

477
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,999
Look at this. His name is Thomson too

478
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,296
What a coincidence.

479
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:47,967
No, Thompson, this is Thomson
without a ‘P?- as in psychic.

480
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:51,156
No, no, no, it’s Thompson with a
‘P?- as in psychologist.

481
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,068
- How dare you, sir?
- Look at this one.

482
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:54,388
How dare YOU, sir?
A green one that I managed to pick from a pickpocket

483
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,845
actually pickpocketing at the time.
And this one...

484
00:44:58,343 --> 00:45:00,495
I'm not your sidekick, you are mine.

485
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:02,110
Oh, smell it, won’t you? Piggy
leather. Oh, I love piggy leather.

486
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:04,338
- How dare you?
- How dare you?

487
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,605
- I met you first
- I met you first.

488
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,094
- No, you didn’t.
- Yes, I did.

489
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:12,216
Listen! I can’t stand it anymore!
Alright, I’ll come quietly!

490
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:16,905
Take them, take them
Take them all

491
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:20,133
Pull yourself together, man!
We can’t take your wallets,

492
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:23,668
- do we look like thieves??
- Good Heavens, Thompson!

493
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,088
This looks familiar. Tell me.

494
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,585
It is!
Tintin!

495
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,731
Oh, so cold!

496
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:42,998
...and thirsty.

497
00:45:45,612 --> 00:45:47,506
My throat is parched!

498
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:49,634
Let’s see if there’s
any fresh water...

499
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,869
Ohhh! What have we here?

500
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,825
Tintin! Tintin!

501
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:09,630
Come and warm
yourself, laddy.

502
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:12,820
Captain, what have you done?

503
00:46:12,974 --> 00:46:15,471
- No Need to thank me.
- What?

504
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:19,276
you looked a little cold. So
I lit a wee fire.

505
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:22,582
In a boat? No, those are our oars.
We Need them.

506
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:25,810
- Yes but not for much longer.
- Have you gone mad?

507
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:29,115
Quick, Captain. Help me.
Captain help me quick.

508
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,458
Ohh what have I done, what've I done

509
00:46:31,613 --> 00:46:33,688
No. Captain, not that.

510
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:38,222
Thundering typhoons

511
00:46:38,377 --> 00:46:41,681
This is a fine mess. We’re stranded here...
I’m weak... Selfish...

512
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:45,562
There is no hope of rescue. Sakharine
and his men are half way to Bagghar.

513
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:49,790
- oor, miserable wretch!
- All right, that's enough of that.

514
00:46:50,482 --> 00:46:53,863
That was his fault, you see.
It was Sir Francis's.

515
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,658
Tell me, how do you work that one out?

516
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,579
Because he was a figurehead of
great courage and bold exploits!

517
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:01,934
no one like that ever
existed in my family.

518
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:06,930
What do you think of drink, because
I know, I'll never be like him.

519
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:11,772
No it's far better I end it now
Put us both out of our misery

520
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,578
What is it, Snowy?

521
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:17,690
I'm going to lower
myself into the sea.

522
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:24,531
into the cold embrace into
the big blue.

523
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,720
Those are Portuguese markings.
Where is the Karaboudjan registered?

524
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:32,601
We are saved! We are saved!

525
00:47:32,755 --> 00:47:35,637
We are saved!

526
00:47:40,864 --> 00:47:43,131
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.

527
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:47,589
lave traders! Mutant malingerers!

528
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,817
Freshwater politicians!

529
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:53,891
Bad news, Captain - we’ve only got
one bullet!

530
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,119
- What’s the good news?
- We’ve got one bullet

531
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,108
You got that!

532
00:48:15,528 --> 00:48:17,526
Ah! Well done, my boy.

533
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:25,750
Stay here, Captain.

534
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,516
Tintin! Tintin!

535
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,014
Don’t take your eyes off of them! Hurry up.

536
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,664
Just as I thought, the ignition
lead has been cut!

537
00:48:37,817 --> 00:48:42,274
Ah! Lucky shot.
One more pass and we will finish them off.

538
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:45,349
Put your hands in the air.

539
00:48:45,503 --> 00:48:47,731
Now!

540
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:52,612
Let's see.

541
00:48:53,574 --> 00:48:56,187
You, you do know what your doing,
eh, Tintin?

542
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:58,607
More or less.

543
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:04,448
- Well, which is it? More or less?
- Relax.

544
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:07,024
I interviewed a pilot once?

545
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:17,784
Which way to North Africa?

546
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:32,656
Captain, look,
we've caught up with them.

547
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:39,266
Wonderful! But do you think we
might find another way to North Africa

548
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:42,879
that doesn’t take us through
that Wall of Death?

549
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:51,679
We Cannot turn back.
Not now. Not now.

550
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,505
No, Captain! Those a surgical
spirits for medicinal purposes only.

551
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:18,734
Quiet right, laddy, quiet right

552
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,801
Fuel tank! It’s almost empty.

553
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:21,067
Captain! This may sound crazy but
I’ve got a plan.

554
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:24,795
The alcohol in that bottle
may give us a few more miles.

555
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,792
I need you to climb out of
the plane and pour it into the fuel tank.

556
00:51:28,946 --> 00:51:31,405
Christopher Columbus!

557
00:51:37,017 --> 00:51:39,860
There’s a terrible storm out there!

558
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:45,471
- And it’s raining!
- And you call yourself a Haddock?

559
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:52,196
Captain?

560
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:55,424
Captain, can you hear me?
Captain?

561
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:03,687
You're doing fine.
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.

562
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:06,492
We’re running on fumes!

563
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,028
Fumes!

564
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:36,967
- Captain! I can’t see!
- Land! Land!

565
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:41,886
- We can’t! We’re not there yet!
- No, land the front!

566
00:52:47,997 --> 00:52:49,764
Do something!

567
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,344
Hold on, Tintin!

568
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm coming!

569
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:21,688
The Land of Thirst... the Land of
Thirst!

570
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:24,763
- The Land of Thirst!
- Will you stop saying that!

571
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:29,913
You don't understand, I've run out.

572
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:34,102
- You don’t know what that means.
- Captain, we have to keep going.

573
00:54:34,256 --> 00:54:36,331
One step at a time.
Come on, on your feet.

574
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:37,830
Lean your weight on me.

575
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:40,827
A man can only hang on for so long
without his vitals.

576
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,824
Captain, calm down there are
worse things than sobering up.

577
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:47,437
Look, Tintin! We’re saved!

578
00:54:48,129 --> 00:54:50,165
Water!
Water!

579
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,740
Captain, just a mirage.

580
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:56,852
It was here. I saw it.

581
00:54:57,006 --> 00:55:00,503
It was just your mind playing
tricks. It's the heat.

582
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:04,192
- I Have To go home.
- What?

583
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,766
- I have to go back to the sea.
- Captain, you're Hallucinating.

584
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:13,416
Look at that. Did you ever
see a more beautiful site?

585
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:18,796
She is turning into the wind.
All sails set.

586
00:55:19,257 --> 00:55:22,292
Triple-masted, double decks.

587
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,059
- Fifty guns.
- A unicorn?

588
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:29,441
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes it is.

589
00:55:29,595 --> 00:55:32,554
Tell me captain,
what else can you see?

590
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:38,164
She's got the wind behind her.
Look at the pace she is setting.

591
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:41,893
Barely a day out of Barbados.

592
00:55:42,162 --> 00:55:44,621
Hold full of rum, and finest
tobacco -

593
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,272
and the heart of sailors
set for home.

594
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:15,250
The Red Pennant.

595
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:18,593
The blood runs cold in every sea
captain who looks upon that flag

596
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:20,783
they know they're facing a fight to the death.

597
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:24,511
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.

598
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,008
and Haddock’s don’t flee.

599
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:34,230
All hands on deck! Gunners to their
stations!

600
00:56:34,234 --> 00:56:37,194
Let’s unload the King’s
shot into these

601
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,768
yellow-bellied,
lily livered, sea slugs!

602
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:43,034
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr. Nichols!
- Aye, aye, captain.

603
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:45,725
Prepare to bring her about!

604
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,194
- Mr. Nichols, secure the cargo.
- Right away sir.

605
00:57:23,348 --> 00:57:26,537
Prepare to repel boarders!

606
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:04,122
Destroy. We need more men.

607
00:58:57,502 --> 00:58:59,385
Then he saw him.

608
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:04,842
Like a phantom!!.
Rising from the dead.!!

609
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:08,569
Who, captain?

610
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:10,568
Who do you see?

611
00:59:11,452 --> 00:59:12,989
The ship is gone.

612
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:17,370
What do you mean gone?
What happened next?

613
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,943
Oh Jupiter I have beard!!!
Since when did I have a beard?

614
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:25,863
Something Happened on you.
It is the key to everything.

615
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:29,821
- You must try to remember.
- Unicorn... I'm so thirsty.

616
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:34,279
- Captain! - Tintin,
what's happening to me?

617
00:59:40,812 --> 00:59:44,501
And to think all it took was a day
in the Sahara.

618
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:48,421
Congratulations,
Captain. You’re sober.

619
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:51,419
Sober.

620
01:00:06,753 --> 01:00:08,712
Good dog.

621
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:14,631
- This one is all right.
Check the other! - Yes, sir!

622
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:22,816
Lieutenant Delcourt, welcome to the
Afghar Outpost.

623
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,967
Thank you, Lieutenant. We owe you
our lives.

624
01:00:26,121 --> 01:00:30,156
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he is not in good shape.

625
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:33,000
He is still suffering the effects
of acute dehydration.

626
01:00:33,154 --> 01:00:36,612
He is quite Delirious. Why don’t we pay
him a visit?

627
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:42,991
Oh, Haddock, you're awake.
Good. I have a visitor for you.

628
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:47,219
- Captain.
- I think you mistake the room.

629
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:52,292
Captain, it is Tintin. Our plane crashed
in the desert. Don't you remember?

630
01:00:52,446 --> 01:00:54,790
Plane? Oh no, I'm a naval man myself.

631
01:00:54,906 --> 01:00:58,326
I'll never fly, if I can help it. He is
confused with someone else.

632
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,901
What is this peculiar liquid?

633
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:04,973
- There's no bouquet - Its completely transparent.
- Why, it’s water.

634
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:07,318
What will they think of next?

635
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,046
Well, we suspect he has a concussion

636
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,658
- heatstroke, delirium.
- He is sober!

637
01:01:14,812 --> 01:01:18,119
- Now captain, out in the desert.
- Desert? - Yes.

638
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:19,802
you were talking about Sir Francis.

639
01:01:19,803 --> 01:01:21,831
Sir who? - Sir Francis.

640
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:23,804
- and you were telling me about what
happened on the unicorn...

641
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:26,034
- The Unicorn!
- Yes.

642
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,530
AAhh the stuff that dreams are made of
wee chidrens dreams

643
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:33,835
No, the ship. Please try
to remember captain.

644
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:35,833
Lives are at risk

645
01:01:39,907 --> 01:01:42,059
Snowy, what have you done?

646
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:48,131
I’d stand back if I were you.

647
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:54,510
He will just snap.
Out! Everybody out of the room!!!!

648
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:07,500
Show yourself Red Rackham!

649
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:16,223
If it’s a fight you want
you’ve met your match!

650
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:21,641
- A fight with who?
- To the death... Red Rackham.

651
01:02:43,778 --> 01:02:45,276
No, wait.

652
01:02:47,237 --> 01:02:49,389
Wait. Captain.

653
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:54,654
I remember everything now.
Everything Granddaddy told me.

654
01:02:55,153 --> 01:03:00,917
The Unicorn was taken. The pirates were
now the masters of the ship.

655
01:03:01,148 --> 01:03:05,567
- The crew surrendered?
- Granddaddy said that Red Rackham...

656
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:08,334
called Sir Francis the King’s dog

657
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:13,022
a pirate hunter sent to reclaim
their hard won plunder.

658
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:17,980
Why would I waste my time on rum,
tobacco, molasses, and dates

659
01:03:18,134 --> 01:03:21,016
when you have a more valuable cargo on
board?

660
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,089
- Where is it?
- You’ll have to kill me first.

661
01:03:25,244 --> 01:03:27,434
Not first, no.

662
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:30,777
I will start with your men.

663
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,309
To save his men, he would give up
the secret cargo.

664
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:40,039
And where was it?

665
01:03:57,525 --> 01:04:03,289
400 weight of gold, jewels, and
treasure.

666
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:16,201
- Kill His men!
- No, Rackham. No!

667
01:04:17,547 --> 01:04:22,927
You gave me your word.
Rackham! Rackham!

668
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:28,268
Sir Francis knew he was doomed, -

669
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:31,920
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm

670
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,609
But they didn't reckon on one thing.

671
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:38,068
Sir Francis was a Haddock.

672
01:04:38,223 --> 01:04:43,295
And a Haddock has always
has a trick up his sleeve.

673
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,742
And with that he hurls
himself forward!

674
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:02,894
On the pirates, like that, unarmed.

675
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:06,814
No. he was on a bottle of rum rolling
on the deck, and he opens it up.

676
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:10,234
- And he lifts it to His lips...
- Then than he stops.

677
01:05:10,388 --> 01:05:13,616
This is no time for drinking, he says,
I need all my wits about me.

678
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,421
with that he puts down the bottle and...

679
01:05:16,576 --> 01:05:21,187
Yes, yes, yes. He puts down the
bottle... And he grabs the sword!

680
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:26,183
He makes his way to
the ships magazine...

681
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:29,834
where they keep all the
gunpowder and the shot!

682
01:05:41,555 --> 01:05:45,244
You dog! you'd blow us sky high?

683
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:49,510
Well come on then let's have you.

684
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:54,890
Not this time.

685
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:53,572
You!

686
01:06:53,688 --> 01:06:55,840
Captain, what is it?

687
01:06:58,108 --> 01:07:00,106
How can I be so blind?

688
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,834
What are you talking about?

689
01:07:03,872 --> 01:07:07,023
This isn’t just about the scrolls or

690
01:07:07,177 --> 01:07:10,251
the treasure that went down with
the ship.

691
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:12,788
It’s me!

692
01:07:13,787 --> 01:07:16,246
It’s me he’s after!

693
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:21,473
You'll suffer a curse upon you and
your name, Haddock.

694
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:23,971
He wants vengeance

695
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:27,353
Come back and face me!

696
01:07:27,507 --> 01:07:30,888
- Hurry Tintin. We are out of time.
- Captain!

697
01:07:45,915 --> 01:07:50,180
I curse you. I curse your name...

698
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:54,868
...and all who come after!
We will meet again, Haddock!

699
01:07:55,023 --> 01:07:59,058
In another time,
in another life.

700
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,424
- It is not over, it was never...
- I don't understand. Who is after you?

701
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,845
- Sakharine.
- Sakharine? Why?

702
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:27,189
He is a Red Rackham's descendent.
He needs to finish the matter.

703
01:08:27,342 --> 01:08:29,246
That's why he did it
Did What?

704
01:08:29,248 --> 01:08:30,700
Sank his own ship!

705
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:33,030
Sir Francis sent that treasure
to the bottom of the sea.

706
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:35,374
He would be damned before he let
Red Rackham have it.

707
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:36,334
And he was.

708
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:37,866
- But he couldn't let it lie.
- No.

709
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:38,827
He left the clue.

710
01:08:38,829 --> 01:08:41,292
Three clues wrapped in a riddle
concealing the secret.

711
01:08:41,446 --> 01:08:44,827
- But only a true Haddock will
be able to solve it. - A secret?

712
01:08:44,982 --> 01:08:49,209
The location to one of the greatest
sunken treasures in all history.

713
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:51,860
The wreck of the Unicorn.

714
01:08:52,015 --> 01:08:56,127
He means to steal it. The third scroll!

715
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,162
Blue blistering barnacles!

716
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:04,158
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him.

717
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:07,501
- To Bagghar.
- To Bagghar.

718
01:09:26,986 --> 01:09:28,523
He is here.

719
01:09:51,504 --> 01:09:54,962
It's no good. It could be anywhere.

720
01:09:57,307 --> 01:10:01,495
Captain, don't look now,
but we are being followed.

721
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:05,415
Ah, so we are.

722
01:10:08,106 --> 01:10:11,026
What do you want?
Why are you following us?

723
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,562
Who are you looking for?

724
01:10:13,717 --> 01:10:16,138
Captain, stop! Stop!

725
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,319
- Thomson and Thompson.
- Not so loud...

726
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:19,281
We are in disguise.

727
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:22,055
Oh, I see. You got the message
I sent from the ship

728
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,669
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that

729
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:28,666
The upshot is we caught the thief, retrieved your wallet
and hopped on the next plane to Bagghar.

730
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,393
Yes, that pocket picker has picked
his last pocket.

731
01:10:32,548 --> 01:10:34,469
Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.

732
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:36,966
It's not the money
I'm not worried about.

733
01:10:41,848 --> 01:10:43,385
The odds are even!

734
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:46,535
Now, it's time to find
the next two scrolls.

735
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,953
The Milanese Nightingale.

736
01:10:59,718 --> 01:11:02,023
That's his secret weapon.

737
01:11:05,021 --> 01:11:07,326
Ahh! What a dish.

738
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:16,473
Enchanted, Signora. Bienvenuto!
Welcome!

739
01:11:16,627 --> 01:11:19,124
We are blessed with your
presence.

740
01:11:19,278 --> 01:11:23,466
Yes, indeed Signore Salad.

741
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:27,079
What charming peasants!

742
01:11:27,695 --> 01:11:29,847
May I introduce my escort,

743
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,535
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff!

744
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:36,226
He has been very...

745
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:40,260
...passionate in his
support of this concert.

746
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:43,566
It's my first visit to the third world.

747
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:48,370
Please forgive me. I must escort Madam
to the dressing room. Excuse me.

748
01:11:48,524 --> 01:11:51,483
Bravo.

749
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,287
After you.

750
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:05,157
NEV-R-BREAK
BULLET PROOF GLASS

751
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:15,771
Here, I want you to look after
this. What are you doing?

752
01:12:15,924 --> 01:12:18,037
- Me? - Yes
- Are you sure?

753
01:12:18,192 --> 01:12:21,535
If I’m caught, I don’t want them to
find this on me.

754
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:25,532
- Just keep it in.
- I will guard this with my life.

755
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:27,606
Get up!

756
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:03,078
It's her.

757
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,418
Blistering barnacles

758
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:58,763
What's that noise?

759
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:07,102
My ears.

760
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:10,523
- They are bleeding.
- No, they are not.

761
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:20,783
Captain!

762
01:14:23,435 --> 01:14:25,433
Shut up, Snowy.

763
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:33,887
Oh, Columbus! It’s every man for
himself!

764
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:37,517
Make way, make way! Medical
emergency!

765
01:14:58,138 --> 01:15:00,251
That was close

766
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:03,825
- Hello, Captain.
- You!

767
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:39,178
Oh, no.

768
01:15:42,255 --> 01:15:43,984
Sakharine.

769
01:16:09,425 --> 01:16:13,229
- The falcon! Snowy, after it!
- Tintin!

770
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,187
- Those two there, they're here to steal your ship!
- No. no. we are not!

771
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,761
- Arrest him and the ugly one!
- Who? Me?

772
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:24,720
Yes! Thief! Arrest him!

773
01:16:45,819 --> 01:16:47,202
Captain!

774
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:51,275
- Sakharine has got the scroll.
- It’s worse than that!

775
01:16:51,429 --> 01:16:53,465
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll Tintin

776
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,694
- Its gone.
- How? What happened?

777
01:16:56,848 --> 01:17:01,459
It was Allan. He knocked
me down in the garden and...

778
01:17:01,613 --> 01:17:03,572
- There was a bottle of alcohol...
- There always is.

779
01:17:03,727 --> 01:17:06,417
No, no. No, not like that

780
01:17:08,146 --> 01:17:10,144
I can smell it on you.

781
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,176
Hurry. Back to the boat.

782
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:22,788
- Tintin, where are you going?
- Going after Sakharine.

783
01:17:22,942 --> 01:17:25,901
- By yourself?
- Yes. Come on, Snowy.

784
01:17:29,868 --> 01:17:32,573
Get them, get them!

785
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:46,500
Lose them! Get him off our tail!

786
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:00,872
Did you hit anything?

787
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,138
Oh, dear.

788
01:18:10,249 --> 01:18:12,823
Fast. You idiot, faster.

789
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:22,815
I'll take those thank you.

790
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:26,773
Come on, Snowy! Come on! Incoming
falcon at 4 o’clock!

791
01:18:38,572 --> 01:18:41,223
Tintin, faster!

792
01:18:43,146 --> 01:18:45,912
- The scrolls!
- Got one! Two!

793
01:18:46,451 --> 01:18:48,295
and three!

794
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,600
Snowy!

795
01:18:59,478 --> 01:19:02,052
Oh no! Not again.

796
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:05,320
Come here my beauty.

797
01:19:06,626 --> 01:19:11,237
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
I'll kill you if I find you!

798
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:15,580
Captain, the bird! Grab it!

799
01:19:20,346 --> 01:19:23,112
Great work, Snowy! I Now don't let it go.

800
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:33,680
Blistering barnacles!

801
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,332
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I’m coming!

802
01:19:42,136 --> 01:19:43,673
There he is! There he is, stop!
Stop!!

803
01:19:44,249 --> 01:19:47,131
That’s right. That’s right, come to
daddy! Come to daddy...

804
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:50,206
Got you!

805
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:52,242
No!

806
01:19:55,778 --> 01:19:58,083
Geronimo!

807
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:03,003
You double-dealing, pilfering
parasites!

808
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:12,533
Excuse me! Pardon me! Sorry!

809
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:49,965
The scrolls are lining up. These
are hidden numbers.

810
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:55,960
- What does it say?
- I wouldn’t do that if I were you!

811
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:57,997
Let the bird go.

812
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,107
What do you value more.
Those scrolls or Haddock's life?

813
01:21:03,262 --> 01:21:04,338
Don't listen to him.

814
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:06,528
You’ll never get away with this,
you sour-faced sassonack!

815
01:21:06,682 --> 01:21:08,488
I will kill him.

816
01:21:09,602 --> 01:21:12,945
- Don't worry about me, Tintin.
- Let the bird go now...

817
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:16,712
- Or this man dies!
- No! Wait!

818
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:20,632
You two-timing troglodyte! You
simpering son of a po-face profiteer.

819
01:21:20,786 --> 01:21:24,667
Perhaps we should put it to test?
Here's mud in your eye

820
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:26,511
Tintin!

821
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:53,566
Oh! We are saved!

822
01:21:53,989 --> 01:21:56,755
- I love the beach.
- You said, you wanted a holiday.

823
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:09,668
- Nobody takes my ship! -
- They’ve already taken it.

824
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:12,127
Nobody takes my ship twice!

825
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,471
We’ll show them, eh, won’t we,
Tintin? Alright then - what’s the plan?

826
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:16,940
There is no plan.

827
01:22:16,942 --> 01:22:18,886
Of course there’s a plan
you always gotta have a plan.

828
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:23,580
Not this time. Sakharine has the scrolls,
They lead him to the treasure.

829
01:22:23,734 --> 01:22:27,461
it could be anywhere in the world.
We’ll never see him again.

830
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:29,383
It's over.

831
01:22:30,306 --> 01:22:32,534
I thought you were an optimist!

832
01:22:33,034 --> 01:22:35,954
You were wrong, weren't you?
I am a realist.

833
01:22:36,108 --> 01:22:40,642
- It is just another name for a quitter.
- You can call me what you like.

834
01:22:40,797 --> 01:22:44,025
But do you get it? We failed.

835
01:22:44,486 --> 01:22:46,176
Failed?

836
01:22:46,715 --> 01:22:49,943
There are plenty of others
willing to call you a failure

837
01:22:50,097 --> 01:22:54,170
a fool, a loser, a hopeless souse!

838
01:22:54,324 --> 01:22:57,897
But don’t you ever say it of
yourself!

839
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:02,817
You send out the wrong signal,
that is what people pick up.

840
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:08,005
Do you understand? You care about
something, you fight for it.

841
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,310
You hit a wall, you push through it.

842
01:23:12,271 --> 01:23:16,575
There’s something you need to know
about failure, Tintin..

843
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:22,570
It can never let you free

844
01:23:23,608 --> 01:23:27,297
- What did you just say?
- You hit a wall, you push through it?

845
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:31,294
No, no, no, you said something
about sending out a signal!

846
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,289
Of course! Captain,

847
01:23:36,674 --> 01:23:39,133
I sent a radio message
from the Karaboudjan.

848
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:41,016
I know what radio frequency
they are transmitting on.

849
01:23:41,132 --> 01:23:42,553
Well, how does that help us?

850
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:44,898
All we have to do is send that
information to Interpol,

851
01:23:45,014 --> 01:23:47,127
they can track the signals and figure
out which way they are headed.

852
01:23:47,281 --> 01:23:49,663
- Think of the devil and.
- Tintin!

853
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:52,353
Any port they enter,
we will know at once.

854
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,966
We can get there first.

855
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:09,993
What are we doing here boss, I don't get it
We're right back where we started

856
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:12,030
Speak of this to no one. Keep your
mouth shut.

857
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:14,028
Don't worry, as long
as we get our share.

858
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,795
- You will get your share.
- Where are you going?

859
01:24:16,911 --> 01:24:18,486
Guard the ship.

860
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,406
Good evening, sir. I trust you had
a successful trip abroad.

861
01:24:21,522 --> 01:24:23,981
Do I pay you to talk to me?

862
01:24:24,135 --> 01:24:26,363
You do not pay me at all.

863
01:24:28,516 --> 01:24:30,668
What the blazes? Nestor,

864
01:24:30,976 --> 01:24:32,705
Nestor!

865
01:24:34,973 --> 01:24:40,699
TOM, ALLAN, YOU BLITHERING IDIOTS,
DON’T JUST STAND THERE, DO SOMETHING!

866
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:48,691
Caught in like a rat in a trap.

867
01:24:48,846 --> 01:24:51,459
Congratulations, Gentlemen.
He is all yours.

868
01:24:51,574 --> 01:24:55,301
Yes. We also have an arrest warrant
issued by both Interpol and the FBI.

869
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:57,377
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby?

870
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:00,298
He was one of their agents. Right on
Sakharine's trail from the start.

871
01:25:00,452 --> 01:25:04,102
It still doesn't make sense. He has the
key to the treasure of the Unicorn.

872
01:25:04,256 --> 01:25:06,677
Which is sitting somewhere
in the ocean floor.

873
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:09,252
Why would he come back home?

874
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:15,400
Well, Sakharine.

875
01:25:15,555 --> 01:25:18,321
That is Mr. Sakharine to you.

876
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:20,435
Hold it.

877
01:25:25,816 --> 01:25:27,775
What’s going...?

878
01:25:34,078 --> 01:25:36,345
Allan! Get me down.

879
01:25:39,305 --> 01:25:41,649
Not that way!

880
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:47,643
Not that way, you fool!
The other way!

881
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:06,820
All right.

882
01:26:25,959 --> 01:26:27,419
Look out!

883
01:26:45,443 --> 01:26:48,325
we have to go

884
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,932
Close but no cigar!!!

885
01:27:35,978 --> 01:27:39,590
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.

886
01:27:39,744 --> 01:27:42,972
- Just as Sir Francis was yours.
- It's the unfinished business.

887
01:27:43,126 --> 01:27:45,816
Oh I'm glad you know
the truth, Haddock.

888
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:51,350
Until you could remember... killing you,
wouldn't have been this much fun.

889
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:20,749
- Who gave you permission to
board my ship? - I don't need it.

890
01:28:20,903 --> 01:28:22,709
I've never needed it.

891
01:29:22,276 --> 01:29:27,041
The legend says, only a Haddock can
discover The Secret of the Unicorn.

892
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:30,692
It took a Rackham
to get the job done.

893
01:29:30,846 --> 01:29:33,305
So you have lost again, Haddock.

894
01:29:33,574 --> 01:29:38,800
That's right! Why don't you have a
drink? It's all you got left! Isn't it?

895
01:29:38,954 --> 01:29:42,681
Everything which was rightfully
yours, is now mine.

896
01:29:42,913 --> 01:29:45,410
Including the ship.

897
01:29:50,061 --> 01:29:55,172
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.

898
01:30:13,311 --> 01:30:15,847
We have you now, you devil.

899
01:30:16,001 --> 01:30:18,998
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise,

900
01:30:19,383 --> 01:30:21,381
you are under arrest.

901
01:30:34,793 --> 01:30:36,330
Do you see?

902
01:30:38,521 --> 01:30:41,057
Blistering barnacles! They’re
coordinates!

903
01:30:41,173 --> 01:30:43,325
It took all three scrolls to form
the numbers.

904
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,666
Latitude and longitude... that is
it! That’s the location of the treasure!

905
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:54,200
We did it!

906
01:31:04,154 --> 01:31:07,228
Almost there, Mister Tintin.

907
01:31:07,382 --> 01:31:10,725
- A nudge to starboard should do it.
- AAre you sure we’re on course?

908
01:31:10,879 --> 01:31:16,067
Aye, trust me, laddie - I know
these parts like the back of my hand!

909
01:31:17,182 --> 01:31:21,601
- Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!
- Aye, Captain - starboard it is...

910
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,785
FULL STOP!

911
01:31:35,974 --> 01:31:38,856
Marlinspike Hall

912
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:41,661
Those coordinates lead here.

913
01:31:42,046 --> 01:31:44,889
This is where Sir Francis hid it?

914
01:31:45,428 --> 01:31:47,810
I thought the treasure went down
with the ship...

915
01:31:47,964 --> 01:31:52,268
Master Haddock, Mister Tintin, I’ve
been expecting you.

916
01:31:53,959 --> 01:31:58,109
- Welcome to the Marlinspike Hall.
- Would you look at this place!

917
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:01,106
I don’t think it’s changed at all
since I was a wee boy.

918
01:32:01,261 --> 01:32:02,606
And may I say, Sir,

919
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:06,371
how much I am looking forward to having a
Haddock back in charge of the estate.

920
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:08,024
You’ll be waiting a long time,
Nestor.

921
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,676
There’s no way I could afford to
live here.

922
01:32:10,830 --> 01:32:15,057
Well, Captain, you know the house.
Where do we start?

923
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:18,131
Is the cellar still here?

924
01:32:27,278 --> 01:32:29,276
No, no no, no this isn't there.

925
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:33,542
- I meant the other cellar.
- I'm sorry, there Is no other cellar.

926
01:32:33,696 --> 01:32:36,847
- It was bigger than this.
- Snowy!

927
01:32:37,577 --> 01:32:39,498
Snowy, where are you?

928
01:32:56,369 --> 01:32:58,021
Snowy.

929
01:33:00,712 --> 01:33:02,825
Just like you said, Captain.

930
01:33:03,172 --> 01:33:07,514
- You hit a wall...
- You pushed through it.

931
01:33:11,972 --> 01:33:14,354
My Grandfather must’ve walled it up
before he lost the house.

932
01:33:14,508 --> 01:33:18,581
And that shines on the
wall is Eagle's Cross.

933
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:27,421
You see the cross there,
but miss the eagle?

934
01:33:27,575 --> 01:33:31,956
St. John the Evangelist, who was
always depicted with an eagle,

935
01:33:32,109 --> 01:33:36,874
and he’s called the Eagle of Patmos.
He is the eagle.

936
01:33:38,335 --> 01:33:43,177
But what is he trying to tell us,
Captain? I’m at a loss.

937
01:33:43,946 --> 01:33:47,289
That island, the one in the middle,
that doesn’t exist.

938
01:33:47,558 --> 01:33:49,863
- How do you know?
- Because I’ve sailed those waters

939
01:33:50,018 --> 01:33:54,053
countless times. I’ve been there.
It’s a mistake.

940
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,856
What if it isn’t...?

941
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:04,122
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of it

942
01:34:04,275 --> 01:34:09,463
...a man like himself, who knows
the seas like the back of his hand.

943
01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:12,691
A man who could look at a globe

944
01:34:12,845 --> 01:34:18,033
and tell if one tiny island was out of
place.

945
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:36,249
Blistering, treasure, it is
Red Rackham's, barnacles!

946
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:43,665
What is this?

947
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:29,282
Just a wee tipple, a toast to our good fortune.

948
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:32,165
Oh, that’s better!

949
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,853
It’s odd really... you’d would of thought
after all the fuss and bother, there would’ve been more...

950
01:35:36,008 --> 01:35:38,505
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.

951
01:35:38,621 --> 01:35:42,387
I mean, by your own account he looted half of
South America! I just thought...

952
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:45,692
ach, never mind. There’s plenty to
go around.

953
01:35:46,768 --> 01:35:48,844
Ohh. it's a funny old life.

954
01:35:48,854 --> 01:35:51,918
Now you got
your story for your newspaper!

955
01:35:52,072 --> 01:35:56,030
- All is well that ends well
- It is not ended.

956
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,258
Sir Francis left another clue,
at the bottom of the globe.

957
01:35:59,412 --> 01:36:02,870
- Clue to what?
- Four hundred weight of gold...

958
01:36:03,024 --> 01:36:05,483
...just lying at the bottom
of the sea.

959
01:36:06,099 --> 01:36:09,480
How is your thrust for adventure,
Captain?

960
01:36:10,826 --> 01:36:14,207
Unquenchable, Tintin.
