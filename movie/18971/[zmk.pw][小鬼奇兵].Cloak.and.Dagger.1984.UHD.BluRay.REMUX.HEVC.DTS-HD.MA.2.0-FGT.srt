1
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,416
Jack flack escapes.

2
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,786
How could he escape?

3
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,081
Look at the dice.

4
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,796
So what?

5
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,008
- Twenty-four. Jack's
agility is 24, he escapes.

6
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
That's not fair, I got killed

7
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,929
and you should've been dead,

8
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,432
- well, I'm not, Jack
flack always escapes.

9
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,184
Dumb game.

10
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,770
- You just gotta develop
better moves, Kim, that's all.

11
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,062
You're getting there.

12
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,274
- I don't believe it,
how can he do it, Morris?

13
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,194
I had 10 times as many
bullets as Jack flack.

14
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,780
- Yeah, but flack had the
ingenuity and the contacts, Kim.

15
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,510
Hey, don't feel bad, I
haven't been able to beat him

16
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:26,534
all summer, yet.

17
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,078
- What happens next, Morris?

18
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,454
- Let's leave it for now.

19
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,332
I wanna think of something
really good to get you with.

20
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,292
Anyway, I wanna get back to my game.

21
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,046
- Don't look at me, I'm
sick of getting killed.

22
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,842
I'll give you extra gas
masks and a bulletproof vest.

23
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,720
- No way, you never get hurt, it's no fun.

24
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,306
And Jack flack always escapes, anyway.

25
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,613
- Flack to lady ace, come in, lady ace.

26
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,199
- Hey, you guys, be careful
with those, I just got 'em in.

27
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,494
- This is Jack flack
requesting an assignment, over.

28
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,706
- Hello, everybody.

29
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,709
Come on, Kim, be serious.

30
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,978
- You guys want a real assignment?

31
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,628
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,005
- You got your bus passes?

33
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,133
Okay, I want you to go over to textronics.

34
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,011
And pick me up some
catalogs for the new 4200.

35
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,721
- Come on, Morris.

36
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,348
Give us something exciting,
like cloak and dagger,

37
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
only for real.

38
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,517
- Okay.

39
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,238
I want you to infiltrate
their seventh level.

40
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,908
Then go to their vending machine.

41
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,660
Pick me up a pack of twinkies.

42
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,536
- Aw.

43
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,163
- There's a secret message inside.

44
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,877
Whatever you do, don't let
anybody see you. Anybody.

45
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,629
- You coming?

46
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,423
- Not if you're gonna be embarrassing.

47
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,507
- I won't.

48
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,304
Let's see, grenade.

49
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,899
- Now what are you doing?

50
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,443
- Jack flack says to always
keep your gun loaded.

51
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,156
Morris, could we try these out?

52
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,033
- Yeah, just don't break 'em.

53
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,580
- Time to go, Jack.

54
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,086
See you, Morris.

55
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,862
Oh, great.

56
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,702
- Flack to lady ace. Come in, lady ace.

57
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,994
- Yeah, what?

58
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,706
- Come on, Kim, play right.

59
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,252
- All right, lady ace to
Jack flack, do you read me?

60
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,502
- Loud and clear.

61
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,841
Prepare to penetrate the enemy
stronghold, follow me in.

62
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,884
- This is what I meant by embarrassing.

63
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,708
- Hey!

64
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,102
- You proceed to floor
7 for operation catalog.

65
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,063
I'll get the secret from the machine.

66
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,859
I think that sentry spotted us.

67
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,486
- Davey, put that thing away.

68
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,738
- Hi, kids. You lost?

69
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,492
If you tell me who you're
looking for, maybe I can help.

70
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,452
- We're looking for textronics.

71
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,371
- Ah, you're looking
for the game division?

72
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,873
- Thank you, officer.

73
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,535
- Take separate routes just in case

74
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,516
I'll take the fire stairs,
you take the elevator.

75
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,768
- Good, 'cause I'm not walkin' up.

76
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,415
- Sorry.

77
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,301
- That guy had a gun,
Kim, it was a real gun.

78
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,262
- Oh, Davey, will you stop it?

79
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,055
- Honest, I saw a gun!

80
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,640
- You're really being a jerk.

81
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,772
- Well, here, take this
grenade just in case.

82
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,815
- Thanks, anyway.

83
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,347
- Flack to lady ace. Come in, lady ace.

84
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,974
- Yeah, Davey, what is it?

85
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,476
I'm almost in
position, give me your location.

86
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,104
- I'm already up here
and I'm waiting for you.

87
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,232
- Textronics.
- Okay, start creating

88
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:31,983
- a diversion.
- Mr. Rice is in a meeting.

89
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,153
- Can I take a message?
- I'll sneak out the fire

90
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,865
- Davey, this is embarrassing.

91
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,119
- Maintain radio silence
from now on, over and out.

92
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,749
Murdock, don't let
him leave the building.

93
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,587
Rice moving. The
elevator, second floor.

94
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,010
- Will there be anything else today?

95
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,387
- Ah, do you have a food machine here?

96
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,473
Lady ace, lady ace, come in.

97
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,999
- Mr. Rice is in a meeting.
- I thought we were

98
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,903
- maintaining radio silence.
- As soon as I can.

99
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,151
- Did you hear them?

100
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,779
- No, I'm busy, now stop bugging me.

101
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,158
- The vending machines
are right over there.

102
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,917
- So, your friend cut off
radio contact, did she?

103
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,168
- 0h, hi, Jack.

104
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,547
- Well, some people just
don't know how to act

105
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,300
on a secret mission, I
guess we're better off

106
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,803
just handling this one on our own.

107
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,305
Like the maracaibo
assignment, remember that?

108
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,516
Back when I was known as agent x.

109
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,934
That was a close one.

110
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,310
- Yeah.

111
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,396
Yeah, there we were, surrounded by hordes

112
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,189
of angry mercenaries.

113
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,275
All you had was a ball
of string and a sealed

114
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,693
iou from the embassy.

115
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,506
- Yeah, that's 'cause I
told you not to trust 'em.

116
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,323
That's what I mean about working alone.

117
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,535
I guess you're right.

118
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,785
- Yeah.

119
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,515
- Help me.

120
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,907
Whatever happens, don't let them get it.

121
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,242
Tell the FBI.. One million...

122
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,075
Three-hundred twenty-nine.

123
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,939
- Davey, what are you doing?

124
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,987
- They just killed a man,
now they're after me!

125
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,067
- I got Morris' twinkie.

126
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,069
- Help, police, murder!

127
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,697
- What's the problem, kid?

128
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,708
- There's two men,
they're trying to kill me.

129
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,428
- They're up there,
they just killed a man!

130
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,579
- Charlie, call the police!

131
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,311
- He was right here, I saw him fall!

132
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,045
I had to run right by him!

133
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,455
You want to tell
me what is this all about?

134
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,843
- Well, these Nazis, or
some kind of bad guys,

135
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,928
they shot this FBI man.

136
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:29,720
Nazis?

137
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,532
- How should I know?
- Maybe they were Russians,

138
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,099
but they shot him.

139
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,726
And he was bleeding and he fell.

140
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,689
Look, I'm not kidding you!

141
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:40,856
I can prove it.

142
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,793
He gave me this secret cartridge.

143
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,943
- No, no, no, no.

144
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,361
Don't trust him, Davey.

145
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,989
That's the first rule of espionage.

146
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,740
Always stay true to your source.

147
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,621
- Secret what?
- What happened?

148
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,332
Well?

149
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,005
- Hi, Mr. Rice.
- Hi, Freddy.

150
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,335
Did you see
anybody on the terrace level?

151
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,134
- No, not a soul.

152
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,886
- We better hold him for the police.

153
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,391
- We better go talk to
the police, come on.

154
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,772
Okay, folks,
step back, clear the area,

155
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,023
thank you.

156
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,936
I better be going now.

157
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,538
You gonna be all right?

158
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,813
Yeah, I've got a key.

159
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,315
Okay.

160
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,498
- Davey, I've been calling
all over the place for you.

161
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,043
- Mr. Osborne, lieutenant
Fleming, San Antonio pd.

162
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,146
- Dad, I didn't do...
- Just wait a minute, okay?

163
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,797
Let him talk, come on in.

164
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,358
- Not at this time, I've
gotta keep an ear out

165
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,424
for the squawk box.

166
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,820
- Oh, well, go on to your room, Davey.

167
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,488
- But dad, I wanna hear what he has to...

168
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,430
- Just go to your room, Davey, all right?

169
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,315
- Well, your son created
quite a stir at the tower life

170
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,277
building this morning
when he reported a murder.

171
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,070
- A murder?
- That's right, sir.

172
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,155
We checked out his story
and found absolutely

173
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,826
then we tried to bring him
home, but he refused to divulge

174
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,162
the whereabouts of what
he called “headquarters."

175
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,583
Sorry, officer,
but he does do that

176
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,814
- we got 'em right where we want 'em.

177
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,832
- Let 'em think you're nuts.

178
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,067
See, if we're gonna be heroes,
we gotta keep a low profile.

179
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,968
No cops, no dads, we're on our own, pal.

180
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,597
There gonna be
any charges, or what?

181
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,349
- Not this time, sir, but we do think that

182
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,685
you ought to consider
getting him some help.

183
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,603
I have.

184
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,105
- For almost an hour, all he
would give us is his name,

185
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,356
rank, and serial number.

186
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,767
The tougher we got... - Good.

187
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,858
- The tougher he got.

188
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,485
If it hadn't been for the little girl,

189
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,821
we would've never gotten him home.

190
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,364
Officer, I...

191
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,593
- They'll sing a different
tune once you're a hero.

192
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,620
- Stuff like this with parents a lot.

193
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,870
He is a good boy.

194
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:42,996
He's just...

195
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,262
Going through a real tough time right now.

196
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,711
- He lost his mother recently.
- Oh.

197
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,303
- I guess we're both
having a little difficulty

198
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,633
making an adjustment.

199
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,509
- Well, I can say one thing for him.

200
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,221
If we were at war, I'd
want him on my side.

201
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,303
You ready to talk?

202
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,818
- They weren't murderers, they were spies.

203
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,945
They'd gone there to kill an FBI agent.

204
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,448
I just intercepted one
of their communications.

205
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,700
- Anybody else see 'em?

206
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,579
- If morn were here, she'd believe me.

207
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,333
- She probably would.

208
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,922
But she's not here and
she's not gonna be here.

209
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
You gotta get used to that.

210
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,677
- I miss her.

211
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,927
- I know.

212
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,859
I'll bet she can see us
right now, you know that?

213
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,490
Listen, I got an idea.

214
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,369
Why don't you and me call
up Dr. Sullivan tomorrow?

215
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,956
You just tell him what you saw today.

216
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,750
Just to see what he says about it.

217
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,380
- Jack flack was right,
you do think I'm crazy.

218
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,018
- Davey, you've got to understand
Jack flack is make believe

219
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,521
just like all these ridiculous games.

220
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,397
They don't make it any easier for you

221
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,232
to get a grasp on things.

222
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,488
See proof?

223
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,532
Show you it, this is
what the FBI man gave me.

224
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,791
Hey, come here, there's
something coming on.

225
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,275
- More cloak and dagger?
- What did I just get through

226
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,635
- telling you?
- Dad, this is important.

227
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,245
Just wait a minute and you'll see.

228
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
Oh, Davey.

229
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,058
- Just give me a chance, a
man was just killed for this.

230
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,870
Would you let me play it once?

231
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,562
- All right, play it. Play it one time.

232
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,195
- See, that's Dr. Boom
and that's Jack flack.

233
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,948
Going to the secret
underground bomb factory.

234
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,383
- You've seen this,
you've done this before?

235
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,451
- Yeah, I played it at Morris'.

236
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,706
Now, here we are, get the guards.

237
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,796
Okay, get the case.

238
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,590
Gotta light the fuse.

239
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,806
- Where's the proof you're talking about?

240
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,183
- I don't know, maybe
it's on the next level.

241
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,074
- All right, let's shut it off, all right?

242
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,724
- Come on.
- But I get another life.

243
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,053
- No, let's just shut
it off, that's enough.

244
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:50,828
- Dad!
- Why don't you

245
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,078
get ready for bed?

246
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,832
- Can I just play one more?

247
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,750
- Davey, I said no and I mean no.

248
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,210
Now get ready for bed.

249
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,131
I hate you.

250
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,723
- I know you don't mean that, son.

251
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,975
- You don't care about me.

252
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,023
- Davey, when I was a kid,
I was exactly like you are.

253
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,362
That's why I joined the air
force, so I could be somebody.

254
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,114
Let me tell you somethin', Davey.

255
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:31,535
Heroes don't just shoot bad guys,

256
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,662
they put supper on the table,

257
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:37,291
they fix bicycles, they do boring things.

258
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,376
Real things, not make believe.

259
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,045
I hope you'll understand that when you

260
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,379
get a little bit older.

261
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,761
I'm gonna put these games away.

262
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,661
I don't want you playing 'em anymore.

263
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,811
- Dad, if you'd just play
one with me sometime.

264
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,441
- Good night, Davey.

265
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,951
- Not too smart for a military man, huh?

266
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,201
- Shut up.

267
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,714
Will you get that for me, Davey?

268
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,805
Is this David g. Osborne?

269
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,181
- Yes.

270
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:36,976
Good.

271
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,603
- Dad!
- Yeah?

272
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,314
It's them, it's the spies!

273
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,486
Hurry!

274
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,491
They hung up.

275
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,203
What'd he say?

276
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,997
- He just asked who I was.

277
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,207
Dad, they know where I am.

278
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,686
- Oh, it's probably just a
wrong number, come on, let's...

279
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,378
- No, it wasn't, I know it was them.

280
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,630
- Come on, come on, take it easy.

281
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,716
Just go on to bed, it's
way past your bedtime.

282
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,389
- Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

283
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,102
- Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

284
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,108
- Well, I don't think those

285
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,986
guys'll come in when you're here.

286
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,529
- You don't, hey?

287
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,658
Okay, come on.

288
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:41,874
Everything's gonna be okay, son.

289
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,402
Dad!

290
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,698
- What is it, son?

291
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,413
- Well, I gotta go to work,
son, I don't have any choice.

292
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,932
- Well, they're just
waiting for you to leave

293
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,956
so they can get me.

294
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,546
- Yeah.

295
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,424
Listen, I talked to Dr.
Sullivan this morning and I made

296
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,344
an appointment for us to
see him tomorrow, okay?

297
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,846
- Humor him, Davey, this
Turkey's not gonna help us.

298
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,473
We're on our own.

299
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,226
- And I gotta work a double shift today

300
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,476
on account of that big
inspection I told you about,

301
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,356
but tomorrow I'm off, so I
can go to the doctor with you

302
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,358
and you can tell him
everything you told me

303
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,608
about those spies.

304
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,238
- Can't I go with you?

305
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,824
- Davey, come on, you're a big boy now.

306
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,794
I mean, you're old
enough to stay home alone

307
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,369
without making a fuss, aren't ya?

308
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,080
I'll tell ya what, maybe next week

309
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,082
we can get you in that baseball camp.

310
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,752
You'd like that, wouldn't ya?

311
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,384
If you need me, just call
me at the base, okay?

312
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,785
- Lady ace, lady ace, come
in. Kim, are you there?

313
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,412
Kim, come in.

314
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,539
- Yeah, what?

315
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,293
Listen, we got
an assignment for today.

316
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,795
- I don't want any more of
your stupid assignments.

317
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,523
Come on, Kim,
I'm really in trouble.

318
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,301
- Good, you got me in
trouble yesterday, now what?

319
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,011
- Remember the spies?

320
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,679
You mean the killers?

321
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,782
- Yeah, they're coming to
kill me, they want the cloak

322
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,184
and dagger thing back,
I need you to come over.

323
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,634
- What cloak and dagger thing?

324
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,313
Can't tell you
now, it's top secret.

325
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,623
- Tell him you're having your breakfast

326
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,887
and you'll call him back later.

327
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,442
- My mom says I gotta go now.

328
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,319
- Wait.
- I'm having my breakfast.

329
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:16,695
I'll call you back later.

330
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,408
- Is he always like that?

331
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,910
- Usually.

332
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,037
- Doesn't it drive you crazy?

333
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,039
- Nah, he's the only
boy in the neighborhood

334
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,289
who isn't boring.

335
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,293
- Did I teach you that?

336
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,588
Well, what's his father like?

337
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,216
- Forget it, he's not your type.

338
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,595
How on earth would you know
who is or isn't my type?

339
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,347
- He's in the army or somethin'.

340
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,723
- Oh.

341
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,604
- Guess you're right, we are on our own.

342
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,619
I'll get it.

343
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,318
- There's gotta be something in this tape.

344
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,641
- Probably encoded.

345
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,061
- Have it decoded, take it to
the FBI, and we'll be heroes.

346
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,451
- A good spy always knows when to bring in

347
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,690
outside expertise.

348
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,652
- Morris can do it, he can do anything.

349
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,531
Just enough to get the job done.

350
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,409
- But we can trust Morris, he's my friend.

351
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,329
Friendship is a
luxury a spy can't afford.

352
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,080
- What do you mean?

353
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,168
Well, okay, if you really think so.

354
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,340
Thank you.

355
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,716
- Morris.

356
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,343
Where's my twinkies?

357
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,306
- What, you made it to the
17th level of cloak and dagger?

358
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,433
- No, Morris, this is for real.

359
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,188
I got this real important
tape I want you to see.

360
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:56,980
- Oh, yeah?

361
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,691
- Yeah, it has some secret
code or something in it.

362
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,021
Will you take a look at it?

363
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,113
Morris, are you listening to me?

364
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,364
- Yeah, sure.

365
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,576
Hey, Davey, I wanna have the
twinkies or my money back.

366
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,247
- You tell me.

367
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,460
- Looks like a cloak and dagger tape.

368
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,213
- Well, it's not, take a look at it.

369
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,508
- What do you mean, it's not?

370
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,758
Who gave it to you?

371
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,138
- This guy, I can't tell
you any more than that.

372
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,475
- Top secret, huh?

373
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,228
What do you want me to do?

374
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,772
- I don't know, Morris,
you're the genius around here.

375
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,022
- All right.

376
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,495
This microchip doesn't belong here.

377
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,287
What?

378
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,538
Take a look.

379
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,750
Whoever put this in really
knew what he was doin'.

380
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,505
It could be used to store
information. Input, output.

381
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,675
What kind of information?
Government plans, maybe?

382
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,552
It could be anything, really.

383
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,805
I'll tell you one thing,
whoever put this in

384
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,682
really went through a lot of trouble.

385
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,309
- Think you can break the code?

386
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,565
The key is how
to get to it, I got an idea.

387
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,278
The guy who gave
it to me said something

388
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,072
What number?

389
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,161
One million
three-hundred twenty-nine...

390
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,306
I bet you anything
that's the secret code

391
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,081
that we're looking for.

392
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,083
Can you think of anything else?

393
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,585
- No.

394
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,420
Davey, are you alone?

395
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,353
- That reminds me,
Davey, I wanna get those

396
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,551
- sure, Morris.

397
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,190
Flack to lady ace. Come in, lady ace.

398
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm here.

399
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,692
- Kim, where are you?

400
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,360
Your house.

401
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,863
- Get out of there, the spies are there!

402
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,597
Seems we each have
something the other wants,

403
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,621
don't we, kid?

404
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,334
- Yeah.
- We might consider a trade.

405
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,938
- Just leave her alone,
she doesn't know anything.

406
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,506
She does now, do you know

407
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,132
the Japanese sunken gardens?

408
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,385
- Yeah.
- Good.

409
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,796
We'll meet you there at noon.

410
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,263
If you tell anybody about this,

411
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,265
we'll break your little friend in half.

412
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,651
- Don't give it to him, Davey.

413
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,905
Rule number two: Never, never
play by the enemy's rules.

414
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,615
- I have to give 'em something.

415
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,169
It's called commandeering
necessary mission equipment.

416
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,675
- Just stop right there.

417
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,057
- Cut the crap, kid. Give me the tape.

418
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:51,191
- Come any closer and you're
gonna be diving for it.

419
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,449
- Now, are we gonna make a trade?

420
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,326
Or are we gonna start dropping things?

421
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,286
- Davey!

422
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,222
- Why do you want it so
bad? It's just a kid's game.

423
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,152
- Well, let's just say I'm a kid at heart.

424
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,934
- Why don't you go buy your own?

425
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,184
They don't cost much.

426
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,230
- Look, kid, don't outsmart yourself.

427
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,560
I got a couple of friends
and we play, too, you know.

428
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,359
If I don't hand that over to them by 5:30,

429
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,611
your little friend there is gonna die.

430
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,991
All right, just put it
down and I'll let her go.

431
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,993
- You let Kim go first.

432
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,497
- Sure, anything you say.

433
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,483
- Freeze, Turkey!

434
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,407
Take my advice, don't follow us.

435
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,977
Otherwise, I'll have to use this.

436
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,243
- You little punk!

437
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,417
- Boy, am I glad to see you!
- Come on!

438
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,799
- It's the wrong one!

439
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:55,315
Wonder what's going on.

440
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,201
Hurry up, let's get out of here!

441
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,418
Thank you.

442
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,668
Thank you.

443
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,221
- Thanks, Davey.
- What for?

444
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,598
- You saved my life.

445
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,159
- What were you doing in my house, anyway?

446
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,227
I thought you weren't coming over.

447
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,854
- I wasn't, but then I felt bad.

448
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,565
'Cause I hurt your feelings.

449
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,069
I was just mad 'cause you
got me in trouble yesterday.

450
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,823
And I thought you were dumb
'cause of all that murder stuff.

451
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,616
I never thought it could be real.

452
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,371
- I'm really sorry, Davey.

453
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,873
- That's okay, Kim,
it's gonna be all right.

454
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,629
Uh-oh!

455
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,195
I'm gonna get the tape now.

456
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,634
We have no further use for
the kid, do you understand?

457
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,344
Yes, I understand.

458
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,520
- We gotta get out of here.

459
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,832
I'll make 'em follow me,
you get to Morris as quickly

460
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,858
as you can and tell him what's happened.

461
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,502
- But they'll kill you if they catch you.

462
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,003
- No, they won't, I'm
the only one who knows

463
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,112
where the real tape is.

464
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,407
Sir, I gotta get off here.

465
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,909
- Sorry, junior, we're not
allowed to stop along here.

466
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,619
- But it's an emergency.

467
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,550
- It's only three blocks
to the bus station

468
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,540
and everybody gets off.

469
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,282
- Yeah, like I'm gonna throw...

470
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,640
Run, Davey, run!

471
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,068
- Why is he shooting at me?

472
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,947
- He must've found out
where the cartridge is.

473
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,832
- One million three-hundred twenty-nine.

474
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,987
That's it.

475
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,739
I'll be right there!

476
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,494
The following
material is for a-4 security

477
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,120
clearance personnel only.

478
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,124
It is a federal crime
to view such material

479
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,378
- without proper authorization.
- Bingo.

480
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,285
I said I'd be right there.

481
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,928
- You looking for something?

482
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:54,887
- Someone's trying to kill me.

483
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,141
Well, why don't
you kill them first?

484
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,060
- Don't encourage him, Henry,
your food's getting cold.

485
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,896
Would you please go away?

486
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,942
- Listen, I'm trying to contact
the FBI, would you help me?

487
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,571
- Get me a direct line to j. Edgar hoover.

488
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,573
This is an emergency.

489
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,050
Hoover's dead, Henry.

490
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,552
Oh, my god,
they've gotten hoover.

491
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,537
Now we're all goners.
Sorry, kid, can't help ya.

492
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,223
I need help with the tour.

493
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,394
The next day, you'll have
a lovely day for a tour

494
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,482
- stand still, Davey.

495
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:48,316
They wouldn't dare shoot at you

496
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,942
with all these people around here.

497
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,738
In fact, the more people,
the better. Over there.

498
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,491
Watch your step,
come on, move right in.

499
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,499
- Thank you.
- Thank you, enjoy your ride.

500
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,461
- One child?
- Yes, ma'am.

501
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,256
That'll be 50 cents.

502
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,008
Thank you, enjoy your ride.

503
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,593
Thanks.

504
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,887
- One adult, two children.

505
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,403
- I'll get him.
- No, just get in line.

506
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:35,654
Get in line.

507
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,033
- Hey, buddy, wait your turn.

508
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,728
- Let me get him out of there.

509
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,297
- No, no, just take it easy now, not now.

510
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,650
Well, just
don't bring it up again.

511
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,425
No, you bring it up.

512
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,930
Wish your mother'd come to this.

513
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,684
Tickets, please.

514
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,405
Ticket, sir, hey, here you go.

515
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,793
Sorry, sir, all full, you'll
have to wait for the next boat.

516
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,211
We want this one.

517
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,589
I'm sorry, I can't
take any more passengers.

518
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,341
There'll be another boat
in 10 or 15 minutes.

519
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,864
- Howard, Howard, my wallet's gone!

520
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,115
Are you sure?

521
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,618
Of course I'm sure.

522
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,972
- Don't panic, don't panic.
- Look, we'll go back over every

523
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,724
step we've been over and see
if we can find it somewhere.

524
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:09,808
- Come on.
- You know it's gonna be gone.

525
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,032
You know what people are like.

526
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,086
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry.

527
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,195
- Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen.

528
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,638
My name is hal.

529
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,973
Now, our tour through the
downtown San Antonio river

530
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:29,018
shall take approximately 25 to 30 minutes.

531
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,080
If you have any questions or
anything you'd like to ask

532
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,233
me as we go along, please
do not hesitate to do so.

533
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,278
- I'm gonna get close to the boy.

534
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,489
When I give you the
signal, create a diversion.

535
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,157
- How?

536
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,033
- I don't care how, just as long as people

537
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:44,909
aren't looking at me.

538
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,994
- Which is the 10th
largest city in america.

539
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,664
With a population of
over one million people.

540
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:53,668
Famous world wide, the riverwalk
is the pride of the city.

541
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:02,176
Sir, would you kindly have a seat?

542
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,279
You're supposed to sit down.

543
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,303
- Thank you.

544
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,997
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to call your attention

545
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,423
to the building coming up
here to the left-hand side,

546
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,344
parties and fiestas are
held there almost every day

547
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,721
during the summer months.

548
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,098
- George.
- What?

549
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,348
- Look.

550
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,609
What's wrong, boy?

551
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,197
- You wouldn't believe
me if I told you, ma'am.

552
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,448
- Try me.

553
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,495
- That man over there
is trying to kill me.

554
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,122
Sir?

555
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,629
- Why?
- Because I said so, now move.

556
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,514
Looks like a pervert, if you ask me.

557
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,477
George, we've got to do
something about this.

558
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,204
The building here
to my right-hand side

559
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,147
is the old San Antonio library,

560
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,150
which contains the
huntsberg circus collection,

561
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,612
with over 20,000 exhibits
depicting American circus life.

562
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,406
The building that you see straight ahead,

563
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
the power and light building.

564
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:50,909
- Fire!
- Where?

565
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,035
- There, in the engine!

566
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:59,168
Please, everyone,
please, keep calm!

567
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,763
Everybody, please be seated.

568
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,613
Everybody, go back to your seats, please

569
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,058
and don't panic!

570
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,437
Go back to your seats, everybody, please!

571
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,687
Thank you.

572
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,650
Sir, you're all gonna have
to sit down, I'm sorry.

573
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:25,778
- Why don't you guys sit down and quit

574
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:26,695
- rockin' the boat?
- Sit down!

575
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,030
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

576
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,703
For your own
safety, please sit down.

577
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:17,455
- Kim!
- What happened to you?

578
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,723
- Nothing, where's Morris?

579
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,499
- I don't know, but look.

580
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,963
Davey, do you think they...

581
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,507
- No, Morris is too smart for them.

582
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,011
- I think he's already dead.

583
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,346
- Shut up, you don't know that!

584
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,766
I'm sorry.

585
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,397
- No use calling my dad.

586
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,151
Why don't you call your mom?

587
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,463
And tell her rice is gonna do something

588
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,239
with the tape at 5:30.

589
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,035
Make her call the police, even
if she doesn't believe you.

590
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,162
We need a grown up.

591
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,290
- Okay, what are you gonna do?

592
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,846
- I'm gonna try to find rice and stop him.

593
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,001
- How?

594
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,296
- I don't know yet.

595
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,159
Well, you gonna
stand here all day?

596
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,018
- I'm waiting for the light to change.

597
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:22,937
- Come on.

598
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,023
They won't hit you if
you just keep moving.

599
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,278
Crazy kid!

600
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,835
- Means he'll probably take his car.

601
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,170
There, textronics.

602
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,849
No place to hide in there, open the trunk.

603
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,739
Oh.

604
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:27,209
Oh, tough.

605
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,627
It's now or never, come on.

606
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,962
In there?

607
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,255
- Oh.
- Hurry up.

608
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,009
Hold it down, don't close
it shut, just hold it down.

609
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,380
- Jack?

610
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,673
Agent x, help.

611
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,384
Help me. Get him off me.

612
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,013
- Isn't it crowded enough for you in here?

613
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,562
- He was my friend, how
could they do that to him?

614
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,565
I guess he
just wasn't good enough.

615
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,817
- Yeah, but they didn't have to kill him.

616
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,228
- When you've been playing
this game as long as I have,

617
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,322
you get used to this kind of thing.

618
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:43,410
- We've stopped.

619
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,043
What happens now?

620
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,045
- We just wait a couple minutes.

621
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,855
I'll walk over there and make the drop.

622
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,465
- So who gets the game?

623
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,428
We just leave the case,
we wait a few minutes,

624
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,679
take the money.

625
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,325
Only thing I know about
these people is one of 'em's

626
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,476
missin' a couple fingers
from his right hand.

627
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,729
Well, remember the alamo, boys.

628
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,332
- Sure as hell don't tell you much.

629
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,356
Enough.

630
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,116
- It's time to go.

631
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,495
Remember, you can win or
lose the game right here.

632
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,376
Blue drops
back, he rolls to his right.

633
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,587
He's looking for summers
in the end zone...

634
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,260
He took quite a lick on that play as well.

635
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:45,013
Summers, fully extended,
just couldn't reach it.

636
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,141
Second and goal, Dallas.

637
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,160
Taxation without representation.

638
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,162
In fact, they were quite angry,

639
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,998
but they did not want to fight Santa Anna.

640
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,792
Instead, they tried to negotiate with him.

641
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,669
Content being citizens of Mexico,

642
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,421
all they wanted was the reinstatement

643
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,802
in 1835, negotiations
broke down and the texans

644
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,406
- began to talk of revolution.
- Hi, could you tell us where

645
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,055
- we could get some postcards?
- General Santa Anna

646
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,533
- heard this rumor...
- We are closing soon,

647
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,934
but the souvenir shop
is right through there.

648
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:31,810
- Thank you.
- General Martin perfecto

649
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,562
de cos, with 1,200 men

650
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,438
- occupied the alamo...
- How much time do we have

651
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,790
- before that tour bus leaves?
- And end the so-called

652
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:36,440
- revolution.
- Oh, we've got time, honey.

653
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,917
- Let's stop on by the shop.
- At that time,

654
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,069
the Texas revolution was
nothing more than a rumor.

655
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,072
General cos had the roof
torn off the chapel.

656
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,078
Along the back wall.

657
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,956
The ledge is the original
height of the wall.

658
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,167
The upper section was
added in later years.

659
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,711
General cos laid three
cannons along the back wall.

660
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,590
He had a total of 21
cannons inside the alamo.

661
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,467
Approximately 300 texans...

662
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,219
- Well, look who's here.

663
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,181
The last time I saw you,
you were jumping off a boat.

664
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,433
Were you feeling a little seasick?

665
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,702
- General cos men surrendered.
- I'm hiding from that man

666
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,853
- over there.
- They were allowed to return

667
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,314
- to Mexico...
- Oh, it's somebody new

668
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,234
this time, now, isn't it
about time you told me

669
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,698
Returned to their
farms and their families.

670
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:28,617
Ladies and gentlemen, the alamo

671
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,994
will be closing in two minutes.

672
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,498
- Our young friend
seems to be in some sort

673
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,748
of trouble again.

674
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:41,380
Now, here, just a minute,
what is your name?

675
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,756
- Davey.

676
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,509
- Not Davy Crockett by any chance?

677
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,765
- I really have to go now, it's a matter

678
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,725
of national security.

679
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,395
- Will everyone please exit
through the front door?

680
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,278
- What do you think?

681
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,405
- I think the boy needs our help.

682
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,285
Hey, stop that kid!

683
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,871
Oh, he's stealing
somebody's bag, get him!

684
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,916
- You got a hell of a nerve,
kid, stealing inside the alamo.

685
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,769
- I didn't steal it!
- He didn't steal anything,

686
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,169
- officer.
- He took this.

687
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,900
- Well, that's just a simple mistake.

688
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,132
I sent the boy in to
pick up my camera case

689
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,175
and he took the wrong one.

690
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,426
- Oh.

691
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,389
This yours?

692
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:36,268
Well, come and get it.

693
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,396
- Why don't you take
the boy over to the car

694
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,766
while I straighten this out?

695
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,942
But that one has
the secret cartridge in it!

696
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,527
- Come on.
- It's got the secret

697
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,447
- microchip in there.
- Don't worry about it.

698
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,198
George will take care of everything.

699
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:54,202
The car's only over here,
now, don't you fret yourself.

700
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,413
George will take care of everything.

701
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,290
He's very good at that.

702
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,468
He's giving him the camera case!

703
00:57:09,718 --> 00:57:10,719
- He is?

704
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,430
Well, if he did, he had
a reason for doing it.

705
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,483
Slide over, that's it.

706
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,737
- This what you're so worried about?

707
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,364
- No, sir.

708
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,174
It was the case you gave the other man.

709
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,117
That was the one with the plans in it.

710
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,585
- What makes you so sure I
gave the wrong case back?

711
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,631
- Why don't you open it and find out?

712
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:52,761
You got it!

713
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,514
- George always makes
things turn out right.

714
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,099
- But how'd you do it?

715
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,142
- Well, I just gave
that man my camera case

716
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,145
in its place, he never
noticed the difference.

717
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,523
Now, do you mind telling
us what this is all about?

718
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,733
After all, I sacrificed my good camera

719
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,236
to save your cloak and dagger tape.

720
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,655
- It isn't just a cloak and dagger tape.

721
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,991
There's an extra microchip in here.

722
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,410
- What was that man doing
with it at the alamo?

723
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,414
- Said he had to give
it to some foreign spy.

724
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,165
- Really?

725
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,252
Did he say what the spy looked like?

726
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,797
- Only that he had two fingers missing.

727
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,047
- How exciting!

728
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,011
May I see the tape, Davey?

729
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,387
- Sure.

730
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,688
- Something wrong, Davey?

731
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:55,698
- It's all right.

732
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:58,285
- Such a clever little boy.

733
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,828
Don't you think so, George?

734
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,206
I wish we could take him
to Mexico City with us.

735
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,585
- I made an arrangement with rice.

736
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:07,937
He's gonna take care of him for us

737
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,463
on the way to the airport.

738
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,593
- I don't like him and I
don't like his methods,

739
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,092
and I don't like those two thugs of his.

740
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,982
- I made it very clear to him back there.

741
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,056
We're very displeased
with this whole mess.

742
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,104
- I made that very clear.

743
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,315
What time's our flight?

744
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,565
- Midnight.

745
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,239
I'm afraid we won't be able to
use our dinner reservations.

746
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,974
- Wake up, someone's coming.
- Where are we?

747
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,374
I can't see a thing.

748
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,335
Right back where you put us.

749
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,729
Hey, pop the trunk, will you?

750
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,255
You better play
dead or you will be.

751
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,108
With five touchdown passes.

752
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,094
For Kyle, 19 completions
out of 23 attempts.

753
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:58,595
He had one high.

754
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,473
That's 318 yards.

755
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,557
- You wanna kill him now,
or wait 'til the chloroform

756
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,857
- wait 'til we get to the desert.

757
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,585
- What's taking rice so long, anyway?

758
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,609
It can't take him two hours
to divide up the money.

759
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,031
I think we should get
extra for killing the kid.

760
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,281
- You're right.

761
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,785
Let's go hurry him up.

762
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,773
We'll never get out of here.

763
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,132
Stay cool, I'm thinking.

764
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,800
What are we gonna do?

765
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,190
Open the door.

766
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,195
- What are you doing?

767
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,155
There's a phone here.

768
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,698
Let's get outta here.

769
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:00,948
- I'm calling Kim.

770
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,245
- We better get out of
here and find some weapons.

771
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:11,811
No, Kim, it's
me. Told your mom yet?

772
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:13,086
- No, she hasn't come home yet.

773
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,297
She left a note, but I
can't read her writing.

774
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,716
- Listen, you gotta get
to the airport right away.

775
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:18,966
The spies have the tape.

776
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,094
They're kinda old, a man and lady.

777
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,721
She only has three fingers.

778
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,055
- Where are you?

779
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,432
- I'm in a car.

780
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,351
Listen, they're catching a plane
to Mexico City at midnight.

781
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,282
- How am I supposed to get to the airport?

782
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,855
- Use your bus pass.

783
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,105
- Duck.

784
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,922
- I want you boys to pay
attention, you do what I tell ya.

785
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,586
Keep your mouths shut, there's a lot more

786
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,995
- what about the girl, you
want us to get her, too?

787
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,206
No, I already took care of that.

788
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,250
- Garage door opener.

789
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:56,122
- What are you gonna do,
crush her with a garage door?

790
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,213
- Not quite.

791
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,258
This is a trigger for a clock.

792
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,111
You can set off enough
plastique to blow up

793
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,335
her and half her neighborhood.

794
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,697
- You mighta told us, hell, we coulda been

795
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,721
blown up with her.

796
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,098
- That's why I use a timer.

797
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,853
I told that kid, if he
crossed me, she was gonna die.

798
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:15,106
So now, in exactly one
hour, our little friend's

799
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:18,652
gonna have a very short,
very loud nightmare.

800
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,158
- That'll be midnight.

801
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,910
- Yeah, I gotta call Kim.

802
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,880
- You go get the Van,
let's get these bodies

803
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,788
out of my trunk.

804
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,039
- Not now, you don't.

805
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,376
- Haverman's got the key.

806
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,503
I'll pop it open from
the glove compartment.

807
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,297
That's all right, I've got mine.

808
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,137
He was in
there five minutes ago.

809
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,931
- Great, Alvarez.

810
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,016
- Haverman, the kid's gone.

811
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,769
- All right, let's get outta here.

812
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,874
- You gotta tell me how
to drive this thing.

813
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:06,574
- I don't know, this is a real car.

814
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,339
Okay, so much for backing
up. Let's try forward.

815
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,843
Whoa!

816
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,472
Peel out, Davey.

817
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,585
- Don't shoot at my car!
- What are you, crazy?

818
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,071
- Well, that pretty well covers parking.

819
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,268
- Gimme me that, go get the Van.

820
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,605
- Let's go.

821
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,406
You're doing just fine, Davey.

822
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,696
Put the pedal to the metal!

823
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:37,874
Whoa!

824
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,187
- Take a right here, Davey.

825
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,694
Good, excellent.

826
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:10,532
Sweeper.

827
01:05:10,782 --> 01:05:12,575
Left, Davey! The sweeper, the sweeper!

828
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,480
- Kim's already left.

829
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,566
She's safe, come on, let's go.

830
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,068
- What if they planted the bomb on her?

831
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,318
- How?

832
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,867
- Lady ace, lady ace, come in.

833
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,245
- Hello, Davey. Hello, can you hear me?

834
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,832
- Why won't she answer?

835
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,835
- She probably dropped her walkie-talkie.

836
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,338
Walkie-talkie.

837
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,589
- Cheap thing.

838
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,011
- We gotta save Kim!
- Right there!

839
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:14,637
- Uh-oh.

840
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,891
First, we gotta find some
hardware and blast these guys.

841
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,517
- Come on.
- I'm calling dad.

842
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,871
- That guy thinks you're
a nutcase, come on.

843
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,355
Let's get out of here, come on!

844
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:36,659
- He's gone.

845
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,536
- No kidding, Alvarez.

846
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,163
- Give me the case.

847
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,143
- All right, just stay with
the Van, we'll go on foot.

848
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:46,669
He can't have gotten very
far. Come on, let's go.

849
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,174
- This is starting to get good.

850
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,437
- Just like cloak and dagger.

851
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,524
- Trying to kill us.

852
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,067
- They can't kill me.

853
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:10,317
They can't see me.

854
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,195
- They can kill me.

855
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,565
- Not if you're good enough.

856
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,907
That's what this game is all about, right?

857
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,157
- Right?
- Kelly field.

858
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,827
- Yes, I'd like to speak to
master sergeant hal Osborne,

859
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,704
please, it's his son calling.

860
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:22,580
- Just a minute.
- Come on, you're wasting

861
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,291
valuable combat time, let's go, come on.

862
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,668
- Yeah, thanks. Hello?

863
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,962
Dad, you gotta help me.

864
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,463
- Davey, why aren't you in bed?

865
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,873
- The spies, they planted a
bomb in Kim's walkie-talkie

866
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,069
- hang up, let's go, come on.
- Wait a minute, son.

867
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,595
Look, I told you I didn't want
you to get in those games.

868
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,932
- Dad, this is no game,
now, I need your help.

869
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,826
Davey, look,
I've got a rush job here,

870
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,036
- I do not have time...
- Would you listen to me?

871
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,829
- For this kind of stuff.
- They're trying to take

872
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,493
the plans out of the country at midnight.

873
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,708
- Just calm down, okay, I
don't want you to get worked up

874
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,110
again, I'll be home just as soon as I can.

875
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,695
- What'd I tell ya, he's useless.

876
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,114
- Dad, I'm not home. Now
please, just listen to me

877
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:59,867
for once, I promise you
I'm telling the truth.

878
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,198
Now, you don't have to worry
about me, but get to Kim

879
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,847
before the bomb goes off at midnight.

880
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,349
- Wait a minute, what do
you mean you're not home,

881
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,124
where are you?

882
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,014
- I don't know, I'm in a telephone booth.

883
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,979
Davey, now listen
carefully, I want you to stay

884
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:14,007
right where you are and don't
get out of that phone booth.

885
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:29,355
What's the matter with him?

886
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,858
- One down and two to
go, come on, get the gun.

887
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,109
No.

888
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,963
- Davey, come on, get with
it, we can win this game.

889
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,822
You gotta take advantage
of breaks like this.

890
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,073
Get the gun.

891
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,218
- We gotta get across town
and get a bus to the airport.

892
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,869
- Davey!
- Along the river.

893
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,119
It's the fastest way.

894
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,245
- Play right!

895
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,164
11:35, I'm not gonna make it in time.

896
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,542
- You're gonna have to
take these guys out.

897
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:32,919
You know that, don't you?

898
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,300
- All right, it's time
for the heavy artillery.

899
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,576
- Let me have it.
- You got it.

900
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,474
- Now, just wait right
here and take 'em out.

901
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,726
- I don't wanna kill anybody.

902
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,352
- Davey, you know the rules.

903
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:14,997
You're supposed to take out the obstacles

904
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,898
before reaching the objective.

905
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,109
Can't just go right for the
objective, that's no fun.

906
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,359
- Fun?

907
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,989
We got 24 minutes before
the bomb goes off.

908
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,783
- That's why you have to take 'em out.

909
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,413
Look, how many people have I
killed for you over the years?

910
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,266
And now you're saying
you don't wanna play?

911
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,851
Now come on, this is
cloak and dagger for real.

912
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:37,418
It's what you always wanted.

913
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,048
- Yeah, but I don't have a
gun or a knife or anything.

914
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,886
- The crossfire gambit,
remember the crossfire gambit?

915
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,429
Now go back down there and hide.

916
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,681
Wait 'til the first guy passes you.

917
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,017
Then get rice's attention
and lead his fire.

918
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,900
Davey, if you don't save
Kim, who's going to?

919
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,655
- Okay.

920
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:10,154
- Hey, ricey, what's the
matter? Can't shoot straight?

921
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,289
- Good work, Davey, now pick up the gun.

922
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,539
He's dead.

923
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,335
- Never mind that, you're winning.

924
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,337
Pick it up, come over here.

925
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:29,048
- My dad was right, I
don't wanna play anymore.

926
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,175
- Davey, don't chicken out now, come on!

927
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,471
Hurry up.

928
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,435
Good boy.

929
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,608
Wait, Davey, it's a dead end!

930
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,786
- Don't come any closer or I'll shoot.

931
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,289
- Sure you will, with red ink.

932
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,293
Only this one shoots real bullets.

933
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,050
- I'm warning you, this
is not a water pistol.

934
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,138
I could turn you into
shredded meat in about

935
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,432
three seconds with this
baby if I wanted to.

936
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,869
But you've been a real pain in the neck,

937
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:06,312
so I'm not gonna be that nice.

938
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,690
You know what I'm gonna do to you, boy?

939
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,692
I'm gonna blow both your kneecaps off.

940
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,071
It won't kill ya, but it'll hurt worse

941
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,822
than any dying you can imagine.

942
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,159
Then you know what I'm
gonna do to you, huh?

943
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,409
- Shoot him, Davey.

944
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,331
- I'm gonna shoot you in the stomach.

945
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,310
And then when you beg
for me to finish the job,

946
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,334
I won't do it.

947
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,838
I'm just gonna watch you die slowly.

948
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,548
- Shoot, pull the trigger.

949
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:40,221
- Please stop, I don't wanna shoot you.

950
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:41,680
- But I wanna shoot you.

951
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:47,436
- Kill him. The guy's a jerk, kill him.

952
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:50,979
All right, I'll show you
what a real hero would do.

953
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,237
Just get him to shoot over here, okay?

954
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,948
Agent x will bounce the
bullets right back at him.

955
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,201
Come on, come on, Turkey, shoot, come on.

956
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,995
Right here, hit me, pull the trigger!

957
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,247
- Jack, don't!

958
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:40,239
- Good work, Davey, you won.

959
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,782
- You're not dead.

960
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,072
- No, he never touched me.

961
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,911
I guess this thing
doesn't stop real bullets.

962
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,502
He could see you.

963
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,671
- I doubt if he had the imagination.

964
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,549
Anyway, who cares?

965
01:17:58,799 --> 01:17:59,799
You're a hero.

966
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:05,555
Hey, Davey.

967
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:09,185
Look, you killed the bad
guys, you won the game.

968
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,437
Well, how do you feel?

969
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:16,066
- That wasn't fair, you tricked
me, you made me kill him!

970
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,695
Now come on, let's go to the airport.

971
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,324
- I don't wanna play anymore!

972
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:29,955
I see.

973
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:33,083
Why do kids always say that?

974
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,961
- Your father said the same thing.

975
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,924
After all those games of
cowboys and Indians...

976
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:44,803
You get tired of make
believe, you break your toys.

977
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,063
- He did hit you.

978
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,513
- I'm okay, come on, let's go.

979
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,357
- But you're bleeding.

980
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,607
- I'm okay, come on.

981
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:05,741
I'll tell you what, Davey.

982
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:09,245
Maybe you better go on up
to the airport without me.

983
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,580
- No, I can't.
- No, no, no, listen.

984
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,374
You're a hero now, Davey.

985
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,126
You don't need an old jelly
blaster like me anymore.

986
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:18,754
- Don't say that, you'll be fine.

987
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,260
Leaving when they stop believing.

988
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,762
- Maybe I better go get some help.

989
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,472
- No, no, no, don't go.

990
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,643
They wouldn't be able to see me, anyway.

991
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:38,399
Well, fun while it lasted
anyway, wasn't it, pal?

992
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,987
But Jack flack always escapes.

993
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:45,906
- Wanna know something?

994
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,182
You're the best playmate I ever had.

995
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,041
You can't leave, Jack.

996
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,626
- I have to, kid.

997
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,421
You're growing up now.

998
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,427
Do me a favor, will ya?

999
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,389
Go get me a smoke.

1000
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,951
- Jack, where are you?

1001
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,834
Come back, I can't do it on my own.

1002
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,961
Yes, you can.

1003
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,546
You were always on your own.

1004
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,090
Save Kim, Davey.

1005
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,349
The white zone

1006
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,434
is for the immediate loading and unloading

1007
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,854
of passengers only, there is no parking.

1008
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,126
- Hi, I'm David Osborne's father.

1009
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,754
- Oh, yes, I know.
- Is Kim here?

1010
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:25,464
- Isn't she at your house?

1011
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,714
- No, she's not.

1012
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,509
Look, I just got a call

1013
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:29,861
- from David.
- Come here, I wanna show

1014
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:30,636
you something.

1015
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,406
I just got back here and look at this.

1016
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,140
Is this another one of your son's games?

1017
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,393
- No, I don't think so.

1018
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,145
I need the phone.

1019
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,396
- What is it?
- Operator.

1020
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,899
- Operator, let me have the
police, this is an emergency.

1021
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:47,379
- Police.
- Yes, my name is sergeant

1022
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,114
Osborne, I'd like to speak
to lieutenant Fleming.

1023
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,124
- Is it Kim? Is she...
- Lieutenant Fleming's

1024
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,409
been trying to reach you.

1025
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,369
- Why is he trying to reach me?

1026
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,763
Two men are
dead down at the river.

1027
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,163
They were shooting at a young boy.

1028
01:21:58,414 --> 01:21:59,665
- Jesus.
- What is it?

1029
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:00,666
I'll have him call you.

1030
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,394
- No, no, wait a minute, I'll hold on.

1031
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,853
If you can connect me with the lieutenant,

1032
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:04,877
I'll hold on, okay?

1033
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,243
All right, hang on.

1034
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,231
They were shooting at a kid Davey's age.

1035
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,178
You and me gotta get to the airport fast.

1036
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,337
- Sir, which is the airport bus?

1037
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,185
- That one over there.

1038
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,377
- Is this the bus to the airport?

1039
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,569
- Uh-huh.

1040
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,070
- I lost my bus pass.

1041
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
- 75 cents.

1042
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,198
- I don't have it.

1043
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,826
- Have to get off then,
can't let you ride for free.

1044
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,953
- But you have to!

1045
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,806
Listen, I'll pay you when
I get to the airport.

1046
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,830
- Sorry.

1047
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,216
Flight 146 to Mexico City

1048
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,094
is about to board at gate 15, concourse b.

1049
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:55,344
- Thanks.

1050
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,607
- Mister, take me to the airport.

1051
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:07,983
- You got any money, son?

1052
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:09,942
- Yeah, lots.

1053
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,573
- I don't have that
much, but I have to get

1054
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,992
- to the airport.
- Forget it, kid.

1055
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,498
- Listen, I don't have any money,

1056
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,750
but I gotta get to the airport.

1057
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,211
I'll find some way to pay
you when we get there.

1058
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,838
- What happened to your leg?

1059
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:31,631
- Nothing.

1060
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:33,485
- Look, maybe we better
get you to a hospital.

1061
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,469
That leg doesn't look too good.

1062
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,012
- I don't have time for that.

1063
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,389
If I don't get to the
airport, a girl is gonna die.

1064
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,391
- Get in.

1065
01:23:43,644 --> 01:23:46,855
I was going home that way, anyway.

1066
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:48,273
- How long will it take?

1067
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,861
- This time of night? About 10 minutes.

1068
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:56,775
- But you have to stop them
from getting on the plane.

1069
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,660
You see, they have the c and d tape.

1070
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,230
- What?
- A cloak and dagger tape.

1071
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:03,997
You know, a game cartridge,
only it has stolen

1072
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:05,290
government plans in it.

1073
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,893
- What does this couple look like?

1074
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:10,045
- I don't know, kinda old, the
woman only has two fingers.

1075
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,422
Maybe it was three, I forget.

1076
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,675
Look, will you just stop
that plane from boarding

1077
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,176
before they take off in it?

1078
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:34,443
11:47.

1079
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:38,407
Can't we go any faster? I
only have a few more minutes.

1080
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:39,657
- Yes, sir, boss.

1081
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,060
- You mind hand-searching that?

1082
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,712
I don't want to put it through
that electrical doodad.

1083
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,064
- That's all the description you've got?

1084
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,844
- I told you, we got cut off!

1085
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:03,098
Look, all you gotta do is
check their fingers, jeez.

1086
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:07,853
Transcon flight 146
now boarding at gate 15.

1087
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,438
- That's their flight!

1088
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,357
- All right, let me
just get this down here.

1089
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,077
- Wait here, I'll find
some way to pay you.

1090
01:25:24,328 --> 01:25:25,704
- Forget it, kid.

1091
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,834
- Thanks.

1092
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:40,886
Southwest flight 2
arriving from houston/austin.

1093
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,639
- All right, thank you.
- Arriving at gate 12.

1094
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:44,973
- How do I find somebody?

1095
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,583
- Why don't you tell me their
name and I'll have them paged.

1096
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,469
Kim gardener, please
report to the information

1097
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:54,524
counter, Kim gardener to
the information counter.

1098
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:10,749
- Did they just call my name?

1099
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,101
- I don't know, I wasn't listening.

1100
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,294
What's your mother's
name and phone number?

1101
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,672
- I think they just said,
Kim gardener, that's me.

1102
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,925
- Just a couple more questions, okay?

1103
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,630
- Excuse me, have you seen
a little girl around eight?

1104
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,265
Is she boarding on this flight?

1105
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,184
- Stop them!
- Hey!

1106
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,061
- Whoa, just a second, there, son.

1107
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,497
But they have the cartridge!

1108
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:33,790
Hey, I'm sorry,
son, you'll just have to go

1109
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:34,854
around and wait your turn.

1110
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:36,065
Who you with, anyway?

1111
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,652
- Mom, dad, please don't leave me!

1112
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,195
- They your folks?

1113
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:44,533
Just a minute there, folks.

1114
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:46,576
Would you mind coming back here, please?

1115
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:49,663
- Plane's already boarding.

1116
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,582
- It'll wait, let's get
this straightened out first.

1117
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:56,336
Transcon flight
6 from miami/atlanta

1118
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,672
is now arriving at gate 17.

1119
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,177
- Is this your boy?

1120
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:07,180
- Do we look like we
could have a boy that age?

1121
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,600
- You putting me on, son?

1122
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,603
- No, sir, I can prove they're my folks.

1123
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:14,854
- How?

1124
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:17,107
- Look inside that bag over there

1125
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,485
and you'll find one of my game
cartridges, cloak and dagger.

1126
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,238
- May I see that bag, please?

1127
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,365
- Officer, this boy is lying.

1128
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,746
I still would
like to see that bag.

1129
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,247
Will you give it to me, please?

1130
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,082
Okay, thank you.

1131
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,876
- Kim!
- Davey!

1132
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:39,129
Give me your walkie-talkie.

1133
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:41,214
He grabbed the gun!

1134
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:42,734
Eunice, grab the kid!

1135
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,843
- No, you don't.
- The little boy!

1136
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,887
Please stay back.

1137
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:48,638
- Stay where you are!

1138
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:50,515
- This thing has a...

1139
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:54,019
Zone is for the
immediate loading and unloading

1140
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,481
of passengers only, there is no parking.

1141
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,534
- Here, lieutenant, take a look at this.

1142
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,411
- What do you got?

1143
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:13,663
- Come on.
- Passengers only.

1144
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,499
There is no parking.

1145
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:20,271
- We will begin boarding passengers seated

1146
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,005
in rows one through 15.

1147
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:24,299
What's going on here?

1148
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,020
Ow, my leg!

1149
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,897
Davey, Davey!

1150
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:43,193
Out of the way, you!

1151
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,309
- They're wanted by the FBI
for selling military secrets,

1152
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,824
which were smuggled in
chi ldren's video cartridges.

1153
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:50,283
- Well, what about my son?

1154
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,330
- They've got divers down there now.

1155
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,585
Did this belong to him?

1156
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:01,938
Forget the luggage,
let's get out of here.

1157
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,298
- Someone's been shooting.
- What's going on here?

1158
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,549
- God.

1159
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:08,820
- What's going on?
- Why didn't I believe him?

1160
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,221
- Hijacking on 15, lieutenant Fleming?

1161
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:14,599
- Hijacking at gate 15.
- Hijacking?

1162
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,822
- We're going to code 3, code 3.

1163
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:31,825
- Lieutenant Fleming, what happened?

1164
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:33,427
- Two people kidnapped a
little boy, they have him

1165
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,720
on the plane, they're holding him hostage.

1166
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:35,744
- Kim!
- Mom!

1167
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:39,249
- Oh, honey, I was so worried about you.

1168
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:40,083
Give me some confirmation on that.

1169
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,835
- They've got Davey out there.

1170
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:43,365
As soon as you can, yes.

1171
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,130
- What did they say?

1172
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,484
- If they can't get a
pilot to fly 'em to Cuba

1173
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,760
within five minutes,
they're gonna kill him.

1174
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:52,761
- My god.

1175
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,015
- What are you gonna do?

1176
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,576
- The FBI is sending over
their resident agent.

1177
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,994
- Well, how long before he gets here?

1178
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,858
- It'll be a few minutes,
I just talked to him.

1179
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,899
That may be too late, my
son's on that airplane.

1180
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:05,389
- He says we got three minutes.

1181
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:06,860
- He's bluffing.

1182
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,404
- He's bluffing with my son's
life, let me go out there.

1183
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:10,974
- What?
- I'm a staff sergeant out

1184
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:12,236
at Kelly field, I've got my

1185
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:12,991
- own ground crew.
- I'm sorry.

1186
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,910
- I'm licensed to taxi airplanes.

1187
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,160
- Forget it.

1188
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:20,165
- I think he's flipping out, what do I do?

1189
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,794
- Tell him a pilot's comin' out there.

1190
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,285
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1191
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,526
They might even buy the
uniform, but what happens

1192
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,928
when they expect you to
take that plane in the air?

1193
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,931
- I'll fake it.
- Fake it?

1194
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,269
- One more minute, and I
blow this kid's brains out!

1195
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,314
- But this thing has a...
- Go sit in the back, shut up!

1196
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,149
Shut up, shut up!

1197
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:49,194
George, remember
your blood pressure.

1198
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:52,280
That darn kid's
messing everything up.

1199
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,950
Calm down, as
long as we've got the boy,

1200
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,701
they'll have to give us a pilot.

1201
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:08,713
- Which one do I pull?

1202
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,597
Here comes someone now.

1203
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:27,731
- Oh.

1204
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:37,242
Jack, please come back, I
didn't mean to throw you away.

1205
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:38,994
I need your help.

1206
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:39,953
Who are you?

1207
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,705
I'm the pilot, I'm not armed.

1208
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,748
Turn around.

1209
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,627
- Where's the boy?

1210
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:48,628
He's all right, he's back there.

1211
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:49,963
He's clean.

1212
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:52,507
Close the door.

1213
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,259
Get in the cockpit.

1214
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:59,597
No funny business, or
I'll blow your head off.

1215
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:13,403
Watch him, George.

1216
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,538
- Help me, Jack.

1217
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,879
- What are you doin'?

1218
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,548
- I have to pressurize the
cabin, the switch is over there.

1219
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:53,026
I have to call the tower
now to get permission

1220
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:54,694
to take off, is that all right?

1221
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:02,577
San Antonio tower, this is flight 146.

1222
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,582
San Antonio tower, this is flight 146.

1223
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:10,794
- Jack, please come back,
I can't do this on my own.

1224
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:12,587
- I need your help.
- Flight 146.

1225
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:15,964
- Jack.

1226
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:20,845
- Request permission to
taxi over to runway 15,

1227
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:32,190
Jack, please come
back, I need your help.

1228
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,160
- This is captain Jack
flack, David Osborne,

1229
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:35,860
get up to the cockpit right away.

1230
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:38,613
- What's the big idea? You
don't have to see the kid.

1231
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,865
- They told me to make
sure the boy was all right

1232
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,081
- Come on.

1233
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,457
You're wanted up front.

1234
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,227
- But the bomb goes off
in less than a minute.

1235
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,002
- Come on, junior. Now!

1236
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:10,603
- Davey, get up here right away!

1237
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:12,147
- Dad!
- Oh, no you don't!

1238
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:14,023
Let me go!

1239
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,780
Look, it's moving!

1240
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:25,785
- Okay, Davey.

1241
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:27,120
- George!

1242
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:29,998
Forget the boy and get back here!

1243
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:35,044
Well, disarm it!

1244
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,263
- I don't know how.

1245
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,807
- It's still going, the door!

1246
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:53,396
We gotta get you outta here.

1247
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:56,917
- Not with the cabin pressurized.

1248
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,443
- Oh, George!

1249
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:03,406
Open up in there!

1250
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:04,736
You'll never fit.

1251
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,260
Never mind me, I'll be all right.

1252
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:07,924
Dad, I'm not going without you!

1253
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,078
Now take my hand.

1254
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,329
Take my hand.

1255
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,459
No, no, no!

1256
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,965
No, dad, I'm not leaving without you!

1257
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:22,842
Let go of my hands!

1258
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:24,928
No, I'm not leaving!

1259
01:35:25,178 --> 01:35:27,281
When you hit the
ground, run away from the plane!

1260
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,848
- Dad, come with me!

1261
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,261
- Dad!
- Son!

1262
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,266
- How'd you escape?

1263
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,811
- Jack flack always escapes.

1264
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:01,566
- I don't need him
anymore, I've got you, dad.
