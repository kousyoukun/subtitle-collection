1
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Ivan,

2
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,610
Unh!

3
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,490
Spasibo.

4
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,540
Mein herr! Ach!

5
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,710
Aah!

6
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,660
Whoa-oh!

7
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,600
Jack Flack escapes.

8
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,130
How could
he escape?

9
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,670
Look at
the dice.

10
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,570
So what?

11
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,710
24. Jack's agility
is 24. He escapes.

12
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,110
That's not fair.

13
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,110
I got killed, and you
should have been dead.

14
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,250
I'm not. Jack Flack
always escapes.

15
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,620
Dumb game.

16
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,720
You just got to develop
better moves, Kim, that's all.

17
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,750
You're getting there.

18
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,070
I don't believe this.
How can he do it, Morris?

19
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,190
I had 10 times as many
bullets as Jack Flack.

20
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,130
Yeah, but Flack had the
ingenuity and the contacts, Kim.

21
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,070
It's better than
bullets sometimes.

22
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,030
Hey, don't feel bad.

23
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,270
I haven't been able
to beat him all summer.

24
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,840
What happens next,
Morris?

25
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
Let's leave it
for now.

26
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,240
I want to think of
something really good

27
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,140
to get you with.

28
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,680
Anyway, I want to
get back to my game.

29
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,010
Don't look at me.

30
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,810
I'm sick of
getting killed.

31
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,950
We could trade.

32
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,850
I'll give you extra gas masks
and a bulletproof vest.

33
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,650
No way.

34
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,820
You never get hurt.
It's no fun.

35
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,990
Jack Flack always
escapes anyway.

36
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,450
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

37
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,740
Hey, guys, be careful
with those.

38
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,870
I just got them in.

39
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,180
This is Jack Flack
requesting an assignment.

40
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,010
Over.

41
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,180
* Hello
everybody.

42
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,010
Ha ha ha!

43
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,950
Come on, Kim,
be serious.

44
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,850
You guys want
a real assignment?

45
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,190
You got
your bus passes?

47
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,170
Ok, I want you to
go over to Textronics.

48
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,160
Pick me up some catalogues
for the new 4200.

49
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,300
Come on, Morris.

50
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Give us
something exciting,

51
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,830
like Cloak and Dagger,

52
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,430
only for real.

53
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,440
Ok.

54
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,180
I want you to infiltrate
their seventh level.

55
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,050
Mm-hmm.

56
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,280
Then go to their
vending machine.

57
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,520
Pick me up
a pack of Twinkies.

58
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,320
Ohh...

59
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,190
There's a secret
message inside.

60
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,990
Hmm.

61
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,190
Whatever you do,

62
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,200
don't let anybody
see you. Anybody.

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,200
You coming?

64
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,430
Not if you're gonna be
embarrassing.

65
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,300
I won't.

66
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,650
Let's see.

67
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,010
Grenade...

68
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,470
gun...

69
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,480
ammo.

70
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,580
Ok.

71
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,280
Now what
are you doing?

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,150
Jack Flack says to always
keep your gun loaded.

73
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,820
Morris, could we try
these out?

74
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,490
Yeah. Just
don't break 'em.

75
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Time to go, Jack.

76
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,270
See you, Morris.

77
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh, great.

78
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,530
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

79
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,640
Yeah, what?

80
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,610
Come on, Kim.
Play right.

81
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,410
All right.

82
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,840
Lady Ace
to Jack Flack.

83
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,310
Do you read me?

84
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,580
Loud and clear.

85
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,550
Prepare to penetrate
the enemy stronghold.

86
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,750
Follow me in.

87
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,350
This is what I meant
by "embarrassing."

88
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,850
Hey!

89
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,200
You proceed to floor 7
for Operation Catalog.

90
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,970
I'll get the secret
from the machine.

91
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,770
Wait a minute.

92
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,680
I think that sentry
spotted us.

93
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,410
Davey, put that away.

94
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,830
Hi, kids.

95
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,050
You lost?

96
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,020
If you tell me
who you're looking for,

97
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,150
maybe I can help.

98
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,150
We're looking
for Textronics.

99
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,390
Ah. You're looking
for the Game Division?

100
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,490
Seventh floor.

101
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,260
Thank you,
Officer.

102
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,270
We'll take
separate routes

103
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,070
just in case one of us
is neutralized.

104
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,270
I'll take the fire stairs,
you take the elevator.

105
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,310
Good, 'cause I'm
not walking up.

106
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,100
Pardon me.

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,240
What's
the matter now?

108
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,740
That guy had a gun, Kim,
and it was a real gun.

109
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,410
Oh, Davey, will
you stop it?

110
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,550
Honest!
I saw a gun!

111
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,150
You're really
being a jerk.

112
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,590
Well, here. Take this
grenade just in case.

113
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,560
Thanks, anyway.

114
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,420
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

115
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,270
Yeah, Davey,
what is it?

116
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,820
I'm almost
in position.

117
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,160
Give me
your location.

118
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm already up here,
and I'm waiting for you.

119
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,910
Textronics.
Mr. Rice's office.

120
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,510
Ok. Start creating
a diversion.

121
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,100
I'll sneak out
the fire stairs

122
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,970
and hit the machine.

123
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,740
* Davey, this
is embarrassing *

124
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,510
Maintain radio silence
from now on.

125
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,640
Over and out.

126
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,980
Don't let him
leave the building.

127
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,590
Rice...
moving to the elevator.

128
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,590
Intercepting fully.

129
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,420
Hello?

130
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,340
Will there be
anything else today?

131
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,060
Ah, do you have
a food machine here?

132
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,460
Lady Ace,
Lady Ace, come in.

133
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,830
Excuse me.

134
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,370
Textronics.

135
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,010
Mr. Rice is
in a meeting.

136
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,770
I thought we were
maintaining radio silence.

137
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,380
Did you hear them?

138
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,250
No. I'm busy.
Now stop bugging me.

139
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,520
Uh, the vending machines
are right over there.

140
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,630
So your friend cut off
radio contact, did she?

141
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,230
Oh. Hi, Jack.

142
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,350
Well, some people
just don't know

143
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,470
how to act on
a secret mission.

144
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,630
I guess we're better off

145
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,440
just handling this one
on our own.

146
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,300
Like the Maracaibo assignment.
Remember that?

147
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,510
Back when I was known
as Agent X.

148
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,140
That was
a close one.

149
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,310
Yeah...

150
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,650
Yeah. There we were,

151
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,350
surrounded by hordes
of angry mercenaries.

152
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,580
All you had was
a ball of string

153
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,470
and a sealed I.O.U.
from the embassy.

154
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,150
And then there was
a letter bomb.

155
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,760
Yeah, that's 'cause
I told you not to trust them.

156
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,520
That's what I mean
about working alone.

157
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,430
I guess
you're right.

158
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,230
Yeah...

159
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,590
Help...me.

160
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,300
Here. Here...

161
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,670
Whatever happens,

162
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,570
don't let them get it.

163
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,990
Tell the FBI...

164
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,410
1 million, 329...

165
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,580
Run!

166
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,590
Aah!

167
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,770
Davey, what
are you doing?

168
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,470
They just killed a man,
now they're after me!

169
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,960
I got Morris'
Twinkie...

170
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,440
Help, police!
Murder!

171
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,350
What's the
problem, kid?

172
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,350
There's 2 men,
they're trying to kill me.

173
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,320
What men?

174
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
They're up there!
They just killed a man!

175
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,720
Call the police!

176
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,360
He was right here!
I saw him fall!

177
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,260
I had to run
right by him!

178
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,960
You want to tell me
what is this all about?

179
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,670
Well, these Nazis, or
some kind of bad guys,

180
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,700
they shot
this FBI man.

181
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,270
Nazis?

182
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,570
How should I know?
Maybe they were Russians,

183
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,440
but they shot him,

184
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,780
and he was bleeding,
and he fell.

185
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,810
I knew he was dead.

186
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,750
Look,
I'm not kidding you!

187
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,720
I can prove it.

188
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,750
He gave me this
secret cartridge...

189
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,620
No, no, no.

190
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,490
Don't trust him, Dave.

191
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,960
That's the first rule
of espionage.

192
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,430
Always stay true
to your source.

193
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,460
Secret what?

194
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,460
Well?

195
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,730
Never mind.

196
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,540
Hi, Mr. Rice.
Hi, Purdy.

197
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,770
Did you see anybody
on the terrace level?

198
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,310
No, not a soul.

199
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,180
Hi.

200
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,910
We better hold him
for the police.

201
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,680
We better go talk
to the police.

202
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,720
Come on.

203
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Ok, folks,
step back.

204
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,620
Clear the area.

205
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,720
Thank you.

206
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,980
I better be
going now.

207
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,350
You gonna be
all right?

208
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,730
Yeah. I've got a key.

209
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,030
Ok.

210
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,750
Davey, I've been calling
all over the place for you.

211
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,650
Mr. Osborne,

212
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,490
Lieutenant Fleming,
San Antonio PD.

213
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,390
Dad, I didn't do...

214
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,920
Just wait a minute,
ok? Let him talk.

215
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,210
What's...come on in.

216
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,290
Not at this time.

217
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,390
I've got to keep an ear
out for the squawk box.

218
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,410
Oh. Well, go on
to your room, Davey.

219
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,120
Dad, I want to hear
what he has to say...

220
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,830
Just go to your room,
Davey, all right?

221
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,740
What, uh...

222
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
What...what
happened?

223
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,790
Well, your son
created quite a stir

224
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,680
at the Tower Life
Building this morning

225
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,080
when he reported
a murder.

226
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
A murder?

227
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,460
That's right, sir.
We checked out his story

228
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,650
and found absolutely
no credence to it.

229
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,620
Then we tried
to bring him home,

230
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,240
but he refused to
divulge the whereabouts

231
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,860
of what he called,
um, "Headquarters."

232
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,920
Sorry, Officer,
but he does, uh,

233
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,260
do that sometimes.

234
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,660
We got them right
where we want them.

235
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,830
Huh?

236
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
Let 'em think
you're nuts.

237
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,980
See, if we're
gonna be heroes,

238
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,330
we got to keep
a low profile.

239
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,000
No cops, no dads,
we're on our own, pal.

240
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,670
There gonna be any
charges, or what?

241
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,810
Not this time, sir,

242
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,540
but we do think that
you ought to consider

243
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,640
getting him some help.

244
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,710
I have.

245
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,680
For almost an hour,
all he would give us

246
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,330
is his name, rank,
and serial number.

247
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,980
The tougher we got,
the tougher he got.

248
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,880
Good.

249
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,770
If it hadn't been
for the little girl,

250
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,650
we would've never
gotten him home.

251
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,460
Officer, I...

252
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,460
They'll sing
a different tune

253
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,430
once you're a hero.

254
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,530
...stuff like this
with parents a lot.

255
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,530
He is a good boy.

256
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,300
He's just...

257
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,600
going through a real
tough time right now.

258
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,770
He lost his
mother recently.

259
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh.

260
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,540
I guess we're both
having a little difficulty

261
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,010
making an adjustment.

262
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,510
Well, I can say
one thing for him.

263
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,650
If we were at war,

264
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,850
I'd want him
on my side.

265
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,650
You ready to talk?

266
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,600
Want to talk
about the murders?

267
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,900
They weren't murderers.
They were spies.

268
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,000
They'd gone there to
kill an FBI agent.

269
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,240
I just intercepted one
of their communications.

270
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,080
Anybody else see 'em?

271
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,110
If mom were here,
she'd believe me.

272
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,370
She probably would.

273
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,050
But she's not here,

274
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,660
and she's not
gonna be here.

275
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,260
We've gotta get
used to that.

276
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,560
I miss her.

277
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,860
I know.

278
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,830
We both miss her.

279
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,970
I bet she knows it.

280
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,740
I'll bet she can see us
right now, you know that?

281
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
Listen,
I've got an idea.

282
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,020
Why don't you and me

283
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,690
call up Dr. Sullivan
tomorrow?

284
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,810
You just tell him
what you saw today.

285
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,930
Just...just to see what
he says about it.

286
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,030
Jack Flack was right.

287
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,930
You do think I'm crazy.

288
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,360
You still talking
to Jack Flack?

289
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,700
Sometimes.

290
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,610
Davey, you've
got to understand:

291
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,010
Jack Flack
is make-believe,

292
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,180
just like all these
ridiculous games.

293
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,350
They don't make it
any easier for you

294
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,120
to get a grasp
on things.

295
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,890
Want to see something?

296
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,090
See proof?

297
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,460
Let me show you.

298
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,790
This is what
the FBI man gave me.

299
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,470
Hey, come here.

300
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,730
There's something
coming on.

301
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,710
More Cloak and Dagger?

302
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,880
What did I just get
through telling you...

303
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,540
Dad,
this is important.

304
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,110
Just wait a minute.
You'll see.

305
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,710
Oh, Davey...

306
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,550
Just give me
a chance.

307
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,730
A man was just
killed for this.

308
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,720
Do you want me
to play it once?

309
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,860
All right, play it.
Play it one time.

310
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,090
See, that's Dr. Boom
and that's Jack Flack

311
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,230
going to the secret
underground bomb factory.

312
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,070
Have you seen this
or done this before?

313
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,230
Yeah. I played it
at Morris'.

314
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,050
Now, here we are.

315
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,940
Get the guards.

316
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,240
Got one!

317
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,050
Ok, get the case...

318
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,380
I'd like to figure
this one out.

319
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,050
And I made it.

320
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,790
And where's the proof
you're talking about?

321
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,590
I don't know.

322
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,190
Maybe it's on
the next level.

323
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,810
Now let's shut it off,
all right? Come on.

324
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,740
But I get another life.

325
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,740
Let's just shut it
off. That's enough...

326
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,550
Dad!

327
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,980
I want you to
get ready for bed.

328
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,280
Can I just play
one more?

329
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,080
Davey, I said no
and I mean no.

330
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,050
Now,
get ready for bed.

331
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,920
I hate you.

332
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,870
I know you don't
mean that, son.

333
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,170
You don't
care about me.

334
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,320
Huh! You never
believe me.

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,230
Davey,
when I was a kid,

336
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,140
I was exactly
like you are.

337
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,610
I wanted to be a hero.

338
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,380
That's why
I joined the Air Force.

339
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,040
So I could
be somebody.

340
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,610
Let me tell you
something, Davey.

341
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,430
Heroes don't
just shoot bad guys,

342
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,050
they...they put
supper on the table,

343
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,390
they fix bicycles,
they do boring things...

344
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,330
real things,
not make believe.

345
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,850
I hope
you'll understand that

346
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,360
when you get
a little bit older.

347
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,300
Now, I'm going to
put these games away.

348
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,040
I don't want you
playing 'em anymore.

349
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,250
Dad, if you'd just play
one with me sometime.

350
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,850
Good night, Davey.

351
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,930
Not too smart for
a military man, huh?

352
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,340
Shut up.

353
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,760
Unh!

354
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,270
Will you get that
for me, Davey?

355
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,040
Hello?

356
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,150
Is this
David G. Osborne?

357
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,000
Yes.

358
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,650
Good.

359
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,990
Dad!
Yeah?

360
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,060
It's them!
It's the spies.

361
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,120
The ones
who killed the man!

362
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,650
Hurry!

363
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,400
Hello.

364
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,520
They hung up.

365
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,640
What'd he say?

366
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,640
Just asked
who I was.

367
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,140
Dad, they know
where I am.

368
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Ah, it's just a wrong number.
Come on, let's...

369
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,210
No, it wasn't!

370
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,380
I know
it was them.

371
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,810
Come on, come on,
take it easy.

372
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,920
Just go on to bed.
It's way past your bedtime.

373
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,490
Can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

374
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,290
What?

375
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,090
Can I sleep in
your bed tonight?

376
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,100
What for?

377
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
Well, I don't think
those, uh,

378
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,600
guys will come in
when you're here.

379
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,010
You don't, eh?

380
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,010
Ok, come on.

381
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,250
Everything's
going to be ok, son.

382
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Dad!

383
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,810
What is it, son?

384
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,420
Don't leave.

385
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Well, I've got
to go to work, son.

386
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,090
I don't have
any choice.

387
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,060
Well, they're just
waiting for you to leave

388
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,990
so they can get me.

389
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,230
Yeah...

390
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,100
Listen, I, um...

391
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,270
I talked to Dr. Sullivan
this morning,

392
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,370
and I made
an appointment

393
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,300
for us to see him
tomorrow, ok?

394
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,200
Humor him, Davey.

395
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,070
This turkey's
not gonna help us.

396
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,390
We're on our own.

397
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,510
And I got to...

398
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,080
I got to work
a double shift today

399
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,440
on account of
that big inspection

400
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
I told you about,
but tomorrow I'm off

401
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,550
so I can go to
the doctor with you,

402
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,280
and you can tell him...

403
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,720
everything you told me
about those spies.

404
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,290
Can't I
go with you?

405
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,190
Davey...

406
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,120
Come on,
you're a big boy now.

407
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,130
I mean, you're old enough
to stay home alone

408
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,560
without kicking
a fuss, aren't you?

409
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
I'll tell you what:

410
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,100
Maybe next week we can get
you in that baseball camp.

411
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,530
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

412
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,540
Huh?

413
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,540
Ok.

414
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,940
If you need me, just call me
at the base, ok?

415
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,670
Lady Ace, Lady Ace,
come in.

416
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,540
Kim, are you there?

417
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,120
Kim, come in.

418
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,510
Yeah, what?

419
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,040
Listen, we got an
assignment for today.

420
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,550
I don't want any more of
your stupid assignments.

421
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,600
Come on, Kim, I'm
really in trouble.

422
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,650
Good. You got me
in trouble yesterday.

423
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,020
Now what?

424
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
Remember the spies?

425
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,020
You mean the killers?

426
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,420
Uh, yeah. They're
coming to kill me.

427
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,590
They want the Cloak
and Dagger thing back.

428
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,860
I need you to come over.

429
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,930
What Cloak
and Dagger thing?

430
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,650
Can't tell you now.
It's top secret.

431
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,360
Tell him you're having
your breakfast

432
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,950
and you'll call
him back later.

433
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,530
My mom says
I got to go now.

434
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,400
Wait.

435
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,240
I'm having my breakfast.
I'll call you back later.

436
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,540
Is he
always like that?

437
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,040
Usually.

438
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,050
Doesn't it
drive you crazy?

439
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,550
Nah. He's the only boy
in the neighborhood

440
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,020
who isn't boring.

441
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,050
Did I
teach you that?

442
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,210
Well, what's
his father like?

443
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,360
Forget it.
He's not your type.

444
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,390
Wait a minute.

445
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,980
How on earth
would you know

446
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,360
who is or isn't
my type?

447
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,360
He's in the Army
or something.

448
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,930
Oh.

449
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,150
Guess you're right.

450
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,370
We are on our own.

451
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,230
I'll get it.

452
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,450
There's gotta be
something on this tape.

453
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,320
Probably encoded.

454
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,990
So what do we do?

455
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,450
Have it decoded, take it to
the FBI, and we'll be heroes.

456
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,420
How do we do that?

457
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,060
A good spy always knows

458
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,180
when to bring in
outside expertise.

459
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,290
Morris can do it.
He can do anything.

460
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't tell him
too much.

461
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,460
Just enough
to get the job done.

462
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,430
We can trust Morris.

463
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,400
He's my friend.

464
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Friendship is a luxury
a spy can't afford.

465
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,370
What do you mean?

466
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,340
Well, ok, if you
really think so.

467
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,850
Morris.

468
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,730
Thank you.

469
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,420
Morris.

470
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,650
Where's my Twinkies?

471
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,490
Guess what.

472
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,290
What, you made it
to the 17th level

473
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,260
of Cloak and Dagger?

474
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,530
No, Morris,
this is for real.

475
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,560
I got this real important tape
I wanted you to see.

476
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,630
Oh, yeah?

477
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,930
Yeah, it has some secret code
or something in it.

478
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,170
Will you take
a look at it?

479
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,890
Morris, are you
listening to me?

480
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,250
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Davey, I want to

481
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,610
have the Twinkies
or my money back.

482
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,950
What's this?

483
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,280
You tell me.

484
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,820
Looks like a Cloak
and Dagger tape.

485
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,360
Well, it's not.
Take a look at it.

486
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,620
What do you mean,
it's not?

487
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,630
Who gave it to you?

488
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,760
This guy.

489
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,530
I can't tell you
any more than that.

490
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,400
Hmm.

491
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,730
Top secret, huh?

492
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,470
What do you
want me to do?

493
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,600
I don't know, Morris.

494
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,610
You're the genius
around here.

495
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,610
All right.
Let's have a look.

496
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,290
This microchip
doesn't belong here.

497
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,090
What?

498
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,420
Take a look.

499
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,620
Whoever put this in

500
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,730
really knew what
he was doing.

501
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,630
Look at those
connections.

502
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,660
It could be used to
store information.

503
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,530
Input, output...

504
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,600
What kind of information?
Government plans, maybe?

505
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,740
It could be
anything really.

506
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,340
Tell you one thing,
whoever put this in

507
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,940
really went through
a lot of trouble.

508
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,580
Think you can
break the code?

509
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,410
The key is
how to get to it.

510
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,380
I've got an idea.

511
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,290
The guy who gave it to me said
something about some numbers.

512
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,060
What numbers?

513
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,280
1 million...

514
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,050
329...something.

515
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,630
I bet you anything

516
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,330
that's the secret code
that we're looking for.

517
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,500
Can you think
of anything else?

518
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,440
No.

519
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,940
Davey,
are you alone?

520
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,640
That reminds me,
Davey,

521
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,480
I want to get those
walkie-talkies back.

522
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,310
Sure, Morris.

523
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,620
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

524
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm here.

525
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,090
Kim, where are you?

526
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,330
Your house.

527
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,060
Get out of there!

528
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,800
The spies are there!

529
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,440
Kim?

530
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,520
Seems we each
have something

531
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,610
the other wants,
don't we, kid?

532
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,610
Yeah.

533
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,160
We might consider a trade.
How's that sound?

534
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,710
Just leave her alone.
She doesn't know anything.

535
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:24,410
She does now.

536
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,080
Do you know the
Japanese sunken gardens?

537
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,300
Yeah.

538
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,320
Good.

539
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,850
We'll meet you
there at noon.

540
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,190
If you tell anybody
about this,

541
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,530
we'll break your
little friend in half.

542
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,900
Don't give it
to 'em, Davey.

543
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,870
Rule number 2: Never, never
play by the enemy's rules.

544
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,410
I have to give
them something.

545
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,360
I couldn't
take that.

546
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,480
We do it
all the time.

547
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,480
It's called, um...

548
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,620
commandeering necessary
mission equipment.

549
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,540
Stop right there.

550
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,550
Cut the crap, kid.
Give me the tape.

551
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,820
Come any closer and you're
gonna be diving for it.

552
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
Now, are we
gonna make a trade

553
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,740
or are we gonna start
dropping things?

554
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,940
Davey!

555
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,900
Why do you want it
so bad?

556
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,060
It's just a kid's game.

557
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,120
Well, let's just say
I'm a kid at heart.

558
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,990
Why don't you
go buy your own?

559
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,490
They don't cost much.

560
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,200
Look, kid, don't
outsmart yourself.

561
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,930
I got
a couple of friends

562
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,470
and we play, too,
you know.

563
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,100
If I don't hand that
over to them by 5:30,

564
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,740
your little friend there
is gonna die.

565
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,540
All right,
just put it down,

566
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,580
and I'll let her go.

567
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,610
You let Kim go first.

568
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,550
Sure.

569
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,720
Anything you say.

570
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,660
Your turn.

571
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,780
Freeze, turkey!

572
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,150
Take my advice.
Don't follow us.

573
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,250
Otherwise,
I'll have to use this.

574
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,990
Little punk!

575
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,590
Ah!

576
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,590
What?

577
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,730
Boy, am I glad
to see you!

578
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,760
Come on!

579
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,670
It's the wrong one!

580
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,310
Oh, what's going on?

581
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,730
Hurry up!
Let's get out of here!

582
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,030
Thank you.

583
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,070
Thank you.

584
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,210
Thanks, Davey.

585
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,550
What for?

586
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,880
You saved my life.

587
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,220
What were you doing
in my house anyway?

588
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,090
I thought
you weren't coming over.

589
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,650
I wasn't,
but then I felt bad

590
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,220
'cause I hurt
your feelings.

591
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,160
I was just mad

592
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,090
'cause you got me in
trouble yesterday,

593
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,600
and I thought
you were dumb

594
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,180
because of all
that murder stuff.

595
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,770
I never thought
it could be real.

596
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,900
Me, neither.

597
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,770
I'm really sorry,
Davey.

598
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,670
That's ok, Kim.

599
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,940
It's gonna be
all right.

600
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,980
Uh-oh!

601
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,980
I'm gonna get the tape now.

602
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,820
We have no further use for
the kid, do you understand?

603
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,090
Yes,
I understand.

604
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,030
We've got to
get out of here.

605
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,160
I'll make 'em
follow me.

606
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,460
You get to Morris'
as quickly as you can,

607
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,570
and tell him
what's happened.

608
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,230
But they'll kill you
if they catch you.

609
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,150
No, they won't.
I'm the only one

610
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,180
who knows where
the real tape is.

611
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,010
Sir, uh, I got
to get off here.

612
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,910
Sorry, junior. We're not
allowed to stop along here.

613
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,180
But it's an emergency.

614
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,380
It's only 3 blocks to the bus
station and everybody gets off.

615
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,050
But I feel sick...

616
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,880
What?

617
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,290
Yeah, like I'm
gonna throw...Ulp!

618
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,700
Run, Davey! Run!

619
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,680
Why is he
shooting at me?

620
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,050
He must've found out
where the cartridge is.

621
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,480
1 million,

622
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,130
329...

623
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,790
That's it.

624
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,820
I'll be right there!

625
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,760
The following material

626
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,850
is for A-4 security
clearance personnel only.

627
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,930
It is a federal crime
to view such material

628
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,330
without proper
authorization.

629
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,240
Bingo.

630
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,870
I said I'd be
right there.

631
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,420
Looking for
something?

632
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,390
Someone's trying
to kill me.

633
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,190
Well, uh,

634
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,370
why don't you
kill them first?

635
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,470
Don't encourage
him, Henry.

636
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,360
Your food's
getting cold.

637
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,060
Would you
please go away?

638
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,500
Listen, I'm trying
to contact the FBI.

639
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,170
Would you help me?

640
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,940
Get me a direct line
to J. Edgar Hoover.

641
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,460
This is an emergency.

642
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,770
Hoover's dead,
Henry.

643
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:14,580
Oh, my God,
they've gotten Hoover!

644
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,080
Now we're all goners!

645
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,580
Sorry, kid.
Can't help you.

646
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,110
Stand still, Davey.

647
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,690
They wouldn't dare
shoot at you

648
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,630
with all these
people around here.

649
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,580
In fact, the more people,
the better.

650
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,080
Over there.

651
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,260
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

652
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,890
One child?

653
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,360
Uh...yes, ma'am.

654
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,230
That'll be
50 cents.

655
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,600
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

656
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,430
Thanks.

657
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,370
One adult,
2 children.

658
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,180
There he is.

659
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,050
Let's get him.

660
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:31,990
I'll get him.

661
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,190
No, just get
in line. Get in line.

662
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,430
Hey, buddy,
wait your turn.

663
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,850
I'll go get him
out of there.

664
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,600
No, no, just
take it easy now.

665
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,410
Not now.

666
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,450
Tickets, please.

667
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,330
Thank you.

668
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,800
Your ticket, son.

669
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,260
Hey, here you go.

670
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,140
Sorry, sir.

671
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,710
All full. You'll have to
wait for the next boat.

672
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:29,950
We want this one.

673
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm sorry, I can't take
any more passengers.

674
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,980
There'll be another boat
in 10 or 15 minutes.

675
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,000
Howard...Howard,

676
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,710
my wallet's gone!

677
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,210
Are you sure?

678
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,340
Of course I'm sure!

679
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,540
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

680
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,580
We'll go back over every
step we've been over

681
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,250
and see if we can
find it somewhere.

682
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,250
Come on!

683
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,690
Hurry!

684
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,760
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,330
My name is Hal.

686
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,300
Now, our tour through the
Downtown San Antonio River

687
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,300
shall take approximately
25 to 30 minutes.

688
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,100
Now, if you have
any questions

689
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,310
or anything you'd like to
ask me as we go along,

690
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:33,310
please do not hesitate
to do so.

691
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,110
I'm gonna get
close to the boy.

692
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,680
When I give you the signal,
create a diversion.

693
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,480
How?

694
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,450
I don't care how,

695
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:45,350
just as long as people
aren't looking at me.

696
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,000
Sir, would you
kindly have a seat?

697
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,370
You're supposed
to sit down.

698
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,110
Thank you.

699
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,430
Ladies
and gentlemen,

700
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,200
I'd like to call
your attention

701
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,140
to the building coming up
here to the left-hand side

702
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,940
which is the Ahmanson
River Theatre.

703
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,640
Parties and fiestas are held
there almost every day

704
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,910
during the summer months...

705
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,080
George.

706
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,330
What?

707
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,380
Look.

708
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,690
Look at them.

709
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,290
Sit down.

710
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,660
What's wrong, boy?

711
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,500
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you, ma'am.

712
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,400
Try me.

713
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,170
That man over there
is trying to kill me.

714
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,600
Huh?

715
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,670
Sir, uh...

716
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:15,180
please sit down.

717
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,280
Move!

718
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,180
Huh? Why?

719
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,280
Because I said so.
Now move.

720
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,350
Don't be ridiculous.

721
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,060
Looks like a pervert,
if you ask me.

722
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,460
George, we've got to
do something about this.

723
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,490
What?

724
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,230
The building here
to my right-hand side

725
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:36,130
is the old
San Antonio Library

726
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,070
which contains the Huntsberg
Circus Collection,

727
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,340
with 20,000 exhibits depicting
American circus life.

728
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,340
The building that you see
straight ahead

729
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,710
is the Power
and Light Building.

730
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,510
Fire!
Where?

731
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,740
There!
In the engine!

732
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,600
Everybody back
to your seats, please,

733
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,300
and don't panic!

734
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,640
Go back to your seats,
everybody, please.

735
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,670
Thank you.

736
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,710
I'm sorry.

737
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,510
Sir.

738
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,110
Why don't you guys
sit down

739
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,710
and quit
rocking the boat?

740
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,650
Yeah!
Sit down!

741
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,620
It's for
your own safety.

742
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,120
Please sit down.

743
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,590
We'll continue
the tour.

744
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,480
Morris!

745
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,290
Kim!

746
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,060
What happened
to you?

747
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,200
Nothing.
Where's Morris?

748
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,330
I don't know,
but look.

749
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,640
Davey,
do you think they...

750
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,570
No. Morris is
too smart for them.

751
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,640
We'll find him.

752
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,480
I think
he's already dead.

753
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,310
Shut up!
You don't know that!

754
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,620
I'm sorry.

755
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,720
What do we do now?

756
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,620
No use calling my dad.

757
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,160
Why don't you call your mom
and tell her

758
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,500
Rice is going to do something
with the tape at 5:30?

759
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,630
Make her
call the police.

760
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,100
Even if she
doesn't believe you,

761
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,770
we need a grown-up.

762
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,440
Ok. What are you
going to do?

763
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm going to try to
find Rice and stop him.

764
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
How?

765
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,810
I don't know yet.

766
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,720
Well, you going to
stand here all day?

767
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,890
I'm waiting
for the light

768
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,500
to change.
Come on.

769
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,600
They won't hit you if
you just keep moving.

770
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,640
Crazy kid!

771
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,750
He said he had to be
somewhere at 5:30.

772
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,690
Means he'll probably
take his car.

773
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,020
There. "Textronics."

774
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,090
"Rice."

775
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,000
There's no place
to hide in there.

776
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,400
Open the trunk.

777
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,580
Oh.

778
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,820
What's the matter?

779
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,090
Oh. Tough.

780
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,760
It's now or never.
Come on.

781
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,900
In there?

782
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,860
Hurry up.
Hold it down.

783
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,070
Don't close it shut.
Just hold it down.

784
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,570
Oh! Jack?

785
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,540
Agent X, help.

786
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,410
Help me.
Get him off me.

787
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:18,050
Isn't it crowded enough
for you in here?

788
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,250
Oh.

789
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,820
Here.

790
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:23,850
He was my friend.

791
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,520
How could they
do that to him?

792
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,890
I guess he just
wasn't good enough.

793
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,060
Yeah, but they didn't
have to kill him.

794
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,990
When you've been playing
this game as long as I have,

795
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,100
you get used to
this kind of thing.

796
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,540
We've stopped.

797
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,940
Better see where we are.

798
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,540
What happens now?

799
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,610
We just wait
a couple minutes.

800
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,550
I'll walk over there
and make the drop.

801
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,480
So who gets
the game?

802
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,980
I don't know, and I
don't want to know.

803
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,290
We just leave the case,
we wait a few minutes,

804
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,690
take the money.

805
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,190
Only thing I know about
these people is one of them's

806
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,890
missing a couple fingers
from his right hand.

807
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:07,710
Well, remember
the Alamo, boys.

808
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,530
Sure as hell
don't tell you much.

809
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,770
Enough.

810
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:21,080
It's time to go.

811
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,910
Remember, you can win or lose
the game right here.

812
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,530
...taxation
without representation.

813
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,090
In fact,
they were quite angry,

814
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,790
but they did not
want to fight Santa Ana.

815
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:11,010
Instead they
tried to negotiate,

816
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:12,950
content being
citizens of Mexico.

817
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,910
All they wanted
was the reinstatement

818
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,550
of the constitution
and taxes lifted.

819
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,000
In 1835,
negotiations broke down,

820
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,450
and the Texans began
to talk revolution.

821
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,380
General Santa Ana
heard this rumor and...

822
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,310
The souvenir shop is
right through there.

823
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,140
Thank you.

824
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,910
How much time do we have
before that tour bus leaves?

825
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,150
Oh, we've got time.

826
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,350
Let's drop on
by the shop.

827
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,740
Well, look who's here.

828
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,610
Huh?

829
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,080
Last time I saw you,
you were jumping off a boat.

830
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,350
Were you feeling
a little seasick?

831
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,620
I'm hiding from
that man over there.

832
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:14,890
Oh, it's somebody
new this time.

833
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,490
Now, isn't it about time

834
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,160
you told me
what this is all about?

835
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

836
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,700
the Alamo will be
closing in 2 minutes.

837
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,310
Our young friend
seems to be

838
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,910
in some sort
of trouble again.

839
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,910
Now, here,
just a minute.

840
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,010
What is your name?

841
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,480
Davey.

842
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,150
Not Davy Crockett
by any chance?

843
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,560
I really have to
go now.

844
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,130
It's a matter of
national security.

845
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,900
Will everyone please exit
through the front door?

846
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,570
What do you think?

847
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:04,770
I think the boy
needs our help.

848
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,240
Hey, stop that kid!

849
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,010
He's stealing
somebody's bag! Get him!

850
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,710
You got
a hell of a nerve, kid,

851
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,480
stealing inside
the Alamo.

852
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,520
I didn't steal it!

853
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,090
He didn't steal
anything, Officer.

854
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:18,990
He took this.

855
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,660
Well, that's just
a simple mistake.

856
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,890
I sent the boy in to
pick up my camera case,

857
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,030
and he took
the wrong one.

858
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,060
Oh. Hey!

859
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,000
This yours?

860
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,770
Well, come and get it.

861
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,140
Why don't you take
the boy over to the car

862
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,140
while I straighten
this out?

863
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,140
But that one has

864
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,340
a secret
cartridge in it!

865
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,940
Come on.

866
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,150
Don't worry
about it.

867
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:45,950
George will

868
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,950
take care of
everything.

869
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,750
The car's
over here.

870
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,690
Now, don't you
fret yourself.

871
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,920
George will take
care of everything.

872
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,260
He's very good at that.

873
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,900
He's giving him
the camera case!

874
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,840
He is?

875
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,910
Well, if he did, he had
a reason for doing it.

876
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,580
Slide over.

877
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,450
That's it.

878
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,990
This what you're
so worried about?

879
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,890
No, sir.

880
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,010
It was the case
you gave the other man.

881
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,130
That was the one
with the plans in it.

882
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,330
What makes you
so sure

883
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:41,100
I gave the wrong
case back?

884
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:41,740
Pardon?

885
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,770
Why don't you open
it and find out?

886
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:50,310
You got it!

887
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,080
George always makes things
turn out right.

888
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,470
But how'd you do it?

889
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,650
I just gave that man

890
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,530
my camera case
in its place.

891
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,420
He never noticed
the difference.

892
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,790
Now, do you mind
telling us

893
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,960
what this
is all about?

894
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,390
After all, I sacrificed
my good camera

895
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:06,160
to save your
Cloak and Dagger tape.

896
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,830
It isn't just
a Cloak and Dagger tape.

897
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,880
There's an extra
microchip in here.

898
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,930
What was that man
doing with it

899
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,770
at the Alamo?

900
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,110
Said he had to give it
to some foreign spy.

901
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,020
No!

902
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:19,740
Really?

903
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,940
Did he say what
the spy looked like?

904
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,150
Only that he had
2 fingers missing.

905
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,350
How exciting!

906
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:32,990
May I see the tape,
Davey?

907
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,020
Sure.

908
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,960
Something wrong, Davey?

909
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:52,910
It's all right.

910
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,940
Such a clever
little boy.

911
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,780
Don't you think so,
George?

912
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,650
I wish we could take him
to Mexico City with us.

913
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:02,750
I made an arrangement
with Rice.

914
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,550
He's going to take care
of him for us

915
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,820
on our way
to the airport.

916
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,920
I don't like him, and I
don't like his methods,

917
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,460
and I don't like
those 2 thugs of his.

918
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,390
I made it
very clear to him

919
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,330
that we're
very displeased

920
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:15,960
with this whole mess.

921
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,600
He won't dare make
another mistake.

922
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,240
Not if he wants
to do business with us.

923
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,640
I made that
very clear.

924
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,040
What time's
our flight?

925
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,270
Midnight.

926
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,110
We better check out.
I'm afraid we won't be able

927
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,480
to use
our dinner reservations.

928
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,080
What a nuisance.

929
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,760
Wake up.
Somebody's coming.

930
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
Where are we?
I can't see a thing.

931
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,660
Right back where
you put us.

932
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,810
Hey, pop the trunk,
will you?

933
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,960
Better play dead
or you will be.

934
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,860
That kid is
still out cold.

935
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,780
You want to kill him now

936
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,950
or wait till
the chloroform wears off?

937
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,580
Wait till we get
to the desert.

938
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,020
What's taking
Rice so long anyway?

939
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,650
It can't take him 2 hours
to divide up the money.

940
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,420
I think we
should get extra

941
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,420
for killing the kid.

942
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,760
You're right.

943
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,590
Let's go
hurry him up.

944
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,800
We'll never
get out of here.

945
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,940
Stay cool.
I'm thinking.

946
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,080
What are we
going to do?

947
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,990
Open the door.

948
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:52,890
Wait a minute.

949
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,460
What are you doing?

950
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,950
There's
a phone here.

951
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,430
Let's get out of here.

952
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,870
I'm calling Kim.

953
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:03,400
We better get out of here
and find some weapons.

954
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,240
Mom?

955
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,280
No, Kim, it's me.

956
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,530
Have you told
your mom yet?

957
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:10,780
No, she hasn't
come home yet.

958
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,580
She left a note,

959
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,650
but I can't read
her writing.

960
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:13,480
Listen, you got to get
to the airport right away.

961
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,550
The spies
have the tape.

962
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,090
They're kind of old.
A man and lady.

963
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,320
She only has 3 fingers.

964
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,440
Where are you?

965
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,360
I'm in a car.

966
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,360
Listen,
they're catching a plane

967
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,590
to Mexico City
at midnight.

968
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,030
How am I supposed to get
to the airport?

969
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,100
Use your bus pass.

970
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,560
Duck!

971
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,270
I want you boys
to pay attention.

972
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,490
You do what I tell you.

973
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,510
Keep your mouths shut.

974
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:42,040
There's a lot more where
that came from.

975
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,610
What about the girl?
You want us to get her, too?

976
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,310
No. I already
took care of that.

977
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,280
What's that?

978
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,890
Garage door
opener.

979
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,720
What are you going to do,
crush her with a garage door?

980
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:54,960
Not quite.

981
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,870
This is a trigger
for a clock.

982
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,590
It'll set off
enough plastique

983
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,090
to blow up her and
half her neighborhood.

984
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,560
You might have
told us.

985
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,160
We could have been
blown up with her.

986
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,800
That's why
I used a timer.

987
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,470
I told that kid,

988
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,240
"If you cross me,
she's going to die."

989
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,000
So now,
in exactly one hour,

990
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,090
our little friend's
gonna have

991
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:17,180
a very short,
very loud nightmare.

992
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:22,480
That will
be midnight.

993
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,550
Yeah. I got to
call Kim.

994
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:25,250
Go get the van.

995
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,390
Let's get these bodies
out of my trunk.

996
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:29,120
Not now you don't.

997
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,930
Haverman's
got the key.

998
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,760
I'll pop it open
from the glove compartment.

999
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,130
That's all right.
I've got mine.

1000
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,770
He was in there
5 minutes ago.

1001
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,270
Great, Alvarez.

1002
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,940
Haverman,
the kid's gone.

1003
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,110
All right,
let's get out of here.

1004
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,650
What?

1005
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,320
You got to tell me
how to drive this thing.

1006
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,390
I don't know.
This is a real car.

1007
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,630
Ohh!

1008
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,300
Ok. So much for backing up.

1009
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,140
Let's try forward.

1010
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,450
Peel out, Davey.

1011
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,830
Not bad
for a first lesson.

1012
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:55,310
Don't shoot
at my car.

1013
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,210
What are you, crazy?

1014
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,760
Well, that pretty well
covers parking.

1015
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,390
Give me that.
Go get the van.

1016
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,400
Let's go.

1017
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,110
You're doing
just fine, Davey.

1018
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,480
Push the pedal
to the metal!

1019
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,420
Whoa!

1020
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,670
Take a right here,
Davey.

1021
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,210
Ooh!

1022
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,610
Good. Excellent.

1023
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:07,510
Sweeper.

1024
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:10,450
Left, Davey.
The sweeper! The sweeper!

1025
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,720
Road hog!

1026
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,230
Construction!

1027
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,550
Kim's already left.

1028
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,120
She's safe.
Come on, let's go.

1029
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,350
What if they planted
the bomb on her?

1030
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:45,820
How?

1031
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,820
Lady Ace.
Lady Ace, come in.

1032
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,090
Hello, Davey.

1033
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:55,030
Hello.
Can you hear me?

1034
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,570
Why won't she answer?

1035
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,500
She probably dropped
her walkie-talkie.

1036
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,570
Walkie-talkie.

1037
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,840
Cheap thing.

1038
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,210
We got to save Kim!

1039
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:10,610
Right there!
Uh-oh.

1040
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,580
First we got to find
some hardware

1041
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,420
and blast
these guys.

1042
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,380
Come on.

1043
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:17,420
I'm calling Dad.

1044
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,790
That guy thinks
you're a nutcase.

1045
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:19,990
Come on.
Get out of here.

1046
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,360
Come on!

1047
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,900
He's gone.

1048
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,220
No kidding, Alvarez.

1049
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,340
Give me the case.

1050
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,940
All right, you stay
with the van.

1051
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:41,740
We'll go on foot.

1052
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,940
He can't have
gotten very far.

1053
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,610
Come on. Let's go.

1054
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,730
This is starting
to get good.

1055
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:00,530
What?

1056
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,180
Just like
Cloak and Dagger.

1057
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,630
They're trying
to kill us.

1058
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:07,930
They can't kill me.
They can't see me.

1059
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,540
They can kill me.

1060
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,840
Not if you're
good enough.

1061
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,910
That's what this game
is all about, right? Right?

1062
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:14,740
Kelly Field.

1063
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,180
Uh, yes. I'd like
to speak to

1064
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,940
Master Sergeant
Hal Osborne, please.

1065
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,260
It's his son calling.

1066
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,380
Just a minute.

1067
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:22,420
Come on. You're wasting
valuable combat time.

1068
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,850
Yeah, thanks.

1069
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,250
Hello.

1070
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,250
Dad, you got
to help me.

1071
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,850
Davey,
why aren't you in bed?

1072
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,460
The spies,
they planted a bomb

1073
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,260
in Kim's
walkie-talkie,

1074
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,630
and she doesn't
even know it.

1075
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:32,690
Hang up.
Let's go.

1076
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:33,690
I told you
I didn't want you

1077
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:36,430
to get into those games.
You understand that?

1078
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:37,410
Dad,
this is no game.

1079
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,200
Now, I need
your help.

1080
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,470
Davey, look,
I got a rush job here.

1081
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,470
I do not have time...

1082
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,270
Would you listen to me?

1083
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,620
They're trying
to take the plans

1084
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,970
out of the country
at midnight.

1085
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:45,670
Just calm down.

1086
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,710
I don't want you
to get worked up again.

1087
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:49,590
I'll be home just
as soon as I can.

1088
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,480
What did I tell you?
He's useless.

1089
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,480
Dad, I'm not home.

1090
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,660
Now, please, just
listen to me for once.

1091
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,770
I promise you
I'm telling the truth.

1092
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:58,950
Now, you don't have
to worry about me,

1093
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,120
but get to Kim before
the bomb goes off

1094
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:01,960
at midnight.

1095
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,760
What do you mean you're
not home? Where are you?

1096
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,830
I don't know. I'm in
a telephone booth.

1097
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:06,590
Davey,
now listen carefully.

1098
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:08,530
I want you to stay right
right where you are

1099
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,160
and don't get out
of that phone booth.

1100
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,970
Davey?

1101
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,380
What's
with him?

1102
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,950
One down
and two to go.

1103
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,520
Come on.
Get the gun.

1104
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,390
No.

1105
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,720
Davey, come on.
Get with it.

1106
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,720
If you're going
to win this game,

1107
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,220
you got to take advantage
of breaks like this.

1108
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,360
Get the gun.

1109
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,540
We got to get
across town

1110
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,730
and get a bus
to the airport.

1111
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:39,630
Davey!

1112
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,090
Along the river.
It's the fastest way.

1113
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,930
Play right!

1114
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,340
11:35.

1115
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:25,810
I'm not going
to make it in time.

1116
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,580
You're going to have to
take these guys out.

1117
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,980
You know that,
don't you?

1118
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,240
All right, it's time for
the heavy artillery.

1119
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,590
Let me have it.

1120
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:02,940
You got it.

1121
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:02,640
Uhh!

1122
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,870
Now just wait right here
and take them out.

1123
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:09,210
I don't want
to kill anybody.

1124
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,010
You know the rules.

1125
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,710
You're supposed
to take out the obstacles

1126
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:13,850
before reaching
the objective.

1127
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,880
Can't just go right for
the objective. That's no fun.

1128
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,150
Fun?

1129
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,190
We've got 24 minutes

1130
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,560
before the bomb
goes off.

1131
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,820
That's why you have
to take them out.

1132
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,690
Look, how many people

1133
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:28,900
have I killed for you
over the years?

1134
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,480
And now you're saying
you don't want to play?

1135
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,070
Now, come on, this is
Cloak and Dagger for real.

1136
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,070
It's what
you always wanted.

1137
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,870
Yeah, but I don't have
a gun or a knife

1138
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:39,740
or anything.

1139
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,170
The Crossfire Gambit.

1140
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:43,510
Remember
the Crossfire Gambit?

1141
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,760
Now go back down there
and hide.

1142
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,810
Wait till the first guy
passes you.

1143
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,880
Then get Rice's attention
and lead his fire.

1144
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,350
You understand?

1145
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:57,020
Davey, if you don't
save Kim,

1146
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,230
who's going to?

1147
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,760
Ok.

1148
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:07,730
Good luck.

1149
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,920
Hey, Ricey!
What's the matter?

1150
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,420
Can't shoot straight?

1151
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,710
Good work, Davey.

1152
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,400
Now pick up the gun.

1153
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,770
He's dead.

1154
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,970
Never mind that.
You're winning.

1155
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,040
Pick it up.
Come over here.

1156
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,770
My dad was right.

1157
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,670
I don't want to
play anymore.

1158
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:29,110
Davey, don't chicken out
now! Come on!

1159
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:35,010
Hurry up.

1160
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,350
Good boy.

1161
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:43,160
Now hide behind
this tree.

1162
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,060
Wait, Davey!

1163
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:46,960
It's a dead end!

1164
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:38,340
Don't come any closer,
or I'll shoot.

1165
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,280
Sure you will...

1166
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,220
with red ink.

1167
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,550
Only this one
shoots real bullets.

1168
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,690
I'm warning you.

1169
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,060
This is not
a water pistol.

1170
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,130
Neither is this.

1171
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:55,900
I could turn you
into shredded meat

1172
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,970
in about 3 seconds with
this baby if I wanted to.

1173
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:01,300
But you've been
a real pain in the neck,

1174
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,120
so I'm not going
to be that nice.

1175
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,740
You know what
I'm going to do, boy?

1176
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,340
I'm going to blow
both your kneecaps off.

1177
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,850
It won't kill you,

1178
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:15,050
but it'll hurt worse than
any dying you can imagine.

1179
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:18,020
Then you know what
I'm going to do to you, huh?

1180
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,920
Shoot him, Davey.

1181
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:20,590
Shoot him.

1182
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:22,790
I'm going to shoot you
in the stomach.

1183
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:25,960
Then when you beg for me
to finish the job,

1184
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:26,690
I won't do it.

1185
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:30,200
I'm just going
to watch you die...slowly.

1186
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,130
Shoot.

1187
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:33,070
Pull the trigger.

1188
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,340
Please stop. I don't
want to shoot you.

1189
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,710
But I want
to shoot you.

1190
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,870
Kill him.

1191
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:44,080
The guy's a jerk!
Kill him!

1192
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,410
All right, I'll show you
what a real hero would do.

1193
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,480
Watch this.

1194
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,620
Just get him to
shoot over here, ok?

1195
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,220
Agent X will bounce
the bullets

1196
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,290
right back at him.

1197
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,190
Come on.

1198
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:59,390
Come on, turkey, shoot.
Come on.

1199
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,260
Right here. Hit me!

1200
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,460
Jack, don't!

1201
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,630
No!

1202
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:30,960
Jack...

1203
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,300
Good work, Davey.

1204
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,300
You won.

1205
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,130
You're not dead!

1206
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:41,230
No, he never
touched me.

1207
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:45,070
I guess this thing
doesn't stop real bullets.

1208
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:50,210
He could see you.

1209
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:54,510
I doubt if he had
the imagination.

1210
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,470
Anyway, who cares?

1211
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,420
You're a hero.

1212
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:02,890
Hey, Davey.

1213
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:08,090
Look, you killed the bad guys,
you won the game.

1214
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:09,730
How do you feel?

1215
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,160
That wasn't fair.

1216
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,420
You tricked me!
You made me kill him.

1217
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,810
It was a clear case
of self-defense.

1218
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,430
Come on. Let's go
to the airport.

1219
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:21,040
I don't want
to play anymore!

1220
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,180
I see.

1221
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,750
Why do kids
always say that?

1222
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,550
Huh?

1223
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,620
Your father
said the same thing.

1224
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:37,760
After all those games of
Cowboys and Indians...

1225
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,760
you get tired
of make believe,

1226
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,300
you break your toys.

1227
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:48,970
Damn.

1228
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:50,570
He did hit you.

1229
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,770
I'm ok.
Come on. Let's go.

1230
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,270
But you're bleeding.

1231
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:54,770
I'm ok. Come on.

1232
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:57,380
Oh! Oh!

1233
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,180
I'll tell you what,
Davey.

1234
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,780
M-maybe you better go
to the airport without me.

1235
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,490
No, I can't.

1236
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,020
No, no, no. Listen,
you're a hero now, Davey.

1237
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:14,360
You don't need an old
jelly blaster like me anymore.

1238
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,630
Don't say that.
You'll be fine.

1239
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,560
Never did like
that rule...

1240
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,930
leaving when
they stop believing.

1241
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,300
Maybe I better
go get some help.

1242
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,170
No, don't go.

1243
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:29,840
They wouldn't
be able to see me anyway.

1244
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,550
Well...

1245
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:38,550
It was fun while it lasted
anyway, wasn't it, pal?

1246
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,520
But Jack Flack
always escapes.

1247
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,820
Want to
know something?

1248
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,860
You're the best
playmate I ever had.

1249
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,330
You can't
leave, Jack.

1250
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,670
I have to, kid.

1251
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:58,140
You're growing up now.

1252
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,540
Listen...

1253
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,780
Do me a favor,
will you?

1254
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:07,910
Go get me a smoke.

1255
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,720
Over there.

1256
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,830
Jack,
where are you?

1257
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,480
Come back. I can't
do it on my own.

1258
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,240
Yes, you can.

1259
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,450
You were
always on your own.

1260
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:43,720
Save Kim, Davey.

1261
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,430
The white zone
is for the immediate loading

1262
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,830
and unloading
of passengers only.

1263
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,800
There is no parking.

1264
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,880
Hi. I'm David Osborne's
father.

1265
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,890
Oh, yes.
I know.

1266
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,350
Is Kim here?

1267
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,260
Isn't she
at your house?

1268
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,590
No, she's not.

1269
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,580
Look, I just got
a call from David...

1270
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:28,670
Come here. I want to
show you something.

1271
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:30,730
I just got back here.
And look at this.

1272
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:32,800
Is this another one
of your son's games?

1273
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,080
I don't think so.

1274
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,370
I need the phone.

1275
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,390
What is it?

1276
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,210
Operator.

1277
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,670
Operator, let me
have the police.

1278
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,210
This is an emergency.

1279
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,640
My name is
Sergeant Osborne.

1280
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,880
I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Fleming.

1281
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,380
Is it Kim?
Is she...

1282
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,690
Why is he trying
to reach me?

1283
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,560
Two men were shooting
at a young boy.

1284
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,220
I'll have Fleming call...

1285
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,690
Wait a minute!
I'll hold on.

1286
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:02,430
If you can connect me
with the lieutenant,

1287
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:03,360
I'll hold on, ok?

1288
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,700
Two men are dead
down at the river.

1289
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:08,330
They were shooting
at a kid Davey's age.

1290
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:11,970
You and me better get
to that airport.

1291
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:15,540
Sir, which is
the airport bus?

1292
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,540
That one over there.

1293
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,820
Is this the bus
to the airport?

1294
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:25,680
Uh-huh.

1295
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,890
I lost my bus pass.

1296
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:29,360
75 cents.

1297
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,690
I don't have it.

1298
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:31,720
Have to get off,
then.

1299
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,560
Can't let you ride
for free.

1300
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,390
But you have to!

1301
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,730
Listen, I'll pay you
when I get to the airport.

1302
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,860
Sorry.

1303
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:50,440
Flight 146 to Mexico City
is about to board at Gate 15,

1304
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,710
Concourse "B."

1305
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:52,850
Thanks.

1306
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:04,560
Mister,
take me to the airport.

1307
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,730
You got any money, son?

1308
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:07,690
Yeah, lots.

1309
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:09,630
10 bucks in advance.

1310
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,560
I don't
have that much,

1311
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,570
but I have to get...

1312
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,570
Forget it, kid.

1313
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,170
Listen, I don't
have any money,

1314
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,790
but I got to get
to the airport.

1315
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,410
I'll find some way
to pay you

1316
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,610
when we get there.

1317
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:25,880
It's a matter of
life and death.

1318
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,880
What happened
to your leg?

1319
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,650
Nothing.

1320
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:31,520
Look, maybe we better
get you to a hospital.

1321
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,050
That leg doesn't look
too good.

1322
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,450
I don't have time
for that.

1323
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:35,850
If I don't
get to the airport,

1324
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:38,720
a girl is going
to die.

1325
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,390
Get in.

1326
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:43,900
I was going home
that way anyway.

1327
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,700
How long
will it take?

1328
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,870
This time of night
about 10 minutes.

1329
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:54,910
But you have to stop them
from getting on the plane.

1330
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:56,910
You see, they have
the "C" and "D" tape.

1331
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,710
What?

1332
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:59,160
A Cloak
and Dagger tape,

1333
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,410
you know,
a game cartridge.

1334
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,620
Only it has stolen
government plans in it.

1335
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,920
What does this couple
look like?

1336
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,370
I don't know.
Kind of old.

1337
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,150
The woman only
has 2 fingers.

1338
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,720
Maybe it was three.
I forget.

1339
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,820
Will you just stop
that plane from boarding

1340
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:12,460
before they take off
in it?

1341
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:16,860
I think we better
talk to the chief.

1342
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:33,280
11:47.

1343
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,580
Can't we go
any faster?

1344
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:35,910
I only have
a few more minutes.

1345
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:37,880
Yes, sir, boss.

1346
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,430
You mind
hand-searching that?

1347
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:50,600
I don't want to put it
through that electrical doodad.

1348
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:53,900
That's all the
description you've got?

1349
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,900
I told you
we got cut off!

1350
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,740
Look, all you got to do
is check their fingers. Jeez!

1351
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:05,940
Transcon Flight 146
now boarding at Gate 15.

1352
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,250
That's their flight!

1353
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,950
All right, let me just
get this down here.

1354
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:10,880
But there isn't time!

1355
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,520
The white zone is
for immediate loading

1356
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,620
and unloading of
passengers only.

1357
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,420
There is no parking
in the white zone.

1358
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,230
Wait here. I'll find
some way to pay you.

1359
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:23,460
Forget it, kid.

1360
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,930
Thanks.

1361
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:39,880
Southwest Flight 2 arriving
from Houston/Austin...

1362
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,680
How do I
find somebody?

1363
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,850
Tell me their name,
and I'll have them paged.

1364
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,420
Uh, Kim Gardener.

1365
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:50,620
Kim Gardener, please report
to the information counter.

1366
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,890
Kim Gardener to the
information counter.

1367
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,940
Did they call my name?

1368
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,640
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

1369
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,090
What's your mother's
name and phone number?

1370
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:14,550
I think they just said
Kim Gardener. That's me.

1371
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,850
Just a couple
more questions, ok?

1372
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,690
Have you seen
a little girl around 8?

1373
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:22,660
She has blonde hair?

1374
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,860
Is she boarding
on this flight?

1375
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,720
Stop them!

1376
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,780
Just a second,
there, son.

1377
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,630
But they have
the cartridge!

1378
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,960
I'm sorry, son. You'll
just have to go around

1379
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,130
and wait your turn.
Who you with anyway?

1380
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:37,140
Mom, Dad!
Please don't leave me!

1381
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,870
Are they your folks?

1382
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,110
Just a minute, folks.

1383
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,310
Would you mind
coming back here, please?

1384
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:46,710
Uh, the plane's
already boarding.

1385
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,920
It'll wait. Let's get
this straightened out first.

1386
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,820
Transcon Flight 6
from Miami/Atlanta

1387
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:57,860
is now arriving
at gate 17.

1388
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,760
Is this your boy?

1389
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,260
Do we look like we could
have a boy that age?

1390
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,100
You putting
me on, son?

1391
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,870
No, sir. I can prove
they're my folks.

1392
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:11,770
How?

1393
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,670
Look inside
that bag over there.

1394
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,140
You'll find one of
my game cartridges...

1395
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,080
Cloak and Dagger.

1396
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,010
May I see that
bag, please?

1397
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,750
Officer,
this boy is lying.

1398
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:25,920
We've never seen him
before in our lives.

1399
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,940
I still would like
to see that bag.

1400
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,960
Will you give it
to me, please?

1401
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,840
Ok, thank you.

1402
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,530
Kim!
Davey!

1403
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,130
Give me your
walkie-talkie.

1404
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:39,360
He grabbed
the gun!

1405
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,120
Eunice,
grab the kid.

1406
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,690
Please, stay back.

1407
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:46,300
Stay where you are!

1408
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,910
This has
a bom...

1409
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:04,890
Here,
Lieutenant.

1410
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:06,940
Take a look
at this.

1411
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,990
What have
you got?

1412
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,960
Come on.

1413
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,770
We'll begin
boarding passengers

1414
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,970
seated in rows
1 through 15.

1415
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,110
What's
going on here?

1416
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:27,280
Stay back!

1417
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,280
Get over there!

1418
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,620
Oh, my leg!

1419
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:37,820
Davey! Davey!

1420
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:40,830
Out of the way!

1421
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,860
They're wanted by the FBI
for selling military secrets,

1422
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,900
which were smuggled in
children's video cartridges.

1423
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,270
What about my son?

1424
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,740
They've got divers
down there now.

1425
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:58,140
Did this
belong to him?

1426
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,780
God.

1427
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,450
Why didn't
I believe him?

1428
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,640
Lieutenant
Fleming?

1429
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,820
A hijacking
at Gate 15.

1430
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:13,660
Hijacking?

1431
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,740
I want a Code 3.
Code 3.

1432
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:29,270
What happened?

1433
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:30,910
2 people have kidnapped
a little boy...

1434
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,610
Kim!

1435
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:34,110
Mom!

1436
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:37,050
Oh, honey, I was
so worried about you.

1437
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:40,020
They've got
Davey out there.

1438
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:42,820
What did they say?

1439
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,520
If they can't get
a pilot

1440
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,890
to fly 'em to Cuba
within 5 minutes,

1441
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:49,860
they're going
to kill him.

1442
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:50,900
My God.

1443
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,830
What are you going to do?

1444
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,030
FBI is sending over
their resident agent.

1445
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,540
How long
before he gets here?

1446
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:57,900
It'll be a few minutes.
I just talked to them.

1447
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:58,740
A few minutes?

1448
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,910
That may be too late.
My son's on that airplane.

1449
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,840
He says we got
3 minutes.

1450
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,810
He's bluffing.

1451
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:06,210
He's bluffing
with my son's life.

1452
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:06,910
Let me go out there.

1453
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:08,910
I'm a staff sergeant
out at Kelly Field.

1454
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:12,050
I'm licensed
to taxi airplanes.

1455
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,320
Forget it.

1456
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,850
He won't
negotiate.

1457
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:17,060
I think he's
flipping out.

1458
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:18,160
What do I do?

1459
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,260
Tell him a pilot's
coming out there.

1460
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,930
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1461
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:24,760
Listen to me.

1462
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,130
They might even buy
the uniform,

1463
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,900
but what happens
when they expect you

1464
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,940
to take that plane
in the air?

1465
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,910
I'll fake it.

1466
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,340
One more minute, and I blow
this kid's brains out.

1467
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,410
But this
thing has...

1468
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:43,020
Shut up! Shut up!

1469
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,530
George, remember
your blood pressure.

1470
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:48,050
Darn kid's messing
everything up.

1471
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:48,850
Calm down.

1472
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:51,520
As long as we've
got the boy,

1473
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,190
they'll have to
give us a pilot.

1474
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,440
Which one do I pull?

1475
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:11,140
Jack?

1476
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,980
Here comes
someone now.

1477
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,490
Oh.

1478
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,630
Jack, please come back.

1479
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:35,030
I didn't mean
to throw you away.

1480
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,040
I need your help.

1481
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,070
Who are you?

1482
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,540
I'm the pilot.
I'm not armed.

1483
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,740
Turn around.

1484
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,740
Frisk him.

1485
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,240
Where's the boy?

1486
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,910
He's all right.
He's back there.

1487
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,910
He's clean.

1488
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:48,710
Close the door.

1489
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:50,530
Get into
the cockpit.

1490
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,150
No funny
business,

1491
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,990
or I'll blow
your head off.

1492
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:09,870
Watch him,
George.

1493
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,010
Help me, Jack.

1494
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,450
What are you doing?

1495
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:28,920
I have to pressurize
the cabin.

1496
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,390
Switch over there.

1497
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,040
I have to
call the tower

1498
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,380
to get permission
to take off.

1499
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:54,110
Is that all right?

1500
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,650
San Antonio Tower,

1501
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:00,850
this is Flight 146.

1502
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,750
San Antonio Tower,

1503
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,460
this is Flight 146.

1504
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,460
Jack, please
come back.

1505
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,460
I can't do this
on my own.

1506
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,530
I need your help.

1507
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:14,830
Jack...Jack.

1508
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:19,000
Request permission
to taxi to Runway 15

1509
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,140
for reroute to Havana.

1510
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:28,610
Jack, please come back.
I need your help.

1511
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,850
This is captain
Jack Flack.

1512
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,820
David Osborne, to
the cockpit right away.

1513
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,150
What's the big idea?
You don't have to see the kid.

1514
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,790
They told me
to make sure

1515
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,630
the boy was all right
before I take off.

1516
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,960
Come on.

1517
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,830
You're wanted up front.

1518
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:48,470
But the bomb goes off
in less than a minute.

1519
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,140
Come on, junior.

1520
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,970
Now!

1521
01:33:58,980 --> 01:33:59,980
George.

1522
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,110
George!

1523
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:04,550
George! George!

1524
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,290
Davey, get up here
right away!

1525
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:08,790
Dad!

1526
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:09,960
No, you don't!

1527
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,120
Let me go!

1528
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,230
Dad!

1529
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,030
Look, it's moving.

1530
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:21,150
Dad!

1531
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:22,370
Davey!

1532
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,470
George!

1533
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:28,970
Forget the boy
and get back here!

1534
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,110
Well, disarm it.

1535
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,550
I don't know how.

1536
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:45,690
It's still going.
The door!

1537
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:50,760
We got to get you
out of here.

1538
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,800
It won't open with
the cabin pressurized.

1539
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,570
George!

1540
01:34:57,670 --> 01:34:59,470
Open up!

1541
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,210
You'll never fit.

1542
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,610
Never mind me.

1543
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:06,080
Dad, I'm not going
without you!

1544
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,550
Now take my hand.
Hold my hand.

1545
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:19,560
No, Dad! I'm not
leaving without you!

1546
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,080
Let go of my hands!

1547
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,390
No! I'm not leaving!

1548
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:25,560
When you hit the ground,
run away from the plane!

1549
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,100
Dad, come with me!

1550
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:10,780
Dad.

1551
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,080
Dad!

1552
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:31,800
Jack?

1553
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,500
Jack?

1554
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,710
Dad!

1555
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:48,480
Son!

1556
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,580
How'd you escape?

1557
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:55,390
Jack Flack
always escapes.

1558
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:58,190
I don't need
him anymore.

1559
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:00,590
I've got you, Dad.
