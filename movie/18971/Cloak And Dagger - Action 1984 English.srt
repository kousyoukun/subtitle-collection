no credence to it.

00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:29,291
I guess he just
wasn't good enough.

Yeah, but they didn't
have to kill him.

In fact, they were quite angry,

but they did not
want to fight Santa Ana.

857

Instead they tried to negotiate,

We better get out of here
and find some weapons.

01:01:05,474 --> 01:01:07,142
[RING]
Mom?

999
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,176
No, Kim, it's me.

1000
01:01:08,177 --> 01:01:09,310
Have you told your mom yet?

1001
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:10,478
No, she hasn't come home yet.

1002
01:01:10,479 --> 01:01:11,479
She left a note,

1003
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,547
but I can't read her writing.

1004
01:01:12,548 --> 01:01:13,182
Listen, you got to get
to the airport right away.

1005
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:15,450
The spies have the tape.

1006
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:18,787
They're kind of old.
A man and lady.

1007
01:01:18,788 --> 01:01:20,021
She only has 3 fingers.

1008
01:01:20,022 --> 01:01:21,489
Where are you?

1009
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:22,258
I'm in a car.

1010
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,059
Listen, they're catching a plane

1011
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,493
to Mexico City at midnight.

1012
01:01:25,494 --> 01:01:27,729
How am I supposed to get
to the airport?

1013
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,797
Use your bus pass.

1014
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:30,266
Duck!

1015
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,971
I want you boys
to pay attention.

1016
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:37,272
You do what I tell you.

1017
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,406
Keep your mouths shut.

1018
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:41,943
There's a lot more where
that came from.

1019
01:01:41,944 --> 01:01:44,312
What about the girl?
You want us to get her, too?

1020
01:01:44,313 --> 01:01:47,015
No. I already
took care of that.

1021
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:49,184
What's that?

1022
01:01:49,185 --> 01:01:50,786
Garage door opener.

1023
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:53,421
What are you going to do,
crush her with a garage door?

1024
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:54,856
Not quite.

1025
01:01:54,857 --> 01:01:56,925
This is a trigger for a clock.

1026
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,493
It'll set off enough plastique

1027
01:01:58,494 --> 01:01:59,795
to blow up her and
half her neighbourhood.

1028
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:01,462
You might have told us.

1029
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:02,864
We could have been
blown up with her.

1030
01:02:02,865 --> 01:02:05,500
That's why I used a timer.

1031
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:06,368
I told that kid,

1032
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:08,937
If you cross me,
she's going to die.

1033
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,505
So now, in exactly one hour,

1034
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:12,473
our little friend's gonna have

1035
01:02:12,474 --> 01:02:16,879
a very short,
very loud nightmare.

1036
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:21,549
That will be midnight.

1037
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:24,252
Yeah. I got to
call Kim.

1038
01:02:24,253 --> 01:02:25,154
Go get the van.

1039
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:27,088
Let's get these bodies
out of my trunk.

1040
01:02:27,089 --> 01:02:28,825
Not now you don't.

1041
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:31,827
Haverman's got the key.

1042
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:34,462
I'll pop it open
from the glove compartment.

1043
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,833
That's all right.
I've got mine.

1044
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:43,471
He was in there 5 minutes ago.

1045
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,173
Great, Alvarez.

1046
01:02:45,174 --> 01:02:47,843
Haverman, the kid's gone.

1047
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:50,813
All right,
let's get out of here.

1048
01:02:52,581 --> 01:02:54,350
What?

1049
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:02,023
You got to tell me
how to drive this thing.

1050
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:05,094
I don't know.
This is a real car.

Ohh!

OK. So much for backing up.

Peel out, Davey.

Not bad for a first lesson.

Don't shoot at my car.

covers parking.

Give me that.
Go get the van.

1061

01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:40,795
Along the river.
It's the fastest way.

1160
01:08:40,796 --> 01:08:42,631
Play right!

1161
01:09:22,538 --> 01:09:24,239
11:35.

1162
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,706
I'm not going
to make it in time.

1163
01:09:25,707 --> 01:09:28,276
You're going to have to
take these guys out.

1164
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:30,679
You know that, don't you?

1165
01:09:58,374 --> 01:09:59,940
All right, it's time for
the heavy artillery.

1166
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:00,941
Let me have it.

1167
01:10:00,942 --> 01:10:02,644
You got it.

1168
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,538
Uhh!

1169
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:05,573
Now just wait right here
and take them out.

1170
01:11:05,574 --> 01:11:08,909
I don't want to kill anybody.

1171
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:10,911
You know the rules.

1172
01:11:10,912 --> 01:11:12,413
You're supposed
to take out the obstacles

1173
01:11:12,414 --> 01:11:13,748
before reaching the objective.

1174
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:16,584
Can't just go right for
the objective. That's no fun.

1175
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:18,052
Fun?

1176
01:11:18,053 --> 01:11:20,087
We've got 24 minutes

1177
01:11:20,088 --> 01:11:22,457
before the bomb goes off.

1178
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,526
That's why you have
to take them out.

1179
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:27,595
Look, how many people

1180
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:28,796
have I killed for you
over the years?

1181
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:31,699
And now you're saying
you don't want to play?

1182
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,768
Now, come on, this is
Cloak and Dagger for real.

1183
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:35,970
It's what you always wanted.

1184
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:38,573
Yeah, but I don't have
a gun or a knife

1185
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:39,640
or anything.

1186
01:11:39,641 --> 01:11:41,075
The Crossfire Gambit.

1187
01:11:41,076 --> 01:11:43,678
Remember the Crossfire Gambit?

1188
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,546
Now go back down there and hide.

1189
01:11:45,547 --> 01:11:47,715
Wait till the first guy
passes you.

1190
01:11:47,716 --> 01:11:50,585
Then get Rice's attention
and lead his fire.

1191
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,053
You understand?

1192
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:56,724
Davey, if you don't save Kim,

1193
01:11:56,725 --> 01:11:58,927
who's going to?

1194
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:04,466
OK.

1195
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,436
Good luck.

1196
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:03,618
Hey, Ricey!
What's the matter?

1197
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:06,121
Can't shoot straight?

1198
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,830
Good work, Davey.

1199
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,097
Now pick up the gun.

1200
01:14:17,098 --> 01:14:18,666
He's dead.

1201
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,668
Never mind that.
You're winning.

1202
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,737
Pick it up.
Come over here.

1203
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:24,672
My dad was right.

1204
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:26,574
I don't want to play anymore.

1205
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:28,810
Davey, don't chicken out
now! Come on!

1206
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:34,716
Hurry up.

1207
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:39,253
Good boy.

1208
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:42,857
Now hide behind this tree.

1209
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:43,991
Wait, Davey!

1210
01:14:43,992 --> 01:14:46,662
It's a dead end!

1211
01:15:35,677 --> 01:15:38,045
Don't come any closer,
or I'll shoot.

1212
01:15:38,046 --> 01:15:39,947
Sure you will...

1213
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:41,917
with red ink.

1214
01:15:42,984 --> 01:15:46,254
Only this one
shoots real bullets.

1215
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:49,590
I'm warning you.

1216
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:51,759
This is not a water pistol.

1217
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,027
Neither is this.

1218
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:55,796
I could turn you
into shredded meat

1219
01:15:55,797 --> 01:15:58,666
in about 3 seconds with
this baby if I wanted to.

1220
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:01,001
But you've been
a real pain in the neck,

1221
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:02,870
so I'm not going
to be that nice.

1222
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,641
You know what
I'm going to do, boy?

1223
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:09,043
I'm going to blow
both your kneecaps off.

1224
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:11,746
It won't kill you,

1225
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:14,749
but it'll hurt worse than
any dying you can imagine.

1226
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,718
Then you know what
I'm going to do to you, huh?

1227
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:19,620
Shoot him, Davey.

1228
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:20,488
Shoot him.

1229
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:22,690
I'm going to shoot you
in the stomach.

1230
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:25,660
Then when you beg for me
to finish the job,

1231
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:26,594
I won't do it.

1232
01:16:26,595 --> 01:16:29,897
I'm just going
to watch you die... slowly.

1233
01:16:29,898 --> 01:16:31,031
Shoot.

1234
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:32,768
Pull the trigger.

1235
01:16:34,002 --> 01:16:37,037
Please stop. I don't
want to shoot you.

1236
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:39,406
But I want to shoot you.

1237
01:16:39,407 --> 01:16:40,775
Kill him.

1238
01:16:40,776 --> 01:16:43,779
The guy's a jerk!
Kill him!

1239
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,115
All right, I'll show you
what a real hero would do.

1240
01:16:48,116 --> 01:16:50,384
Watch this.

1241
01:16:50,385 --> 01:16:53,320
Just get him to
shoot over here, OK?

1242
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,922
Agent X will bounce the bullets

1243
01:16:54,923 --> 01:16:55,990
right back at him.

1244
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:57,091
Come on.

1245
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,093
Come on, turkey, shoot.
Come on.

1246
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:00,961
Right here. Hit me!

1247
01:17:00,962 --> 01:17:03,164
Jack, don't!

1248
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:08,336
No!

1249
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,658
Jack...

1250
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:35,996
Good work, Davey.

1251
01:17:35,997 --> 01:17:37,197
You won.

1252
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:39,033
You're not dead!

1253
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:41,135
No, he never touched me.

1254
01:17:41,136 --> 01:17:44,773
I guess this thing
doesn't stop real bullets.

1255
01:17:47,475 --> 01:17:50,110
He could see you.

1256
01:17:50,111 --> 01:17:54,214
I doubt if he had
the imagination.

1257
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,816
Anyway, who cares?

1258
01:17:55,817 --> 01:17:58,119
You're a hero.

you won the game.

That wasn't fair.

1263
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,400
You tricked me!
You made me kill him.

1264
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:15,369
It was a clear case
of self-defence.

1265
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:17,905
Come on. Let's go
to the airport.

1266

I'm OK.
Come on. Let's go.

I'll tell you what, Davey.

1281

M-maybe you better go
to the airport without me.

1282

No, I can't.

No, don't go.

1321
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,464
I just got back here.
And look at this.

1322
01:21:30,465 --> 01:21:32,499
Is this another one
of your son's games?

1323
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,601
I don't think so.

1324
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:37,071
I need the phone.

1325
01:21:37,072 --> 01:21:38,072
What is it?

1326
01:21:38,073 --> 01:21:39,106
Operator.

1327
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,375
Operator, let me
have the police.

1328
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,110
This is an emergency.

1329
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,544
My name is Sergeant Osborne.

1330
01:21:44,545 --> 01:21:47,581
I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Fleming.

1331
01:21:47,582 --> 01:21:50,284
Is it Kim?
Is she...

1332
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,586
Why is he trying to reach me?

1333
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:56,256
Two men were shooting
at a young boy.

1334
01:21:56,257 --> 01:21:58,292
I'll have Fleming call...

1335
01:21:58,293 --> 01:21:59,593
Wait a minute!
I'll hold on.

1336
01:21:59,594 --> 01:22:02,129
If you can connect me
with the lieutenant,

1337
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:03,263
I'll hold on, OK?

1338
01:22:03,264 --> 01:22:04,598
Two men are dead
down at the river.

1339
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:07,567
They were shooting
at a kid Davey's age.

1340
01:22:07,568 --> 01:22:11,672
You and me better get
to that airport.

1341
01:22:13,574 --> 01:22:15,242
Sir, which is the airport bus?

1342
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:17,245
That one over there.

1343
01:22:23,284 --> 01:22:24,518
Is this the bus to the airport?

1344
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:25,585
Uh-huh.

1345
01:22:25,586 --> 01:22:27,587
I lost my bus pass.

1346
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:29,256
75 cents.

1347
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:30,590
I don't have it.

1348
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:31,625
Have to get off, then.

1349
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:33,260
Can't let you ride for free.

1350
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:35,295
But you have to!

1351
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,431
Listen, I'll pay you
when I get to the airport.

1352
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:38,566
Sorry.

1353
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:50,144
Flight 146 to Mexico City
is about to board at Gate 15,

1354
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:51,411
Concourse B.

1355
01:22:51,412 --> 01:22:52,547
Thanks.

1356
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:04,258
Mister, take me to the airport.

1357
01:23:04,259 --> 01:23:06,426
You got any money, son?

1358
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:07,594
Yeah, lots.

1359
01:23:07,595 --> 01:23:09,596
10 bucks in advance.

1360
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:11,265
I don't have that much,

1361
01:23:11,266 --> 01:23:12,266
but I have to get...

1362
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:14,269
Forget it, kid.

1363
01:23:18,139 --> 01:23:20,407
Listen, I don't have any money,

1364
01:23:20,408 --> 01:23:21,808
but I got to get to the airport.

1365
01:23:21,809 --> 01:23:23,110
I'll find some way to pay you

1366
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:24,511
when we get there.

1367
01:23:24,512 --> 01:23:25,579
It's a matter of life and death.

1368
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,581
What happened to your leg?

1369
01:23:27,582 --> 01:23:28,549
Nothing.

1370
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:31,218
Look, maybe we better
get you to a hospital.

1371
01:23:31,219 --> 01:23:32,586
That leg doesn't look too good.

1372
01:23:32,587 --> 01:23:34,288
I don't have time for that.

1373
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:35,555
If I don't get to the airport,

1374
01:23:35,556 --> 01:23:38,425
a girl is going to die.

1375
01:23:38,426 --> 01:23:40,294
Get in.

1376
01:23:40,295 --> 01:23:43,597
I was going home
that way anyway.

1377
01:23:43,598 --> 01:23:45,599
How long will it take?

1378
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,568
This time of night
about 10 minutes.

1379
01:23:50,571 --> 01:23:54,608
But you have to stop them
from getting on the plane.

1380
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:56,610
You see, they have
the C and D tape.

1381
01:23:56,611 --> 01:23:57,611
What?

1382
01:23:57,612 --> 01:23:58,812
A Cloak and Dagger tape,

1383
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,314
you know, a game cartridge.

1384
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:02,316
Only it has stolen
government plans in it.

1385
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:04,618
What does this couple look like?

1386
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:06,320
I don't know.
Kind of old.

1387
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:07,521
The woman only has 2 fingers.

1388
01:24:07,522 --> 01:24:09,623
Maybe it was three.
I forget.

1389
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:11,525
Will you just stop
that plane from boarding

1390
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:12,360
before they take off in it?

1391
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:16,564
I think we better
talk to the chief.

1392
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:33,180
11:47.

1393
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,481
Can't we go any faster?

1394
01:24:34,482 --> 01:24:35,615
I only have a few more minutes.

1395
01:24:35,616 --> 01:24:37,585
Yes, sir, boss.

1396
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,327
You mind hand-searching that?

1397
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:50,298
I don't want to put it
through that electrical doodad.

1398
01:24:51,499 --> 01:24:53,600
That's all the
description you've got?

1399
01:24:53,601 --> 01:24:55,802
I told you we got cut off!

1400
01:24:55,803 --> 01:24:59,439
Look, all you got to do
is check their fingers. Jeez!

1401
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:05,645
Transcon Flight 146
now boarding at Gate 15.

1402
01:25:05,646 --> 01:25:07,147
That's their flight!

1403
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,649
All right, let me just
get this down here.

1404
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:10,784
But there isn't time!

1405
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:14,221
The white zone is
for immediate loading

1406
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:16,523
and unloading of
passengers only.

1407
01:25:16,524 --> 01:25:19,559
There is no parking
in the white zone.

1408
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,928
Wait here. I'll find
some way to pay you.

1409
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:23,163
Forget it, kid.

1410
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:24,632
Thanks.

1411
01:25:35,376 --> 01:25:39,579
Southwest Flight 2 arriving
from Houston/Austin...

1412
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,581
How do I find somebody?

1413
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:43,550
Tell me their name,
and I'll have them paged.

1414
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:46,320
Uh, Kim Gardener.

1415
01:25:46,321 --> 01:25:50,324
Kim Gardener, please report
to the information counter.

1416
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:53,594
Kim Gardener to the
information counter.

1417
01:26:02,837 --> 01:26:05,872
[beeping]

1418
01:26:05,873 --> 01:26:07,841
Did they call my name?

1419
01:26:07,842 --> 01:26:09,543
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

1420
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:11,545
What's your mother's
name and phone number?

1421
01:26:11,546 --> 01:26:14,248
I think they just said
Kim Gardener. That's me.

1422
01:26:14,249 --> 01:26:16,551
Just a couple
more questions, OK?

1423
01:26:17,818 --> 01:26:21,388
Have you seen
a little girl around 8?

1424
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:22,556
She has blonde hair?

1425
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:23,557
Is she boarding on this flight?

1426
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:25,625
Stop them!

1427
01:26:25,626 --> 01:26:27,894
Just a second, there, son.

1428
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:29,529
But they have the cartridge!

1429
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,665
I'm sorry, son. You'll
just have to go around

1430
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,833
and wait your turn.
Who you with anyway?

1431
01:26:33,834 --> 01:26:36,836
Mom, Dad!
Please don't leave me!

1432
01:26:36,837 --> 01:26:38,573
Are they your folks?

1433
01:26:40,007 --> 01:26:42,008
Just a minute, folks.

1434
01:26:42,009 --> 01:26:44,010
Would you mind
coming back here, please?

1435
01:26:44,011 --> 01:26:46,613
Uh, the plane's
already boarding.

1436
01:26:46,614 --> 01:26:49,616
It'll wait. Let's get
this straightened out first.

1437
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:53,520
Transcon Flight 6
from Miami/Atlanta

1438
01:26:53,521 --> 01:26:57,558
is now arriving at gate 17.

1439
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:00,660
Is this your boy?

1440
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:04,965
Do we look like we could
have a boy that age?

1441
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,001
You putting me on, son?

1442
01:27:08,002 --> 01:27:09,569
No, sir. I can prove
they're my folks.

1443
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:11,671
How?

1444
01:27:11,672 --> 01:27:14,574
Look inside that bag over there.

1445
01:27:14,575 --> 01:27:16,843
You'll find one of
my game cartridges...

1446
01:27:16,844 --> 01:27:18,978
Cloak and Dagger.

1447
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:20,580
May I see that bag, please?

1448
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:22,649
Officer, this boy is lying.

1449
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:25,619
We've never seen him
before in our lives.

1450
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,921
I still would like
to see that bag.

1451
01:27:27,922 --> 01:27:29,656
Will you give it to me, please?

1452
01:27:29,657 --> 01:27:31,525
OK, thank you.

1453
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:33,427
Kim!
Davey!

1454
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:34,829
Give me your walkie-talkie.

1455
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:39,333
He grabbed the gun!

1456
01:27:39,334 --> 01:27:41,000
Eunice, grab the kid.

1457
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:42,569
Please, stay back.

1458
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:45,972
Stay where you are!

1459
01:27:45,973 --> 01:27:48,609
This has a born...

1460
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,358
Here, Lieutenant.

1461
01:28:04,359 --> 01:28:06,693
Take a look at this.

1462
01:28:06,694 --> 01:28:08,695
What have you got?

1463
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:10,665
Come on.

1464
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:18,405
We'll begin boarding passengers

1465
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:20,674
seated in rows 1 through 15.

1466
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:22,810
What's going on here?

1467
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:26,981
Stay back!

1468
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:29,984
Get over there!

1469
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:33,820
Oh, my leg!

1470
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:36,856
Davey! Davey!

1471
01:28:36,857 --> 01:28:40,727
Out of the way!

1472
01:28:40,728 --> 01:28:43,630
They're wanted by the FBI
for selling military secrets,

1473
01:28:43,631 --> 01:28:46,600
which were smuggled in
children's video cartridges.

1474
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:48,969
What about my son?

1475
01:28:50,004 --> 01:28:53,441
They've got divers
down there now.

1476
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:57,845
Did this belong to him?

1477
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:04,684
God.

1478
01:29:04,685 --> 01:29:07,153
Why didn't I believe him?

1479
01:29:07,154 --> 01:29:08,855
Lieutenant Fleming?

1480
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:11,525
A hijacking at Gate 15.

1481
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:13,360

[BEEPING]

I want a Code 3.
Code 3.

1484
01:29:27,675 --> 01:29:29,175
What happened?

1485
01:29:29,176 --> 01:29:30,610
2 people have kidnapped
a little boy...

1486
01:29:30,611 --> 01:29:31,611
Kim!

1487
01:29:31,612 --> 01:29:34,013
Mom!

1488
01:29:34,014 --> 01:29:36,750
Oh, honey, I was
so worried about you.

1489
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,720
They've got Davey out there.

1490
01:29:40,721 --> 01:29:42,722
What did they say?

1491
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:45,425
If they can't get a pilot

1492
01:29:45,426 --> 01:29:47,594
to fly 'em to Cuba
within 5 minutes,

1493
01:29:47,595 --> 01:29:49,563
they're going to kill him.

1494
01:29:49,564 --> 01:29:50,797
My God.

1495
01:29:50,798 --> 01:29:52,732
What are you going to do?

1496
01:29:52,733 --> 01:29:54,734
FBI is sending over
their resident agent.

1497
01:29:54,735 --> 01:29:56,436
How long before he gets here?

1498
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:57,604
It'll be a few minutes.
I just talked to them.

1499
01:29:57,605 --> 01:29:58,638
A few minutes?

1500
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,607
That may be too late.
My son's on that airplane.

1501
01:30:00,608 --> 01:30:02,542
He says we got 3 minutes.

1502
01:30:02,543 --> 01:30:03,710
He's bluffing.

1503
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:05,912
He's bluffing
with my son's life.

1504
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:06,814
Let me go out there.

1505
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:08,615
I'm a staff sergeant
out at Kelly Field.

1506
01:30:08,616 --> 01:30:11,751
I'm licensed to taxi airplanes.

1507

Forget it.

1508
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:14,754
He won't negotiate.

1509
01:30:14,755 --> 01:30:16,756
I think he's flipping out.

1510
01:30:16,757 --> 01:30:17,858
What do I do?

1511
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,961
Tell him a pilot's
coming out there.

1512
01:30:21,962 --> 01:30:23,630
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1513
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:24,664
Listen to me.

1514
01:30:24,665 --> 01:30:27,033
They might even buy the uniform,

1515
01:30:27,034 --> 01:30:28,602
but what happens
when they expect you

1516
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:31,638
to take that plane in the air?

1517
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:33,608
I'll fake it.

1518
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:39,045
One more minute, and I blow
this kid's brains out.

1519

But this thing has...

Shut up! Shut up!

George, remember
your blood pressure.

Darn kid's messing
everything up.

1523
01:30:47,755 --> 01:30:48,755
Calm down.

1524
01:30:48,756 --> 01:30:51,691
As long as we've got the boy,

1525
01:30:51,692 --> 01:30:53,894
they'll have to give us a pilot.

1526
01:31:03,804 --> 01:31:06,140
Which one do I pull?

Who are you?

1535
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:39,238
I'm the pilot.
I'm not armed.

1536
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:40,940
Turn around.

1537

Frisk him.
