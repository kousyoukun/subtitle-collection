1
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,646
是我。
C'est moi.

2
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,401
我还以为你不会出现了。
I thought you'd never show up.

3
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,821
我们正赶时间。
We're crowding call time.

4
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:20,033
钢琴弹起来。这会很短。我会把它编成密码。
Get the piano going. This will be a short one. I'll put it in code.

5
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,274
什么耸人听闻的吗?
Anything sensational?

6
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,028
不。有些沥青铀矿。四十车。
No. Some are pitchblende. Forty carloads.

7
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,323
——向北?-是的。为德国。
- Heading north? - Yeah. For Germany.

8
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,389
高杯酒。他甚至都没来得及签字。
Highball. He didn't even get the chance to sign off.

9
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,979
从捷克斯洛伐克沥青铀矿。从西班牙沥青铀矿。
Pitchblende from czechoslovakia. Pitchblende from Spain.

10
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,232
在过去的30天里从德国运出了250辆车。
Two hundred and fifty carloads out of Germany in the past 30 days.

11
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,319
英国情报机构表示，他们已经从挪威拿走了全部的独居石。
And British intelligence says they've taken the whole output of monazite from Norway.

12
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,073
我们的问题是我们没有足够的人来分析科学数据。
Our trouble is we haven't enough people who can analyse scientific data.

13
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,660
沥青铀矿和独居石。
Pitchblende and monazite.

14
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,708
我明天才回来。我得找个能分析的人谈谈。
I'll be out of town till tomorrow. I've got to talk to somebody who can analyse it.

15
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,948
谁在那?
Who's there?

16
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,492
一个兄弟会的老兄弟。
An old fraternity brother.

17
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,588
克莱门! 你好吗?
Why, clem! How are you?

18
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,760
不知道我现在怎么样。我在地窖里转来转去破门而入就为了找到你。
Don't know how I am. I've been wandering through cellars... And breaking down doors trying to get to you.

19
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,762
-你有事瞒着我吗?——没有。
- Are you hiding something from me? - No.

20
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,598
但你在瞒我什么?我以为你参军了。
But what are you hiding from me? I thought you were in the army.

21
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,975
为了让你明白，我是个上校。
To put you in your place, I'm a colonel.

22
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,645
-那为什么穿便服?-我在0.8.8。
- Then why the civilian clothes? - I'm in 0.8.8.

23
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,231
-没听说过。——这很好。我们不应该引起公众的注意。
- Never heard of it. - That's fine. We're not supposed to get publicity.

24
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,192
是战略服务办公室。
It's the office of strategic services.

25
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,737
在华盛顿，我们被称为秘密特工。
Around Washington we're called the cloak-and-dagger boys.

26
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,490
——听起来浪漫。——确定。非常。
- Sounds romantic. - Sure. Very.

27
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,577
我们有很多事要做，阿尔瓦。情报工作。士气的东西。
We do a lot of things, alvah. Intelligence work. Morale stuff.

28
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,579
敌后作战。
Operations behind the enemy lines.

29
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,248
既然这么保密，你为什么要告诉我这些?
Why are you telling me all this if it's so hush-hush?

30
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,670
最近的核物理研究进展如何?
How's work in nuclear physics these days?

31
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,300
——一般。-别靠近我。
- So-so. - Don't close up on me.

32
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,470
这也是秘密，克莱姆，政府的工作。
Well, it's hush-hush too, clem- government work.

33
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,181
我知道。你在做曼哈顿项目。
I know. You're working on the Manhattan project.

34
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,311
我就是为此而来的。
That's why I'm here.

35
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,863
这对你意味着什么?
What does this mean to you?

36
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,452
沥青铀矿铀。独居石的钍。
Pitchblende's for uranium. Monazite's for thorium.

37
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:20,542
我们不再使用钍了。235有更方便的原子结构。
We're not working with thorium anymore. 235 has a more convenient atomic structure.

38
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,712
德国人有没有可能知道一些我们不知道的关于钍的事?
Any chance the Germans have learned something about thorium we don't know?

39
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,005
德国人吗?
The Germans?

40
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,762
我可不这么认为。但这样的数量不是实验室能做的。
I wouldn't think so. But... quantities like these aren't for the laboratory.

41
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,306
它们是用于大规模行动的。
They're for large-scale operations.

42
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,226
你觉得他们可能也在研究原子弹吗?
Do you think they might be working on an atomic bomb too?

43
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,274
我们都想知道。他们有头脑。
We've all wondered. They got the brains.

44
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,027
他们对核裂变的了解和我们一样多。
They know as much about nuclear fission as we do.

45
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,699
阿尔瓦，他们在研究原子弹。
Well, alvah, they are working on an atom bomb.

46
00:08:55,702 --> 00:09:05,545
嗯哼。克莱姆，这是我第一次后悔自己是科学家。
Mm-hmm. Clem, this is the first time I was ever sorry I'm a scientist.

47
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,922
为什么?
Why?

48
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:17,682
听着，再过几年，我们就能分解这个苹果的原子结构。
Look, in a few years, we'll be able to break up the atomic structure of this apple.

49
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,105
当我们这样做的时候，它将成为一个炸弹。
When we do that, it will become a bomb.

50
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:38,828
这个小苹果的能量可以摧毁这所大学，整个城市，它的医院，图书馆，它的优秀的医学院，更不用说里面所有的人了。
The energy in this one, little apple could pulverise this university, this whole town, its fine hospitals, its libraries, its wonderful medical schools, to say nothing of all the people in it.

51
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,377
但是…我们还是做不出一个，小苹果。
But... We still wouldn't be able to make one, little apple.

52
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:53,301
我们有点超前了。社会还没有为原子能做好准备。
We're running ahead of ourselves. Society isn't ready for atomic energy.

53
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
我吓坏了。
I'm scared stiff.

54
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:03,311
这是第一次，成千上万的科学家联合在一起，共同研究什么?
For the first time, thousands of allied scientists are working together to make what?

55
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:09,067
一个炸弹!但是，战前谁愿意资助消灭肺结核的科学研究呢?
A bomb! But who was willing to finance science before the war to wipe out tuberculosis?

56
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,196
我们什么时候能拿到十亿美元去消灭癌症?
And when are we gonna be given a billion dollars to wipe out cancer?

57
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,782
我告诉你，我们可以在一年内完成。
I tell you, we could do it in one year.

58
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:33,800
但如果有人要研制原子弹，你希望是我们，而不是纳粹。
But if anybody's going to develop the atom bomb, you want it to be us, not the Nazis.

59
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,052
没有多少选择。
Not much choice in that.

60
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,014
阿尔瓦，我们需要更多训练有素的人。
Alvah, we need more trained men on this.

61
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,642
我们得知道德国人走了多远。
We've got to know how far the Germans have gone.

62
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,436
他们工作的地方。我们如何阻止他们。
Where they're working. How we can stop them.

63
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,438
我们大部分的探员都没有装备。
Most of our agents aren't equipped.

64
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,440
他们不知道要找什么。
They don't know what to look for.

65
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,987
他们遗漏了一些线索，我知道。这是一场比赛。
They're missing clues, I know. This is a race.

66
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,489
不是德国人就是我们。
It's the Germans or us.

67
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,410
我们得让更多的科学家加入我们的队伍。
We've got to get more scientists into our outfit.

68
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,495
那我在这里做什么呢?
How about what I'm doing here?

69
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,416
我已经被授权让你离开了。你知道问题所在。
I'm already authorised to take you off. You know the problem.

70
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,128
你是单身。你会说一点德语。但你必须成为志愿者。
You're single. You can speak a little German. But you've got to volunteer.

71
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,677
曾经有一段时间，我想成为某种秘密特工。
There was a time when I thought I'd like to become some sort of a secret agent.

72
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,054
我八岁的时候就放弃了。
I gave it up at the age of eight.

73
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,728
好吧，兄弟，你现在是间谍了。
Okay, brother, you're now a spy.

74
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,941
我有两张回华盛顿的机票。
I've got two plane tickets back to Washington.

75
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,402
我能有时间结束这一切吗?
Can I even have time to wind things up here?

76
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,448
通常我们会给你几周的时间，但我想让你看看这个。
Ordinarily we'd give you a few weeks, but I want you to take a look at this.

77
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,914
认识她吗?
Know her?

78
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,667
卡特琳·洛多医生，最伟大的医生之一。
Dr. Katerin lodor, one of the great ones.

79
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:54,714
在匈牙利被卖给纳粹之前我是我的科学模特。
Used to be my scientific pinup girl before Hungary sold out to the Nazis.

80
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,718
我猜她现在正处于德国原子研究的中心。
I suppose now she's right in the centre of German atomic work.

81
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,638
-她在瑞士。从什么时候开始?
- She's in Switzerland. - Since when?

82
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,226
大约六个星期。她一个人翻越了阿尔卑斯山。
About six weeks. She came over the alps... alone.

83
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,312
她因肺炎住进了苏黎世的一家医院。
She's been in a hospital in Zurich with pneumonia.

84
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,023
几天前她和美国领事馆取得了联系。
A few days ago she got in touch with the American consulate.

85
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,609
她说要见我们的一位科学家。
Said she wanted to see one of our scientists.

86
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,074
你不知道这让我有多开心。
You don't know how happy that makes me feel.

87
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:29,123
如果她刚离开德国，她会知道这是一个极好的机会!
If she's just out of Germany she can tell... this is a terrific break!

88
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:35,880
如果你不再为此感到高兴，回家收拾行李，过几天你就能见到她了。——好的。
If you'd stop feeling so happy about it and go home and pack a bag, - you can see her in a couple of days. - Okay.

89
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,661
我希望您对您的房间满意。
I hope you find your room satisfactory.

90
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,248
谢谢schoen表示。
Danke schoen.

91
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,238
-非常抱歉，先生-很好
- Very sorry, sir. - Quite all right.

92
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,178
-给你。,非常感谢。
- Here you go. - Danke sehr.

93
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,548
不要回头。
Don't turn around.

94
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,472
你要见的女士在安吉洛医院。
The lady you want to see is at the Angelo hospital.

95
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:37,353
房间1-6-8。她的名字叫希柯蒂太太。
Room 1-6-8. She's there under the name of Mrs. Hickerty.

96
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,664
你可以进来了。
You may come in.

97
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,884
请不要太久，威尔逊先生。
Not too long, please, Mr. Wilson.

98
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,729
你的真名是什么，威尔逊先生?
What is your real name, Mr. Wilson?

99
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,070
——阿尔瓦Jesper。-我知道你的工作。
- Alvah Jesper. - I know your work.

100
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,407
感谢上帝你来了。你不知道我有多感激你。
Thank god you've come. You don't know how indebted I am to you.

101
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,994
对我?
To me?

102
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:41,792
当人们发现你所做的一切，他们会知道你不仅是一位伟大的物理学家，还是一位伟大的女性。
When people find out what you've done, they'll know you're not only a great physicist, but a great woman.

103
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,713
也许吧。故事还没有结束。
Maybe. The story isn't ended yet.

104
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:56,349
人们会怎么想?你会怎么想……-如果我回德国?——回去?
What will people think? What will you think... - If I were to go back to Germany? - Go back?

105
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:01,020
但这不是你翻越阿尔卑斯山或者联系我们的原因。
Oh, but that isn't why you crossed the alps or got in touch with us.

106
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:06,067
不。但你看，我以为我在这里很安全。
No. But you see, I thought I'd be safe here.

107
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,820
我不是。德国人找到我了。
I'm not. The Germans have found me here.

108
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,657
昨天我收到一封盖着苏黎世邮戳的信。
Yesterday I got a letter postmarked Zurich.

109
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,077
我要去意大利工作。
I'm to go to Italy to work.

110
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,162
我一直在那里和波尔达合作。
I've been collaborating there with polda.

111
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:22,375
——Giovanni polda ?——是的。
- Giovanni polda? - Yes.

112
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:33,261
如果我不回去，从周日开始，每天都有十个匈牙利反纳粹分子被带出集中营并被枪毙。
If I don't return, beginning Sunday, ten anti-Nazi Hungarians are to be taken out of concentration camps... And shot each day.

113
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:40,434
每天，他们都会给我一封写有名字的信。
Each day, they promise me a letter with names.

114
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,526
带着死者的照片。
With photographs of the dead people.

115
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,700
所以德国人在研究原子武器?
So the Germans are working on atomic weapons?

116
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,328
意大利人。他们正在协调。
Italians too. They are coordinated.

117
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:03,541
如果你回去，你的工作帮助他们成功，会发生什么?
Then what would happen if you went back and your work helped them to succeed?

118
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,043
如果我留在这里会怎么样?
What happens if I stay here?

119
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:13,593
我不能眼睁睁地看着无辜的人因为我而被枪杀。
I can't live knowing that innocent people are being shot because of me.

120
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,182
我将回去。
I'll go back.

121
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:25,313
我将毒药。我无法做出其他决定。
I'll take poison. I can't decide any other way.

122
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:39,410
不如你回去和波尔达医生一起工作吧?
Suppose you went back to work with Dr. Polda?

123
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,373
但是你在工作中遇到过困难吗?障碍。
But you met difficulties in your work? Obstacles.

124
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,461
——明白了吗?——是的。
- Understand? - Yes.

125
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,882
这是可能的。这是可能的。
That's possible. That's possible.

126
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,553
如果你觉得自己足够强大，你也可以帮助我们，提供一些信息。
And if you felt strong enough for it, you could help us, too, with information.

127
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:02,642
-有沟通的方式吗?-我想是的。
- There are ways of communicating? - I think so.

128
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:12,443
我得和你讨论一下。必须做出安排，相信我，我有足够的力量去做这件事。
I'll have to discuss it. Arrangements will have to be made, and- believe me, I would be strong enough for that.

129
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:16,197
但你得快点。他们只给了我周日的期限。
But you have to hurry. They've given me only until Sunday.

130
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,783
在我回去之前，我们得谈谈。
Before I go back, we have to talk.

131
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,537
我需要你提供的所有信息。
I'll need every bit of information you have.

132
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:31,462
如果你知道当英国人轰炸挪威的重水工厂时，他们是如何击退他们的，这对他们来说意味着几个月的延迟。
If you only knew how the British set them back... When they bombed that heavy water plant in Norway it meant a delay of months for them.

133
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,591
但如果你不能安排呢?
But what if you can't arrange this?

134
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:40,221
-可以安排。——我将
- It can be arranged. - I will

135
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,313
噢,我忘了。他们一直在担心我的肺。我该照x光了。
Oh, I forgot. They keep worrying over my lungs. I'm due for an X-ray.

136
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,733
-我很乐意等。-明天早上再来。
- I'll be glad to wait. - Come back tomorrow morning.

137
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,821
那我就更有力气了。我们可以聊一整天。
I'll have more strength then. We can talk all day.

138
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,948
什么都不用担心。
Don't worry about anything.

139
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,662
今晚我将睡觉。
Tonight I'll sleep.

140
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,748
知道你能入睡的感觉真好。
Such a good feeling to know you can sleep.

141
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,714
-有我的电话吗?——不,先生。
- Are there any calls for me? - No, sir.

142
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,299
我在等一个电话。请在吧台那边叫我好吗?
I'm expecting a call. Will you please have me paged at the bar?

143
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,592
很高兴,先生。
Glad to, sir.

144
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:25,057
哦,对不起。莱西，你怎么了?
Oh, excuse me. Lassie, what's the matter with you?

145
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:30,062
非常抱歉。她总是被人踩在脚下。
I'm terribly sorry. She's always getting caught under people's feet.

146
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,648
那是狗的特权。
That's a dog's privilege.

147
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,750
——马提尼。——是的,先生。
- Martini. - Yes, sir.

148
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,002
请非常干燥。
Very dry, please.

149
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,305
是的。这一定是个美国人。
Yah. This must be an American.

150
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,269
看你穿的衣服，点的酒，肯定是美国人。
By your clothes, the drink you ordered, surely an American.

151
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,566
而且你是新来的。
And by the fact that you are new in this hotel.

152
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,152
也许你就这么结束了?
Perhaps you are just over, huh?

153
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,865
祝健康!
Prosit!

154
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,038
告诉我，哦，哦。原谅我!
Tell me, oh, oh. Pardon me!

155
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,457
没关系。
It's all right.

156
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,754
告诉我,朋友。我们会赢吗?
Tell me, friend. Are we going to win?

157
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,674
我是说我们的事业。当然,我反纳粹。
Our cause, I mean. Naturally, I'm anti-Nazi.

158
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,514
最大的问题是美国的工业。
The big question is American industry.

159
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:04,198
例如，如果钢铁产量能达到9500万吨，那么我们就赢了。
If steel production, for instance, can go to 95 million tons, then we will win.

160
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:09,286
现在告诉我，在美国过得怎么样?
So now tell me, how are things in america, huh?

161
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,038
原谅我。
Excuse me.

162
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,876
原谅我。
Pardon me.

163
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,381
你非常介意我坐下吗?
Would you mind terribly if I sat down?

164
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,927
哦,我明白了。
Oh, I see.

165
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,682
我们的盖世太保朋友一直在压榨你。他对新来的人都这样。
Our gestapo friend has been pumping you. He does that to everyone new around here.

166
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,100
谢谢你！
Thank you.

167
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,230
-我叫安德鲁·威尔逊。-我叫安·道森。
- My name is Andrew Wilson. - Mine's Ann Dawson.

168
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,691
-你说话像个美国人。——我。
- You talk like an American. - I am.

169
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,404
你知道，那边的弗里茨，他不是很危险，但他是个可怕的讨厌鬼。
You know, Fritz over there, he's not very dangerous, but he's a frightful bore.

170
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,323
-你最好离他远点。——威尔逊先生吗?
- You better stay away from him. - Mr. Wilson?

171
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,703
威尔逊先生，有你的电话。
Call for you, Mr. Wilson.

172
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,376
——谢谢。我可以吗?——当然。
- Thank you. May I? - Certainly.

173
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,131
——威尔逊说。——仔细听。
- Wilson speaking. - Listen carefully.

174
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,466
没必要的话，别在电话里说任何话。
Don't say anything over this phone you don't have to.

175
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,345
——是吗?-一定是哪里出问题了。
- Yes? - Something must have got snafued.

176
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,764
你遇到了双杀。为什么- - - - - -
You've run into a double play. Why did-

177
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,440
和你坐在一起的那位小姐是那边最狡猾的操作员之一。
that tootsie you're sitting with is one of the slickest operators on the other side.

178
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:25,112
把酒倒下去，但不要太快，让酒慢慢淡下去。在本垒等我。
Knock down that grog, but not too fast, and fade. Wait for me at home plate.

179
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:34,997
——麻烦?-没什么我处理不了的。
- Trouble? - Nothing I can't handle.

180
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,896
我们陷入困境了。他们发现了你的事。
We're in a jam. They found out about you.

181
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,024
你向他们通风报信了。你犯了个错误。
Somewhere along the line you tipped them off. You made a mistake.

182
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,235
-我完全按照指示做了。-那他们是怎么绑架洛多医生的?
- I followed instructions to the letter. - Then how did they kidnap Dr. Lodor?

183
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,989
你在说什么?我今天早上见过她。
What are you talking about? I saw her this morning.

184
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,367
从你见到她到现在，她消失了。
Between the time you saw her and now, she disappeared.

185
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,328
她没有走出去。她被绑架。
She didn't walk out. She was kidnapped.

186
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,499
当我看到那个叫道森的女人和你在一起时，我就知道有什么不对劲。
I knew there was something up when I saw that Dawson woman with you.

187
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,796
你去机场后都在干什么?把每个动作都告诉我。
What have you been doing since the time you hit the airport? Give me every move.

188
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,801
-我通过了海关。-你说什么?
- I came through the customs. - What did you say?

189
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,513
-告诉他们我在值班。——什么?
- Told them I was in watches. - Nothing else?

190
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,264
——继续。
- Go on.

191
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,227
门口有个摄影师。
At the barrier, there was a photographer.

192
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,150
他看起来不像那篇文章，所以我没让他给我拍照。
He didn't look like the real article, so I didn't let him snap my photo.

193
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,440
那就是你的错误。
Thafsit that's your mistake.

194
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,985
我们一直在远离洛多。
We've been keeping away from lodor.

195
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,488
你没让他给你拍照，他们知道你是有原因的。所以他们跟踪了你。
You didn't let him take your picture, they knew you had a reason. So they trailed you.

196
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,282
所以他们才知道你见过洛多。所以他们抓走了她。
That's how they knew you saw lodor. That's why they snatched her.

197
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,076
所以他们才让道森盯着你。
That's why they put Dawson on you.

198
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,123
我以为我很聪明。
I thought I was being smart.

199
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,186
算了吧。你是怎么知道的?你是这一行的新手。
Forget it. How were you to know? You're new at this business.

200
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,066
所以他们绑架了她。
So they kidnapped her.

201
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,530
我们可以做点什么。
There's something we can do about it.

202
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,496
找到道森的房间号码。我得到的想法。
Get the number of Dawson's room. I'm getting ideas.

203
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,208
与此同时，让你进一步了解这个叫道森的女人。
Meanwhile, let your acquaintance with this Dawson woman develop.

204
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,086
你好。请告诉我道森太太的房间号码好吗?
Hello. Will you tell me the number of Mrs. Dawson's room, please?

205
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,507
呃,谢谢你。不，你不必打电话给她。
Uh, thank you. No, you needn't call her.

206
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,344
- 221。- 221。
- 221. - 221.

207
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,892
-你有火柴吗?-好的，先生，给你。
- You got a match? - Yes, sir. Here you are.

208
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,937
哦，不用麻烦了，先生，我去给您取。谢谢你！
Oh, don't bother, sir. I'll pick them up for you. Thank you.

209
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,100
你好，你真准时。进来。
Hello, you're certainly prompt. Come in.

210
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,774
你不坐下吗?晚饭前喝一杯吗?
Won't you sit down? Have a drink before dinner?

211
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,193
——谢谢。-我去拿我的围巾。
- Thank you. - I'll just get my wrap.

212
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,864
别管包装了。我们今晚不吃饭了。
Never mind the wrap. We'll skip dinner this evening.

213
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,909
——真的吗?-我有些东西要读给你听。
- Really? - I have something to read to you.

214
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,329
哦。你在给我写诗吗?
Oh. Are you writing me poetry?

215
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:52,838
在某种程度上，是的。这是一首十四行诗的副本，几分钟后就会送到德国领事馆。
In a way, yes. This is a copy of a sonnet... Which will be dropped off at the German consulate within a few minutes.

216
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,091
是写在银行信纸上的。
It's written on bank stationery.

217
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:02,806
上面写着:“亲爱的先生们，我只是这家银行的一名职员，”但我是德国真正的朋友。
It reads, "dear sirs, I am only a clerk in this bank, "but I'm a true friend of Germany.

218
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:14,818
“您应该知道，有个叫安·道森的人，大概对我们很友好，最近在我们这儿存了五千美元。”
"You ought to know that a certain Ann Dawson, presumably friendly to us, has recently deposited with us the sum of 5,000 American dollars."

219
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,737
哦,那太荒唐了。
Oh, that's ridiculous.

220
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:26,413
陪同她去银行的是一个高大的美国人，"我以前从未见过他。
"She was accompanied to the bank by a tall American, "whom I have never seen before.

221
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,457
“是他付的钱。”
"It was he who paid over the money."

222
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,670
-署名:“一个警惕的朋友。”-但是我-呃。postscript。
- Signed, "a watchful friend." - But i- uh-uh. There's a postscript.

223
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,341
“道森太太和那个高个子美国人似乎很相亲相爱。”
"Mrs. Dawson and that tall American seemed very fond of each other."

224
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:42,095
但我不明白，这一切意味着什么，德国领事馆为什么要对我感兴趣?
But I don't understand, what does all this mean, and why should the German consulate be interested in me?

225
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,015
我在瑞士是因为我丈夫。
I'm in Switzerland because of my husband.

226
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,268
他在空军服役。他被击落了，现在在这里实习。
He's in the air force. He was shot down, and he's interned here.

227
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,188
-我是美国人。——从技术上说,是的。
- I'm an American. - Technically, yes.

228
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,358
你在美国出生，在那里长大。
You were born in america, you were raised there.

229
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,155
但在1935年，你以希尔达·温特斯的名义加入了德美同盟。
But in 1935, you joined the German-American bunde under the name of hilda winters.

230
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,534
1937年，你因组织反犹太和反黑人骚乱而被捕。
In 1937, you were arrested for organising anti-semitic and anti-negro riots.

231
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,997
1939年，你在柏林的哥伦比亚大厦，为盖世太保工作。
In 1939, you were in the Columbia house, Berlin, working for the gestapo.

232
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,834
从1940年开始，你就在瑞士工作。
Since 1940, you've been operating in Switzerland.

233
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,005
是的，你的确是一个美国人，但是承认这一点让我很不舒服。
Yes, you're an American all right, but it makes my stomach crawl to admit it.

234
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,758
你撒谎的猪!
You lying pig!

235
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,594
你以为盖世太保会相信这种拙劣的诬陷吗?
Do you think the gestapo will believe a clumsy frame-up like this?

236
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:27,474
我想他们会的。我们很快就会知道了。
I think they will. We'll find out soon enough.

237
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:34,398
现在7:28。我七点半会接到一个电话。
It's now 7:28. I'll be getting a phone call at 7:30.

238
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,943
如果到时你还没告诉我我想知道的事，信就会送到。
If you haven't told me what I want to know by then, the letter will be delivered.

239
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,486
他们会嘲笑你的。
Why, they'll laugh at it.

240
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,575
我想他们会做些检查的。
I rather think they'll do some checking.

241
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,453
一个长得像你的女人今天和我一起在银行。
A woman who looks like you was in the bank with me today.

242
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,915
她的签名和你的一模一样。
Her signature was an exact duplicate of yours.

243
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,835
看。
Look.

244
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,718
他们一定时常为你担心。
They must have been worried about you from time to time.

245
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,845
他们有个理论，一旦是德国人，就永远是德国人。
They have a theory, once a German, always a German.

246
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,973
这可能也适用于美国人。
It may apply to Americans too.

247
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,642
他们知道我不会背叛他们。他们知道我有多忠诚。
They know I wouldn't betray them. They know how loyal I've been.

248
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:15,439
直到一个美国探员对你下手。给你钱。
Until an American agent went to work on you. Offered you money.

249
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:20,402
与此同时，也重新点燃了我内心深处微弱的爱国主义火花。
And at the same time, rekindled that faint spark of patriotism deep down inside.

250
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:25,949
你知道吗，如果他们杀你的原因泄露出去，你可能会成为一个女英雄。
You know, if it ever gets out why they shot you, you may end up as a heroine.

251
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,457
我只想知道凯特琳·洛多在哪里?
All I want to know is where is katerin lodor?

252
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:40,505
如果你告诉我，那封信就会被销毁。
If you tell me, the letter will be destroyed.

253
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,746
安德鲁!请相信我，我不知道她在哪里。
Andrew! Please believe me, I don't know where she is.

254
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,672
发出去
Send it

255
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,053
——等等!——等等。
- wait! - Hang on.

256
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,937
她在雪绒花滑雪俱乐部。
She's at the edelweiss ski club.

257
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:44,194
沿着山路从穆阿特村出发。
Up the mountain road... From the village of mouat.

258
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,406
现在是关闭的。
It's closed now.

259
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,216
-怎么样?-一切都井然有序。
- How is it? - Everything in order.

260
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,302
图书馆里的一个守卫。楼上的另一个睡着了。
One guard in the library. The other upstairs asleep.

261
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,013
护士睡着了。Lodor的房间门。
Nurse asleep. Lodor's room door.

262
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,224
开始,埃里克。
Get started, Eric.

263
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:20,397
我们进去后，你要坚守岗位。
Take your post when we go in.

264
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,435
护士!得到她!
The nurse! Get her!

265
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,819
让我走!
Let me go!

266
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,677
嗯,就是这样。
Well, that's that.

267
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,247
世界上大概还有十个人有她这样的头脑。
In the whole world there were perhaps ten people with a mind equal to hers.

268
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:29,336
有一次，为了解决一个问题，她发明了一套全新的数学体系。
Once, to solve a problem, she invented a whole new system of mathematics.

269
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,714
她本可以完成的工作。
The work she still could have done.

270
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,260
-所以你来瑞士就白来了?——没有。
- So you came to Switzerland for nothing? - No.

271
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,388
你是说“不”吗?
Did you say, "no"?

272
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:44,726
她告诉我，她一直在和一个叫乔瓦尼·波尔达的意大利人合作。
She told me she had been working with an Italian, Giovanni polda.

273
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:50,732
德国的顶尖科学家都是有良好声望的纳粹党员。
The leading German scientists are all Nazi party members in good standing.

274
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,319
战前我和波尔达通信。
I corresponded with polda before the war.

275
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,740
-他当时很友好。-你怎么知道他现在很友好?
- He was friendly then. - How do you know he's friendly now?

276
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:04,079
我不喜欢。但下一步必须是意大利
I don't. But the next step has to be Italy

277
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,804
三十秒。
Thirty seconds.

278
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:22,991
-你的意大利朋友很准时。——好。我们走吧，艾。
- Your Italian friends are on time, it. - Good. Let's shove off, ai.

279
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,993
谢谢你,队长。
Thank you, captain.

280
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,412
祝你好运。
Good luck.

281
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,490
-把她拉进来。狐猴的一种,先生。
- Haul her in. - Aye-aye, sir.

282
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,486
上车吧,。
Hop in, al.

283
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,384
我猜你是从墨索里尼那里租的这辆车。
I suppose you rent this truck from Mussolini.

284
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,637
排序的。司机白天为他工作，晚上为我们工作。
Sort of. The driver works for him by day and for us at night.

285
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,306
-可以抽烟吗?——确定。
- All right to smoke? - Sure.

286
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,227
——谢谢。——谢谢。
- Thanks. - Grazie.

287
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,321
哦。吉娜见面。
Oh. Meet Gina.

288
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,325
吉娜，这位是柏林威廉大帝研究所的纳尔海姆博士。
Gina, meet herr Dr. Nalheim of the kaiser Wilhelm institute in Berlin.

289
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:39,539
-我们叫他ai。-你好，你好。
- We call him ai. - Hello, ai hello.

290
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,089
不,混乱关系。
No, tre.

291
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,159
Documenti, Documenti !
Documenti, documenti!

292
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,869
杀了香烟。
Kill the cigarettes.

293
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,541
您看!您看!
Presto! Presto!

294
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,298
-我不会说意大利语，一个都不会?
- I don't talk Italian - not even any?

295
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,300
我知道但丁的一节诗。
I know one verse from Dante.

296
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,513
你这次的任务是什么?
What kind of a mission do you make this time?

297
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,724
你穿得连德国医生都不合适。
You're not even dressed right for a German doctor.

298
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,560
哦,别担心。我会成为一个德国医生的。
Oh, don't worry. I'll be a German doctor all right.

299
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,105
波达知道他要来吗?
Does polda know he's coming?

300
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,441
我们要给他一个惊喜。
We're going to surprise him.

301
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,528
——这是疯了。-这是一个非常重要的任务。
- That's crazy. - This is a very important mission.

302
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:05,328
非常。我们所有人都有一个工作要做。
Very. All of us have one job to do.

303
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:09,373
那就是把ai安全带进去见波达医生，然后再把他带出来。
That's to take ai safely in to see Dr. Polda, and then take him out again.

304
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,464
好吧。
All right.

305
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,384
现在波尔达总是从实验室回家吃午饭。
Now polda always comes home from his laboratory for noon dinner.

306
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,013
之后，他睡了一个小时。然后他在他的书房工作。
After that, he sleeps for one hour. Then he works in his study.

307
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,098
他下午有客人吗?
Does he have visitors in the afternoon?

308
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,647
在我观察房子并得到报告的十天里，只有三个人来过。
Well, in the ten days I watched the house and get reports, only three visitors came.

309
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,068
-谁在房子里?——一个管家。老女人，善良，愚蠢。
- Who's in the house? - A housekeeper. Old woman, nice, stupid.

310
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,821
一个厨师。好厨师。法西斯。
A cook. Good cook. Fascist.

311
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:46,160
还有四个秘密警察。Ovra男人。两天。两个晚上。
And four secret police. Ovra men. Two for day. Two for night.

312
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,537
-其中的首领是路易吉。-检查完毕了吗?
- And the chief of them is Luigi. - Is it all checked?

313
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:52,083
有天晚上我把他灌醉了，他问过我。
Checked from the cook when I got him drunk one night.

314
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
从和我们在一起的波尔达牙医罗摩里医生那里查到的。
Checked from Dr. Romoli, dentist of polda who is with us.

315
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:58,965
每天都被马soli和他的行为所检查，被我的眼睛所检查。
Checked by marsoli and his ways and checked by my eyes every day.

316
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,927
现在你知道一流的信使能做什么了。
Now you know what a first-rate courier can do.

317
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,013
你很擅长这个，战后我会给你找份工作。
You're so good at this, I'll get you a job at it after the war.

318
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,516
-我不喜欢你那样说话。-我只是开个玩笑。
- I don't like you to talk like that. - I was only joking.

319
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,436
-我不喜欢你开玩笑。——我很抱歉。
- I don't like yourjoking. - I'm sorry.

320
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,941
-你对路易吉了解多少?-一个聪明人。训练有素。
- What do you know about Luigi? - A smart man. Well trained.

321
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,777
这是令人欣慰的。
That's comforting.

322
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,779
我怎么去房子呢?
How do I get to the house itself?

323
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:26,826
去房子的事已经安排好了。但要想进去……
To get to the house has been arranged. But to get inside...

324
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,417
威廉二世研究所的纳尔海姆博士来见波尔达教授。
Dr. Nalheim from kaiser Wilhelm institute to see professor polda.

325
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:27,386
威廉二世研究所的纳尔海姆博士来见波尔达教授。
Dr. Nalheim from kaiser Wilhelm institute to see professor polda.

326
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,056
——Passaporto。-说德语。
- Passaporto. - Sprechen sie deutsch.

327
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,224
护照请。
Passport please.

328
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,078
——Nalheim博士?
- Dr. Nalheim?

329
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,093
Kaiser Wilhelm研究所。
Kaiser Wilhelm institute.

330
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,849
谢谢,doktor先生。
Danke, herr doktor.

331
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:38,249
谢谢。
Danke.

332
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,500
我不是纳尔海姆医生。
I'm not doctor nalheim.

333
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:27,131
我是美国物理学家，我的名字是——我不在乎你叫什么!
I'm an American physicist and my name is- I don't care what your name is!

334
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,092
-你是美国人!-波达医生，听着。
- You're an American! - Dr. Polda, listen.

335
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,679
我不想听!
I don't want to listen!

336
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:38,767
你来这里真是疯了。你怎么敢把我置于如此危险的境地。
You're insane to come here. How dare you put me in such danger.

337
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,943
几年前，你给我写了一封信。
A few years ago, you wrote me a letter.

338
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:54,909
在结尾处你说，“只有服务于全人类的自由科学，才能成为优秀的科学。”
At the end of it you said, "only a free science in the service... Of all humanity can be a good science."

339
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,833
-你是谁?——阿尔瓦Jesper。
- Who are you? - Alvah Jesper.

340
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,461
它是什么?
What is it?

341
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:15,888
谢谢。
Grazie.

342
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,699
谢谢你！
Thank you.

343
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,664
好吧。我不能背叛我的科学家同事。
All right. I can't betray a fellow scientist.

344
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:53,759
但你一定是疯了才会来这里。我们没什么可谈的。
But you must be insane to come here. We have nothing to talk over.

345
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,470
什么都没有。
Nothing.

346
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,182
请走吧。
Please go.

347
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:05,020
-你在研究核裂变。——是明智的。走了。
- You're working on nuclear fission. - Be sensible. Go.

348
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:09,441
你在为纳粹工作。我知道。
You're working for the Nazis. I know that.

349
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:11,569
但我不敢相信你愿意这么做。
But I can't believe you're doing it willingly.

350
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,363
哦,心甘情愿,情愿。这有什么关系?
Oh, willingly, unwillingly. What does it matter?

351
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,200
你无权来这里危及我的生命。
You have no right to jeopardise me by coming here.

352
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:22,454
我有这个权利。卡特琳·洛多给了我权利。
I have the right. Katerin lodor gave me the right.

353
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:29,336
-你看见卡特琳了?-就在纳粹杀死她之前。
- You saw katerin? - Just before the Nazis killed her.

354
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,847
Katerin,死了。
Katerin, dead.

355
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,689
——Katerin,死了。——被谋杀的。
- Katerin, dead. - Murdered.

356
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:53,652
她死是因为她不让罪犯利用她的科学知识。
She died because she wouldn't let criminals use her science.

357
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:57,615
-但你让他们利用了你。-你想要什么?
- But you're letting them use you. - So what do you want?

358
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,950
他们会把我也杀了吗?
That they should murder me too?

359
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:05,247
——不。但我需要信息。-我要我的生活。
- No. But I want information. - And I want my life.

360
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:13,380
这是那个从皇家学院辞职而不愿与墨索里尼握手的乔瓦尼·波尔达吗?
Is this the Giovanni polda who resigned from the royal academy... Rather than shake hands with Mussolini?

361
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:18,093
好吧。我变成了一个懦夫。鄙视我。
All right. I've become a weakling. Despise me.

362
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,763
我不在乎别人。
I don't care about people.

363
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:24,266
我只关心我自己。只有我自己。
I care about myself. Only myself.

364
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:28,896
你就是在说谎。这可不是伟大的波尔达人在说话。
You're lying. That's not the great polda talking.

365
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,066
你在害怕什么?他们对你有什么把柄?
What are you afraid of? What hold do they have on you?

366
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:37,154
把柄?没有把柄。我像空气一样自由。
Hold? No hold. I'm free as air.

367
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:45,162
他们所拥有的是这个世界上我唯一关心的人，我的女儿玛丽亚。
All they have is the only person in the world I care about, my daughter Maria.

368
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:49,625
他们抓了她。他的主人和我的主人。
They have her. His masters and mine.

369
00:52:51,794 --> 00:53:01,470
我把他的肖像保存在这里，这样别人就会认为我很爱国。这样我就有东西可恨了。
I keep his portrait here so others will think I'm patriotic... And so I can have something to hate.

370
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:09,770
自从创世以来，从来没有一个人像我这样憎恨别人。
Not since the beginning of time... Has there been a man who has a hatred like me.

371
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:15,818
-那就跟他们打。-他们抓了我女儿。
- Then fight them. - They have my daughter.

372
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:20,072
他们让她每周给我寄一张明信片。
They let her send me a postcard once a week.

373
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,116
我让他们向我讨教。
And I let them pick my brains.

374
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:29,832
每周，我都会哭一次。
Once a week, I cry.

375
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:36,338
其他的晚上我喝酒。
The other nights I drink.

376
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,300
现在他们威胁要带她去德国。
Now they threaten to take her into Germany.

377
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:44,012
我说了一些他们不喜欢的话。只是一件小事。
I said something they didn't like. Only a little thing.

378
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,269
我忘了我自己。
I forgot myself.

379
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,439
你不知道他们也可以带你去德国吗?
Don't you know they can take you into Germany too?

380
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,984
他们被推到这里。你觉得他们撤退后会离开你吗?
They're being pushed back here. You think they'll leave you if they retreat?

381
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:02,740
不。他们不会离开我的。除非我被榨干了。
No. They won't leave me. Not till I'm squeezed dry.

382
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:09,079
-但你还是会服侍他们?-他们抓了玛丽亚。
- But still you'll serve them? - They have Maria.

383
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,039
为了她，我愿意为任何人服务。
For her I'll serve anyone.

384
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,129
如果她在另一个国家是安全的呢?
Suppose she were safe in another country?

385
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,801
——什么?-可以的。她在哪里呢?
- What? - It can be done. Where is she?

386
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:25,846
她被允许在佩鲁贾的一家酒店被看守。
She's permitted to leave under guard in a hotel in perugia.

387
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,932
albergo精益求精。
The albergo excelsior.

388
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:36,607
让她留在英国吧。美国。给我一个她的笔迹。我们可以做得更好。我们也可以带你出去。
Let her be in england. America. Give me one letter in her handwriting... We can do better than that. We can take you out too.

389
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,780
你不是在和一个又老又病的人玩吧?
You are not playing with an old, sick man?

390
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:48,035
——没有。-这对她来说很危险，不是吗?
- No. - It will be dangerous for her, won't it?

391
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,163
它可以安排，安全。
It can be arranged, safely.

392
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,248
你可以相信我。
You can trust me.

393
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,918
信任你吗?
Trust you?

394
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:01,548
我在法西斯主义统治下生活太久了。我不相信任何人。
I've lived too long under fascism. I trust no one.

395
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:06,762
但我做了一笔生意。如果你帮我，我就帮你。
But a business bargain I make. If you help me, I'll help you.

396
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,474
在那之前，别以为我是个傻瓜。我什么都不会告诉你。
Until then, don't think I'm a fool. I'll tell you nothing.

397
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,144
如果你是这种情况，波尔达医生。
If those are your conditions, Dr. Polda.

398
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,730
是的。
Yes.

399
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:25,322
照我说的做，也许我又会变成老波尔达了。
Do it, and maybe I'll become the old polda again.

400
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:29,243
"为人类服务的自由科学"
"A free science in the service of humanity."

401
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,830
“可以是唯一好的科学。”
"Can be the only good science."

402
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:39,670
现在来。我最好带你经过我的看门狗。
Come now. I'd better take you past my watchdogs.

403
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:09,449
-再见，教授先生。-再见，纳尔海姆博士。
- Auf wiedersehen, herr professor. - Auf wiedersehen, Dr. Nalheim.

404
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,956
再会。

405
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:19,877
再会。

406
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,532
要找到波达的女儿可不是件容易的事。
Getting polda's daughter won't be any cinch.

407
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,034
我们该怎么做呢?
How do we go about it?

408
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:58,832
-我和他会处理的。你待着别动。-我也许能你也许能让我们陷入困境。这是所有。
- He and I will go about it. You stay put. - I might be able You might be able to land us in the soup. That's all.

409
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,336
你能在意大利闲逛多久不碰上盖世太保?
How long can you wander around Italy without running into the gestapo?

410
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,670
或者是ovra ?
Or the ovra?

411
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:07,382
你以为他们不会跟柏林核实你的文件吗?
You think they won't check your papers with Berlin?

412
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,719
不，先生，你待着别动，否则交易取消。
No, sir. You stay put or the deal is off.

413
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,056
好吧。我可以住在哪里?
Okay. Where can I stay?

414
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,605
-你有食品券吗?——是的。
- Do you have any food stamps? - Yes.

415
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,941
那这就是最好的地方。
Then this is the best place.

416
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,320
别让人看见，等着。
Just keep out of sight, and wait.

417
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:48,799
……如果我们抓到波尔达的女儿，我就在报纸上发布雷纳尔多·阿马迪中尉的死讯。
If... If we get polda's daughter, I'll put a notice in the papers announcing the death in action... Of lieutenant- lieutenant rinaldo amadi.

418
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:54,137
——Amadi ?——嗯。A-m-a-d-i。Amadi。
- Amadi? - Mm-hmm. A-m-a-d-i. Amadi.

419
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:58,016
当你看到它的时候，去罗莫利，波尔达的牙医。
When you see it, go to romoli's, polda's dentist.

420
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,144
他会让教授去找你的。
He'll have the professor there for you.

421
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:04,356
在北部有游击队的飞机场。我们将乘飞机去。
There are partisan airfields in the north. We'll go out by plane.

422
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,734
-你知道葡萄园吗，皮纳罗?——是的。
- You know the vineyard, pinaro's? - Yes.

423
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,987
采取polda那里。

424
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:15,242
-你可能要多久?-需要多久就多久。
- How long are you likely to be? - As long as it takes.

425
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,954
-大概一周吧。-如果你找不到玛丽亚怎么办?
- A week maybe. - What if you don't get Maria?

426
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,790
如果我们完全没收到你的消息怎么办?
What if we don't hear from you at all?

427
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,626
战争的命运，艾。那你就只能靠自己了。
The fortunes of war, ai. You'll be on your own then.

428
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,796
这是你的外套。
Here's your coat.

429
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,007
谢谢你！谢谢。
Thank you. Grazie.

430
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:36,638
-就像新的一样。——Marsoli。Andiamo。
- It's just like new. - Marsoli. Andiamo.

431
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,520
——祝你好运。-吉娜，你能到外面看看吗?
- Good luck. - Gina, will you look outside please?

432
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,000
没关系。
It's all right.

433
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,343
吉娜,再见。
Gina, arrivederci.

434
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,015
——再见。-我会再见你的。
- Arrivederci. - I'll be seeing you.

435
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:52,130
好吧，别客气。
Well, make yourself at home.

436
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,091
谢谢。
Thanks.

437
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,685
我想让我在你手上比你想的要多。
I guess having me here on your hands was more than you bargained for.

438
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:09,356
在工作中，我们取其所来。
In our work we take what comes.

439
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,196
请不要再打量我了。
Please stop looking me over.

440
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,533
你长得很好看。
You're nice to look at.

441
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,413
我们就像歌剧中的一幕。
Just like a scene in the opera, we are.

442
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,959
百姓去。留下这对年轻夫妇独自一人。
The people go. The young couple is left alone.

443
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:33,171
快，这个年轻人一定要说些恭维话。这是预期。
Quick, the young man must make compliments. It's expected.

444
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:37,592
只是这里没有音乐，你也不是男高音。
Only there isn't any music, and you are not a tenor.

445
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,347
有你自己的方式，但在你了解我之前不要加我。
Have it your own way, but don't add me up before you know me.

446
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,773
我们要听一整晚吗?
Are we gonna have to listen to that all night?

447
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,901
也许你可以问问猫。
Maybe you ask the cat.

448
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,070
你满脑子都是醋，不是吗?
You're full of vinegar, aren't you?

449
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,907
这听起来饿了。
It sounds hungry.

450
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,785
如果人们饿了，只有猫才会饿。
Well, if people are hungry, it's only natural cats should be.

451
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,872
你有牛奶吗?
Have you got any milk for it?

452
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,084
牛奶吗?哦,我记得。
Milk? Oh, I remember.

453
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:13,211
它来自奶牛，不是吗?
It comes from cows, no?

454
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,422
好的婴儿。
Good for babies.

455
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,927
不过，我还是讨厌听到猫哭。也许来块面包。
Still, I hate to hear a cat cry. Maybe a piece of bread.

456
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,930
美国人喜欢猫，嗯?
The American likes cats, hmm?

457
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,642
只是你现在在欧洲。在这里，你可以在肉店里找到猫。
Only you're in Europe now. Here you find cats in butcher shops.

458
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:33,190
这是幸运的。但也许明天，就会掉进别人的炖锅里。
This one's been lucky. But by tomorrow maybe, plop into somebody's stew pot.

459
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:38,612
生活在一个不仅喂猫，而且还喂孩子的国家一定很好。
It must be nice to live in a country where not only cats are fed, but children.

460
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,408
拜托，我要去穿睡衣了。
Please, I'm going to put on my nightgown.

461
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,756
像你这样的女孩是怎么习惯这种生活的?
How does a girl like you get used to this kind of life?

462
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,508
你觉得会有人习惯吗?
Do you think anyone gets used to it?

463
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,094
我觉得你做得很好，吉娜。
I think you do wonderfully, Gina.

464
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:06,097
我从没见过这么有勇气的女孩。
I never knew a girl with so much courage.

465
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,183
勇气?
Courage?

466
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,854
你是个成年人，知道的那么少。
You're a grown-up man and know so little.

467
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:18,109
你不懂猫，也不懂人。-你怎么了，吉娜?
You know nothing about cats, - and nothing about people. - What's the matter with you, Gina?

468
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:21,112
哦，没关系，只不过你是从月球来的。
Oh, no matter, except you come from the moon.

469
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:24,658
而我们却像拉撒路一样生活。
And here we live like, like Lazarus.

470
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,870
我们躺在坟墓里等待救世主的到来。
We lie in the grave waiting for the saviour to come.

471
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:34,542
不过我不是从月球来的，像你这样的意大利人也不是随便躺着的。
Only I don't come from the moon, and Italians like you aren't just lying down.

472
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,975
你坐沙发太长了。你睡那张床。
You're too long for the couch. You take the bed.

473
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,769
——唔唔。在这项工作中，我们是同志。
- Mm-mmm. - In this work we're comrades.

474
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:56,606
——没有。-明天你的背就要断了。我希望。
- No. - Tomorrow you'll have a broken back. I hope.

475
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,692
谢谢。
Thanks.

476
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,686
嘿。
Hey.

477
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,730
谢谢你！
Thank you.

478
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,618
我再也听不到那只猫的声音了。
I don't hear that cat anymore.

479
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:55,248
在这个国家，连猫都知道哭是没有用的。
In this country even the cats learn it's no use to cry.

480
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,859
米迦，米迦，米迦，米迦，米迦。
Micha, micha, micha, micha, micha.

481
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,452
我希望她身上有跳蚤。
Here, I hope she has fleas.

482
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,669
对不起，我没有洋葱肝。
Excuse me, I have no liver with onions.

483
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,797
只有剩菜。
Only leftovers.

484
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,051
现在闭嘴，让我睡觉，否则我就把你扔出窗外。
Now you shut up and let me sleep, or I'll throw you right out the window.

485
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,688
晚安，各位。
Good night.

486
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,028
人工智能?
Ai?

487
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,113
是吗?
Yes?

488
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,912
我说的不全是真的。
I don't mean all I say.

489
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,167
我知道你不知道。
I know you don't.

490
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,421
晚安，各位。
Good night.

491
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,506
晚安，各位。
Good night.

492
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,564
不!
No!

493
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,362
吉娜。
Gina.

494
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,407
吉娜!
Gina!

495
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:59,914
不要担心。一切都是好的。
Don't be worried. Everything's all right.

496
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,168
哎，你为什么要叫醒我?
Ai, why do you wake me?

497
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,880
-为什么要这样吓唬我?-你在做梦。
- Why frighten me like this? - You were dreaming.

498
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,716
你在睡梦中哭泣。

01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,556
我记得。

501
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,601

告诉我可能会有帮助。
It might help to tell me about it.

503
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:31,529
你在散兵坑里战斗很久了，不是吗，吉娜?
You've been fighting in the foxholes a long time, haven't you, Gina?

504
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:47,921
今晚，我对自己说，现在，也许，也许，一整个星期，一切都会变得容易。
Tonight I, I say to myself, now maybe, maybe for, for a whole week, it'll be easy.

505
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,965
待在房间里。
Stay in the room.

506
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,426
唱歌一点。

507
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:57,847
灰尘洗碗。

508
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,142

01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,606
即使是在睡觉的时候。
Not even in sleep.

510
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,919
夫人多米尼克?
Signora Dominica?

511
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,352
它是什么?
What is it?

512
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,938
Si。
Si.

513
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,982
他的猫。他想要他的猫。

514
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:53,194
在那里。快。

515
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:04,163
谢谢,小姐,谢谢。
Grazie, signorina, grazie.

516
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,179
不，不是意大利人。

517
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:25,476
哦,congratulazioni,夫人。Congratulazioni。

Buona命运,夫人。Buona命运,夫人

520
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,085
布拉瓦。Bravissima。
brava. Bravissima.

521
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:55,423
那只猫。肯定是猫。
The cat. It had to be the cat.

522
01:08:55,506 --> 01:09:04,223
总是一些小事，一些我们无法计划的事情让我们最终落入警察手中。
It's always the little things, the things we can't plan that make us end up in the hands of the police.

523
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:10,021
-我们不能再呆在这里了。——为什么?
- We can't stay here any longer. - Why?

524
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,023
-他是特工吗?——没有。
- Is he an agent? - No.

525
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,652
但每个看门人都得报告家里有新来者。
But every janitor has to report any new person in the house.

526
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:20,782
我告诉他你是我丈夫。
I told him you're my husband.

527
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,285
你为什么这么做?
Why did you do that?

528
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,579
我不能去警局登记。
I can't register with the police.

529
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:30,833
-我们不能冒这个险——我知道。我犯了个错误。
- We can't risk that. - I know. I made a mistake.

530
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:39,092
-你知道其他安全屋吗?-我在思考。
- Do you know any other safe house? - I'm trying to think.

531
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,095
我们不能没日没夜地在街上走。我们肯定会被接走的。
We can't walk the streets day and night. We'd be picked up sure.

532
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,765
我知道。闭嘴，让我想想。
I know. Shut up for a minute, and let me think.

533
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,645
我们在这里完成。
We're finished here.

534
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:54,023
-这不是你的错。-我没必要说你是我丈夫。
- It's not your fault. - I didn't have to say you're my husband.

535
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,818
在我们的工作中没有那种骄傲的空间。
In our work there's no room for that sort of pride.

536
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:02,532
没有自尊，你就不会是吉娜，不要为你的自尊感到羞愧。
Without pride you wouldn't be Gina don't be ashamed of your pride.

537
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:10,998
昨晚，而现在，你说的话让我在这里感觉轻松多了。
Last night, and now, you say things that make me feel easier in here.

538
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,378
也许你觉得自己很仁慈。
Maybe you feel charity.

539
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:20,425
或者，你喜欢人?
Or maybe, you like people?

540
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,635
我喜欢猫。
Mostly I like cats.

541
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,064
这张照片是什么时候拍的，吉娜?
When was this picture taken, Gina?

542
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,362
就在战争之前。
Just before the war.

543
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,908
一百年前。
A hundred years ago.

544
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:11,976
运气吗?
Any luck?

545
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:16,898
一套公寓。两间房和一间浴室，住三天。
An apartment. Two rooms and a bath for three days.

546
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:20,443
——洗澡?是谁给了我们这些?-我曾经认识的一位女教师。
- A bath? Who's giving us all that? - A schoolmistress I once knew.

547
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,445
法西斯党员。
A fascist party member.

548
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:28,826
我告诉她我有一个德国朋友，非常重要，她非常以我为荣。
I told her I had a German friend who was very important, and she was very proud of me.

549
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,995
累了,吉娜吗?
Tired, Gina?

550
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:33,998
- - - - - -不坏。饿了吗?——嗯。
- Not bad. Hungry? - Hmm.

551
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,293
不,谢谢。
No, thanks.

552
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:41,422
苹果含有大量的能量。
There's a lot of energy in an apple.

553
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,100
那是什么?
What's that?

554
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,939
我一直在忙着等你呢。
Oh, I was trying to keep busy waiting for you.

555
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,983
但它是什么呢?
But what is it?

556
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:04,821
这叫做画正弦波的线积分。
It's called plotting the line integral of a sine wave.

557
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:07,198
哦，这并不像听起来那么难。
Oh, it's not as difficult as it sounds.

558
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:17,124
我想象着我正骑着其中的一匹马，试着算出我总共能走多远，同时上上下下。
I was imagining I was riding one of those horses, trying to figure out how far I would go altogether, going around and up and down at the same time.

559
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,339
上上下下的马。
Horses going up and down.

560
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,299
和孩子,音乐。
And kids, music.

561
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,639
-你来过这里吗，吉娜?——嗯。
- Ever come here, Gina? - Mm-hmm.

562
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,433
在战争之前。
Before the war.

563
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:39,772
音乐一直在播放“giovinezza”，一首法西斯歌曲。
The music played "giovinezza" all the time, a fascist song.

564
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,482
它破坏了我的兴致。
It spoiled it for me.

565
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:47,572
-你带着个男孩来?-是的。
- You come here with a boy? - Yeah.

566
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,824
你喜欢的那个?
One you liked?

567
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,619
他和我一起拍的照片。他演奏大提琴。
He was in the picture with me. He played the cello.

568
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,247
他现在在哪里?
Where is he now?

569
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,166
在某处。如果没有他的大提琴。
Somewhere. Without his cello.

570
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,965
也许战争结束后，我可能会回来。
Maybe after the war, I might come back.

571
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:14,307
我会带你来这里。但音乐会有所不同。
And I'd bring you here. But the music would be different.

572
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,270
战后会有很大的不同。
After the war a lot will be different.

573
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,232
但你不会回来了。
But you won't come back.

574
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,568
我可能会。为什么不呢?
I might. Why not?

575
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,282
现在的时间。我们可以去。
It's time now. We can go.

576
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,486
——哇。-今晚我是战前吉娜。
- Whoa. - Tonight I am pre-war Gina.

577
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,493
我在学校教我的小孩。
I teach my little children in school.

578
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:20,623
星期三我演奏室内乐。
Wednesday I play chamber music.

579
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,671
我很无辜的。
I'm very innocent.

580
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,718
我很容易脸红。
And I'm easy to blush.

581
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,433
-换一套衣服就可以了吗?-我们走着瞧吧。
- A change of clothes does all that? - Well, we'll see.

582
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,945
我还是很漂亮，不是吗?
I'm still pretty, no?

583
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,074
嗯，有一点。
Hmm, a little bit.

584
01:14:56,617 --> 01:15:02,873
即使你不这么认为，我遇到的所有男人，他们都说我很漂亮。
Well, even if you don't think so, all the ovra men I meet, they tell me I'm pretty.

585
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:28,983
我认识一个人他长得又高又高，他移动着他的身体，像一颗炮弹，再见吧，亲爱的，再见吧。
I know a man he is long and tall, he moves his body, like a cannonball, fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

586
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,819
——那是什么?-一首美国牛仔歌曲。
- What's that? - An American cowboy song.

587
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:40,411
别那么滑稽。你从新亚利桑那州飞来的一架飞机教我的。
Don't look so funny. One of your shot-down fliers from new Arizona taught it to me.

588
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,915
——新墨西哥州。——新亚利桑那州。
- New Mexico. - New Arizona.

589
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,626
好的,新的亚利桑那州。
Okay, new Arizona.

590
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,296
他教我的。
He taught it to me.

591
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,923
其余的我都不知道。
The rest I never learned.

592
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,384
只有第一行。
Only the first lines.

593
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,511
他非常的不错。
He was nice.

594
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,680
现在。
Now.

595
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,392
我看起来怎么样?
How do I look?

596
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,396
——战前。-你是说真的吗?
- Pre-war. - Do you mean it?

597
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,149
我当然知道。
Of course I do.

598
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,318
我不是奥夫拉人。
I'm no ovra man.

599
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:16,322
-你为什么这么说?-是你提出来的
- Why do you say that? - You brought it up.

600
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,825
哦。我猜你是嫉妒了。嗯?
Oh. You're jealous, I suppose. Hmm?

601
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,787
你觉得我就不能吃醋吗?
Do you think I couldn't be jealous?

602
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:25,331
你想让我跳舞吗?
Do you want me to dance?

603
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,512
也许我是嫉妒，吉娜
Maybe I am jealous, Gina

604
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:54,693
不，别跟我做爱。不要成为我喜欢的人。
No, don't make love to me. Don't be somebody I like.

605
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:59,365
如果你想吻我，我也想吻你，那我们就吻吧。
If you feel like kissing me, and I feel like kissing you, so we kiss.

606
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,700
但是不要太认真。
But don't be serious.

607
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:05,204
在我的工作中，我亲吻时没有感觉。
In my job, I kiss without feeling.

608
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,666
上周，一个留着傻胡子的男人。
Last week, an ovra man with a silly moustache.

吉娜,女孩。

612
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:26,767
你为什么一直抽自己，吉娜?
Why do you keep whipping yourself, Gina?

613
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:37,945
你觉得，你觉得在地下当个信使好吗?
Do you think, you think it's good, to be a courier in the underground?

614
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:41,574
你觉得这很刺激，很英勇。
You think it's exciting, heroic.

615
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,496
不。如果你和人渣斗争，你就会变成人渣。这是所有。
No. If you fight scum, you become scum. That's all.

616
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:50,499
不。我知道你是什么人。
No. I know what you are.

617
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,295
离照片上的小女孩不远。

到门口去。

619
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,941
-再见，夫人。,晚上好。

620
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,115

01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:48,265
-是谁?-两姐妹为战争中的孤儿募捐。
- Who was it? - Two sisters collecting charity, for children orphaned by the war.

623
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:51,352
-这有什么不对吗?——好吧,等待。
- Anything wrong with that? - Well, wait.

624
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,207
我们得离开这里。
We've got to get out of here.

625
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,168
-她们不是真正的姐妹。-你怎么知道?
- They're not real sisters. - How do you know?

626
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:19,880
他们停在街角的一辆汽车旁。
They're stopping at an automobile parked on the corner.

627
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,799
-我们被监视了。来吧。-让我看看。
- We're being watched. Come on. - Let me see.

628
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,759
-离那扇窗户远点。-等一下。
- Stay away from that window. - Wait a minute.

629
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:27,554
我跟着感觉走。我内心很害怕，我要对你负责。
I follow my feelings. I feel scared inside, and I'm responsible for you.

630
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,183
-相信我的感觉。-我们不要太紧张了。
- Trust my feelings. - Let's not get too jumpy about this.

631
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,769
如果他们是警察，我们早就被捕了。
If they're from the police, we'd be arrested already.

632
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:37,731
我知道有什么不对劲。我比你有更多的经验。
I know there's something wrong. I have more experience than you have.

633
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:43,654
-我们必须马上离开这里。-好吧，吉娜，随你便。
- We must get out of here and quick. - All right, Gina have it your way.

634
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,037
我们今晚在这里很安全。
Here we'll be safe for the night.

635
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:17,813
我认为这是安全的。然后明天天一亮，我们就搬走。
I think this is safe. Then tomorrow, as soon as it gets light, we'll move.

636
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:19,898
好吧。
All right.

637
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,249
作为一栋被监视的房子，我们很容易就逃了出来。
For a house that was being watched, we got out awfully easy.

638
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,918
我相信我的感觉。
I trust my feelings.

639
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,714
我颤抖。
I'm shaking.

640
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,924
我浑身发抖。
I'm shaking all over.

641
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:56,018
你会崩溃的，吉娜你每天都会崩溃一点。
Now you'll go to pieces, Gina every day you fall apart a little more.

642
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,064
太长了。太多了。
Too long. Too much.

643
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,233
太多的担心，太多的恐惧。
Too much worry and too much fright.

644
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,821
太多的死亡。
Too much death.

645
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:12,201
吉娜，你会没事的。
Gina, you're going to be all right.

646
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:14,286
别担心。
Don't worry.

647
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:20,667
我希望你喜欢我。
I want you to like me.

648
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:23,337
我想让你嫉妒我。
I want you to be jealous over me.

649
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:30,594
我想让你以为我是一个从没被吻过的穿白裙子的女孩。
I want you to think I'm a girl in a white dress... Who has never been kissed before.

650
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,003
广告上登了。
It's in. The advertisement.

651
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,466
——在哪里?——在这里。
- Where? - Here.

652
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,052
“莱amadi中尉。”
"Lieutenant rinaldo amadi."

653
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,138
他们把波尔达的女儿救出来了。
They've got polda's daughter out.

654
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,765
现在我们必须去罗摩里餐厅。
Now we must go to romoli's.

655
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:20,227
-噩梦结束了，宝贝。-另一个开始，把polda弄出来。
- Nightmare's over, baby. - Another one starts, to get polda out.

656
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,565
——我们将管理。你给我买剃须刀了吗?——是的。
- We'll manage. Did you get me a razor? - Yes.

657
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:32,573
剃刀，刀片，还有……一块肥皂。
Razor, and a blade, and... a piece of soap.

658
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,951
谢谢。
Thanks.

659
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,333
不客气
You're welcome.

660
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:53,218
哎，在我们的工作中，你遇到一个男人或一个女人，一天或一个星期，然后再见。
Ai, in our work you meet a man or a woman, for a day or a week, then good-bye.

661
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:56,638
但有一天，我的心离我很近。
But in one day heart's come close.

662
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:04,396
也许在和平时期我甚至都不看你，说"愚蠢的美国游客"
Maybe in peacetime I don't even look at you, say, "silly American tourist."

663
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:12,196
但现在我告诉你，我很喜欢这个长长的美国人，我想让你知道。
But now I tell you, I like very much this long American, and I want you to know.

664
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,616
为什么只有“喜欢”，吉娜?
Why only "like," Gina?

665
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,118
这样更好，更简单。
It's better. Easier.

666
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,913
为什么?
Why?

667
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:25,042
有时候它是更好的。
Sometimes it's better.

668
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:31,089
哎哟!你得刮胡子了，快点儿。
Ouch! You must shave, and hurry.

669
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,383
我们得去罗摩利餐厅
We've got to go to romoli's

670
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:04,016
把你的外套给我。
Give me your coat.

671
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,934
把这个。
Take this.

672
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,882
从门口进去。
Get into that doorway.

673
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,063
吉娜,polda !
Gina, get polda!

674
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:45,403
听着，这就像杀死一条疯狗。
Look, it's just like killing a mad dog.

675
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:49,241
除了狗，你可以感到抱歉。他生病不是他的错。
Except for the dog you can feel sorry. It's not his fault he is sick.

676
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:25,610
Jesper医生，Jesper医生，什么事?
Dr.jesper - Dr. Jesper - yes?

677
01:29:25,652 --> 01:29:28,363
我想你最好开车。
I think you'd better drive.

678
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:30,740
哦，没什么严重的。
Oh, it's nothing serious.

679
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,952
我这个年纪有点太兴奋了。
Just a little too much excitement at my age.

680
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:38,498
我一见到玛丽亚就会好的。
I'll be again all right as soon as I've seen Maria.

681
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:41,084
好吧。拐弯处停车。
All right. Stop around the bend.

682
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:22,626
Jesper
Jesper

683
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,594
这是我第一次听到你的名字。
That's the first time I heard your name.

684
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:42,812
Jesper，我喜欢。
Jesper I like it.

685
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,096
谢谢你！
Thank you.

686
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,314
小指中尉愿为您效劳。
Lieutenant pinkie at your service.

687
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,566
——小手指。-请进，伙计们。
- Pinkie. - Come on in, folks.

688
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:32,529
没关系。小指。
It's okay. It's pinkie.

689
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:36,533
——嗨,ai。——小手指。
- Hi, ai. - Pinkie.

690
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:39,160
-认识一下波尔达教授。-你好，波达教授?
- Meet professor polda. - How do you do, professor polda?

691
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,496
-你好。-你从哪弄来的?
- How do you do. - Where'd you get that stuff?

692
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:44,958
哦,这个吗?我的旅行服装。
Oh, this? My traveling costume.

693
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,085
挺合身的，不是吗?
Kind of a nice fit, isn't it?

694
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,212
哦,pinaro见面。
Oh, meet pinaro.

695
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:53,508
伟大的老家伙。如果他穿着制服，他会有满满一箱水果沙拉。
Great old guy. If he were in uniform he'd have a chest full of fruit salad.

696
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:57,470
——Pinaro。——Benvenuti。
- Pinaro. - Benvenuti.

697
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,514
让我们进去。
Let's go in.

698
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,602
-这位是彼得罗-祝你好运，彼得罗。
- And, uh, this is Pietro. - Buona sera, Pietro.

699
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,610
——marsoli在哪?-他马上就来。
- Where's marsoli? - He'll be along any minute.

700
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:14,779
和波达小姐。
And with signorina polda.

701
01:32:14,821 --> 01:32:17,657
-她安全吗?——绝对安全。
- Is she safe? - Perfectly safe.

702
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,326
很高兴她能再见到你。
And very happy she's going to see you again.

703
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:24,372
-遇到麻烦了吗?-整个行动都很顺利。
- Run into any trouble? - Not a hitch in the whole operation.

704
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:28,084
像一阵风。我们通过酒店里的一个小女孩解决的。
Went like a breeze. We worked it through a little girl in the hotel.

705
01:32:28,168 --> 01:32:32,547
漂亮的孩子。一开始有点害怕，但我打动了她善良的本性。
Nice kid. A little scared at first, but I appealed to her better nature.

706
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:40,597
我们的秘鲁朋友整理了一些文件，这样就可以坐火车旅行了。——谢谢。
Our perugian friends fixed up some papers - that made it okay to travel by train. - Thank you.

707
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,974
今天下午我们在最近的城镇下了车。
This afternoon we got off at the nearest town.

708
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:45,560
我想其他人会让天黑后这里更容易。
I figured the others would make it easier here after dark.

709
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:49,647
所以我走在前面，检查了一下我们预定的行程。
So I came on ahead and checked on our reservations for the trip out.

710
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:52,400
——哦,pinaro。-我们在哪里和飞机会合?
- Oh, pinaro. - Where do we meet the plane?

711
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,736
在离这里四英里的田地里。
In a field about four miles from here.

712
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,363
谢谢。吉娜知道。
Grazie. Gina knows where.

713
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,700
我可以开车去吗?——几乎。不会花很长时间的。
- Can I go all the way by car? - Almost. It won't take long.

714
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:17,342
从科西嘉岛。飞机将在凌晨4点降落。
It's from corsica. The plane will land at 4:00 am.

715
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,891
他们会派什么样的飞机?有多大?
What sort of plane will they send? How big?

716
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:28,019
他们知道我们有四个人。
They know there are four of us going out.

717
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:43,576
我知道我应该希望他们快点来，这样一切就都结束了，但我能想到的是，一个小时后我们就要告别了。
I know I should be wishing they'd come quickly and it'll all be over, but all I can think of is, in one hour we'll say good-bye.

718
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:46,913
吉娜，飞机上还有空位。
Gina, there's room on the plane.

719
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:52,377
这里的人太少了，即使是一个逃跑的人，也会被严重怀念。
There's so few of us here, even one who runs away is badly missed.

720
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:55,713
你知道的。你不?
You know that. Don't you?

721
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,553
是的，我知道。
Yes, I know that.

722
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,538
未婚女子polda。
Signorina polda.

723
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,430
Benvenufi。
Benvenufi.

724
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,434
-来吧，小指?祈祷,祝福。
- Come va, pinkie? - Bene, bene.

725
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:55,690
女士们，女士们，我是波尔达女士
Signori e signora, ia signorina polda

726
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:10,371
但那不是玛丽亚!
But that's, that's not Maria!

727
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:14,500
——什么?-那不是玛丽亚!
- What? - That is not Maria!

728
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:17,545
她在哪里呢?我女儿呢?
Where is she? Where is my daughter?

729
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:19,589
在佩鲁贾公墓。
In the perugia cemetery.

730
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,758
她六个月前去世了。
She died six months ago.

731
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:26,554
不。不,那是不可能的。
No. No, that's impossible.

732
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,598
她一直给我写信。
She's been writing me steadily.

733
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,518
这笔迹很难模仿。
The handwriting is so hard to imitate.

734
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,364
德国人!
Germans!

735
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:02,548
这是没有用的。你被德国人包围了。
It is no use. You're surrounded by Germans.

736
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,718
扔掉你们的枪，举起手走出去。
Throw away your guns and march out with your hands up.

737
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:08,221
投降。这是你唯一的机会。
Surrender. It's your only chance.

738
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:14,894
下来!
Get down!

739
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,307
看来他们要慢慢来了。
Looks like they're gonna take their time about it.

740
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:53,641
他们可以负担得起。
They can afford to.

741
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,769
天亮的时候，他们可能会有一整团德国佬在外面。
They'll probably have a whole kraut regiment out there by daylight.

742
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:02,150
有时候一个人带球，有时候另一个人。
Ai, sometimes one guy carries the ball, sometimes another.

743
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:05,486
从地下室出去有条路。
There's a way out of here through the cellar.

744
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:10,408
-抓住老人和吉娜，快走。-我做不到，小指。
- Grab the old man and Gina and beat it. - I can't do it, pinkie.

745
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,832
现在别对我手软。没有时间。
Don't go soft on me now. There isn't time.

746
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:20,752
一小时后就天亮了，那架飞机等不及了。
It'll be light in an hour, and that plane can't wait.

747
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:28,718
-为什么我们不一起试试呢?-你能成功的唯一办法，就是我们开枪让他们相信我们还在这里。
- Why don't we all try it together? - The only way you can make it, is if we do enough shooting to convince them we're all still here.

748
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,720
-快走吧!——不,小手指。
- Now get going! - No, pinkie.

749
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:33,765
我的命令是带你进入这个国家，然后把你弄出来。
My orders were to get you into this country and get you out.

750
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,725
在这种时候不要对我手软!
Don't go soft on me at a time like this!

751
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:39,854
吉娜，把他从活板门弄出去。这是命令，你也是
Gina, get him out through the trapdoor. That's an order. For you too, ai

752
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,575
快!快!
Quick! Quick!

753
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:48,714
光了!
Light out!

754
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:27,021
Jespeh
Jespeh

755
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,025
吉娜!
Gina!

756
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:23,846
我只能给他们五分钟。
I can only give them five minutes.

757
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,782
他们来了!
There they come!

758
