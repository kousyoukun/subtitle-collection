1
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:01,374
Ivan,

2
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,314
Unh!

3
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:07,199
Spasibo.

4
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,242
Mein herr! Ach!

5
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,418
Aah!

6
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,367
Whoa-oh!

7
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,304
Jack Flack escapes.

8
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:52,839
How could
he escape?

9
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,374
Look at
the dice.

10
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,276
So what?

11
00:04:56,476 --> 00:05:00,413
24. Jack's agility
is 24. He escapes.

12
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:01,814
That's not fair.

13
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:04,817
I got killed, and you
should have been dead.

14
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:07,953
I'm not. Jack Flack
always escapes.

15
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:09,322
Dumb game.

16
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:12,425
You just got to develop
better moves, Kim, that's all.

17
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,459
You're getting there.

18
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:16,779
I don't believe this.
How can he do it, Morris?

19
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,899
I had 10 times as many
bullets as Jack Flack.

20
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,835
Yeah, but Flack had the
ingenuity and the contacts, Kim.

21
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,770
It's better than
bullets sometimes.

22
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,738
Hey, don't feel bad.

23
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:26,972
I haven't been able
to beat him all summer.

24
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,540
What happens next,
Morris?

25
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,909
Let's leave it
for now.

26
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:31,944
I want to think of
something really good

27
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:32,845
to get you with.

28
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,381
Anyway, I want to
get back to my game.

29
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:36,716
Don't look at me.

30
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,518
I'm sick of
getting killed.

31
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:39,652
We could trade.

32
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:42,555
I'll give you extra gas masks
and a bulletproof vest.

33
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:43,356
No way.

34
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,525
You never get hurt.
It's no fun.

35
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,695
Jack Flack always
escapes anyway.

36
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:03,159
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

37
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,445
Hey, guys, be careful
with those.

38
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,579
I just got them in.

39
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:09,882
This is Jack Flack
requesting an assignment.

40
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:10,716
Over.

41
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,885
* Hello
everybody.

42
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:13,719
Ha ha ha!

43
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,655
Come on, Kim,
be serious.

44
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,557
You guys want
a real assignment?

45
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:18,724
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,893
You got
your bus passes?

47
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:23,879
Ok, I want you to
go over to Textronics.

48
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,866
Pick me up some catalogues
for the new 4200.

49
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on, Morris.

50
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,201
Give us
something exciting,

51
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,537
like Cloak and Dagger,

52
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:33,138
only for real.

53
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:35,140
Ok.

54
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:45,885
I want you to infiltrate
their seventh level.

55
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:46,752
Mm-hmm.

56
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,987
Then go to their
vending machine.

57
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:51,223
Pick me up
a pack of Twinkies.

58
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:52,024
Ohh...

59
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,894
There's a secret
message inside.

60
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:55,695
Hmm.

61
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:56,896
Whatever you do,

62
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,900
don't let anybody
see you. Anybody.

63
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,901
You coming?

64
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:03,135
Not if you're gonna be
embarrassing.

65
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,004
I won't.

66
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,357
Let's see.

67
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:10,710
Grenade...

68
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,178
gun...

69
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:16,181
ammo.

70
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:19,285
Ok.

71
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:20,986
Now what
are you doing?

72
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:25,858
Jack Flack says to always
keep your gun loaded.

73
00:07:26,058 --> 00:07:28,527
Morris, could we try
these out?

74
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:31,196
Yeah. Just
don't break 'em.

75
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,602
Time to go, Jack.

76
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:41,974
See you, Morris.

77
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:09,101
Oh, great.

78
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:14,239
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

79
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,341
Yeah, what?

80
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,310
Come on, Kim.
Play right.

81
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,112
All right.

82
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:21,547
Lady Ace
to Jack Flack.

83
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,015
Do you read me?

84
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,283
Loud and clear.

85
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:27,252
Prepare to penetrate
the enemy stronghold.

86
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:28,454
Follow me in.

87
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:32,057
This is what I meant
by "embarrassing."

88
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:04,556
Hey!

89
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:21,907
You proceed to floor 7
for Operation Catalog.

90
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:24,677
I'll get the secret
from the machine.

91
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,479
Wait a minute.

92
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,380
I think that sentry
spotted us.

93
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,115
Davey, put that away.

94
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:31,533
Hi, kids.

95
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:32,752
You lost?

96
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:34,720
If you tell me
who you're looking for,

97
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,855
maybe I can help.

98
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,857
We're looking
for Textronics.

99
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:41,093
Ah. You're looking
for the Game Division?

100
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:42,194
Seventh floor.

101
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,964
Thank you,
Officer.

102
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:54,974
We'll take
separate routes

103
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,776
just in case one of us
is neutralized.

104
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,978
I'll take the fire stairs,
you take the elevator.

105
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:03,015
Good, 'cause I'm
not walking up.

106
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,806
Pardon me.

107
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,944
What's
the matter now?

108
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:35,447
That guy had a gun, Kim,
and it was a real gun.

109
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,117
Oh, Davey, will
you stop it?

110
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,251
Honest!
I saw a gun!

111
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,854
You're really
being a jerk.

112
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:49,294
Well, here. Take this
grenade just in case.

113
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,263
Thanks, anyway.

114
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,126
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

115
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,978
Yeah, Davey,
what is it?

116
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:24,521
I'm almost
in position.

117
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,865
Give me
your location.

118
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:29,001
I'm already up here,
and I'm waiting for you.

119
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,619
Textronics.
Mr. Rice's office.

120
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:32,212
Ok. Start creating
a diversion.

121
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:33,806
I'll sneak out
the fire stairs

122
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:34,674
and hit the machine.

123
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:38,444
* Davey, this
is embarrassing *

124
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:42,214
Maintain radio silence
from now on.

125
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,349
Over and out.

126
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,689
Don't let him
leave the building.

127
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:52,291
Rice...
moving to the elevator.

128
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,292
Intercepting fully.

129
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:56,128
Hello?

130
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:59,047
Will there be
anything else today?

131
00:11:59,247 --> 00:12:01,767
Ah, do you have
a food machine here?

132
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:04,169
Lady Ace,
Lady Ace, come in.

133
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,539
Excuse me.

134
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,075
Textronics.

135
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,711
Mr. Rice is
in a meeting.

136
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,479
I thought we were
maintaining radio silence.

137
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,080
Did you hear them?

138
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,951
No. I'm busy.
Now stop bugging me.

139
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,222
Uh, the vending machines
are right over there.

140
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,331
So your friend cut off
radio contact, did she?

141
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:33,933
Oh. Hi, Jack.

142
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,051
Well, some people
just don't know

143
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:38,170
how to act on
a secret mission.

144
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,339
I guess we're better off

145
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,141
just handling this one
on our own.

146
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,009
Like the Maracaibo assignment.
Remember that?

147
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,212
Back when I was known
as Agent X.

148
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,848
That was
a close one.

149
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,015
Yeah...

150
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:51,350
Yeah. There we were,

151
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,052
surrounded by hordes
of angry mercenaries.

152
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,287
All you had was
a ball of string

153
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:57,172
and a sealed I.O.U.
from the embassy.

154
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:58,858
And then there was
a letter bomb.

155
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,460
Yeah, that's 'cause
I told you not to trust them.

156
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,229
That's what I mean
about working alone.

157
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,131
I guess
you're right.

158
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:07,933
Yeah...

159
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,297
Help...me.

160
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,002
Here. Here...

161
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,375
Whatever happens,

162
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:25,277
don't let them get it.

163
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:28,697
Tell the FBI...

164
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:32,117
1 million, 329...

165
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,287
Run!

166
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,294
Aah!

167
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:57,476
Davey, what
are you doing?

168
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,178
They just killed a man,
now they're after me!

169
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,663
I got Morris'
Twinkie...

170
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:04,149
Help, police!
Murder!

171
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,052
What's the
problem, kid?

172
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,054
There's 2 men,
they're trying to kill me.

173
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:10,022
What men?

174
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,024
They're up there!
They just killed a man!

175
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:14,426
Call the police!

176
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,064
He was right here!
I saw him fall!

177
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:21,967
I had to run
right by him!

178
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,669
You want to tell me
what is this all about?

179
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,372
Well, these Nazis, or
some kind of bad guys,

180
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:28,407
they shot
this FBI man.

181
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:29,975
Nazis?

182
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,277
How should I know?
Maybe they were Russians,

183
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,145
but they shot him,

184
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,481
and he was bleeding,
and he fell.

185
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,517
I knew he was dead.

186
00:15:38,717 --> 00:15:40,452
Look,
I'm not kidding you!

187
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:41,420
I can prove it.

188
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,455
He gave me this
secret cartridge...

189
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:44,323
No, no, no.

190
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,191
Don't trust him, Dave.

191
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:48,660
That's the first rule
of espionage.

192
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,130
Always stay true
to your source.

193
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:56,168
Secret what?

194
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,169
Well?

195
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:00,439
Never mind.

196
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:04,243
Hi, Mr. Rice.
Hi, Purdy.

197
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,478
Did you see anybody
on the terrace level?

198
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,013
No, not a soul.

199
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:08,881
Hi.

200
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,616
We better hold him
for the police.

201
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:14,386
We better go talk
to the police.

202
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,421
Come on.

203
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,426
Ok, folks,
step back.

204
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:22,327
Clear the area.

205
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,429
Thank you.

206
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,682
I better be
going now.

207
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,058
You gonna be
all right?

208
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:03,435
Yeah. I've got a key.

209
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:04,736
Ok.

210
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:21,453
Davey, I've been calling
all over the place for you.

211
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:22,354
Mr. Osborne,

212
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,190
Lieutenant Fleming,
San Antonio PD.

213
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,091
Dad, I didn't do...

214
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,626
Just wait a minute,
ok? Let him talk.

215
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:28,910
What's...come on in.

216
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,995
Not at this time.

217
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:32,097
I've got to keep an ear
out for the squawk box.

218
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,116
Oh. Well, go on
to your room, Davey.

219
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:36,827
Dad, I want to hear
what he has to say...

220
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:39,538
Just go to your room,
Davey, all right?

221
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:43,442
What, uh...

222
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:44,609
What...what
happened?

223
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,494
Well, your son
created quite a stir

224
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:48,380
at the Tower Life
Building this morning

225
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,781
when he reported
a murder.

226
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,983
A murder?

227
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:53,168
That's right, sir.
We checked out his story

228
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:55,354
and found absolutely
no credence to it.

229
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:56,321
Then we tried
to bring him home,

230
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,940
but he refused to
divulge the whereabouts

231
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,560
of what he called,
um, "Headquarters."

232
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,628
Sorry, Officer,
but he does, uh,

233
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:04,964
do that sometimes.

234
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,366
We got them right
where we want them.

235
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:08,533
Huh?

236
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,134
Let 'em think
you're nuts.

237
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:11,686
See, if we're
gonna be heroes,

238
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:13,038
we got to keep
a low profile.

239
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,707
No cops, no dads,
we're on our own, pal.

240
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:18,377
There gonna be any
charges, or what?

241
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:19,511
Not this time, sir,

242
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,247
but we do think that
you ought to consider

243
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,348
getting him some help.

244
00:18:23,548 --> 00:18:24,416
I have.

245
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,384
For almost an hour,
all he would give us

246
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,036
is his name, rank,
and serial number.

247
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:29,688
The tougher we got,
the tougher he got.

248
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:30,589
Good.

249
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,474
If it hadn't been
for the little girl,

250
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,359
we would've never
gotten him home.

251
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,160
Officer, I...

252
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,162
They'll sing
a different tune

253
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:38,130
once you're a hero.

254
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,232
...stuff like this
with parents a lot.

255
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,234
He is a good boy.

256
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:45,004
He's just...

257
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,306
going through a real
tough time right now.

258
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:48,473
He lost his
mother recently.

259
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:49,708
Oh.

260
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,244
I guess we're both
having a little difficulty

261
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:53,712
making an adjustment.

262
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:57,216
Well, I can say
one thing for him.

263
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,350
If we were at war,

264
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,552
I'd want him
on my side.

265
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:39,358
You ready to talk?

266
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,303
Want to talk
about the murders?

267
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:53,605
They weren't murderers.
They were spies.

268
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,707
They'd gone there to
kill an FBI agent.

269
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:59,944
I just intercepted one
of their communications.

270
00:20:00,144 --> 00:20:01,780
Anybody else see 'em?

271
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,818
If mom were here,
she'd believe me.

272
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,072
She probably would.

273
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:13,758
But she's not here,

274
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,360
and she's not
gonna be here.

275
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,963
We've gotta get
used to that.

276
00:20:19,163 --> 00:20:20,264
I miss her.

277
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,566
I know.

278
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,539
We both miss her.

279
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:31,676
I bet she knows it.

280
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:35,447
I'll bet she can see us
right now, you know that?

281
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:41,586
Listen,
I've got an idea.

282
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:43,722
Why don't you and me

283
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,391
call up Dr. Sullivan
tomorrow?

284
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:49,511
You just tell him
what you saw today.

285
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:52,631
Just...just to see what
he says about it.

286
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,733
Jack Flack was right.

287
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,635
You do think I'm crazy.

288
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,069
You still talking
to Jack Flack?

289
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,407
Sometimes.

290
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:08,313
Davey, you've
got to understand:

291
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:09,714
Jack Flack
is make-believe,

292
00:21:09,914 --> 00:21:11,883
just like all these
ridiculous games.

293
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,052
They don't make it
any easier for you

294
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:16,821
to get a grasp
on things.

295
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,591
Want to see something?

296
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:20,792
See proof?

297
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,161
Let me show you.

298
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,497
This is what
the FBI man gave me.

299
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:31,170
Hey, come here.

300
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,438
There's something
coming on.

301
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:39,411
More Cloak and Dagger?

302
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:41,580
What did I just get
through telling you...

303
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,248
Dad,
this is important.

304
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,816
Just wait a minute.
You'll see.

305
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:46,418
Oh, Davey...

306
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,253
Just give me
a chance.

307
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:50,438
A man was just
killed for this.

308
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,424
Do you want me
to play it once?

309
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:55,560
All right, play it.
Play it one time.

310
00:21:58,863 --> 00:22:00,798
See, that's Dr. Boom
and that's Jack Flack

311
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,934
going to the secret
underground bomb factory.

312
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,770
Have you seen this
or done this before?

313
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,939
Yeah. I played it
at Morris'.

314
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:11,759
Now, here we are.

315
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,645
Get the guards.

316
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,948
Got one!

317
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,750
Ok, get the case...

318
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,087
I'd like to figure
this one out.

319
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:26,758
And I made it.

320
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,494
And where's the proof
you're talking about?

321
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:30,295
I don't know.

322
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,897
Maybe it's on
the next level.

323
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:47,512
Now let's shut it off,
all right? Come on.

324
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:48,447
But I get another life.

325
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,449
Let's just shut it
off. That's enough...

326
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:51,250
Dad!

327
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,685
I want you to
get ready for bed.

328
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:54,986
Can I just play
one more?

329
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,789
Davey, I said no
and I mean no.

330
00:22:57,989 --> 00:22:59,758
Now,
get ready for bed.

331
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,628
I hate you.

332
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,570
I know you don't
mean that, son.

333
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,872
You don't
care about me.

334
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,024
Huh! You never
believe me.

335
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,934
Davey,
when I was a kid,

336
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,844
I was exactly
like you are.

337
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:21,313
I wanted to be a hero.

338
00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,081
That's why
I joined the Air Force.

339
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,749
So I could
be somebody.

340
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:28,319
Let me tell you
something, Davey.

341
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:31,138
Heroes don't
just shoot bad guys,

342
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:33,758
they...they put
supper on the table,

343
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:38,096
they fix bicycles,
they do boring things...

344
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:40,031
real things,
not make believe.

345
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:42,550
I hope
you'll understand that

346
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,069
when you get
a little bit older.

347
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,008
Now, I'm going to
put these games away.

348
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:53,745
I don't want you
playing 'em anymore.

349
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:58,950
Dad, if you'd just play
one with me sometime.

350
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,554
Good night, Davey.

351
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:12,631
Not too smart for
a military man, huh?

352
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,048
Shut up.

353
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:15,466
Unh!

354
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,976
Will you get that
for me, Davey?

355
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:28,747
Hello?

356
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:34,853
Is this
David G. Osborne?

357
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,705
Yes.

358
00:24:36,905 --> 00:24:38,357
Good.

359
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:40,692
Dad!
Yeah?

360
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:42,760
It's them!
It's the spies.

361
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,829
The ones
who killed the man!

362
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,350
Hurry!

363
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,102
Hello.

364
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,222
They hung up.

365
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:56,341
What'd he say?

366
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,344
Just asked
who I was.

367
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,845
Dad, they know
where I am.

368
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,046
Ah, it's just a wrong number.
Come on, let's...

369
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:02,914
No, it wasn't!

370
00:25:03,114 --> 00:25:05,083
I know
it was them.

371
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:06,518
Come on, come on,
take it easy.

372
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:09,621
Just go on to bed.
It's way past your bedtime.

373
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,193
Can I sleep
in your bed tonight?

374
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:16,995
What?

375
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:19,798
Can I sleep in
your bed tonight?

376
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,800
What for?

377
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:26,705
Well, I don't think
those, uh,

378
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,307
guys will come in
when you're here.

379
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:31,710
You don't, eh?

380
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:34,713
Ok, come on.

381
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:38,950
Everything's
going to be ok, son.

382
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,582
Dad!

383
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:15,519
What is it, son?

384
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,121
Don't leave.

385
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,323
Well, I've got
to go to work, son.

386
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:20,792
I don't have
any choice.

387
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:23,762
Well, they're just
waiting for you to leave

388
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,697
so they can get me.

389
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:27,932
Yeah...

390
00:26:28,132 --> 00:26:29,801
Listen, I, um...

391
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:31,970
I talked to Dr. Sullivan
this morning,

392
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,071
and I made
an appointment

393
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:35,006
for us to see him
tomorrow, ok?

394
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:35,907
Humor him, Davey.

395
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:38,777
This turkey's
not gonna help us.

396
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,094
We're on our own.

397
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:41,212
And I got to...

398
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:42,780
I got to work
a double shift today

399
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,148
on account of
that big inspection

400
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,200
I told you about,
but tomorrow I'm off

401
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,252
so I can go to
the doctor with you,

402
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:48,987
and you can tell him...

403
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:52,423
everything you told me
about those spies.

404
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:54,993
Can't I
go with you?

405
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:55,894
Davey...

406
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,829
Come on,
you're a big boy now.

407
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,831
I mean, you're old enough
to stay home alone

408
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,266
without kicking
a fuss, aren't you?

409
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:03,668
I'll tell you what:

410
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,805
Maybe next week we can get
you in that baseball camp.

411
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,239
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

412
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,241
Huh?

413
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:12,243
Ok.

414
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:17,648
If you need me, just call me
at the base, ok?

415
00:27:37,001 --> 00:27:41,372
Lady Ace, Lady Ace,
come in.

416
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:44,242
Kim, are you there?

417
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:45,826
Kim, come in.

418
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:47,211
Yeah, what?

419
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,748
Listen, we got an
assignment for today.

420
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,250
I don't want any more of
your stupid assignments.

421
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,302
Come on, Kim, I'm
really in trouble.

422
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:56,354
Good. You got me
in trouble yesterday.

423
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:57,722
Now what?

424
00:27:57,922 --> 00:27:59,323
Remember the spies?

425
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,725
You mean the killers?

426
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,126
Uh, yeah. They're
coming to kill me.

427
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:04,295
They want the Cloak
and Dagger thing back.

428
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:05,564
I need you to come over.

429
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:07,632
What Cloak
and Dagger thing?

430
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,350
Can't tell you now.
It's top secret.

431
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,069
Tell him you're having
your breakfast

432
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,653
and you'll call
him back later.

433
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:14,238
My mom says
I got to go now.

434
00:28:14,438 --> 00:28:15,106
Wait.

435
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:19,944
I'm having my breakfast.
I'll call you back later.

436
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:22,246
Is he
always like that?

437
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:23,748
Usually.

438
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:25,750
Doesn't it
drive you crazy?

439
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,252
Nah. He's the only boy
in the neighborhood

440
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:30,722
who isn't boring.

441
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:33,758
Did I
teach you that?

442
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,910
Well, what's
his father like?

443
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,062
Forget it.
He's not your type.

444
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:39,097
Wait a minute.

445
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:40,681
How on earth
would you know

446
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,066
who is or isn't
my type?

447
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,069
He's in the Army
or something.

448
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,638
Oh.

449
00:28:46,838 --> 00:28:48,856
Guess you're right.

450
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,075
We are on our own.

451
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:47,932
I'll get it.

452
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:08,152
There's gotta be
something on this tape.

453
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,021
Probably encoded.

454
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:11,690
So what do we do?

455
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,157
Have it decoded, take it to
the FBI, and we'll be heroes.

456
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:15,126
How do we do that?

457
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,761
A good spy always knows

458
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,880
when to bring in
outside expertise.

459
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,999
Morris can do it.
He can do anything.

460
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,100
Don't tell him
too much.

461
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,168
Just enough
to get the job done.

462
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:27,138
We can trust Morris.

463
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:28,106
He's my friend.

464
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:31,109
Friendship is a luxury
a spy can't afford.

465
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,077
What do you mean?

466
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:37,048
Well, ok, if you
really think so.

467
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,550
Morris.

468
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,435
Thank you.

469
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:43,121
Morris.

470
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:46,357
Where's my Twinkies?

471
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,191
Guess what.

472
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:48,993
What, you made it
to the 17th level

473
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:49,961
of Cloak and Dagger?

474
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:52,230
No, Morris,
this is for real.

475
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:56,267
I got this real important tape
I wanted you to see.

476
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,335
Oh, yeah?

477
00:30:57,535 --> 00:30:59,637
Yeah, it has some secret code
or something in it.

478
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:02,874
Will you take
a look at it?

479
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:05,593
Morris, are you
listening to me?

480
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:07,953
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Davey, I want to

481
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:10,314
have the Twinkies
or my money back.

482
00:31:13,317 --> 00:31:14,652
What's this?

483
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:15,987
You tell me.

484
00:31:16,187 --> 00:31:19,524
Looks like a Cloak
and Dagger tape.

485
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:23,061
Well, it's not.
Take a look at it.

486
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,329
What do you mean,
it's not?

487
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:28,332
Who gave it to you?

488
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:29,467
This guy.

489
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,236
I can't tell you
any more than that.

490
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:33,104
Hmm.

491
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:34,438
Top secret, huh?

492
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:37,175
What do you
want me to do?

493
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,309
I don't know, Morris.

494
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:41,312
You're the genius
around here.

495
00:31:41,512 --> 00:31:44,315
All right.
Let's have a look.

496
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,992
This microchip
doesn't belong here.

497
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:54,793
What?

498
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,127
Take a look.

499
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:57,328
Whoever put this in

500
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,430
really knew what
he was doing.

501
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,332
Look at those
connections.

502
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:03,367
It could be used to
store information.

503
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:04,235
Input, output...

504
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:07,305
What kind of information?
Government plans, maybe?

505
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,440
It could be
anything really.

506
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,042
Tell you one thing,
whoever put this in

507
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:14,645
really went through
a lot of trouble.

508
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:18,282
Think you can
break the code?

509
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:21,119
The key is
how to get to it.

510
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,087
I've got an idea.

511
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:28,993
The guy who gave it to me said
something about some numbers.

512
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:30,761
What numbers?

513
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:32,980
1 million...

514
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,757
329...something.

515
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:36,334
I bet you anything

516
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:39,037
that's the secret code
that we're looking for.

517
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,204
Can you think
of anything else?

518
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:42,140
No.

519
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,642
Davey,
are you alone?

520
00:32:46,677 --> 00:32:47,345
That reminds me,
Davey,

521
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,180
I want to get those
walkie-talkies back.

522
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,016
Sure, Morris.

523
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,328
Flack to Lady Ace.
Come in, Lady Ace.

524
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:05,129
I'm here.

525
00:33:05,329 --> 00:33:06,797
Kim, where are you?

526
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,032
Your house.

527
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:09,767
Get out of there!

528
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,502
The spies are there!

529
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:16,140
Kim?

530
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,225
Seems we each
have something

531
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:20,311
the other wants,
don't we, kid?

532
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:21,312
Yeah.

533
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,864
We might consider a trade.
How's that sound?

534
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:26,417
Just leave her alone.
She doesn't know anything.

535
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:27,118
She does now.

536
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:30,788
Do you know the
Japanese sunken gardens?

537
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:32,006
Yeah.

538
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,024
Good.

539
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:34,559
We'll meet you
there at noon.

540
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,894
If you tell anybody
about this,

541
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:39,230
we'll break your
little friend in half.

542
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:48,606
Don't give it
to 'em, Davey.

543
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:52,576
Rule number 2: Never, never
play by the enemy's rules.

544
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:55,113
I have to give
them something.

545
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,068
I couldn't
take that.

546
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:03,187
We do it
all the time.

547
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:04,188
It's called, um...

548
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:07,325
commandeering necessary
mission equipment.

549
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:37,248
Stop right there.

550
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,255
Cut the crap, kid.
Give me the tape.

551
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:50,528
Come any closer and you're
gonna be diving for it.

552
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,702
Now, are we
gonna make a trade

553
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:02,440
or are we gonna start
dropping things?

554
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:05,643
Davey!

555
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,609
Why do you want it
so bad?

556
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:22,760
It's just a kid's game.

557
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,828
Well, let's just say
I'm a kid at heart.

558
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,697
Why don't you
go buy your own?

559
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,199
They don't cost much.

560
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,900
Look, kid, don't
outsmart yourself.

561
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,635
I got
a couple of friends

562
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,171
and we play, too,
you know.

563
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,806
If I don't hand that
over to them by 5:30,

564
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,442
your little friend there
is gonna die.

565
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,245
All right,
just put it down,

566
00:36:41,445 --> 00:36:43,280
and I'll let her go.

567
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,316
You let Kim go first.

568
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,251
Sure.

569
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:49,420
Anything you say.

570
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,362
Your turn.

571
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:17,481
Freeze, turkey!

572
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,853
Take my advice.
Don't follow us.

573
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:24,955
Otherwise,
I'll have to use this.

574
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,690
Little punk!

575
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,292
Ah!

576
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,294
What?

577
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:32,430
Boy, am I glad
to see you!

578
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,465
Come on!

579
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:41,372
It's the wrong one!

580
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:53,016
Oh, what's going on?

581
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:06,430
Hurry up!
Let's get out of here!

582
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:14,738
Thank you.

583
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:17,775
Thank you.

584
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:25,916
Thanks, Davey.

585
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:27,251
What for?

586
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:28,586
You saved my life.

587
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:29,920
What were you doing
in my house anyway?

588
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,790
I thought
you weren't coming over.

589
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,359
I wasn't,
but then I felt bad

590
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,928
'cause I hurt
your feelings.

591
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:38,862
I was just mad

592
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:41,799
'cause you got me in
trouble yesterday,

593
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,301
and I thought
you were dumb

594
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,886
because of all
that murder stuff.

595
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,472
I never thought
it could be real.

596
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:49,607
Me, neither.

597
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,476
I'm really sorry,
Davey.

598
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,377
That's ok, Kim.

599
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:55,646
It's gonna be
all right.

600
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,684
Uh-oh!

601
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:02,686
I'm gonna get the tape now.

602
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:05,523
We have no further use for
the kid, do you understand?

603
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,791
Yes,
I understand.

604
00:39:12,663 --> 00:39:15,733
We've got to
get out of here.

605
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:16,867
I'll make 'em
follow me.

606
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:19,169
You get to Morris'
as quickly as you can,

607
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:20,271
and tell him
what's happened.

608
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,939
But they'll kill you
if they catch you.

609
00:39:22,139 --> 00:39:23,857
No, they won't.
I'm the only one

610
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:25,884
who knows where
the real tape is.

611
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:27,711
Sir, uh, I got
to get off here.

612
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:30,614
Sorry, junior. We're not
allowed to stop along here.

613
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:31,882
But it's an emergency.

614
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:36,086
It's only 3 blocks to the bus
station and everybody gets off.

615
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,755
But I feel sick...

616
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:38,589
What?

617
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:40,991
Yeah, like I'm
gonna throw...Ulp!

618
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,403
Run, Davey! Run!

619
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,382
Why is he
shooting at me?

620
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,751
He must've found out
where the cartridge is.

621
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:44,187
1 million,

622
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:45,839
329...

623
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,491
That's it.

624
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:50,528
I'll be right there!

625
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:52,463
The following material

626
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:56,550
is for A-4 security
clearance personnel only.

627
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,638
It is a federal crime
to view such material

628
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:02,039
without proper
authorization.

629
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,942
Bingo.

630
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:36,574
I said I'd be
right there.

631
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,123
Looking for
something?

632
00:41:53,323 --> 00:41:55,092
Someone's trying
to kill me.

633
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:55,893
Well, uh,

634
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,078
why don't you
kill them first?

635
00:41:58,278 --> 00:42:00,171
Don't encourage
him, Henry.

636
00:42:00,371 --> 00:42:02,069
Your food's
getting cold.

637
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,767
Would you
please go away?

638
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:07,204
Listen, I'm trying
to contact the FBI.

639
00:42:07,404 --> 00:42:09,873
Would you help me?

640
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:12,643
Get me a direct line
to J. Edgar Hoover.

641
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:14,161
This is an emergency.

642
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,479
Hoover's dead,
Henry.

643
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,280
Oh, my God,
they've gotten Hoover!

644
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,782
Now we're all goners!

645
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:21,284
Sorry, kid.
Can't help you.

646
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:47,811
Stand still, Davey.

647
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:49,396
They wouldn't dare
shoot at you

648
00:42:49,596 --> 00:42:51,339
with all these
people around here.

649
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,283
In fact, the more people,
the better.

650
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,785
Over there.

651
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,962
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

652
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:07,598
One child?

653
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:10,067
Uh...yes, ma'am.

654
00:43:10,267 --> 00:43:12,936
That'll be
50 cents.

655
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:14,304
Thank you.
Enjoy your ride.

656
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,139
Thanks.

657
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:18,075
One adult,
2 children.

658
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:25,882
There he is.

659
00:43:26,082 --> 00:43:27,751
Let's get him.

660
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:34,692
I'll get him.

661
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,894
No, just get
in line. Get in line.

662
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:41,131
Hey, buddy,
wait your turn.

663
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:49,556
I'll go get him
out of there.

664
00:43:49,756 --> 00:43:51,308
No, no, just
take it easy now.

665
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:53,110
Not now.

666
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:05,155
Tickets, please.

667
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:15,032
Thank you.

668
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:16,500
Your ticket, son.

669
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,968
Hey, here you go.

670
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:28,846
Sorry, sir.

671
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:31,414
All full. You'll have to
wait for the next boat.

672
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:32,650
We want this one.

673
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,669
I'm sorry, I can't take
any more passengers.

674
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:38,688
There'll be another boat
in 10 or 15 minutes.

675
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,708
Howard...Howard,

676
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:00,410
my wallet's gone!

677
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,912
Are you sure?

678
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:05,048
Of course I'm sure!

679
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:06,249
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

680
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:08,285
We'll go back over every
step we've been over

681
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:09,953
and see if we can
find it somewhere.

682
00:45:10,153 --> 00:45:10,954
Come on!

683
00:45:11,955 --> 00:45:13,390
Hurry!

684
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,465
Welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:24,034
My name is Hal.

686
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,003
Now, our tour through the
Downtown San Antonio River

687
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:29,006
shall take approximately
25 to 30 minutes.

688
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:30,808
Now, if you have
any questions

689
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:33,010
or anything you'd like to
ask me as we go along,

690
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,013
please do not hesitate
to do so.

691
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,816
I'm gonna get
close to the boy.

692
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:42,385
When I give you the signal,
create a diversion.

693
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:43,186
How?

694
00:45:43,386 --> 00:45:44,154
I don't care how,

695
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:48,058
just as long as people
aren't looking at me.

696
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,706
Sir, would you
kindly have a seat?

697
00:46:02,906 --> 00:46:05,075
You're supposed
to sit down.

698
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:06,810
Thank you.

699
00:46:34,037 --> 00:46:36,139
Ladies
and gentlemen,

700
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:37,908
I'd like to call
your attention

701
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:40,844
to the building coming up
here to the left-hand side

702
00:46:41,044 --> 00:46:43,647
which is the Ahmanson
River Theatre.

703
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:46,349
Parties and fiestas are held
there almost every day

704
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:47,617
during the summer months...

705
00:46:47,817 --> 00:46:48,785
George.

706
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,036
What?

707
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:51,088
Look.

708
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:54,391
Look at them.

709
00:46:57,861 --> 00:46:59,997
Sit down.

710
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,365
What's wrong, boy?

711
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:06,203
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you, ma'am.

712
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:08,105
Try me.

713
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,874
That man over there
is trying to kill me.

714
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:12,309
Huh?

715
00:47:13,376 --> 00:47:15,378
Sir, uh...

716
00:47:15,578 --> 00:47:17,881
please sit down.

717
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:18,982
Move!

718
00:47:19,182 --> 00:47:19,883
Huh? Why?

719
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:22,986
Because I said so.
Now move.

720
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:29,059
Don't be ridiculous.

721
00:47:29,259 --> 00:47:31,762
Looks like a pervert,
if you ask me.

722
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:33,163
George, we've got to
do something about this.

723
00:47:33,363 --> 00:47:34,197
What?

724
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:36,934
The building here
to my right-hand side

725
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:38,836
is the old
San Antonio Library

726
00:47:39,036 --> 00:47:41,772
which contains the Huntsberg
Circus Collection,

727
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:45,042
with 20,000 exhibits depicting
American circus life.

728
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:47,044
The building that you see
straight ahead

729
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:50,413
is the Power
and Light Building.

730
00:47:50,613 --> 00:47:51,214
Fire!
Where?

731
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:52,449
There!
In the engine!

732
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,303
Everybody back
to your seats, please,

733
00:48:13,503 --> 00:48:15,005
and don't panic!

734
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:18,341
Go back to your seats,
everybody, please.

735
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,377
Thank you.

736
00:48:22,412 --> 00:48:23,413
I'm sorry.

737
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:24,214
Sir.

738
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:25,815
Why don't you guys
sit down

739
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:27,417
and quit
rocking the boat?

740
00:48:27,617 --> 00:48:29,352
Yeah!
Sit down!

741
00:48:30,553 --> 00:48:32,322
It's for
your own safety.

742
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:33,824
Please sit down.

743
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:37,294
We'll continue
the tour.

744
00:49:00,183 --> 00:49:03,186
Morris!

745
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:15,999
Kim!

746
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,767
What happened
to you?

747
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,903
Nothing.
Where's Morris?

748
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:22,039
I don't know,
but look.

749
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:26,343
Davey,
do you think they...

750
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:29,279
No. Morris is
too smart for them.

751
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:30,347
We'll find him.

752
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:33,183
I think
he's already dead.

753
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:36,019
Shut up!
You don't know that!

754
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:39,322
I'm sorry.

755
00:49:39,522 --> 00:49:42,425
What do we do now?

756
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,328
No use calling my dad.

757
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:48,866
Why don't you call your mom
and tell her

758
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:53,203
Rice is going to do something
with the tape at 5:30?

759
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,338
Make her
call the police.

760
00:49:55,538 --> 00:49:56,806
Even if she
doesn't believe you,

761
00:49:57,006 --> 00:49:58,475
we need a grown-up.

762
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:02,145
Ok. What are you
going to do?

763
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:04,747
I'm going to try to
find Rice and stop him.

764
00:50:04,947 --> 00:50:06,383
How?

765
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:09,519
I don't know yet.

766
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,429
Well, you going to
stand here all day?

767
00:50:19,629 --> 00:50:20,597
I'm waiting
for the light

768
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:23,200
to change.
Come on.

769
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,303
They won't hit you if
you just keep moving.

770
00:50:31,441 --> 00:50:33,343
Crazy kid!

771
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:45,455
He said he had to be
somewhere at 5:30.

772
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:48,391
Means he'll probably
take his car.

773
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,727
There. "Textronics."

774
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:53,796
"Rice."

775
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,702
There's no place
to hide in there.

776
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,104
Open the trunk.

777
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:15,285
Oh.

778
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:21,524
What's the matter?

779
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:23,793
Oh. Tough.

780
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:29,466
It's now or never.
Come on.

781
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,600
In there?

782
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,569
Hurry up.
Hold it down.

783
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:35,772
Don't close it shut.
Just hold it down.

784
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,276
Oh! Jack?

785
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:15,245
Agent X, help.

786
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:17,114
Help me.
Get him off me.

787
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:20,750
Isn't it crowded enough
for you in here?

788
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:23,953
Oh.

789
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:25,522
Here.

790
00:52:25,722 --> 00:52:26,556
He was my friend.

791
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:29,226
How could they
do that to him?

792
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,594
I guess he just
wasn't good enough.

793
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:33,763
Yeah, but they didn't
have to kill him.

794
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:36,699
When you've been playing
this game as long as I have,

795
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:38,801
you get used to
this kind of thing.

796
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:44,241
We've stopped.

797
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:48,645
Better see where we are.

798
00:52:50,447 --> 00:52:51,248
What happens now?

799
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,316
We just wait
a couple minutes.

800
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:55,252
I'll walk over there
and make the drop.

801
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:57,187
So who gets
the game?

802
00:52:57,387 --> 00:52:58,688
I don't know, and I
don't want to know.

803
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:01,991
We just leave the case,
we wait a few minutes,

804
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:03,393
take the money.

805
00:53:03,593 --> 00:53:05,895
Only thing I know about
these people is one of them's

806
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,598
missing a couple fingers
from his right hand.

807
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:10,416
Well, remember
the Alamo, boys.

808
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:12,235
Sure as hell
don't tell you much.

809
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:14,471
Enough.

810
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,780
It's time to go.

811
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,617
Remember, you can win or lose
the game right here.

812
00:54:03,686 --> 00:54:06,238
...taxation
without representation.

813
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:08,791
In fact,
they were quite angry,

814
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:11,494
but they did not
want to fight Santa Ana.

815
00:54:11,694 --> 00:54:13,713
Instead they
tried to negotiate,

816
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:15,656
content being
citizens of Mexico.

817
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:17,612
All they wanted
was the reinstatement

818
00:54:17,812 --> 00:54:20,258
of the constitution
and taxes lifted.

819
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,705
In 1835,
negotiations broke down,

820
00:54:22,905 --> 00:54:25,157
and the Texans began
to talk revolution.

821
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:28,085
General Santa Ana
heard this rumor and...

822
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:31,013
The souvenir shop is
right through there.

823
00:54:31,213 --> 00:54:32,849
Thank you.

824
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:35,618
How much time do we have
before that tour bus leaves?

825
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:36,853
Oh, we've got time.

826
00:54:37,053 --> 00:54:39,055
Let's drop on
by the shop.

827
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:05,448
Well, look who's here.

828
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:06,316
Huh?

829
00:55:06,516 --> 00:55:09,786
Last time I saw you,
you were jumping off a boat.

830
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,054
Were you feeling
a little seasick?

831
00:55:12,254 --> 00:55:14,323
I'm hiding from
that man over there.

832
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:17,594
Oh, it's somebody
new this time.

833
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:20,197
Now, isn't it about time

834
00:55:20,397 --> 00:55:22,865
you told me
what this is all about?

835
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:28,205
Ladies and gentlemen,

836
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:32,409
the Alamo will be
closing in 2 minutes.

837
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,010
Our young friend
seems to be

838
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,612
in some sort
of trouble again.

839
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:38,615
Now, here,
just a minute.

840
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:41,718
What is your name?

841
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,186
Davey.

842
00:55:43,386 --> 00:55:46,856
Not Davy Crockett
by any chance?

843
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:51,261
I really have to
go now.

844
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:53,830
It's a matter of
national security.

845
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,600
Will everyone please exit
through the front door?

846
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:04,274
What do you think?

847
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:07,477
I think the boy
needs our help.

848
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:10,947
Hey, stop that kid!

849
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,716
He's stealing
somebody's bag! Get him!

850
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:16,419
You got
a hell of a nerve, kid,

851
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,187
stealing inside
the Alamo.

852
00:56:18,387 --> 00:56:19,222
I didn't steal it!

853
00:56:19,422 --> 00:56:20,790
He didn't steal
anything, Officer.

854
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:21,691
He took this.

855
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,360
Well, that's just
a simple mistake.

856
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,595
I sent the boy in to
pick up my camera case,

857
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,730
and he took
the wrong one.

858
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,766
Oh. Hey!

859
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,703
This yours?

860
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:36,473
Well, come and get it.

861
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:39,842
Why don't you take
the boy over to the car

862
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,844
while I straighten
this out?

863
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:42,845
But that one has

864
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:44,046
a secret
cartridge in it!

865
00:56:44,246 --> 00:56:45,648
Come on.

866
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:47,850
Don't worry
about it.

867
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:48,651
George will

868
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:50,653
take care of
everything.

869
00:56:50,853 --> 00:56:52,455
The car's
over here.

870
00:56:52,655 --> 00:56:54,391
Now, don't you
fret yourself.

871
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:55,625
George will take
care of everything.

872
00:56:55,825 --> 00:56:58,961
He's very good at that.

873
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:08,605
He's giving him
the camera case!

874
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:10,540
He is?

875
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,611
Well, if he did, he had
a reason for doing it.

876
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:23,286
Slide over.

877
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:25,154
That's it.

878
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,692
This what you're
so worried about?

879
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:30,593
No, sir.

880
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:32,712
It was the case
you gave the other man.

881
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:34,831
That was the one
with the plans in it.

882
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,037
What makes you
so sure

883
00:57:41,237 --> 00:57:43,806
I gave the wrong
case back?

884
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:44,441
Pardon?

885
00:57:44,641 --> 00:57:48,477
Why don't you open
it and find out?

886
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:53,015
You got it!

887
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:55,785
George always makes things
turn out right.

888
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:57,170
But how'd you do it?

889
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:58,355
I just gave that man

890
00:57:58,555 --> 00:58:00,239
my camera case
in its place.

891
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:02,124
He never noticed
the difference.

892
00:58:02,324 --> 00:58:03,492
Now, do you mind
telling us

893
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:04,661
what this
is all about?

894
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,096
After all, I sacrificed
my good camera

895
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:08,864
to save your
Cloak and Dagger tape.

896
00:58:09,064 --> 00:58:11,533
It isn't just
a Cloak and Dagger tape.

897
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:13,585
There's an extra
microchip in here.

898
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,638
What was that man
doing with it

899
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:17,474
at the Alamo?

900
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:20,810
Said he had to give it
to some foreign spy.

901
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:21,727
No!

902
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:22,445
Really?

903
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:25,648
Did he say what
the spy looked like?

904
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:28,851
Only that he had
2 fingers missing.

905
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,053
How exciting!

906
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:35,692
May I see the tape,
Davey?

907
00:58:35,892 --> 00:58:37,727
Sure.

908
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:44,667
Something wrong, Davey?

909
00:58:54,777 --> 00:58:55,612
It's all right.

910
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,647
Such a clever
little boy.

911
00:58:57,847 --> 00:58:59,482
Don't you think so,
George?

912
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:04,353
I wish we could take him
to Mexico City with us.

913
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:05,455
I made an arrangement
with Rice.

914
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:08,257
He's going to take care
of him for us

915
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:09,526
on our way
to the airport.

916
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:11,628
I don't like him, and I
don't like his methods,

917
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:14,163
and I don't like
those 2 thugs of his.

918
00:59:14,363 --> 00:59:16,098
I made it
very clear to him

919
00:59:16,298 --> 00:59:18,034
that we're
very displeased

920
00:59:18,234 --> 00:59:18,668
with this whole mess.

921
00:59:18,868 --> 00:59:21,304
He won't dare make
another mistake.

922
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:23,940
Not if he wants
to do business with us.

923
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,342
I made that
very clear.

924
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:28,745
What time's
our flight?

925
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:29,979
Midnight.

926
00:59:30,179 --> 00:59:33,816
We better check out.
I'm afraid we won't be able

927
00:59:34,016 --> 00:59:36,185
to use
our dinner reservations.

928
00:59:36,385 --> 00:59:38,788
What a nuisance.

929
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:44,461
Wake up.
Somebody's coming.

930
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,663
Where are we?
I can't see a thing.

931
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:48,364
Right back where
you put us.

932
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:50,516
Hey, pop the trunk,
will you?

933
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:52,669
Better play dead
or you will be.

934
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:04,564
That kid is
still out cold.

935
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:06,483
You want to kill him now

936
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:08,651
or wait till
the chloroform wears off?

937
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:10,286
Wait till we get
to the desert.

938
01:00:10,486 --> 01:00:11,721
What's taking
Rice so long anyway?

939
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:14,356
It can't take him 2 hours
to divide up the money.

940
01:00:14,556 --> 01:00:16,125
I think we
should get extra

941
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:18,127
for killing the kid.

942
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:19,462
You're right.

943
01:00:19,662 --> 01:00:22,298
Let's go
hurry him up.

944
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:33,509
We'll never
get out of here.

945
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,644
Stay cool.
I'm thinking.

946
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,780
What are we
going to do?

947
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:51,694
Open the door.

948
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,598
Wait a minute.

949
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:57,166
What are you doing?

950
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:58,651
There's
a phone here.

951
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:00,136
Let's get out of here.

952
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:02,572
I'm calling Kim.

953
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:06,108
We better get out of here
and find some weapons.

954
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:09,946
Mom?

955
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:10,980
No, Kim, it's me.

956
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,231
Have you told
your mom yet?

957
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:13,482
No, she hasn't
come home yet.

958
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:14,283
She left a note,

959
01:01:14,483 --> 01:01:15,351
but I can't read
her writing.

960
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:16,185
Listen, you got to get
to the airport right away.

961
01:01:16,385 --> 01:01:18,254
The spies
have the tape.

962
01:01:18,454 --> 01:01:21,791
They're kind of old.
A man and lady.

963
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:23,025
She only has 3 fingers.

964
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:24,143
Where are you?

965
01:01:24,343 --> 01:01:25,061
I'm in a car.

966
01:01:25,261 --> 01:01:27,063
Listen,
they're catching a plane

967
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:28,297
to Mexico City
at midnight.

968
01:01:28,497 --> 01:01:30,733
How am I supposed to get
to the airport?

969
01:01:30,933 --> 01:01:31,801
Use your bus pass.

970
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:33,269
Duck!

971
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:38,975
I want you boys
to pay attention.

972
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,192
You do what I tell you.

973
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:41,210
Keep your mouths shut.

974
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:44,747
There's a lot more where
that came from.

975
01:01:44,947 --> 01:01:47,316
What about the girl?
You want us to get her, too?

976
01:01:47,516 --> 01:01:50,019
No. I already
took care of that.

977
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:51,988
What's that?

978
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:53,590
Garage door
opener.

979
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,425
What are you going to do,
crush her with a garage door?

980
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,660
Not quite.

981
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,578
This is a trigger
for a clock.

982
01:01:59,778 --> 01:02:01,297
It'll set off
enough plastique

983
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:02,799
to blow up her and
half her neighborhood.

984
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,266
You might have
told us.

985
01:02:04,466 --> 01:02:05,868
We could have been
blown up with her.

986
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:08,504
That's why
I used a timer.

987
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:09,171
I told that kid,

988
01:02:09,371 --> 01:02:11,941
"If you cross me,
she's going to die."

989
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:13,709
So now,
in exactly one hour,

990
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:16,795
our little friend's
gonna have

991
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:19,882
a very short,
very loud nightmare.

992
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:25,187
That will
be midnight.

993
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:27,256
Yeah. I got to
call Kim.

994
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:27,957
Go get the van.

995
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:30,092
Let's get these bodies
out of my trunk.

996
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:31,828
Not now you don't.

997
01:02:32,561 --> 01:02:34,631
Haverman's
got the key.

998
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,466
I'll pop it open
from the glove compartment.

999
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,836
That's all right.
I've got mine.

1000
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,475
He was in there
5 minutes ago.

1001
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:47,977
Great, Alvarez.

1002
01:02:48,177 --> 01:02:50,647
Haverman,
the kid's gone.

1003
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:53,816
All right,
let's get out of here.

1004
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:57,353
What?

1005
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,027
You got to tell me
how to drive this thing.

1006
01:03:05,227 --> 01:03:08,097
I don't know.
This is a real car.

1007
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,336
Ohh!

1008
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:19,008
Ok. So much for backing up.

1009
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,843
Let's try forward.

1010
01:03:29,051 --> 01:03:31,153
Peel out, Davey.

1011
01:03:41,163 --> 01:03:43,532
Not bad
for a first lesson.

1012
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:58,014
Don't shoot
at my car.

1013
01:03:58,214 --> 01:03:59,916
What are you, crazy?

1014
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:11,460
Well, that pretty well
covers parking.

1015
01:04:13,429 --> 01:04:16,098
Give me that.
Go get the van.

1016
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,102
Let's go.

1017
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:28,811
You're doing
just fine, Davey.

1018
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,180
Push the pedal
to the metal!

1019
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:38,120
Whoa!

1020
01:04:57,506 --> 01:05:00,376
Take a right here,
Davey.

1021
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:03,912
Ooh!

1022
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:08,317
Good. Excellent.

1023
01:05:09,551 --> 01:05:10,219
Sweeper.

1024
01:05:10,419 --> 01:05:13,155
Left, Davey.
The sweeper! The sweeper!

1025
01:05:16,525 --> 01:05:19,428
Road hog!

1026
01:05:20,596 --> 01:05:21,930
Construction!

1027
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:42,251
Kim's already left.

1028
01:05:42,451 --> 01:05:44,821
She's safe.
Come on, let's go.

1029
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:47,056
What if they planted
the bomb on her?

1030
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:48,524
How?

1031
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:52,528
Lady Ace.
Lady Ace, come in.

1032
01:05:52,728 --> 01:05:54,797
Hello, Davey.

1033
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:57,733
Hello.
Can you hear me?

1034
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:01,270
Why won't she answer?

1035
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:03,205
She probably dropped
her walkie-talkie.

1036
01:06:03,405 --> 01:06:05,274
Walkie-talkie.

1037
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:09,545
Cheap thing.

1038
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:11,913
We got to save Kim!

1039
01:06:12,113 --> 01:06:13,315
Right there!
Uh-oh.

1040
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,285
First we got to find
some hardware

1041
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:18,120
and blast
these guys.

1042
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,088
Come on.

1043
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:20,122
I'm calling Dad.

1044
01:06:20,322 --> 01:06:21,490
That guy thinks
you're a nutcase.

1045
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,691
Come on.
Get out of here.

1046
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:24,060
Come on!

1047
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:37,606
He's gone.

1048
01:06:37,806 --> 01:06:39,925
No kidding, Alvarez.

1049
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,044
Give me the case.

1050
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:43,645
All right, you stay
with the van.

1051
01:06:43,845 --> 01:06:44,446
We'll go on foot.

1052
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:45,647
He can't have
gotten very far.

1053
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:47,316
Come on. Let's go.

1054
01:07:00,262 --> 01:07:02,431
This is starting
to get good.

1055
01:07:02,631 --> 01:07:03,232
What?

1056
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:04,883
Just like
Cloak and Dagger.

1057
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,335
They're trying
to kill us.

1058
01:07:06,535 --> 01:07:10,639
They can't kill me.
They can't see me.

1059
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,241
They can kill me.

1060
01:07:12,441 --> 01:07:13,542
Not if you're
good enough.

1061
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:16,612
That's what this game
is all about, right? Right?

1062
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:17,446
Kelly Field.

1063
01:07:17,646 --> 01:07:18,881
Uh, yes. I'd like
to speak to

1064
01:07:19,081 --> 01:07:20,649
Master Sergeant
Hal Osborne, please.

1065
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:21,967
It's his son calling.

1066
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,085
Just a minute.

1067
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:25,121
Come on. You're wasting
valuable combat time.

1068
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:26,555
Yeah, thanks.

1069
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:27,957
Hello.

1070
01:07:28,157 --> 01:07:28,958
Dad, you got
to help me.

1071
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:30,559
Davey,
why aren't you in bed?

1072
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,161
The spies,
they planted a bomb

1073
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:32,962
in Kim's
walkie-talkie,

1074
01:07:33,162 --> 01:07:34,330
and she doesn't
even know it.

1075
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:35,397
Hang up.
Let's go.

1076
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:36,398
I told you
I didn't want you

1077
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:39,135
to get into those games.
You understand that?

1078
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:40,119
Dad,
this is no game.

1079
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:40,903
Now, I need
your help.

1080
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:43,172
Davey, look,
I got a rush job here.

1081
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:44,173
I do not have time...

1082
01:07:44,373 --> 01:07:44,974
Would you listen to me?

1083
01:07:45,174 --> 01:07:46,325
They're trying
to take the plans

1084
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:47,676
out of the country
at midnight.

1085
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:48,377
Just calm down.

1086
01:07:48,577 --> 01:07:50,412
I don't want you
to get worked up again.

1087
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,297
I'll be home just
as soon as I can.

1088
01:07:52,497 --> 01:07:54,183
What did I tell you?
He's useless.

1089
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:55,184
Dad, I'm not home.

1090
01:07:55,384 --> 01:07:57,369
Now, please, just
listen to me for once.

1091
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:59,479
I promise you
I'm telling the truth.

1092
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,652
Now, you don't have
to worry about me,

1093
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:03,825
but get to Kim before
the bomb goes off

1094
01:08:04,025 --> 01:08:04,660
at midnight.

1095
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,462
What do you mean you're
not home? Where are you?

1096
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:08,530
I don't know. I'm in
a telephone booth.

1097
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:09,298
Davey,
now listen carefully.

1098
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:11,233
I want you to stay right
right where you are

1099
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,868
and don't get out
of that phone booth.

1100
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:23,679
Davey?

1101
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:28,084
What's
with him?

1102
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,653
One down
and two to go.

1103
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:33,222
Come on.
Get the gun.

1104
01:08:33,422 --> 01:08:34,090
No.

1105
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,424
Davey, come on.
Get with it.

1106
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:36,425
If you're going
to win this game,

1107
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:37,926
you got to take advantage
of breaks like this.

1108
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:39,061
Get the gun.

1109
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,245
We got to get
across town

1110
01:08:40,445 --> 01:08:41,430
and get a bus
to the airport.

1111
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,331
Davey!

1112
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:43,799
Along the river.
It's the fastest way.

1113
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:45,634
Play right!

1114
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,043
11:35.

1115
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:28,510
I'm not going
to make it in time.

1116
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,280
You're going to have to
take these guys out.

1117
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,682
You know that,
don't you?

1118
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:02,944
All right, it's time for
the heavy artillery.

1119
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:04,295
Let me have it.

1120
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:05,647
You got it.

1121
01:11:04,573 --> 01:11:05,341
Uhh!

1122
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:08,577
Now just wait right here
and take them out.

1123
01:11:08,777 --> 01:11:11,913
I don't want
to kill anybody.

1124
01:11:12,113 --> 01:11:13,715
You know the rules.

1125
01:11:13,915 --> 01:11:15,417
You're supposed
to take out the obstacles

1126
01:11:15,617 --> 01:11:16,552
before reaching
the objective.

1127
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:19,588
Can't just go right for
the objective. That's no fun.

1128
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:20,856
Fun?

1129
01:11:21,056 --> 01:11:22,891
We've got 24 minutes

1130
01:11:23,091 --> 01:11:25,261
before the bomb
goes off.

1131
01:11:25,461 --> 01:11:27,529
That's why you have
to take them out.

1132
01:11:29,064 --> 01:11:30,399
Look, how many people

1133
01:11:30,599 --> 01:11:31,600
have I killed for you
over the years?

1134
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,186
And now you're saying
you don't want to play?

1135
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:36,772
Now, come on, this is
Cloak and Dagger for real.

1136
01:11:36,972 --> 01:11:38,774
It's what
you always wanted.

1137
01:11:38,974 --> 01:11:41,577
Yeah, but I don't have
a gun or a knife

1138
01:11:41,777 --> 01:11:42,444
or anything.

1139
01:11:42,644 --> 01:11:43,879
The Crossfire Gambit.

1140
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,214
Remember
the Crossfire Gambit?

1141
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:48,466
Now go back down there
and hide.

1142
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,519
Wait till the first guy
passes you.

1143
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,589
Then get Rice's attention
and lead his fire.

1144
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:55,056
You understand?

1145
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:59,728
Davey, if you don't
save Kim,

1146
01:11:59,928 --> 01:12:01,930
who's going to?

1147
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:07,469
Ok.

1148
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,439
Good luck.

1149
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:06,622
Hey, Ricey!
What's the matter?

1150
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:09,124
Can't shoot straight?

1151
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:18,416
Good work, Davey.

1152
01:14:18,616 --> 01:14:20,101
Now pick up the gun.

1153
01:14:20,301 --> 01:14:21,470
He's dead.

1154
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,672
Never mind that.
You're winning.

1155
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:25,741
Pick it up.
Come over here.

1156
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,476
My dad was right.

1157
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,378
I don't want to
play anymore.

1158
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:31,813
Davey, don't chicken out
now! Come on!

1159
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:37,719
Hurry up.

1160
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:42,057
Good boy.

1161
01:14:42,257 --> 01:14:45,861
Now hide behind
this tree.

1162
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:47,763
Wait, Davey!

1163
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:49,665
It's a dead end!

1164
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,049
Don't come any closer,
or I'll shoot.

1165
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:42,984
Sure you will...

1166
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:44,920
with red ink.

1167
01:15:45,987 --> 01:15:49,257
Only this one
shoots real bullets.

1168
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,394
I'm warning you.

1169
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:54,763
This is not
a water pistol.

1170
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:55,831
Neither is this.

1171
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,600
I could turn you
into shredded meat

1172
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,670
in about 3 seconds with
this baby if I wanted to.

1173
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:04,005
But you've been
a real pain in the neck,

1174
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:06,825
so I'm not going
to be that nice.

1175
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,445
You know what
I'm going to do, boy?

1176
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:12,047
I'm going to blow
both your kneecaps off.

1177
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:14,550
It won't kill you,

1178
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,753
but it'll hurt worse than
any dying you can imagine.

1179
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,722
Then you know what
I'm going to do to you, huh?

1180
01:16:20,922 --> 01:16:22,624
Shoot him, Davey.

1181
01:16:22,824 --> 01:16:23,291
Shoot him.

1182
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:25,494
I'm going to shoot you
in the stomach.

1183
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:28,664
Then when you beg for me
to finish the job,

1184
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:29,397
I won't do it.

1185
01:16:29,597 --> 01:16:32,901
I'm just going
to watch you die...slowly.

1186
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:33,835
Shoot.

1187
01:16:34,035 --> 01:16:35,771
Pull the trigger.

1188
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:40,041
Please stop. I don't
want to shoot you.

1189
01:16:40,241 --> 01:16:42,410
But I want
to shoot you.

1190
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:43,579
Kill him.

1191
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:46,782
The guy's a jerk!
Kill him!

1192
01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:51,119
All right, I'll show you
what a real hero would do.

1193
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:53,188
Watch this.

1194
01:16:53,388 --> 01:16:56,324
Just get him to
shoot over here, ok?

1195
01:16:56,524 --> 01:16:57,926
Agent X will bounce
the bullets

1196
01:16:58,126 --> 01:16:58,994
right back at him.

1197
01:16:59,194 --> 01:16:59,895
Come on.

1198
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:02,097
Come on, turkey, shoot.
Come on.

1199
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:03,965
Right here. Hit me!

1200
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:06,167
Jack, don't!

1201
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:11,339
No!

1202
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,661
Jack...

1203
01:17:37,232 --> 01:17:39,000
Good work, Davey.

1204
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,001
You won.

1205
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:41,837
You're not dead!

1206
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:43,939
No, he never
touched me.

1207
01:17:44,139 --> 01:17:47,776
I guess this thing
doesn't stop real bullets.

1208
01:17:50,478 --> 01:17:52,914
He could see you.

1209
01:17:53,114 --> 01:17:57,218
I doubt if he had
the imagination.

1210
01:17:57,418 --> 01:17:59,170
Anyway, who cares?

1211
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,122
You're a hero.

1212
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,594
Hey, Davey.

1213
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:10,799
Look, you killed the bad guys,
you won the game.

1214
01:18:10,999 --> 01:18:12,434
How do you feel?

1215
01:18:12,634 --> 01:18:13,869
That wasn't fair.

1216
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,121
You tricked me!
You made me kill him.

1217
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,515
It was a clear case
of self-defense.

1218
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,130
Come on. Let's go
to the airport.

1219
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,745
I don't want
to play anymore!

1220
01:18:28,516 --> 01:18:30,886
I see.

1221
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:33,454
Why do kids
always say that?

1222
01:18:33,654 --> 01:18:34,255
Huh?

1223
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:36,324
Your father
said the same thing.

1224
01:18:36,524 --> 01:18:40,461
After all those games of
Cowboys and Indians...

1225
01:18:40,661 --> 01:18:43,464
you get tired
of make believe,

1226
01:18:43,664 --> 01:18:47,002
you break your toys.

1227
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:51,673
Damn.

1228
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:53,274
He did hit you.

1229
01:18:53,474 --> 01:18:54,475
I'm ok.
Come on. Let's go.

1230
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:55,976
But you're bleeding.

1231
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:57,478
I'm ok. Come on.

1232
01:18:57,678 --> 01:19:00,081
Oh! Oh!

1233
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:04,886
I'll tell you what,
Davey.

1234
01:19:05,086 --> 01:19:08,489
M-maybe you better go
to the airport without me.

1235
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:11,192
No, I can't.

1236
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:13,729
No, no, no. Listen,
you're a hero now, Davey.

1237
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:17,065
You don't need an old
jelly blaster like me anymore.

1238
01:19:17,265 --> 01:19:19,334
Don't say that.
You'll be fine.

1239
01:19:19,534 --> 01:19:21,269
Never did like
that rule...

1240
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:24,639
leaving when
they stop believing.

1241
01:19:24,839 --> 01:19:28,009
Maybe I better
go get some help.

1242
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:29,878
No, don't go.

1243
01:19:30,078 --> 01:19:32,547
They wouldn't
be able to see me anyway.

1244
01:19:34,582 --> 01:19:36,251
Well...

1245
01:19:36,451 --> 01:19:41,256
It was fun while it lasted
anyway, wasn't it, pal?

1246
01:19:41,456 --> 01:19:44,225
But Jack Flack
always escapes.

1247
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,528
Want to
know something?

1248
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:51,566
You're the best
playmate I ever had.

1249
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:56,037
You can't
leave, Jack.

1250
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:58,373
I have to, kid.

1251
01:19:58,573 --> 01:20:00,842
You're growing up now.

1252
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:05,246
Listen...

1253
01:20:05,446 --> 01:20:07,482
Do me a favor,
will you?

1254
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:10,618
Go get me a smoke.

1255
01:20:10,818 --> 01:20:12,420
Over there.

1256
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:31,539
Jack,
where are you?

1257
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:39,180
Come back. I can't
do it on my own.

1258
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,949
Yes, you can.

1259
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:44,152
You were
always on your own.

1260
01:20:44,352 --> 01:20:46,421
Save Kim, Davey.

1261
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:55,130
The white zone
is for the immediate loading

1262
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,532
and unloading
of passengers only.

1263
01:20:57,732 --> 01:21:00,501
There is no parking.

1264
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,589
Hi. I'm David Osborne's
father.

1265
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:22,590
Oh, yes.
I know.

1266
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,059
Is Kim here?

1267
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:25,961
Isn't she
at your house?

1268
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:27,295
No, she's not.

1269
01:21:27,495 --> 01:21:29,280
Look, I just got
a call from David...

1270
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,374
Come here. I want to
show you something.

1271
01:21:31,574 --> 01:21:33,438
I just got back here.
And look at this.

1272
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,503
Is this another one
of your son's games?

1273
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:37,789
I don't think so.

1274
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:40,075
I need the phone.

1275
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:41,092
What is it?

1276
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:41,910
Operator.

1277
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:44,379
Operator, let me
have the police.

1278
01:21:44,579 --> 01:21:45,914
This is an emergency.

1279
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:47,348
My name is
Sergeant Osborne.

1280
01:21:47,548 --> 01:21:50,585
I'd like to speak
to Lieutenant Fleming.

1281
01:21:50,785 --> 01:21:53,088
Is it Kim?
Is she...

1282
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,390
Why is he trying
to reach me?

1283
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:59,260
Two men were shooting
at a young boy.

1284
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,928
I'll have Fleming call...

1285
01:22:01,128 --> 01:22:02,397
Wait a minute!
I'll hold on.

1286
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:05,133
If you can connect me
with the lieutenant,

1287
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,067
I'll hold on, ok?

1288
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:07,402
Two men are dead
down at the river.

1289
01:22:07,602 --> 01:22:11,038
They were shooting
at a kid Davey's age.

1290
01:22:11,238 --> 01:22:14,675
You and me better get
to that airport.

1291
01:22:16,577 --> 01:22:18,246
Sir, which is
the airport bus?

1292
01:22:18,446 --> 01:22:20,248
That one over there.

1293
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:27,522
Is this the bus
to the airport?

1294
01:22:27,722 --> 01:22:28,389
Uh-huh.

1295
01:22:28,589 --> 01:22:30,591
I lost my bus pass.

1296
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:32,060
75 cents.

1297
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:33,394
I don't have it.

1298
01:22:33,594 --> 01:22:34,429
Have to get off,
then.

1299
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:36,264
Can't let you ride
for free.

1300
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:38,099
But you have to!

1301
01:22:38,299 --> 01:22:40,435
Listen, I'll pay you
when I get to the airport.

1302
01:22:40,635 --> 01:22:41,569
Sorry.

1303
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:53,148
Flight 146 to Mexico City
is about to board at Gate 15,

1304
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,415
Concourse "B."

1305
01:22:54,615 --> 01:22:55,550
Thanks.

1306
01:23:05,293 --> 01:23:07,262
Mister,
take me to the airport.

1307
01:23:07,462 --> 01:23:09,430
You got any money, son?

1308
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:10,398
Yeah, lots.

1309
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,333
10 bucks in advance.

1310
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:14,269
I don't
have that much,

1311
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:15,270
but I have to get...

1312
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:17,272
Forget it, kid.

1313
01:23:21,142 --> 01:23:22,877
Listen, I don't
have any money,

1314
01:23:23,077 --> 01:23:24,495
but I got to get
to the airport.

1315
01:23:24,695 --> 01:23:26,114
I'll find some way
to pay you

1316
01:23:26,314 --> 01:23:27,315
when we get there.

1317
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:28,583
It's a matter of
life and death.

1318
01:23:28,783 --> 01:23:30,585
What happened
to your leg?

1319
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:31,352
Nothing.

1320
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:34,222
Look, maybe we better
get you to a hospital.

1321
01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:35,757
That leg doesn't look
too good.

1322
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:37,158
I don't have time
for that.

1323
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:38,559
If I don't
get to the airport,

1324
01:23:38,759 --> 01:23:41,429
a girl is going
to die.

1325
01:23:41,629 --> 01:23:43,098
Get in.

1326
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:46,601
I was going home
that way anyway.

1327
01:23:46,801 --> 01:23:48,403
How long
will it take?

1328
01:23:48,603 --> 01:23:50,571
This time of night
about 10 minutes.

1329
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:57,612
But you have to stop them
from getting on the plane.

1330
01:23:57,812 --> 01:23:59,614
You see, they have
the "C" and "D" tape.

1331
01:23:59,814 --> 01:24:00,415
What?

1332
01:24:00,615 --> 01:24:01,866
A Cloak
and Dagger tape,

1333
01:24:02,066 --> 01:24:03,118
you know,
a game cartridge.

1334
01:24:03,318 --> 01:24:05,320
Only it has stolen
government plans in it.

1335
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,622
What does this couple
look like?

1336
01:24:07,822 --> 01:24:09,073
I don't know.
Kind of old.

1337
01:24:09,273 --> 01:24:10,850
The woman only
has 2 fingers.

1338
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:12,427
Maybe it was three.
I forget.

1339
01:24:12,627 --> 01:24:14,529
Will you just stop
that plane from boarding

1340
01:24:14,729 --> 01:24:15,163
before they take off
in it?

1341
01:24:15,363 --> 01:24:19,567
I think we better
talk to the chief.

1342
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:35,984
11:47.

1343
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:37,285
Can't we go
any faster?

1344
01:24:37,485 --> 01:24:38,619
I only have
a few more minutes.

1345
01:24:38,819 --> 01:24:40,588
Yes, sir, boss.

1346
01:24:47,628 --> 01:24:50,131
You mind
hand-searching that?

1347
01:24:50,331 --> 01:24:53,301
I don't want to put it
through that electrical doodad.

1348
01:24:54,502 --> 01:24:56,604
That's all the
description you've got?

1349
01:24:56,804 --> 01:24:58,606
I told you
we got cut off!

1350
01:24:58,806 --> 01:25:02,443
Look, all you got to do
is check their fingers. Jeez!

1351
01:25:02,643 --> 01:25:08,649
Transcon Flight 146
now boarding at Gate 15.

1352
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:09,951
That's their flight!

1353
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,653
All right, let me just
get this down here.

1354
01:25:12,853 --> 01:25:13,588
But there isn't time!

1355
01:25:13,788 --> 01:25:17,225
The white zone is
for immediate loading

1356
01:25:17,425 --> 01:25:19,327
and unloading of
passengers only.

1357
01:25:19,527 --> 01:25:22,129
There is no parking
in the white zone.

1358
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,932
Wait here. I'll find
some way to pay you.

1359
01:25:25,132 --> 01:25:26,167
Forget it, kid.

1360
01:25:26,367 --> 01:25:27,635
Thanks.

1361
01:25:38,379 --> 01:25:42,583
Southwest Flight 2 arriving
from Houston/Austin...

1362
01:25:42,783 --> 01:25:44,385
How do I
find somebody?

1363
01:25:44,585 --> 01:25:46,554
Tell me their name,
and I'll have them paged.

1364
01:25:46,754 --> 01:25:49,124
Uh, Kim Gardener.

1365
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:53,328
Kim Gardener, please report
to the information counter.

1366
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:56,597
Kim Gardener to the
information counter.

1367
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:10,645
Did they call my name?

1368
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:12,347
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

1369
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:14,799
What's your mother's
name and phone number?

1370
01:26:14,999 --> 01:26:17,252
I think they just said
Kim Gardener. That's me.

1371
01:26:17,452 --> 01:26:19,554
Just a couple
more questions, ok?

1372
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:24,392
Have you seen
a little girl around 8?

1373
01:26:24,592 --> 01:26:25,360
She has blonde hair?

1374
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,561
Is she boarding
on this flight?

1375
01:26:26,761 --> 01:26:28,429
Stop them!

1376
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:30,481
Just a second,
there, son.

1377
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:32,333
But they have
the cartridge!

1378
01:26:32,533 --> 01:26:34,669
I'm sorry, son. You'll
just have to go around

1379
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:36,837
and wait your turn.
Who you with anyway?

1380
01:26:37,037 --> 01:26:39,840
Mom, Dad!
Please don't leave me!

1381
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,576
Are they your folks?

1382
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:44,812
Just a minute, folks.

1383
01:26:45,012 --> 01:26:47,014
Would you mind
coming back here, please?

1384
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:49,417
Uh, the plane's
already boarding.

1385
01:26:49,617 --> 01:26:52,620
It'll wait. Let's get
this straightened out first.

1386
01:26:52,820 --> 01:26:56,524
Transcon Flight 6
from Miami/Atlanta

1387
01:26:56,724 --> 01:27:00,561
is now arriving
at gate 17.

1388
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,464
Is this your boy?

1389
01:27:03,664 --> 01:27:07,968
Do we look like we could
have a boy that age?

1390
01:27:09,003 --> 01:27:10,805
You putting
me on, son?

1391
01:27:11,005 --> 01:27:12,573
No, sir. I can prove
they're my folks.

1392
01:27:12,773 --> 01:27:14,475
How?

1393
01:27:14,675 --> 01:27:17,378
Look inside
that bag over there.

1394
01:27:17,578 --> 01:27:19,847
You'll find one of
my game cartridges...

1395
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:21,782
Cloak and Dagger.

1396
01:27:21,982 --> 01:27:23,717
May I see that
bag, please?

1397
01:27:23,917 --> 01:27:25,453
Officer,
this boy is lying.

1398
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:28,623
We've never seen him
before in our lives.

1399
01:27:28,823 --> 01:27:30,641
I still would like
to see that bag.

1400
01:27:30,841 --> 01:27:32,660
Will you give it
to me, please?

1401
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,545
Ok, thank you.

1402
01:27:34,745 --> 01:27:36,231
Kim!
Davey!

1403
01:27:36,431 --> 01:27:37,832
Give me your
walkie-talkie.

1404
01:27:40,335 --> 01:27:42,069
He grabbed
the gun!

1405
01:27:42,269 --> 01:27:43,821
Eunice,
grab the kid.

1406
01:27:44,021 --> 01:27:46,398
Please, stay back.

1407
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:49,005
Stay where you are!

1408
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:51,612
This has
a bom...

1409
01:28:05,693 --> 01:28:07,595
Here,
Lieutenant.

1410
01:28:07,795 --> 01:28:09,647
Take a look
at this.

1411
01:28:09,847 --> 01:28:11,699
What have
you got?

1412
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:13,668
Come on.

1413
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:21,476
We'll begin
boarding passengers

1414
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:23,678
seated in rows
1 through 15.

1415
01:28:23,878 --> 01:28:25,813
What's
going on here?

1416
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:29,984
Stay back!

1417
01:28:30,985 --> 01:28:32,987
Get over there!

1418
01:28:34,989 --> 01:28:37,324
Oh, my leg!

1419
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:40,527
Davey! Davey!

1420
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:43,531
Out of the way!

1421
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:46,567
They're wanted by the FBI
for selling military secrets,

1422
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:49,604
which were smuggled in
children's video cartridges.

1423
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:51,972
What about my son?

1424
01:28:53,007 --> 01:28:56,444
They've got divers
down there now.

1425
01:28:57,878 --> 01:29:00,848
Did this
belong to him?

1426
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,488
God.

1427
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:10,157
Why didn't
I believe him?

1428
01:29:10,357 --> 01:29:12,343
Lieutenant
Fleming?

1429
01:29:12,543 --> 01:29:14,529
A hijacking
at Gate 15.

1430
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:16,363
Hijacking?

1431
01:29:27,141 --> 01:29:29,444
I want a Code 3.
Code 3.

1432
01:29:30,678 --> 01:29:31,979
What happened?

1433
01:29:32,179 --> 01:29:33,614
2 people have kidnapped
a little boy...

1434
01:29:33,814 --> 01:29:35,315
Kim!

1435
01:29:35,515 --> 01:29:36,817
Mom!

1436
01:29:37,017 --> 01:29:39,754
Oh, honey, I was
so worried about you.

1437
01:29:39,954 --> 01:29:42,723
They've got
Davey out there.

1438
01:29:43,724 --> 01:29:45,526
What did they say?

1439
01:29:45,726 --> 01:29:48,229
If they can't get
a pilot

1440
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:50,598
to fly 'em to Cuba
within 5 minutes,

1441
01:29:50,798 --> 01:29:52,567
they're going
to kill him.

1442
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:53,601
My God.

1443
01:29:53,801 --> 01:29:55,536
What are you going to do?

1444
01:29:55,736 --> 01:29:57,738
FBI is sending over
their resident agent.

1445
01:29:57,938 --> 01:29:59,240
How long
before he gets here?

1446
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,608
It'll be a few minutes.
I just talked to them.

1447
01:30:00,808 --> 01:30:01,442
A few minutes?

1448
01:30:01,642 --> 01:30:03,611
That may be too late.
My son's on that airplane.

1449
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:05,546
He says we got
3 minutes.

1450
01:30:05,746 --> 01:30:06,514
He's bluffing.

1451
01:30:06,714 --> 01:30:08,916
He's bluffing
with my son's life.

1452
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:09,617
Let me go out there.

1453
01:30:09,817 --> 01:30:11,619
I'm a staff sergeant
out at Kelly Field.

1454
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:14,755
I'm licensed
to taxi airplanes.

1455
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:16,023
Forget it.

1456
01:30:16,223 --> 01:30:17,558
He won't
negotiate.

1457
01:30:17,758 --> 01:30:19,760
I think he's
flipping out.

1458
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,861
What do I do?

1459
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:24,965
Tell him a pilot's
coming out there.

1460
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:26,634
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1461
01:30:26,834 --> 01:30:27,468
Listen to me.

1462
01:30:27,668 --> 01:30:29,837
They might even buy
the uniform,

1463
01:30:30,037 --> 01:30:31,606
but what happens
when they expect you

1464
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:34,642
to take that plane
in the air?

1465
01:30:34,842 --> 01:30:36,611
I'll fake it.

1466
01:30:39,046 --> 01:30:42,049
One more minute, and I blow
this kid's brains out.

1467
01:30:42,249 --> 01:30:44,118
But this
thing has...

1468
01:30:44,318 --> 01:30:45,720
Shut up! Shut up!

1469
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,239
George, remember
your blood pressure.

1470
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:50,758
Darn kid's messing
everything up.

1471
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:51,559
Calm down.

1472
01:30:51,759 --> 01:30:54,228
As long as we've
got the boy,

1473
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:56,897
they'll have to
give us a pilot.

1474
01:31:06,807 --> 01:31:09,143
Which one do I pull?

1475
01:31:10,611 --> 01:31:13,848
Jack?

1476
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,684
Here comes
someone now.

1477
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:28,195
Oh.

1478
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:35,336
Jack, please come back.

1479
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:37,738
I didn't mean
to throw you away.

1480
01:31:37,938 --> 01:31:39,740
I need your help.

1481
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,775
Who are you?

1482
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:42,242
I'm the pilot.
I'm not armed.

1483
01:31:42,442 --> 01:31:44,444
Turn around.

1484
01:31:44,644 --> 01:31:46,447
Frisk him.

1485
01:31:46,647 --> 01:31:47,948
Where's the boy?

1486
01:31:48,148 --> 01:31:49,617
He's all right.
He's back there.

1487
01:31:49,817 --> 01:31:50,618
He's clean.

1488
01:31:50,818 --> 01:31:51,419
Close the door.

1489
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:53,237
Get into
the cockpit.

1490
01:31:53,437 --> 01:31:54,855
No funny
business,

1491
01:31:55,055 --> 01:31:58,693
or I'll blow
your head off.

1492
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:12,573
Watch him,
George.

1493
01:32:21,749 --> 01:32:23,718
Help me, Jack.

1494
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:30,157
What are you doing?

1495
01:32:30,357 --> 01:32:31,626
I have to pressurize
the cabin.

1496
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:34,094
Switch over there.

1497
01:32:49,744 --> 01:32:52,747
I have to
call the tower

1498
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:55,082
to get permission
to take off.

1499
01:32:55,282 --> 01:32:56,817
Is that all right?

1500
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,355
San Antonio Tower,

1501
01:33:01,555 --> 01:33:03,557
this is Flight 146.

1502
01:33:03,757 --> 01:33:05,459
San Antonio Tower,

1503
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:07,161
this is Flight 146.

1504
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:09,163
Jack, please
come back.

1505
01:33:09,363 --> 01:33:11,165
I can't do this
on my own.

1506
01:33:11,365 --> 01:33:13,233
I need your help.

1507
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:17,538
Jack...Jack.

1508
01:33:17,738 --> 01:33:21,709
Request permission
to taxi to Runway 15

1509
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:22,843
for reroute to Havana.

1510
01:33:27,715 --> 01:33:31,318
Jack, please come back.
I need your help.

1511
01:33:31,518 --> 01:33:33,554
This is captain
Jack Flack.

1512
01:33:33,754 --> 01:33:35,523
David Osborne, to
the cockpit right away.

1513
01:33:35,723 --> 01:33:37,858
What's the big idea?
You don't have to see the kid.

1514
01:33:38,058 --> 01:33:40,495
They told me
to make sure

1515
01:33:40,695 --> 01:33:43,330
the boy was all right
before I take off.

1516
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:47,668
Come on.

1517
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:49,537
You're wanted up front.

1518
01:33:49,737 --> 01:33:51,171
But the bomb goes off
in less than a minute.

1519
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:52,840
Come on, junior.

1520
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,675
Now!

1521
01:34:01,682 --> 01:34:02,683
George.

1522
01:34:03,684 --> 01:34:04,819
George!

1523
01:34:05,019 --> 01:34:07,254
George! George!

1524
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,990
Davey, get up here
right away!

1525
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,492
Dad!

1526
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:12,660
No, you don't!

1527
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:13,828
Let me go!

1528
01:34:14,028 --> 01:34:16,931
Dad!

1529
01:34:18,766 --> 01:34:20,735
Look, it's moving.

1530
01:34:22,837 --> 01:34:23,854
Dad!

1531
01:34:24,054 --> 01:34:25,072
Davey!

1532
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:27,174
George!

1533
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:31,678
Forget the boy
and get back here!

1534
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,816
Well, disarm it.

1535
01:34:42,456 --> 01:34:44,258
I don't know how.

1536
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:48,395
It's still going.
The door!

1537
01:34:49,496 --> 01:34:53,467
We got to get you
out of here.

1538
01:34:54,802 --> 01:34:57,504
It won't open with
the cabin pressurized.

1539
01:34:57,704 --> 01:34:59,273
George!

1540
01:35:00,374 --> 01:35:02,176
Open up!

1541
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:04,911
You'll never fit.

1542
01:35:05,111 --> 01:35:06,313
Never mind me.

1543
01:35:06,513 --> 01:35:08,782
Dad, I'm not going
without you!

1544
01:35:08,982 --> 01:35:11,251
Now take my hand.
Hold my hand.

1545
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:22,262
No, Dad! I'm not
leaving without you!

1546
01:35:22,462 --> 01:35:23,780
Let go of my hands!

1547
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,099
No! I'm not leaving!

1548
01:35:25,299 --> 01:35:28,268
When you hit the ground,
run away from the plane!

1549
01:35:28,468 --> 01:35:29,804
Dad, come with me!

1550
01:36:12,012 --> 01:36:13,480
Dad.

1551
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:16,783
Dad!

1552
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:34,501
Jack?

1553
01:36:39,506 --> 01:36:42,209
Jack?

1554
01:36:47,848 --> 01:36:49,416
Dad!

1555
01:36:49,616 --> 01:36:51,185
Son!

1556
01:36:53,187 --> 01:36:55,289
How'd you escape?

1557
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:58,092
Jack Flack
always escapes.

1558
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:00,895
I don't need
him anymore.

1559
01:37:01,095 --> 01:37:03,297
I've got you, Dad.
