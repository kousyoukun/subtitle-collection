1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,920
<i>There once was a young man, who
wanted to become the world's best archer.</i>

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>He was obsessed about it.</i>

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,640
<i>He left his wife and kids</i>

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>and headed east to find himself a master.</i>

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,880
I need to go to the toilet.
Why are there so few around here?

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,160
Be careful, these are so tight.
- Why did buy so small?

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,760
<i>Ladies... - We're not ladies.
We're single!</i>

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,600
Excuse me, but where's the exit?
- Can you follow a woman?

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,280
Just barely.
- He can't.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,480
Come, we'll show.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Don't run,
ladies... singles. - Come, come!

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
He follows!

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
What's that?
- My passport.

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,000
Why's the color so strange?
- It's an EU passport, got tanned.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,800
Let me see.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
Flying finn. - Where did you
buy this? Come with us.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,840
Hello.
- Hi! Pasi...

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,760
I don't look like a criminal, do I?

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Thank you.
- Thank you.

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,920
Thanks, singles.
- You're welcome. Watch out!

21
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,720
Hey.

22
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Porala here, hi.
There's some boozer in the staircase.

23
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
Yes, he's sleeping.

24
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,440
Is it Timo?
- What?

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,480
Hello!
- How do you know my name?

26
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm your father.

27
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
My father went to sea,
when I was three. - Yeah.

28
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,720
And then he came back.

29
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,160
Thanks for the concert.
- What concert?

30
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
The one tonight.

31
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Where you there?
- Yes.

32
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,000
You're good.

33
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Thank you.

34
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,720
I've at least understood
that belongings aren't everything.

35
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Yeah...

36
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,280
Go ahead.
- I need to practice.

37
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
I wouldn't mind.

38
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,280
Who's the drawer?
- Lumi.

39
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,120
My daughter.
- Who old is Lumi?

40
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Five.

41
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,640
They are in Rovaniemi.

42
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,320
My wife's from there. They'll accompany me
when the place gets furnished.

43
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Thank you.

44
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,800
Lumi...

45
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,800
I always thought you'd become a musician

46
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,120
We had that brown Fazer-piano

47
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,880
and on your mother lap you'd mash it
even before you could sit.

48
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,480
The piano was birch.
- Yeah, might have been.

49
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,080
So?
- What?

50
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,320
What do you want?
- Me?

51
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,240
I haven't heard about you in 35 years.

52
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,600
Your mother wanted,
that I wouldn't keep contact.

53
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,640
You do know she's dead?
- Yes, yes.

54
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,840
No, you didn't.

55
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
Colon cancer.

56
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
I took her to treatment
every week for three years.

57
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,120
I go to colonoscopy once a year.
- What's that?

58
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,880
A kind of a viewing.
- Sounds like fun.

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,840
It's hereditary, the cancer.

60
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I also have an inheritance for you.

61
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,440
What?
- Well, you are my only son.

62
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,920
I thought you could
accompany me.

63
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Where to?
- To the 'wolf border'.

64
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,120
'Wolf border'?
- Mmm.

65
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,120
Can you smoke outside?
- Sure, as well as in here.

66
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,800
Which hotel are you staying at?
I have trouble concentrating. - Hotel?

67
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,920
You can sleep there, in Lumi's bed.
I need to practice.

68
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
I won't bother you.

69
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,080
I think you already know how to play that.
- No, I don't...

70
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
I go, I go.

71
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,240
Listen, do you have a car?

72
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
No.
- But a driver's license at least?

73
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,680
Yes. - Good.
We can always rent car.

74
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,480
My feet are in such a bad shape
that I can't drive.

75
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,200
Timo Porala has been awarded
the nordic music prize.

76
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,040
Family comes before music.

77
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,480
Hi, to Rovaniemi.

78
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,840
<i>Step in.
- Thanks.</i>

79
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,920
Wait, we should put these on.

80
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,400
I hope there's no one home.
- No.

81
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,120
We never let the owner
be around at showings.

82
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Big expectations, and then they get offended
from the smallest criticism.

83
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,440
Idiotic owners have ruined
many good deals from me.

84
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,760
Are there any upcoming renovations?
- No, nothing.

85
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,880
Durable apartments.
But if you want, I can check.

86
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
So full of light.
- Yes, and look at here.

87
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,880
Why is this for sale?
- There's been changes in the family.

88
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,680
To tell you straight, the woman left,
the guy's intolerable.

89
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,880
She moved to Rovaniemi,
as far as possible from him I guess.

90
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,760
The wretch needs the money,
he's probably heavily in debt.

91
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,560
So, shall we make a bid?
These kinds tend to sell fast.

92
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,400
I have a teeing in an hour,
but it can moved

93
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,880
if we're ready to deal.

94
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,280
Don't... be afraid.

95
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,560
There's...
There's someone here. - Okay.

96
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,360
Good morning.

97
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,000
Well... well this is a lucky coincidence
that the owner is around.

98
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,120
Maybe you could tell something
about the housing cooperative.

99
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,440
This is no longer for sale.
- What?

100
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,200
You can stop selling this.
- What's this supposed to mean?

101
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,280
Thanks. Thanks a lot!

102
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,200
Hey girl! The other one...

103
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay then... Let's look this again
in the future. - Yeah, let's.

104
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,280
Fuck you!
- Great idea.

105
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,400
Good morning.
- Good morning.

106
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,960
Keep the rest.

107
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,640
Leo?

108
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,680
Father.

109
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,640
Father...

110
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,360
Did you say something?
- No.

111
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,360
Eat your breakfast so you'll have
enough energy. - I ate at the studio.

112
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,800
Listen, uneaten food
won't be taken to the grave.

113
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,760
You left really early this morning.

114
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,400
You were like that as a child.
Never sleeping past six.

115
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,840
And when you woke,
you'd immediately start to sing.

116
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,200
I have diabetes, in case you're wondering.

117
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,400
They're saying if I don’t take care of it,
I'm dead.

118
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,080
Once I tried to put you to sleep

119
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,120
the way they put budgies
and parrots to sleep.

120
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,200
You left me in dark?
- No, no.

121
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,640
You had chickenpox, and you had
been up at least three days.

122
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,880
I layered a big stack of towels and cloths
on top of your cot

123
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,320
and there you were alone in the dark.

124
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,920
With your mother we thought
you had fallen in sleep.

125
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,240
We started kissing.

126
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,720
A sound came from the cod:
"Tipitii-tipi-tipi-tipi-tii..."

127
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,400
Eurovision song.

128
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
I've already rented us a car.

129
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,160
I couldn't find anything else
at a moment's notice.

130
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Maybe you should drive.

131
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,800
Do you have keys?
- You don't need those.

132
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,240
It's a modern model.
Just put the red and blue together.

133
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Luckily there still are
these kinds that you can start.

134
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,800
Last time I drove through here,
you could see cows.

135
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,280
Are we still a long way off?
- What do you mean?

136
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,040
Haven't we passed the "wolf border"?
Ring road III is behind us. - Well...

137
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,120
We're still ways off.

138
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,560
I'll be there very soon.
I'll take a cab. Half a hour.

139
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,200
Goddammit, I'm sure you can skip one gig.

140
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,800
It's a symphony orchestra! The "wolf border",
of course I thought you meant Ring III.

141
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,400
I didn't fucking think that
it's thought to be the 'wolf border'!

142
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,120
Of course you fucking didn't!

143
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,160
How could I? I'm from the countryside.
Never heard of it.

144
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,200
We should get to know each other.
I'd like to know my only son.

145
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,920
It's good to start with lying.
- I didn't lie to you.

146
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,440
I don't believe a single word you say.
- But you, you lied to me.

147
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,640
Me? How so?

148
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Your family lives in Rovaniemi,
and you're selling the flat.

149
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,040
The broker came by?
- He did. I took care of it.

150
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,760
You have a sister in Jyväskylä.
A sister!

151
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,240
You thought we could stop by there first.

152
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,160
You said I'm your only son.
- Yes, son. The only son.

153
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,920
For fuck sake...

154
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,280
Hey...

155
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,600
Thanks for the ride.

156
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,840
Hey, there! Go there!

157
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,440
We need to take something with us.

158
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,760
Timo Porala here. Listen,
I can't play tonight.

159
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,960
I have a migraine.
It started yesterday at the concert.

160
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,640
I'll find a stand-in.
Thanks a lot.

161
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,760
I caught one! Come and help.

162
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,840
Can you pick it up?
- How?

163
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,440
Behind the head. Fast,
before it gets away.

164
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,320
Not from the line! Take it!

165
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,120
Good, Timo!
- Goddammit!

166
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,680
Now my shoes are all wet!
- Don't let it go!

167
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,360
At least a kilo.
- It's all slimy.

168
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,360
It's... Torpparinkuja 29.

169
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,520
My earns are ringing. Tinnitus is starting.
- I had it for many years,

170
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,360
when I was touring with the band.
I was about to crazy.

171
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,440
It'd start from the smallest clang.

172
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,360
When someone threw keys on the table,
or a ping from a pint, anything.

173
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,360
What did you play?
- Bass.

174
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,760
Okay. - I sang as well.
I sang a lot. I hymmed.

175
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,880
You did what?
- Hummed. You know.

176
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,920
Look! What do we have here?

177
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,200
Look, a new travel companion. A cat!

178
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,920
You'll wait in the car
as we visit the relatives.

179
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,120
Paakku? Have you told them
that we're coming?

180
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,320
In Finland you can visit relatives
just by knocking at the door.

181
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
That's how it is.

182
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes?

183
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,360
Is your surname Paakku?
- Yes.

184
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,360
Do you have a wife called Minna?
- Yes.

185
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Leo, Minna's father.

186
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,480
Timo, Minna's brother.

187
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,600
Sorry, but what is this?
- We've come for a visit. Here you are.

188
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,040
Minna's sleeping.
- Darling, who's there?

189
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,680
Minna!
- Your father came for a visit.

190
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,920
We have a cat with us, in the car.

191
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,240
So if you don't want the fish,
the cat can always eat it.

192
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,240
What can we cook from this?
- I don't know.

193
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,880
I hope we didn't disturb you
with our surprise visit.

194
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,360
No. - We were just screwing
for the first time in six months.

195
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,600
That's why Pertti is sulking.
- I'm not sulking.

196
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay...

197
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,800
<i>Why did you have to...
- It's true, isn't it?</i>

198
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,360
<i>When we talk about this,
it should remain between you and me.</i>

199
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,040
<i>Does it matter, who we talk about it?</i>

200
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,000
You somehow look familiar, Timo.
- Okay

201
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,800
You do look alike.
- Do we?

202
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,680
Hey... Is this Anja?
- Yes.

203
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,680
Her mother.
Your mother I met after her.

204
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,920
Help yourselves.
We've grown the tarragons ourselves.

205
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
It's organic...
- Not a lot for me.

206
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,440
So... How...

207
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,440
I guess you've been in contact
trough Facebook. - Yes, little.

208
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,160
Father must've been a bit drunk.
- A bit.

209
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,680
You promised to visit sometime.
- And now I did.

210
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,200
What... what have you been doing for living?

211
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,760
I was a human statue for a while.

212
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,360
You know, with calcified hands and face.

213
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,880
It was a wonderful job,
but I had to end it quite quickly.

214
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,960
Why? - It's Impossible
to be still for long time.

215
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,400
Then, after the tsunami,
I moved to a monastery.

216
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,280
You're a monk?
- Well...

217
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,560
It must be an interesting occupation.
Or a spiritual... position.

218
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,360
At least more interesting than my job.

219
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,600
Pertti works as an interviewer
in a labor hire company.

220
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,560
As a recruiter.

221
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I'm like a headhunter.
- What?

222
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Head... Okay.

223
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,640
So, how's...

224
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,720
A monk needs to very disciplined...

225
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,320
Not nearly as much being a statue.

226
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,400
But I just do the laundry there
and clean and bake...

227
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
bread for the boys.

228
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,640
You can't make me into a monk...

229
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
Eat.

230
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you remember when father left?

231
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,160
No. I was maybe two or three.

232
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,160
I remember that it was empty and
mother was watching me play on the floor.

233
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,320
And she couldn't play the piano. I wanted
to hear the songs father used to play.

234
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,760
I remember him having hair
on his face and hands.

235
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,520
And he smelt bad.

236
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
Why did he even make a child
if he wasn't going to be around?

237
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,120
Maybe he was just horny.

238
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,560
Pertti and I have a difficult
period going on right now.

239
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,440
So don't wonder if things are a bit strange.
- Okay

240
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,440
I have a feeling that
Pertti doesn't appreciate me.

241
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,320
Why not?

242
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,400
Pertti would like me to
be cheerful and social.

243
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
Like some goddamn...

244
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,880
public relations manager.
That's probably his dream.

245
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,800
But I can't help it for being what I am.

246
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,400
Minna, she's the quiet type.
Maybe you've noticed.

247
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Spends all of her days online.
Almost nights as well.

248
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,160
My job's more social...

249
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,880
so we have at times,
how do you say it...

250
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,840
communication problems.

251
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,720
Could you please?
- What?

252
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,400
The whisk there.
- Oh, sure.

253
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,400
It's from oak sprigs, self frozen.
It's organic.

254
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,880
Dear god it feels god!
Really good!

255
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,280
We installed these rain like showers.

256
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,160
Minna had seen them in some decor magazine.

257
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,440
I thought it might become expensive

258
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,320
but if it makes her happy why not.

259
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,640
As a little girl I dreamed that
he'd remember my birthdays.

260
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
He never did.

261
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,280
Sometimes mom lied that
he had phoned when I was sleeping.

262
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,560
At Christmas I'd get a present that
was supposed to be from him

263
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,120
but it was wrapped on the same paper
as every other present.

264
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,320
I thought he'd send something
when he asked for the address.

265
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,400
I didn't think that he'd dare to come by.

266
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,840
At school I'd tell he's a musician
who's always on tour.

267
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,560
In third grade they started to ask
what band he was in.

268
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,760
I didn't even know what country he was in.

269
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,640
I hit one guy so hard he lost a teeth.

270
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,640
I couldn't hit another person.

271
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,120
I guess I'm the type that
can't hold her own.

272
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,240
Depressed in spring and fall.

273
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,120
And a bit in summer and winter as well.

274
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Did it feel good?
- Apparently.

275
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,600
Minna, here you are.
Happy birthday.

276
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,000
My birthday is in february.
- No worries.

277
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,880
I'm just well in advance.
- Thank you.

278
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,840
Would like me to open it?
- No, no.

279
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,320
Life really starts at 40.

280
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,520
You aren't quite as confused
as before that.

281
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,640
<i>Minna!
- Excuse me.</i>

282
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,440
<i>Minna! Come here, Skype!</i>

283
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,440
It's your Skype.
- Did it feel good?

284
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,600
What's here...

285
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,520
It's great that someone calls her.

286
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,720
Frankly she's pretty asocial.

287
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,240
Compared to me, she's asocial.

288
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,320
Pour one for me.

289
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,600
<i>Father!
- What?</i>

290
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,880
<i>Father!</i>

291
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,640
These chairs, they aren't
really made for sitting.

292
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,600
Thank you.

293
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
I need to make a call.

294
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,400
<i>Who do you have there?
- Surprise guest.</i>

295
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,800
<i>Hi! is it Anja?
Hi! Yes, it's me.</i>

296
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,520
<i>You haven't changed at all.
- Thanks, where are you?</i>

297
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,360
<i>Near Miami.</i>

298
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,160
<i>Earl, my husband,
owns a hardware store chain here.</i>

299
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Of course. You're looking good.

300
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
<i>Oh, thank you.
What do you do?</i>

301
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,400
<i>Well, nothing.
- Okay...</i>

302
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,560
<i>So you have 'downshifted'?
- All my life.</i>

303
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,400
<i>Listen, Leo... - Yes, yes, I love you
from the bottom of my heart.</i>

304
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,920
<i>Thank you... But it's really great that
you've come to see Minna.</i>

305
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,720
<i>She has really missed you.
- Yes, maybe it was the time for it.</i>

306
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,440
<i>So, were you ever imprisoned?
- No, well...</i>

307
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,200
It worked out fine.

308
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,520
<i>I play golf! Can you imagine, me,
an old commie.</i>

309
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,800
<i>Once I nearly missed out on getting a visa</i>

310
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,840
<i>because of running after
those men during studies.</i>

311
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,200
It's at ten o'clock in the morning.
Take a cab, I'll pay.

312
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,600
Thank you! Do you the piece?
Of course you do.

313
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,920
I'll make it to the evening show.

314
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,200
Okay, thanks.
This is how it goes sometimes. Bye.

315
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,600
So you're into music?
- You could say that, yes.

316
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,440
What kind of music do you like?

317
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,400
It varies.

318
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,200
Lately I've been listening to
Wagner and Schubert. - Okay.

319
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,680
Where do they come from?

320
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,040
They are composers.

321
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,400
But what kind of music?
- Classical.

322
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,080
Classical?

323
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,680
I'm more into the heavier stuff.

324
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,360
Would you like to hear?
- Sure, if you have more whisky.

325
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,960
I have something better.

326
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,760
Come.

327
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,840
Thank you.

328
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,640
You're welcome.
- This is lovely.

329
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,400
How was mother?
- Just fine.

330
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,920
It's pretty confusing...

331
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,840
this Skype.
- It is.

332
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Pirkko's horse stables?
Are you going for a ride?

333
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,360
No... an old acquaintance

334
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,960
At Kemijärvi?
- So it seems.

335
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,360
This is intense!

336
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,440
At gigs... they have bloody
sheep heads in pikes

337
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,400
and naked woman with hoods on the heads
hanging from crosses.

338
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,960
Minna doesn't like at all when I smoke

339
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,560
but I have to relax somehow!

340
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I feeling really good, hoh!
I feel free.

341
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,240
Are you feeling free?
- Sure.

342
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,840
Really, I mean it.
Are you feeling free?

343
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,720
Yes, yes.
- Dammit, more volume!

344
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,640
Now, Timo, now it comes!

345
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,800
Timo, now we love! I love the world!
I love you!

346
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,040
Timo, now we really love!
It's wonderful...

347
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,480
I cut mom's hair into a mohawk.
- Pretty wild.

348
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:28,520
Minna, call an ambulance!
- What is it? Calm down.

349
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,120
You calm down! My nose is broken!

350
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,360
It's not broken. Press here.

351
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,480
What is it?
- Goddammit, you have a sick family.

352
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,640
<i>Did you fall?
- What if I die?</i>

353
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,200
Was he hurt?
- No.

354
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,040
What did he say to you?
- I don't remember. I need insulin.

355
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,440
What? - Insulin. My blood sugar is high,
nerves can't take it.

356
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,960
All my medicine is at home
and I'm feeling strange.

357
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,680
Do you have diabetes?

358
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,480
Yes, since I was 12.

359
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,320
Knock, knock. How are you doing?

360
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,520
Could you please leave my house.

361
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
We can't throw them out
in the middle of the night!

362
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,720
You don't know these people!
- We're leaving.

363
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,880
Timo is very sorry.

364
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,680
It's just that alcohol and pot
don't mix well with diabetes.

365
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,080
Pot?! Dammit, Pertti! Why?

366
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,400
How could I have know that
he's all screwed up?

367
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,960
And you, keep your chin up
You're a great guy.

368
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,800
Am I?
- Yes.

369
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,200
Father, don't go. You just arrived.
- We really have to go.

370
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,320
Let's keep contact with that Facebook
or what ever it is. Okay?

371
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,480
I'll call you.
- Bye bye, Timo.

372
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,880
Bye, Leksa.
And bye, Timo.

373
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,520
Do you often hit people?
- No.

374
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,800
I don't remember you and mother together.
- You don’t?

375
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,560
How was it with you two?
- Well...

376
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,440
There was lots of love, but...

377
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,680
things just happened.

378
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,320
You bought us a color TV.
- What?

379
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,720
From the same trip I...
or we bought you

380
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,760
one of those foldable highchairs.

381
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,400
We were able to tie you there

382
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,320
and watch the Munich olympics in peace.

383
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,560
Mom wasn't interested in sports.
- She loved sports.

384
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,800
She hated it.
- People change.

385
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,280
Where was she buried?
- At Äänekoski.

386
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,480
What? Why? - She's from there.
Surely you remember that?

387
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,360
Did you say Äänekoski?

388
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,560
Of course. At Äänekoski.
Where else?

389
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,240
I scattered her ashes in here.

390
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,280
We'd often come fishing here
while visiting grandpa.

391
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,400
You had left many years earlier.
- Is he still alive? Your mother's father.

392
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,760
He died in the nineties.

393
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,160
Everybody dies.
- So we do.

394
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,040
But your grandma still lives.
My mother.

395
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Who? - My mother.
She lives in a sheltered home.

396
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,080
When's the next time you're free? - Between
Christmas and New Year I have few days.

397
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,240
Fucking idiot!
Why did you do that? Goddammit!

398
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,280
All the things I haven't taken care of!
- What things?

399
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,040
Fucking old man, you don't get it at all!
I don't want to be like you!

400
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,320
I want to fill my agreements and
not go away without telling anyone!

401
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,720
You can't fucking dry this up anymore!

402
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,560
Goddammit, you can't do that to
another person! - Sorry.

403
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,880
You fucking ruined my phone!
- Peace

404
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Peace...
- What the fucking peace?

405
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,960
Are you her grandson?
- Me? Yes.

406
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,240
Irja? Is Irja home?

407
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
Who's there?
- Mother, it's me.

408
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,320
Did you come back to live with me?
- Not quite yet.

409
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,120
This is my son Timo.

410
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,120
He has my eyes!

411
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,480
Do you have money?
- Yes, yes

412
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,280
You shouldn’t lie to your mother.

413
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,720
Thank you.

414
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,880
This is Antero, this boy?
- Timo.

415
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,520
Yes, now I remember.
You are a doctor.

416
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,480
Actually I'm not.
- Timo is a pianist.

417
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,120
And you are my husband.
- No.

418
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,640
No, no you're not! You left that
pretty dark haired girl

419
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,240
even thought you had such a fine son.

420
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,880
My mother was a blond.
- No, she wasn't really...

421
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,720
It was bad from you, Leo.
Leaving like that and not telling me.

422
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,040
Well... I've had my missteps, I admit.

423
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,520
It's not too great in here.

424
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,160
Awful food and all my neighbors
suffering from Alzheimer.

425
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,920
And those men clattering at night.
I guess they use sticks.

426
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,520
Sometimes they are wearing black masks.

427
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,400
Mother, would you like to visit home?

428
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,760
Whose home?
- Your home.

429
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,000
Us two strong men, we can help.

430
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,480
Can't we, Timo? Timo?

431
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,720
Couldn't we help mom to visit home?

432
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,440
Boys want go and party?
Sure, I'll go, always have.

433
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,120
That way!

434
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,520
There?
- Yes, there.

435
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,320
In here I'd always wait for your father.
His father didn't think much of me.

436
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,800
Was I 17 when I left home?
- I don't remember.

437
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,200
Father would've kept me cutting wood
for the rest of my life.

438
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,480
For him, having spent
five years at the front,

439
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,880
forest work was like camping.

440
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,760
He didn't understand that
a little kid could freeze to death there.

441
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,920
While working at the field,
he'd poke me with a pitchfork

442
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,040
if I was slacking at all.
He wasn't playing around.

443
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,120
One day he came to me and said

444
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,080
you can go dream after
your musician career.

445
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,040
He cave me fifty marks.
I thought 'all right'.

446
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,240
I called a cab.

447
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,480
I thought that if I have to leave,
I better do it with style.

448
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,160
I was an adult man the first time
I stepped into an apartment building.

449
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,760
And straight away having sex.

450
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,440
Stop, stop!

451
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,480
Rinta-Pattila, hello there.

452
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,320
Is that the Porala's son?
- The same one.

453
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,880
I haven't forgiven you and never will.

454
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,040
He put a snake into my boot
when he was a kid.

455
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,760
This is my son Timo.
- Hello.

456
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,160
Your father would pee on to an electric
fence when we'd incite him a bit.

457
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,760
We'd say that nothing would
come of him when he grows up,

458
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,120
but looks like god knows his job.

459
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,840
Where are you going?
- We're looking for my homestead.

460
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,520
Everything has just changed so.
- It's a prominent place these days.

461
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,240
I going to the same direction.
I'll go with you. - Jump in.

462
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,920
What the hell is this place?

463
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,840
They've built a little shop there.

464
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,040
It was nice to meet you.

465
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,400
Now I'll head to the slot machines
and put my EU endorsements into circulation.

466
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,360
Where are you going, mother?
- I'll go buy us all 'Negro’s kisses'.

467
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,200
They have plenty of different flavors.

468
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,320
You were born there?
- Goddammit.

469
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,120
Our cow-shed was there.
And there, there was a big rock

470
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:42,520
that I'd climb on to,
when my parents where angry.

471
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,960
Good luck to you, boys.

472
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,840
Who knows if we'll see each other again.
- I'm sure we will.

473
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,880
Mother, this is for you.

474
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,320
Ohh! What is it called?
- I don't know. You can name it.

475
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,160
You are Harri Kirvesniemi.

476
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,160
I'll make a bed for it
in the nightstand. - Bye Bye.

477
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:26,080
What color was my mother's hair?
- She was a brunette.

478
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,960
Let's stop this nonsense.
- What nonsense?

479
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,280
I haven't grown up with
my real mother, right? - Well...

480
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,320
She was real to you of course.

481
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,440
Yes, but not biologically.
- No...

482
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,800
Did she say that to you?
- No, but you can sense it.

483
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,040
We didn't want to leave you.

484
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,960
Who is my mother?
- I will tell you.

485
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,160
In time. I will.

486
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,440
Hello.
- Hello.

487
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,160
A room for two.

488
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:01,520
Do you have a bonus card?
- I don't have one, maybe he has.

489
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,240
No.

490
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,200
Do you have some form of ID?
- Yes, here.

491
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,120
Let's go with this.

492
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,560
I'll take care of it.

493
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,320
It's forbidden to smoke
in the room. - What?

494
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,560
This is a smoke free hotel.

495
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,280
Unnecessary alert costs 5000 euros.

496
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,720
Okay.
- Thank you.

497
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,280
The bar's open. - What the hell
is wrong with my passport?

498
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:42,000
Do you know who Paavo Nurmi was?
- Yeah, he was a swell guy.

499
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,600
<i>Voilà.
- Merci.</i>

500
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,280
Great view.
- You can't smoke here.

501
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,040
What?
- You can't smoke in here.

502
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:06,360
What sort of a police state are
we living in? - I'll take a shower.

503
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,360
<i>The stall of Pirkko and Kalle.
- Hi.</i>

504
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,360
<i>Who's there?
- Leo. Is it Pirkko?</i>

505
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,960
Who is it?
- Can you call me later?

506
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,320
Who was it?
- Some salesman.

507
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,240
Don't you have any other shirt?
- What?

508
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,360
Hell, when women see this,
they'll swarm in like bees.

509
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,440
<i>Grandpa has a bar.
It is a minibar...</i>

510
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,400
Weren't we supposed to rest?
- I already rested.

511
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,920
I guess you've played before.
- Well, I tried once or twice.

512
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,440
Okay.

513
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,800
Look, look!

514
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,480
He sure has a shirt.

515
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,560
Those are ours.
- We can't go...

516
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,440
Of course we can! Come.
Or do you need some encouragement? - No.

517
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,240
Good evening. We are in the need of a bit...
sorry a lot of company.

518
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,480
Since you're by far the pretties women
around, could we treat you two to drinks?

519
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,080
You'll just throw in some knockout drops.
- We don't have to.

520
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,440
Well, the seats are free.
- Put it on the bill.

521
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,520
My son. He's shockingly talented.

522
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,800
How did you know that I like whisky?

523
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,280
You looked like that.

524
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,920
Why isn't there any music? Where's the band?
- There are enough musicians around.

525
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,760
Where?
- Here! Timo.

526
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,080
I don't really feel like it.
- Come on!

527
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,480
You want to bet that neither
of them can play a single note?

528
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,760
Tenner.
- Sure.

529
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,440
Come girls, come and dance.

530
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,840
You're pretty.

531
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,080
What is it?
- Shall we go to your room?

532
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,320
Well.. okay.

533
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,240
This is it.
- It's nice, bigger than ours.

534
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,400
Okay.

535
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,200
I'll put on some music.

536
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,960
What's next?
- You tell me.

537
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,960
What is it?

538
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,640
What's wrong?

539
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,640
<i>Who's there?
- It's me, Maarit! Open up!</i>

540
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
It's mom.

541
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,000
Your father's not well.

542
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,360
How's your blood sugar?
- What sugar?

543
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,400
What are you going on about?
Just a little stronger orgasm.

544
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,720
Goddammit, this will get expensive.

545
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,280
Have you noticed that the meter is in red?

546
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,440
What meter?
- The gas meter.

547
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,680
Fuck!
- What now?

548
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,200
The chick cleaned me!
- What tricksters.

549
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,920
They cleaned me as well.

550
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,440
Let's go back!
- They're far gone.

551
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,240
And it was worth it, wasn't it?

552
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,880
Father and son in adventure!

553
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,200
How do we get gas?
- What?

554
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,960
How do we get gas?
- I have two euros.

555
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,200
The one is from mom,
the other I had for myself.

556
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:05,160
Use the one with cashier payment.
- With two euros?

557
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,640
No, fill it up and off we go.

558
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,200
Lumijoki. Lumi...

559
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,440
How far are we from Rovaniemi?
- What's there?

560
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,840
Where do your kid and ex-wife live at?

561
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:09,360
We're not going there.
- Of course we are, we're this close.

562
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,280
I haven't seen them since they left.
- Maybe it's time?

563
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:18,000
Besides, I want to see my only grandchild.

564
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,640
If Tiia has a new man,
I'm not coming in.

565
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,880
I doubt she has a man.

566
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,640
No new man?
- Come on now.

567
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,840
Come!

568
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,000
Riku!

569
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,640
Someone's there. Stay here.

570
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:57,000
What are you creeping here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

571
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,560
We were just driving by. - No, we weren't.
We came specifically for this.

572
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:09,760
This is my father.
- Hi, Lumi.

573
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,360
Grandpa bought you a surprise gift.

574
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,040
I can come anytime to fix the shelf.
- I'll call you.

575
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,760
We should take the speaker cords
trough the wall so that she won't trip.

576
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,160
I'll bring a hammer drill next time. Isn't
this a wooden house? I'll bring it anyway.

577
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,920
I'll call you.
- Yes, call.

578
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,320
You were given a kite.
- I can fly this with you.

579
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,960
We'll go out.
- Sure. Would you like some coffee?

580
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,400
I want coffee.
- Yes, please.

581
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,320
Go, go!
- What?

582
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:12,000
Fool. Just say you want milk.

583
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,360
Big guy.
- Who?

584
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,800
This fixer.

585
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,080
How are you doing?
- We?

586
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,800
We're fine.

587
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,840
You have a new wading pool.
I said I'd be sending one.

588
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,680
Riku got it.
An old from his sister's family.

589
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,600
It's been so hot summer.

590
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:23,320
Did the one that I sent arrive?
- Yes. I have it.

591
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,840
It's there.

592
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,120
I'll go see what they are doing.
- Yeah.

593
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,840
Look! Did it rise?

594
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,880
You need to run.
- This won't fly anywhere.

595
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,080
Yes it will.
Let daddy show.

596
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,080
Look at this, Lumi.

597
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,320
Runway's too short.
- Look here!

598
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,320
Let's go! Look!

599
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,720
It will fly!

600
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:51,640
What a butterfly!
- Look, Lumi!

601
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,280
The stall of Pirkko and Kalle.
Hello? Hello?

602
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,600
No one answered?
- No.

603
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,840
Where's Lumi?
- Upstairs.

604
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:31,240
This tale is about the best gooseberry
in the world. Do you what it is?

605
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,440
Okay. The monk turned 40

606
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,280
and had never dared to go
into the jungle.

607
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,200
Since it was his birthday
he decided to a little further.

608
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,360
He started to follow a path.

609
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:48,840
Suddenly he heard panting behind him.

610
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:52,040
A large tiger was following him.

611
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,360
He increased his speed but tiger
wouldn't go away.

612
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,960
It wasn't in a hurry. It knew that
the monk was there for the taking.

613
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,000
The Monk started running and
came into a dead end.

614
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:10,520
There was a huge gorge in front of him,
at least 600 meters.

615
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,320
A few meters below was a ledge.

616
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:20,160
Just as the tiger was about to scratch,
the monk jumped on to the ledge.

617
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,440
He thought he was safe.

618
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:29,880
But there was an entrance to a cave,
another tiger was approaching from there.

619
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:33,440
The man saw a branch, grabbed on to it

620
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,280
held tight and bent his feet.

621
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:43,800
The other tiger scratched his knuckles,
the other his soles.

622
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:50,240
The monks hands started to get tired.
He thought about putting the branch

623
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,920
in his mouth and rest his hands.

624
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,560
At the same time he noticed
a beautiful gooseberry at his reach.

625
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,400
He couldn't contain himself.
He put it in his mouth

626
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,360
and understood that it must've been
the best gooseberry in the world.

627
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,000
It was also the last one he ate.

628
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,640
Oh well.

629
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,440
You should get some sleep.

630
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
She's sleeping.

631
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,360
Does he still play at night?
- Timo?

632
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,680
I don't think so.

633
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,280
He used to play the piano all night long
even thought we had a small child.

634
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Do you even want to know...
- I do. Please tell me.

635
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,200
Let's say that...

636
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,120
I don't want to live with a person
whom I have to be afraid of.

637
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,240
I understand.

638
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,840
My mom lives near and
I've longed to be back here.

639
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,360
To be rooted in someplace.
- Listen...

640
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:34,520
This other man,
did you know him from before?

641
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,160
No!

642
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:44,160
I don't have another man.
- Then who is this fixer?

643
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,240
He's a co-worker. He's recently divorced
and doesn't know how to be alone.

644
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,600
I'm not so desperate that
I'd pick the first man who says hello.

645
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,920
Timo would like to apologise to you.

646
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,080
Did he say that?
- He did.

647
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:20,480
I think I'll go to sleep.

648
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,760
Good night.
- Good night.

649
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,360
Your father went to sleep.
- Right.

650
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:01,360
I heard you wanted to apologise.
- Me?

651
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,120
Yes, your father said so.

652
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,040
I didn't want it to go like this.

653
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,000
Neither did I.

654
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,440
I'm sorry.

655
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,600
I'm sorry.

656
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,440
Hi, Lumi. Come here.

657
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:39,720
How are you doing?

658
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,120
Good.
- Good? Have you been having fun?

659
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,000
I've missed you.

660
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,000
What have you and mom been doing?
- I haven't been with mother.

661
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,160
I've been with Anna and Pete.
- Okay.

662
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:03,120
We had a sleepover.
- Are Anna and Pete your friends?

663
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,240
Yes, and Elvis.
- Elvis?

664
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,360
Elvis licks me sometimes.
- Really? Is Elvis a dog?

665
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,840
Today, when we arrived

666
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,560
A dark, big boy with a mustache
was here. Do you remember?

667
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,160
He was banging nails on the wall.
- Yes.

668
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,280
Does he come here often?
- Yes.

669
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,520
Has mom been having fun with him?
- Yes.

670
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,320
I've missed you terribly.

671
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,640
Come lie with me.

672
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,640
To Kemijärvi.

673
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,840
Good morning, Huiske.

674
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,560
Pirkko, hi.
- Leo...

675
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,280
Here's some flowers.
I picked them myself...

676
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,960
from a gas station.

677
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:43,320
Listen... I have Timo with me.
- Where?

678
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,720
I thought it'd be better
if we two met first.

679
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,840
I've been to his concerts.
Have you told about me?

680
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,600
You can tell him yourself.
His foster mother is dead.

681
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,760
Come in.

682
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,400
I'll make coffee.
- Thanks.

683
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,240
I thought they caught you, when you
didn't return from buying cigarettes.

684
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,120
The surveillance pictures were on the news.
It scared the hell out of me.

685
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,600
I waited two days in our hotel room.

686
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:33,160
I sat there on the bed amid all the empty
champagne bottles with the money on my lap

687
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,120
and ate peanuts.

688
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,080
Someone knocked.
I was sure that it's the police.

689
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,200
It was Kalle, our driver.
- Yeah.

690
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:02,440
He said that you and I were
celebrities. Like Bonnie and Clyde.

691
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,160
He got me out of there

692
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,880
and we hid the money to Hollola.

693
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,920
<i>And drove off to the country.
- To our cottage? Is it still there?</i>

694
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:17,400
<i>Yes. Police was waiting there.</i>

695
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:24,120
Timo was taken in custody,
and I was sentenced to eight years.

696
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:30,400
Timo doesn't remember you.
- No. He was so small.

697
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:40,960
<i>I thought that if I take off and
you could somehow escape.</i>

698
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:47,480
<i>I took a train to Oulu and
hitchhiked to the swedish border.</i>

699
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,560
<i>Do you have a family?
- No.</i>

700
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:57,160
When I was released, Kalle was waiting
at the gates with the money and a ring.

701
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,840
Resilient guy.

702
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:04,400
You could have contacted.
- I was embarrassed.

703
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,320
Hello.
- Look at that, Porala himself.

704
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,760
Hi.
- Hi.

705
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:21,600
You've grown up.
- Well, not much.

706
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,920
You've aged.
- Really?

707
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,720
I knew that you'd be standing in the line
the moment I wasn't looking.

708
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
Of course.

709
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,920
Everybody wanted her.
- Nonsense.

710
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,840
So you're having cognac
with your coffee. - Yeah.

711
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:47,240
Sit down.
- Wait a sec.

712
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,200
Do you remember,
what we agreed upon? - What?

713
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:57,920
When we are 40, we'll move in together,
if either doesn't have anyone.

714
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,360
You're a little late.
- No a lot. Almost 30 years.

715
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:11,040
Do you really think, Porala,

716
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,680
that you can just walk in here
and take my woman?

717
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,520
He's not taking anything.
- You shut up.

718
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,600
This place is my life's work,
you won't come and break it.

719
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,000
You took off.
You have no right for the money.

720
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,680
Pirkko has paid a hard price for it,
really hard.

721
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,800
I don't want... - Yes, you do.
Why else would you be here?

722
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,920
I just wanted to meet her.
- I know you.

723
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,480
You only have your self-interest in mind!

724
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,840
Goddammit!

725
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,680
Timo, let's go!

726
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,000
Goddammit!

727
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,000
Stop that shooting!

728
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:19,840
Did he get you? - No, just a scratch.
It scraped the side.

729
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,840
I'll take you to the hospital.
- No. Just drive.

730
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,680
You're bleeding!
- No hospital!

731
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,920
Where then?
- To the north!

732
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,760
From here.

733
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:35,680
No, there.

734
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:40,800
Gravel road. It's there.

735
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:04,960
I guess you heard, what your mother
and me were talking about. - I did.

736
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,640
The parents of a two year old rob a bank.

737
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,400
It happens.

738
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,880
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

739
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:25,120
Is everything all right?
- Yes, drive.

740
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,640
Leo?
- I'm having a heartburn.

741
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:06,800
It's stuck.
- Let's walk. It's not far from here.

742
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,360
There's a huge wound here,
it has gone through.

743
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,080
You tricked me again.
- You are easy.

744
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,920
I'll go get help.
- No, don't go!

745
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,760
You were conceived here!

746
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:13,520
I've always wanted to
bring you here

747
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,760
Timo hey... I'm cold.

748
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:26,440
Timo? It's really cold here,
isn't it?

749
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,880
Thank you.

750
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,880
Would you like to hear a story?

751
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,360
There once was a young man who wanted
to become the world's best archer.

752
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,000
He was obsessed about it.

753
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:27,440
He left his wife and kids

754
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,360
and headed east to find
himself a master.

755
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:36,480
The master said that he should
learn not to blink.

756
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,920
He saw weavers, took a pillow with him

757
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,440
and went to lie on his back below the loom.

758
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,840
He was below the skid and
kept his eyes open.

759
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,560
One morning he woke up and discovered

760
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:56,680
that a spider had made
a web on his left eye.

761
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:02,120
He said happily to the master that
he now knows how not to blink.

762
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:07,840
The master said, that he'd now
have to learn to see small as large.

763
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:12,840
"What? Small as large?"
There was a garden.

764
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,640
He went there and started to
watch small bugs.

765
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:24,520
He spent the whole summer watching them,
and the bugs started to look like horses.

766
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:30,520
He ran to the master and said
that he now sees small as large.

767
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:36,280
The master said fine. They went
near a very deep gorge.

768
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:40,320
There was a ledge. The master
said to the man to jump on the ledge

769
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:46,000
and shoot the black bird at 500 meters.

770
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,440
The man drew the bow and shot the bird.

771
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:54,640
The black bird fell on the ledge.
He was excited.

772
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:58,480
He looked to his mentor,
who said: "Look at this".

773
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,400
And picked an imaginary bow
and an imaginary arrow.

774
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,000
"You don't even have
a bow and an arrow."

775
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:13,360
The mentor said, that with
the bow and arrow you take steps,

776
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,640
but this is how you shoot an arrow.

777
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:20,640
He shot, and suddenly a white hawk
dropped on to the ledge.

778
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,920
It was too much for the ledge,
which started to sway.

779
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,040
The man screamed:
"I'm gonna fall, I'm gonna fall!"

780
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,400
The old man lent him a hand and said

781
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,760
to stop crying and pulled him up.

782
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,960
The man, who had wanted to become
a master archer, understood the whole thing.

783
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:49,480
He had thought about futile things
and returned home.

784
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,760
The man's son asked

785
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:02,360
since he didn't have a bow or arrows:
"Father, aren't you going to shoot anymore?"

786
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,080
Father said: "Listen..."

787
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:11,640
"The highest level of shooting
is not to sho..."

788
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,320
Father?

789
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,880
Father?

790
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:48,160
I haven't been here since
the police took you away from me.

791
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,480
Where's Leo?
