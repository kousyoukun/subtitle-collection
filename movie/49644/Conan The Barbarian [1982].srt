[Wizard] Between the time when
the oceans drank Atlantis...

3
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,680
and the rise
of the sons of Aryas,

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,000
there was an age undreamed of;

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,840
and unto this, Conan,

6
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,680
destined to bear the jeweled
crown of Aquilonia...

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,120
upon a troubledbrow.

It is I, his chronicler,

9
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,560
who alone can tell thee
of his saga.

10
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,840
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

11
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,360
[Man] Fire and wind come from the sky,

12
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,040
from the gods ofthe sky.

13
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,960
But Crom is your god.

14
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Crom, and he lives
in the Earth.

15
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,040
Once giants lived
in the Earth, Conan.

16
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,760
And in the darkness
of chaos...

17
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,680
they fooled Crom,

18
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,840
and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

19
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Crom was angered,

20
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,720
and the Earth shook.

21
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,120
And fire and wind
struck down these giants,

22
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

23
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,680
But in their rage,

24
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,360
the gods forgot the secret of steel
and left it on the battlefield.

25
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,320
And we who found it...

26
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,720
are just men.

27
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,760
Not gods. Not giants.

28

Just men.

29
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,280
And the secret of steel has
always carried with it a mystery.

30
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,560
You must learn its riddle,

Who gave you
