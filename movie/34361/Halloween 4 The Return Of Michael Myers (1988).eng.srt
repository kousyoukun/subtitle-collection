1
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:57,249
Ok, go on through.

2
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:19,064
All metal objects into the tray.

3
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,483
Purpose of visit?

4
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,238
A patient pick up and 
transfer to Smith's Grove.

5
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,365
You're late.
- Yeah.

6
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,408
Should be on the road.
- Yeah.

7
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,495
Hell of a night, huh?
- Real charmer.

8
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,121
Yeah. I'll take you down there.
- All right.

9
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,873
Let them in.
- Ok.

10
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:44,926
First time here, huh?
- Hope it's the last time.

11
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,595
You never get used to the faces. Never.

12
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,725
Jesus!

13
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,897
Jesus ain't got nothing 
to do with this place.

14
00:02:58,897 --> 00:02:59,899
Come on.

15
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:13,080
Yeah, this is where the society
dumps its worst nightmares.

16
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,045
Yeah the one you're picking up...

17
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:21,505
Just thinking about him
gives me the willies.

18
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,049
A decade ago, Halloween night...

19
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:27,136
He murdered 16 people...
maybe more.

20
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:28,595
Trying to get to his sister.

21
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:30,888
Nearly got her too.

22
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,310
But his doctor... of all people,

23
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,563
shot him... six times.

24
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:37,482
Then he set him on fire.

25
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:39,691
Both of them nearly burned to death.

26
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:43,905
Yeah, I'll be glad to see this one gone.
Yes, indeedy!

27
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:49,952
Welcome to Hell.

28
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:55,042
Doctor?
- Yes?

29
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,210
The transfer personnel are here.

30
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:03,216
Smith's Grove?
- Yes.

31
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:06,095
I'm Dr. Hoffman, medical administrator.

32
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,473
Has he been prepped?
- Ready to go.

33
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,140
Who signs for him?

34
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,309
I do.

35
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:12,936
Outside.

36
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:14,355
Check him out.

37
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,393
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.

38
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:54,063
Michael Myers is still his patient.

39
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,566
Well, if Loomis read memos, he'd be here.

40
00:04:56,691 --> 00:05:00,279
Fortunately his position is 
more ceremonial than medical.

41
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:02,030
And with Myers gone...

42
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:05,283
My hope is that he'll either transfer...

43
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,035
retire...

44
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:10,663
or die.

45
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,047
All right, let's move him.

46
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,350
Watch it.

47
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,560
I got this end.

48
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:36,400
I can safely say that Michael Myers 
is now in your hands.
- Yeah. I guess you're happy to see him go.

49
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:40,780
Locked and loaded.
- Let's roll.

50
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:42,906
Night, doc.

51
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:44,575
Drive carefully.

52
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:17,986
Did Hoffman say anything about living relatives?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,238
A niece living in his hometown.

54
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:23,242
And?

55
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,537
"And?" She's too young to be his legal ward.

56
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:29,832
So the state owns him?
Great.

57
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,294
You know, I still don't understand.

58
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:43,847
No!

59
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:03,953
Kido...

60
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:06,914
It's 4:00 in the morning.

61
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,791
I can't sleep.

62
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:11,085
What is this?
Four nights in a row?

63
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:15,590
You going for a record here?
The seven-year-old insomniac's hall of fame?

64
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:17,634
Do you love me, Rachel?

65
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:22,514
Serious questions tonight.
Of course I love you.

66
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,099
Like a sister?

67
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:27,561
Jamie, sometimes it's...
- Like a real sister?

68
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,357
We're not really sisters, Jamie.

69
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,859
But that doesn't mean that I love you any less.

70
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,366
Sure it does.

71
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,329
I know you miss your parents. 
It hasn't been that long.
- It's been 11 months.

72
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,712
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I 
was your age. I'll bet you didn't know that.

73
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:55,256
You're lucky.
I wish she could do the same for me.

74
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,763
Come on, Jamie.
Let's go back to bed.

75
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,222
Come on, Sunday.

76
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:14,110
Sleep tight.
We'll have French toast for breakfast, ok?

77
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,361
Nighty-night.

78
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:16,656
Come on, Sunday.

79
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:18,532
Nighty-night.

80
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,991
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

81
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:40,328
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul will take.

82
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,957
God bless
Mr. and Mrs. Corruthers.

83
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,877
God bless Rachel, God bless 
Sunday, God bless me.

84
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:50,756
And God bless mommy and 
daddy in heaven. Amen.

85
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:01,123
Help me please!
Somebody help me!

86
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,376
Help me!

87
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,298
Jamie!

88
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:20,353
Oh, dear God!
It's all right, sweetheart.

89
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,358
A bad dream. That's all.
Just a nasty old dream.

90
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,611
I've got you.
You're safe now, see?

91
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,114
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

92
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:34,159
It's okay. Shh.

93
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,246
You're gonna be just fine.
It's okay, baby. You're gonna be fine.

94
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,192
Damn it!
Darlene!

95
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:09,989
There's a clean one in the laundry
room next to your blue slacks. Hello?

96
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,951
Honey, this tie's got a spot on it. I can't 
wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.

97
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:17,412
Hang on, Mrs. Pierce.
Not that tie. On the other side.

98
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,457
That's not the only thing
you're eating, Rachel!

99
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:23,337
Mom, I'm on a diet. 
You want an oinker for a daughter?
- Found it.

100
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,337
Sorry.

101
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:27,300
Do you suppose Susan could 
just bring her crutches?

102
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:31,763
Stupid question.
Tell her I hope she feels better.

103
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:35,726
Susan's mother.
She can't baby-sit tonight.

104
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,601
Why not?

105
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:39,270
Susan broke her ankle 
last night at the ice rink.

106
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:43,901
Rachel?
- Mom, please.

107
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,695
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.

108
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,906
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady.
You know how important that is.

109
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,535
Well. Tonight is very important 
for your father and me.

110
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,497
Can't you find somebody else?
- It's too late.

111
00:12:55,622 --> 00:12:57,249
What am I supposed to tell Brady?

112
00:12:57,374 --> 00:13:01,045
"Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster 
sister. Go and have fun by yourself."

113
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,839
It's not exactly the end of 
the world for goodness' sake.
- Oh, sure it is.

114
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,384
I think tonight Brady was 
ready to make a commitment.

115
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,844
But now, my future relationship
my engagement...

116
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:15,267
my marriage, my children and your grandchildren
have all been wiped out, because I have to baby-sit.

117
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:20,189
I'm sorry I ruined everything.
If I wasn't here, you could go out.

118
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:24,194
Good job, Rachel.

119
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,323
That little girl needs all the love
we can give her right now.

120
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,909
And all you can do is think about yourself?

121
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:38,791
Jamie?

122
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,428
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

123
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:50,764
I can go out with Brady tomorrow night.
It's no big deal.

124
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:54,142
But you wanted to go out tonight.
It's my fault you can't.

125
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,854
Well, tonight we're going to do something better.
We're going to go trick-or-treating.

126
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:59,397
I don't want to.

127
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:04,445
It's Halloween! I mean: don't you want to get dressed up
in a really scary costume and get some candy?

128
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:12,495
How 'bout this afternoon I pick you up
from school and we go get ice cream?

129
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,622
Double scoops?

130
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:18,127
Double scoops.
Now let's get some breakfast.

131
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,926
Dr. Quinn, call 7402.

132
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:39,816
Why wasn't I notified?

133
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:43,112
About what?
- You know damn well about what.

134
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:45,823
You let them take it out of here.

135
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:50,161
For Christ's sake, spare me the speech.
I've listened to it for a decade.

136
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:56,168
The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient and
a federal prisoner. Therefore he's subject to federal law.

137
00:14:56,293 --> 00:15:03,634
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner, Hoffman.
We are talking about an evil on two legs.

138
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:06,262
I can see this is useless.

139
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,890
Do you know what today is?

140
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:11,350
Do you know the date?

141
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:15,354
Every day I look at myself in the mirror and...

142
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,399
And every day I remember.

143
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,693
Look at me... Hoffman!

144
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:22,569
Take a good look!

145
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:29,121
I don't want anyone to have to live
through that night again.

146
00:15:30,788 --> 00:15:34,960
I've said this before.
I think you're the one who needs mental help.

147
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:43,635
Yes? Dr. Hoffman.

148
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,641
I see.

149
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,352
I see. Thank you.

150
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:58,569
Apparently there was an accident
just south of Mill Creek near the bri... Loomis?

151
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,237
Loomis!

152
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:24,805
Is that it?

153
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,765
Yes.
- When did this happen?

154
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,020
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road
in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.

155
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:33,522
An accident?
- Yes, sir.
- Do you believe that?

156
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:34,814
Why shouldn't I?

157
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,775
How many people in the bus?

158
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:38,819
Four... plus Myers.

159
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,536
How many bodies did you find?
- It's hard to tell, they're all chewed up.

160
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,375
Loomis?

161
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,751
It's over. Leave it alone.

162
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:21,657
He's gone.

163
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:23,576
He was here...

164
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,995
...but he's gone.

165
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,788
Did you find any other bodies?

166
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,041
Not yet. There's a lot of ground to cover.
- You won't find him.

167
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,543
He's done all this.

168
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,755
Now he's escaped.
- You don't know that.

169
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:38,133
Michael could've been thrown from the bus.

170
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,053
I've seen bodies thrown 50 - 60 feet from a crash site.

171
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:44,723
Even if by some miracle Michael's conscious...

172
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:50,313
his... his muscles would be totally useless.
Give the troopers a chance to search.

173
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,565
You're talking about him as if he were a human being.

174
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:57,320
That part of him died years ago.

175
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,742
Now where are you going?

176
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,327
Haddonfield.

177
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,368
It's a four hour drive.

178
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:06,831
You can reach me through the local police.

179
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:09,833
If you don't find him in four hours...

180
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,878
I'm sure I will.

181
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,643
Hey Gar. How 'bout a 9/16 socket over here?

182
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:02,640
Hey! Hey there!

183
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:03,807
Hello!

184
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,105
Hello?

185
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,317
Hello?

186
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:52,986
Is anybody here?

187
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,907
Hello?

188
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:03,288
Hello!

189
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:27,731
Is anybody here?

190
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,958
God in heaven.

191
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:06,564
Michael?

192
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,864
Why now?

193
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,787
You waited ten years.

194
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,666
I knew this day would come.

195
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,001
Don't go to Haddonfield.

196
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,924
If you want another victim, take me.

197
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,596
But leave those people in peace.

198
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,017
Please...

199
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,311
Michael.

200
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:45,398
Goddamn you.

201
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,758
Michael!

202
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,803
Hey Jamie!
Where's your costume?

203
00:22:52,053 --> 00:22:56,266
Where's your mask? Or are you wearing it?
- I don't need to wear a stupid costume!

204
00:22:56,391 --> 00:23:01,438
That's because every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.
Right, Jamie? - 'Cause your uncle's the boogeyman.

205
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:05,860
Boogeyman! Boogeyman!
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!

206
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:10,990
How come your mommy
didn't make you a costume, Jamie?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

207
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,326
Jamie's mommy's... a mummy!

208
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,413
Stop it! Okay?
Stop it!

209
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:22,002
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!
- Stop it! Please, stop it!

210
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:26,381
Jamie's an orphan! Jamie's an orphan!

211
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:30,762
Jamie's uncle's the boogeyman!
Jamie's an orphan!

212
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,680
Every day is Halloween at Jamie's house.

213
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:36,811
Boogeyman! Boogeyman! Boogeyman!

214
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:40,815
...didn't make you...?
- How could she? Her mommy's dead.

215
00:23:47,153 --> 00:23:49,572
You're okay, you're okay.

216
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,330
Jamie!

217
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,749
Jamie, are you okay?

218
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:09,261
You remember Lindsey, don't you?

219
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:11,055
Hi Jamie.
- Yeah, hi.

220
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,974
You ready for some ice cream?

221
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,854
I wanna go trick-or-treating...
like the other kids.

222
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,565
But I thought you didn't wanna go trick-or-treating.

223
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:25,529
You know Rach, discount mart's
having a sale on Halloween costumes.

224
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:28,782
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
- I know.

225
00:24:28,907 --> 00:24:29,867
Don't you wanna talk to him?

226
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:32,578
I don't wanna look pushy.
- You won't look pushy.

227
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:34,163
Well, I don't wanna come on too strong.

228
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:37,958
A guy hates a girl that comes on too strong.
Fragile egos, and all of that.

229
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:39,834
You won't come on too strong.

230
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,505
Well, I don't wanna seem desperate or anything.

231
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,883
Face it Rach, you are desperate.

232
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,721
You're just gonna go in and buy a costume for Jamie.
Perfectly legit.

233
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:51,264
I don't know.

234
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,850
Well...

235
00:24:53,017 --> 00:24:55,644
Do I drop you at the discount mart or the Dairy Queen?

236
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:57,729
Jamie?

237
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,776
Discount mart.
Can we get an ice cream after?

238
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:03,987
You bet.

239
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:31,014
Hey, Wade. Why don't you go ahead
and make your move?

240
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:32,602
Don't rush me, Brady.

241
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,437
Timing's gotta be premo.

242
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,608
Yeah well, money talks and bullshit walks.
You know what I mean?

243
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:39,983
Double or nothing, you don't ask Kelly out.

244
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:43,070
All right. Ten bucks.
Let's see it.

245
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:45,823
He's not gonna do it.

246
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:49,243
Chicken. - Don't forget, man.
She's Sheriff Meeker's daughter.

247
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:52,998
Her daddy don't scare me.

248
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:03,134
Fuck off, Wade.

249
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,057
Hey, maybe you can come over right now.

250
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:11,685
Oh, cool!

251
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,618
Call me.
- Okay. Bye.

252
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:31,246
Rachel?

253
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,584
What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to pick you up.

254
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,960
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
- You do?

255
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,255
Okay. Go down to aisle A.
We've got the best costumes in the whole town.

256
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:41,466
Come on, Rachel.
- In a second.

257
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,552
We need to talk.

258
00:26:43,677 --> 00:26:44,803
Okay, sure. What about?

259
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:47,347
About tonight.

260
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:30,769
Rachel! I found the perfect costume.
Come see.

261
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:38,861
What?

262
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:42,782
My parents' baby-sitter's cancelled.
- So?

263
00:27:42,907 --> 00:27:45,326
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

264
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,831
When did you find this out?

265
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:51,207
This morning.
- You found this morning?

266
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:54,252
Why didn't you tell me before?
I mean it's 5 o'clock now, Rachel... shit.

267
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:58,215
Don't get angry.
- I'm not angry. It's just...

268
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:04,054
Can I come over after Jamie goes to sleep?

269
00:28:04,178 --> 00:28:06,516
My parents are gonna come home early tonight.

270
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:07,643
So?

271
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,771
I don't know, Brady.

272
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:13,607
Okay.

273
00:28:14,065 --> 00:28:15,526
I guess, I'll call you later.

274
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,188
Jamie, what happened?

275
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,398
It was the nightmare man.

276
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:55,276
What?

277
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,114
He's come to get me, Rachel.
- You're okay.

278
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,533
You probably saw a mask and it scared you.

279
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,493
At least you're not cut.

280
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,912
Come on. Let's go home.

281
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,329
You gonna be okay?

282
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:07,707
She'll be fine

283
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,998
Come on, old man.
Let's go!

284
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:51,797
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

285
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:07,021
Get it in here, old man.

286
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:11,650
I ain't got till Judgment Day!

287
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:19,742
Thank you.

288
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,163
Anything for a fellow pilgrim.

289
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,541
We're all on a quest.
Sometimes we need help getting where we wanna be.

290
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,089
Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumont county.

291
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:34,006
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

292
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:35,966
How far you're going, Mr. Sayer?

293
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,596
God's country, Promised Land.

294
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:41,057
Where you heading, Mr. ah...

295
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:42,643
Loomis.

296
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,602
Haddonfield.

297
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,186
Car trouble?

298
00:30:47,564 --> 00:30:48,690
Sort of.

299
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,778
You're hunting it, ain't ya?

300
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,280
Yeah, you're hunting it, all right.

301
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:57,700
Just like me.

302
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,286
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?

303
00:31:00,411 --> 00:31:04,080
Apocalypse, end of the world. Armageddon.

304
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:06,626
It's always got a face and a name.

305
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:12,842
I've been hunting the bastard 
for 30 years, give or take.

306
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,884
Come close a time or two.

307
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:17,220
Too damn close!

308
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,852
You can't kill damnation, mister.

309
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:26,188
It don't die like a man dies.

310
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:29,192
I know that, Mr. Sayer.

311
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:33,113
Oh, you're a pilgrim, all right!

312
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:35,823
I saw it on your face
back there in the dust.

313
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:40,537
I saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes.
Would you like a drink?

314
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:48,087
♪ Yes, we'll gather at the river ♪

315
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:53,176
♪ The beautiful, beautiful river ♪

316
00:31:53,301 --> 00:31:57,680
♪ Gather with the saints at the river ♪

317
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,287
Okay Jamie, we're leaving.

318
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,082
Where's Rach?
- I don't know.

319
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,251
Here I am.

320
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:23,376
Come on, hon.

321
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,294
How do we look?

322
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:27,629
You guys always look great.

323
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:28,923
We'll be at the Fallbrooks.

324
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:34,803
The number's next to the phone. I know, and next to that
is Police, hospital, fire and probably the National Guard.

325
00:32:35,262 --> 00:32:37,932
I want you two to have fun tonight.
Make sure Jamie's in bed by 9:30.

326
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,059
You're gonna be late.
You don't wanna blow your promotion.

327
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:43,981
Don't make fun. Tonight is the difference
between vacations in Bermuda...

328
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:47,192
...or spending another two weeks
with your grandmother in Cleveland. So hurry up.

329
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:47,900
Bye.

330
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:49,861
See ya.
- Good luck, dad.

331
00:32:51,739 --> 00:32:55,118
Rachel?... Can I get my costume on?
- Yeah. Hurry up.

332
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:56,118
Okay.

333
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:14,764
Is Brady there?

334
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:17,182
He's not back from work yet?

335
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:19,059
Okay.

336
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:23,232
Well, when he comes in, could you tell him
to drop by about eight? I should be home by then.

337
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,942
This is Rachel.

338
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:26,067
Okay.

339
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,234
Bye.

340
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,866
Come on, Jamie.
You're gonna miss all the good candy.

341
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,872
Come on, Jamie!

342
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:49,717
Come on, Rachel!

343
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:50,802
Coming.

344
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:53,346
I thought you said you were ready.
- I'm ready! I'm ready!

345
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:55,098
Okay, let's go.

346
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,480
Ah, I need to speak with Sheriff Brackett.

347
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:45,611
Then you'll have to travel
about 3,000 miles south of here.

348
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:46,486
What?

349
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:48,738
Brackett retired. Back in '81.

350
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:50,699
He moved to St. Petersburg.

351
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:53,912
Oh, Well, who's the new Sheriff?
- I am.

352
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:55,622
Ben Meeker.

353
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:59,584
Oh, Sheriff Meeker...
my name is Dr. ...
- Loomis.

354
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:02,463
Folks around here aren't
likely to forget your face.

355
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:04,465
At least not cops.

356
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,425
So, what brings you back here after ten years?

357
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:11,139
Michael Myers... has escaped from Ridgemont.
He's here in Haddonfield.

358
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:16,477
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
- He's here, Sheriff.

359
00:35:17,311 --> 00:35:18,270
Why?

360
00:35:18,521 --> 00:35:19,981
Ten years ago...

361
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:22,735
He tried to kill Laurie Strode.

362
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,363
Now he wants her daughter.

363
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:28,948
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
- Wherever she is, that little child is in mortal danger.

364
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:38,333
Myers has been locked up since before she was born.
He's never laid eyes on her.

365
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:43,006
Six bodies... Sheriff! That's what I've seen
between here and Ridgemont.

366
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:45,510
A filling station in flames!

367
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:49,012
I tell you, Michael Myers is here in this town!

368
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:53,059
He's here to kill that little girl
and anybody who gets in his way.

369
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:58,981
All right, Pierce, call the troopers and check his story out.

370
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:04,404
And assuming what you say is true.
- It's true, Sheriff! - All right, all right. It's true.

371
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,533
What the hell can we do
to avoid a repeat of ten years ago?

372
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:08,742
Find this little girl.

373
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,745
Get her someplace safe.
Call the local TV station.

374
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,081
Tell them to get people off the streets
and behind locked doors.

375
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,959
Can't get long distance, Sheriff.

376
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:18,920
Operator says the lines are down.

377
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:24,092
All right, let's go.

378
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,886
When he makes that call...

379
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:27,970
All right, Pierce, do it.

380
00:36:28,095 --> 00:36:30,180
Let's check on this little girl.

381
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:33,018
Thanks.

382
00:36:35,229 --> 00:36:38,441
Jamie, wait for me.
- This is great, Rachel. Come on!

383
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:52,997
Trick-or-treat.
- Oh, my, what a scary little clown.

384
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:55,249
Let's see what I have for you.
There you are, sweetheart.

385
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,753
Thank you.
- You're welcome, honey.

386
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:03,218
Had enough? - No way. Halloween's great.
Can we stay out all night?

387
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:05,344
Forget it, kiddo.
We're home by eight o'clock.

388
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:18,066
That clown costume is really cool!
- Really?

389
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,025
Yeah.

390
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,527
Hey, you wanna go with us?

391
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,239
Go ahead.

392
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:25,033
Come on.

393
00:37:25,158 --> 00:37:26,744
Come on, come on. Let's go up there.

394
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,953
Come on. Let's go!

395
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:37,670
Trick-or-treat!

396
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:39,214
Hi Rachel.

397
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:40,632
Hi.

398
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:43,887
Here you go, you little monster.

399
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,556
Thank you.
- You little clown. - Thank you.

400
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:50,058
There you go.
- Thank you. Trick-or-treat.

401
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,145
Bye.

402
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,437
Rachel!

403
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,987
Rachel! - Brady!
- Just a second.

404
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,950
Rachel... I got an expla... Rachel I...

405
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:08,996
I got an explanation.
- You don't owe me anything, Brady. No explanation.

406
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,789
Will you just hold on a second?

407
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,458
Just leave me alone and let's forget it.

408
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,211
No, you don't understand.

409
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,674
I mean you blew off our date at the last minute.
- So you hop onto the next best thing?

410
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,221
I thought you were different from other guys.
- I'm different. It's just that...

411
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:29,060
I just got pissed off... that's all.
- Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back
to little Ms. Hot Panties.

412
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:30,937
Rachel!
- Jamie?

413
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:34,732
Brady?

414
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,568
Are you coming in or what?

415
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:50,583
Jamie!

416
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,336
Jamie!

417
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:59,509
Great, Rachel ... just great.

418
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:05,598
By order of the Sheriff's Office, all citizens of Haddonfield
are asked to clear the streets.

419
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:08,228
I made that payment nine days ago
and still have nothing...
- You were right.

420
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,147
Everybody, shut up a Goddamn minute!

421
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:12,481
Shut up!
All businesses are asked to close as soon as possible.

422
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:18,195
What's that shit about, Earl?
Stay tuned to the station for updates.

423
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,697
Not like ol' Ben Meeker do something like that.

424
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:21,990
Sure ain't.

425
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:26,496
Martians could land on Ben's doorstep
and all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shotgun.

426
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:29,124
Who are you calling?
- Police station.

427
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:31,708
Ain't closing down without a good Goddamn reason.

428
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:35,338
Well?

429
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:39,135
Just rings.

430
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:50,021
Well, come on!

431
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:55,319
Jackie, watch the register for me, hon.
- You got it, Earl.

432
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:56,527
What's going down?

433
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,447
Where are we going, Earl?
- We're going to Ben's.

434
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:03,034
The phone never just rings at a Police station,
no way, no how.
- Wake up the Sheriff.

435
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:06,414
Load it up. Come on, come on.

436
00:40:54,256 --> 00:40:55,258
Something?

437
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,760
He's been here.
- How do you know?

438
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,726
This is starting to spook me, doc.

439
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,687
At least I'm not alone.

440
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,862
Logan... I want you to stay here
in case the family gets back. - Right here, Ben.

441
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:17,990
You look sharp. You understand?
- No problem, Sheriff.

442
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,054
Hey, you!

443
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:40,432
This is city property.

444
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,435
No trespassing.

445
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,353
What are you, deaf?

446
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,192
Don't try that Halloween shit with me.

447
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,948
All right, I'm on the telephone to the Police right now.

448
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:58,867
Don't you even think about leaving.

449
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,794
Yeah! That was a fun!

450
00:42:53,677 --> 00:42:56,054
Come on, kids, we're going in the car right now.

451
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,268
Come on. I said move in, get in there.

452
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:04,896
Jamie!

453
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:24,168
Jamie!

454
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:55,076
Rachel, is that you?

455
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:57,537
Is that you?

456
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:07,128
Jamie?

457
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:10,342
Jamie?

458
00:44:18,934 --> 00:44:20,102
Jamie?

459
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:27,735
Jamie?

460
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:56,683
Oh, God!

461
00:45:06,778 --> 00:45:08,028
Jamie.

462
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,298
Whoever you are...

463
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,176
I have a big dog with me and he bites!

464
00:45:32,765 --> 00:45:34,059
Jamie!

465
00:45:36,853 --> 00:45:38,604
Where have you been?

466
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:42,190
Don't ever go off on your own at night again.
Okay? Not ever.

467
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:55,957
Rachel, Jamie, thank God!
- What's going on? - Get in the car.

468
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:57,499
Come on, quick.

469
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:11,473
Is that him?

470
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:13,267
Is that him!?

471
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:14,601
Yes.

472
00:46:17,228 --> 00:46:18,145
Loomis.

473
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:26,155
Oh, Christ. Doc.

474
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:30,409
Dear God.

475
00:46:36,082 --> 00:46:37,416
Hey, don't shoot!

476
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,629
Oh, that was great!
You thought it was me, didn't you?

477
00:46:41,754 --> 00:46:44,842
Sheriff!
- Get home, damn it!

478
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:46,176
There's a curfew!

479
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:48,846
I catch your ass, it'll be a weekend in jail!

480
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:51,472
You all right, doc?

481
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:55,353
Come on. We'll get to the station.
We'll get these kids safe.

482
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:58,106
It's okay.

483
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:02,985
Station, this is 132.
come in, pierce.

484
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,405
Come in, Pierce.

485
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,948
Come in, Pierce.

486
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,045
Oh, Christ!

487
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,259
Wouldn't have given up without a fight.

488
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,345
They didn't know, what they were fighting.

489
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,416
How can a man do this, Loomis?
Tell me.

490
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,375
It isn't a man.

491
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,212
What is he?

492
00:47:58,921 --> 00:47:59,963
Tell me!

493
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:02,048
What the hell are we dealing with?

494
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,259
Evil.

495
00:48:21,987 --> 00:48:23,572
What the Sam Hill is going on?

496
00:48:23,697 --> 00:48:27,702
Go on home, Earl. This is Police business.
- What the hell did this?

497
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,371
Looks like to me you're out of business.
Now I want some answers.

498
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:34,543
I haven't got the time or the patience to argue with you.
Now go home to your families where you belong.

499
00:48:37,254 --> 00:48:41,716
It was Michael Myers.
He's come home to kill.

500
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,095
Let it be, Earl.

501
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:46,221
Let the Police handle it.

502
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:48,349
Like the last time?

503
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:51,142
How many people killed back then?
How many kids?

504
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:53,687
Al here, lost his boy ten years back.

505
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:57,151
Well not this time, Ben.
I'll handle this my own way.

506
00:48:58,027 --> 00:49:00,028
We're gonna fry his ass.

507
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:07,828
You son of a bitch! You just created a lynch mob.
- You haven't got a Police force!

508
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,205
These men may be the only defense you've got.

509
00:49:11,538 --> 00:49:14,127
Ok, let's move it up.
- Come on guys, let's go.

510
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,548
Let's hunt this bastard!
- God help us.

511
00:49:31,353 --> 00:49:34,314
132, 132, this is 134, over.

512
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:38,320
This is 132, over.
- Ben - uh...

513
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:40,612
I just heard about the station.

514
00:49:40,988 --> 00:49:45,702
Now you go over to my house
and we'll call the state boys from there.
- I'll be there in five minutes.

515
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:09,478
Honey, I don't think they're home.
- How do you know they are not home?

516
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:11,021
'Cause the lights are all out.

517
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:14,107
I told them to be here by 9:30. It's not 9:30 yet.
- Come on, let's call the Carters.

518
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:15,859
Come on, come on.
- You call the Carters.

519
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:18,112
Kids?
Rachel? Jamie?

520
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:28,540
There he is!

521
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:35,381
I've seen his face.

522
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,133
Right there, Al

523
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,844
Right there in the bushes.

524
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:15,839
Come on.

525
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,643
Shit, Earl!

526
00:51:25,768 --> 00:51:27,520
It's Ted Hollister.

527
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:32,274
You dumb son of a bitch.

528
00:51:32,441 --> 00:51:34,693
You said, you saw Myers.

529
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:50,753
Let's go upstairs.
- Huh?

530
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,755
No.

531
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:54,173
I think we're doing just fine right here.

532
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:06,520
Oh, I think I'm in heaven!

533
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:35,925
Oh, Brady. Oh, Brady.

534
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:43,602
Oh, shit.

535
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:47,105
Oh, it's my dad!
- Your dad? Your dad!

536
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,118
God, if he catches us like this...

537
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:00,369
...he's gonna skin you alive.

538
00:53:00,494 --> 00:53:01,704
- What?
- for starters.

539
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:02,998
Oh, no.

540
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,376
Come on!
- I'm going. I'm going.

541
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:09,839
Where's that deputy?
- He'll be here in a minute.

542
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:27,147
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.

543
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,317
Dad, what's going on?

544
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:33,406
Kelly, I want you to close
and lock all the downstairs windows.
- Why? - Just do it!

545
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:37,909
Where's the radio?
- Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.

546
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:40,745
Brady, you know how to use a gun?

547
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:42,289
Yes, sir.

548
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,630
Think you can handle that?
- Um, yeah. You wanna tell me what's happening?

549
00:53:48,755 --> 00:53:52,466
Yeah, when I have time. You got your riot gun?
- In the trunk of my squad. - Go get it.

550
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,054
Take these.

551
00:53:58,474 --> 00:54:02,604
Okay, you got a hammer and roofing nails.
And I want you up in the attic securing it,
so nobody can get in.

552
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:07,108
You know, if something's happening,
I should just go call my parents.
- Just get up in the attic.

553
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:08,609
Oh yeah.

554
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:10,486
I catch you groping my daughter...

555
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:12,530
I'll use that shotgun on you.

556
00:54:12,656 --> 00:54:14,115
You understand?

557
00:54:41,687 --> 00:54:43,939
Now get the outside shutters.
- What are we doing?

558
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:46,358
Making sure that no one can get in here.

559
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:48,985
Isn't all this a little paranoid?

560
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:52,741
If you'd seen that Police station,
you wouldn't even ask.

561
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:00,540
You two okay?

562
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,459
We've been better.

563
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:04,754
What's going on?

564
00:55:05,795 --> 00:55:07,547
Michael Myers.

565
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:08,840
Who's that?

566
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:10,592
Ten years ago...

567
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:12,051
Halloween.

568
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:14,973
He's Jamie's uncle.

569
00:55:16,307 --> 00:55:18,184
The kids at school were right.

570
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,482
I'm gonna be outside...
upstairs in the attic.

571
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,173
That's all the windows, dad.

572
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,760
All right. Good, good.
Logan, I want you right here by the front door, ok?

573
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,762
This is the dead bolt key.

574
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,476
All right,

575
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:36,809
We're secure.

576
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,357
I now padlocked the back door.
This is the only way in and out of this house.

577
00:56:41,482 --> 00:56:44,318
You got that?
- You got it, Ben.

578
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,655
I want you to go make us some coffee.
- All right.

579
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:52,702
Ah, shit!

580
00:57:07,093 --> 00:57:08,011
Hello?

581
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:14,183
Who's there?

582
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,700
Can we go home soon, Rachel?

583
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:32,495
Real soon, Jamie.

584
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,538
Now, shh.

585
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:37,042
How's it powered?

586
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:41,838
Batteries. I'd planned a generator
for the house next week. I wish I hadn't waited.

587
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:49,846
This is squawk 79-o-zero Haddonfield broadcasting
on a State Police emergency frequency.
Can anyone hear me?

588
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,475
Can anyone hear me?

589
00:57:54,185 --> 00:57:55,102
Damn it!

590
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,234
Everything all right?

591
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,944
Jamie's sleeping.

592
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,199
When can we go home?

593
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:26,284
State Police will be here soon.

594
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:28,078
Not long after that.

595
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:30,163
Don't worry.

596
00:59:31,122 --> 00:59:32,624
I'm trying.

597
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,127
It won't be long.

598
00:59:46,638 --> 00:59:47,641
I hear someone.

599
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:51,434
Hello, this is Frank Bute over in Tuckerville.
You got some kind of emergency? Over.

600
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,772
Thank Christ. This is Ben Meeker,
Sheriff over in Haddonfield.

601
00:59:54,897 --> 00:59:58,861
Our phone and power lines are down
and we have a killer running loose in the street.

602
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,572
Michael Myers.
- Is this some kind of Halloween prank?

603
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:04,533
This is no joke.

604
01:00:04,659 --> 01:00:06,744
We need those troopers and we need 'em now.

605
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,372
All right, I'll get the troopers right away.

606
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,960
Hang on. I'll need some information.
- We're not going anywhere, Mr. Bute.

607
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:24,555
Rachel...

608
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:26,890
...is your sister all right?

609
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:28,851
She's fine.

610
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:31,395
Good.

611
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:36,818
Sheriff's radioed for help. They'll be here soon.

612
01:00:37,026 --> 01:00:38,528
Hell of a night.

613
01:00:38,986 --> 01:00:40,238
It's not over yet.

614
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,532
Where you going?

615
01:00:44,283 --> 01:00:45,494
The Corruthers' house.

616
01:00:45,618 --> 01:00:48,415
That's where Jamie lives. That's where he'll go.

617
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,208
Leave Myers for the State boys.

618
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:52,876
The State Police won't know how to stop him.

619
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:53,960
Do you?

620
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:57,548
It might be nobody knows how to stop him.

621
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,842
But I've got to try.

622
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:14,649
Are you looking for this?

623
01:01:22,408 --> 01:01:25,119
I didn't know you and Brady had anything, okay?

624
01:01:25,244 --> 01:01:26,371
You knew.

625
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:29,082
You just didn't care!

626
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,291
He's not married.

627
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:34,880
Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.

628
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:37,425
Don't you mean, what you do best?

629
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,764
Wise up to what men want, Rachel.

630
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:48,269
Or Brady won't be the last man
you lose to another woman.

631
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:55,026
Have some coffee.

632
01:01:55,694 --> 01:01:58,656
Over Alan Gateway shot Ted Hallister by mistake.

633
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,577
Well, is he dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

634
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:05,621
Oh, Christ. 04 out there?
This is Ben Meeker.

635
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:08,166
Answer me, damn it.

636
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:10,669
Sheriff, what is going on out there?

637
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:14,423
Yeah, I'll swing by with you get my brother John
maybe with couple of buddies over there.

638
01:02:14,548 --> 01:02:16,634
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio.

639
01:02:16,759 --> 01:02:19,094
The State boys will send word once they're in route.

640
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,428
When that word comes...

641
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,513
...you go tell deputy Logan.
- Okay.

642
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,850
Now, you understand?
- Uh huh.

643
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:28,355
...pick me up in ten minutes.
We'll find out what's happening.

644
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:33,277
You know where the hell Earl's at?

645
01:02:33,736 --> 01:02:35,820
No, I haven't heard from him in a while.

646
01:02:35,945 --> 01:02:40,409
I'll get Alan Gateway.
I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
- Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.

647
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:43,619
Hey, I got a town full of beer bellies
running around in the dark with shotguns.

648
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:45,330
Who's gonna be next!?

649
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:47,625
Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?

650
01:02:49,879 --> 01:02:51,630
I can't stand by for that.

651
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:09,899
Rachel?

652
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,153
I thought you might like some coffee.

653
01:03:58,492 --> 01:04:00,453
It's pretty boring out here.

654
01:04:04,956 --> 01:04:06,834
I wish they'd fix the power.

655
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:12,133
At least we'd have some ...
MTV while we wait for the cavalry.

656
01:04:42,872 --> 01:04:46,418
Haddonfield, we should have cars
dispatched in five minutes.

657
01:04:46,543 --> 01:04:49,297
ETA 35 minutes. Over.

658
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,011
Uh... okay.

659
01:04:54,342 --> 01:04:56,094
Great. We'll be waiting.

660
01:04:56,305 --> 01:04:58,182
Ah ten-four. Over.

661
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,561
Uh... over and out.

662
01:05:20,497 --> 01:05:22,208
Deputy Logan.

663
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:27,880
Deputy?

664
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:48,068
Jamie!

665
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,323
Oh, God.

666
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,704
Oh, God.

667
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:03,669
What's going on?

668
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,005
I've gotta find Jamie.
- No, no. What we've gotta do is get out of here...

669
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,633
...right now.
- Not without Jamie! - Look!

670
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:13,972
Do you think she stands a chance?
- She's not dead! - No.

671
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:20,812
Is there another key?
- I don't know!

672
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:22,605
Get out of the way, get out of the way.

673
01:06:25,942 --> 01:06:27,736
It's metal! Goddammit, it's metal!

674
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,445
What does that mean?

675
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:31,866
We're trapped in this house.

676
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:40,040
Jamie!
- Oh, Rachel!

677
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:42,545
Rachel ...

678
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:46,548
Brady!

679
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:47,591
Get back!

680
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:51,178
Brady!
- No.

681
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:55,724
Son of a bitch!
Shit!

682
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:58,226
Brady, come with us!
- Go!

683
01:06:58,852 --> 01:06:59,937
Brady!

684
01:07:00,438 --> 01:07:02,357
Get up there, Rachel!

685
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:04,235
Shit!

686
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:05,819
Brady!

687
01:07:05,945 --> 01:07:07,278
Get up there, Rachel!

688
01:07:07,404 --> 01:07:09,822
Brady, come with us!
- Go! - No, Brady!

689
01:07:14,746 --> 01:07:15,913
Go!

690
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:18,540
Shit.

691
01:07:23,504 --> 01:07:26,673
Rachel, come on! Come on!
- No! I wanna help!

692
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,065
Brady!
- Rachel, come on!

693
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:09,928
Leave us alone!
God, leave us alone!

694
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:14,976
Jamie!

695
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:33,496
Go! Go!

696
01:08:42,423 --> 01:08:43,548
Rachel!

697
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:52,977
Jamie, get down.

698
01:08:53,435 --> 01:08:54,603
Get down!

699
01:09:00,191 --> 01:09:01,567
Get on my back, Jamie!
Hold on.

700
01:09:01,735 --> 01:09:02,610
Get on.

701
01:09:02,778 --> 01:09:03,612
Hold on.

702
01:09:18,211 --> 01:09:19,128
Hold on...

703
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:49,494
Grab on, Jamie.

704
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:52,330
Grab on.

705
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:30,872
I want you to get down to the chimney, Jamie.
- I can't! - Well, try. Damn it!

706
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:34,460
Rachel!

707
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:51,017
I'm gonna lower you down, Jamie.

708
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:52,144
Okay?

709
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,440
Rachel?
- I've got you. Come on.

710
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:55,733
Go down now.

711
01:10:56,024 --> 01:10:58,028
Rachel.
- I've got you, Jamie.

712
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:05,200
I've got you, I've got you!

713
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:42,407
Oh, come alive, Rachel! Please, come alive!
Don't be dead! You can't be dead!

714
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:45,327
Come alive, Rachel!

715
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,098
Help!

716
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:07,393
Somebody help me!

717
01:12:07,518 --> 01:12:09,436
Please!

718
01:12:09,812 --> 01:12:11,270
Help me!

719
01:12:11,563 --> 01:12:13,022
Please!

720
01:12:13,147 --> 01:12:14,608
Help me!

721
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:17,820
Please!
Somebody help me!

722
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:52,022
What are you doing out here alone?
- Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home!
- No. No, you can't.

723
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:55,235
I've just been there.
That's the first place he'll look for you.

724
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:57,697
Where's the schoolhouse?

725
01:12:58,198 --> 01:12:59,741
The schoolhouse.

726
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:03,911
Where's the schoolhouse?
- It's over there. - Come on.

727
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,082
Come.
We'll be safe there.

728
01:13:26,894 --> 01:13:27,770
Here.

729
01:13:42,077 --> 01:13:44,287
We'll hear some sirens soon.

730
01:13:44,495 --> 01:13:47,459
Then we'll be safe?
- Yes.

731
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,086
You don't believe that, do you?

732
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,838
No.

733
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:04,684
No.

734
01:14:06,561 --> 01:14:09,107
No!
Oh, please!

735
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,818
Somebody help me!

736
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:13,818
No!

737
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:37,867
In the school!
Pull over, Earl.

738
01:15:46,878 --> 01:15:49,381
What's going on here? We heard the alarm.
- He's inside!

739
01:15:49,505 --> 01:15:51,716
Jesus. Where?
- In the school!

740
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:58,306
Let's get this bastard!

741
01:15:58,432 --> 01:15:59,601
No!

742
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:01,144
He'll kill you too.

743
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:04,188
We have to get out of Haddonfield
the State Police are on their way. Let them handle it.

744
01:16:04,313 --> 01:16:07,651
I don't know about you Earl, but that makes sense to me.
Let's get the hell out!

745
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:11,529
He's not our patient. Let the troopers have it.
That's what they get paid for.

746
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:14,740
Screw it. Let's get out of here.
Al.

747
01:16:47,275 --> 01:16:48,736
Okay, everybody, listen up.

748
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:51,532
I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck.

749
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:52,824
I'm taking them out of town...

750
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:56,202
...route 410. State Police are on the way.

751
01:16:56,869 --> 01:16:58,831
You got that?
- Got it, Earl.
- Okay, out.

752
01:17:14,347 --> 01:17:15,889
There's the cavalry.

753
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:35,744
Coming out of Haddonfield?
- Yeah. Myers is in the elementary school.
We're taking these kids to safety.

754
01:17:35,869 --> 01:17:38,998
Okay, there's a highway patrol substation
about four miles down the highway.

755
01:17:39,123 --> 01:17:40,501
You'll see the turnoff signs.

756
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:43,421
There we've got officers on duty.
They'll take care of you.

757
01:17:43,546 --> 01:17:44,380
Thanks.

758
01:17:53,848 --> 01:17:54,931
It's gonna be okay.

759
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:47,762
Jamie!

760
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:26,345
Die...

761
01:20:26,637 --> 01:20:29,931
you... son of a bitch!

762
01:21:06,305 --> 01:21:08,933
Jamie, I want you to stay right here in the truck!

763
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,949
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
- Calm down, calm down. Are you all right?

764
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:26,785
Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. - Where's Jamie?

765
01:21:33,249 --> 01:21:34,209
Jamie!

766
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:37,087
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

767
01:21:44,554 --> 01:21:45,847
Get down!

768
01:22:36,192 --> 01:22:37,319
Oh, babies!

769
01:22:46,579 --> 01:22:48,373
It's over.
- Yes.

770
01:22:49,666 --> 01:22:51,667
Michael Myers is in hell...

771
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:52,918
buried...

772
01:22:53,043 --> 01:22:54,503
Where he belongs.

773
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,591
These kids aren't likely to forget.

774
01:22:58,716 --> 01:23:00,926
They've survived this ordeal,

775
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,014
they'll survive it's memory.

776
01:23:04,139 --> 01:23:06,725
I'm going to take Jamie upstairs.

777
01:23:07,476 --> 01:23:09,312
Stay with Rachel.

778
01:23:09,438 --> 01:23:10,521
Come on, honey.

779
01:24:12,879 --> 01:24:14,756
No.

780
01:24:15,257 --> 01:24:16,717
No!

781
01:24:17,425 --> 01:24:18,803
No!

782
01:24:19,553 --> 01:24:29,649
No! No! No! No!
No! No!

783
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,240
No.
