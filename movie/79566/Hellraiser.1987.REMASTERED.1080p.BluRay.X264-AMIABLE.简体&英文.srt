1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,030
你想要什么呢？科顿先生
What's your pleasure, Mr. Cotton?

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,630
盒子
The box.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,020
拿着吧,这是你的
Take it, it's yours.

9
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,510
他永远属于你
It always was.

10
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,790
这就是其中的一处房产
It's gotta be one of these.

11
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,630
我都快冻死了
I'm going to freeze to death.

12
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,990
- 好了 好了 - 也许有人把锁换了．
-Okay, okay. -Well, maybe somebody changed the lock.

13
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,510
谁？是谁把锁换掉了呢？
Like who? Who's gonna change this lock?

14
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,740
噢,我也不知道. 我只是瞎猜的
Well, I don't know. It was just a suggestion.

15
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,190
噢,成了
Ah. Success.

16
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,350
瞧
Voila.

17
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,870
对了,就是这里
Well, this is it--

18
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,070
我家的旧家产
the old homestead.

19
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,870
噢,很潮湿的味道
Yuck. It smells damp.

20
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,740
对了,它已经.... 空了很长一段时间了 不是吗？
Well, it's... been empty for a while, hasn't it?

21
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,830
但很快可以使它热闹起来
But we'll soon warm it up

22
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,150
使它有家的感觉
and get it feeling like a home.

23
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,150
你在这儿呆了多久呢？
How long since you were here?

24
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,750
噢,最美好的十年,在此度过
Oh, the better part of 10 years.

25
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,070
我前妻去世后, 我想把它卖掉
I wanted to sell it after the old lady died,

26
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,190
但我弟弟弗兰克不同意.
but I couldn't get Frank to agree.

27
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,110
我想他需要个 避风港之类的地方
I guess he needed a hideout or something.

28
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,470
你能来看看这个吗？
Would you look at this?

29
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,230
别担心
And don't worry,

30
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,700
对我来说这些没有半点意义
this stuff means nothing to me.

31
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,190
已是过去了
It all goes.

32
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,620
我想半数家产属于你兄弟的吧
I thought half of it was your brother's.

33
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,710
他只知道浪费光阴 真是不成才, 另外...
I've never known him to kick cash out of bed. Besides...

34
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,410
他可能正在什么酒吧大醉酩酊呢
he's probably behind bars someplace.

35
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,980
你得知道
You know...

36
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,190
在我们对它整理前, 得让克里斯蒂看看这个地方
we have to let Kirsty see this place before we do a thing to it.

37
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,150
她会喜欢
She'll love it.

38
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,030
你真的想搬到这儿来吗？
You really want to move in here?

39
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,510
你不喜欢它吗？
You don't like it?

40
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,310
我想这比布鲁克林好多了
I suppose it's better than Brooklyn.

41
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,950
噢,别开始,朱莉娅.
Oh, don't start, Julia.

42
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,500
- 什么别开始？ - 听着
-Don't start what? -Look.

43
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,670
我们可以在这儿住下来
We can make it work here.

44
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,390
我的事业做得很出色. 你可以做点自己喜欢的事
Now I've got a terrific job, you're back on your own turf--

45
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,550
我们会很幸福.
we can be happy.

46
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,310
- 好了 好了 - 那吵什么呢？
-All right, all right. -So what's the argument?

47
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,020
- 没有争吵啊 - 噢 我的上帝．
-No argument. -Oh, Christ!

48
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,710
亲爱的
Honey...

49
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,870
他妈的
Shit.

50
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,510
拉里. 拉里
Larry! Larry!

51
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,150
- 你在哪儿呢？ - 在这儿
-Where are you? -In here.

52
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,710
有人在这儿住过吗？
Squatters?

53
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,270
是弗兰克.
Frank.

54
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,150
- 他在这儿住吗？ - 噢 他以前曾在过这儿
-He's here? -Well, he's been here.

55
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,710
我是说我看见厨房里还留着些 他的稀奇古怪的东西
I mean, there's stuff in the kitchen you wouldn't believe.

56
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,430
很明显,他又跑掉了
He's obviously made one of his famous getaways.

57
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,310
会是谁的电话呢？
What the hell is that?

58
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,340
是谁？
-Who is this?

59
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,030
爸爸吗？
Dad.

60
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,020
克里斯蒂!
Kirsty!

61
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,390
我成功了
I got through.

62
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,640
你在哪儿呢？
Barely. Where are you?

63
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,950
我找到了房子．
I found a room.

64
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,030
- 你说什么？ - 我说 我找到了房子住
-You what? -I said, I found a room.

65
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,210
等等,我以为你暂时 会跟我们住一起
Wait, I thought you were going to stay with us for a while

66
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:35,870
爸爸
Dad.

67
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,550
你会喜欢这所房子.
Well, you'd like this house.

68
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,750
你会喜欢我的房子的
You'd like my room.

69
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,580
我真的很想让你来 看看这房子.真的很棒
I'd really like you to see this house. It's something else.

70
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,990
也许在接下来的几天中 我会找份工作
Maybe in the next couple of days. I gotta find myself a job.

71
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,830
为什么呢？甜心
What for, sweetie?

72
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,910
我说你架子摆够了吧, 没必要这样
Look, you've already made the gesture, there's no need--

73
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,790
爸,不是摆架子, 这是我必须做的事情
Dad, this isn't a gesture. This is something I need to do.

74
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,350
稍微信任我一下吧,好吗？
Come on and trust me a little, okay?

75
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,830
明天给我回电话 我会的,我会去见你
-Call me tomorrow. -I will. I'll see you.

76
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,150
再见了,爸爸
Bye, Dad.

77
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,300
你觉得怎么样？
So?

78
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,510
为什么不搬进来呢？
Why not?

79
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,310
太棒了.
Great.

80
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,670
我们会在周日搬进来
We'll move in on Sunday.

81
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,470
听着,通过这个地方时 不能碰坏了它的表面
Listen, look out for the moulding on the way through here.

82
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,990
- 好的 - 好的
- All right. - All right.

83
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,670
- 你能向后拉下吗？ - 当然
- Are you all right back there? -Yeah yeah.

84
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,780
对.好了.直接把它搬到楼上去
All right, okay. Now just take it straight up the stairs.

85
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,750
别担心.可以通过去
Don't worry, it'll get through.

86

当心
-(Man)Watch it. -(Larry)Oh.

89
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,230
我们休息一下吧,伙计们
Let's take five, guys.

90
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,550
你那儿收拾的怎么样了？
How's things in there?

91
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,500
房间里像掉进了炸弹一样乱七八糟
Looks like a bomb dropped.

92
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,250
有啤酒吗？
You got any beer?

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,990
为什么不拿些啤酒来喝呢？
why don't I get it?

96
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,910
对我来说,没有比这更爽的事儿了
I've got nothing better to do.

97
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,320

This is a big house.

105
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,940

107
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,790
如果我们能把这该死的床搬过去 我愿意带你参观一番
Ill give you the grand tour if we ever get this goddamn bed moved.

108
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,260
- 朱莉娅在这儿吗？ - 她在楼上
-Is Julia here? -She's upstairs.

- 她讨厌搬家． - 真让人惊讶

你们继续做这累人的活儿吧
You get on with the grunt work

113

- 我得喝点儿咖啡． - 好主意

116
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,830
那是你女儿吗？
-Is that your daughter? -Uh-huh.

117
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,590
- 很像她妈妈． - 她妈妈已经过世了
-Got her mother's looks. -Her mother's dead.

118

拜托！
Come on.

119
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,430
噢 该死
Oh, shit.

克里斯蒂！
Kirsty.

135
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,830
浴室里有一条
There's one in the bathroom.

136
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,620
顺便说一句 爸爸有没有告诉你 我已经找到房子了呢？
Oh, by the way, did Daddy tell you I got a room?

137
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,320
房间不大,但挺好.
It's not that big, but it's okay.

138
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,580
朱莉娅
Julia?

139
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,270
朱莉娅
Julia?

140
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,150
我们喝点什么呢？
What shall we drink to?

141
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,950
结婚幸福么？
Wedded bliss?

142
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,790
我很幸福.
I'm very happy

143
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,190
噢,我相信
I'm sure you are.

144
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,310
你得让我吻新娘子
You're gonna let me kiss the bride?

145
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
拉里怎么办呢？
What about Larry?

146
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
忘了他
Forget him.

147
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,270
朱莉娅...朱莉娅...朱莉娅..
Julia... Julia... Julia...

148
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,070
你得替我分担点重力 我的脚被束住了.
I need to take the weight away from me, my foot's caught.

149
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,830
- 你明白吗？ - 明白了
-You got it? -I got it.

150
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
当我拉的时候,你在后面推一下
Now just push it to me as I pull.

151
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,150
这远远不够
It's never enough.

152
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,500
朱莉娅
Julia. Jul...

153
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,190

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,750
这儿
Here.

157
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,270
伤口很深吗？
Oh, is it deep?

158
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,190
不知道,我没有看
I don't know. I haven't looked.

159
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,990
你知道我怕血.
You know me and blood.

160
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,810
- 我快晕倒了． - 你不会晕倒
-I'm gonna faint. -You're not going to faint.

161
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,430
他妈的
Oh, shit!

162
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,990
- 让我看看 - 他妈的．
-Let me see. -Shit!

163
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,150
得去医院缝几针
Oh, it's going to need stitches.

164
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,550
- 但我都快呕吐了． - 你不能吐
-I'm gonna throw up. -You're not going to throw up.

165
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,030
- 放松点儿．放松点儿 - 我都快呕吐了．
-Just take it easy, just take it easy. -I'm gonna throw up.

166
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,190
不会有事儿
It's going to be all right

167
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,990
让我送你去医院
Let's get you to the hospital.

168
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,710
我真是太笨了
So stupid.

169
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,030
怎么啦？
What happened?

170
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,030
只是个小意外.他没事了
It was just an accident. He's all right.

171
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,190
我说,你来开车好吗？ 得去医院给他缝几针
Look, will you drive? He needs stitches.

172
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,320
- 当然可以． - 车钥匙在厨房里
-Yeah, sure. -The keys are in the kitchen.

173
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,460
- 我太笨了． - 不会有事儿
-So stupid. - It's all right.

174
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,310
不不,我真不是开玩笑
No no, I am not kidding.

175
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,990
当时那个医生正在四处闲逛....
This doctor is poking around

176
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,750
就像纳粹集中营里的军医 看见犯人一样兴奋
with all the delicacy and compassion of Josef Mengele,

177
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,710
我警告他: 听着 我要晕过去了喔！
and I'm warning him, : Listen, I'm gonna pass out

178
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,360
他说,噢！你当然不会,老兄
He says, Oh no, of course you're not, old boy. Of course you're not

179
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,550
接下来我倒在地面上...
The next thing you know, I'm on the floor

180
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,940
他傻站在那儿, 好像他才是需要帮助的人
and he's standing there like he's the one who needs help.

181
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,720
可能他是怕你因此而起诉他
He probably is afraid you're gonna sue him.

182
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,640
我应该起诉他
I should do it!

183
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,790
比尔,我应该这样做. 这些事你比较懂吧
Bill, I should do it. You know all about that stuff.

184
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,550
明天我会给你的打电话 我们起诉他吧
I'll call you tomorrow. We'll sue his ass.

185
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,700
这些医生们！
Doctors

186
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,490
没关系,亲爱的
That's right, honey.

187
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,550
我可爱的女儿喝了什么呢？
And what's my darling daughter drinking?

188
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,190
我不记得了
I don't remember.

189
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,270
噢,朱莉娅, 你还想来点白兰地吗？
Listen, Julia, you want some more bubbly?

190
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,590
噢,我不能再喝了 谢谢
Uh no. No more for me, thanks.

191
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,150
好了, 停停停
Okay. Okay, stop

192
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,740
- 我都站不稳了 - 那就躺下好了
-I'm not gonna be able to stand up. -So lie down.

193
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,910
我得先失陪了. 我想我得去睡了
Would you all excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.

194
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,430
你还好吗？亲爱的.
-Are you all right, darling? -Uh-huh.

195
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,270
- 我想我们都得到此为止了． - 不行 比尔
-I think we ought to be making a move, too - No Bill!

196
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,830
绝对不行.
Absolutely not!

197
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,950
这是装修工的夜晚
This is the night of the paper hat here.

198
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,670
我们得庆祝一番. 坐下吧
We're celebrating something, so sit down.

199
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,310
晚安.
Good night.

200
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,040
明天晚上你们再来吧
You'll have to come to us next.

201
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,470
对,很快就再见面了. 我希望你们再来
Yeah, real soon. I'm glad you're back.

202
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,870
谢谢
Thank you.

203
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,670
- 晚安 - 晚安
-Good night. -Good night.

204
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,940
- 还痛吗？ - 什么？
-Does it still hurt? -What?

205
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,070
噢,不,只是喝酒时才会如此
No, only when I drink.

206
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,190
噢,我的上帝
Oh, God.

207
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,030
不 拜托
Oh! Christ!

208
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,180
出去！

209
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,910
朱莉娅

噢,我的上帝
Oh my God.

211
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,350
不要看着我
Don't look at me.

212
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,700
谁？
Who--

213
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,590
你是谁？
who are you?

214
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,500
我说了,别看着我
I said don't look.

215
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,570
帮我
Help me!

216
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,710
告诉我,你是谁？
Tell me who you are.

217
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,840
我是弗兰克
Frank.

218
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,550

219

相信我,我就是弗兰克

221
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,270
真的是我
It's really me.

222
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,290
他滴在地板上的血使我又回来了
His blood on the floor, it brought me back.

223
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,950
回来？
Back?

224
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,750
从哪儿回来呢？
From where?

225
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,380
帮我忙,行吗？
Just help me, will you?

226
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,270
拜托了,上帝,帮我
Please, God, help me!

227
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,030
- 有人． - 等等
-Somebody -Wait.

228
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,390
你不能这样离开我. 你不能
You can't leave me like this. You can't.

229
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,990
你想让我做什么呢？
What do you want me to do?

230
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,830
血已经让我恢复到这个程度
The blood brought me this far.

231
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,490
我还要更多的血
I need more.

232
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,230
你得帮我康复
You have to heal me.

233
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,430
嘿.
Hi.

234
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,800
你还吗？
Are you all right?

235
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,030
克里斯蒂？我以为我把你弄丢了.
Kirsty? I thought I'd lost you.

236
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,910
没有,我在这儿
No, I'm here.

237
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,230
晚安
Good night.

238
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,550
你为什么不留在拉里家呢？ 那多有很多房间
So why didn't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.

239
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,230
噢,那儿是有房间. 但朱莉娅也在那儿
Oh, yeah, there's room, and there's Julia.

240
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,310
噢,我明白了
Ah. I see.

241
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,630
她也像你一样． 那么客套．
She's like you. She's so damn polite.

242
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,940
是吗？ 这有什么问题呢？
Oh, yeah? Meaning what?

243
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,310
我也不知道,她拘谨而冷淡
Oh, I don't know. She's uptight and frigid.

244
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,460
请再说一遍
I beg your pardon.

245
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,020
看到了吧,你就是这样 居然说：请再说一遍
See, there you go. ~ "I beg your pardon."

246
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,430
嘿,我们之间不冷淡吧.
Hey, we're not all frigid.

247
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,950
- 噢 不么？ - 噢 不。
-Oh, no? -Oh, no.

248
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,470
噢,不？
Oh, no?

249
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,270
噢,不
Oh, no.

250
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,750
可我以前都没有 听过别人这样客气说话
That's not what I heard.

251
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,630
那你一定是没有遇到正确的人。
Well, you must have been speaking to all the wrong people.

252
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,870
任何事都可以吗？
Anything?

253
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,910
任何事
Anything.

254
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,870
你会照办吗？

255
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:56,230
对,我会
Yes... I will.

256
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,030
克里斯蒂?克里斯蒂?
Ki rsty? Ki rsty?

257
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,070
克里斯蒂!

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,230
- 你还好吗？ - 对
-You all right? -Yeah.

259
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,190
我不知道
I don't know.

260
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,310
我在做梦
I--Iwas dreaming.

261
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,380
爸爸
Daddy!

我非常的好
Never better.

266
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,960
- 现在你去好好睡觉吧 - 好
-Now you sleep well, okay? -Yeah.

267
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,240
我爱你,甜心．
I love you, sweetie.

268
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,030
我也爱你,爸爸
I love you too, Daddy.

269
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,310
再见
Bye.

270
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,110
- 是谁呢？ - 她做了一个恶梦
Who was it? -She had a bad dream.

271

273
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,790
- 没什么意思 对吗？ - 什么？
-Not much fun, is it? - What?

274
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,910
一个人喝闷酒
Drinking alone.

275
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,350
没什么意思
Not much.

276
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,710
我想也许是吧,嗯
I thought maybe...

277
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,600
对了,
well...

278
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,510
如果我们都没有伴侣 也许我们可以一起喝酒
if we're both on our own, maybe we could have a drink together.

279
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,950
为什么不呢？
Why not?

280
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,460
你得知道,我不是经常...
You know, it's not often that I...

281
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,360
你也知道的
you know.

282
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,790
任何事都有第一次．
There's a first time for everything.

283
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,630
没错儿,对
That's right, yeah.

284
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,950
我想这倒是真的
I suppose that's right.

285
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,300
你要不要....... 来点儿喝的呢？
Would you... like a drink?

286
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,030
噢,不,不
Oh, no no no.

287
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,230
我已经过量了
I'm well over my limit.

288
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,430
你知道 这很有意思,
You know, it's funny,

289
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,310
但是...我..
but I...

290
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,230
我觉得我和你相识了 好几年似的,知道吗？
I feel like I've known you for years, you know?

291
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,710
怎么啦？
What's the matter?

292
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,640
是你带我来这儿的 不是吗？
It's what you brought me here for, isn't it?

293
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,600
噢,不是吗？
Well, isn't it?

294
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,360
我想是这样,对
I suppose so, yes.

295
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,990
那你是怎么回事呢？
So what's your problem?

296
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,150
让我们继续做吧
Let's get on with it.

297
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,910
你他妈不会改变主意吧,对吗？
You're not gonna change your fucking mind, are you?

298
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,550
对不起
I'm sorry.

299
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,510
我们到楼上去吧
Let's go upstairs.

300
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,380
好的,好的．对不起,去吧
Okay okay. Sorry, okay? Okay.

301
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,830
好的
Right.

302
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,400
这不是卧室
This isn't the bedroom.

303
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,630
不是
No.

304
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,830
那,这是怎么回事呢？
So what's going on?

305
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,390
没必非要用床,对吗？
We don't need a bed, do we?

306
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,070
是的,没错,我想没必要
Well, no, I suppose not.

307
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,830
我一直喜欢在地板上做.
I've always preferred the floor.

308
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,460
任何事儿都有第一次,对吗？
Oh. First time for everything, eh?

309
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,070
你为什么不...
Why don't you...

310
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,150
把你的夹克脱掉呢？
take your jacket off?

311
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,590
好,为什么不呢
Yeah, why don't I?

312
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,940
你为什么不一起脱？
Why don't you do the same thing?

313
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,550
也许我会的
Maybe I will.

314
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,510
你真是太漂亮了
You're very beautiful.

315
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,950
我漂亮吗？
Am I?

316
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,910
你知道你的美貌.
Oh, you know you are.

317
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,950
你是我见过的 最可爱的女人
Loveliest woman... I've ever seen.

318
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,350
噢,我的上帝
Oh, Christ.

319
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,070
怎么啦？
What's wrong?

320
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,570
等一会儿
Just one minute.

321
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,190
喝了太多的酒
Too much drink.

322
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,390
把膀胱里的水放干
Empty the old bladder.

323
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,350
你锁的门？
Did you lock this?

324
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,830
拜托！拜托了
Please! Please!

325
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,390
别看着我
Don't look at me.

326
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,880
我的上帝
Jesus Christ.

327
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,790
看到了吗？
See?

328
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,790
这再次让我复原了
It's making me whole again.

329
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,220
洒出的每一滴血 都会使我的骨头上增添新肉
Every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones.

330
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,390
我们都希望这样,不是吗？
And we both want that, don't we?

331
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,510
太好了
Good.

332
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,840
这儿来
Come here.

333
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,060
他妈的过来. 我想抚摸你
Come here, damn you, I wanna touch you.

334
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,310
到爸爸这儿来
Come to Daddy.

335
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,070
朱莉娅
Julia!

336
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,470
朱莉娅
Julia.

337
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,230
出来,快出来, 你在哪儿呢？
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

338
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,870
朱莉娅？我在叫你啊. 你听不到吗？
Julia, I was calling for you. Didn't you hear?

339
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,750
你在那儿吗？
Are you in there?

340
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,430
你要吃甜饼吗？亲爱的
You want a cookie, little girl?

341
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,090
我有点不舒服
I'm feeling sick.

342
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,550
噢,宝贝. 我能帮你做点什么呢？
Oh, babe. Is there anything I can get you?

343
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,750
来点白兰地,好吗？
Maybe a--a brandy.

344
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,350
马上就好
It's coming right up.

345
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,390
我很快回来
Ill be down... in a minute.

346
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,350
好的.
Okay.

347
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,630
不必那么急
There's no hurry.

348
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,820
弗兰克
Frank?

349
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,030
我很痛
-Oh. -I'm hurting.

350
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,400
痛？
Hurting?

351
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,710
我的神经开始起作用了
My nerves are beginning to work again.

352
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,710
太好了
Good.

353
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,790
再来一个 也许要两个...
One more, maybe two...

354
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,180
- 没有下次 - 你得让我完全康复
-Not again. -to heal me completely.

355
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,170
这样在他们开始追捕前 我们可以逃走
Then we can be away from here before they start to follow.

356
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,150
- 谁？ - 修道士
-Who? -The Cenobites.

357
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,810
他们发现我只是时间问题... 我得躲开他们
It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them.

358
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,550
我必须离开这儿
I must get away from here.

359
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,390
朱莉娅？
Julia?

360
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,590
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

361
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,350
等我一小会儿
Just a moment.

362
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,990
放些音乐,好吗？宝贝
Put on some music. Will you, babe?

363
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,480
当然可以
Yeah, sure.

364
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,430
可怜的拉里,还是那么顺从
Poor Larry, obedient as ever.

365
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,680
你小声点儿
Keep your voice down.

366
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,070
不想让你的宝贝听见吗？
Don't want babe to hear.

367
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,670
你很痛
You're hurting.

368
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,750
你不会欺骗我,对吗？
You won't cheat me, will you?

369
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,430
我会跟我在一起 帮助我
You'll stay with me, help me.

370
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,080
这样我们能像以往一样,永远在一起
Then we can be together the way we were before.

371
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,450
现在我们彼此拥有...
We belong to each other now.

372
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,030
同甘 ,共苦
For better, for worse.

373
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,020
唯有真爱
Like love...

374
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,110
至死不渝
only real.

375
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,270
对不起.我是新来的. 你得等等才行
I'm sorry--I'm new here. You're gonna have to wait.

376
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,990
拜托你别乱动,好吗？
Could you not do that, please?

377
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,950
经理在哪儿呢？
Where's the manager?

378
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,230
这的确是个问题 因为他出去吃午餐了
That's a problem too, because he's out to lunch right now.

379
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,310
我想见见负责人
I want to see somebody in charge.

380
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,920
那你得等等才行
Then you're gonna have to wait.

381
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,070
- 抱歉． - 打搅了
-Excuse me. -Well, excuse me!

382
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,470
你在做什么呢？
What are you doing?

383
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,510
快点放回去
Give those back.

384
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,950
噢,我的上帝啊
Oh myGod.

385
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,990
出去.
Get out.

386
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,750
你给我滚出去
You get out of here.

387
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,280
- 嗨 - 嗨
-Hi. -Hi.

388
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,670
刚刚路过, 想看看你下班之后都做些什么
Just came by to see what you're doing after work.

389
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,870
怎么啦？
What's wrong?

390
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,990
- 很古怪的事儿． - 什么？
-Something weird. -What?

391
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,140
没什么
Nothing.

392
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,670
你保证我们不会受到干扰吗？
You're sure we're not gonna be interrupted?

393
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,550
绝对不会
Quite sure.

394
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,230
我只是...
Only I--uh...

395
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,380
我想还是小心点的好
I like to be careful.

396
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,230
我可以品尝到味道了
I can taste that.

397
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,160
我有好长一段时间 品尝不到任何味道
IVs a long time since I tasted anything.

398
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,240
你答应过我,会向我解释
You promised me an explanation.

399
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,000
就是这个
This is it.

400
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,990
- 让我看看． - 不 不要碰它！
-Let me see. -No, don't touch it!

401
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,270
很危险.它能把门打开
It's dangerous. It opens doors.

402
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,440
什么样的门呢？
What kind of doors?

403
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,160
通向快乐的天堂,或者是痛苦的地狱
Doors to the pleasures of heaven or hell.

404
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,950
我已经不在乎是哪个
I didn't care which.

405
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,590
我原以为我已经经历了人生的极限
I thought I'd gone to the limits.

406
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,670
但是 修道士给了我超越了极限的体验
I hadn't. The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond limits.

407
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,510
痛苦与快乐,纠缠交错
Pain and pleasure... indivisible.

408
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,030
他们不能再把我带回去
They won't get me back.

409
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,550
我得活下去,你得帮助我,好吗？
I'm going to live and you're going to help me, yes?

410
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:15,710
好
Yes.

411
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,430
他们永远也不会找到我
They'll never find us,

412
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,830
在整个茫茫人世
not in the whole wide world.

413
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,390
布恩击中他了.
Boom Boom has got him now!

414
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,270
布恩击中他了.
Boom Boom has got him.

415
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,990
他又被击倒了
He's knocked down again.

416
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,750
我想这些东西使你很厌恶吧
I thought this kind of stuff made you sick.

417
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,380
我看过更糟的
I've seen worse.

418
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,210
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

419
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,130
好啊
Fine.

420
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,850
如果你不喜欢, 我们也可以看点别的
Cause we can watch something else

421
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,910
快！干掉他！
Come on! Get him!

422
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,190
噢,不！
Ah! No! No!

423
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,190
那是什么声音？
What was that?

424
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,010
我想我没有把楼上的窗户关好 我去看看
I think I left a window open upstairs. I'll go see.

425
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:12,940
不用
No.

426
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,040
拉里,那里没什么
Larry! It was nothing.

427
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,350
拉里
Larry!

428
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,670
你到底怎么啦？
What's the matter with you anyway?

429
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,030
只是...是因为我害怕打雷声
It's just that I hate the thunder.

430
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,520
我在这儿
I'm here.

431
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,670
你很安全
You're safe.

432
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:36,550
你在发抖
You're trembling.

433
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,550
没有什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

434
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,470
你看
Look.

435
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,870
我必须去看看
I really should check it out.

436
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,070
别去那儿,拜托了
Don't go up there, please.

437
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,750
我们一起去吧.来吧
We'll both go up. Come on.

438
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,230
- 拉里 拜托了． - 别担心．来吧
-Larry, please! -Don't worry about it. Come on.

439
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,750
- 别． - 没事的
-Don't. -It's okay. It's okay.

440
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,790
可能是老鼠
It's probably a rat.

441
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,510
我告诉过你
I told you.

442
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,110
没有什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

443
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,870
我们下楼去吧. 我会处理好
Let's go downstairs. I'll make it better.

444
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,420
不要,这儿的光线已经很足了
No, this is enough light.

445
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,260
我们走吧.来吧
Let's go, come on.

446
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:19,590
我们进里面去
Let's go inside.

447
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,980
好的
Oh, yes.

448
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,030
好的 好的
Yes. Yes.

449
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,020
不
No.

450
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,350
不
No!

451
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,340
不,拜托了, 不,求你了
No, please don't. No, please!

452
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,030
我受不了,拜托了！
I can't bear it, please!

453
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,580
求你别这样
Please, no!

454
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,590
拜托了
Please!

455
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,230
拜托了,别
Please stop!

456
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,540
我受不了啦！ 拜托你别这样
I can't bear it! Please, no!

457
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,270
我不明白
I don't understand you.

458
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,820
一分钟之前
I mean, one minute...

459
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,430
你比我还亢奋,但接着就...
you're all over me, and the next...

460
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,550
你真让我弄不懂
I just don't understand you.

461
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,630
我也不知道
I don't know.

462
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,560
也许我们不该回这儿
Maybe we shouldn't have come back.

463
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,130
住在布鲁克林绝对不会比这儿更糟
Brooklyn certainly wasn't any worse than this.

464
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,180
听着
Look.

465
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,050
你很爱她 那肯定是她有 值得你爱的地方
You love her, so there must be something worth loving.

466
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,670
我希望问题真的那么简单就好了
I wish it were that simple.

467
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,110
我现在真的有麻烦了,孩子
I've got a real problem here, kiddo.

468
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,580
她甚至不愿离开家门
She doesn't even want to leave the house.

469
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,950
真的吗？
Really?

470
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,990
她好像在...
It's like she's...

471
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,790
等待着什么似的
waiting for something.

472
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,410
是什么？
What?

473
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,510
我不知道
I don't know.

474
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,630
我不知道
I don't know.

475
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,210
这些我可想不透
It's way beyond me.

476
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,880
听着
Look.

477
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,840
你能.. 你会...
Could you-- would you...

478
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,750
找个时间？
.stop by sometime?

479
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,040
试试跟她交朋友,好吗？
Try to make friends?

480
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,830
当然可以.
Sure.

481
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,510
谁知道呢？ 也许她只是想找个说话的人
Who knows,maybe all she needs is somebody to talk to.

482
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,260
- 你不能爱他 - 你知道的 我不爱他
-You can't love him. -You know I don't.

483
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,430
- 那这有什么妨碍呢？ - 我说了不行
-So where's the harm? -I said no.

484
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,590
那么在修道士来之前 再去找别的人来
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.

485
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,980
马上
Now!

486
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,180
我...
I... uh...

487
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,470
有时我很孤单
I get lonely sometimes.

488
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,750
人人都是如此
Everybody does.

489
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,110
请进
Come in.

490
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,110
这是什么？
What is this,

491
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,750
做游戏吗？
a game?

492
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,110
我的上帝啊
Jesus Christ!

493
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,730
噢,上帝,救命
Oh, Christ! Help me!

494
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,430
不
Don't!

495
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,010
- 快出去！！ - 求你了
-Get out of here! -Please.

496
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,580
别让他杀我
Don't let him kill me.

497
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,390
救命啊
Help me.

498
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,310
不
No.

499
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,910
- 克里斯蒂 我是弗兰克 弗兰克叔叔 - 不
-Kirsty, it's Frank. It's Uncle Frank. -No!

500
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,750
- 你还记得我吧． - 不
-You remember. -No!

501
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,310
- 到叔叔这儿来 - 放开我！
-Come to Daddy. -Get the fuck off of me!

502
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,400
你长大了, 很漂亮
You've grown. You're beautiful.

503
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:27,110
别...别碰我
Don't-- don't touch me!

504
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,080
别碰我,救命啊...
Don't touch me or so help mel

505
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,790
你要做什么呢？
What will you do?

506
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,110
你能做什么呢？
What can you do?

507
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,880
没有什么害怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

508
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,870
我敢说,你让你父亲很自豪吧
I bet you make your daddy so proud.

509
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,510
你是这么漂亮
Don't you, beautiful?

510
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,600
怎么会这样！
This isn't happening.

511
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:45,980
我常常对自己说
I used to tell myself that.

512
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,380
我总是假装自己所承受的痛苦 都只是一场梦
Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.

513
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,270
但是不要自欺欺人了
But don't you kid yourself.

514
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,820
有些痛苦是人类必须要承受的
Some things have to be endured,

515
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,410
唯有如此, 才能让快乐来的更甜美
and that's what makes the pleasures so sweet.

516
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,670
不
No!

517
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,970
把那个还给我
Give me that!

518
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,070
- 不． - 把它还给我
-No. -Give it to me!

519
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,470
你想要吗？
You want it?

520
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,800
最后一次机会！
One last time:

521
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,950
把那盒子还给我
give me that box.

522
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,280
- 你想要吗？ - 把盒子还给我！
-You want it? -Give me the box!

523
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,630

You want it? Fucking have it!

524
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,630
不
No!

525
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,020
克里斯蒂
Kirsty.

526
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,990
到我这儿来
(Echoes) Come to Daddy.

527
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,990
我是弗兰克 你记得吧.
It's Frank. You remember.

528
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,620
我是弗兰克叔叔
It's  Uncle Frank.

529
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,200
你还好吗？
Are you all right?

530
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,230
你醒了
You're awake.

531
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,630
- 好孩子． - 出什么事了？
-Good girl. -What happened?

532
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,510
- 我去叫医生 - 等等 我怎么会在这儿呢？
-I'll get the doctor. -Wait a minute. How did I get here?

533
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,310
我不会用很长时间
I won't be a moment.

534
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,000
拜托,回床上去
Please, get back into bed.

535
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,590
我得给我爸爸打电话.
I have to call my father.

536
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,030
这个很容易安排 但首先得回床上去.
That's easily arranged, but first, back into bed.

537
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,670
这很重要,真的很重要
It's important. It really is--

538
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,390
重要的事情先来
First things first.

539
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,600
我和你谈过之后, 我们会让你打电话
We'll get you a telephone after we've talked.

540
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,110
这是什么？是音乐盒吗？
What about this? Ring any bells?

541
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,110
你紧紧地抓着它不放
You were hanging onto it like grim death.

542
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,790
我不记得了.
I don't remember.

543
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,360
好了,警察想跟你淡淡 你也知道吧
Well, the police will want to speak to you. -You know that.

544
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,910
噢,我的上帝
Oh, Christ.

545
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,410
另外,也许这个能让你记起来吧
In the meantime, maybe this will jog your memory.

546
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,110
他妈的
Shit.

547
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,670
快打开！
Open!

548
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,630
噢,开门啊
Oh, come on!

549
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:55,740
你打开了盒子,
The box. You opened it,

550
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,050
我们就来了
we came.

551
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:59,160
这只是个游戏盒子
It's just a puzzle box!

552
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,510
噢,不.
Oh, no.

553
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,840
这意味着你召唤了我们
It is a means to summon us.

554
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,270
你是谁？
Who are you?

555
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,360
是未来世界的探险家
Explorers in the further regions of experience:

556
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:12,410
是某些人眼中的魔鬼 某些人眼中的天使
demons to some, angels to others.

557
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,670
这只是个误会
It was a mistake!

558
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,440
我不...我并不想把它打开的
I didn't--I didn't mean to open it!

559
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,550
这只是个误会
It was a mistake!

560
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,490
你们可以...回到地狱
You can all... go to hell!

561
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,120
不行.不能没有收获就离开
We can't. Not alone.

562
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,030
你启动了盒子.
You solved the box,

563
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,470
所以我们才来的 现在你得跟我们走
we came. Now you must come with us.

564
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,160
体会我们的快乐
Taste our pleasures

565
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,510
求你们走吧,放了我吧
Please, go away and leave me alone!

566
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:41,430
噢,请别流泪
Oh, no tears, please.

567
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,090
这是对美好磨难的一种浪费
It's a waste of good suffering.

568
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,480
等等！等等！等等！ 拜托你们等等
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please, wait!

569
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,480
没有争辩的时间了.
No time for argument.

570
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,150
这样的事以前 你们也做过,对吗？
You've done this before, right?

571
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,870
很多很多次了
Many, many times.

572
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,580
你们知道一个叫 弗兰克.科顿的男人吗？
To a man called Frank Cotton?

573
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:01,030
认得
Oh, yes.

574
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,190
他从你们手里跑掉了
He escaped you.

575
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:08,110
- 没人可以从我们这儿逃走． - 他逃了 我见过他的
Nobody escapes us. He did. I've seen him.

576
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,110
- 不可能！ - 他还活着
- Impossible. -He's alive!

577
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,580
即使他从我们手中逃脱
Supposing he had escaped us.

578
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,610
那又关你什么事呢？
What has that to do with you?

579
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:19,030
我可以... 我可以带你们去找他
I--I can-- I can lead you to him,

580
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,150
你们可以带他走,而不是我
and you can take him back instead of me.

581
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,950
也许我们更喜欢你
Perhaps we'd prefer you.

582
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,880
我想听到他的认罪
I want to hear him confess himself,

583
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,190
也许
then maybe...

584
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,150
也许
maybe.

585
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,150
但如果你敢骗我们...
But if you cheat us...

586
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:41,290
我们会把你的灵魂撕裂
We'll tear your soul apart.

587
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,070
她会把一切告诉他们.
She'll tell them everything.

588
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,550
我想不会 她会先去提醒拉里
I don't think so. She'll want to warn Larry first.

589
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,550
现在也许是她了
That's probably her now...

590
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,630
- 或者是警察 - 那没有任何区别
-or the police. -It doesn't make any difference.

591
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,550
你不担心吗？
Don't you care?

592
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,830
我在乎的是新的肌肤
What I care about is a new skin.

593
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,150
也许我们得离开．
Maybe we should just leave.

594
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,350
像这样离开吗？看看我
Like this? Look at me.

595
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,710
我们不能留在这儿
We can't just stay here.

596
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,150
我兄第马上就会回家
My brother will be home soon.

597
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,590
怎么啦？
What is it?

598
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,220
我不知从何说起
I don't know where to begin.

599
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,440
你在说什么呢？
What are you talking about?

600
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:41,600
你最好自己看看吧
It's best you see for yourself.

601
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,110
我让她安稳地呆在这儿.
I left her here safe and sound.

602
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
我甚至把门都锁上了
I even locked the door.

603
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,070
但她现在不在这儿了
Well, she's not here now.

604
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,510
我也在找她
I'll start looking for her.

605
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,430
也许她回...
Maybe she's gone back to...

606
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,190
回她爸爸家去了
to her father's house.

607
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
爸爸？
Daddy?

608
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,750
爸爸,是我！克里斯蒂. 让我进去
Daddy, it's me, it's Kirsty! Let me in!

609
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,990
爸爸,让我进来吧
Daddy, let me in!

610
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:02,510
- 克里斯蒂 很晚了 - 我爸爸在哪儿呢？
-Kirsty? It'ss very late. -Where is my dad?

611
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,810
- 出什么事了？ - 我想见我爸爸
-What's the matter? -I want to see my father!

612
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,370
当然可以
Of course.

613
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,990
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

614
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,670
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

615
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,940
爸爸
Daddy?

616
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,530
爸爸
Daddy?

617
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:31,190
- 爸爸！你还好吗？ - 我当然好 我当然好
-Daddy, you're okay. You're all right. -Sure I am. I am.

618
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,000
- 你没事吧． - 没事儿
-You're okay! -It's okay.

619
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,700
我真怕你出意外
I was so afraid that something happened to you.

620
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,550
我知道.我知道
I know, I know.

621
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,910
我得跟你淡淡．
I need to talk to you.

622
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,280
当然可以
Yeah. Of course.

623
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,390
好了,宝贝. 朱丽娅把一切都告诉我了
It's okay, baby. Julia told me everything.

624
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,350
噢,不,你得明白...
Oh, no, see...

625
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:56,230
你兄第弗兰克在楼上
your brother Frank is upstairs.

626
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,150
他住在楼上 他想要你的命
He's upstairs and he's trying to kill you.

627
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,540
- 他会杀了你！ - 等等 等等 等等
-He's gonna kill you! -No, wait, wait, wait.

628
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,130
弗兰克做的事儿真是可怕极了
Whatever Frank did was unspeakable.

629
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,090
真是可怕极了
Unspeakable.

630
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,010
但你得相信我
But believe me,

631
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,950
一切都结束了
it's finished with now.

632
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,240
为什么结束了呢？
Why is it finished?

633
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,500
他没了
He's gone.

634
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,220
"没了" 是什么意思？
What does 'gone' mean?

635
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,430
他死了,克里斯蒂
He's dead, Kirsty.

636
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,670
他是个疯子,宝贝.
He was insane, baby.

637
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,240
他是条疯狗,我得帮他结束悲剧
A mad dog. I had to put him out of his misery.

638
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:34,360
我的上帝,多惨的场面
Jesus, what a scene.

639
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,470
等我感觉好点以后
And when I'm feeling better,

640
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,000
我会报警并向他们说明白
Ill go to the police and try to make them understand.

641
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,870
这恐怕只有上帝明白了
God knows...

642
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,870
我自己都想不明白怎么回事
I don't really understand myself.

643
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,210
他有没有伤害你？宝贝
Did he hurt you, baby?

644
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,670
没有,我很好
No, I'm okay.

645
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,830
他死了更好,我可怜的弗兰克
He's better off dead. Poor Frank.

646
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,110
真是让我难以置信.
I don't believe this.

647
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,890
- 真是让我难以置信 - 相信这一切吧
-I don't believe this. -Believe it.

648
01:13:12,410 --> 01:13:13,990
我得看看他
I need to see him.

649
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,380
- 不行 没必要了． - 不 我要看！

651
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,840
带她去看看
Show her.

652
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,650
我要找干这事儿的男人
We want the man who did this.

653
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,630
不.
No.

654
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,390
不, 这不是咱们说好的
No, that wasn't the deal.

655
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,800
那是我父亲,你们不能抓他
He's my father and you can't have him.

656
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,270
不要！
No!

657
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,300
啊！让开！

658
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,480

01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,320
让开
Move!

660
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,910
怎么啦？
What's the matter?

661
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,390
没时间了
There's no time.

662
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,750
我告诉你了,现在一切都结束了
Wait, no wait. I told you all that's over with now.

663
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,760
不,还没有. 我们得离开这儿
No, it's not! We've got to get out of here!

664
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,630
不,跟我们呆在一起
No, stay with us.

665
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,370
我们会很开心
We can all be happy here.

666
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:17,430
不
No.

667
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,030
到爸爸这儿来
Come to Daddy.

668
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,710
我的上帝
Oh my God!

669
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,510
来...
Come...

670
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,670
爸爸这儿来
to Daddy.

671
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,590
弗兰克
-Ah! -Frank!

672
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,950
好吧
Well...

673
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,800
猫与老鼠的游戏 到此为止了
so much for the catand-mouse shit!

674
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,700
不
No!

675
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,510
不是我
Not me!

676
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,870
要不徇私情,宝贝
It's nothing personal, baby.

677
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,270
你在哪儿？美人儿
Where are you, beautiful?

678
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,430
出来,出来,不论你在哪儿
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

679
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,950
老天
Oh my God.

680
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:05,120
爸爸,爸爸
Daddy.

681
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,310
不要,别为他而悲伤了
No, don't mourn him.

682
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,870
在我们触到他之前, 他就已经被吓死了
He was dead long before we ever touched him.

683
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,470
- 杂种！ - 安静点儿
-Bastard! -Hush now.

684
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:18,390
一切都很完美.
Everything's all right.

685
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,520
弗兰克在这儿
Frank's here.

686
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:20,600
杂种！
Bastard!

687
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:23,390
你亲爱的弗兰克叔叔
Your dear old Uncle Frank.

688
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,040
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is that?

689
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,230
弗兰克
Frank.

690
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,430
不！
No!

691
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,290
我们得听到你的亲口忏悔
We had to hear it from your own lips.

692
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,440
这并非是做给你看的
This isn't for your eyes.

693
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,520
你给我下圈套
You set me up,

694
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,400
婊子！
bitch!

695
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,700
上帝也要流泪
Jesus wept

696
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,800
不会这么快离开我们,对吗？
Not leaving us so soon, are you?

697
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,860
我们还有好多景色要给你看
We have such sights to show you.

698
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,940
噢,他妈的
Oh, shit.

699
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:12,320
- 不！不要这样做 - 去地狱吧
-No! Don't do that! -Go to hell!

700
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,910
克里斯蒂
Kirsty!

701
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,520
克里斯蒂
Kirsty!

702
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,110
不
No.

703
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:35,500
史蒂夫
Steve.

704
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,350
不!
No!

705
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,920
他妈的！
Oh, shit!

706
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:50,270
噢,克里斯蒂 谢天谢地,你还好.
Oh, Kirsty! Thank God you're okay.

707
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,630
我们马上离开这个鬼地方
Let's get the hell out of here! Now!

708
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,130
噢,不
