1
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
她在那儿!
There she is!

2
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,450
格洛里亚!
Gloria!

3
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,910

-你看起来棒极了。-谢谢!

6
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,120
-达西，你去哪儿了?——嘿!这就跟你问声好！
- Darcy, where have you been? - Hey! Hi!

7
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,750
我只是花了一分钟。这样可以吗?
I was just taking a minute. Is that allowed?

8
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,210
不是在你的婚礼上。
Not at your wedding.

9
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,790
-你的凯特尔一号马提尼。——哦。
- Your Ketel One martini. - Oh.

10
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,560
Obrigada,杰罗姆。
Obrigada, Jerome.

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,510
新郎呢?
Where is the groomzilla?

12
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,510
汤姆不是伴郎，好吗?
Tom is not a groomzilla, okay?

13
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,260
他只是致力于让每个细节都完美。
He just committed to making every detail perfect.

14
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,390
这场婚礼你应该拿你父亲的钱。
You should have taken your father's money for this wedding.

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,890
然后，专业人士会为你做好一切。
Then, professionals would make everything perfecto for you.

16
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,610
妈妈，我跟你说过了。我们都是成年人了，我们想为自己的婚礼买单，这样婚礼就能成为我们想要的。
Mom, I've told you. We are adults and we wanted to pay for our own wedding so it could be what we wanted.

17
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,250
这就是你想要的?
And this is what you wanted?

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,990
那是印刷错误。
That was a printing error.

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,110
哦，我差点开枪打你!
Oh, I almost shoot you!

28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,280
我以为你是个海盗，但你只是个普通人。
I thought you're a pirate but you're just a guy.

29
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,350
这是给你新娘的，对吧?
Ah, this is for your bride, huh?

30
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,290
是啊，想给她个惊喜。
Yeah, trying to surprise her.

31
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,360
我在Etsy上看到过类似的东西，看起来很完美，但现在我不太确定了。
I saw something just like it on Etsy, and it looked perfect, but now I'm not so sure.

32
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,090
我想浪漫一点，但又不太老套。
Now, I wanna be romantic but not too corny.

33
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,070
这两者之间只有一线之隔。
There's a really fine line between the two.

34
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,490
你不是应该在那边吗?
Aren't you supposed to be over there?

35
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,690
你的彩排派对。
Your rehearsal party.

36
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,910
哦，天哪!
Oh, my God!

37
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,480
我需要你和你父亲的瑜伽老师谈谈。
I need you to talk to your father's yoga teacher.

38
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,530
——女友?-是啊，随便吧。
- Girlfriend? - Yeah, whatever.

39
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,490
她一直对我微笑。
She keeps smiling at me.

40
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,530
你能告诉她别对我笑了吗?
Can you tell her to stop smiling at me?

41
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,730
是的,妈妈。
Yes, Mom.

42
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,080
我会告诉爸爸的女朋友别对你笑了。
I will tell Dad's girlfriend to stop smiling at you.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,620
这不会引起任何问题。
That won't cause any issues.

44
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,500
还有，我不能和汤姆的妈妈坐在一张桌子上。
Also, I cannot sit at a table with Tom's mother.

45
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,170
在这里的船上，她试着跟着唱《南太平洋》。
On the boat here, she tried to start a sing-along to South Pacific.

46
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,050
她很兴奋。好吗?
She's excited. Okay?

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,130
她以前从没出过国。
She's never been out of the country before.

48
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,056
什么样的成年女性从未出过国?
What kind of a grown woman has never left the country?

49
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,140
求你了，妈妈，这两天，你能不能和…卡罗尔!
Please, Mom, for two days, can you just get along with... Carol!

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,930

自从汤米宝宝从我肚子里被割出来我就一直期待这一刻。
I've been looking forward to this moment ever since baby Tommy was cut out of my abdomen.

54
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,910
天啊，我还从没去过私人岛屿呢。
Oh, my God, I have never been on a private island before.

55
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,620
我从来没去过一个岛。
I've never been even on an island before.

56
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,166
事实上，你知道吗?这不是真的。
Actually, you know what? That's not true.

57
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,180
我和海伯曼一家一起去的。我们去了麦基诺，在他们搬到布卢明顿之前。
I went with the Heibermans. We went to Mackinac, you know, before they moved to Bloomington.

58
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,710
你去过麦基诺吗，瑞娜塔?
Have you ever been to Mackinac, Renata?

59
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,840
我不知道那是什么，也不知道你刚才说的大部分话。
I don't know what that is or most of the words you just said.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
她会很喜欢吗，拉里?
Wouldn't she just love it, Larry?

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,340
哦。嗨,达西。
Oh. Hi, Darcy.

62
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
嗨,拉里。

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,130
我没看到你在那儿。
I didn't see you there.

64
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,720
-嗨。-你好，瑞娜塔。

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,300
你猜怎么着?我们给你准备了礼物。
Guess what? We got you a gift.

66
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,100
-你不用这么做的-是的，我们做了。
- Oh, you didn't have to. - Yes, we did.

67
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,980
明天是我们人生中最重要的一天。
It's the biggest day of our lives tomorrow.

68
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,156
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,370
-快点，打开它。——好的。
- Come on, open it. - Okay.

70
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,770
-拉里，她要开门了。-我明白…哦。
- Larry, she's opening. - I get... Oh.

71
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,110
Ah-uh-huh。
Ah-uh-huh.

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,290
哦。有人把它落在浴室了。
Oh. Someone just left that in the bathroom.

73
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,910
你真是我的救命恩人，玛姬。
Oh, you're a lifesaver, Margy.

74
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,510
真不敢相信我迟到了。
I cannot believe I'm late for this.

75
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,930
客人们已经在一起了，你的达西正在和两位母亲说话。
The guests are already mingling, and your Darcy is talking to both the mothers.

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,470
哦,不。走了。走，走，走，走，走。
Oh, no. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

77
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,100
哦!
Oh!

78
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,300
你给我女儿买了生锈的刀?
You got my daughter rusty knives?

79
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,510
这是你“借来的东西”。
It's your "something borrowed."

80
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,050
我们家每个人结婚那天都要用。
Everyone in our family uses them on their wedding day.

81

给你带来一生的好运。

除了格雷格叔叔他被铲车砍了头。
Except for Uncle Greg who ended up getting decapitated on that forklift.

83
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,190
但这不是刀的错。
But that's not the knife's fault.

84

我很高兴你们俩还是朋友。

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,670
——躲躲猫!——哦。

97
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,050
这就跟你问声好！

我要去一下女厕。
I need to go to the ladies' room.

104
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,530
嘿，我也是。

105
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,720
当我穿着正装的时候，我喜欢站着尿尿。你呢?
When I'm in formal wear, I like to pee standing up. How about you?

106
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,960

- This... I just... - Nice to see you, Dad.

115
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,580
——先生。-我们暂时还是叫罗伯特吧
- Señor. - Let's just, uh, stick with "Robert" for a little while.

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,070
——正确的。罗伯特。-汤姆，我听说是你发现了这个不可思议的度假村。
- Right. Robert. - Tom, I heard you were the one who found this incredible resort.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,030
-是的。我做到了。——是的。
- Yeah. I did. - Yes.

118
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,950
我其实是研究生物共振的，这地方充满了能量振动。
I actually study bioresonance, and this place is teeming with energetic vibrations.

119
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,910
-嗯-就像我们的房间里到处都是虫子
- Mm. - It's just like our room teeming with bugs.

120
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,580
四季酒店本来不错，但你不想让我帮忙，所以…有些东西比钱更重要，爸爸。-是的。
The, uh, Four Seasons would've been nice, but you didn't want my help, so... Some things are more important - than money, Dad. - Yeah.

121
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,230
这是有争议的。
That's debatable.

122
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,010
我想再喝一杯。
Well, I need another drink.

123
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,300

好吧,嗯…我很好。
Okay, well... I'm fine.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,850
他会喜欢我吗?
Is he ever gonna like me?

127
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,120
是的，只要你冷静下来，表现得像你自己。
Yes, if you just chill out and start acting like yourself.

128
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,120
天啊，我们的家人真多。
God, our families are a lot.

129
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,480
-什么意思?-你去哪儿了?
- What do you mean? - And where have you been?

130
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,246
我刚完成一个小项目。
I was just finishing up a little project.

131
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,270
我错过了什么?
What'd I miss?

132
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,610
你妈妈给了我诅咒刀。
Oh, well, your mom gave me cursed knives.

133
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,370
然后我妈差点冲我爸的女朋友吼因为她笑了。
And then my mom almost yelled at my dad's girlfriend for smiling.

134
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,490
——哦。-还有，你表姐艾米问我哪里可以给振动棒充电。
- Oh. - Oh, also, your cousin, Amy, asked where she could charge her vibrator.

135
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,500
哦，艾米表妹来了?
Oh, so, Cousin Amy came?

136
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,830
她很快就会的。
She will soon.

137
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,040
嗯，你穿的是什么?
Um, what are you wearing?

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,540
哦，这是，呃…你的头发怎么都湿了?
Oh, it's, uh... Why is your hair all wet?

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,520
哦,我……我只是…我…我在月光下游了个泳。
Oh, I... I just... I... You know, I went for a little moonlight swim.

140
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,340
你掉进水里了，是吗?
You fell in the water, didn't you?

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,190
是的，我掉进水里了。
Yeah, I fell in the water.

142
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,780
你知道吗，你这么不会撒谎还挺可爱的。
You know, it's kinda cute how bad you are at lying.

143
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,210
只是…答应我…答应我，今晚都别放开我的手，好吗?
Just... Just promise me... Promise me, you won't let go of my hand for the rest of the night, okay?

144
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,400
我保证。
I promise.

145
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,840
Ace。
Ace.

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,120
艾斯刚放了蜜月歌单。我需要改变它。
Ace just put on the honeymoon playlist. I need to change it.

147
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,120
用"需要"这个词对吗?
Well, is "need" the right word?

148
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,720
-爸爸，求你了。-是啊。
- Dad, please. - Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,966
汤米，汤米，我需要你，就五分钟。
Tommy, Tommy, I need you for, like, five minutes.

150
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,216
——什么?不，不，不。-紧急情况
- What? No, no, no, no. - It's an emergency.

151
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,100
我一直在准备伴郎致辞，对吧，进展得很顺利。
I've been working on my best-man speech, right, and it is going really well.

152
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,520
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hey.

153
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,320
爸爸的女朋友刚问我爱的语言是什么。
Dad's girlfriend just asked me what my love language is.

154
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,450
她很糟糕。
She sucks.

155
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,560
二十年来我见你最开心了。
Happiest I've seen you in 20 years.

156
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
——谢谢。——干杯。
- Thanks. - Cheers.

157
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,090
爸爸邀请了你的前任?
Dad invited your ex?

158
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,460
上帝!他是怎么变得越来越热的?
God! How does he just keep getting hotter?

159
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,100
看来他要去看色情电影了。
Looks like he's leading a porn safari.

160
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,720
我本不想邀请他，但爸爸坚持说巴厘岛很近。
I didn't wanna invite him, but Dad insisted because he said Bali was so close.

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,260
哇。哇，哇，哇。哇,哇。
Wow. Wow, wow, wow. wow, wow.

162
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,470
老爸就是个爱惹是生非的贱人。
Dad is a messy bitch who loves the drama.

163
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,860
他从来没回复过，所以我们以为没事了。
Well, he never RSVP'd, so we thought we were in the clear.

164
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,140
我没想到他真的来了。你知道，他从来没有回复过。
I didn't think he'd actually come. You know, he never RSVP'd.

165
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,960
不，这是个非常非常酷的举动。见到他我真的很兴奋。
No, that's a very, very cool move. I'm really excited to meet him.

166
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,456
哦，看起来他很着急，忘记把衬衫扣子扣上了。
Oops, looks like he was in a rush and forgot to button his shirt all the way up.

167
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
蒂蒂。
Deedee.

168
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
-嘿，伙计，你好吗?-嗨。
- Hey, man, how are you? - Hey.

169
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,570
嗨,肖恩!
Hi, Sean!

170
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,660
很抱歉我迟到了。
I am so sorry that I'm late.

171
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,886
你爸爸在最后一刻要我去日本，然后，你知道，我不得不从京都租了一架飞机，就像整件事一样。-不，没关系。我们只是…
Your dad needed me to go to Japan at the last minute, and then, you know, I had to charter a jet from Kyoto, - just like a whole thing. - No, it's okay. We just...

172
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,386
我们不知道你要来。
You know, we didn't know you were coming.

173
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,500
你爸爸和我想给你个惊喜。
Your dad and I wanted to surprise you.

174
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,010
宝贝，你知道我无论如何都不会错过你的婚礼的，对吧?
Look, babe, you know I wasn't gonna miss your wedding for anything in this world, right?

175
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,880
-肖恩，这是汤姆。——汤姆。
- Sean, I want you to meet Tom. - Tom.

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,640
-哦，嘿!——汤姆!
- Oh, hey! - Tom!

177
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
-汤姆，汤姆，汤姆。——肖恩。是的。
- Tom, Tom, Tom. - Sean. Yeah.

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,896
-很高兴认识你。-嘿，汤姆。
- Nice to meet you. - Hey, Tom.

179
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,980
伙计，我一直很想见见迪迪的球员。
Man, I have been dying to meet Deedee's ball player, man.

180
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,270
你踢什么位置?
What position you play?

181
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,276
-我是…好吧,我……-他是指定击球手。
- I'm a... Well, I... - He's a designated hitter.

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:31,860
不幸的是，他们没有签他的合同，所以严格来说，他失业了，但是…40岁从未成年球员中被裁掉。
Uh, unfortunately, they didn't pick up his contract, so, technically, he's unemployed, but... Cut from the minors at 40.

183
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,950
汤姆，这是一个艰难的突破。但如果你保持乐观，你在教练这一行会有很好的前途。
That's a tough break, Tom. But if you stay positive, you could have a really great future in coaching.

184
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,150
你懂我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

185
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,590
是的。
Yeah.

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,580
这是个好主意。
That is an excellent idea.

187
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,790
-我想是的。-谢谢。
- I think so. - Thank you.

188
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,990
是的。
Yeah.

189
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,000
该吃晚饭了吗?
Is it time for dinner?

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,420
你们不远万里来到这里，我们很感动。
We are so very touched that you all made the trek out here.

191
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,590
我们真的想选一个你们都不方便的地方。
You know, we really wanted to pick a place that was convenient for none of you.

192
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,026
你知道吗，我在律所话太多了。
You know what, I talk too much at the law firm.

193
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:09,570
所以我要把它交给风云人物，是他成就了这个周末，我可爱的汤姆。
So I am going to hand it over to the man of the hour, the guy who made this whole weekend happen, my lovely Tom.

194
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,300
谢谢你！
Thank you.

195
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,240
-去吧!-加油，姑娘!
- Do it! - You go, girl!

196
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,050
嗯…——是的!-你能行的。
Uh... - Yeah! - You got this.

197
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,930
对吧?
Right?

198
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,126
我可以即兴发挥，对吧?
I can just wing this, right?

199
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:30,216
达西说了很多关于，她在巴厘岛和平队的日子，我就想，如果我们在那里结婚该有多酷。
Darcy talked a lot about, uh, her time in the Peace Corps in Bali, and I thought, you know, how cool would it be if we got married there.

200
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,260
然后，我意识到巴厘岛的物价不像巴厘岛那样高。
And then, I realized that Bali was un-Bali-vably expensive.

201
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,300
我认为菲律宾更好。
I think the Philippines are better.

202
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,690
Ace?
Right, Ace?

203
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,360
Ace表示同意。下一个。
Ace agrees. Next.

204
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,180
哦!
Aw!

205
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,500
我知道你们很多人都见证了我的求婚。
I know a lot of you were there to witness my proposal.

206
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,830
震惊和惊喜。无价的。
The shock and surprise. Priceless.

207
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,900
不管怎样，爸爸妈妈，我只想说谢谢你们。
Anyway, Mom and Dad, I just wanna say thank you.

208
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,570
你们的承诺是我们所期待的。
Your commitment is something that we can only aspire to.

209
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,760
-我的天啊。-罗伯特，雷娜塔，我们希望我们的婚姻不像你们的。
- Oh, my God. - Robert, Renata, we hope our marriage is nothing like yours.

210
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,580
主,宝贝。主。
Pivot, baby. Pivot.

211
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,040
我是说，这不是…无论如何，都是一种性格判断。
I mean, that's not a... a character judgment, by any means.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,840
我是说，50%的婚姻都以离婚告终，对吧?
I mean, 50% of marriages end in divorce, right?

213
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,380
哈!太棒了。
Ha! Wonderful.

214
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,840
欢呼,每一个人。
Cheers, everybody.

215
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,400
-干杯，干杯，干杯。——干杯。
- Cheers, cheers, cheers. - Cheers.

216
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,450
我的天啊。这并不顺利。
Oh, my God. That did not go well.

217
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,100
不，那太棒了。
No, that was awesome.

218
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,770
我和迪迪是在巴厘岛的和平队认识的。
So Deedee and I met in the Peace Corps in Bali.

219
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,580
有一天，我们必须把这些医疗用品运到这个村庄。
And one day, we had to run these medical supplies to this village.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,360
我决定教她如何划船，这样我可以睡觉，她可以做所有的工作。
I decided to teach her how to drive the boat, so I could sleep and she could do all the work.

221
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,370
这姑娘第一次开车，就被海岸警卫队开了张超速罚单。
The first time our girl gets behind the wheel, she gets a damn speeding ticket from the coast guard.

222
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,210
对吧?迪迪做事从不半途而废。
Right? Deedee doesn't do anything half-assed.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,420
她知道自己想要什么，就会去追求，而且她不会退让。
She sees what she wants, she goes after it, and she doesn't settle for less.

224
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,620
这是真的，是真的。
It's true, it's true.

225
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,480
你们有些人可能知道，我和迪迪100年前订婚了。
So, as some of you may know, Deedee and I were, 100 years ago, were engaged.

226
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,720
但她取消了约会。
But she called it off.

227
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,510
不。不，不，不。
No. No, no, no, no.

228
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,160
她在等汤姆。
She was waiting for Tom.

229
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,570
那家伙一定是百万分之一的超新星才能抓住那个美丽的灵魂。
And that guy right there has gotta be a one-in-a-million supernova to snag that beautiful soul.

230
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,070
谢谢。
Thanks.

231
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,920
-谢谢，肖恩。-总之，我只想对你说一件事，迪迪。
- Thanks, Sean. - So, in conclusion, I just wanna say one thing to you, Deedee.

232
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,240
卡图卡卡奇。
Katuk kak ci.

233
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,620
是什么……什么?
What's... Katuk kak what?

234
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,710
哦,上帝。这很难解释。
Oh, God. Um, it's hard to explain.

235
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,390
其实意思是"去你爷爷的"它只是…这也不难解释。
It actually means, um, "Fuck your grandpa. " It's just... Well, that's not that hard to explain.

236
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,130
是啊，我也不知道。只是，在巴厘语中，这是非常无礼的。
Yeah, well, I don't know. Just, in Balinese, it's super offensive.

237
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,510
是啊，这在哪里都很无礼，不是吗?
Yeah, well, it's offensive everywhere, no?

238
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,430
-是的。我的意思是……它只是…-“去你爷爷的!”
- Yeah. I mean... It just... - "Fuck your grandpa!"

239
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,520
-它只是让我们发笑。-很有趣。
- It just made us laugh. - It is funny.

240
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,850
嗨,大家好。
Hi, everybody.

241
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,980
我是汤姆的小妹妹，珍妮。
I'm Tom's baby sister, Jeannie.

242
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,900
-是的，Jeannie!-嘿，珍妮!
- Yeah, Jeannie! - Hey, Jeannie!

243
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,440
肖恩的演讲，是不是很精彩?
Wow, Sean's speech, wasn't it somethin'?

244
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
亲爱的?
Honey?

245
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,720
也许我们今晚就到此为止吧。
Maybe we should just, you know, call it a night.

246
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,380
不，宝贝，你去吧。
No, babe, you go ahead.

247
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,940
既然肖恩决定要来，我得把餐桌中心装饰好重新安排座位表。
I gotta finish these centerpieces and rearrange the seating chart now that Sean decided to show up.

248
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,150
汤姆!
Tom!

249
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,200
汤姆!
Tom!

250
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,160
我们做爱吧。
Let's have sex.

251
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,610
是的。是的。
Yes. Yes.

252
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,930
只是…只是…只是…只是给我…只是…我得赶紧吃完这些菠萝。
Just... Just... Just... Just gimme... Just... I just have to finish these pineapples real quick.

253
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:52,180
好的。嗯…但你真的必须现在就吃完菠萝吗?
Okay. Um... But do you really have to finish pineapples right now?

254
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,670
我的天啊。我爱穿t恤不穿裤子的你。
Oh, my God. I love you in a T-shirt and no pants.

255
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,550
我要到这儿来，这个高高的架子，这样我就能找点东西读了。
I'm just gonna reach over here, this high shelf, so I can get something to read.

256
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,160
当你够不到高架子的时候为什么这么性感?
Why is it so sexy when you can't reach high shelves?

257
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:19,020
所以,嗯…对不起，小姐，但那是…-就是这个吗?-不不不。
So, um... I'm sorry, miss, but it was... - It's this one here? - No, no, no.

258
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,070
就是那边的那个。
It's the one over there.

259
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,480
-先生，拜托。-哦，这个。
- Sir, please. - Oh, this one.

260
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,790
-这个。——是的。
- This one. - Yes.

261
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,200
——那?-谢谢，先生。
- That? - Thank you, sir.

262
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,340
好的。很高兴我能帮上忙。
Okay. Glad I could help.

263
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,190
我想你了。
I miss you.

264
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,690
好久不见了，是吧?
It's been a while, huh?

265
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,650
我知道。
I know.

266
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,860
我想你了。
I miss you.

267
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,790
我能问你一个问题吗?
Could I ask you a question?

268
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,880
这是个性感的问题吗?
Is it a sexy question?

269
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,380
嗯…只是想知道你为什么又取消了和肖恩的订婚。
Um... Just wondering why you called off the engagement with Sean again.

270
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,180
这一点都不性感。
That is so not sexy.

271
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,680
我…我告诉过你。
I... I told you this.

272
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,270
我们很年轻，我们在巴厘岛，然后有一天，我醒来，感觉不对劲。
We were young, we were in Bali, and then one day, I woke up and it just didn't feel right.

273
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,060
——好吗?——好的。
- Okay? - Okay.

274
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,190
但你答应了。
But you said yes.

275
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,010
是什么改变了你的想法?
You know, what changed your mind?

276
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,580
我不知道。
I don't know.

277
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:45,610
呃,他……他开始和我爸爸一起工作，他变了，他只关心地位和金钱。
Uh, he... he started working with my dad, he changed, and all he cared about was status and money.

278
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,630
话说回来，你为什么要在婚礼前夜谈论我的前任?
Anyway, why do you want to talk about my ex the night before our wedding?

279
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,820
我不知道。也许是因为你邀请他参加我们的婚礼?
I don't know. Maybe because you invited him to our wedding?

280
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,410
记住，我没有。
Remember, I didn't.

281
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,540
我爸爸让我邀请他。我该说什么?
My dad asked me to invite him. What was I supposed to say?

282
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,960
我不知道。呃,不是吗?
I don't know. Uh, no?

283
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,380
如果你没记错的话，我不想邀请任何人。
If you remember correctly, I didn't wanna invite anyone.

284
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,880
我想私奔。
I wanted to elope.

285
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,840
我同意传统婚礼的唯一原因是你说我们可以独处。
The only reason I agreed to a traditional wedding was because you said that we'd have moments alone.

286
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,190
嘿,你好。这是卡罗尔。
Hey, hello. It's Carol.

287
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,740
嗨。你好。
Hi. Hello.

288
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,060
你未来的岳母，卡罗尔。
Your future mother-in-law, Carol.

289
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,270
是的，我知道你的名字，卡罗尔。
Yep, I know your name, Carol.

290
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,780
我带了一些用来做欢迎包的多余的东西以防你想给肖恩做一个。
I brought some of the extras for the welcome bags in case you want to make one for Sean.

291
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,330
哦!哦。
Oh! Oh.

292
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,880
太好了。谢谢。
Great. Thanks.

293
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,780
好的，谢谢。
All right, thanks.

294
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,510
汤米，她没穿裤子。
Tommy, she's not wearing any pants.

295
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,040
我只是想问问…我希望你不会介意
I just want to ask, and... and I hope it's okay.

296
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,210
这是遗传，还是普拉提之类的?
Is that genetics, or is it, like, Pilates or something?

297
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,556
妈妈，现在不是说这个的时候。
Mom, now is not the time for this.

298
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,980
是的，好的。但是，我们得把你弄出去。
Yes, all right. But, you know, we need to get you outta here.

299
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,936
这是你婚礼的前一天晚上，你们不能在一起过夜。
It's the night before your wedding, and you can't spend the night together.

300
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,920
-不，妈，只是…-你不能。这会带来坏运气的。
- No, Ma, it's just... - You can't. It's bad luck.

301
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,800
他的表妹珍娜，她昨晚和她丈夫在一起。
You know, his cousin, Jenna, she spent the night with her husband.

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,030
你瞧，她得了莱姆病，现在不能穿凉鞋了。
Lo and behold, she got Lyme disease, and now she can't wear sandals.

303
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,700
这是传统。
It's a tradition.

304
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,940
哦。看看这对幸福的夫妇。
Oh. Look at the happy couple.

305
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,650
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

306
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,900
你应该给我做头发的。
You were supposed to do my hair.

307
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,220
现在鸟要在里面产卵了。
Now birds are gonna lay eggs in it.

308
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,180
我知道。我睡过头了。我很抱歉。
I know. I overslept. I'm sorry.

309
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,580
昨晚算是，算是和里奇上床了。
Kind of, sort of, slept with Ricky last night.

310
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,230
——瑞奇?——是的。我很抱歉。
- Ricky? - Yes. I'm sorry.

311
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,946
我只是，我想要一些东西，你知道，不太对。
I just, I was in the mood for something, you know, that wasn't quite right.

312
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,090
比如在寿司店点汉堡什么的。
Like ordering a hamburger at a sushi bar or something.

313
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,246
我今天要避开他。它很好。
I'm just gonna avoid him today. It's fine.

314
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,610
他是汤姆的伴郎。
He's Tom's best man.

315
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,590
你们俩得一起走上红毯。
You two have to walk down the aisle together.

316
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,990
我很擅长无视身边的人。
I am very good at ignoring people that I'm standing next to.

317
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,540
-不是开玩笑。——准备好了吗?
- No kidding. - Ready?

318
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,980
真不敢相信你居然同意穿卡萝尔的婚纱。
I can't believe you agreed to wear Carol's wedding dress.

319
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,520
好的。
Okay.

320
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,420
好吧,好吧。
Okay, okay.

321
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,560
无论如何，你看起来都很美。
You look beautiful, no matter what.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
她准备好了!
She's ready!

323
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,840
我们要不要来一轮龙舌兰?
Hey, should we all do a round of tequila shots?

324
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,430
我在裙子上加了防溅剂，尽量别吸入化学物质。
Well, I Scotchgarded the dress, so try not to inhale the chemicals.

325
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,350
面纱在哪里?面纱在哪里?
Where's the veil? Where's the veil?

326
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,680
好的。
Okay.

327
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,980
是的，龙舌兰酒。
Well, yes, tequila.

328
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,660
除非我们拿到瓶子，否则我不准备好。
Unless we get the bottle, I'm not set.

329
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,770
不，不喝龙舌兰。
No, no tequila.

330
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,110
哦!
Oh!

331
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,610
她们中最漂亮的。
The prettiest of them all.

332
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,130
你看起来比我们其他人好多了。
You look so much better than the rest of us.

333
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,900
这件衣服真漂亮。
This dress is just wonderful.

334
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,740
我在婚礼上穿过，珍妮在她的婚礼上穿过，现在你也要在你的婚礼上穿过。
I wore it for my wedding, Jeannie wore it for hers, and now you're gonna wear it for yours.

335
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,180
哦，天哪。
Oh, my gosh.

336
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,220
看看你。
Look at you.

337
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,960
这是用组织做成的白珊瑚。
Oh, it's white coral made out of tissue.

338
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,260
嗯…有些事情，你知道，感觉不对。
Um... Something doesn't, you know, feel right.

339
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,646
你觉得如果我们把面纱吹干，它会更蓬松吗?-好吧，我现在看到的是，我觉得左胸实际上稍微低一点
Do you think if we blew-dried the veil, - it would be more fluffy? - Okay, so what I'm seeing is, I think that the left boob is actually slightly lower

340
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,146
-而不是右胸。-像这样，像这样?
- than the right boob. - Like floof, floof, like that?

341
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,560
昨晚我身上发生了一些神奇的事。
Hey, something kinda magical happened with me last night.

342
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,400
理论上说……如果我们娶了姐妹会很奇怪还是很美好?
Theoretically speaking... would it be weird or wonderful if we married sisters?

343
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,790
是的,当然。
Yeah, sure.

344
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,990
嘿，嘘，拉里。汤姆很无聊。
Hey, psst, Larry. Tom's being boring.

345
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,570
来拍我后空翻!
Come film me doing a backflip!

346
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,210
哦,我……我觉得我不应该走路。
Oh, I... I don't think I should walk.

347
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
好吧。
All right.

348
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,570
它的时间。
It's time.

349
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
哇!
Wow!

350
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,470
看看你。
Look at you.

351
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,980
好的。
Okay.

352
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,190
你想谈谈。
You wanted to talk.

353
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,570
我知道现在是最后时刻。
I know it's last minute.

354
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,030
我只是…
I just...

355
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,410
我讨厌昨晚的结局，而且…我不希望我们的婚礼一开始就不顺利。
I hated the way things ended last night, and... And I didn't want our wedding day to start off on a bad note.

356
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,120
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

357
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,690
天啊，我以为你要取消了。
God, I thought you were calling it off.

358
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,280
取消婚礼?
Calling off the wedding?

359
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,530
——为什么?-我不知道。
- Why? - Uh, I don't know.

360
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,580
我是说，这个周末跟计划不太一样。
I mean, this weekend hasn't exactly gone to plan.

361
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,120
你和我过去几个月的争吵比我们在一起的头四年还多。
You and I have been arguing more in the last few months than we did our first four years together.

362
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,850
我不知道。我以为婚礼应该很有趣。
I don't know. I guess I thought weddings were supposed to be fun.

363
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,460
哦。好的。
Oh. Okay.

364
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,260
我很抱歉没能让你的婚礼更有趣。
Well, I'm sorry I didn't make your wedding more fun for you.

365
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,480
嗯,没有。这是……达西，这不是…
Well, no. That's... Darcy, that's not what...

366
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,400
这不是我的婚礼。这是我们的婚礼。
And it's not my wedding. It's our wedding.

367
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,360
几乎没有。
Hardly.

368
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,410
是的,汤姆。
Yeah, Tom.

369
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,480
你太关注婚礼了你变成了另一个人。
You got so fixated on the wedding that you... you turned into a different person.

370
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,640
我很抱歉。我只是希望一切都完美。
I'm sorry. I just wanted everything to be perfect.

371
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,900
为什么这对你这么重要?
Why is that so important to you?

372
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,530
为什么它对你不重要?
Why isn't it important to you?

373
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,566
就好像你根本不在乎婚礼一样。
It's like you don't even care about the wedding.

374
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,490
好吧,我……我当然在乎。
Well, I... Of course I care.

375
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,700
噢,是吗?
Oh, yeah?

376
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,181
是你坚持要我们为婚礼埋单的。
You're the one that insisted that we pay for this wedding.

377
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,620
可是我是那个跟供应商讨价还价的人什么都搞砸了，而你却一直在说"我不知道。看起来不错。”
Yet I'm the one that's bargaining with all the vendors and DIY-ing everything, and all you're saying is, "I don't know. It looks good,"

378
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,700
你知道，“听起来不错，汤姆。你想要什么都行。”
you know, "Sounds good, Tom. Whatever you want."

379
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,210
我告诉过你我不想要一场盛大的传统婚礼。
I told you that I did not want a big traditional wedding.

380
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,630
好吧?我不是什么娇羞的新娘。我是个成年女人了。
Okay? I'm not some blushing bride. I'm a grown woman.

381
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,970
我不想让我爸陪我走红毯。
I don't want my daddy walking me down the aisle.

382
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:33,310
我不需要大公主裙，当然也不需要结婚登记簿。
I don't need a big princess dress, and I certainly don't need a wedding registry.

383
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,020
我的东西已经准备好了。我喜欢我的东西。
I have my things already. I like my things.

384
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,730
我想要一台Roomba。
I wanted a Roomba.

385
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,820
她不在大厅里。
Well, she's not up in the lobby.

386
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,260
我的电话打不通。
I can't get through on my phone.

387
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,650
我的天啊。他们掉进沟里了。
Oh, my God. They've fallen in a ditch.

388
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,870
什么?你怎么知道的?
What? And how do you know that?

389
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
我不知道。
I don't know.

390
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,290
我对这种事有第六感。
I just have a sixth sense about these things.

391
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,796
艾斯和我去四处看看。
Ace and I will take a look around.

392
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,580
别担心。我们会找到他们的。
Don't worry. We will find them.

393
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,140
检查所有沟渠!- - -神。
- Check all ditches! - God.

394
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,170
我希望只有你和我在大海中央。
I wanted it to just be you and me in the middle of the ocean.

395
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,760
我说了400遍，那会害死我妈妈的。
And for the 400th time, that would've killed my mother.

396
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,470
啊。正确的。
Ugh. Right.

397
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,870
所以我才会穿着你妈妈的裙子头上还多了十磅头发。
And that's why I'm in your mother's dress with an extra 10 pounds of hair on my head.

398
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,870
但事实是，自从你求婚后我想要的东西你一件也没听进去。
But the truth is, you have not listened to one thing I wanted since you proposed.

399
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,520
好吧，达西，我听着呢。开导我。
Okay, well, Darcy, I'm listening. Enlighten me.

400
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,080
是什么?你想要什么?
What is it? What is it that you want?

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,820
汤姆,我们……我们谈过这个。
Tom, we've... We talked about this.

402
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,280
我们第一次约会的时候我就告诉过你，我不想要盛大的婚礼。
I told you on our very first date, I didn't want a big wedding.

403
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,010
我以为你改变主意了。
Well, I thought you changed your mind about that.

404
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,350
那你为什么还同意这么做?
Why did you even agree to do it then?

405
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,840
哦,我……我不…我不知道!
Oh, I... I don't... I don't know!

406
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,570
好吧?因为…因为我爱你。因为我……我w……我想让你幸福。
Okay? Because... Because I love you. Because I... I w... I wanted you to be happy.

407
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,720
走吧!快点，走!
Go! Come on, move!

408
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,890
每个人,动!来吧!
Everybody, move! Come on!

409
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,520
沿着。
Move along.

410
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,200
出去，马上出去。来吧。来吧。
Go outside, go outside right now. Come on. Come on.

411
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,210
如果你不想这么做，现在还不晚。
If you don't wanna go through with this, it's not too late.

412
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,830
什么?
What?

413
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,280
不。我们把所有我们爱的人都带到菲律宾参加我们的婚礼。
No. We brought everybody that we loved down to the Philippines for our wedding.

414
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,370
我穿着这条裙子!我们在做这个!
I'm in this dress! We're doin' this!

415
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,510
哦，太美了。这些是你的誓言吗?
Oh, that was beautiful. Are those your vows?

416
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,480
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

417
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,730
你说服了自己，我想取消婚礼，现在你却让我取消了。
You convinced yourself that I wanted to call off the wedding, and now you're making it happen.

418
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,470
哦，这就对了。让自己免于承担任何真正的责任。
Oh, there you go. Lawyering yourself out of any real responsibility.

419
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,490
你用戒指划伤了我!
You cut me with your ring!

420
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,370
不会再发生了。
Won't happen again.

421
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,920
太棒了!
Great!

422
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,260
你为什么不去和肖恩在一起?
Why don't you go be with Sean?

423
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,160
也许你们可以去找些老爷们!
Maybe you guys could go bang some grandpas!

424
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,300
我不知道为什么。我有不祥的预感。
I don't know why. I have a bad feeling about this.

425
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,880
会没事的，亲爱的。
It's gonna be fine, honey.

426
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,760
我觉得你可能反应过度了。
I think you might be overreacting.

427
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,350
不要动!趴下，趴下，趴下!
Hold still! Get down, get down, get down!

428
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,440
没有运行!
No running!

429
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,540
——每个人!-下来。
- Everyone! - Get down.

430
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,690
去游泳池!现在!
To the pool! Now!

431
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,070
第一排，开始!
First rows, go!

432
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,490
走，走，走!
Go, go, go!

433
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,700
大家，这边走!这种方式!
Everyone, this way! This way!

434
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,640
来吧!来吧!一行!我们走吧!
Come on! Come on! One line! Let's go!

435
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,780
我们走吧!
Let's go!

436
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,950
达西。
Darcy.

437
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,810
-伙计们，上!-去，去，上去。
- Guys, go! - Go, go, up there.

438
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,230
在那里!在那里!走吧!坚持到底。
Up there! Up there! Go! Go to the end.

439
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,980
-走，走!-大家快走!

440
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,360
-继续。-走吧。

441
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,610
走吧!
Go!

442
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,450
继续前进!好了。
Keep moving! There you go.

443
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,030
转弯。转弯。走吧!
Turn. Turn. Go!

444
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,320
-排队。-继续前进。
- Line up. - Keep moving.

445
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,530
排好队，开始!
Line up, go!

446
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,730
——现在!——没有。
- Now! - No.

447
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,830
然后进入游泳池。
And into the pool.

448
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,290
现在。走吧!
Now. Go!

449
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,370
进去。快点，快点，快点。
Go in. Faster, faster, faster.

450
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,500
-下水去。-我们开快点。
- Get in the water. - Let's go faster.

451
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,250
-放下手机。-但我的手机会毁了。
- Drop the phone. - But my phone will get ruined.

452
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,766
我想这就是重点，亲爱的。算了吧。
I think that's the point, sweetie. Just drop it.

453
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,976
是啊，但我有段时间没备份了。
Yeah, but I haven't backed it up in a while.

454
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
-放下!——好的。好的。
- Drop it! - Okay. Okay.

455
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,430
没必要害怕。
No need to be scared.

456
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,990
只要大家都听从指示，就没人会受伤。
As long as everybody follows directions, no one gets hurt.

457
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,990
听到你的名字时请举手。
Raise your hand when you hear your name.

458
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,450
罗伯特·里维拉。

459
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,340
罗伯特!罗伯特。
Robert! Robert.

460
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,420
他们在给你打电话。
They're calling you.

461
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,260
非常感谢，卡罗尔。
Thanks a lot, Carol.

462
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,310
-拉里·福勒。——现在。

463
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,880
我…我是卡罗尔，他的妻子。
I... I'm Carol, his wife.

464
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,720
这样你就不用跑两次了。
Just so you don't have to make two trips.

465
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,690
等待,等待。我要放在中间。
Wait, wait. I'd like it in the center.

466
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,450
肖恩·霍金斯。
Sean Hawkins.

467
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,410
如果你伤害了泳池里的任何人，你就得对我负责。
If you hurt anyone in this pool, you're gonna have to answer to me.

468
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,980
这是小组的英雄吗?
Is this the hero of the group?

469
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,700
是的。
Yes.

470
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,070
不。我的天啊。
No. Oh, my God.

471
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,960
总会有一个。
There is always one.

472
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,630
好吧。
All right.

473
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,560
新娘和新郎在哪里?
Where is bride and groom?

474
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,510
她在那里她不是新娘吗?
She's there. Isn't she the bride?

475
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
哦。不。
Oh. No.

476
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,970
阿曼达认为穿白色去参加婚礼是合适的。
Amanda thought it was appropriate to wear white to a wedding.

477
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,390
我不知道这是规定。
I didn't know that was a rule.

478
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,810
是的，你说了。
Yes, you did.

479
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,810
-你就是个煤气打火机。-是的。
- You're a gaslighter. - Yeah.

480
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,530
你看，这是个问题。
You see, this is a problem.

481
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,480
他们可以报警。如果警察来了，我们就杀了所有人。
They could call police. And if police come, we kill everyone.

482
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,070
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

483
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,490
好吧，我…仪式开始前，我看到汤姆朝自然步道走去，我注意到他的频率低得危险。
Okay, um, I... I saw Tom headed towards the nature walk before the ceremony, and I noticed that his frequency levels were dangerously low.

484
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,160
我想他临阵退缩了。
I think he's getting cold feet.

485
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,530
汤米临阵退缩?
Tommy has cold feet?

486
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,170
这真的是我们现在应该担心的吗?
Is this really what we should be worrying about at this point?

487
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,510
我是一位母亲。我可以同时担心很多事情。
I'm a mother. I can worry about a lot of things at the same time.

488
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,460
就像拉里的鼹鼠。
Like Larry's mole.

489
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,750
哦，没事的，亲爱的。
Oh, it's fine, sweetie.

490
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,380
-它越来越大了。-散开。
- It's getting bigger. - Spread out.

491
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,480
寻找他们。
Look for them.

492
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,450
嘿，呃，我…我…今天早上我给你发短信了，你都没回。
Hey, uh, I... I... I texted you this morning and I didn't hear anything back.

493
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,410
你是认真的吗?
Are you being serious right now?

494
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,560
不。不。
No. No.

495
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,980
达西!
Darcy!

496
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,090
达西!嘿!
Darcy! Hey!

497
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,450
不，不，不。达西。
No, no, no, no. Darcy.

498
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,990
-达西，我进来了-滚开，汤姆!
- Darcy, I'm coming in. - Fuck off, Tom!

499
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,260
哦，谢天谢地。
Oh, thank God.

500
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,850
听着，我知道你现在在生我的气，但你得让我了解你。
Listen, I know you're mad at me right now, but you have to let me in.

501
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,170
我为什么要生气?我太棒了。
Why would I be mad? I'm awesome.

502
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,690
我在一个热带岛屿上，我在吃液体早午餐，而且我不需要对任何人负责!
I'm on a tropical island, I'm having a liquid brunch, and I don't have to answer to anybody!

503
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,110
天啊，这是不可能的。
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

504
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,470
哦，正在发生，伙计。
Oh, it is happening, buddy.

505
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:32,560
好吧?等我把头发从头上弄下来，我就去海滩告诉大家你是怎么搞砸的!
Okay? And once I get this hair condo off my head, I'm gonna march down to that beach and tell everybody how you blew this up!

506
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,770
嘘……嘘!
Shh... shh!

507
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,080
你现在真的在嘘我吗?
Are you seriously shushing me right now?

508
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,290
搞什么鬼?
What the fuck?

509
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,670
那是血吗?
Is that blood?

510
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,990
现在没时间流血了。
There's no time for a blood freak-out right now.

511
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:52,540
别告诉我……外面有海盗，他们把所有人都扣为人质。
Don't tell me... There are pirates outside, and they took everybody hostage.

512
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
什么?
What?

513
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,450
-我们得找人帮忙-不，不。不。不。
- We have to get help. - No, no. No. No.

514
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,900
-电话没电了。-还有Wi-Fi。
- The phone is dead. - Oh, the Wi-Fi too.

515
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,300
马姬说北边的手机信号比较好。
Marge said the cell service is better on the north side.

516
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,230
你为什么要选一个没有手机信号的岛?
Why did you pick an island with no cell service?

517
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,116
因为我想让人们活在当下。
Because I wanted people to be present and in the moment.

518
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,880
呀!
Jeez!

519
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,370
我不能呼吸了。我不能呼吸了!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

520
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,330
我知道。我也不。
I know. Me neither.

521
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,200
不。我…我真的不能呼吸了。是塑身衣的问题。
No. I... I really can't breathe. It's the shapewear.

522
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,040
请帮我脱下这条裙子。
Please help me get out of this dress now.

523
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,290
现在!
Now!

524
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,500
你能放松点吗?
Would you relax?

525
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,040
你刚才跟我说什么?
What did you just say to me?

526
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,556
我说了一切都会好起来的。
I said everything's gonna be okay.

527
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,880
衣服就像一个谜语。
Dress is like a riddle.

528
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,420
哦!
Oh!

529
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,570
天啊，我穿这裙子会死的!
God, I'm gonna die in this dress!

530
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,930
哦，门锁是从里面开的。
Oh, door latches from the inside.

531
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,060
他会知道我们在这里。
He's gonna know we're in here.

532
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,890
当他进来的时候，他也会知道我们在这里，我们在这里。
He's also gonna know we're in here when he comes in here and we're in here.

533
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,370
他会以为我们在洗澡。
He'll think we're in the shower.

534
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,900
什么……什么?
What... What?

535
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,440
然后在一个更好的时间回来?留个便条?
And come back at a better time? Leave a note?

536
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
好吧。
All right.

537
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,700
好的,h……计划是这样的。他进来了，他会以为我们在洗澡，然后我跳出来，把他困在网里。
Okay, h... here's the plan. He comes in, he's gonna think we're in the shower, then I jump out and I trap him in the net.

538
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,130
天啊，这计划太棒了。
Oh, my God, that's an amazing plan.

539
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,230
——是的!——不!
- Yes! - No!

540
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,666
你要在海盗身上撒网吗?
You're gonna throw a net over a pirate?

541
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,916
你试过从网里逃出来吗?
Have you ever tried to get out of a net?

542
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,256
很难从网里出来。
It's very hard to get out of a net.

543
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,910
好的。如何……这个怎么样?我喷了他的眼睛。
Okay. How about... How about this? I spray him in the eyes.

544
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,670
眼睛里的发胶怎么比头上的发网好?
How is hairspray in the eyes better than a net over his head?

545
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,050
等等!是的，那实际上是…这实际上是……喷一下。
Wait! Yes, that's actually... That's actually... You spray that.

546
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,186
我来点火柴。就像火焰喷射器一样。
I'll light the match. It'll be like a flamethrower.

547
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,410
-我是说，没用的!——为什么?
- I mean, it won't work! - Why?

548
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,970
-步骤太多。-只有两步。
- Too many steps. - It's two steps.

549
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,720
这是两步。火焰喷射器,净。
It's two steps. Flamethrower, net.

550
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,020
我跳了出来，把网盖在他头上。我要给他一个惊喜。
I pop out and I put the net over his head. I'll surprise him.

551
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,230
不，汤姆，因为子弹是穿网的!
No, Tom, because bullets shoot through nets!

552
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,980
-严格来说，是的。——技术?
- Technically, yeah. - Technically?

553
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,900
从技术上讲，他不能直接投篮，因为他会被网缠住。
Technically, he won't be able to shoot straight because he'll be all fuckin' wrapped up in the net.

554
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,400
我对天发誓，如果你再说一遍"net"…
I swear to God, if you say "net" one more time...

555
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,510
我的天啊。我的天啊。我的天啊。
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

556
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,720
嘘。火焰喷射器。
Psst. Flamethrower.

557
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,060
我要操死他。
I'm gonna fuck him up.

558
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,270
我要操死他。
I'm gonna fuck him up.

559
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,840
他妈的!
Fuck!

560
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,550
噢!
Ow!

561
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,476
-没关系!不要紧。-你为什么这么做?
- Never mind! Never mind. - Why did you do that?

562
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,110
没关系!
Never mind!

563
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,480
你说得对。
You were right.

564
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,620
发胶比发胶差多了。
That hairspray was so much worse than the net.

565
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,900
——噢!-起来。
- Ow! - Get up.

566
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
好的。
Okay.

567
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,990
-来吧。-别掐我。
- Come on. - Don't strangle me.

568
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,200
-转动你的手臂。-他们还活着。
- Turn your arm. - I have them alive.

569
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,410
等待,等待。什么?
Wait, wait. What?

570
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,180
平房15。来接我。
Bungalow 15. Pick me up.

571
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,810
去收集它们吧。
Go collect them.

572
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,020
然后我们可以开始了。
And then we can begin.

573
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,990
你还好吗，杰米?
You doing okay, Jamie?

574
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,480
我的肚子好像要从屁眼里掉下去了。
My stomach feels like it's gonna fall through my asshole.

575
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,370
但除此之外，我很冷静。
But otherwise, I'm chill.

576
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,020
听着，感到害怕很正常。
Listen, it's normal to feel scared.

577
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:48,920
但我不会让你和你的家人出事的。的承诺。
But I'm not gonna let anything happen to you or your family. Promise.

578
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,710
嗨,肖恩?
Hey, Sean?

579
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,700
我也感到害怕。
I am also feeling scared.

580
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,876
这是我这辈子最害怕的一次。
Like the most scared I've ever been in my whole life.

581
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,090
就像我刚看了《指环王》一样?
It's like I just watched The Ring, you know?

582
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,000
罗比，宝贝，我要你练习我们在伊萨兰学会的呼吸练习，好吗?
Robbie, baby, I want you to practice the breathing exercise that we learned at Esalen, okay?

583
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,400
我要击中一个压力点。准备好了吗?和…呼吸。呼吸。
I'm gonna hit a pressure point. Ready? And... Breathe. Breathe.

584
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,230
从隔膜开始。
From the diaphragm.

585
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,516
-我想我要吐了。-没关系。你做得很好。
- I think I'm gonna throw up now. - It's okay. You're doing fine.

586
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,220
如果他继续发出那种声音，就开枪吧。
If he keeps making that noise, just go ahead and shoot me.

587
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,030
那对幸福的情侣马上就到。
The happy couple will be here in a second.

588
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,310
让我们进入正题。
So let's get to business.

589
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,370
新娘的父亲在哪里?
Where is the father of the bride?

590
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,330
罗伯特。他又给你打电话了。
Robert. He's calling ya again.

591
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,260
谢谢你,卡罗。
Thanks, Carol.

592
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,840
好吧，你想要什么?
Okay, what do you want?

593
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:47,420
我们用卫星电话给我同事打电话，然后你把四千五百万美元转到一个银行账户上。
Well, we call my colleague on the satellite phone, and you transfer $45 million to a bank account.

594
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,000
什么?什么?
What? What?

595
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
我没有那么多钱。
I don't have that kind of money.

596
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,340
我们在谷歌上搜过你。净资产为6000万美元。
We googled you. Net worth is $60 million.

597
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,490
在确定我女儿是否安全之前，我什么都不会给你。
I'm not giving you anything until I find out if my daughter's safe.

598
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,740
-还有你的女婿。-是的，他也是。
- And your son-in-law. - Yeah, him too.

599
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,470
好的。
Okay.

600
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,240
我可以等两分钟把你的钱都拿走。
I can wait two minutes to take all your money.

601
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,000
这种方式。
This way.

602
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,980
你要菠萝糖吗?
You want some pineapple candies?

603
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,440
是我们买的那个奇怪的欢迎包里的，但我在口袋里找到的。
They're from that weird welcome bag we got, but I found them in my pocket.

604
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,090
不，我不想要你恶心口袋里又湿又松的糖果。
No, I don't want loose, wet candy from your gross pockets.

605
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,760
好的。
Okay.

606
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,800
随便你。
Suit yourself.

607
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,210
好的。好吧，好吧，好吧。
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

608
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,410
-我饿死了。——没有。
- I'm starving. - No.

609
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,050
-你是个混蛋。——嗯。
- You're an asshole. - Hmm.

610
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,090
天啊，真不敢相信我和你上床了。
God, I can't believe that I had sex with you.

611
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,450
说实话，我也很惊讶。
Honestly, I was pretty surprised by that too.

612
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,870
我父母在我上高中的时候离婚了，我的第一次订婚是场灾难。
My parents, they got divorced when I was in high school, and my first engagement was a disaster.

613
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,770
你呢?你有约会对象吗?
What about you? Are you dating anyone?

614
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,366
你一直想当海盗吗?
Have you always wanted to be a pirate?

615
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,370
别再说了，女士。
No more talk, lady.

616
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,740
对不起，先生们。
Excuse me, sirs.

617
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,140
达西，他们会伤害你的。
Darcy, they're gonna hurt you.

618
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,290
我只是忍不住注意到你们身上有股烟味，我很喜欢。
I just can't help but notice that you guys smell like cigarettes, and I am loving it.

619
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,790
能给我支烟吗?
Is there any way I could bum a cigarette?

620
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,216
我是说，我觉得这可能对…我现在所经历的恐慌和恐惧
I mean, I think it might help with the... the panic and dread I'm experiencing right now.

621
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,516
你什么时候开始抽烟了?
Since when do you smoke cigarettes?

622
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,650
这是……我只是…你都不用解开我的手。
It's... I just... You don't even have to untie my hands.

623
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,930
我是说，我…我不用手也能抽烟。
I mean, I... I can smoke with no hands.

624
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,350
你可以直接放进我嘴里。
You could just put it right in my mouth.

625
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,560
给她一支烟。
Give her a cigarette.

626
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,310
——请。-也许能让她闭嘴
- Please. - Maybe it will shut her up.

627
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,240
对，对，对，这能让我闭嘴。
Yes, yes, yes, it will shut me up.

628
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,620
哦，谢谢。
Oh, thank you.

629
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,170
你们是…最好的
You guys are the... best.

630
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,780
什么?
What?

631
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,970
火!
Fire!

632
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,990
哦，天哪!
Oh, my God!

633
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,080
哦，天哪!火焰喷射器!
Oh, my God! Flamethrower!

634
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,230
哦,我的……看，这就是为什么你只有一个步骤的计划!
Oh, my... See, that's why you only have a plan with one step!

635
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,340
——不!-我的天啊!
- No! - Oh, my God!

636
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,650
-刹车!-我在努力!我尝试!
- Get the brakes! - I'm trying! I'm trying!

637
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,640
悬崖!
Cliff!

638
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,060
——悬崖!悬崖!-我看到了!
- Cliff! Cliff! - I see it!

639
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,480
把它开进停车场!
Get it into park!

640
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,540
我尝试!
I'm trying!

641
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,070
-天啊!哦，天哪!——上帝!
- Oh, God! Oh, my God! - God!

642
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,210
哦，滑出去!
Oh, slide out!

643
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,330
我的衣服!我的衣服，汤姆!
My dress! My dress, Tom!

644
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,700
汤姆，别松手!
Tom, don't let go!

645
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,850
别松手!
Don't you let go!

646
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,310
我困了!我困了!
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!

647
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,230
走吧!
Go!

648
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,420
走了。走，走，走。走，走，走。
Go. Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

649
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,030
快点，做点跟棒球有关的事。
Quick, do something baseball-y.

650
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,220
什么?这一点也不像棒球!
What? This is nothing like baseball!

651
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,970
——下!下来,下来!——操!
- Down! Down, down! - Fuck!

652
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,790
-他没子弹了。——正确的。
- He's out of ammo. - Right.

653
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,350
-冲向他!——什么?
- Run at him! - What?

654
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,250
——走吧。相信我，走吧!-不不不!
- Go. Believe me, just go! - No, no, no!

655
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,940
——手榴弹!-他有手榴弹!
- Grenade! - He has a grenade!

656
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,860
先生!
Sir!

657
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,350
先生,先生。
Sir, sir.

658
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,020
把手榴弹给我，长官，长官!
Give me the grenade, sir. Sir!

659
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,980
长官，把手榴弹给我。先生,先生!
Sir, give me the grenade. Sir. Sir!

660
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Ah-ow。噢!
Ah-ow. Ow!

661
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,540
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

662
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,720
-他死了吗?-我不知道。
- Is he dead? - I don't know.

663
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,430
你死了吗?
Are you dead?

664
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,300
是啊，他死气沉沉。
Oh, yeah, he's very not alive.

665
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,390
不是活着。哦,男孩。
Not alive. Oh, boy.

666
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,390
——是的!你杀了他!——是的!
- Yes! You killed him! - Yeah!

667
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,640
是的，我杀了他!我杀了他!
Yeah, I killed him! I killed him!

668
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,400
天啊，我杀了个人。
Oh, my God, I killed a man.

669
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,190
我杀了一个人。不。
I killed a man. No.

670
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,400
你感觉如何?
How do you feel?

671
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,610
我觉得……我的天啊。我感觉糟透了。
I feel... Oh, my God. I feel horrible.

672
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,120
-是的。-但很兴奋。
- Yeah. - But excited.

673
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,400
你知道，就像，快乐。我都要拉裤子了。
You know, like, happy. Like, I'm gonna shit my pants.

674
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,910
-是的。-你知道的，不过是好的方面。你知道吗?
- Yeah. - You know, like, but in a good way. You know?

675
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,220
嗯。
Huh.

676
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,760
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

677
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,080
我要进监狱了。
I'm gonna go to prison.

678
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
-我要…——不!
- I'm gonna... - No!

679
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,000
-是的。——没有。这是……它……这是正当防卫。他想杀了我们。
- Yeah. - No. It was... It... It was self-defense. He was trying to kill us.

680
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,030
任何法庭都会…任何法院……你还好吗?
Any court would... Any court... Are you okay?

681
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,760
是的。我很好。我很好。
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

682
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,600
只是，你知道，我看了看那里，看到了所有的血。
It's just, you know, I looked over there and I saw all the blood.

683
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,400
你知道，我想我看到了一些大脑。
And, you know, I think I saw some brain.

684
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,140
-是大脑的问题吗?-是的。是的。
- Was that brain stuff? - Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,900
所以我要抬头看看天空，然后……这样我就不会晕过去了
And so I'm just gonna look up at the sky and... so I don't pass out.

686
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,180
好的。你知道吗?也许我们应该……我们先离开现场吧。
Okay. Well, you know what? Maybe we should... Let's just step away from the scene.

687
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,366
-别往下看。——好的。
- And don't look down. - Okay.

688
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,590
——好的。-别往下看。
- Okay. - Just don't look down.

689
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,370
他们现在应该到了。
They should be here by now.

690
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,570
沿着路往前走。
Head up the road.

691
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,930
-检查他们。-是的。
- Check on them. - Yeah.

692
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,790
好吧。我们得离开这个岛。
All right. We need to get off this island.

693
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:26,920
我给我们弄到这个手榴弹可能会有帮助。
Well, it might help that I got this grenade for us.

694
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,380
他想把我们炸飞，但我懂了。
I mean, he was trying to blow us up, but I got it.

695
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,740
我明白了。达西又得一分。
I got it. Another point for Darcy.

696
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,850
好了,达西。
Okay, Darcy.

697
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:44,730
嗯…你还记得那次我们在高速公路上开车你非常冷静地让我靠边停车吗?
Uh... Do you remember that time that we were driving down the highway and you very calmly told me to pull over?

698
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,250
你等到我们靠边停车才告诉我我头上有只大蜘蛛?
And you waited until we pulled over to tell me that there was a giant spider on my head?

699
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,110
是的。是的。
Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,590
是啊，你真聪明。
Yeah, well, that was very smart.

701
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,410
因为如果你早告诉我，我可能会惊慌失措，把车撞坏。
Because if you had told me before, I might have panicked and crashed the car.

702
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,876
等待。我头上有只蜘蛛吗?
Wait. Is there a spider on my head?

703
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,300
不，不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

704
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:06,650
不,不。我告诉你这个故事是因为…当我告诉你我将要告诉你的事情时，我不想让你惊慌。
No, no. I tell you this story because... I don't want you to panic when I tell you what I'm about to tell you.

705
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,360
你的手榴弹没有销子。
Your grenade doesn't have a pin.

706
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,890
-什么意思?——嗯…嗯，是…它是……会爆炸吗?
- What does that mean? - Well... Well, is it... is it... is it gonna explode?

707
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,770
不，不，不，不。不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

708
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,040
你怎么拿就怎么拿。很好。好。
Hold it exactly how you're holding it. Good. Good.

709
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,270
——好的。好的。——嗯。
- Okay. Okay. - Mm-hmm.

710
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,400
那个别针把把手固定住了。
That pin holds the handle on.

711
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:34,460
但当你松开手雷，手柄就会弹开，引信就会点燃，整个事情就会……繁荣。
But when you let go of the grenade, the handle pops off, which lights the fuse, and the whole thing goes... boom.

712
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,340
你怎么这么了解手榴弹?
How do you know so much about grenades?

713
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,080
视频游戏。
Video games.

714
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,126
那我该怎么办呢?应该……我应该扔吗?
So what should I do? Should... Should I throw it?

715
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,710
我担心的是你不能把它扔得足够远而不把我们炸飞。
Well, my concern is that you won't be able to throw it far enough to not blow us up.

716
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,810
-无意冒犯。- - -神。
- No offense. - God.

717
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,460
那又怎样，我只是…我就拿着这个手榴弹?
So, what, I just... I just hold this live grenade?

718
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,590
这手榴弹现在是我生活的一部分了吗?
This grenade is just part of my life now?

719
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,150
是的，现在，是的，是的，是的。
Yeah, for now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,490
好吧，计划是这样的。
Okay, here's the plan.

721
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,810
我们去拿把刀。
We're gonna get a knife.

722
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,366
——好的。好吧。-我要切断这些联系，我们要把手榴弹处理掉，然后我们要去码头。
- Okay. All right. - I'm gonna cut through these ties, we're gonna get rid of that grenade, and then we're gonna head down to the docks.

723
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,620
我们要冲向守卫它的海盗，跳上一艘船，去下一个岛求救。
We're gonna bum-rush the pirate guarding it, hop in a boat, and head to the next island for help.

724
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:16,010
——好吗?-汤姆，那个计划…有太多的步骤。我现在明白了。
- Okay? - Tom, that plan... Has too many steps. I see that now.

725
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,720
你有更简单的吗?
Now, you got a simpler one?

726
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,330
——是的。是的。——什么?
- Yes. Yes. - What?

727
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,290
——是的。好的。-你在干什么?
- Yes. Okay. - What are you doing?

728
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,000
快下来。找到了。
Get down here. Found it.

729
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,640
-找到了。是的。-我们在做什么?
- Found it. Yes. - What are we doing?

730
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,380
-就在这儿。-我们在做什么?
- Right here. - What are we doing?

731
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,650
哦。
Oh.

732
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,310
哦。
Oh.

733
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,840
找手机服务。寻求帮助。
Find cell service. Call for help.

734
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
你什么时候把它放进内裤里的?
When did you put that in your underwear?

735
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,686
就在海盗把我们带出小屋之前。
Right before the pirates took us out of the cabana.

736
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,430
因为我是个鬼鬼祟祟的小婊子。
Because I'm a sneaky little bitch.

737
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,030
你这个鬼鬼祟祟的小婊子。
Oh, you are a sneaky little bitch.

738
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,980
谢谢你！
Thank you.

739
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,560
——好的。-我们开始走吧。
- Okay. - Let's start walking.

740
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,540
卑鄙的。狡猾的小婊子。
Sneaky. Sneaky little bitch.

741
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,530
你在考验我的耐心，罗伯特!
You're testing my patience, Robert!

742
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,166
你想要我的钱?我要我的女儿。
Look, you want my money? I want my daughter.

743
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,670
-这是一个简单的谈判。——够了!
- It's a simple negotiation. - Enough!

744
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,850
好吧。
All right.

745
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,980
他们要把他带回来。
They're bringing him back.

746
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
移动。
Move.

747
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,410
罗伯特。发生了什么事?你还好吗?
Robert. What happened? Are you okay?

748
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,716
他们没伤害你吧?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

749
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,920
在确定我女儿还活着之前我一分钱都不会给他们。
Well, I'm not giving them a dime till I know my daughter's alive.

750
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,850
结果不太好。
That didn't go over very well.

751
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,670
我担心他们会开始射杀人质。
I'm afraid they're gonna start shooting the hostages.

752
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,976
我不认为他们会那么做。
I don't think they're gonna do that.

753
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,810
这不正是海盗的工作吗?
Isn't that exactly what pirates do?

754
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,910
出来吧，海盗先生!
Come out, Mr. Pirate Man!

755
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,470
我叫卡罗尔·伊莱恩·福勒，我活该。
My name is Carol Elaine Fowler, and I deserve to live.

756
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,450
卡罗尔，你在做什么?
Carol, what are you doing?

757
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,040
我把自己人性化了。
I'm humanizing myself.

758
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,750
我在《早安美国》上看到的。
I saw it on Good Morning America.

759
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,520
如果你在他们面前表现出人性，他们就会让你活着。
If you humanize yourself to them, they let you live.

760
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,730
我是一个妻子。我是一位母亲。
I am a wife. I am a mother.

761

1998年，我是密歇根州米尔福德的顶级房地产经纪人，2007年又一次。
And I was Milford, Michigan's top realtor in 1998, and again in 2007.

我梦想去爱尔兰。
I dream of going to Ireland.

763
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,710
我大器晚成，直到14岁才长出牙齿。
I was a late bloomer and my teeth didn't come in till I was 14.

764
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,380
请选我。
Please pick me.

765
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,540
我叫珍妮·里德。
My name is Jeannie Reed.

766
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,220
我是个尽职的母亲，但不那么尽职的妻子。
I am a devoted mother and a slightly less devoted wife.

767
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:30,620
这是我第一次没有孩子的假期，所以我在婚礼前喝了很多香槟，吃了几片大麻软糖，这些组合现在真的要了我的命。
This is my first vacation without my kids, so I drank a lot of champagne before the ceremony, took a couple of weed gummies, and the combination is really killing me right now.

768
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,920
我是阿曼达·沃克。我是教母，也是科技行业的女性。
I'm Amanda Walker. I'm a godmother and a woman in tech.

我有一头漂亮的头发。
I have beautiful hair.

772
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
是的。非常漂亮。
Yeah. Very beautiful.

773
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,820
还有什么?
What else?

774
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,580
你是个母亲。
You're a mother.

775
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,910

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,570
我的很多朋友，他们都成双成对，他们结婚了喝散装茶叶什么的。
A lot of my friends, they're pairing up, and they're getting married and drinking loose-leaf tea and shit.

778
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:06,970
我还是单身。但是昨晚……我和一个美丽可怕的女人做爱了。
And I'm still single. But last night... I made love to a gorgeous and terrifying woman.

779
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:08,800
你觉得我很可怕?
You think I'm terrifying?

780
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,640
你吓死我了。
You scare the shit out of me.

781
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,150
我是拉里·福勒。
I'm Larry Fowler.

782
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,950
哦……谢谢你！
Oh... Thank you.

783
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:28,910
——哦。-别紧张，爸爸。
- Oh. - Oh, easy, Dad.

784
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,366
-别挂电话。是的。-我怎么能…-稳住。-等等。等一等。
- Hold the phone. Yes. - How am I gonna... - Hold it steady. - Hold it. Hold on.

785
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,690
我得把这事从脑子里赶出去。
I just gotta get this thing out of my head.

786
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,650
快把我逼疯了。
It's driving me crazy.

787
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:44,660
——等待。等一等。只是等待。-你在…你在…你是在往我口袋里塞头发吗?
- Wait. Hold on. Just wait. - What are you... What are you... Are you stuffing a loose wad of hair in my pocket?

788
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,370
是的。一团非常昂贵的定制头发，我想留着。
Yes. A loose wad of very expensive, custom-made hair that I would like to keep.

789
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,890
如果我们能活下来。
If we survive.

790
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,020
有什么好笑的?
What's so funny?

791
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,800
-我只是…-嗷，嗷，嗷!
- I've just been... - Ow, ow, ow!

792
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,550
质疑最近的一切。
Questioning everything lately.

793
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,680
如果婚礼不完美怎么办?如果你父母从来都不喜欢我怎么办?
What if the wedding's not perfect? What if your parents never like me?

794
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,890
棒球之后的生活是什么样子?
What does life look like after baseball?

795
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:13,080
但我从没想过自己会带着手铐在丛林里走，手里还拿着一颗手榴弹。
But not once did I wonder if I'd be walking handcuffed through the jungle with a live grenade.

796
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,900
哦。你的愿景板上没有海盗追你吗?
Oh. Pirates chasing you wasn't on your vision board?

797
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,210
你是我梦想板上唯一的东西。
Well, you were the only thing on my vision board.

798
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,826
-我来，我来，我来——哦!哦!
- I got it, I got it, I got it. - Oh! Oh!

799
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:26,496
-明白了吗?明白了吗?-我知道了。我明白了。
- You got it? You got it? - I got it. I got it.

800
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,340
——好的。我明白了。-哦，很好。好的。哦。
- Okay. I got it. - Oh, good. Okay. Oh.

801
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,510
-我们有酒吧。-哦，很好。
- We have a bar. - Oh, good.

802
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,220
好吧。
All right.

803
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,730
-手跟着我。——好的。
- Keep your hands with me. - Okay.

804
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,380
——好的。-打电话求助。
- Okay. - Call for help.

805
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,440
是的。狗屎!这是一去不复返了。
Yes. Shit! It's gone.

806
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,020
好吧，继续努力。
Well, keep trying.

807
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,830
-我想，也许…-我们得再高一点。
- I think, maybe... - We have to go higher.

808
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,200
——什么?——是的。
- What? - Yes.

809
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,240
不是……不。不，不，不。我不喜欢高的。
Not... No. No, no, no. Uh, I don't like higher.

810
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,166
是的，我不……我不认为这东西是按代码建造的。
Yeah, I don't... I don't think this thing is built to code.

811
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,620
——汤姆。——什么?
- Tom. - Anything?

812
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,680
不。来吧。
No. Come on.

813
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,580
-是的。-我们快到山顶了。
- Yeah. - We're almost at the top.

814
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,710
也许我们应该往下走，这样我们就不会那么高了。
Maybe we should go back down so we're not up so high.

815
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,670
现在不要考虑高度。好吧?我们是安全的。
Don't think about the heights right now. Okay? We're safe.

816
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,890
是的。你用"安全"这个词太随便了。
Yeah. You use the word "safe" very loosely.

817
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,020
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

818
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,226
-全方位服务。完整的服务。-哦，是的。
- Full service. Full service. - Oh, yes.

819
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,390
我有全套服务。
I have full service.

820
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,686
哇，哇，哇。沉默。
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Silence it.

821
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,390
我尝试。
I'm trying.

822
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,190
你的群聊失控了。
Your group chat is out of control.

823
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,470
我不会因为有热情的朋友而道歉。
I will not apologize for having enthusiastic friends.

824
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,030
哦!你把它弄掉了。
Oh! You dropped it.

825
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,960
来吧!
Come on!

826
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,160
-我们得快点。——邮政吗?
- We gotta zip. - Zip?

827
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,590
"拉链"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "zip"?

828
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,620
哦!邮政编码。哦,上帝!
Oh! Zip. Oh, God!

829
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,010
走，走，走。
Go, go, go.

830
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,520
不，我认为我们没有合适的设备。
No, I don't think we have the proper equipment.

831
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,040
他们有枪。
Well, they have guns.

832
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,426
有什么手册吗?
Is there some kind of a manual?

833
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,450
下来!
Come down!

834
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,920
我们需要头盔。我在照片里看到很多头盔。
We need helmets. I see lots of helmets in the photos.

835
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,440
为什么他们看起来很害怕?
And then why do they look scared?

836
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,150
别想那么多。跳!
Stop thinking so much. Jump!

837
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,480
-别尖叫!-天啊!哦，天哪!
- Stop screaming! - Oh, God! Oh, my God!

838
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,810
哇!
Whoa!

839
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,060
汤姆，别放手。
Tom, don't let go.

840
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,210
他妈的!
The fuck!

841
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,110
坚持住，宝贝。等一等。
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

842
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,470
好的。
Okay.

00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,690
嗯…——是的!——是的!
Uh... - Yeah! - Yeah!

844
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,130
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

845
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:57,950
哦,上帝!
Oh, God!

846
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,190
-天啊!-我们怎么降落?
- Oh, God! - How do we land this thing?

847
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,730
我第一次。我先说。
Me first. I'm gonna go first.

848
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:06,730
-那我呢?-不，让我来。我第一次。
- What about me? - No, let me. Me first.

849
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,400
我要跳了。我要跳了。
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.

这些人都有病。
These people are sick.

854
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,150
你去找他们，我来杀他们。
You find them, but I kill them.

855
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,630
你可以娶他，但新娘是我的。
You can have the man, but the bride is mine.

856
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,460
警察，海岸警卫队，他们都在那里。
Police, coast guard, they're all right there.

857
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,046
-我们怎么过去?-我不知道。
- How do we get across? - I don't know.

858
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,540
好吧，我们来玩两真一假的游戏。
Okay, let's all go around and play two truths and a lie.

859
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,740
安静点!
Be quiet!

860
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,020
-卡罗尔。——妈妈。

861
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,860
一件容易的事。

00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:15,940
来，来，来。
Come on, come on, come on.

864
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,350
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

865
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,870
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

866
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,120
我会解决的。
I'm gonna fix this.

867
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,490
我可怜的妈妈。

她以为她整个周末都能躲着我爸。

我妈妈以前很爱我爸爸。
My mom used to love my dad so much.

870
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:43,660
他是她的整个世界。

871
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,600
当他离开时，她失去了快乐。
Then when he left, she just lost her joy.

872
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,230
我是说，她表现得很强硬，但是…
I mean, she acts tough, but...

873
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,610
她从未真正恢复过来。
she never really recovered.

874
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,610
-达西，对不起…-我知道。

876
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,430

- Oh. Mmm. - What... What... What are you doing?

我饿死了。你今天吃饭了吗?

不，我不饿。

00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,220
好吧，来吧。
Okay, come on.

887
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,120
来吧。噢!简单,容易。
Come on. Ow! Easy, easy.

888
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,500
我不能单手切东西。
I can't cut with one hand.

889
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,260
我没手可切不动。
Well, I can't cut with no hands.

890
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,630
我们得找点别的。
We need to find something else.

891
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,900
好吗?
Okay?

892
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,980
切割塑料的东西。
Something that cuts through plastic.

893
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,280
嗯…
Hmm...

894
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,910
是的。
Yep.

895
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,310
-这是个坏主意吗?-是的。
- Is this a bad idea? - Yeah.

896
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,290
-准备好了吗?——不!
- You ready? - No!

897
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,920
好的。
Okay.

898
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,380
好了。
There you go.

899
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,530
坚持住，坚持住，坚持住!
Hang on, hang on, hang on!

900
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:43,740
达西，你在拖延时间。

- Yes. - Ten, nine, eight... Why are you counting from ten?

905
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,570
这是什么，火箭发射?
What is this, a rocket launch?

906
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,700
好的,很好。四。
Okay, fine. On four.

907
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,220
一、二、三……没人能走到四。

911
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,800
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

912
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,680
来吧。
Come on.

913
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:06,800
汤姆!
Tom!

914
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,840
汤姆。
Tom.

915
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,650
我以为你走了。
I thought you left.

916
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,190
什么?
What?

917
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,650
不。
No.

918
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,530
从来没有。
Never.

919
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,330
你妈妈的刀去哪儿了?
Where'd your mom's knife go?

920
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,510
天啊，帮帮我。
Oh, Jesus, help me.

921
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,270
这很好。
That's good.

922
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,940
把那双靴子扔给我。
Throw me those boots.

923
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
什么?
What?

924
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,800
我越来越喜欢那件衣服了。
That dress is growing on me.

925
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,640
谢谢。
Thanks.

926
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,010
我想要一些不那么传统的东西。
I wanted something less traditional.

927
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,170
是的。也许玛吉有有线网络。
Yes. Maybe Margy's got a hard line to the Internet.

928
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,300
哇，玛吉喜欢柯基狗。
Wow, does Margy love corgis.

929
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,850
不。该死的。
No. Damn it.

930
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,620
你去那边，我去这边。
You go over there, I'll go here.

931
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,080
-是的。-就在那儿。
- Yeah. - They're right there.

932
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,770
-我该怎么办?-我不知道。
- What do I do? - I don't know.

933
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,560
我不知道。
I don't know.

934
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,670
-哦，玛吉。-这边。
- Oh, Margy. - This way.

935
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:10,900
走，走，走。
Go, go, go.

936
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,260
好的。我抓住你了。
Okay. I got you.

937
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,280
没关系。没关系。
It's okay. It's okay.

938
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,120
来了。快,快。
Come. Faster, faster.

939
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,690
Ace,马吉·…-这是你的地堡吗?——嗯。
Ace, Margy... - Is this your bunker? - Uh-huh.

940
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,906
-男人洞。-它在旋转吗?
- Man cave. - Is it spinning?

941
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:26,170
它在为其他人旋转吗?
Is it spinning for anyone else?

942
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,980
你在失血。坐下来。
You're losing blood. Sit down.

943
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,610
-坐下。好的。——绷带。Ace。
- Sit down. Okay. - Bandages. Ace.

944
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,360
我去拿医疗箱
I'll get the medical kit.

945
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,070
把手给我。我要把它包起来。
Give me your hand. I'm gonna wrap it.

946
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:36,090
不。不，不，不。不。
No. No, no, no. No.

947
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,180
你确定吗?很恶心。
Are you sure? It's disgusting.

948
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,680
是的。
Yeah.

949
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,810
哦。欢呼。
Oh. Cheers.

950
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,930
好的。
Okay.

951
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,440
看起来它有一个襟翼。
Looks like it's got a flap.

952
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,100
它的襟翼松了。
It's got a loose flap.

953
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,460
-听着，只要…——嗯。
- Listen, just be... - Mm-hmm.

954
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,230
只是…只是要小心襟翼。
Just... Just be careful with the flap.

955
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,690
别再说"闪"了，好吗?
Please stop saying "flap," okay?

956
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:06,960
我完全没事。只是不要说拍打。
I'm totally fine. Just don't say flap.

957
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:13,200
-有多少?——嗯…两个在大厅。还有几个人和人质在泳池边。
- How many are there? - Uh... Two in the lobby. Couple more by the pool with the hostages.

958
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,280
还有一个在码头边，对吧?
And, uh, one by the dock, right?

959
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,680
但是我们有四个。
But we got four.

960
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,930
你说"得到"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "got"?

961
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:29,140
让他们不再活着了。
Got them to stop, you know, being alive.

962
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,550
天呐
Holy shit.

963
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,930
是啊，但我们没看到你的员工。
Well, yeah, we didn't see any of your staff, though.

964
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,260
我看到他们被锁在水疗中心。
I saw them getting locked up in the spa.

965
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,850
他们从来不为当地人操心。
They never bother with the locals.

966
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,180
美国人是富有的白痴。没有进攻。
Americans are the rich idiots. No offense.

967
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,100
我只是不明白为什么海盗还在这里。
I just don't understand why the pirates are still here.

968
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,940
上次，他们洗劫了房间。
Last time, they just looted the rooms.

969
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:49,160
二十分钟过去了。
Twenty minutes, gone.

970
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,660
你说"上次"是什么意思?
What do you mean, "last time"?

971
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:53,530
去年。
Last year.

972
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:56,820
菲律宾有2000个岛屿，他们却袭击了我们两次?
Two thousand islands in the Philippines, and they hit us twice?

973
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,340
-这不公平。-等等，等等。
- It's not fair. - Wait, wait.

974
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,620
去年夏天海盗来过这里?
The pirates were here last summer?

975
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,300
你居然让我们在这里举行婚礼?
And you let us have our wedding here?

976
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,850
什么?手鼓。我们谈过了吧?
What? Tom-Tom. We talked about it, huh?

977
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,390
你早就知道了?
You knew about this?

978
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,500
首先，去年夏天没人被杀。
Well, first of all, nobody got killed last summer.

979
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,880
我们都认为这种事情再次发生的可能性非常小。
And we both agreed that the chances of it happening again were very small.

980
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,820
-谁是"我们"?-我和玛吉。
- Who's "we"? - Me and Margy.

981
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,590
我们发了很多邮件，我问了很多尖锐的问题，不是吗?
We e-mailed a lot, and I asked a lot of tough questions, didn't I?

982
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:23,720
你怎么能不告诉我呢?
How could you not tell me about this?

983
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,580
你没告诉我你对结婚有疑虑，所以…是的，你说得对。我没有。你知道为什么吗?
You didn't tell me that you were having doubts about getting married, so... Yeah, you're right. I didn't. You know why?

984
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:33,780
因为去年一整年，你什么都在想。
Because all last year, you were in your head about everything.

985
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,660
你以为我爸不喜欢你，所以你开始表现得很奇怪。
You thought my dad didn't like you, so you started acting all weird.

986
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,130
现在我爸爸不喜欢你了。
And now my dad doesn't like you.

987
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,416
你以为罗宾斯家会抛弃你。
You thought the Robins were gonna drop you.

988
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,721
然后你开始打得很糟糕，他们就放弃了你。
And then you started playing badly, and they did drop you.

989
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,660
你以为会有坏事发生，然后你就让它发生了。
You think that something bad is gonna happen, and then you make it happen.

990
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,210
这叫做自我破坏。
That's called self-sabotage.

991
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,390
它是。艾斯，谢谢。
It is. Ace, thank you.

992
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,460
而你对这场婚礼感到兴奋。
And all you were excited about was this wedding.

993
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:58,720
我知道如果我告诉你我有疑虑，你就会破坏我们的关系。
And I knew that if I told you that I was having doubts, that you would sabotage our whole relationship.

994
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,340
你还是这么做了!
Which you did anyway!

995
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,030
我没有破坏任何东西。
I didn't sabotage anything.

996
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,180
我努力让这场婚礼完美无缺。
I tried to make this wedding perfect.

997
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,020
你儿子肖恩出现的那一天，一切都毁了。
And it all got ruined the day your boy Sean showed up.

998
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,810
这和肖恩没关系。
This has nothing to do with Sean.

999
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,650
这是因为你没有安全感。
This is about your insecurities.

1000
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:16,156
这场婚礼是你试图掌控自己生活的方式，因为你必须掌控一切。
And this whole wedding was your way of trying to get control of your life, because you have to control everything.

1001
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,630
这就像你下车来帮我平行停车，而我自己就能行。
It's like when you get out of the car to "help me" parallel park, when I can do it just fine on my own.

1002
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,496
是啊，我可不觉得17点的转弯"还好"
Yeah, I wouldn't call a 17-point turn "just fine."

1003
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,830
你上个月在Old Navy买的牛仔裤是女式牛仔裤。
Well, those jeans you bought from Old Navy last month were women's jeans.

1004
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,796
嗯…我在男装区找到的。
Uh... Well, I found them in the men's section.

1005
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,216
他们让你看起来像史蒂薇·尼克斯。
They made you look like Stevie Nicks.

1006
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,670
你去年的发型，我很讨厌。
That haircut that you got last year, I hated it.

1007
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,430
它让你的头看起来很方。你看起来就像辛普森家族的人。
It made your head look square. You looked like a fucking Simpson.

1008
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,920
你说它很时髦。
You said it was chic.

1009
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,800
你表现得那么自信，那么坚强，但你只是个害怕的小女孩。
You act so confident, so strong, but you're just a scared little girl.

1010
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,810
你害怕在这段关系中全力以赴，因为这意味着你可能会失去一些东西。
You're afraid to go all in on this relationship because it means you might have something to lose.

1011
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,040
你知道吗?反正这些都不重要。
Well, you know what? None of it matters anyway.

1012
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,340
因为我们爱的每个人都可能死去。
Because everyone we love could die.

1013
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,970
因为我。
Because of me.

1014
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,890
我想他们在经理家里。
I think they're in the manager's house.

1015
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,510
我想他们听到了。
I think they heard it.

1016
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:01,760
为什么?
Why?

1017
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,570
他们不再说英语了。
They stopped speaking English.

1018
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,740
在这里。把它。
Here. Take it.

1019
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,950
不喜欢。汤姆。
Don't. Tom.

1020
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,446
我们得离开这里。这条隧道通向哪里?
We need to get out of here. Where does this tunnel go?

1021
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:17,480
这条路直通其他海盗所在的水池。
It leads straight to the pool where the rest of the pirates are.

1022
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,170
哦，这不理想。
Oh, that's not ideal.

1023
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,760
他们在说什么?
What are they saying?

1024
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,450
没有线索。
No clue.

1025
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,010
我不知道那是什么语言，但肯定不是菲律宾语。
I don't know what language that is, but it ain't Filipino.

1026
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,140
——没有。——没有。
- No. - No.

1027
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,480
大家都别动。待在这里。
No one move. Stay right here.

1028
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,190
没有人动。
Nobody move.

1029
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,860
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1030
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,700
好的。
Okay.

1031
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,790
他们知道有人在这里，但不知道我们都在。
They know someone's here, but they don't know all of us are.

1032
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,960
你待在这里直到结束。
You stay here until it's over.

1033
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,290
汤姆!
Tom!

1034
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,700
汤姆!他们会杀了你的。
Tom! They're gonna kill you.

1035
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,470
-别这样。-我必须这么做。
- Don't do this. - I have to.

1036
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,060
这已经不是我们的事了。这是……整件事都是我的错。
This isn't about us anymore. This is... This whole thing is my fault.

1037
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,060
你应该得到更好的。
You deserve better.

1038
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,860
等一下,汤姆!
Wait, Tom!

1039
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:39,810
嗯…哦,嘿。
Uh... Oh, hey.

1040
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,190
嘿,海盗!
Hey, pirates!

1041
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:44,906
我是汤姆，你们一直在寻找的新郎，我正式投降。
I'm Tom, the groom you guys have been looking for, and I am officially surrendering.

1042
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:45,930
-闭嘴!-好吧。
- Shut up! - All right.

1043
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,416
怎么，你不喜欢被称为"海盗"吗?
What, you don't like to be called "pirates"?

1044
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,480
当我还是个孩子的时候，我想成为一名海盗，你们真的在做。
I wanted to be a pirate when I was a kid, and you guys are actually doin' it.

1045
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:51,970
——移动。-你活在梦里。
- Move. - You're livin' the dream.

1046
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,150
祝贺你。
Congratulations.

1047
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:56,330
他们没有杀他。我的天啊。
They didn't kill him. Oh, my God.

1048
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,680
他还活着。
He's still alive.

1049
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,770
走吧!
Go!

1050
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,730
继续。只是移动。
Keep going. Just move.

1051
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,260
汤米。我的天啊。这是汤米。汤米!
Tommy. Oh, my God. It's Tommy. Tommy!

1052
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,090
闭嘴!
Shut up!

1053
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,720
汤米，达西在哪儿?-闭嘴!
- Tommy, where is Darcy? - Shut up!

1054
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,680
是的。你的新娘呢?
Yes. Where is your bride?

1055
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,490
我…我不知道。
I... I don't know.

1056
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,690
真正的。诚实。我…我…我不喜欢。
Truly. Honestly. I... I... I don't.

1057
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,290
为实数。我不…我不…我不知道。
For reals. I don't... I don't... I don't know.

1058
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:24,730
你不会撒谎。
You're a bad liar.

1059
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,360
是的，他不太会撒谎。
Yeah, he is a bad liar.

1060
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,360
汤姆，如果你知道什么，你能做的就是合作。
Tom, if you know something, the best thing you can do is cooperate.

1061
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,090
他们只想要钱。
All they want is the money.

1062
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,540
你知道吗?谢谢你，肖恩，一如既往地，为我们讲道理。
You know what? Thank you, Sean, as always, for being the voice of reason.

1063
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,740
够了!
Enough!

1064
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,270
-好吧，好吧!——好的。
- Okay, fine! - Okay.

1065
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,640
我告诉你她在哪。
I'll tell you where she is.

1066
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,630
卡图卡卡奇。
Katuk kak ci.

1067
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:50,830
什么?
What?

1068
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:53,650
天呐你对他说了什么?
Holy shit. What did you say to him?

1069
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,160
这是个内部笑话，肖恩。
It's kind of an inside joke, Sean.

1070
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,776
你能帮我一下吗?我有点头晕。
Can you give me a hand? I'm a little woozy.

1071
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,390
“当然,人。来，我抓住你了。
'Course, man. Here, I got you.

1072
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,890
哇,哇!哇!
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

1073
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,230
你到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

1074
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,350
别动，否则我对天发誓，你会掉一只眼睛的。
Don't move or I swear to God, you'll lose an eye.

1075
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:06,530
汤米，你在做什么?
Tommy, what are you doing?

1076
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:08,366
是你说还是我说?
Are you gonna spill the beans or should I?

1077
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,390
什么豆?
What beans?

1078
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,820
说出来吧。
Just spill the beans.

1079
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:15,090
肖恩雇了这些人闯进我们的婚礼抢罗伯特的钱!
Sean hired these guys to invade our wedding to take Robert's money!

1080
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,200
哇。不，不，不，汤姆。
Whoa. No, no, no, no, Tom.

1081
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,400
不，这是真的。
No, it's true.

1082
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:24,670
这是一个很严重的指责，但没关系，因为嫉妒会让我们任何人都变得最好。
That is a serious accusation, but it's okay, 'cause jealousy can get the best of any of us.

1083
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:26,250
哦，不，不，不。我不是嫉妒。
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not jealous.

1084
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:27,670
种。
Kind of.

1085
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:33,800
你把我当成威胁是很正常的因为我和迪迪有过一段超然的感情。
It is completely normal for you to see me as a threat because Deedee and I had something transcendent.

1086
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,060
但我不是坏人。
But I am not a bad guy.

1087
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,446
而且我和这些海盗一点关系都没有。
And I definitely don't have anything to do with these pirates.

1088
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:42,310
噢,是吗?那我叫他去操他爷爷，他为什么要揍我?
Oh, yeah? Then why did he deck me when I told him to go fuck his grandpa?

1089
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,400
只是听。倾听自己的心声。
Just listen. Listen to yourself.

1090
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,650
我是用巴厘语说的。这些人不是本地人。
I said it in Balinese. These guys are not local.

1091
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,030
他们来自巴厘岛。
They're from Bali.

1092
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:51,110
玛姬说上次当地海盗抢劫后就走了。
Margy said the local pirates just looted and left last time.

1093
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,700
他们花了大概20分钟。
It took 'em, like, 20 minutes.

1094
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,200
哦,上帝。“最后一次”?
Oh, God. "Last time"?

1095
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,376
我们显然是被盯上了。这一切都是计划好的。
We were clearly targeted. This whole thing was planned.

1096
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,080
他们知道罗伯特的钱。
They knew about Robert's money.

1097
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,500
这一切都说不通，直到我发现了这个。
And none of it made sense until I found this.

1098
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,596
里奇，拿上我的…抓住………-是的，是的。-在我前面的口袋里。抓住……我前面口袋里有个信封。
Ricky, grab my... Grab the... the... - Yeah, yeah. - In my front pocket. Grab... There's an envelope in my front pocket.

1099
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,650
抓住它!
Just grab it!

1100
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,110
好了。
There you go.

1101
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,690
啊哈!
A-ha!

1102
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,300
慢,慢。走慢。
Slow, slow. Go slow.

1103
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,310
你的婚礼请柬?
Your wedding invitation?

1104
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:22,940
是的，但我是从其中一个人那里拿到的。
Yes, but I got it off of one of these guys.

1105
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,400
他们是怎么拿到邀请函的?
Now, how did they get that invitation?

1106
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,580
-我不知道。——嗯…它必须由一位受邀的客人送给他。
- I don't know. - Uh... It had to be given to him by an invited guest.

1107
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,420
那是什么受邀嘉宾呢?嗯?
Now, what invited guest could that be? Huh?

1108
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,420
瑞奇,op……打开它。
Ricky, op... open it.

1109
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,680
啊哈!
A-ha!

1110
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:46,540
这个混蛋认为参加一个他没有回复的婚礼是合适的!
This asshat thought it was appropriate to show up to a wedding he didn't RSVP to!

1111
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,710
他没有回复!
He didn't RSVP!

1112
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,710
妈妈，这不是现在的主要问题。
Mom, that's not the main issue right now.

1113
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:54,300
听着，我是个母亲。我可以同时为很多事情感到沮丧。
Look, I'm a mother. I can be upset about a lot of things at the same time.

1114
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,546
我觉得，现在，我们应该为一件事难过。
I think, right now, we should be upset about one thing.

1115
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:03,180
-好吧。-肖恩让这些人闯入我们的婚礼这样他就能从他最好的朋友罗伯特那里得到一大笔赎金。
- Oh, okay. - Sean had these guys crash our wedding so that he could get a big fat ransom from his best friend, Robert.

1116
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,060
嗯?是啊!
Huh? Yeah!

1117
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,150
——鲍勃……鲍勃。——是的!
- Bob... Bob. - Yes!

1118
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,530
这是因为我没有给你你想要的投资，对吧?
This is because I didn't give you that investment money you wanted, isn't it?

1119
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,130
-是的。-不，不，不是那样的
- Yeah. - No, no, it's not like that.

1120
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:16,740
怎么可能……爸爸。
How could... Papi.

1121
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,930
你怎么能相信我会来这里背叛…相信我，罗伯特。相信它。
How could you believe that I would come here and betray ev... Believe it, Robert. Believe it.

1122
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:23,930
-没错。这是正确的。——大便。
- That's right. That's right. - Shit.

1123
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,650
看到了吗?看，我告诉过你!我告诉过你!
See? See, I told ya! I told ya!

1124
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,530
这些灯笼很复杂。里面有纸条吗?
These lanterns are so intricate. Is there a note in it?

1125
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,730
“善待彼此。”
"Be excellent to each other."

1126
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,540
——嗯。——嗯。嗯。
- Hmm. - Hmm. Huh.

1127
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:01,510
这是比尔和泰德的精彩冒险。
It's from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1128
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:09,670
汤姆想在每个灯笼里放句电影台词，而我…我觉得这很蠢，但其实不是。
Tom wanted to put a movie quote in each one of the lanterns, and I... I thought it was stupid, but it's not.

1129
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,960
它是甜的。
It's sweet.

1130
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,960
我把一切都搞砸了。
And I messed it all up.

1131
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,090
我不知道你们是怎么做到的。
I don't know how you guys do it.

1132
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:19,280
你一定有什么特别的东西。
You must have something really special.

1133
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:22,260
-不太好。——Oi。
- Not really. - Oi.

1134
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,140
我是说，它很特别，但不是魔法。
Uh, I mean, it is special but it is not magic.

1135
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,310
我们刚发过誓。
We just made a vow.

1136
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:31,060
我们已经把事情搞砸了几千次了。
And we've messed things up thousands of times.

1137
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,170
但当我们破坏了一些东西，我们会修复它。
But when we break something, we fix it.

1138
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,060
达西，我们和你一起去，但我们不想去。
Darcy, we come with you, but we don't want to.

1139
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:01,680
汤米终于成功了。
Tommy finally made the big leagues.

1140
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,030
是啊，我从没听过这个。
Yeah, I never heard that one before.

1141
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,110
我知道你没有。
I know you haven't.

1142
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,270
-她在哪?-我不知道。
- Where is she? - I don't know.

1143
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:11,026
我不…我…我不…我不知道。
I don't... I... I don't... I don't know.

1144
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,420
-你在说谎。-不，我…我…说实话-我不知道。——好的。
- You're lying. - No, I'm... I'm... Honestly, - I don't know. - Okay.

1145
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,040
该死的!
God damn it!

1146
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:21,576
-你能不能别这样?-是的。
- Would you stop doing that? - Yeah.

1147
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,370
-他还会这么做的。——好。很好。
- He'll do it again. - Fine. Fine.

1148
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:25,570
我在撒谎。
I was lying.

1149
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,620
我们分手后，达西和我大吵了一架。
After we cut ourselves loose, Darcy and I got into a fight.

1150
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:38,100
她跳上一辆高尔夫球车，去北部海岸悬崖附近寻找手机信号，然后我…我回来是想救大家。
She hopped in a golf cart to go look for cell reception up by the northern coast near the cliffs, and then I... I came back here to try to rescue everyone.

1151
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,810
来吧!
Come on!

1152
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,140
好的。
Okay.

1153
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:48,220
我们坐直升机去找她。
We'll take the chopper to find her.

1154
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,730
我和你一起去。
I'm comin' with you.

1155
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,850
我一整天都看着你把事情搞砸了。
I've been watching you mess this up all day.

1156
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:53,600
这是我的节目了。
This is my show now.

1157
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,060
哇，太好了。
Wow, that's really good.

1158
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:56,960
我们现在要按我的方式来。明白了吗?
We're doing this my way now. You got it?

1159
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:58,960
我们需要抵押品。
We need collateral.

1160
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:10,510
找女朋友。
Get the girlfriend.

1161
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,830
嘿。来了。
Hey. Come.

1162
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:14,880
——在这里。动!——噢!嘿。
- Here. Move! - Ow! Hey.

1163
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,500
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1164
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,630
——走吧。动!-拜托，我是双子座。
- Go. Move! - Please, I'm a Gemini.

1165
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,480
我很容易受伤。
I bruise easily.

1166
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,720
——走吧!——噢!噢!噢!
- Go! - Ow! Ow! Ow!

1167
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,650
-我的天啊!——罗伯特?罗伯特!
- Oh, my God! - Robert? Robert!

1168
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,550
等我回来，那笔钱最好还在我的账户上。
When I get back, that money better be in my account.

1169
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,310
如果不是，她就死了。
And if it's not, she's dead.

1170
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,370
我把你当儿子看待。
And I treated you just like a son.

1171
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,890
-你现在被汤米缠住了- - - - - -罗伯特。
- You're stuck with Tommy now. - Robert.

1172
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:36,190
-那有什么不对吗?-滚开。
- Well, what's wrong with that? - Fuck off.

1173
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,400
不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1174
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:10,310
达西……汤姆，你答应过这个周末不离开我的。
Darcy... Tom, you promised you wouldn't leave my side this weekend.

1175
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:11,870
达西，你在干什么?
Darcy, what are you doing?

1176
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,450
汤姆,听。
Tom, listen.

1177
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:22,420
我还在生你选海盗岛的气，但我也搞砸了。我应该告诉你的……我有多害怕结婚
I'm still mad at you for picking this pirate island, but I messed up too. I should've told you... how scared I was to get married.

1178
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,440
这不公平。
That wasn't fair.

1179
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,536
你在海盗岛的婚礼上很努力。
You worked so hard on this pirate island wedding.

1180
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,450
好吧，不不不。请不要再这么叫了。
Okay, no, no, no. Please stop calling it that.

1181
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,880
我只是担心如果我告诉你
I just worried that if I told you...

1182
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,930
我会失去你
that I would lose you.

1183
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,600
我不能失去你。
And I can't lose you.

1184
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:44,440
我需要你。
I need you.

1185
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:49,740
好吗?
Okay?

1186
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,410
好吗?
Okay?

1187
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,350
好的。
Okay.

1188
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,020
——好的。——好的。
- Okay. - Okay.

1189
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,150
这比南太平洋好多了。
This is so much better than South Pacific.

1190
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,750
妈妈，爸爸呢?
And Mom, Dad?

1191
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,310
哇!
Whoa!

1192
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:05,390
——宝贝。-搞什么鬼?
- Babe. - What the fuck?

1193
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,520
你刚刚是开枪打我吗?
Did you just shoot me?

1194
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,610
别朝你妹妹开枪了!
Stop shooting your sister!

1195
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:11,090
我不是故意的。这是个错误。我…
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake. I...

1196
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,330
妈妈，爸爸，向汤姆道歉。
Mom, Dad, apologize to Tom.

1197
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:17,960
——什么?为什么?——什么?
- What? Why? - What?

1198
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,590
感谢你批评他策划的这场美丽的婚礼，感谢你从来没有让他觉得在我们家是受欢迎的。
For criticizing this beautiful wedding that he planned, and for never making him feel welcome in our family.

1199
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:25,670
谢谢你邀请肖恩参加我们的婚礼。
And for inviting Sean to our wedding.

1200
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:29,270
好吧，亲爱的，但我觉得有一个更紧迫的问题…——道歉!
Okay, honey, but I think there's - a more pressing issue... - Apologize!

1201
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,540
他是我认识的最好的人。
He is the best person that I know.

1202
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:36,990
如果你再说他一句坏话，我发誓我会像射杀杰米一样杀了你。
And if you say one more bad thing about him, I swear I will shoot you like I shot Jamie.

1203
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,700
汤姆，我很抱歉。对不起。
Tom, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1204
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,116
-汤姆，对不起。对不起。-我们爱你。
- Tom, sorry. Sorry. - We love you.

1205
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,616
-哦，嘿，没事-你是我见过最好的人-没关系。我爱你。
- Oh, hey, it's fine. - You're the best person - I've ever met. - It's okay. I love you.

1206
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,946
-我们像爱家人一样爱你。-我也爱你。
- We love you like family. - I love you, too.

1207
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,866
-好吧。一切都很好。-我爱这个地方。美丽。
- All right. It's all good. - I love this place. Beautiful.

1208
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,400
还有，卡罗尔，拉里……我很抱歉!我很抱歉!
And, Carol, Larry... I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1209
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,330
这主要是关于我和我的家人，但我们应该找个时间一起吃午饭。
This was more about me and my family, but we should get lunch sometime.

1210
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,086
-我会…-是啊-午餐听起来不错是的。-我们爱吃。
- I would... - Oh, yeah, - lunch sounds great. Yeah. - We love eating.

1211
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:58,350
任何人都很难辜负你完美的婚姻。
It's hard for anyone to live up to your perfect marriage.

1212
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,370
谁告诉你我们的婚姻很完美的?
Who told you we had a perfect marriage?

1213
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,710
哦，拜托，妈妈。你们打过一次架。
Oh, come on, Mom. You guys fought, like, once.

1214
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,266
而是谁更爱狗。
It was about who loved the dog more.

1215
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,350
我是说，你们的婚姻有什么不完美的?
I mean, what is not perfect about your marriage?

1216
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,930
我和你的玛丽阿姨做爱了。
Well, I made love to your Aunt Marie.

1217
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,260
什么?
What?

1218
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,810
-是的。-然后我出去和吉姆·罗伯茨做了一些奇怪的性行为。
- Yeah. - Then I went out and started doing all this weird sex stuff with Jim Roberts.

1219
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:19,020
是的。你和吉姆·罗伯茨交往了几个月。——是的。
Yeah. You and Jim Roberts - went on for a couple months. - Yes.

1220
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:24,400
-因为我们的身体刚好合适。-圣…最后，吉姆·罗伯茨不是你父亲。
- Because our bodies just fit. - Holy... In the end, Jim Roberts just wasn't your dad.

1221
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,790
玛丽阿姨意识到她有性瘾。
And Aunt Marie realized that she had a sex addiction.

1222
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,210
但你知道吗?我们解决了。
But then you know what? We worked it out.

1223
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,390
这些都是不可思议的突破，对吧?我的意思是……-给我!
These are some incredible breakthroughs, - right? I mean... - Give me that!

1224
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,750
你还记得我吗?
You remember me, huh?

1225
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,790
你把我的脸烫了。嗯?
Look, you burn my face. Huh?

1226
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,870
是的，我知道。我还是觉得很内疚。
Yes, I know. I still feel really bad about that.

1227
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,920
所有人，到泳池里去!现在!
Everybody, in the pool! Now!

1228
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:52,110
到泳池里去!!
Get in the pool! In!

1229
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,400
走吧!走吧!
Go! Go!

1230
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:59,140
-你还好吗?——是的。
- Hey, you okay? - Yes.

1231
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,950
——是吗?-我们失踪了吗?
- Yeah? - Are we missing people?

1232
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,910
是的。看来你儿子肖恩是个混蛋。
Yeah. Turns out your boy Sean's an asshole.

1233
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,790
我们找到新娘了。
We have the bride.

1234
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,540
听到了吗?
Do you copy?

1235
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,340
听到了吗?
Do you copy?

1236
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,240
起来!起来!
Up! Up!

1237
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,450
听我说。移动。
Listen to me. Move.

1238
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:23,420
巴厘人吗?这些人是巴厘人?
Balinese? So these guys are Balinese?

1239
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,330
肖恩满嘴胡言，他们还把哈里特扣为人质?
And Sean is full of shit, and they took Harriett hostage?

1240
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,530
这没有道理。
It doesn't make sense.

1241
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:31,760
为什么肖恩要把哈里特劫持在直升机上她已经被劫持在这里了?
Why would Sean take Harriett hostage on the helicopter when she was already being held hostage here?

1242
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:34,340
我不知道。也许他想多抓她做人质。
I don't know. Maybe he wanted to take her extra hostage.

1243
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:36,360
我觉得哈里特也有份。
I think Harriett is in on it.

1244
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:39,410
——什么?-什么意思?
- What? - What do you mean?

1245
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:49,190
哈里特和肖恩…是恋爱。
Harriett and Sean... are boyfriend-girlfriend.

1246
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:50,870
-哦，得了吧。——恋爱?
- Oh, come on. - Boyfriend-girlfriend?

1247
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,250
不,不。看。
No, no. Look.

1248
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,570
这是昨晚拍的。
This is from last night.

1249
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,570
开始吧。
Here we go.

1250
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,700
让我们来看看。
Let's see.

1251
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,680
等一下。让我找找看。
Uh, hold on. Let me find it.

1252
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,370
哦。哦,男孩。
Oh. Oh, boy.

1253
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,100
是的。好了。
Yeah. There you go.

1254
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:17,680
什么?去做吧。说出来。
What? Go ahead. Say it.

1255
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,900
罗伯特……
Roberto...

1256
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,530
Lo siento。
Lo siento.

1257
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,290
谢谢。
Gracias.

1258
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,920
没有什么结果。
De nada.

1259
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,050
在那里!
There!

1260
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,410
肖恩，你保证过这份工作会让我们发财的。
Sean, you promised this job would make us rich.

1261
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,710
到目前为止，它只杀了我的四个人。
So far, all it's done is killed four of my men.

1262
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,210
伙计，你知道我们能解决的。
Man, you know we can fix this.

1263
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:51,880
交易取消了。我留着钱。
Deal is off. I keep the money.

1264
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,090
你就这样离开了。
You walk away with your life.

1265
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,720
我不想听。你和我有过约定。
I don't wanna hear it. You and I had an arrangement.

1266
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,180
肖恩，理智点。他救了我们。
Sean, be reasonable. He saved us.

1267
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,316
-我们很幸运能活着。-你在说什么?
- We're lucky to be alive. - What are you talking about?

1268
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,470
听你女人的话。
Listen to your woman.

1269
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,980
哦。
Oh.

1270
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,740
没关系。这只是一个压力点。放松。
It's okay. It's just a pressure point. Relax.

1271
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,000
对着它呼吸。
Just breathe into it.

1272
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,870
什么?
What?

1273
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,580
什么?
What?

1274
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,440
带我们下去。
Take us back down.

1275
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,740
我们将自己完成这项工作。
We'll finish the job ourselves.

1276
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:20,420
——宝贝。——什么?
- Babe. - What?

1277
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,830
-好主意。-是的，我知道。
- Excellent idea. - Yeah, I know.

1278
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:26,510
我什么事都得自己做!
I have to do everything myself!

1279
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,460
我们该怎么办?他们随时都会回来。
What are we gonna do? They'll be back any minute.

1280
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:33,520
,就…-嘿，嘿，嘿!
- Just... - Hey, hey, hey!

1281
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,860
没有低语。或者我往泳池里扔手榴弹。
No whispers. Or I throw grenade in the pool.

1282
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:43,950
好的。
Okay.

1283
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,930
跟我走，好吗?
Go with me, okay?

1284
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,280
跟我去吧。
Just go with me.

1285
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,330
嘿,每一个人。
Hey, everybody.

1286
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:57,210
我知道现在可能不是最好的时机，但这可能是我们举行婚礼的唯一机会。
Look, I know this may not be the best time, but this may be our only chance to have our wedding.

1287
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,210
你说呢，达西?
What do you say, Darcy?

1288
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,870
是的,我……我很喜欢。
Yeah, I... I love it.

1289
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:06,470
可以…我们可以做新娘在左边新郎在右边吗?
Can... Can we do bride's side on the left and groom's on the right?

1290
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,060
嘿，玛姬，你来主持好吗?
Hey, Margy, will you officiate?

1291
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:16,250
嘿，你能别说了吗?停止它!现在就住手!
Hey, will you stop? Stop it! Stop it now!

1292
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:21,190
等待,等待。如果……如果你让我女儿结婚，我会…我会释放资金。
Wait, wait. If... If you let my daughter have her wedding, I'll... I'll release the funds.

1293
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,580
好吧，走吧。
Okay, let's go.

1294
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,040
我们走吧。
Let's go.

1295
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,040
谢谢,爸爸。
Thanks, Dad.

1296
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,650
没事的，小公主。
It's okay, princess.

1297
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,090
有些东西比钱更重要。
There are some things that are more important than money.

1298
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,970
我不知道是什么，但我想，呃…
I don't know what they are, but I think, uh...

1299
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,650
希望你知道自己在做什么。
Hope you know what you're doing.

1300
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,610
♬你眼睛里的泪丝
♪ The strands in your eyes ♪

1301
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:20,530

- Yeah, let's go. - Margy! The spa!

1344
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,560

谢谢你，宝贝。
Thank you, baby.

Mom! Mom, we're gonna go get help.

1349

Deedee, this is a huge misunderstanding, all right?

1389
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,710
我们回度假村去，好好谈谈。我不想伤害你。
Let's go back to the resort, talk this over. I do not want to hurt you.

1390
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,330

Asshole! Fuckin' leave! What the fuck?

1396
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,530
天啊，我真不敢相信你，肖恩!你什么时候变成这样的怪物了?
God, I can't believe you, Sean! When did you turn into such a monster?

1397
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,560

-是的。-我不想这么做。
- Yeah. - I don't wanna do this.

我是个好人，该死!
I'm a good guy, damn it!

1404
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,380
大便。
Shit.

1405
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:26,330
你的船死了。
Your boat's dead.

1406
01:26:26,530 --> 01:26:29,870
我们都没子弹了。我们回去把这整件事都解决了。
We're both out of ammo. Let's just go back and we can work this whole thing out.

1407
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:40,930
汤姆!
Tom!

1408
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,530
走,走!
Go, go!

1409
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,320
达西，马上调头。
Darcy, turn this boat around right now.

1410
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,740
不。
No.

1411
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:31,060
你是个混蛋，肖恩，但我知道你杀不了我。
You're a piece of shit, Sean, but I know you can't kill me.

1412
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:32,260
你是对的。
You're right.

1413
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,620
但我很想杀了这家伙。
But I would love to kill this guy.

1414
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,770
你总是把事情搞砸，伙计。这是你的责任。
You just keep messing things up, man. This is on you.

1415
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,880
我不想这么做。我是个好人。
I don't wanna do this. I'm a good guy.

1416
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,300
不，你不是。
No, you're not.

1417
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:46,170
好吧，你说得对。我不是。
All right, you're right. I'm not.

1418
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,150
肖恩!
Sean!

1419
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,970
你真可惜!
You were a pity invite!

1420
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11,390
狗屎!
Shit!

1421
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:13,280
哇!哇!
Whoa! Whoa!

1422
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,320
不!他妈的!
No! Fuck!

1423
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:48,510
那是一团散乱的头发吗?
Is that a wad of loose hair?

1424
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:50,100
定制的头发!
Custom-made hair!

1425
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,190
下来!
Get down!

1426
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,390
哦,弗里克。
Oh, frick.

1427
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:24,860
等一等。
Hold on.

1428
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,530
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1429
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:48,800
天呐
Holy shit.

1430
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,500
所以我之前问你我们能不能重新开始
So when I asked you before if we could start over...

1431
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,880
我不想重新开始。
I don't wanna start over.

1432
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,810
我想继续前进。
