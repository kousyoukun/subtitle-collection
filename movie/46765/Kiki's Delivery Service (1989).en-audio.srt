3
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,914
But, first, here's the weather forecast.

4
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,374
Skies are clearing up,

5
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,335
thanks to a high-pressure front
moving in from the mountains.

6
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:10,671
Mild winds will be
blowing in from the west,

7
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:13,299
pushing the clouds out by this evening.

8
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:16,385
There'll be a beautiful full moon
lighting up the sky,

9
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,637
so if you have been planning
something special,

10
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,765
tonight might be the night.

11
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,851
Tomorrow also looks good
with clear skies and sun.

12
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,716
Jiji, wake up. Tonight's the night.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,969
Hey, Mom.

14
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:03,349
Hi, Miss Dora.
Hey, Mom, it's gonna be clear tonight.

15
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:06,560
And guess what?
The radio says there'll be a full moon.

16
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,980
Did you borrow your father's radio
again without asking?

17
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,399
Don't worry. He doesn't mind.

18
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:13,901
Please excuse me, Miss Dora.

19
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:16,612
Mom, it's a perfect midnight
for me to leave home.

20
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,532
You mean tonight?
Next month is what you told me.

21
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:21,992
Yeah. But the next full moon
might be on a cloudy night.

22
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,161
And I want to leave
on the perfect midnight.

23
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,121
Huh? But, Kiki... Wait.

24
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:33,754
My, oh, my. What's this all about?

25
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,424
It's one of our oldest customs
that when a witch turns 13,

26
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,511
she has to leave home for a year
to begin her training.

27
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,180
Your little baby is 13?

28
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:46,016
My goodness, but time flies so quickly.

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,812
I know. She seems so young
to be leaving home now.

30
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:55,025
I remember very well
the exact day you arrived in this town.

31
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,321
A little girl flew down from the sky
on her broomstick.

32
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,492
And I was certain she was much
too young to hold such an important job

33
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,160
as resident witch.

34
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:09,707
Yes, but I could fly.
Kiki barely knows how to do that.

35
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,127
And I have had no time
to teach her how to mix potions like me.

36
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,007
Hmm. Young people are all the same.
They all want to do something different.

37
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,927
But I hope you at least get to teach her
the potion that cures my rheumatism.

38
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:27,975
Hurry up! We always said we'd leave
on the perfect night. Didn't we?

39
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:31,145
Uh-uh. Our plan was that we would
stick around for another month

40
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,063
and play it safe. I like that plan.

41
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:36,609
And if we put it off for a month,
and I find some wonderful boyfriend,

42
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,277
then what'll we do?

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,653
Come on, Jiji.

44
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:42,823
I'm gonna put my paws together
and pray you're not serious.

45
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:44,617
Of course I am.

46
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:49,872
You know, ever since I turned 13,
I've been excited about making this trip.

47
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:53,626
There. Dad.

48
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,920
Dad. Guess what?

49
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,839
I've decided to leave tonight.

50
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:01,425
- You're going away?
- Yeah. There's a full moon.

51
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,802
Well, yeah, but what happened
to the camping trip

52
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,429
we were supposed to take
this weekend?

53
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,181
Sorry, Dad.

54
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,727
Uh! Kiki, Wait.

55
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:20,611
Yeah, I'll expect you then. Thanks.

56
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:28,327
Hi, Mom, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you knew that Kiki is leaving tonight.

57
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,495
Yes, midnight.

58
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,168
Very pretty.

59
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,420
Lilac would look prettier on me,
or white.

60
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,423
Witches have worn this color
for a very long time, Kiki.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,344
Oh, Mom. I look really dumb.

62
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:48,138
It's not really important
what color your dress is.

63
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,307
What matters is the heart inside.

64
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, I'm gonna be
the very best witch that I can be, Mom.

65
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:56,188
And I know having a good heart
is important.

66
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,565
Just follow your heart and keep smiling.

67
00:04:58,649 --> 00:04:59,733
Yeah.

68
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,071
And be sure to write home
as soon as you're settled.

69
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:05,239
Okay.

70
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,200
Dad. Oh, can I please take the radio?

71
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,703
Mom, didn't you say
I could have the radio?

72
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:11,870
Yay!

73
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:14,248
- All right. It's yours already.
- Thank you.

74
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:19,545
Well, now, you certainly look
very grown-up, my little princess.

75
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,923
Ta-da!

76
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,094
You look just like your mother
when she was young.

77
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,179
I'm glad about that.

78
00:05:29,388 --> 00:05:31,890
Dad, can you lift me up high,
like when I was little?

79
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,308
Well...

80
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,814
I don't know.

81
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:40,691
Here we go!

82
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,366
How come you never told me
you were growing up so fast?

83
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:52,119
If things don't work out,
you can always come home.

84
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:53,746
And come back a failure?

85
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,169
Will you write us
if you have the time?

86
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,129
Mmm-hmm.

87
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,428
After all, she is a baby.

88
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,309
Aren't you worried about Kiki
living in a big city all alone?

89
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:17,102
Of course, they are.
But Kiki will be just fine.

90
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:20,064
- You're gonna find a city by the ocean?
- Or maybe a town?

91
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,566
Uh-huh. That's what I'm hoping anyway.

92
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,234
Wow! You're gonna have
such a good time.

93
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:25,903
I'm so jealous. You'll have so much fun.

94
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,238
But I'm not going just for a good time.

95
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,742
In order to be a good witch,
I have to train a year away from home.

96
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,244
Yeah. Be sure to tell that to the boys.

97
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,624
Kiki, it's time.

98
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:39,833
Okay.

99
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,420
That's the broom
you're going to be leaving on?

100
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,423
Yup. I just made it this morning
all by myself.

101
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,425
Honey, it's too small to be really safe.

102
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,677
I'd rather you took my broom.
I know it better.

103
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:54,973
- But, Mom, that one's so old.
- And that's why it's good.

104
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:58,435
You can rely on it time after time
in any kind of weather.

105
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,729
Now, Kiki, do this for me, please.

106
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,774
But I put so much work into this one.
Right, Jiji?

107
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,319
Your broom is nice,
but let's take your mother's.

108
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:08,403
You're no help.

109
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,239
Now, Kiki,

110
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:14,576
can't you make yourself another
fine broom when you get settled down?

111
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,662
Mmm-hmm.

112
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,959
Be careful.

113
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,836
- You be strong. Okay?
- I will.

114
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,880
Bye, Kiki.

115
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,758
- Fly safely.
- Go get 'em!

116
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,931
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki.

117
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:39,726
Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go, Kiki. Go!

118
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,612
Aim your broomstick.

119
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,874
May our little baby be well
and have a safe trip.

120
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,877
I'm going to miss
the wonderful sound of those bells.

121
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,461
Mmm-hmm.

122
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:16,138
- Where are we going?
- I'm headed south to see the ocean.

123
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:23,061
Jiji, climb up and turn on the radio.

124
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:26,106
I don't think I can handle it.
Can you do it?

125
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,032
Hey. Good evening.

126
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,743
It was.

127
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:03,954
You're new, aren't you?

128
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,456
Yup! How'd you guess?
I just left home tonight.

129
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,793
Mmm-hmm. Would you mind
turning off that radio?

130
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:13,922
- I prefer to fly without being distracted.
- Oh. Yeah, sure.

131
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,554
Could you tell me? Is it really hard
to get settled into a brand new city?

132
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,056
Oh, yes. A lot can go wrong.

133
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,476
But since my skill is fortune-telling,
I can handle anything.

134
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,230
- Fortune-telling?
- Yes. I tell fortunes about love.

135
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,648
Wow!

136
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,817
And what exactly is your skill?

137
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:37,446
Um. Well, I haven't really decided
that yet.

138
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,782
Ah. Well, I'm nearly finished
with my training period.

139
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:43,618
I'm going home soon
to show off my new skills.

140
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:46,872
- That's my town down there.
- It's so big!

141
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:50,334
Yes, to you I'm sure it looks big.

142
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,420
- I hope you don't have too tough a time.
- Thanks.

143
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,631
Ciao!

144
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,846
Jeez, what a snob.
And did you see that cat?

145
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:05,932
What's my skill?

146
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,273
What are we gonna do?
We can't stay up!

147
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,785
Hold on!

148
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,132
We better rest here until it's dry.

149
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:42,469
- Won't we get in trouble?
- Not if nobody finds us.

150
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,394
I'm soaked through down to the bone.

151
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,104
Hello?

152
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,651
Mmm. This smells great.

153
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,730
Oops! Sorry. We didn't mean
to fall asleep in your breakfast.

154
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:27,282
Wow!

155
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:31,661
Jiji, you've gotta come see the ocean.
It's beautiful.

156
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:35,540
Big deal. It's just a big puddle of water.

157
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:36,833
Look. Up ahead.

158
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,552
How lovely.

159
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:51,765
- I wonder if they have a witch there.
- Oh, great.

160
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:06,571
Ready, set, go!

161
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,365
Hold on.

162
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:18,458
You okay back there?

163
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:20,752
Wow!

164
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,464
This is just the kind of place
I've always imagined.

165
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,366
Wow! A clock tower.

166
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,078
Look at this city. A place like this
would be great to live in.

167
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,914
But there may be some witches
living here already.

168
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,374
And there may not be.

169
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,080
Look at how many people there are.

170
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,249
Too many, if you ask me.

171
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:44,878
Bless my hourglass.
It's a real, live witch.

172
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,880
Good morning.

173
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:51,134
- Do any witches live in this town?
- Why...

174
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,637
Nobody's seen one around here
in a long time.

175
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,015
That's great. Our trip is over.
We're staying right here.

176
00:15:57,098 --> 00:16:00,018
- Thanks, mister. Bye.
- No problem.

177
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:08,151
- Tell me we're not landing down there.
- Well, of course, we are.

178
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,374
- They're looking at us.
- I know.

179
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:24,709
Smile, so we make a good impression.

180
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:08,086
Um. Hi. My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.

181
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,755
And this is Jiji. He's my black cat.

182
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,675
And we'd be honored
if we could live here.

183
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:19,973
Your city is so amazing.
And what a beautiful clock tower.

184
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:24,978
Really. That's very nice, dear. Bye.

185
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,021
Uh...

186
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,487
Hey, you, kid.

187
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:37,031
Who do you think you are,
jumping out into the street like that?

188
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:39,367
You were almost responsible
for a big accident,

189
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,161
zooming around on your broom
back there.

190
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:44,581
But I'm a new witch, sir.
We're supposed to fly around.

191
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,500
You're supposed to obey the law.
I'm gonna have to write you up.

192
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,210
Now give me your name and address.

193
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,045
Will you tell my parents?

194
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,465
Of course, I'm going to tell your parents.

195
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:56,342
- I have to do that with every minor.
- Thief! Thief!

196
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:58,094
- Huh?
- Somebody call the cops.

197
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,347
- He's getting away!
- Now you stay right there.

198
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,538
Uh, Kiki?

199
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,544
Miss. Wait up.
I sure fooled that cop, huh?

200
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,172
Hey, that was me yelling "thief."

201
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,925
You'll be okay now.
Worked out pretty good, huh?

202
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,844
You gotta be a real witch,
the way you can fly that broom.

203
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:41,971
Do you think maybe
you can teach me how to fly it?

204
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,640
Hey, Tombo.

205
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,476
Maybe you can sweep her
off her feet with that broom.

206
00:18:46,851 --> 00:18:48,812
Hey, shut up, all right?

207
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:56,653
You know, miss, I love flying, too.
Can I see your broom? Hey, wait!

208
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,279
Thank you for getting me out of trouble.

209
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,740
But I really shouldn't be talking to you,
and you wanna know why?

210
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,325
It's very rude to talk to a girl

211
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,578
before you've been introduced
and before you know her name. Hmph!

212
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,039
Uh...

213
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,168
Hmm.

214
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,215
You're kind of old-fashioned,
aren't you?

215
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,718
- You sound like my grandmother.
- Just go away and leave me alone!

216
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:22,846
Hey! Don't go.

217
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:32,438
Hmm. What a cool witch.

218
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,195
Stay here tonight?
I'm afraid I don't understand.

219
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,905
Your parents are here with you,
aren't they?

220
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:42,574
No, sir, I'm alone.

221
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:45,785
I've come to this town
because I'm a new witch in training.

222
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,453
Do you have some identification?

223
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,789
Oh, never mind.

224
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,932
- Kiki, aren't you going to eat that?
- No, you can have it, Jiji.

225
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,812
Where are we going to stay tonight?

226
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,822
Let's go.

227
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:03,029
Why don't we go find another town?

228
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:04,739
I'll bet there are bigger and better ones.

229
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:07,367
Ones that are friendlier than this.

230
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,705
Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness.

231
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:17,335
Hey, there! Your pacifier!

232
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:20,880
Ma'am, you forgot your baby's pacifier.

233
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,092
Oh, poor baby.

234
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:29,180
Without this, the baby'll wake up
and cry all the way home.

235
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,975
I better go give it to her myself.

236
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:37,730
I'm sorry, folks. But could you wait
just a minute? I'll be right back.

237
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:44,821
Excuse me. But would you like me
to deliver it for you?

238
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:45,905
What?

239
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,783
The woman with the baby carriage
who just went around the corner.

240
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:52,161
- I could reach her in no time.
- Really? You'd do that?

241
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,747
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

242
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:56,374
Let's go, Jiji.

243
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,177
Wow!

244
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:21,607
Sorry to surprise you, but the lady in the
bakery asked me to return this pacifier.

245
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:41,044
- Here you go.
- Okay, I'd like one of those.

246
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,297
Yes, sir. Oh, hi, there.
Come in and wait a minute, will you?

247
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,302
Mmm. These are nice
and fresh. Just out of the oven.

248
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,763
There you are.

249
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,516
Here you go. See you tomorrow. Bye.

250
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,312
And that'll be all for you?
All right. Thank you.

251
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,316
Now, come back again.

252
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:11,741
When I saw you fly off,
I thought for a second I was dreaming.

253
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,993
The baby's mother told me
to give you this message.

254
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:15,203
Hmm?

255
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,832
"Thanks for returning the pacifier.

256
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:23,086
"Your new delivery girl
is really quite special."

257
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:27,256
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

258
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,842
I really must do something
to show you my thanks.

259
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:39,519
Follow me. Bakery is downstairs.
Upstairs is home.

260
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,233
Sit down and relax.
Would you like some hot chocolate?

261
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,400
Okay.

262
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:00,915
- There you go.
- Thank you very much, ma'am.

263
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,417
And, this is for you, little guy.

264
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,381
So tell me if I'm right.
I'm guessing you're a witch in training.

265
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:13,719
I really love it here. But people
don't seem to like witches in this town.

266
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,513
Depends on the people.

267
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:19,600
Now, take me, for instance.
I just met you and I know I like you.

268
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,272
So, tell me,
whereabouts are you two staying?

269
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:27,358
- Uh...
- Oh, I see.

270
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:31,237
Why didn't you tell me
you have no place to stay?

271
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,990
We have a spare room in the attic.
You can use that.

272
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:35,491
You'd really let me stay with you?

273
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:40,788
Why, of course.
But we haven't introduced ourselves.

274
00:24:40,872 --> 00:24:44,083
- My name's Osono.
- And I'm Kiki, ma'am.

275
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,169
And Jiji here is my very best friend.

276
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,172
It's right up here, Kiki.

277
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:52,049
It may need a little dusting,
but I think you'll like it.

278
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,349
Oh, my! It's a little bit dustier
than I remember.

279
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,186
If I weren't about to have a baby,
I'd help you clean.

280
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,729
- That's okay.
- All right, then.

281
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:07,565
Water and bathroom are downstairs.
Give a shout if you need anything.

282
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:08,983
Thank you.

283
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,866
- This is quaint.
- Jiji.

284
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:31,589
Hmph! If you wake up tomorrow
and find a white cat, it's me.

285
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,471
Jiji, we can see the ocean from here.

286
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:47,146
Can we look for a new town?

287
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,286
Pardon me, Miss Snooty Cat.

288
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:12,129
And the excitement is building

289
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:15,841
for the moment when the big blimp
appears in our skies.

290
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:19,929
And so we're gonna go to Scott,
live, as he reports in from...

291
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,390
Jiji, I've decided not to leave this town.

292
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:25,518
Maybe I can stay and find
some other nice people like Osono

293
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,271
who will like me
and accept me for who I am.

294
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:30,022
...and the ship making
some kind of landing

295
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:31,649
just so that everyone
can get a closer look.

296
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,048
And the amazing thing is

297
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,635
there's never been a dirigible this large
and this safe before.

298
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:24,512
How much do you think it would cost
to get a phone here?

299
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,432
- A phone?
- Yup. We're gonna need a phone.

300
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,748
- Morning, everyone.
- Well, look who's up.

301
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,334
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes. Oh, that smells good.

302
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,461
- Can I help out?
- Sure can.

303
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,484
Ooh, a delivery business, huh?

304
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:23,237
Well, I really only have one skill,
and that's flying.

305
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,240
So I thought a delivery service
wouldn't be a bad idea.

306
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:29,702
It's a great idea.
Kiki's Flying Delivery Service.

307
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:33,289
And since you're staying right here,
I can be your very first account.

308
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,333
You mean it? Oh, that's great.

309
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,295
I was planning
on putting a phone upstairs.

310
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:42,631
- But a phone is so expensive.
- I have a little saved up already.

311
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:44,133
Don't waste your money.

312
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,386
What I think you should do
is use our phone.

313
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:50,139
You know, it will take some time
to get regular customers.

314
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,558
I'll make you a deal.
Since I'm expecting a baby,

315
00:29:52,683 --> 00:29:53,767
I could use help.

316
00:29:53,851 --> 00:29:55,644
If you mind the store once in a while,

317
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,146
I'll let you have the room and the phone.

318
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,482
And I'll throw in a free breakfast, okay?

319
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,734
Yeah! We've got a deal.

320
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:03,986
I'm gonna work very hard for you.

321
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,907
Osono, you're the greatest.

322
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:20,252
Hmm?

323
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:41,607
Jiji, come on. I'm all through.

324
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,278
We're gonna go shopping. Come on.

325
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,797
Kiki, in the city,
you can't just run out into the street.

326
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,550
I'm sorry. We're still alive, aren't we?

327
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,385
You know how boys are.

328
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:14,557
He's so cute. I hope
he's still invited to her birthday party.

329
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,850
- Don't you?
- Yeah.

330
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:27,152
I wish I had something pretty to wear.
My dress is so ugly.

331
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,497
Wow! This costs so much.

332
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:40,833
Kiki, look. It's me.

333
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:55,681
Any money left, Kiki?

334
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,852
Not much. Looks like all we can
afford to eat now is pancakes.

335
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,449
Look, Jiji. Aren't they beautiful?

336
00:32:21,457 --> 00:32:22,541
Hey. Pull over.

337
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,338
Hey, there.
Miss Witch, do you remember me?

338
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,673
How come you're not flying today?

339
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,051
It's me, you remember? Tombo.

340
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:36,889
You can tell she's a witch
'cause she always wears a dark dress.

341
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:40,059
Hey, wait. Come back, please.
I didn't mean to insult you.

342
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:42,770
- Yeah.
- Better luck next time, Tombo.

343
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:54,698
Oh, Kiki, perfect timing.

344
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:57,242
There's a lady here
who wants you to make a delivery.

345
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,704
- She's your first customer.
- Customer? Oh, my! I'll be right back.

346
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,766
Dear, this lady is a customer of ours,

347
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,185
and we were talking
about your new delivery service.

348
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:26,313
- What a charming girl.
- My name's Kiki, ma'am.

349
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,649
Osono's told me great things about you.

350
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:30,609
Do you think you can deliver this
by tonight?

351
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,403
Yeah. I can.

352
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:34,655
It's a birthday gift for my nephew.

353
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,283
But something came up at work,
and I can't make it to the party on time.

354
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,661
I can get it there for you,
guaranteed.

355
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,329
Show me on the map
where you want it delivered.

356
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:44,623
Huh? But that's me.

357
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,501
Are you sure it won't be too far?

358
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:50,713
- I can fly there straight from here.
- Great. How much will it cost?

359
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:53,632
Oh! Well, I haven't really thought
about a price.

360
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:55,926
Aha! How about this much then?

361
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,346
I hope it'll be enough.
What do you think?

362
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:03,225
This much for me?
That's great. Thank you.

363
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,658
Yeah. I got to see this.

364
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,670
- She's the most amazing girl.
- She sure is.

365
00:34:31,754 --> 00:34:34,173
Hey, what can you tell me about her?

366
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:55,068
Kiki, how high do you intend to go?

367
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:59,698
This is my first job, and I do not want
to be stopped by that traffic cop.

368
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,661
Well, don't look now,
but that's an airplane flying under us.

369
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,211
Now, let's see.
Yup. It's just past the cape.

370
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,341
- Here we go.
- Whoa, boy.

371
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,683
I'm getting to like this town
more and more.

372
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:28,560
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

373
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:32,356
I can't wait to write Mom and Dad
about my new business.

374
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:53,043
Look who's behind us. Wild geese.

375
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:57,381
And they're coming with us.

376
00:36:10,352 --> 00:36:12,479
Hi.

377
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:26,201
- They seem awfully upset.
- They say they're going to fly higher.

378
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,161
- Huh?
- They say a gust of wind's coming.

379
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:29,246
Oh.

380
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,157
Oh! A nest!

381
00:37:06,408 --> 00:37:07,743
Oh, I'm sorry.

382
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,163
Leave me alone.

383
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:16,168
I wasn't trying to steal your eggs. Really.

384
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,888
Oh, my goodness.

385
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:31,099
Well, it's your fault. The geese were
kind enough to warn us of that wind.

386
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:33,018
- But would you listen?
- Oh, be quiet.

387
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:38,106
Look at them. Up so high.

388
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,734
That gust of wind
took them all the way up.

389
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:43,946
Kiki, we've got a problem.
The toy fell out.

390
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:46,323
We've gotta go back.

391
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:01,046
They're calling you an egg stealer.

392
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:05,050
If I were you,
I wouldn't go back down there, again.

393
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,677
We have to. Hold on!

394
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,988
Hey. Stop that. Go away.

395
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,116
Leave us alone. Stop it.

396
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:45,924
- Maybe we better rethink our plan.
- Frankly, I think this is a major insult.

397
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:48,844
Crows used to serve witches
and do what you told them.

398
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,263
That was a long time ago, okay?

399
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:55,851
How about if we go in after dark?
Go in. Get it. Get out.

400
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,645
We won't be able to make it in time.

401
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:00,939
Unless we buy ourselves some time.

402
00:39:01,189 --> 00:39:02,858
You gotta be kidding.

403
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:06,278
You can just pretend to be the doll
until I find the real one.

404
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,534
Don't worry. Hold still.

405
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:15,037
- Can I breathe?
- No, no breathing.

406
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,845
It must be my present from aunty.

407
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:33,972
Yeah. Give it to me.

408
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,603
This is dumb.

409
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:46,526
You're a bit late.

410
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,362
After my sister telephoned,
we were wondering where you were.

411
00:39:49,446 --> 00:39:50,989
Uh, I'm sorry.

412
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:53,617
Um...

413
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:56,828
Could I please
have your signature, ma'am?

414
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,665
Mom, can I put the canary in here?

415
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:04,002
Uh-huh. But you be sure
not to let it fly away, Ket.

416
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:05,170
Okay.

417
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:10,634
I've gotta run. Bye!

418
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,472
Thank you. Enjoy your present.

419
00:40:20,894 --> 00:40:22,979
Come on, you stupid bird.

420
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:26,858
I got a brand-new home for you.

421
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:32,781
Please hurry, Kiki.

422
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:06,857
I know you fell close by,
so you've got to be here somewhere.

423
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,746
There you are.

424
00:41:26,626 --> 00:41:28,420
Hello. Anyone home?

425
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:31,131
Is anybody here? Anybody? Hello.

426
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,224
- Anybody here?
- Yes.

427
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:44,102
Stop shouting. I'm on the roof.
What do you want?

428
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:47,355
Why don't you come up?

429
00:41:58,867 --> 00:41:59,868
What do you want?

430
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:03,538
Oh, well, you have a black cat
in your cabin window,

431
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,624
and, you see,
it's mine and I need it back.

432
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:10,295
You're a good birdie, aren't you?

433
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:14,382
So, why was it alone in the forest, huh?

434
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:18,053
That's where I dropped it.
Um. May I have it back, please?

435
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,139
I really need to finish this.

436
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:23,642
That's my girl.

437
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,895
You're just about through, okay?

438
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,823
Well, why didn't you tell me sooner
why you needed it in such a hurry?

439
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,411
He keeps me company. I've gotten
sort of fond of him, you know?

440
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:44,537
Thank you.

441
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,123
Oh! Oh, no!

442
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,834
His head's falling off.

443
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:52,921
Ooh, it must have been the crows. They
were making such a big fuss over him.

444
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,507
This is terrible. I can't
deliver it like this.

445
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,133
Hmm.

446
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,804
Hey! I know.
How about we work out a deal?

447
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:06,893
So you're on your own at 13.
That's pretty exciting.

448
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:10,188
To be completely independent
and a witch. Impressive.

449
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:13,441
- How's it going?
- Trust me. He'll be good as new.

450
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,361
Almost done.

451
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:21,533
Ket, dear. Turn Off the TV.

452
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:26,288
Your birthday guests
are gonna be here soon.

453
00:43:28,081 --> 00:43:29,541
Ket. Did you hear me?

454
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:34,045
- Ket, turn off the TV!
- Okay, okay.

455
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,356
- I'm done.
- Thank you very much.

456
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:37,984
- Better go get Jiji before it's too late.
- But I haven't finished yet.

457
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:41,071
Don't worry. You've done enough.
Now, go on and get him.

458
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:42,364
Thanks.

459
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:54,793
Jeff likes my present more than me.

460
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:57,420
Jeff's such a funny dog.

461
00:44:57,504 --> 00:45:00,382
He simply adores that stuffed cat.
He won't leave it alone.

462
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:01,925
I'll bet he thinks it's a puppy.

463
00:45:02,008 --> 00:45:05,220
He'll be upset when Ket
wants to take it and play with it.

464
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:07,263
- He sure will. He sure will.
- That's okay.

465
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:09,724
Just don't forget to
send your aunt a thank-you note.

466
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,352
- Okay. Okay.
- Ket.

467
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:15,730
Well, I'm glad to see Jeff
excited about something.

468
00:45:15,814 --> 00:45:17,857
He's getting to be such an old dog.

469
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:21,569
- Yeah. All he does is sleep all day.
- All day.

470
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:26,324
Ket, dear, go open the door.
Jeff wants to go out.

471
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:29,744
Jeff, shut the door
when you're done. Okay?

472
00:45:39,254 --> 00:45:41,798
- There you are.
- What took you so long?

473
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:46,010
- I'm sorry.
- Jeff helped me escape.

474
00:45:48,138 --> 00:45:51,683
Kiki, if we ask him, I bet he'll
take the stuffed one back inside.

475
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:54,936
He'll do it. He's a good dog.

476
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,112
Could you take this in, please?

477
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,395
- How are you? Hungry?
- No, I'm tired.

478
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:38,980
Yeah, me, too. I'm very tired.

479
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,317
We're both gonna sleep well tonight.

480
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,819
By the way, that painter
who found the stuffed cat

481
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,155
told me she wants to do
a drawing with me in it.

482
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,740
- Naked?
- Jiji.

483
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:26,671
Boring.

484
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:37,307
Wake up. You're supposed to be
minding the store.

485
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,184
I am, but today this place is boring.

486
00:48:40,268 --> 00:48:42,312
But it always gets busy about this time.

487
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:45,523
I know that. That's not what I mean.

488
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:47,817
I mean, my customers.

489
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,279
Jiji, if nobody comes in,
I'm gonna have to eat pancakes forever

490
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:55,033
and be fat, fat, fat.

491
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:57,410
And what am I supposed
to do about that?

492
00:48:57,493 --> 00:49:00,913
Well, I like pancakes,
provided they're not burned.

493
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,125
Look, fur ball, when you get as fat
and round as a pancake,

494
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,877
you see if I care.

495
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,387
Beautiful, isn't she?
They tell me she's a clothes designer.

496
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:19,641
Her designs may be fabulous,
but her cat's still a snob.

497
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:25,480
Hello. Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

498
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,940
What? Pardon? Uh, yes, ma'am.

499
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:30,818
About time we got a customer, huh?

500
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:33,529
Yes, ma'am, 4:30 will be a perfect time
to pick it up.

501
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:35,239
If you'll just...

502
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:38,451
And the address?
Yes. The blue roof. Right.

503
00:49:40,244 --> 00:49:43,748
Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have it all.
And thank you very much, ma'am.

504
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,003
Hi.

505
00:49:57,136 --> 00:50:00,181
I'll take this, please. Okay?

506
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,147
Thank you very much. Good afternoon.

507
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:10,358
Oh, come on.
You're not still mad at me, are you?

508
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,860
Listen, we're gonna have a huge party
at the club tonight.

509
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:17,240
It's called the Aviation Club,
and we'd really like for you to come.

510
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:19,242
Here's your invitation.

511
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:25,081
It's a serious club for kids
who are into flying and aircraft and stuff.

512
00:50:25,164 --> 00:50:28,042
And, you know, everybody'd be
really excited if you came.

513
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,711
Yes. May I help you, sir?

514
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,714
They tell me
you have a delivery service.

515
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,383
Uh, oh. I'm sorry.
Yes, of course, we can handle it.

516
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:38,386
It's very urgent this package arrive
as soon as possible.

517
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:39,721
That's no problem.

518
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,349
Are you all right?

519
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,309
- I do this every day.
- Can I help you?

520
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,745
Well, I hope you make up
your mind by 6:00.

521
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:04,996
'Cause that's when I'll be by
to pick you up.

522
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:07,415
- See ya.
- How much will that be?

523
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:10,251
Will that be inside
or outside city limits, sir?

524
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:14,005
- I wrote the address on the box.
- Oh! Oh, the box. Oh, I'm sorry.

525
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,843
Osono! Osono! I've got a big problem.

526
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,513
I got an invitation to go to a party
at Tombo's flying club.

527
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:24,390
I'm sure it'll be a great party, Kiki.

528
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:27,435
No. But my problem is,
what am I going to wear?

529
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:31,314
Kiki, you haven't got a problem.
You look fine in that.

530
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:33,941
Besides, it makes you look
beautiful and mysterious.

531
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:35,568
- Really?
- How's work?

532
00:51:35,651 --> 00:51:39,739
I almost forgot about that.
It's already 4:00. Oh, no.

533
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,951
Can you watch the store
until I get back, Osono?

534
00:51:44,035 --> 00:51:46,120
Jiji? Jiji?

535
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,970
You were so mad at that boy.

536
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:05,389
I don't understand
why you're going to his party.

537
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:09,101
Please don't talk.
I'm trying to fly this broom, okay?

538
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:30,331
Thank you very much. Bye.

539
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:32,250
Come on, Jiji.

540
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,423
We can't keep
our next appointment waiting.

541
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,926
There's the blue roof.

542
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,022
Here we are.

543
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,128
My name's Kiki, and someone
telephoned for a delivery service,

544
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:19,338
so here I am.

545
00:53:19,422 --> 00:53:21,215
Right this way, dear.

546
00:53:27,597 --> 00:53:30,308
- You are right on time.
- Thank you.

547
00:53:34,103 --> 00:53:37,064
Oh, madam, the delivery girl is here.

548
00:53:37,899 --> 00:53:40,651
My, delivery time already?

549
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:45,156
Come in, dear.
Please make yourself right at home.

550
00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:47,283
- Please do.
- Thanks.

551
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:49,327
May I take that for you?

552
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:51,704
Thank you.

553
00:53:58,169 --> 00:53:59,879
Broom and a black cat.

554
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:03,174
Well, it's just as
my great-grandmother told me.

555
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:07,345
- My name's Kiki, and I'm a witch.
- Mmm-hmm.

556
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:10,514
Oh, my, what a pretty witch you are.

557
00:54:11,265 --> 00:54:16,228
I'm so sorry, but that special treat you
were supposed to deliver isn't ready yet.

558
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:21,776
I think there's something wrong with it.

559
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:25,529
It's got a mind of its own,
and it doesn't want to heat up.

560
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:29,867
It's old. Like me, it's seen better days.

561
00:54:29,951 --> 00:54:32,036
I was hoping you'd be able to deliver

562
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:34,789
a dish to my
granddaughter's birthday party.

563
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:39,043
It's my specialty,
herring and pumpkin potpie.

564
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,545
But I must admit defeat.

565
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,465
I'll have to phone her
and tell her I'm sorry.

566
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,342
I feel just awful
having you come here for nothing.

567
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,763
Barsa. Barsa.

568
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:54,976
Would you get Kiki's money, please?

569
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,268
Certainly, madam.

570
00:54:56,602 --> 00:55:00,439
- All of it. Pay her what we agreed on.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

571
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:04,110
Please accept it. This was all my fault.

572
00:55:04,193 --> 00:55:05,569
Yes, but...

573
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:09,740
Ma'am, since I don't have
any other jobs, maybe I can help.

574
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:11,951
How about we use that old oven
over there?

575
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:14,495
Well, maybe.

576
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:19,917
It used to bake beautiful bread,
but I haven't baked in it lately.

577
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:22,670
Well, if it burns firewood,
I can help you.

578
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:25,297
I used to help my mom bake all the time.

579
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,425
But it's such a big job to build a fire.

580
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:31,095
A great idea, ma'am.
I never liked that electric thing.

581
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:34,432
- I think her plan is perfect.
- Ma'am, it'll work, really.

582
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:38,936
You think so? All right then. Let's try it.

583
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,610
Don't blame me
if you're late for your party.

584
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:48,571
I can't take her money and not help out.

585
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,539
Let's go.

586
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:02,710
Madam, here. Look what I found.

587
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:07,339
You're a very clever girl, my dear.
Your mother must be proud.

588
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,101
Oh, well, this is exciting.

589
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:21,771
Mmm-hmm. Yes, this is much better.

590
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,204
It should be about time.

591
00:56:38,287 --> 00:56:40,498
Yes, the fire's almost ready.

592
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:53,385
Now we wait.

593
00:56:53,469 --> 00:56:55,763
You think 40 minutes
should be about right?

594
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,599
Exactly right.
So why don't we take a little break?

595
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,018
Maybe I can help around the house
while the pie is baking.

596
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:04,021
Oh. How nice of you to offer.

597
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,692
- What a wonderful witch.
- There we go.

598
00:57:11,153 --> 00:57:13,155
You're never gonna make the party
on time.

599
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:14,365
Stop worrying-

600
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:17,660
It'll only take me 15 minutes
if I fly there fast.

601
00:57:19,161 --> 00:57:22,331
Would you like some hot tea?
It's no trouble.

602
00:57:23,999 --> 00:57:27,128
Dear! What did you say to me
was the time of your party?

603
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,381
It's at 6:00,
but it's only 15 minutes away.

604
00:57:30,506 --> 00:57:34,844
Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid
my clock runs about 10 minutes slow.

605
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:39,348
- I'm gonna be late.
- Check the potpie and see if it's ready.

606
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,018
Help. Barsa, come.

607
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:46,021
Quickly! We have to hurry.
Kiki is running very late.

608
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,405
- Is the pie baked? Is it ready?
- It seems fine. Now you'd better hurry.

609
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:55,489
Uh-huh.

610
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,167
- We're ready. Come on.
- Okay.

611
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,794
Let me pay you for your time.

612
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:11,255
- But that's much too much.
- Not for all of your help.

613
00:58:11,338 --> 00:58:13,090
Hurry up. Hurry up.

614
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,218
- Have a good time now.
- Here you go.

615
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:17,386
- Bye-bye.
- Fly carefully.

616
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,645
We can beat the rain
if we just fly a little faster.

617
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:28,606
Not according to my whiskers.

618
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,215
Could we get out of the rain, please?
I'm begging you.

619
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:58,802
We can't. That'll make us even later,
and the food will get cold if we stop.

620
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:03,242
Yes? What do you want?

621
01:00:03,617 --> 01:00:06,870
- I have a delivery.
- But it is soaking wet.

622
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:09,290
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.
It began to rain on the way.

623
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:11,542
But don't worry.
The food came through all right.

624
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,711
Oh, no. I told Grandma I didn't want that.

625
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:14,878
Hey, what'd you get?

626
01:00:14,962 --> 01:00:18,173
Oh, Grandma sent me another one
of her crummy herring pies again.

627
01:00:18,257 --> 01:00:19,717
Mmm, yummy. Herring pie.

628
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,886
Uh, will you please sign this receipt
for me?

629
01:00:24,263 --> 01:00:26,473
I hate Grandma's stupid pies.

630
01:00:32,187 --> 01:00:34,565
I cannot believe they're related.

631
01:00:47,786 --> 01:00:49,788
Maybe we still have time.

632
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:15,606
Kiki, there he is.

633
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:18,025
Come on. We can catch him.

634
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:26,325
Kiki, we were all so worried about you.

635
01:01:26,408 --> 01:01:28,786
And that poor boy waited
such a long time.

636
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:32,498
It doesn't matter anyway.
I can't go in these wet clothes.

637
01:01:44,885 --> 01:01:48,806
Kiki, what's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?

638
01:01:49,515 --> 01:01:52,393
Maybe we should eat something, okay?

639
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:21,046
Wake up, Kiki.

640
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,678
Hmm?

641
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,486
Not feeling very well, huh?

642
01:02:47,114 --> 01:02:51,118
- You have quite a fever.
- My head's hurting so much.

643
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:54,371
Well, you flew in that weather
and you never really dried off.

644
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,709
- Do you think I'm going to die, Osono?
- Huh?

645
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:04,798
No, you're not.
I'll bring some medicine right up,

646
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:07,509
and maybe you should have
some potpie.

647
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:08,594
Not that.

648
01:03:09,011 --> 01:03:11,305
Well, then, I'll just make
something else for you.

649
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:14,433
How about some nice hot oatmeal
with honey in it? You want some, too?

650
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,483
This oatmeal will pick you right up.

651
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,735
There you go. Here.

652
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:28,489
Now, don't burn your tongue.

653
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:34,161
You should come and eat your meal
while it's still warm.

654
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:37,748
- Here it is.
- Do I have to eat it?

655
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,374
Only if you want to get well.

656
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:43,003
Oh! You know that boy stopped by
to see you again today.

657
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:45,923
That's right.
When I told him you were sick,

658
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:48,550
he asked me how a witch
could catch cold in the first place.

659
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:53,388
Oh. And he said he wanted
to visit you a little later.

660
01:03:53,472 --> 01:03:54,681
Oh, my gosh. No.

661
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:59,228
Well, I thought you might feel that way,
so I turned him down politely.

662
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:02,064
You must be tired.
You try to get some sleep.

663
01:04:02,147 --> 01:04:05,651
Now, I'll just open up the window
so you'll have some fresh air.

664
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:15,452
- Osono?
- Hmm?

665
01:04:15,827 --> 01:04:18,455
Um... Never mind.

666
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:47,818
Breakfast.

667
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:50,362
Jiji.

668
01:04:51,405 --> 01:04:52,489
What?

669
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:56,827
Mmm. Hmm...

670
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:23,562
- Where are you?
- Kiki?

671
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,940
- Are you feeling better?
- A lot better. Thank you.

672
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:29,526
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd overslept.

673
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:33,113
That's okay. Come down later.
I have a favor to ask you.

674
01:05:33,196 --> 01:05:34,865
- All right?
- Okay.

675
01:05:35,824 --> 01:05:39,286
- The name is "Koppori"?
- Uh-huh. Now, take this money.

676
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:42,289
Oh, no, ma'am. No money. It's on me.

677
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:46,710
Impossible. Work is work,
and make sure you deliver it in person.

678
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:51,131
Jiji.

679
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,885
- What is it?
- We've got a delivery.

680
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:59,473
- Hey. Who's your friend there?
- Lily's her name. Be right there.

681
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,393
Stay there. I'll be right back.
He's all yours. Bye-bye.

682
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:54,945
It's so pretty and warm.

683
01:07:01,243 --> 01:07:04,538
Hey. Hey, there, Miss Witch.

684
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:10,001
Taking a walk?

685
01:07:10,085 --> 01:07:12,838
Uh-uh. I'm looking for someone
named Koppori.

686
01:07:13,922 --> 01:07:15,382
Hey, that's my name. That's me.

687
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:19,886
If you go around that way,
I'll be right with you, okay?

688
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:21,138
Okay.

689
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,976
Osono, how could you do this to me?

690
01:07:27,978 --> 01:07:29,104
Hi.

691
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:32,858
Gee, thanks a lot.

692
01:07:38,363 --> 01:07:40,991
About the other night.
I'm sorry I didn't show up.

693
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:44,494
Huh? Mmm-mmm. I'm sorry
you had to end up so sick like that.

694
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:48,999
Hey, come over to my place.
There's something I wanna show you.

695
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,376
Oh, you gotta see it.

696
01:07:55,005 --> 01:07:57,090
The party was to celebrate
the completion of this thing.

697
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:58,175
What do you think?

698
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:03,138
This is the engine
of a man-propelled plane.

699
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,598
Watch this.

700
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:09,603
We're going to assemble the wings and
the frame at somebody else's house.

701
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:13,815
I'm planning on flying this thing
during most of my summer vacation.

702
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:20,447
Miss Witch, I got a great idea.

703
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:23,366
Why don't we go down to the beach
where that dirigible landed yesterday?

704
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:26,369
- Dirigible?
- Don't tell me you didn't hear about it?

705
01:08:26,453 --> 01:08:29,080
- I was sick.
- Then we gotta see it. Let's do it.

706
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:32,125
- We're going on this?
- Why not?

707
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:35,629
I have to practice all the time anyway.
Gotta build up my legs.

708
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:37,756
Okay. Ready?

709
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,049
Um...

710
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:48,141
- This is my first time on a bike.
- Oh, boy. Just hold on.

711
01:08:48,225 --> 01:08:52,312
Brace the bike with your foot
until I get her revved up. Let's go.

712
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:00,445
Okay.

713
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:05,992
Kick off. Now! Good!

714
01:09:09,955 --> 01:09:12,374
- Should I get off?
- No.

715
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,777
Hey, look at that. Whoa.

716
01:09:44,906 --> 01:09:46,575
Bye!

717
01:09:46,658 --> 01:09:49,369
Lean your body to the inside
when we go around the curve.

718
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,495
Why?

719
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:53,039
Because otherwise
we're gonna have trouble turning.

720
01:09:54,499 --> 01:09:55,750
Now.

721
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:01,131
Great. You're doing fine.

722
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:06,678
Now, put your weight into it again.
That's it!

723
01:10:06,761 --> 01:10:08,513
We're quite a team.

724
01:10:10,515 --> 01:10:12,767
All right. We're doing great.

725
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:19,649
Wow.

726
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:25,030
- That's the dirigible, right?
- Right.

727
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:35,957
We're flying.

728
01:10:37,459 --> 01:10:39,252
Oh, my God!

729
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,175
Uh, boy!

730
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:04,277
What happened, Tombo? Are you okay?

731
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:07,280
- Yeah. Are you?
- I'm okay.

732
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,038
What are you laughing at?

733
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:21,544
- Hmm?
- Your face.

734
01:11:29,094 --> 01:11:30,720
Do I really look that funny?

735
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:36,893
I'm sorry, but when we flew up,
I was so scared.

736
01:11:40,814 --> 01:11:42,273
Yeah, me, too.

737
01:11:43,108 --> 01:11:45,151
Was it your magic
that made us stay up?

738
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,529
I'm not sure. Anything's possible.

739
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,240
Your bike's a real mess.

740
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,869
My propeller. I have to go get it, Kiki.

741
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:56,496
Will you keep an eye
on my bike for me?

742
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:00,583
- Uh-huh. What went wrong?
- I think I pedaled too hard.

743
01:12:00,667 --> 01:12:03,586
That's why it busted.
You wait here. I'll be right back.

744
01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:29,529
How great would it be to go
around the world in a dirigible like that?

745
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:32,407
Of course, you were flying
since you were very young, huh?

746
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,326
Well, yes. Since I was a baby.

747
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:38,246
My mother used to take me with her.
She taught me never to be scared.

748
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:42,292
Gosh. You're so lucky, Kiki.
I wish I could fly.

749
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:44,919
People like you can just fly away
on a broomstick.

750
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:46,212
But me?

751
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,215
That's all I can do.

752
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:52,677
Flying used to be fun
until I started doing it for a living.

753
01:12:53,094 --> 01:12:56,639
Hey, wait. You can't not enjoy flying.
You're a witch.

754
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,184
I know. I still feel that way though.

755
01:12:59,476 --> 01:13:03,605
But I'm very glad I came with you today.
I feel much better sitting by the beach.

756
01:13:03,688 --> 01:13:05,398
Why don't I bring you here
whenever you want

757
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:07,525
and train myself at the same time?

758
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:10,570
- You're a very nice person.
- Huh? You just found that out?

759
01:13:10,653 --> 01:13:13,239
Sorry. But at first I thought
you were such a clown.

760
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:14,824
You know, my mom says
the same thing.

761
01:13:14,908 --> 01:13:16,284
"Don't be such a clown.

762
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:19,245
"Quit looking up at the sky,
and get back to your books."

763
01:13:21,414 --> 01:13:22,999
- Look at him.
- Tombo!

764
01:13:24,334 --> 01:13:26,753
- Hey, Tombo!
- Huh?

765
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:30,256
- Guess what's up, Tombo?
- What?

766
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:34,052
Something really great.
You're gonna love it. Come on over.

767
01:13:34,135 --> 01:13:36,304
I'll be back in a sec, okay?

768
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:42,977
We're all gonna get to go
for a ride in the blimp.

769
01:13:43,061 --> 01:13:44,646
Really? Wow! That's great.

770
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:46,481
Hey, who's your friend?

771
01:13:46,564 --> 01:13:48,191
That's Kiki. I'll get her to come over.

772
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:50,193
Hey, come over and meet the gang, Kiki.

773
01:13:50,318 --> 01:13:53,530
We're all going for a tour
inside the Spirit of Freedom.

774
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:57,867
- Thanks, but I don't want to.
- Oh. Why not? It'll be fun.

775
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:01,371
She made a delivery
to my house on my birthday.

776
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:04,457
- You mean, she's working, at her age?
- Well, I'll be.

777
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:06,960
Come on.
I'll introduce you to everybody.

778
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:10,922
- No thanks. See you later.
- What's the matter?

779
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:14,384
Hey!

780
01:14:15,426 --> 01:14:16,928
What are you so mad about?

781
01:14:17,011 --> 01:14:19,639
I'm not mad at all, Tombo.
I have a lot on my mind.

782
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:22,058
So, please, just leave me alone.

783
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:23,643
Huh?

784
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,565
Forget her, Tombo. Come on.

785
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:27,373
And don't forget
that this summer, the hit music...

786
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,373
Jiji, I think something's wrong with me.

787
01:16:08,456 --> 01:16:12,293
I meet a lot of people, and at first
everything seems to be going okay,

788
01:16:12,794 --> 01:16:15,380
but then I start feeling like
such an outsider.

789
01:16:15,463 --> 01:16:18,258
You should have seen
how Tombo's friends looked at me.

790
01:16:19,592 --> 01:16:22,178
Hey, where are you going?

791
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,348
Oh.

792
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:27,558
Some friend you are.

793
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:43,574
Kiki's
Delivery Service

794
01:16:58,756 --> 01:17:01,384
Hey! You know,
you can't be late for every meal

795
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:03,428
just because you have a new girlfriend.

796
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:05,513
And you can wash your plate yourself.

797
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,392
Why are you talking like a cat?

798
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:15,690
Huh?

799
01:17:17,191 --> 01:17:18,609
Oh, my.

800
01:17:18,693 --> 01:17:20,653
Oh, no. Talk to me, Jiji.

801
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:23,156
You mean you can't speak anymore?

802
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:27,910
Jiji?

803
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:29,954
What's going on with him?

804
01:17:30,038 --> 01:17:32,332
I can't understand anything
he's trying to say.

805
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,044
What if it means... Oh, my goodness.

806
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:00,777
I'm losing my witch's powers.

807
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:03,464
What do you mean?
You haven't lost your magic, have you?

808
01:19:03,548 --> 01:19:05,633
It's become very weak, so I...

809
01:19:05,716 --> 01:19:08,678
Well, I think I've got to take
a break from my delivery work.

810
01:19:08,761 --> 01:19:11,180
But I promise I'll be really good
with my work in the bakery,

811
01:19:11,264 --> 01:19:13,182
so please let me stay
in the room upstairs.

812
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:15,393
Well, that's no problem.

813
01:19:15,476 --> 01:19:18,563
I'll bet your powers come back
after you've had some rest.

814
01:19:18,646 --> 01:19:21,816
I really don't know.
Maybe if I make a new broom.

815
01:19:26,237 --> 01:19:27,905
Hey. Look at that.

816
01:20:03,232 --> 01:20:05,818
Hi, Kiki. It's me, Tombo.
Did you see me today?

817
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:07,487
I was waving at you from the dirigible,

818
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:10,781
'cause the captain let me come into
the control cabin during the test run.

819
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:12,492
Boy, did I have a cool time.

820
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:16,871
- Hello? Kiki? Are you there?
- Please don't call me anymore.

821
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:19,165
What did you say?
I can barely hear you.

822
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,626
You know what the captain said...

823
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:24,003
What? Kiki? She hung up.

824
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,092
What's the matter, dear?
Is there anything I can do for you?

825
01:20:31,052 --> 01:20:33,179
I'm still in training to become a witch.

826
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:36,974
If I lose my magic, that means
I've lost absolutely everything.

827
01:20:37,058 --> 01:20:38,309
Kiki.

828
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:01,123
Uh-huh. It's right over there
across the street.

829
01:21:06,337 --> 01:21:08,130
Kiki? Kiki?

830
01:21:09,215 --> 01:21:10,341
Hey!

831
01:21:11,342 --> 01:21:12,885
- Hi.
- Hi.

832
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,387
Well, since you didn't come
and visit me,

833
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,390
- I thought I'd come here and visit you.
- I'm sorry.

834
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:20,142
Well, that's sort of a white lie.
I need to do some shopping, too.

835
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:23,396
Come on in, 'cause I'm done now,
and I can take a break, okay?

836
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:25,815
You better believe I will.

837
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:30,903
Nice place you have.

838
01:21:30,987 --> 01:21:33,239
Help yourself to some of these,
and I'll go make us some tea.

839
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:35,449
No tea, thanks,
but some milk if you have any.

840
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:36,659
Sure.

841
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:44,417
Hey, there. Unbelievable.

842
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,586
You're the spitting image
of that stuffed cat.

843
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:49,880
I bet your name's Jiji, right?
Coming through.

844
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:53,342
So, how's the delivery biz?
You making any money?

845
01:21:57,388 --> 01:22:00,516
- That bad, huh?
- I'm not working much now.

846
01:22:01,642 --> 01:22:02,977
Mmm-hmm.

847
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:13,446
Hmm. I kind of thought
you looked unhappy.

848
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,449
I didn't know things like that
happened to witches.

849
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:24,874
Hey! Why don't you come
and stay at my cabin?

850
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,250
Huh?

851
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:30,379
It'll probably make you feel better.
Your boss would let you have a break.

852
01:22:30,463 --> 01:22:32,214
How about it, kitty-cat? Wanna come?

853
01:22:34,634 --> 01:22:35,718
Hmm?

854
01:22:37,345 --> 01:22:38,846
Rather be with your girlfriend, huh?

855
01:22:38,929 --> 01:22:40,973
Come on, girl. Why not?
We'll leave now.

856
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:43,142
Uh-huh.

857
01:22:46,812 --> 01:22:48,064
Come on.

858
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,070
Hurry. Hurry. The bus is leaving.

859
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:45,955
Okay, now I'm officially exhausted.

860
01:23:47,081 --> 01:23:48,916
It's beautiful here.

861
01:23:59,009 --> 01:24:00,261
What's the matter with you?

862
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:02,388
Must've been blinded by two
beautiful girls in front of him.

863
01:24:10,938 --> 01:24:11,981
Hey!

864
01:24:25,745 --> 01:24:28,330
Huh? You really thought I was a boy?

865
01:24:28,414 --> 01:24:30,833
Well, it's the way you're dressed
and all.

866
01:24:32,001 --> 01:24:34,336
Tell me. What kind of a boy
has these legs, mister?

867
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:46,265
- You get along with the crows.
- Yup. We've become real close friends.

868
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:49,602
- Wow!
- Hello, everybody. I'm home again.

869
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:52,563
Good afternoon. I wanna say I'm sorry.

870
01:24:57,693 --> 01:25:00,613
Why don't you go inside,
and I'll go get some water?

871
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:01,822
Okay.

872
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,004
- Like it?
- Yes.

873
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:02,091
I have to say I became inspired
after the first time we met.

874
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:05,636
But I really haven't got the face right.

875
01:26:07,179 --> 01:26:09,849
I've been waiting for you to come back
so I can try again.

876
01:26:09,932 --> 01:26:12,184
- You mean that's me?
- Sure is.

877
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:14,645
You'd make my life easier
if you'd model for me.

878
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:17,982
But I'm not very beautiful.
What do you want me to do that for?

879
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:24,405
Come on, Kiki.
You have got a great face.

880
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:25,865
You're very pretty.

881
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:28,951
Now, don't you be nervous.
Sit down over here.

882
01:26:32,872 --> 01:26:37,793
Raise your chin up a little.
Look straight ahead. Now, don't move.

883
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:42,006
Painting and magical powers
seem very much the same.

884
01:26:42,089 --> 01:26:43,966
Sometimes I'm unable to paint a thing.

885
01:26:44,174 --> 01:26:46,844
You mean it?
Then what? What happens?

886
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:50,347
Kiki, please, don't move.
It's hard to draw a moving target.

887
01:26:51,599 --> 01:26:55,227
Without even thinking about it,
I used to be able to fly.

888
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:58,981
Now I'm trying to look inside myself
to find out how I did it.

889
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:01,233
But I just can't figure it out.

890
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:04,069
You know, it could be
you're working at it too hard.

891
01:27:04,153 --> 01:27:06,196
Maybe you should just take a break.

892
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,949
Yeah, but still, if I can't fly...

893
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:12,286
Then stop trying. Take long walks.
Look at the scenery.

894
01:27:12,369 --> 01:27:15,331
Doze off at noon.
Don't even think about flying.

895
01:27:15,497 --> 01:27:17,917
And then, pretty soon,
you'll be flying again.

896
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,962
- You think my problems will...
- Go away? That's right.

897
01:27:22,046 --> 01:27:24,298
It's gonna be fine. I promise.

898
01:27:42,983 --> 01:27:46,737
When I was your age,
I'd already decided to become an artist.

899
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,739
I loved to paint so much.

900
01:27:48,822 --> 01:27:51,825
I'd paint all day until I fell asleep
right at my easel.

901
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:55,120
And then one day, for some reason,
I just couldn't paint anymore.

902
01:27:55,621 --> 01:27:58,999
I tried and tried,
but nothing I did seemed any good.

903
01:28:00,376 --> 01:28:03,879
They were copies of paintings
I'd seen somewhere before,

904
01:28:04,213 --> 01:28:06,632
and not very good copies, either.

905
01:28:07,132 --> 01:28:09,593
I just felt like I'd lost my ability.

906
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:11,971
That sounds like me.

907
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:16,976
It's exactly the same,
but then I found the answer.

908
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:20,312
You see, I hadn't figured out
what or why I wanted to paint.

909
01:28:20,396 --> 01:28:22,481
I had to discover my own style.

910
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:25,651
When you fly, you rely on
what's inside of you, don't you?

911
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:28,445
Uh-huh. We fly with our spirit.

912
01:28:28,529 --> 01:28:32,116
Trusting your spirit. Yes, yes!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

913
01:28:32,825 --> 01:28:36,912
That same spirit is what makes me paint
and makes your friend bake.

914
01:28:37,287 --> 01:28:40,666
But we each need to find
our own inspiration, Kiki.

915
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:42,918
Sometimes it's not easy.

916
01:28:44,044 --> 01:28:47,506
I guess I never gave much thought
to why I wanted to do this.

917
01:28:47,589 --> 01:28:51,218
I got so caught up
in all the training and stuff.

918
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:54,722
Maybe I have to find my own inspiration.

919
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:59,351
But am I ever going to find it?
And is it worth all the trouble?

920
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:01,687
Well, for example,
there were quite a few times

921
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:04,690
when I thought of painting
something over that painting.

922
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:07,526
But it ended up being so great.

923
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:08,986
So I guess it's worth it.

924
01:29:09,403 --> 01:29:11,989
Today when I saw you,
I thought, "I wanna paint."

925
01:29:12,072 --> 01:29:15,451
- You've got such a great face.
- That's why I came?

926
01:29:17,494 --> 01:29:19,872
Hey, well, it's better than you
cleaning my floor again.

927
01:29:19,955 --> 01:29:22,750
- Let's turn out the lights and go to sleep.
- Okay.

928
01:29:24,293 --> 01:29:26,336
Sorry about taking your bed from you.

929
01:29:26,420 --> 01:29:27,796
Ah, no problem.

930
01:29:31,258 --> 01:29:33,761
- So you really think I'll fly again?
- Sure.

931
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:36,388
You'll just have to wait for
the right inspiration to come along.

932
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:38,682
- You understand?
- Uh-huh.

933
01:29:43,187 --> 01:29:45,439
And there it is, folks,
the Spirit of Freedom.

934
01:29:45,522 --> 01:29:46,774
Recently downed in a spectacular
forced landing...

935
01:29:47,983 --> 01:29:50,694
due to torrential rains
just outside the city limits.

936
01:29:50,778 --> 01:29:52,905
Well, it's been repaired,
and is now in final preparation...

937
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:55,199
Yes? Good Cooking Pan Bakery.

938
01:29:55,657 --> 01:29:57,326
Kiki. How are you?

939
01:29:58,827 --> 01:30:01,080
Well, you take plenty of time
coming home.

940
01:30:01,163 --> 01:30:04,083
Oh, and by the way, that older woman
you made a delivery for?

941
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:06,085
- Uh-huh.
- She has another delivery for you.

942
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:07,669
I said I wasn't sure you could do it.

943
01:30:08,087 --> 01:30:11,548
She was really very insistent.
What do you think, Kiki?

944
01:30:12,674 --> 01:30:15,594
Great. Stop there
on your way back. Bye.

945
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:18,388
Thank you so much for everything.

946
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:39,076
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Well, well, we've been expecting you.

947
01:30:40,244 --> 01:30:41,495
Thanks.

948
01:30:43,664 --> 01:30:45,999
There are less than five
minutes to takeoff now.

949
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,753
Um. It's very nice
to see you again, ma'am.

950
01:30:49,837 --> 01:30:53,132
I'm glad you came.
Please excuse me for not standing.

951
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,676
My legs are bothering me
more than usual.

952
01:30:55,759 --> 01:31:00,889
- Barsa, bring the package now.
- Gosh, I hope it hasn't taken off.

953
01:31:00,973 --> 01:31:05,894
Not yet. Barsa is absolutely mad
about lighter-than-air travel.

954
01:31:05,978 --> 01:31:08,313
- I'm the adventuresome type.
- Mmm-hmm.

955
01:31:09,356 --> 01:31:10,899
Could you turn it down, please?

956
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:14,236
Would you do me a favor
and open the box?

957
01:31:14,653 --> 01:31:15,737
Yup.

958
01:31:23,453 --> 01:31:24,496
I don't get it.

959
01:31:24,997 --> 01:31:27,791
Would you please bring this
to a young delivery girl?

960
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:29,835
She was kind to me
and a very big help.

961
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:31,879
It's my way of saying thank you.

962
01:31:31,962 --> 01:31:35,382
Ah, yes, and can you find out
when her next birthday is?

963
01:31:35,549 --> 01:31:37,885
Then I can bake her another one.

964
01:31:44,266 --> 01:31:45,434
Kiki?

965
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:52,441
Of course, I will. And maybe the young
girl will want to know the lady's birthday,

966
01:31:52,524 --> 01:31:55,527
because she'll be able
to give her a present to repay her.

967
01:31:55,611 --> 01:31:57,029
You've got a deal.

968
01:32:11,627 --> 01:32:15,130
- What happened?
- Oh, there's been a terrible accident.

969
01:32:24,181 --> 01:32:28,268
Oh, darn this old thing.
And just when it was getting good.

970
01:32:29,019 --> 01:32:31,647
Midsummer is always
when these winds come.

971
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:33,857
They'll be hitting us any minute.

972
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,319
Goodness. It's a strong one.

973
01:32:37,945 --> 01:32:40,239
It'll pass quickly. Don't worry.

974
01:32:40,322 --> 01:32:43,659
Oh, goody! It's back on. Look.

975
01:32:45,035 --> 01:32:48,038
Oh, look at that.
It's completely upside down.

976
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:49,831
Freak winds blowing in from the sea.

977
01:32:49,915 --> 01:32:54,294
- It has broken loose from...
- My, my. How terrible.

978
01:32:54,378 --> 01:32:56,505
A desperate
last-ditch effort is being made

979
01:32:56,588 --> 01:32:58,257
to tie the dirigible to the ground

980
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,008
and keep it from drifting into the air.

981
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:03,804
But it's extremely doubtful whether
or not this can actually be done.

982
01:33:04,179 --> 01:33:06,181
Oh, no, no. It's useless.

983
01:33:06,431 --> 01:33:08,684
The tremendous lifting power
of the helium balloon

984
01:33:08,767 --> 01:33:10,227
is lifting the police patrol car...

985
01:33:10,352 --> 01:33:13,438
That's Tombo.
That's my friend hanging on that rope.

986
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:14,898
It's being lifted like a toy.

987
01:33:14,982 --> 01:33:17,484
Oh, no, there's a young boy
hanging onto the cable.

988
01:33:17,567 --> 01:33:19,945
He's being lifted away together
with the police car.

989
01:33:20,028 --> 01:33:21,947
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

990
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,825
The dirigible
is being blown towards town.

991
01:33:27,286 --> 01:33:29,955
- Are you sure it's your friend, my dear?
- I have to go.

992
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:32,708
- Be careful.
- Oh, dear. Oh! Oh!

993
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:45,554
- Come on. Over here.
- Over here.

994
01:33:57,482 --> 01:34:00,819
Hold on there, son.
Just hold your grip steady.

995
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,612
Release the helium from the tail. Quick!

996
01:34:28,638 --> 01:34:34,269
All citizens
are kindly requested to remain calm.

997
01:34:38,982 --> 01:34:41,234
Sir, is there any word about the boy?

998
01:34:41,318 --> 01:34:44,988
All I know is that the radio said
that the police car dropped into a pool.

999
01:34:48,533 --> 01:34:50,035
He's still up there.

1000
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:00,295
Stay out of the street.

1001
01:35:00,379 --> 01:35:05,008
Get on the sidewalks. You there.
Young lady. Don't block the street.

1002
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:07,594
Do not block the street.

1003
01:35:07,677 --> 01:35:09,930
Are you all right, young lady?

1004
01:35:14,726 --> 01:35:17,062
Please, sir, may I use your broom
for a minute?

1005
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:19,731
- What?
- Please. I promise I'll bring it right back.

1006
01:35:19,815 --> 01:35:21,650
Huh? I'm not gonna give you
my broom...

1007
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:23,402
- Thank you very much.
- Hey!

1008
01:35:59,938 --> 01:36:01,022
Fly.

1009
01:36:05,986 --> 01:36:07,195
Watch out!

1010
01:36:32,929 --> 01:36:35,557
Come on, broom, fly for me.

1011
01:36:42,856 --> 01:36:44,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
it appears that the blimp

1012
01:36:44,983 --> 01:36:46,985
is heading directly for the clock tower.

1013
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:50,363
And look! The young boy is safe,
but he's clutching that rope for dear life.

1014
01:36:50,447 --> 01:36:53,492
If the wind doesn't shift, the Spirit
of Freedom will smash into the tower!

1015
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:57,454
We gotta get up higher
or else we'll hit the tower, Captain.

1016
01:36:57,537 --> 01:37:01,583
There's not enough helium.
Jump onto the tower before we hit.

1017
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,293
Aye, aye, Captain.

1018
01:37:03,376 --> 01:37:05,670
Hey, there. Over here. Come on.

1019
01:37:05,754 --> 01:37:07,672
Get outta the way.
The blimp's gonna crash!

1020
01:37:07,756 --> 01:37:09,549
Grab a hold of this.

1021
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:21,978
Go!

1022
01:37:25,941 --> 01:37:27,234
Hurry up!

1023
01:37:33,615 --> 01:37:34,783
Hey!

1024
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,169
We are listening to the sound
of a helium gas leak.

1025
01:37:46,253 --> 01:37:49,506
The condition of the boy is unknown,
but from where I'm standing...

1026
01:37:54,803 --> 01:37:58,390
It's falling. Too much gas has escaped.
It's coming down!

1027
01:38:08,275 --> 01:38:10,068
It's snagged on the building
across the street...

1028
01:38:10,151 --> 01:38:12,529
Hey, look. Over there.

1029
01:38:12,612 --> 01:38:13,655
It's a miracle.

1030
01:38:13,738 --> 01:38:16,575
The young boy has somehow managed
to keep his hold on the rope.

1031
01:38:16,658 --> 01:38:19,077
But how can anyone rescue him now?

1032
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,955
That brave young boy
is hanging on for dear life.

1033
01:38:22,038 --> 01:38:24,541
He can't... Something just flew by.

1034
01:38:24,624 --> 01:38:28,628
It's a bird? No, it's not a bird.
It's a young girl. No.

1035
01:38:29,212 --> 01:38:31,590
It's a young witch soaring through
the sky, and she's riding...

1036
01:38:31,798 --> 01:38:33,758
- Go, Kiki.
- Oh, my.

1037
01:38:33,842 --> 01:38:35,218
She can fly again.

1038
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,095
Get him, Kiki.

1039
01:38:37,178 --> 01:38:38,680
- Tombo.
- Kiki.

1040
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:40,640
Tombo.

1041
01:38:40,765 --> 01:38:45,520
Come on. Be a good broom.
Hold on, Tombo.

1042
01:38:46,521 --> 01:38:48,940
Hang in there, my good lad.

1043
01:38:54,195 --> 01:38:56,031
- Kiki.
- Tombo.

1044
01:39:01,161 --> 01:39:03,288
And she's trying to reach the boy!

1045
01:39:03,371 --> 01:39:06,875
- You can do it. Yes.
- Don't give up now, sonny.

1046
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:09,210
Come on!

1047
01:39:09,336 --> 01:39:11,921
Don't give up. Don't give up.

1048
01:39:12,005 --> 01:39:15,175
Don't give up. Don't give up.
Don't give up.

1049
01:39:21,848 --> 01:39:25,560
She got him. She saved the boy.
I've never seen anything so amazing.

1050
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:35,570
Congratulations, young lady.

1051
01:39:39,616 --> 01:39:42,494
Now, she's bringing him
down to land, safe and sound.

1052
01:39:42,577 --> 01:39:45,121
She actually caught the boy in midair.

1053
01:39:45,205 --> 01:39:48,041
You saw it all live as she saved his life.

1054
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:51,336
That broom she used was mine.
That was my broom, you know.

1055
01:39:51,419 --> 01:39:53,546
Oh, Barsa. Oh, my.

1056
01:39:55,423 --> 01:39:58,760
Kiki was so brave.
She really saved the day.

1057
01:40:01,137 --> 01:40:04,140
Better call the hospital, honey.
I think it's time now.

1058
01:40:12,732 --> 01:40:13,983
Jiji.

1059
01:42:53,643 --> 01:42:54,644
Hey!

1060
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:58,022
Listen, we just got a letter from Kiki.

1061
01:42:58,106 --> 01:42:59,148
Huh?

1062
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:03,820
"Dear Mother and Father,
How are you doing?

1063
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:07,073
"I'm happy to say that Jiji and I
are doing fine at the moment."

1064
01:43:07,156 --> 01:43:09,659
My delivery service
is a big success.

1065
01:43:09,742 --> 01:43:11,661
I've really started to gain
some confidence

1066
01:43:11,744 --> 01:43:14,122
and everything is falling into place.

1067
01:43:14,205 --> 01:43:17,500
There are still some times
when I feel a little homesick,

1068
01:43:17,584 --> 01:43:20,295
but all in all, I sure love this city.
